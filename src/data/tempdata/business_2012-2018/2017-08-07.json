      "bodyText": "A booming City and rising house prices provided a double boost to Britons holding assets in 2016 as they pushed the nation\u2019s wealth through the \u00a310tn mark, according to a new survey. Lloyds Bank\u2019s private banking arm said total household wealth in the UK increased by \u00a3892bn last year \u2013 with the property and financial markets each responsible for half the rise. News of the 9% jump in the value of the assets from \u00a39.6tn to \u00a310.5tn during 2016 is likely to rekindle the debate about the UK\u2019s wealth inequality. Previous surveys have shown that a tenth of adults own half the nation\u2019s wealth, while 15% own nothing or have negative wealth. The Bank of England has acknowledged that the richest 10% of Britons gained most from the money creation programme known as quantitative easing, since the increase in the supply of credit boosted demand for financial assets. Since the better off held a greater proportion of these assets, 40% of the gains of rising share and bond prices went to the richest 5% of households. In a separate report released on Tuesday, the Social Market Foundation said more than 14 million working age adults were not saving at all, and more than 26 million adults did not hold adequate rainy day or pension savings. Lloyds said the value of assets had risen far faster than prices or incomes over the past decade. The \u00a33.9tn increase in the value of residential property and financial assets owned by UK residents represented a 59% rise, whereas prices rose by 39% and gross household income was up 37%. Other surveys have come up with higher estimates of total household wealth, but Lloyds said its figure excluded non-residential property and assets held by charities and other non-profit institutions. The survey said average house prices rose by 4.9% during 2016 and an additional 183,000 homes were added to the stock of private properties to buy and rent. This resulted in housing wealth contributing an estimated \u00a3431bn to the overall increase in wealth. The total value of financial assets \u2013 such as bank and building society deposits, government bonds, shares in companies, life assurance and pensions held by households \u2013 increased by a \u00a3461bn, or 8%. Sarah Deaves, private banking director at Lloyds Bank, said: \u201cFor many people, their overall wealth is locked up in assets that they hold for the longer term like their homes, their pensions, ISAs and investments. With rising house and equity prices, net worth has increased substantially in the past decade, growing by \u00a3143,000 per household on average. \u201cIncreasing levels of wealth are clearly positive for households, but with recent changes, like pensions freedoms, it also highlights the increasing importance of proper financial planning, especially as people approach and move into retirement.\u201d The Halifax, an arm of Lloyds Bank, said in its monthly snapshot of the property market that house price inflation had eased since the turn of the year. Prices in January were 5.7% higher than a year earlier but by July the annual rate of increase had fallen to 2.1%. In the three months to July, the Halifax said prices fell by 0.2%. It added that this was the fourth month in succession that prices had been dropping on a quarterly basis \u2013 the first time this had happened in five years. Russell Galley, the managing director of the Halifax bank, said the annual house price increase was the lowest seen since April 2013. \u201cThe rise in the employment level by 175,000 in the three months to May helped push the unemployment rate down to 4.5%, the lowest since June 1975. However, this improvement in the jobs market has not, as yet, boosted wage growth, resulting in earnings rising at a slower rate than consumer prices,\u201d he said. \u201cThis squeeze on spending power, together with the impact on property transactions of the stamp duty changes in 2016 now being realised, along with affordability concerns, appear to have contributed to weaker housing demand. \u201cHowever, a continued low mortgage rate environment, combined with an ongoing shortage of properties for sale, should help continue to support house prices over the coming months.\u201d",

Rapha, founded by branding consultant and lifelong cyclist Simon Mottram in 2004, announced on Monday that it had been sold to RZC Investments, a private equity firm run by Steuart and Tom Walton. They are grandchildren of Sam Walton, founder of Walmart. The sale values Mottram\u2019s stake in the business at \u00a325m, although the company said he would retain a \u201csignificant part\u201d of his shareholding and would remain chief executive of the business. Many of Mottram\u2019s friends and family are also shareholders. \u201cThis is an exciting day for Rapha,\u201d Mottram said. \u201cThe arrival of RZC Investments as a shareholder means we can pursue our mission to elevate cycling as a global sport and recruit more participants by engaging them and enabling them to ride with us at all levels.\u201d Mottram said the cash injection from RZC would be spent on its global expansion, with plans for 100 stores or \u201cclubhouses\u201d around the world. The company, named after a defunct French cycling team from the late 1950s, has stores as far afield as Seoul and Chicago. Steuart Walton, co-founder of RZC, said: \u201cRapha represents the very best in the world of cycling. Our investment demonstrates our enthusiasm for its quality products, amazing community of cyclists and customers and its strong future. Rapha\u2019s strategic vision has set the company on a path of tremendous growth and opportunity.\u201d The company, which employs 450 people, recorded sales of \u00a363m last year, a 30% increase on the previous year, as it tapped demand for its high-end gear. While Rapha may not be a household name, in the tribal cycling community it is seen as a \u201cMarmite\u201d brand, at the centre of fierce forum debates where detractors see it as the fiefdom of wealthy metrosexuals or the \u201cRaphia\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Take your pick. House prices in the UK are rising at their slowest annual rate for four years, according to the Halifax\u2019s index. Alternatively, June\u2019s increase was the strongest monthly increase this year. As ever with house prices, it\u2019s best to prefer the longer perspective. On this occasion, that means ignoring the June\u2019s very modest month-on-month pick-up of 0.4% and concentrating on the underlying trend. The mood is best captured by the fact that the May-July period recorded the fourth quarterly fall in a row, the first time that has happened since November 2012. In short, the market has slowed significantly this year. The annual rate of increase was 5.7% in January; now it is 2.1%. This should be seen as excellent news, even if estate agents and those seeking a quick sale of their property may disagree. Back in March last year, house prices were rising at an annual rate of 10%, which was completely unsustainable given how slowly wages are increasing. Indeed, the position was becoming dangerous, especially from the Bank of England\u2019s viewpoint. Double-digit house price inflation and rock-bottom interest rates make an unhealthy cocktail. It\u2019s too glib to say the referendum results turned the market. The vote for Brexit has been a factor, especially in London, but other forces are at work. The biggest is the sheer expense of houses relative to earnings. Average house prices remain about six times average earnings, a level last seen in 2007, just before the banking crash and recession. \u201cAffordability concerns\u201d, as the Halifax coyly puts it, are the reason why the current tepid conditions will probably continue for a while. The only obvious countering pressure is the shortage of homes on the market, which is at all-time low according to the lender. Overall, economists predict house price inflation of 2% this year, a forecast that may even prove to be on the high side. Paddy Power Betfair takes a punt outside the industry Breon Corcoran, chief executive of Paddy Power Betfair, is 46, which is young to choose to quit as a successful boss of a FTSE 100 company. Shareholders may also feel it\u2019s a bit early. Paddy Power and Betfair merged only 18 months ago and, after the initial enthusiastic applause, the share price has faded. If Corcoran longs for fresh adventures, which seems to be the case, it would be understandable. He\u2019s done 16 years in total at the two halves of the company. He quit as chief operating officer of Paddy Power in 2011 to lead a successful rehabilitation of Betfair. He then masterminded the \u00a35bn merger with his old shop. \u201cThere is never a good time to leave,\u201d he says now. Shareholders would agree. From \u00a398 last August, the shares are \u00a375.50, down 370p on Monday, so he can\u2019t be said to be going out at the top in stock market terms. He, and the company, could argue that operations have been integrated faster than planned and profit forecasts this year look solid. Even so, the owners would probably prefer the full \u00a350m of promised savings to reach the bottom line before the architect of the deal departs. The replacement is Peter Jackson, 41, who, after a \u201crigorous and extensive\u201d global search, has found within the boardroom. He is one of the non-executive directors. Jackson fits the bill from the important technology angle. His background is in banking and currency exchange, plus a six-month stint as UK boss of Worldpay, the payments firm. But Jackson\u2019s experience in the gambling industry is confined to four years as a non-executive. Maybe that\u2019s sufficient training and there is, after all, no golden rule that bookies must appoint hardened bookmakers. All the same, you can understand why investors took fright. Paddy Power Betfair is the biggest online gambling firm in the world on some measures and its new jockey is a merely a promising newcomer. Energy big six flowing against Ofgem current The costs of supplying electricity are soaring, British Gas told us last week when it lifted prices by 12.5% \u2013 equivalent to \u00a376 on an average dual fuel bill. But what\u2019s this? Regulator Ofgem is moving in the opposite direction. It is cutting up to \u00a319 off bills for 3 million customers with pre-payment meters. Ofgem says costs have fallen since its \u201csafeguard\u201d tariff was introduced in February. In the tangled world of energy prices, half an explanation is possible. British Gas was looking back a few years, rather than a few months, when it was talking about costs. The company may also buy energy two years in advance, whereas Ofgem uses shorter horizons when doing its sums. All the same, the gap between the regulator\u2019s dual-fuel pre-payment tariff, which works out at \u00a31,048 for a typical customer, and the standard variable prices of the big six is starting to look wide. British Gas put its own dual-fuel prices at \u00a31,120, for example. Like-for-like comparisons may be imperfect, but we can say this: a widening gap can only increase the political pressure for intervention.",

      "body": "<p>Take your pick. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/07/uk-house-prices-slow-four-year-low-halifax\">House prices in the UK are rising at their slowest annual rate for four years, according to the Halifax\u2019s index</a>. Alternatively, June\u2019s increase was the strongest monthly increase this year.</p> <p>As ever with house prices, it\u2019s best to prefer the longer perspective. On this occasion, that means ignoring the June\u2019s very modest month-on-month pick-up of 0.4% and concentrating on the underlying trend. The mood is best captured by the fact that the May-July period recorded the fourth quarterly fall in a row, the first time that has happened since November 2012. In short, the market has slowed significantly this year. The annual rate of increase was 5.7% in January; now it is 2.1%.</p> <p>This should be seen as excellent news, even if estate agents and those seeking a quick sale of their property may disagree. Back in March last year, house prices were rising at an annual rate of 10%, which was completely unsustainable given how slowly wages are increasing. Indeed, the position was becoming dangerous, especially from the Bank of England\u2019s viewpoint. Double-digit house price inflation and rock-bottom interest rates make an unhealthy cocktail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/07/uk-house-prices-slow-four-year-low-halifax\">UK house price rises slow to four-year low, says Halifax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s too glib to say the referendum results turned the market. The vote for Brexit has been a factor, especially in London, but other forces are at work. The biggest is the sheer expense of houses relative to earnings. Average house prices remain about six times average earnings, a level last seen in 2007, just before the banking crash and recession.</p> <p>\u201cAffordability concerns\u201d, as the Halifax coyly puts it, are the reason why the current tepid conditions will probably continue for a while. The only obvious countering pressure is the shortage of homes on the market, which is at all-time low according to the lender. Overall, economists predict house price inflation of 2% this year, a forecast that may even prove to be on the high side.</p> <h2>Paddy Power Betfair takes a punt outside the industry</h2> <p>Breon Corcoran, chief executive of Paddy Power Betfair, is 46, which is young to choose to quit as a successful boss of a FTSE 100 company. Shareholders may also feel it\u2019s a bit early. Paddy Power and Betfair merged only 18 months ago and, after the initial enthusiastic applause, the share price has faded.</p> <p>If Corcoran longs for fresh adventures, which seems to be the case, it would be understandable. He\u2019s done 16 years in total at the two halves of the company. He quit as chief operating officer of Paddy Power in 2011 to lead a successful rehabilitation of Betfair. He then masterminded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/08/paddy-power-and-betfair-merger-agreed\">the \u00a35bn merger</a> with his old shop.</p> <p>\u201cThere is never a good time to leave,\u201d he says now. Shareholders would agree. From \u00a398 last August, the shares are \u00a375.50, down 370p on Monday, so he can\u2019t be said to be going out at the top in stock market terms. He, and the company, could argue that operations have been integrated faster than planned and profit forecasts this year look solid. Even so, the owners would probably prefer the full \u00a350m of promised savings to reach the bottom line before the architect of the deal departs.</p> <p>The replacement is Peter Jackson, 41, who, after a \u201crigorous and extensive\u201d global search, has found within the boardroom. He is one of the non-executive directors. Jackson fits the bill from the important technology angle. His background is in banking and currency exchange, plus a six-month stint as UK boss of Worldpay, the payments firm. But Jackson\u2019s experience in the gambling industry is confined to four years as a non-executive.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s sufficient training and there is, after all, no golden rule that bookies must appoint hardened bookmakers. All the same, you can understand why investors took fright. Paddy Power Betfair is the biggest online gambling firm in the world on some measures and its new jockey is a merely a promising newcomer.</p> <h2>Energy big six flowing against Ofgem current</h2> <p>The costs of supplying electricity are soaring, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/01/british-gas-hikes-electricity-prices-centrica-energy-bills\">British Gas told us last week when it lifted prices by 12.5%</a> \u2013 equivalent to \u00a376 on an average dual fuel bill. But what\u2019s this? Regulator Ofgem is moving in the opposite direction. It is cutting up to \u00a319 off bills for 3 million customers with pre-payment meters. Ofgem says costs have fallen since its \u201csafeguard\u201d tariff was introduced in February.</p> <p>In the tangled world of energy prices, half an explanation is possible. British Gas was looking back a few years, rather than a few months, when it was talking about costs. The company may also buy energy two years in advance, whereas Ofgem uses shorter horizons when doing its sums.</p> <p>All the same, the gap between the regulator\u2019s dual-fuel pre-payment tariff, which works out at \u00a31,048 for a typical customer, and the standard variable prices of the big six is starting to look wide. British Gas put its own dual-fuel prices at \u00a31,120, for example.</p> <p>Like-for-like comparisons may be imperfect, but we can say this: a widening gap can only increase the political pressure for intervention.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The re-emergence of nationalistic fringe parties such as One Nation caused many to wonder why, given our continued run without a recession, some areas of the country appear to have turned away from mainstream politics. One suggestion often referred to somewhat derisively as \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d argues that some areas \u2013 especially those outside the cities \u2013 have been left behind. However, a paper by the Grattan Institute pours cold water on this idea, arguing that the economic divide between Australia\u2019s cities and regions is not getting bigger. Clearly the economy of our nation has changed greatly over the past century \u2013 and even in the past few decades. While there has always been a large number of people working in services \u2013 from education and health through to retail trade and administration \u2013 in the past 30 years, the share of people working in services has risen from 69% to 79%. That is a difference of about 1.2 million people: The Grattan Institute\u2019s latest working paper, Regional patterns of Australia\u2019s economy and population, looks at the impact of these upheavals to see whether some of the increase in support for more protectionist and nationalistic parties and policies has been fuelled by economic factors that are hidden by general measures such as GDP and national unemployment rates. As the paper notes, these changes have geographic consequences. Its authors note that \u201cthe loss of agricultural and manufacturing jobs is felt most acutely in regional areas and on the city fringes\u201d \u2013 think, for example, about the loss of car manufacturers in Geelong, Elizabeth and Altona. The shift from agriculture, the decline of manufacturing and the mining boom that was mixed with an influx of income and people (much of which was transitory) has had many wondering if this upheaval and the fact that residents in regional areas feel they are being left behind has caused the increase in support for previously fringe parties. But, at first glance, it would appear this sense of \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d is either misplaced or overhyped as a reason for political change. The paper does find that there are often large disparities between the urban and regional sectors \u2013 average household incomes in regions, for example, is on average much less than in the capital cities. Measuring the average household income against distance from the GPO in each state there is a clear \u2013 if subtle \u2013 trend of lower income the further away from the GPO you get: And while all capital cities except Perth have pockets of low-income postcodes within 10km of the GPO, all as well see a higher tendency towards lower-income areas more on the fringes of the city. This is of course not unexpected \u2013 regional areas and outer suburbs have long been associated with lower incomes than in the \u201cinner cities\u201d. But this alone is not enough to explain increased support for the non-major political parties. And the problem for those arguing the cause of economic anxiety is that over the past decade incomes have grown at similar levels across all regions, and if anything have grown faster in the regions: Partly this can be explained by the mining boom but not all of it. The paper notes that average incomes growth rates \u201chave been similar between the city and regions in every state over the decade.\u201d There was some impact of the mining boom in Perth and Brisbane, however. Income grew strongly in all of Perth\u2019s and most of Brisbane\u2019s suburbs \u2013 fuelled by \u201cincreased corporate activity and high-income fly-in fly-out workers associated with the mining boom in the Pilbara and the Bowen Basin\u201d. By contrast, the paper found that in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide \u201cincome growth per person was highest in areas closest to the city centres and typically below average in suburban areas\u201d. But, in terms of inequality, it is the inner city areas that suffer the most. By comparing average with median incomes in postcodes the paper was able to look at inequality within small areas and it found that the regions are more likely to have lower levels of inequality: Again this is not too surprising \u2013 inner city postcodes often have a mix of very high-income earners and low-income social housing occupants, whereas regional areas are less likely to have the very high income earners. But once again the change in inequality over the past decade does not suggest there should have been a rise in \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d. The paper notes that inequality has risen slightly over past decade throughout Australia but \u201cit has generally increased a little more towards the centre of capital cities\u201d: Certainly this gives no reason for those in the regions to believe themselves being more left behind by the economy than those in the cities. And, on this measure, there was little difference across the states. The paper found that \u201cinequality increased more in areas closer to the CBD in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. In the other states, changes in inequality were similar in the cities and the regions.\u201d With regards to unemployment, the report found that there are likely to be higher level of unemployment in the remote areas \u2013 \u201cparticularly those with high Indigenous populations\u201d. Within cities, the report found that \u201careas of high unemployment tend to radiate out in lines from the CBD, separated by patches of low unemployment in neighbouring suburbs\u201d and the high unemployment areas tend to \u201cfollow the path of major roads, while adjacent less built-up areas have lower unemployment.\u201d But once again this in itself does not explain changes in political attitude. The report found that aside from the York Peninsula in South Australia, Gippsland in Victoria and around Townsville in Queensland, in the past five years \u201cunemployment has not got markedly better or worse in regions as opposed to cities\u201d. It would seem that economic aspects are not the main driver behind the growth of support for minor parties in the regions. But neither does immigration growth \u2013 often a key issue for such parties \u2013 explain the changes. The report found that most immigrants live in the cities and, while some go to mining areas, those from non-European, non-English speaking countries are much more likely to move to the cities than their European counterparts. The Grattan Institute paper is an important first step towards better understanding of the political forces currently at play in Australia. Future reports will compare voting choices with this mix of economic and social factors such as age and education attainment. But at first glance this initial report suggests those who seek to attribute the rise of populist and nationalist parties to economic anxiety in the regions are over-egging their case. There appears little change in the past decade of income, unemployment or inequality that would explain why regional areas might be more willing to embrace fringe parties than their city cousins.",

      "bodyText": "Britons have ditched the traditional two-week holiday in favour of shorter breaks as no-frills airlines have taken off over the last 20 years, according to official figures that also confirm the demise of the booze cruise. A review of travel trends since the mid-1990s by the Office for National Statistics highlighted a dramatic rise in the number of holidays taken by UK residents. In 2016, they went on more than 45m foreign holidays, up from 27m in 1996. That was a 68% increase, while the UK population rose by 12% in the same period. The ONS also found that seven- and 10-day holidays had become more popular than 14-day breaks. The types of holidays taken had also changed over those two decades, statisticians found. But there was little difference in Britons\u2019 top destinations. Spain and France remained the most popular, albeit with a dip in journeys to France. \u201cOne of the biggest changes we\u2019ve seen over the last 20 years is the marked decline in the popularity of two-week holidays and the rise of short breaks,\u201d the ONS said in a travel roundup released as many people head off for their summer breaks. \u201cThe week-long break is a lot more popular than before, and there\u2019s also been an increase in the number of holidays lasting 10 nights.\u201d One of the most likely explanations for UK residents going on more but shorter holidays was the growth of budget airlines, the ONS said. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, EU leaders relaxed the rules to create a common aviation area across Europe, allowing low-cost carriers such as easyJet and Ryanair to enter the market, it noted. Between 1996 and 2015 \u2013 the most recent figures available \u2013 passenger numbers at UK airports increased by 85%, from 135m to 251m. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said its figures also showed that cheaper flights and greater flexibility by travel companies had driven a shift away from the standard two-week break in the sun and a rise in shorter breaks. The group also highlighted a rise in city breaks thanks to the EU\u2019s Europe-wide \u201copen skies\u201d regulation. Commenting on the ONS figures, an Abta spokeswoman said: \u201cThese stats are a reflection of how far we have come in 20 years and how important it is that we keep similar agreements in place post-Brexit.\u201d The ONS travel roundup also highlighted a steep decline over the past two decades in people travelling abroad and returning the same day. There were more than 2m trips with no overnight stay in 1996 but only 363,000 last year. \u201cThis could be because many of these visits were booze cruises \u2013 journeys across the English Channel to stock up on alcohol and cigarettes \u2013 which are no longer as cost-efficient as they used to be,\u201d the ONS said. \u201cDuty-free sales within the EU ended in 1999, France has been ratcheting up the price of cigarettes since 2000, and in recent years the pound has fallen in value against the euro.\u201d While the general trend from 1996 to 2016 was a sharp rise in the number of holidays taken, the travel industry has faced tougher times since last summer\u2019s Brexit vote. The pound fell sharply after the referendum, making overseas holidays more expensive and prompting some Britons to opt for staycations. The pound dropped to a 10-month low against the euro of about \u20ac1.10 on Monday. The consultancy Deloitte said its latest research showed holiday spending had risen in the second quarter of this year from the first. But comparing consumer habits with a year ago showed the general pressures on household budgets from higher living costs. \u201cWhile spending on holidays was up quarter on quarter, the longer-term trend shows that it has fallen year on year,\u201d said Simon Oaten, a partner for hospitality and leisure at Deloitte. \u201cThese are the first signs of a weakening in consumer confidence with regards to their holiday spending, and it remains to be seen whether this proves to be a blip or the start of a prolonged slowdown that echoes what we have seen in other areas of the consumer market.\u201d Comparing the most popular holiday destinations in 1996 and 2016, the ONS report found Britons\u2019 love affair with Spain had bloomed, with the number of holidays taken there annually up by 87% in 20 years. France was one of the few countries that UK tourists were now visiting less than in 1996, with the number of holidays there down 9%. Seeking to explain the change, the ONS said: \u201cBudget airlines may be behind this too: rather than driving to France on a ferry (the number of holidaymakers travelling by sea has declined by 33% since 1996), tourists are perhaps opting for a cheap flight elsewhere instead.\u201d Germany joined the top 10 destinations for UK holidaymakers and another new entry was cruising, which was four times as popular as it was 20 years ago. \u201cThis could be due to an ageing population, with increasing numbers of older people in the population,\u201d the ONS said. Two destinations that dropped out of the top 10 since 1996 were Belgium and Turkey. Outside the top 10, places that had grown in popularity since the 1990s included the United Arab Emirates, thanks to a jump in trips to Dubai. There was also an increase in visits to Iceland, starting about 2010, the ONS said. \u201c2010 was also the year that the volcano Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull erupted, sending clouds of ash into the skies above Europe and grounding planes across the world, and some think that the TV pictures of Iceland shown around the globe encouraged visitors to go there,\u201d it added.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, after a quiet session, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has closed at a seven-week high. Mining stocks led the mini-rally, thanks to the jump in metal prices earlier today. The drop in the pound also helped exporters, but bookmaker Paddy Power shed around 5% after announcing its CEo was stepping down. The French market was flat, though, while Germany\u2019s DAX finished down 0.33%. Over in New York, the Dow Jones could be on track for its ninth record closing high in a row, after rising at the open. David Madden of CMC Market explains: The Dow Jones hit another record-high as the bullish sentiment is not showing any signs of slowing down. The US equity benchmark was on a roll last as it was racking up fresh record-highs, and the better-than-expected jobs report was the icing on the cake That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Rating agency Fitch has revised up its 2017 and 2018 world GDP growth forecasts. It now expects the global economy to grow by 3.0% this year, up from 2.9% in June, accelerating to 3.2% in 2018 (from 3.1%). Brian Coulton, Fitch\u2019s Chief Economist, says the global picture looks brighter: \u201cThe revisions are led by emerging markets and China in particular, whose recovery has been more pronounced than anticipated. But data continue to suggest a synchronised global expansion across both advanced and emerging market economies. Spill-overs from the rebound in emerging market demand are reflected in the fastest growth in world trade since 2010\u201d However.... Fitch is concerned that the UK economy is faltering, and expects further weakness as negotiations with Brussels intensify. It says: The slowdown in the UK since late 2016 was confirmed with the 2Q17 GDP release, revealing that growth remained subdued at 0.3%. Declining real incomes and a household saving ratio that is already at a 50 year low suggest that consumer spending will slow further. Brexit uncertainties will weigh heavily on investment this year and next. Over in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has crept up to another record high. The Dow ticked up to 20,092 points at the open, a small gain of just 4 points, but leaving it on track for its ninth record rise in a row. Splat! The pound has just hit a 10-month low against the euro, in a blow to any holidaymakers who haven\u2019t got their spending money sorted yet.... Sterling has fallen by 0.5% agains the euro to \u20ac1.1036, meaning one euro is now worth 90.6p. This has dragged the pound down to a five-month low against a basket of currencies.... The pound has been weak since the Bank of England decided not to raise interest rates last Thursday, and cuts its growth forecasts. Persistent worries over Brexit are also hitting sterling; today, the government has been denying reports that it could pay a \u20ac40bn bill to leave the EU. Global stock prices have crept up to a new alltime high today, as relief over last Friday\u2019s decent US jobs report lingers. Even in the age of budget airlines and cost-cutting, a pilot remains one of the \u2018Must Have\u2019 items for a successful flight. But maybe not for much longer? Swiss bank UBS have created a stir this morning, by predicting that dropping the pilot could save billions of pounds. But there\u2019s a snag; some passengers aren\u2019t prepared to step into a plane flown totally by computer, with no-one in the cockpit in case things go wrong. My colleague Patrick Collinson has the details: Pilotless planes would save airlines $35bn (\u00a327bn) a year and could lead to substantial fare cuts \u2013 if passengers were able to stomach the idea of remote-controlled flying, according to new research. Full-size cargo planes will be airborne without pilots by 2025, according to the report by the investment bank UBS, but it predicts it will take until the middle of the century before passengers have enough confidence to board pilotless planes. The savings for the airlines could be huge, UBS said. It estimated that pilots cost the industry $31bn a year, plus another $3bn in training, and that fully automated planes would fly more efficiently, saving another $1bn a year in fuel. More here: We\u2019ll have to wait longer than expected before discovering how Greece\u2019s economy fared in the last quarter. That\u2019s because Athens has decided to stop releasing \u2018flash\u2019 estimates of GDP, and is going to hold back until it has more comprehensive data. This follows some wild swings between the two releases -- last quarter, the flash estimate plunged Greece into recession, before updated data showed the economy was actually growing. That sort of thing might keep me amused, but it\u2019s not great for investors or economists as they try to make sense of the situation Reuters has the details: Greece\u2019s statistics service ELSTAT has suspended until further notice the release of flash quarterly estimates on the country\u2019s gross domestic product because of divergences with provisional estimates, an official at the statistics service said on Monday. The move means that flash data will not be issued on August 14. Nationwide quarterly GDP data will be released on September 1, taking into account more information than the early indicator of the flash estimate. That quarterly figure, known as provisional data, can also be subject to revisions over time. Greece\u2019s statistics office is under particular scrutiny right now, after its former chief was convicted of \u201cbreach of duty\u201d last week. Andreas Georgiou\u2019s crime? Officially, for failing to tell the statistics agency\u2019s board about the release of Greek fiscal data. Many experts, though, say Georgiou is paying the price for his efforts to improve Elstat, and making its data more reliable and accurate. As Yale professor Stathis Kalyvas puts it: Here\u2019s our news story about the UK house price slowdown: Germany\u2019s stock market is lagging behind the rest of Europe today, after this morning\u2019s surprise fall in industrial output. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has risen to a seven week high, though, and is not far from its record closing high of 7,547 points. Mining companies are driving the rally in London, after a jump in commodity prices overnight. Anglo American, Glencore, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton are all up over 1%, after Iron ore prices surged. Joshua Mahony of IG explains: New Chinese regulations over capacity curbs in the winter means that buyers are now pushing their demand forward somewhat, driving Chinese steel futures to their highest level in more than four years, while Iron Ore rose 7% overnight. Otherwise, the City is a little subdued. Foreign exchange markets are a particular snooze fest, with the pound hovering around $1.3050 Newsflash: Investor morale across the eurozone has dipped, as expectations for the future weaken. The Sentix investor confidence index dropped to 27.7 this month, down from 28.3 and slightly below expectations. Sentix, a market research firm, says that the eurozone economy seems to have peaked. Optimism in the US has dropped, while German sentiment has been hurt by the scandals in its car industry, it says. Jeremy Duncombe, director of the Legal &amp; General Mortgage Club, is concerned that UK house prices are still unaffordable for many people, despite the recent slowdown. \u201cYear-on-year house prices continue to creep upwards, in spite of political and economic headwinds. With prices still rising, first-time buyers are now on average having to save for over 11 years to save enough just for a deposit, and for those who are unable to save, they face staying in Generation Rent indefinitely. Jonathan Samuels, CEO of property lender, Octane Capital, says lack of housing supply is holding prices up. \u201cThe UK\u2019s property market is in a steady but decisive slowdown mode. Only the lack of properties for sale is preventing the market from deteriorating more quickly. While the jobs market is strong, buyers are increasingly feeling the pinch due to stubbornly high inflation and low wage growth. Squeezed finances will invariably see new house purchases put on the back burner. At the higher end of the market, stamp duty has put countless transactions to the sword.... Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, reckons the UK housing market is cooling, but nothing more serious: \u201cThe speed of price growth has slowed substantially, and at a national level average prices are still flatlining rather than falling. \u201cBut what growth there is is meandering and listless, with prices being propped up by record low levels of supply. \u201cOn the other side of the equation there is genuine buyer intent, and rumours that the government may review the Help to Buy scheme could add fuel to the fire as some hesitant buyers may be spurred into action by the idea of \u2018use it or lose it\u2019. Property expert Henry Prior has tweeted the key points from the Halifax report: Joshua Mahony of IG points out that house price growth has been weak for months; Economics journalist Dharshini David points out that prices are still rising faster than wages. Breaking! UK house prices growth has hit a four-year low. Halifax\u2019s monthly survey, just released, shows that prices in the three months to July were only 2.1% higher than a year ago. That\u2019s the weakest annual rate since April 2013, down from a blistering 10% back in March 2016. House prices in the last three months were 0.2% lower than in the previous three months (February-April). That\u2019s the fourth quarterly fall in a row, and another sign that the economy is slowing. In July alone, though, prices rose by 0.4% compared with June. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax Community Bank, says demand for houses is dropping as people are hit by rising inflation. \u201cHouse prices continue to remain broadly flat, as they have since the start of the year. Prices in the three months to July were marginally lower than in the preceding three months, while the annual rate of growth has edged down from 5.7% in January to 2.1% in July; the lowest rate since April 2013. \u201cThe rise in the employment level by 175,000 in the three months to May helped push the unemployment rate down to 4.5%, the lowest since June 1975. However, this improvement in the jobs market has not, as yet, boosted wage growth, resulting in earnings rising at a slower rate than consumer prices. This squeeze on spending power, together with the impact on property transactions of the stamp duty changes in 2016 now being realised, along with affordability concerns, appear to have contributed to weaker housing demand. More reaction to follow.... We also have worrying signs that British households are being squeezed again, as consumer spending falls again. My colleague Zoe Wood explains: Britons are slashing spending on new clothes, cars and foreign holidays, according to new figures that underscore the effect on consumer confidence of rising living costs and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Spending fell for a third consecutive month in July, according to Visa\u2019s consumer spending index, which it said was the longest-running slump since February 2013. The 0.8% year-on-year decline in July was worse than June\u2019s 0.2% drop, but not as steep as the fall of 0.9% in May. More here: One month\u2019s bad data doesn\u2019t equal a crisis. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Service points out that June\u2019s disappointment follows a \u201cvery robust run\u201d of growth this year. To suggest it marks a trend change would be extraordinarily premature, the more so given the post re-unification record high in the Ifo Business Climate. Holger Sandte of Nordea Markets also isn\u2019t panicking. Economist Carsten Brzeski of ING says we shouldn\u2019t be too alarmed by these figures. He writes: As unexpected as today\u2019s drop in industrial production has been, the German economy is still on track to post another strong quarter. Given the sound fundamentals, a month of weaker industrial data should only be like a rain shower on hot and humid summer day: a welcome refresher. [Frankly, some hot and humid days would be a welcome change for Britain right now...] But, Brzeski also warns that the ongoing scandals at Germany\u2019s car industry could hurt the economy: The automotive industry is currently in the middle of structural changes; partly self-inflicted and partly stemming from external factors. To some extent, the industry is in a similar situation as the banking sector. In Germany, the self-inflicted part goes back to the diesel emission scandal and the latest antitrust allegations, while at the same time possible bans of diesel bans in cities have emerged, international competition for electric vehicles has increased and phenomena like car sharing could also put pressure on future automobile productions. The 1.1% drop in German industrial output in June is \u2018not what the doctor ordered\u2019, says the Financial Times: It adds: Before today\u2019s figures, German factories had been enjoying five straight months of growing output, driven by a robust economic recovery in the eurozone, rising consumer confidence in the bloc, and a brightening world economy. German stats office Destatis said investment goods production contracted 1.9 per cent, while consumer output was down 0.7 per cent in June. Energy production was up on the month. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Germany has got the new week off to a disappointing start, reporting that factory output fell unexpectedly in June. It\u2019s the biggest decline this year. German industrial production fell by 1.1% during the month, dashing expectations of a 0.2% gain, and reversing May\u2019s 1.2% rise. The downturn was due to weaker construction output, as well as a dip in the production of intermediate, consumer and capital goods. This is the first decline this year, and potentially a sign that the powerhouse German economy is starting to lose momentum. But... this is only one month\u2019s figures, so not a reason to panic. Output is still up strongly over the last quarter, by around 1.8%, so this could just be a monthly blip. Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet shows how German output has been strong this year: I\u2019ll pull together more reaction now... Otherwise, the diary is a little quiet, apart from a new survey of UK house prices from Halifax and a regular update on eurozone confidence. European stock markets are expected to open higher, with the FTSE 100 called up around 20 points. The agenda: 8.30am BST: Halifax survey of UK house prices in July 9.30am BST: Eurozone investor confidence survey from Sentix",

      "bodyText": "Pilotless planes would save airlines $35bn (\u00a327bn) a year and could lead to substantial fare cuts \u2013 if passengers were able to stomach the idea of remote-controlled flying, according to new research. The savings for carriers could be huge, said investment bank UBS, even though it may take until the middle of the century for passengers to have enough confidence to board a pilotless plane. UBS estimated that pilots cost the industry $31bn a year, plus another $3bn in training, and that fully automated planes would fly more efficiently, saving another $1bn a year in fuel. Passengers could benefit from a reduction in ticket prices of about a tenth, the report said. \u201cThe average percentage of total cost and average benefit that could be passed onto passengers in price reduction for the US airlines is 11%,\u201d it said, although the savings in Europe would be less, at 4% on average but rising to 8% at Ryanair. Aircraft costs and fuel make up a much larger proportion of costs at airlines than pilot salaries, but UBS said profits at some major airlines could double if they switched to pilotless. More than half of the 8,000 people UBS surveyed, however, said they would refuse to travel in a pilotless plane, even if fares were cut. \u201cSome 54% of respondents said they were unlikely to take a pilotless flight, while only 17% said they would likely undertake a pilotless flight. Perhaps surprisingly, half of the respondents said that they would not buy the pilotless flight ticket even if it was cheaper,\u201d the report said. It added, however, that younger and more educated respondents were more willing to fly on a pilotless plane. \u201cThis bodes well for the technology as the population ages,\u201d it said. Industry experts predict intense passenger resistance to pilotless planes. Chris Tarry, an aviation expert, said: \u201cThis is such a long way into the future. It\u2019s going to be a very brave airline that takes its pilots off planes. What is a cutomer\u2019s number one concern? That they get you there safely. \u201cThere has been a lot of automation, and a number of landings at Heathrow are now on auto-land. But operating a drone is a very different thing to putting passengers on board and getting them off safely,\u201d he said. Drone technology has advanced rapidly in recent years, with all the major plane manufacturers testing fully-automated jetliners. Two weeks ago Airbus revealed that trials of its jet-engined Sagitta \u201cunmanned aerial vehicle\u201d had been successfully completed. In a seven-minute demonstration flight in South Africa, the \u201cunmanned jet-propelled demonstrator \u2026 flew completely autonomously \u2026 on a pre-programmed course,\u201d the company said in a statement. Boeing told reporters at the Paris airshow in June that it was testing pilotless aircraft in simulators and that artificial intelligence systems could replace many of the decisions currently taken by pilots. Commercial jets can already take off, cruise and land using computer technology, enabling planes to land at some airports even in foggy conditions. The number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped from three to two in recent years. Military technology is further advanced. The US navy managed to take off and land a fighter jet on an aircraft carrier in July 2013. UBS said one path toward pilotless aircraft will see airlines move to one pilot per plane. \u201cIn commercial flights, if the move from two to zero pilots may be too abrupt over the next 10 to 20 years, we could see first a move to having just one pilot in the cockpit and one remotely located on the ground, particularly on flights below six to seven hours [to be under pilots\u2019 fatigue]. Indeed, today\u2019s drones are controlled by remotely based operators.\u201d Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary said in 2010 that he would seek permission from authorities to fly with one person in the cockpit, saying the second pilot was only there to \u201cmake sure the first fella doesn\u2019t fall asleep and knock over one of the computer controls\u201d. UBS said cargo would be the first to go pilotless. \u201cUnlike passengers, cargo is not concerned with the status of its pilots [human or autonomous]. For this reason, pilotless cargo aircraft may happen more swiftly than for passengers. In addition, we believe that the 24-hour nature of much of cargo flights [often taking off or landing in the late and early hours] may be well suited to artificial pilots \u2013 with the problems of sleeping hours less of an issue.\u201d There are estimated to be about 20,000 commercial jet pilots in the UK, but in the medium term there in no threat to their jobs from pilotless aircraft. On the contrary, airlines\u2019 demand for pilots is soaring thanks to the rise of budget airlines and the huge increase in the number of commercial flights in Asia. \u201cThe real challenge for the industry right now is to train more pilots, not get rid of them,\u201d Tarry said.",

      "bodyText": "Pilotless passenger aircraft could save the industry, and airline passengers, $35bn (\u00a327bn) a year, according to investment bank UBS. However, there are a number of issues to deal with before pilot-free travel is possible, from negotiating with pilot unions to convincing regulators. Our Q&amp;A talks you through some of the concerns. Is the pilotless passenger plane a feasible concept? The use of commercial and military drones shows the technology for pilotless plane travel exists and is in regular use. The most common type of passenger aircraft in the world, which is planes made by Boeing and Airbus, rely heavily on computers that do much of the pilots\u2019 work. This form of flight is known as \u201cfly by wire\u201d. Meanwhile, auto-landing as well as conventional auto-pilot have been in place for decades. Control towers at airports are likely to become a thing of the past, with plans at London City airport to relay HD imagery to a site in Hampshire. Is fly by wire technology safe? Flying by airplane has never been safer thanks to considerable improvements in technology and design (and airport security). According to the International Air Transport Association, the airline industry trade body, there were 1.25 accidents per million jet flights last year \u2013 lower than the five-year average of 1.46 (which was already at a very low level). But the interaction between an automated system and a pilot can cause fatalities when it goes wrong and was a key factor in the Air France Flight 447 crash, which claimed 228 lives in 2009 and was the subject of an interesting Vanity Fair article. What are current regulations on pilotless passenger planes? The Civil Aviation Authority, the UK regulator, say there are no regulations in place for pilotless passenger planes because they do not exist, yet. \u201cAt the moment a passenger aircraft needs to be piloted by a human,\u201d it says, adding: \u201cThere are rules in place for large drones, the military style drones, which are pilotless and need to be certificated like other aircraft.\u201d What are the potential problems for pilotless planes? An unmanned cockpit \u2013 if pilotless planes have them \u2013 poses obvious security concerns, particularly if passenger planes retain the capacity for override by a human in case of computer glitches. This could be mitigated by having teams of pilots on the ground \u2013 similar to military drone pilots \u2013 who can take over at the first sign of trouble. There is also the situation of who is in charge of the plane when it is in the air and will have the authority to deal with unruly passengers and, for instance, decide to land the plane in an emergency situation. Would this power be conferred to senior cabin crew and if so, how would they command the plane to execute and emergency landing and how would they communicate with air traffic control? What do the pilots think? They are concerned about both flight safety as well as security.

However, there are a number of issues to deal with before pilot-free travel is possible, from negotiating with pilot unions to convincing regulators. Our Q&amp;A talks you through some of the concerns. </p> <h2><strong>Is the pilotless passenger plane a feasible concept? </strong></h2> <p>The use of commercial and military drones shows the technology for pilotless plane travel exists and is in regular use. The most common type of passenger aircraft in the world, which is planes made by Boeing and Airbus, rely heavily on computers that do much of the pilots\u2019 work. This form of flight is known as \u201cfly by wire\u201d. Meanwhile, auto-landing as well as conventional auto-pilot have been in place for decades. Control towers at airports are likely to become a thing of the past, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/19/remote-air-traffic-control-preparing-for-takeoff-at-london-city-airport\">plans at London City airport</a> to relay HD imagery to a site in Hampshire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/07/air-passengers-pilotless-planes-fares-ubs\">Air passengers wary of pilotless planes \u2013 even if they lead to lower fares</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Is fly by wire technology safe?</strong></h2> <p>Flying by airplane has never been safer thanks to considerable improvements in technology and design (and airport security). According to the International Air Transport Association, the airline industry trade body, there were 1.25 accidents per million jet flights last year \u2013 lower than the five-year average of 1.46 (which was already at a very low level). But the interaction between an automated system and a pilot can cause fatalities when it goes wrong and was a key factor in the Air France Flight 447 crash, which claimed 228 lives in 2009 and was the subject of an interesting <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2014/10/air-france-flight-447-crash\">Vanity Fair article</a>.<br><br></p> <h2><strong>What are current regulations on pilotless passenger planes?</strong></h2> <p>The Civil Aviation Authority, the UK regulator, say there are no regulations in place for pilotless passenger planes because they do not exist, yet. \u201cAt the moment a passenger aircraft needs to be piloted by a human,\u201d it says, adding: \u201cThere are rules in place for <a href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-industry/Aircraft/Unmanned-aircraft/Large-unmanned-aircraft/\">large drones,</a> the military style drones, which are pilotless and need to be certificated like other aircraft.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What are the potential problems for pilotless planes?</strong></h2> <p>An unmanned cockpit \u2013 if pilotless planes have them \u2013 poses obvious security concerns, particularly if passenger planes retain the capacity for override by a human in case of computer glitches. This could be mitigated by having teams of pilots on the ground \u2013 similar to military drone pilots \u2013 who can take over at the first sign of trouble. There is also the situation of who is in charge of the plane when it is in the air and will have the authority to deal with unruly passengers and, for instance, decide to land the plane in an emergency situation. Would this power be conferred to senior cabin crew and if so, how would they command the plane to execute and emergency landing and how would they communicate with air traffic control? </p> <h2><strong>What do the pilots think?</strong></h2> <p>They are concerned about both flight safety as well as security. Steve Landells, flight safety specialist for the British Airline Pilots Association, says: \u201cWe have concerns that in the excitement of this futuristic idea, some may be forgetting the reality of pilotless air travel. Automation in the cockpit is not a new thing \u2013 it already supports operations.

Economists at the Construction Products Association (CPA) see leaner times ahead for crane spotters as it predicts industry growth will drop to a six-year low ahead of Brexit. \u201cConstruction firms are still reporting that activity remains high and there are still lots of cranes around,\u201d said Noble Francis, the CPA\u2019s economics director. \u201cBut there are clear signs that construction output is slowing and that next year in particular will be difficult for the industry.\u201d The CPA, which represents manufacturers and distributors of construction materials, said the combination of a slowing economy, falling real wages and rising costs would hamper the industry\u2019s prospects in 2018. As a result its economists have lowered their growth forecast for next year from 1.2% to 0.7%, which would be the slowest in six years. Storm clouds may be gathering over the sector, but there is currently plenty of work for builders and the CPA actually increased its growth forecast for 2017 from 1.3% to 1.6%. The activity was explained by a sharp rise in social housing repair and maintenance contracts in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire. The construction industry would be reliant on major infrastructure projects such as HS2 and the Thames Tideway tunnel, as well as private housebuilding over the next two years, the CPA said, which would help to offset a sharp fall in the commercial and industrial sectors. The government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme has also underpinned housebuilding programmes with the policy due to run until 2021. Help to buy is expected to fuel growth in private housing starts of 3% in 2017 and 2% in 2018, the CPA said, but this is slower than in previous years given uncertainties about the strength of consumer confidence and falls in real earnings. Last week it was reported that help to buy could come to an end sooner, sparking a rout in housebuilders\u2019 share prices. The scheme enables buyers to purchase new-build homes worth up to \u00a3600,000 with a 5% deposit. Analysts at the stockbroker Jefferies said they doubted the policy would be altered before 2021, but added: \u201cIf potential changes were flagged ahead of this then housebuilders would have time, if needed, to adjust their site phasing and product mixes across their sites.\u201d Francis said more than a third of new housebuilding was sustained by help to buy with that trend expected to continue over the next 18 months, provided the wider economy and housing market did not slow further. \u201cDespite the slowdown in the general housing market, particularly in London, housebuilders continue to increase supply, albeit more slowly than in recent years,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, if economic conditions do deteriorate further, housebuilders can react quite quickly if necessary.\u201d The CPA has pencilled in growth of 1.8% for 2019 but says the unprecedented economic and political uncertainties Brexit and the recent general election have created mean \u201crisks around this forecast are considerable\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Annual house price growth has slowed to the lowest rate in four years, according to Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender. Despite the slowdown, Halifax, which is owned by Lloyds Banking Group, said house price growth was still underpinned by low mortgage rates and a shortage of homes for sale, which have countered falling household incomes. The average price of a home rose to \u00a3219,266 in July, up 0.4% from June. The monthly rise partially offset the 0.9% drop recorded in June, but prices were still down 0.2% in the last three months. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of price declines, the first time this has happened since November 2012. The annual rate is the lowest since April 2013, with house prices in the three months to July up 2.1% from a year earlier. Annual house price growth has declined from a peak of 10% in March 2016. Russell Galley, the managing director of Halifax Community Bank, said: \u201cHouse prices continue to remain broadly flat, as they have since the start of the year.\u201d He noted that rising employment levels had pushed the unemployment rate down to 4.5%, the lowest since 1975. \u201cHowever, this improvement in the jobs market has not, as yet, boosted wage growth, resulting in earnings rising at a slower rate than consumer prices,\u201d Galley added. \u201cThis squeeze on spending power, together with the impact on property transactions of the stamp duty changes in 2016 now being realised, along with affordability concerns, appear to have contributed to weaker housing demand.\u201d Experts point to the declining number of sales as evidence of a cooling market. They fell 3% between May and June to 96,910, the lowest level since October 2016, according to HMRC data. A rival house price index from Nationwide, the UK\u2019s biggest building society, painted a similar picture. It recorded a 0.3% monthly increase in July, while the annualised growth figure dropped to 2.9%. Nationwide reported monthly house price declines for March, April and May but June and July saw prices rise again. The housing market has surprised some economists with its resilience at a time of political uncertainty, rising inflation and stagnating or falling wages. Both Halifax and Nationwide say a lack of homes on the market will continue to support house prices in coming months. Halifax noted that new instructions for home sales fell for the 16th month in a row in June, with homes listed for sale at estate agents at an all-time low, citing data from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). Jonathan Hopper, the managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said the housing market was losing steam. \u201cThe speed of price growth has slowed substantially, and at a national level average prices are still flatlining rather than falling. But what growth there is is meandering and listless, with prices being propped up by record low levels of supply. \u201cOn the other side of the equation there is genuine buyer intent, and rumours that the government may review the help to buy scheme could add fuel to the fire as some hesitant buyers may be spurred into action by the idea of \u2018use it or lose it\u2019.\u201d Halifax said average house prices were still 10% above their peak in August 2007. Brian Murphy, the head of lending for the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said: \u201cHouse price growth is continuing in line with expectations, with independent industry bodies such as RICS forecasting annual house price growth of between 2% and 4% for 2017.\u201d Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cHouse prices look unlikely to rise by more than 2% over 2017. House prices could well be essentially flat over 2018.\u201d",
