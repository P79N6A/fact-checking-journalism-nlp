      "bodyText": "A division of the taxpayer-owned RBS bank which was meant to help companies in trouble mistreated many of its clients but did not try to \u201cprofit from their distress\u201d, according to a leaked report by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. According to the report, seen by the BBC, investigators found \u201cinappropriate action\u201d by Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was experienced by 92% of \u201cviable firms\u201d they dealt with. This included increasing interest rates and charges and imposing unnecessary fees on many of its clients, whose numbers peaked at 16,000. The GRG unit, which operated between 2005 and its closure in 2013, stepped in when companies which banked with RBS experienced financial difficulties. GRG, which was marketed by RBS as a turnaround specialist, has been accused of pushing some companies into bankruptcy so it could pick up their assets more cheaply. The leaked report found that struggling companies had a small chance of re-emerging in a healthy state, with only one in 10 returning intact to the main RBS bank. Almost seven out of 10 firms in turnaround remained tied to complex loans organised by the GRG which were often too expensive to leave. Other companies handled by the GRG ended up in administration, liquidation or sold. GRG was more like an \u201cundertaker\u201d than a recovery specialist, according to one BBC source. RBS provided only limited cooperation with the FCA inquiry it was claimed, although the bank said on Friday night that it cooperated fully. The FCA provided a summary of the findings last year but the full report calls for a fundamental review of how RBS handles small business customers in financial distress. RBS is facing scores of legal actions by former customers and has put aside almost \u00a3400m to compensate some of the small business owners alleged to have suffered at the hands of GRG but some campaigners claim that compensation payments could be closer to \u00a32bn. An FCA spokesman said many of the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated and its powers were therefore limited. The spokesman said the regulator \u201cwas investigating issues raised by the report which fall within our remit.\u201d The FCA would publish a full account of the issues contained in the report once the investigation was complete, he said. An RBS spokesman said it had already acknowledged that \u201cin some areas, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we could have done better for some customers in GRG \u2026 the bank accepts it did not always communicate as well or as clearly as it should have done and also did not always handle customer complaints well.\u201d It said it had taken appropriate FCA-approved measures to rectify the failings including a new complaints procedure and the automatic refund of complex fees paid by customers. RBS sources said the FCA had already made clear that in a \u201csignificant majority of cases\u201d it was unlikely that the actions of RBS \u201cdid not result in material financial distress to the customers it looked at\u201d. The bank, which is 73% owned by the state, claims the report used a \u201cvery broad\u201d definition of inappropriate treatment but still found GRG actions had a very limited impact on customers. Earlier this week, it reached an out-of-court settlement with businessman Stuart Wall who alleged his property company was forced into bankruptcy after involvement with the GRG. He was suing RBS for between \u00a3114m and \u00a3669m.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has been rebuked by the US central bank chief, Janet Yellen, for planning to scrap tough banking regulations that made the system \u201csubstantially safer\u201d and did nothing to restrict growth or lending. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chair, used a speech at the annual meeting of central bankers on Friday in the US ski resort of Jackson Hole to warn that policymakers might have forgotten the terrible damage wreaked on the global economy in 2008 when they seek to lift regulations that prevent risky behaviour. \u201cAlready, for some, memories of this experience may be fading \u2013 memories of just how costly the financial crisis was,\u201d she said. \u201cThe core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth.\u201d The president, who has vowed to \u201cdo a big number\u201d on the Dodd-Frank law at the centre of banker complaints, is backing calls from executives on Wall Street and Republicans in Congress for looser financial regulations to spur growth. In February, he said: \u201cI have so many people, friends of mine, that had nice businesses. They can\u2019t borrow money. They just can\u2019t get any money because the banks just won\u2019t let them borrow it, because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.\u201d The Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has said a sustainable growth rate above 3% a year can be achieved once banks are relieved of the shackles imposed on them by Dodd-Frank. In June, he proposed reducing the powers of the main consumer watchdog, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, weakening the Fed\u2019s oversight of large financial institutions and looser mortgage lending rules. The Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed in 2010 by the then president Barack Obama in response to the financial crisis. It brought in hundreds of new regulations including tougher consumer lending rules and the need for banks to hold bigger capital reserves. Yellen said: \u201cThe evidence shows that reforms since the crisis have made the financial system substantially safer. Reforms have boosted the resilience of the financial system. Banks are safer. \u201c[The changes] resulted in a return of lending growth and profitability among US banks. Material adverse effects of capital regulation on broader measures of lending are not readily apparent.\u201d Some changes to individual regulations may be warranted, Yellen said, and she mentioned the possible relaxation of the Volcker rule preventing banks from using their own funds to trade shares. A further relaxation of rules that apply to medium-sized and smaller banks could also be part of limited reforms. But overall, she said, \u201cany adjustment to the regulatory framework should be modest and preserve the increase in resilience\u201d in a financial system she said was now better able to weather future shocks. The speech in Wyoming could be Yellen\u2019s last as Fed chair. Her four-year term comes to an end next year and it is not clear whether Trump will reappoint her or she would want to continue in the role. Trump has already nominated a new Fed vice-chair of financial supervision, Randal Quarles, who has signalled an appetite to lessen the burden of regulation. There has been much speculation in Washington that a failure to renew Yellen\u2019s contract would be another step on the road to looser regulation. Most central bank watchers were keen to hear Yellen\u2019s views on the likely path of interest rates, but there was no mention of when the next increase may be or the debate raging inside the Fed over the path of rates in the next few years.",

      "bodyText": "Provident Financial, the troubled doorstep lender, has drafted in the former head of its consumer credit arm in a bid to stabilise the business after its debt collection rates plunged. The company said Chris Gillespie would replace Andy Parkinson as managing director of the business immediately. Gillespie ran the division, which charges high interest on loans collected mainly from borrowers\u2019 homes, from 2007 to 2013. Britain\u2019s biggest doorstep lender published a second profit warning in two months on Tuesday after a botched business overhaul caused debt repayments to fall heavily. Peter Crook, Provident\u2019s longstanding chief executive, quit abruptly and its main financial adviser said the consumer credit division was worthless. Provident grew rapidly in the years after the financial crisis, stepping in to offer credit to people turned away by banks that reined in lending. Its loans are expensive, with \u00a3100 borrowed from Provident over 13 weeks requiring a \u00a3143 repayment. Crook replaced Provident\u2019s 130-year-old army of self-employed collection agents this year with 2,500 full-time \u201ccustomer experience managers\u201d armed with tablet computers. But software problems created chaos in CEMs\u2019 schedules and caused collection rates to plummet. Provident is racing to fix its technical problems as competitors seek to lure unhappy employees and customers. It has brought in managers from elsewhere in the company to support Gillespie. On Tuesday, shares in Provident Financial suffered one of the biggest one-day losses seen by a FTSE 100 company, losing two-thirds of their value at one stage. On Friday, they were the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100, rising 17% to 874p. They have plunged from \u00a317.45 in the past week. Gillespie joined Albemarle &amp; Bond from Provident as chief executive but left after six months after the ailing pawnbroker was bought in a rescue deal. He then spent brief spells running two small lenders and his LinkedIn profile says he has been working as a consultant while looking for new opportunities. Manjit Wolstenholme, Provident\u2019s chairman, said Gillespie\u2019s job was to rebuild links with customers, revive collections and bring order to the business. Wolstenholme, who is running the company after Crook\u2019s departure, said: \u201cMy review of the business is ongoing as we move towards stabilising the Provident home credit business and improving the service to our customers. I intend to work closely with the new team on turning the home credit business around.\u201d Provident joined the FTSE 100 index of leading public companies in 2015 as investors impressed by its growth sent its market value rising. It looks likely to be ejected from the index next week after its market value fell by more than \u00a31bn in a week.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s banks are bracing themselves for a new wave of compensation claims likely to be sparked by a \u00a342m advertising campaign urging customers to complain about their payment protection insurance policies. The campaign by the Financial Conduct Authority is due to launch on 29 August \u2013 exactly two years before the cut-off point for any fresh PPI claims \u2013 and is being paid for by 18 of the biggest players in the industry. The FCA hopes the imposition of the deadline will help the industry draw a line under the scandal. It is by far the UK\u2019s costliest misselling scandal, having forced the industry to set aside more than \u00a343bn to handle the claims and pay compensation, according to calculations by the thinktank New City Agenda. The big four banks \u2013 Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 are sitting on \u00a36.5bn of funds to cover future claims. Lloyds said in its interim results this month that the unused \u00a32.6bn proportion of its \u00a318.1bn provision was \u201cconsistent with total expected complaint volumes of 5.3m, with approximately 1.2m still expected to be received, including approximately 9,000 reactive complaints per week through to August 2019\u201d. RBS, which is 71% owned by the taxpayer, has \u00a31.1bn it is yet to use, while HSBC has $1.1bn (\u00a3860m). Barclays has not used \u00a32.1bn out of the \u00a39.1bn it has set aside, which it describes as its \u201cbest estimate of expected PPI redress\u201d. In its interim results, Barclays also referred to the advertising campaign starting on 29 August and said its impact is \u201cuncertain but has been considered in Barclays\u2019 provision estimate\u201d. The sums also include the potential cost of administering the claims in a scandal that has cost far more than expected. Regulators initially estimated 3 million people might be affected, but four times that figure \u2013 12m \u2013 have so far received \u00a327.4bn in total, according to a tally compiled by the FCA. When Lloyds broke ranks with the industry in May 2011 and started to pay out claims, it set aside \u00a33.2bn which at the time it hoped would be sufficient to tackle the scandal. The bill for Lloyds alone now stands at \u00a318bn. Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, said the parts of the unutilised provisions were \u201can estimate of all future redress costs through to August 2019. Will that be enough? My guess is no, but almost enough.\u201d An extra \u00a31bn may be needed across the industry \u2013 but, he cautioned, \u201cmost of us have been wrong here many times before\u201d. Up to 60m policies were sold, the majority before 2005. While 12 million people have made claims, this could equate to between 20m to 24m policies as some customers had more than one. The FCA head, Andrew Bailey, justified the decision not to force banks to write to customers, instead putting the onus on customers. In a comment piece for the Mirror, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this would work. How many times have you ignored a generic letter through your door?\u201d Bailey added: \u201cMost of us see reminders every day of the PPI scandal from calls on our phone and adverts in newspapers. Yet there remain a large number of people who may be entitled to complain but have not yet made a complaint.\u201d Nick Baxter, independent chair of the Professional Financial Claims Association, said that the FCA data showing \u00a324.7bn had been paid out \u201cpresents the illustration of progress but we\u2019re only part way there\u201d. This is because the FCA\u2019s data does not separate out the interest customers receive from the premiums that are being repaid. About half the total payouts are thought to cover interest which, according to some industry estimates, could push the total misselling bill as high as \u00a3100bn. Claims management firms have been extremely active in touting for PPI business, often taking a large slice of any compensation they secure for customers. The National Audit Office estimated they have received as much as \u00a35bn. For some customers, the deadline represents a second opportunity to receive compensation: 1.2 million customers previously rejected are being told they may have other grounds for complaint. This is because of a crucial court ruling in 2014 \u2013 named after the Paragon customer Susan Plevin \u2013 that means customers can make claims for the commission they paid when the PPI was sold. The FCA has said compensation can be paid if the commission was 50% of the cost of the PPI. According to Moneysavingexpert.com more people could receive payments as commission was typically 67% of the value of the policy. Dominic Lindley, policy director at New City Agenda, warns that the deadline to make a claim will be earlier than April 2019 for 5.5 million individuals already contacted by their bank.",

    "webTitle": "Sterling and markets calm ahead of Jackson Hole bankers meeting - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Markets remain calm ahead of the Jackson Hole speeches from ECB boss Mario Draghi and US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. Most analysts expect the central bankers to be cautious about their comments, especially Draghi. Elsewhere there were more indications of the strength of the German economy, with second quarter GDP growth of 0.6%, although a key business sentiment index slipped slightly. But in the US, durable goods orders slumped in July. Meanwhile, the head of the White House\u2019s national economic council, Gary Cohn, has told the Financial Times he came under \u201cenormous pressure\u201d to quit his post after Donald Trump\u2019s Charlottesville comments but felt duty bound to carry on. He also suggested Trump would move forward with tax reforms next week. And with Hurricane Harvey heading for Texas, oil prices have moved higher on fears of disruption to production. On the markets the FTSE 100 is currently up 0.3% , Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.2% higher and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.13%. The pound is currently up 0.23% at $1.1.2828 and 0.13% better at \u20ac1.0864. With the recent pressure on the pound, there has been some talk it could reach parity with the euro, but ING thinks this is unlikely. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Keep an eye on the Business site for reports from Jackson Hole. Meanwhile, thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back next week. Commenting on the durable goods numbers, Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: The ever-volatile durable goods report delivered once again today, with figures showing a 6.8% decline in orders for July. Investors will be concerned on the back of today\u2019s results. Not only will support for the dollar dampen, the downbeat numbers will cast further shadows over the US growth outlook. US orders for durable goods - long lasting items such as cars and washing machines - fell by more than expected last month. They fell by 6.8% compared to a 6.4% rise in June and expectations of a 6% decline, according to the US Census Bureau. The fall is the biggest since 2014. All eyes may be on ECB president Mario Draghi and whatever comments he may or may not make at Jackson Hole about tapering its bond buying programme or the strength of the euro. But what action will the ECB actually take? Does the ECB even know what to do next? Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING says: When the ECB currently looks at the Eurozone, it sees a modest party with people enjoying themselves. The party is far from over but it could probably do with fewer QE drinks served by one of the hosts: Mario Draghi. In fact, serving less would come in handy as the drinks in Mario\u2019s fridge are running low. But how to tell the party guests? And how to do it without getting called out as a party pooper? In our view, the main arguments in favour of tapering are the successful defeat of the deflation risk, the strong economic recovery and bond scarcity. Tapering should be a cautious and very gradual withdrawal of some monetary stimulus, preferably without causing any tightening of financial conditions. Financial market reactions since the Sintra speech in June suggest that Mario Draghi and the ECB have lost some of their golden touch when it comes to guiding expectations. This has been partly driven by the fact that the ECB itself does not seem to be fully convinced what to do next and also by regularly changing its main messages. In our view, it seems most likely that the ECB would reduce the monthly purchases to \u20ac30bn in January, with an open end to the programme but at least until June 2018 and probably increasing the issuer limit and broadening maturities to grant itself maximum flexibility to scale back up once conditions warrant such a move. The Financial Times interview with Gary Cohn, head of the White House economic council, also contains positive news for those hoping for tax reforms. President Trump has been singularly unsuccessful so far in pushing through much of his agenda, and markets have almost given up on expected the long promised reforms. But Cohn said Trump will launch a major push on tax reform next week with a speech in Missouri. And this has helped the US market perk up. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The [US] index has already had a bit of good news this Friday. Trump\u2019s economic advisor has stated in an interview with the Financial Times that felt duty bound to stay on as part of the administration despite the President\u2019s failure to fully condemn the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, putting to bed rumours of his departure. Cohn went further, claiming that Trump will put tax reform back on the agenda next week with a speech in Missouri \u2013 no doubt a relief for investors desperate for a sign that the President will deliver on his market-lifting promises. Whether he can push through said reforms, however, is another matter entirely. In tandem with the European markets, Wall Street is expected to open marginally higher ahead of the Jackson Hole shindig. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to climb around 23 points or around 0.1% in early trading, while most European markets are currently around 0.3% higher. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: The Jackson Hole Symposium is widely regarded as one of the most notable annual events, not only because of the speakers it attracts but also because it has been used as a platform to warn of upcoming policy announcements. In the past it has been Janet Yellen\u2019s predecessors \u2013 Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke - that have delivered such warnings, the question today is whether she will do the same. The final months of the year are going to be very interesting as far as the Fed and the ECB are concerned which makes today\u2019s appearances from Fed Chair Yellen and ECB President Mario Draghi all the more interesting. Both central banks have started the process of tightening monetary policy, although the ECB would probably claim it\u2019s more a case of removing accommodation. Either way, with the process underway, investors are keen to know what they plan next. The Fed is already well underway with its rate hikes, having started almost two years ago and having raised three more times since (so four in total). With inflation still lagging well below target though, there is growing unease within the central bank about whether the current pace is appropriate. Investors have long been unsure that there\u2019ll be another rate hike this year and the message seems to finally be filtering through to the Fed. It will be interesting to see whether Yellen will address this today or instead focus on balance sheet reduction, which is expected to be announced in September and doesn\u2019t interest investors in the same way. The ECB is taking a far more cautious approach having dealt with a far more severe crisis for the last decade, one that the region is only just starting to truly recover from. The central bank announced one reduction on asset purchases last December and it\u2019s expected to announce another in the coming months. While investors are desperate to get more information on this, I think it\u2019s highly unlikely given the ECB\u2019s unease at past market reactions. I think the central bank will prefer to address this after the meeting next month on home turf and won\u2019t want to risk further tightening of financial conditions in the meantime, with the euro having already sharply appreciated this year. Over to the US, and there had been some concerns in recent days that Gary Cohn, the head of the White House national economic council, might step down in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s comments over the violence at Charlottesville. Markets certainly did not like the idea, given his crucial role and the number of executives who had already quit various government councils. Now in an interview with the Financial Times (\u00a3) Cohn said he had come under enormous pressure to resign but felt duty bound to carry on. But he said the current administration had to do more to condemn neo-Nazis and white supremacists. He told the FT: This administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities... As a Jewish American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting \u2018Jews will not replace us\u2019 to cause this Jew to leave his job. I feel deep empathy for all who have been targeted by these hate groups. We must all unite together against them. Markets are holding onto their gains, but investors are reluctant to commit themselves ahead of the key Jackson Hole speeches. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Indecision is rife across financial markets this morning, as the impending appearances from Mario Draghi and Janet Yellen mean that there remains little certainty over how this week is likely to close out. For the most part we are likely to hear Draghi reiterate his stance from earlier in the week, with ECB sources recently speculating that Draghi wouldn\u2019t announce any new policy shifts at today\u2019s speech. However, we could see Janet Yellen steal the headlines, with today marking her final Jackson Hole appearance before Donald Trump decides her future in February. But there is more activity in the oil market. Mahony said: Hurricane Harvey is bearing down upon the Gulf coast, with traders moving into crude oil given the potential for a massive disruption to a region which accounts for 45% of the nation\u2019s refining capacity and 17% of US output. With possibly the biggest storm in over a decade to hit American soil heading straight into the oil producing heartlands, there is the potential for huge disruption both at sea and inland. With three refineries already shutting down ahead of the storm, there is a significant chance that we will see a major disruption to the extraction and refining of crude oil and gasoline irrespective of any physical damage. The continuing strength of the German economy, as shown earlier by the GDP figures, has been reinforced by the latest business survey. Despite slipping slightly after six consecutive rises, the Ifo business climate index at 115.9 still met expectations. Clemens Fuest, resident of the ifo Institute, said: The ifo Business Climate Index edged downwards from 116.0 points last month to 115.9 points in August. But sentiment among German businesses remains very strong. The decline was due to slightly less positive assessments of the current business situation. Companies\u2019 short-term business outlook, by contrast, improved. Germany\u2019s economy remains on track for growth. Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said there was no signs of weakness in the German economy despite the dip in the Ifo index: The Ifo index dropped only marginally in August, confirming the almost breathtaking strength of the German economy. After six consecutive increases and three all-time highs in a row, Germany\u2019s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, just dropped for the first time. The drop, however, was only marginal and the Ifo now stands at 115.9, from 116.0 in July. Interestingly, the decrease was exclusively driven by the current assessment component. Expectations increased to 107.9, from 107.3 in July. It is almost pointless searching for macro-economic explanations for today\u2019s small drop. Of course, next to acrophobia, reasons for today\u2019s drop could be the strengthening of the euro over the last few months, fresh geopolitical concerns with the US-North Korean conflict and fading signs of any imminent investment boom in the US. However, the best explanation for the drop is simply a small technical correction after three record-highs in a row. All of this means that, unless German businesses are living in a kind of never-never land, today\u2019s Ifo index sends a clear signal that the German economy is powering ahead. What might look boring from the outside is clearly enjoyable from the inside. Jackson Hole is unlikely to provide much cause for market volatility, reckons the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Its European head of global markets research, Derek Halpenny, said: We see little reason for President Draghi choosing the Jackson Hole platform for a further update on the monetary policy outlook, but a comment on euro appreciation is more likely. The danger of Draghi not saying much of any substance today is that the markets will take it as a \u2018green light\u2019 for further euro buying. Although, with the ECB policy meeting not far from now we doubt the euro will advance much over the near-term. Of greater importance today is the speech by Fed Chair Yellen, as the probability of a funds rate hike in December has dropped to around 30% despite the economy running at a 1.9% growth rate in the first half of the year and now showing signs of a modest pick-up. Yellen\u2019s speech is on financial market stability and given the reference to asset valuations in the minutes from the July meeting, which Fed Staff concluded had increased from \u201cnotable to elevated\u201d, Chair Yellen may expand on this. Yellen may believe the markets need reminding that the Fed remains on course to raise the federal funds rate one further time this year. This would merely be a repeat of current Fed communication and hence is unlikely to prompt any major lift for the US dollar. The pound is holding fairly steady after a downbeat week dominated by Brexit worries, edging lower against the dollar but marginally higher against the euro. It is currently at \u00a21.2798, down 0.01%, and \u20ac1.0860, up 0.09%. In recent days it has been flirting with eight year lows against the single currency, with some talk of it falling to parity. But Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank, thinks this is unlikely: The pound has been an easy target for currency markets as the combination of a post-Brexit economic reality check and ongoing political anxiety has made the UK economy an outlier relative to its faster growing European peers. We believe this economic divergence story has largely run its course. In fact, the pound is beginning to show signs of idiosyncratic selling, similar to previous periods when domestic political risks have flared up. We make two points here. First, this tends to be a short-run phenomenon, with the pound\u2019s material undervaluation acting as a limiting factor for sustained weakness. Second, and more importantly, we would need to see an additional layer of bad news to fuel any further politically-induced GBP selling. This seems unlikely in the absence of a Brexit disaster situation unfolding - that is a complete breakdown in UK-EU negotiations and renewed cliff-edge risks. Political will from both sides suggests the worst-case scenario will be avoided. So while EUR/GBP has overshot our 0.90 forecast for the third quarter of 2017 - and admittedly quicker than we had anticipated - we cite four reasons for why we think a move towards parity looks unlikely at this stage. Our revised forecasts acknowledge the pound could remain under pressure ahead of key domestic and Brexit political risk events in October. But we view this as an overshoot of more fundamentally-justified levels, rather than a sustained trend in EUR/GBP towards parity. The four reasons are: The euro has become a \u2018political haven\u2019 for currency markets We had earmarked October as being a pivotal month for the pound regarding political risk events. The Tory Party Conference (1-4 October), the final round of opening Brexit talks (9 October) and EU summit (19-20 October) will give markets an opportunity to assess the progress made when it comes to the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. These event risks mean that it is understandable to see the pound markets trading with some apprehension. We have been warning of a potential \u2018sell on (PM) May and go away\u2019 type of behaviour emerging ahead of October. However, the extent of the pound\u2019s recent weakness - and deviation from short-term fundamentals - is now starting to look excessive relative to the near-term political risks at stake. This is certainly the case for EUR/GBP, which based on our estimates is trading around 4% above its short-term financial fair value. In contrast, GBP/USD is showing no visible signs of a UK-specific risk premium. We rationalise this as both UK and US political uncertainty offsetting each other in the near-term, making the euro the go-to \u2018political haven\u2019 in currency markets. How times have changed. Political will suggests a Brexit disaster can be avoided For the pound\u2019s politically-driven weakness to persist and extend all the way towards parity against the euro, we would argue that \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 risks would need to notch up another gear. In reality, the only way this could occur over the next six months is if we get a nightmare Brexit scenario in October - that is a complete breakdown of UK-EU negotiations. Instead, while we have previously acknowledged it is too early for the pound markets to price in any Brexit transitional deal hopes, we do think the growing consensus within Theresa May\u2019s cabinet over a transitional arrangement means that the tail risks of a cliff-edge Brexit are diminishing. The lack of clarity by the UK government on any preferred transition length - and rumours of only a 12 or 18-month arrangement being sought - may be seen as a near-term disappointment. Progress on securing a transition deal - with both sides providing strong assurances - should help to ease any significant pound downside bias. However, for this to serve as a catalyst for a rebound in the currency, we would need to see evidence that a reduction in economic uncertainty is in fact spurring a rebound in investment activity. This is what would give the Bank of England (BoE) greater confidence to begin normalising monetary policy - which would undoubtedly be a positive pound development. The pound is cheap, very cheap We see the pound as extremely undervalued, with the very stretched valuation likely putting a limit on the scale of further downside. EUR/GBP is rich by a staggering 20% based on our medium-term Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate valuation framework. Even if we control for the post 2015 rise in pound fair value due to improving UK terms of trade and declining UK government consumption, EUR/GBP would still be overvalued by 14%. When the medium-term valuation reaches such extreme levels, it tends to be difficult for the currency to weaken materially given the limits imposed by the underlying fundamentals. Markets have adjusted to a wait-and-see Bank of England stance The latest round of key UK economic data has put talks of a Bank of England rate hike on the back burner, with the breakdown of second quarter GDP highlighting the current weakness of the UK consumer. However, markets have now adjusted to a wait-and-see BoE policy stance and see limited risks of a flatter UK rate curve. For short-term domestic rates to move lower, we would need to see evidence of weak consumer activity turning into a hard-landing for the UK economy. Our economists see this as highly unlikely and are not expecting the economy to take a significant turn for the worst. We also believe EUR/GBP parity may not be in the economic interests of the BoE given the implications that further pound weakness has for imported inflation and the squeeze in real household incomes story. Equally, one could argue it is not in the economic interests of the ECB for financial markets to get ahead of themselves when it comes to pricing in the end of the central bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme. With implicit opposition from both sides, it\u2019s difficult to fundamentally justify any EUR/GBP move towards parity - certainly over the next three to six months. But Patel admits ING could be wrong about not hitting parity: Apart from one (or more) of our four assumptions turning out to be wrong, currency markets can sometimes be an untamed beast. Just because the pound is undervalued doesn\u2019t mean it should rally. There needs to be some positive catalysts for the pound to manifest, not least signs of a stabilisation in a slowing UK economy and greater progress towards a Brexit transition deal (even if not fully agreed). But certainly, the very negative psychology needs to be broken, such that the pound is not such a clear sell on rallies. Indeed we \u2013 and the BoE \u2013 are on the look-out for a \u2018sell UK\u2019 mentality developing, where the pound, gilts and equities all sell-off at the same time. This, however, has not been the case so far. If that mood was to develop, with pound weakness proving more trouble for the inflation trajectory, the IMF might recommend sharp rate hikes to break the vicious cycle. Typically that has been the prescription for significant 20% falls for the likes of the Russian ruble, Turkish lira and Brazilian real. Of course, the UK has had some painful experiences in using rate hikes to defend the pound (think 1992), and we very much doubt that the BoE would do that to support the currency. Yet, we believe, the bearish psychology on the pound still needs to be broken. Oil prices are climbing as Hurricane Harvey, potentially the biggest to hit the US in more than a decade, approaches Texas. Brent crude is up nearly 1% at $52.55 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 0.8% higher at \u00a247.83.on concerns about the disruption the storm could cause. Justin Chan at Numis said: Hurricane Harvey, a category-three storm, is expected to make landfall Friday night along the central coast of Texas where many refineries are located. The hurricane has continued to strengthen; if Harvey remains a category-three storm on landfall, it will be the strongest to hit the US since 2005. Energy companies have already shut coastal refineries and removed workers from offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Reuters reports, adding that nearly 10% of offshore Gulf crude output capacity had been halted by Thursday. Ahead of the main speeches at Jackson Hole, European stock markets have made a positive start to the day. The FTSE 100 is up 0.2%, Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.11%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.15% while Spain\u2019s Ibex is 0.2% better. There could be some fluctuations as the day progresses but some analysts believe investors will prefer to keep their powder dry. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: It\u2019s shaping up to be an uneventful trading session, at least until we get past speeches from Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi later this evening. Investors have used the Jackson Hole event as an excuse to go on \u201cpause\u201d despite numerous hints from various insiders that neither Yellen nor Draghi will say anything dramatic when it comes to monetary policy. This is especially true of the Federal Reserve chair... In other words, this year\u2019s symposium should see a return to the days when it was a dry and dusty academic event only of interest to economists. But even though Mr Draghi isn\u2019t expected to address the issue of the ECB\u2019s \u20ac60 billion per month bond purchase programme, some traders believe he may have something to say about the euro. This follows on from last week\u2019s release of minutes from the bank\u2019s last meeting which showed that the Governing Council were concerned about the current strength of the euro. Some traders feel that the ECB don\u2019t want to see the EURUSD get much above 1.2000 and will be listening out for anything that Mr Draghi may say on this matter. A revised second quarter growth figure for the German economy was in line with the initial estimates. The country - the economic powerhouse of the eurozone - saw GDP grow by 0.6% quarter on quarter and 0.8% year on year. Later comes the IFO business confidence index. Japan\u2019s inflation rate edged up by more than expected in August. The consumer price index rose from 0.1% in July to 0.5% year on year, compared to expectations of a 0.3% increase. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Improved inflation is good news for the Bank of Japan, even though the Japanese economy is still very far from the 2% inflation goal. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be looking to the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US for clues to the future of their various quantitative easing and bond buying programmes. In particular speeches by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will be scoured for clues on policy. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: After a long wait the Jackson Hole symposium finally kicked off yesterday, and traders will be paying close attention to the speeches from Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi, which are due to take place today... We were told by unnamed sources from the European Central Bank (ECB),that Mr Draghi will not be laying down the groundwork for the tapering of the stimulus package. The ECB chief will probably use the speech to congratulate himself on the recovery of the eurozone thanks to the loose monetary policy, but he might use the relatively low inflation rate as an excuse not to talk about reigning in the stimulus package. The ECB are buying \u20ac60 billion worth of government bonds per month, and traders know full well the central bank will run out of bonds to buy. The ECB will have to come up with alternative ways to keep the policy loose, because a weak euro will assist the eurozone. Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, is likely give us more of the usual, that the US economy is improving, and in particular unemployment is falling. Earnings could be firmer but they are edging higher. The US inflation level is below the Fed\u2019s target, and if Ms Yellen brings that up, it will tip off traders that we are unlikely to see a rate hike in December. Ahead of the speeches, markets look fairly calm. The Nikkei 225 is up 0.5% and the Hang Seng has added 1%. European markets are forecast to open slightly higher: On the foreign exchanges, the pound is holding steady against both the euro and the dollar. We have already had Japanese inflation - slightly higher than expected - and German GDP - in line with forecasts (more on those shortly). Otherwise the Jackson Hole meeting dominates the day.

But what action will the ECB actually take? Does the ECB even know what to do next? Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When the ECB currently looks at the Eurozone, it sees a modest party with people enjoying themselves. The party is far from over but it could probably do with fewer QE drinks served by one of the hosts: Mario Draghi. In fact, serving less would come in handy as the drinks in Mario\u2019s fridge are running low. But how to tell the party guests? And how to do it without getting called out as a party pooper?</p> <p>In our view, the main arguments in favour of tapering are the successful defeat of the deflation risk, the strong economic recovery and bond scarcity. Tapering should be a cautious and very gradual withdrawal of some monetary stimulus, preferably without causing any tightening of financial conditions.</p> <p>Financial market reactions since the Sintra speech in June suggest that Mario Draghi and the ECB have lost some of their golden touch when it comes to guiding expectations. This has been partly driven by the fact that the ECB itself does not seem to be fully convinced what to do next and also by regularly changing its main messages.</p> <p>In our view, it seems most likely that the ECB would reduce the monthly purchases to \u20ac30bn in January, with an open end to the programme but at least until June 2018 and probably increasing the issuer limit and broadening maturities to grant itself maximum flexibility to scale back up once conditions warrant such a move.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599ffdc8e4b009691a5a952e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-25T10:42:36.177Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Financial Times interview with Gary Cohn, head of the White House economic council, also contains <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0169006e-8946-11e7-bf50-e1c239b45787\">positive news for those hoping for tax reforms</a>.</p> <p>President Trump has been singularly unsuccessful so far in pushing through much of his agenda, and markets have almost given up on expected the long promised reforms.

Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Jackson Hole Symposium is widely regarded as one of the most notable annual events, not only because of the speakers it attracts but also because it has been used as a platform to warn of upcoming policy announcements. In the past it has been Janet Yellen\u2019s predecessors \u2013 Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke - that have delivered such warnings, the question today is whether she will do the same.</p> <p>The final months of the year are going to be very interesting as far as the Fed and the ECB are concerned which makes today\u2019s appearances from Fed Chair Yellen and ECB President Mario Draghi all the more interesting. Both central banks have started the process of tightening monetary policy, although the ECB would probably claim it\u2019s more a case of removing accommodation. Either way, with the process underway, investors are keen to know what they plan next.</p> <p>The Fed is already well underway with its rate hikes, having started almost two years ago and having raised three more times since (so four in total). With inflation still lagging well below target though, there is growing unease within the central bank about whether the current pace is appropriate. Investors have long been unsure that there\u2019ll be another rate hike this year and the message seems to finally be filtering through to the Fed. It will be interesting to see whether Yellen will address this today or instead focus on balance sheet reduction, which is expected to be announced in September and doesn\u2019t interest investors in the same way.</p> <p>The ECB is taking a far more cautious approach having dealt with a far more severe crisis for the last decade, one that the region is only just starting to truly recover from. The central bank announced one reduction on asset purchases last December and it\u2019s expected to announce another in the coming months. While investors are desperate to get more information on this, I think it\u2019s highly unlikely given the ECB\u2019s unease at past market reactions. I think the central bank will prefer to address this after the meeting next month on home turf and won\u2019t want to risk further tightening of financial conditions in the meantime, with the euro having already sharply appreciated this year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599ff4a2e4b0d26e26a9f45b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-25T10:10:39.137Z\">11.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cohn felt &quot;enormous pressure&quot; to quit White House</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over to the US, and there had been some concerns in recent days that Gary Cohn, the head of the White House national economic council, might step down in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s comments over the violence at Charlottesville. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/aug/18/markets-slide-on-trump-and-terror-concerns-business-live?page=with:block-5996ce4ce4b01c8820dfc45d#block-5996ce4ce4b01c8820dfc45d\">Markets certainly did not like the idea</a>, given his crucial role and the number of executives who had already quit various government councils.</p> <p>Now in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b85beea2-8924-11e7-bf50-e1c239b45787\">an interview with the Financial Times (\u00a3)</a> Cohn said he had come under enormous pressure to resign but felt duty bound to carry on.

Of course, next to acrophobia, reasons for today\u2019s drop could be the strengthening of the euro over the last few months, fresh geopolitical concerns with the US-North Korean conflict and fading signs of any imminent investment boom in the US.

In recent days it has been flirting with eight year lows against the single currency, with some talk of it falling to parity. But Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank, thinks this is unlikely:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound has been an easy target for currency markets as the combination of a post-Brexit economic reality check and ongoing political anxiety has made the UK economy an outlier relative to its faster growing European peers. We believe this economic divergence story has largely run its course. In fact, the pound is beginning to show signs of idiosyncratic selling, similar to previous periods when domestic political risks have flared up.</p> <p>We make two points here. First, this tends to be a short-run phenomenon, with the pound\u2019s material undervaluation acting as a limiting factor for sustained weakness. Second, and more importantly, we would need to see an additional layer of bad news to fuel any further politically-induced GBP selling. This seems unlikely in the absence of a Brexit disaster situation unfolding - that is a complete breakdown in UK-EU negotiations and renewed cliff-edge risks. Political will from both sides suggests the worst-case scenario will be avoided.</p> <p>So while EUR/GBP has overshot our 0.90 forecast for the third quarter of 2017 - and admittedly quicker than we had anticipated - we cite four reasons for why we think a move towards parity looks unlikely at this stage. Our revised forecasts acknowledge the pound could remain under pressure ahead of key domestic and Brexit political risk events in October. But we view this as an overshoot of more fundamentally-justified levels, rather than a sustained trend in EUR/GBP towards parity.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcd4abbd492713afbc58c122f8c08572455138b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcd4abbd492713afbc58c122f8c08572455138b8/129_0_2942_1765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"euro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The four reasons are:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong> The euro has become a \u2018political haven\u2019 for currency markets</strong></p> <p>We had earmarked October as being a pivotal month for the pound regarding political risk events. The Tory Party Conference (1-4 October), the final round of opening Brexit talks (9 October) and EU summit (19-20 October) will give markets an opportunity to assess the progress made when it comes to the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. These event risks mean that it is understandable to see the pound markets trading with some apprehension. We have been warning of a potential \u2018sell on (PM) May and go away\u2019 type of behaviour emerging ahead of October. </p> <p>However, the extent of the pound\u2019s recent weakness - and deviation from short-term fundamentals - is now starting to look excessive relative to the near-term political risks at stake. This is certainly the case for EUR/GBP, which based on our estimates is trading around 4% above its short-term financial fair value. In contrast, GBP/USD is showing no visible signs of a UK-specific risk premium. We rationalise this as both UK and US political uncertainty offsetting each other in the near-term, making the euro the go-to \u2018political haven\u2019 in currency markets. How times have changed.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>Political will suggests a Brexit disaster can be avoided</strong></p> <p>For the pound\u2019s politically-driven weakness to persist and extend all the way towards parity against the euro, we would argue that \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 risks would need to notch up another gear. In reality, the only way this could occur over the next six months is if we get a nightmare Brexit scenario in October - that is a complete breakdown of UK-EU negotiations.</p> <p>Instead, while we have previously acknowledged it is too early for the pound markets to price in any Brexit transitional deal hopes, we do think the growing consensus within Theresa May\u2019s cabinet over a transitional arrangement means that the tail risks of a cliff-edge Brexit are diminishing. The lack of clarity by the UK government on any preferred transition length - and rumours of only a 12 or 18-month arrangement being sought - may be seen as a near-term disappointment.</p> <p>Progress on securing a transition deal - with both sides providing strong assurances - should help to ease any significant pound downside bias. However, for this to serve as a catalyst for a rebound in the currency, we would need to see evidence that a reduction in economic uncertainty is in fact spurring a rebound in investment activity. This is what would give the Bank of England (BoE) greater confidence to begin normalising monetary policy - which would undoubtedly be a positive pound development.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>The pound is cheap, very cheap</strong></p> <p>We see the pound as extremely undervalued, with the very stretched valuation likely putting a limit on the scale of further downside. EUR/GBP is rich by a staggering 20% based on our medium-term Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate valuation framework. Even if we control for the post 2015 rise in pound fair value due to improving UK terms of trade and declining UK government consumption, EUR/GBP would still be overvalued by 14%. When the medium-term valuation reaches such extreme levels, it tends to be difficult for the currency to weaken materially given the limits imposed by the underlying fundamentals.</p> <p><strong>Markets have adjusted to a wait-and-see Bank of England stance</strong></p> <p>The latest round of key UK economic data has put talks of a Bank of England rate hike on the back burner, with the breakdown of second quarter GDP highlighting the current weakness of the UK consumer. However, markets have now adjusted to a wait-and-see BoE policy stance and see limited risks of a flatter UK rate curve. For short-term domestic rates to move lower, we would need to see evidence of weak consumer activity turning into a hard-landing for the UK economy. Our economists see this as highly unlikely and are not expecting the economy to take a significant turn for the worst.</p> <p>We also believe EUR/GBP parity may not be in the economic interests of the BoE given the implications that further pound weakness has for imported inflation and the squeeze in real household incomes story. Equally, one could argue it is not in the economic interests of the ECB for financial markets to get ahead of themselves when it comes to pricing in the end of the central bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme. With implicit opposition from both sides, it\u2019s difficult to fundamentally justify any EUR/GBP move towards parity - certainly over the next three to six months.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Patel admits ING could be wrong about not hitting parity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apart from one (or more) of our four assumptions turning out to be wrong, currency markets can sometimes be an untamed beast. Just because the pound is undervalued doesn\u2019t mean it should rally. There needs to be some positive catalysts for the pound to manifest, not least signs of a stabilisation in a slowing UK economy and greater progress towards a Brexit transition deal (even if not fully agreed). But certainly, the very negative psychology needs to be broken, such that the pound is not such a clear sell on rallies. Indeed we \u2013 and the BoE \u2013 are on the look-out for a \u2018sell UK\u2019 mentality developing, where the pound, gilts and equities all sell-off at the same time. This, however, has not been the case so far.</p> <p>If that mood was to develop, with pound weakness proving more trouble for the inflation trajectory, the IMF might recommend sharp rate hikes to break the vicious cycle. Typically that has been the prescription for significant 20% falls for the likes of the Russian ruble, Turkish lira and Brazilian real. Of course, the UK has had some painful experiences in using rate hikes to defend the pound (think 1992), and we very much doubt that the BoE would do that to support the currency. Yet, we believe, the bearish psychology on the pound still needs to be broken.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599fcdd0e4b0d26e26a9f3d5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-25T07:18:57.557Z\">8.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Oil climbs as Hurricane Harvey approaches Texas</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oil prices are climbing as Hurricane Harvey, potentially the biggest to hit the US in more than a decade, approaches Texas.</p> <p>Brent crude is up nearly 1% at $52.55 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 0.8% higher at \u00a247.83.on concerns about the disruption the storm could cause.

In particular speeches by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will be scoured for clues on policy. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After a long wait the Jackson Hole symposium finally kicked off yesterday, and traders will be paying close attention to the speeches from Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi, which are due to take place today...</p> <p> We were told by unnamed sources from the European Central Bank (ECB),that Mr Draghi will not be laying down the groundwork for the tapering of the stimulus package. The ECB chief will probably use the speech to congratulate himself on the recovery of the eurozone thanks to the loose monetary policy, but he might use the relatively low inflation rate as an excuse not to talk about reigning in the stimulus package.</p> <p>The ECB are buying \u20ac60 billion worth of government bonds per month, and traders know full well the central bank will run out of bonds to buy. The ECB will have to come up with alternative ways to keep the policy loose, because a weak euro will assist the eurozone. </p> <p>Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, is likely give us more of the usual, that the US economy is improving, and in particular unemployment is falling. Earnings could be firmer but they are edging higher. The US inflation level is below the Fed\u2019s target, and if Ms Yellen brings that up, it will tip off traders that we are unlikely to see a rate hike in December.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ahead of the speeches, markets look fairly calm.

Arcadia, which owned BHS until it was sold to a consortium led by Dominic Chappell for \u00a31 in 2015, on Friday agreed the deal with BHS\u2019s liquidators, FRP Advisory, which will drop legal action filed against Green\u2019s company. A spokesman for FRP said: \u201cThe liquidators of SHB Realisations, formerly BHS, reached an agreement with Arcadia Group in relation to a number of matters, including Arcadia\u2019s floating charge dated 14 April 2015. \u201cWe can confirm that as part of the agreement, over \u00a330m was released from reserves held in relation to Arcadia\u2019s secured claim into the monies available for BHS unsecured creditors and the floating charge is to be released.\u201d The settlement avoids the prospect of the retail billionaire fighting a lengthy legal battle over the demise of BHS. Green avoided another legal battle with the pension regulator by agreeing to pay \u00a3363m to rescue the BHS pension scheme. Chappell is to be prosecuted by the pensions watchdog for failing to provide information for an investigation into its sale. Chappell headed Retail Acquisitions, the company that acquired BHS. A year later, it collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of \u00a3571m. The Pensions Regulator is prosecuting Chappell for failing to comply with three notices for information issued under section 72 of the Pensions Act 2004. Failure to provide such information without a reasonable excuse is a criminal offence that can result in a fine.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 6pm and the Lion &amp; Antelope is rammed. Every seat is taken, every table filled with booze, and every bartender serves a never-ending stream of punters eager for a teatime pint \u2013 or three. But this isn\u2019t your everyday pub: this is Manchester airport\u2019s Terminal 3 in August, the pre-drinking place to be for holidaymakers heading to Alicante, Ibiza, Malaga, Dublin and Faro. For Kay Ashley, 19, the departure lounge is a \u201cgreat place to start\u201d her night out in Ibiza. \u201cWhen you get there, you\u2019ve drank; you\u2019re ready to go to your hotel, put your bags down, get ready and go out,\u201d she said, ahead of a late-night Ryanair flight to the Balearic party island. Ashley is among millions of passengers who enjoy a pre-flight tipple on their summer getaway \u2013 and many of them will be filling bars in terminals this bank holiday. But this month airlines called time on irresponsible drinking after the BBC\u2019s Panorama showed hair-raising footage of drunken debauchery at 35,000ft. Ryanair, Europe\u2019s biggest short-haul airline, called on airports to limit alcohol sales to two drinks per person and ban drinking in terminals before 10am. It followed a similar move by rival Jet2, which last year stopped serving alcohol on early-morning flights. Ryanair\u2019s tough stance came as figures showed a significant rise in arrests for alcohol-related unruliness in the air. Police made 387 arrests at airports and on planes last year, the BBC found, up from 255 in 2015-16. Meanwhile the Civil Aviation Authority \u2013 the industry regulator \u2013 reported a 600% increase in disruptive passenger incidents in the UK between 2012 and 2016, mostly alcohol-related. Beleaguered cabin crew members also voiced concerns, saying some flights to Ibiza, Alicante and Palma had turned into \u201cnightclubs in the sky\u201d. A survey by trade union Unite of more than 4,000 cabin crew workers found that 87% had witnessed drunken passengers. More than half said they had been verbally abused by inebriated passengers and more than a quarter said they had seen behaviour that threatened flight safety. If the findings raised concerns about alcohol-related trouble in the sky, it was little in evidence on a weekday night this month at the Lion &amp; Antelope, where thirsty punters could buy supersize cocktail pitchers called Vodbulls \u2013 a potent mix of Absolut Vodka and Red Bull \u2013 alongside beers, wines, shots and spirits. Ashley, from north Wales, said Ryanair\u2019s proposed crackdown would \u201cruin the holiday\u201d and her friends vowed to boycott the airline if it was introduced. \u201cIt\u2019s bollocks,\u201d said Nicola Percy, 19. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to go on a night out and we can only have two drinks. Unless you\u2019re being rowdy there\u2019s no need [for a crackdown].\u201d Concerns were also raised this month over the sale of duty-free alcohol. Figures showed that more than half of all disturbances involved alcohol bought and brought on to planes before departure. A code of conduct introduced last year in an attempt to combat antisocial behaviour by passengers appears to be having little effect, according to Unite\u2019s survey of cabin crew. Airlines have urged ministers to make it a criminal offence for passengers to drink any alcohol not bought on board the aircraft. How much airports are profiting from alcohol sales, as Ryanair claims, is debatable. The call for a crackdown will be noted with some cynicism at airports who have long seen Ryanair asencouraging more passenger expenditure aboard their planes rather than in shops or restaurants on the ground. The harder bargains that the big low-cost carriers have struck on landing charges \u2013 a fee levied per passenger \u2013 have made competing airports search ever harder for alternative income. Airports need to generate more income from parking or retail in order to hold down landing charges \u2013 a fee levied per passenger \u2013 and stop airlines from going elsewhere. An airport insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cIf you stop airports selling alcohol then they\u2019ve got to make that back somewhere else. We have teams of people asking passengers what they want: they consistently say we want more shops, better restaurants. Those bars are certainly busy all the time. It\u2019s what people want.\u201d A well-lubricated passenger might conceivably be freer-spending too. At Manchester airport, about 55% of the \u00a3395m it took in revenues last year came from landing charges, leaving it to make about \u00a37.50 per passenger from elsewhere, roughly an even split between car parking and its shops and restaurants. How much booze contributes isn\u2019t made public. Airport bars are exempt from the 2003 Licensing Act, meaning they can open at whatever hours they please. Measures now put in place include airport-wide warnings at Glasgow to bars and airline staff about any passengers identified as over-indulging. Police at Manchester airport employ a football-style yellow and red card scheme warning airline gate staff of potential miscreants, while posters abound warning passengers that drunkenness may mean they are not allowed on board. . In Manchester airport\u2019s duty-free lounge, large signs advertised 20% off the high-street price of 1l bottles of gins, vodka, whisky and Jagermeister. Two A5-size notices advised passengers not to open duty-free alcohol before departure but they were vastly outnumbered by posters advertising \u201cgreat offers\u201d on alcohol. At the checkout, one World Duty Free employee said: \u201cErm, not sure\u201d, when asked whether passengers they were allowed to drink duty-free alcohol on board. A colleague then advised one passenger: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can any more\u201d and produced a yellow notice that read: \u201cPassengers are advised not to open/consume alcoholic drinks purchased in duty-free before departure.\u201d A WDF spokesperson said: \u201cWorld Duty Free has been, and continues to be, proactive in developing and implementing initiatives to address the social issue of disruptive passenger behaviour. Our retail staff are trained on procedures to follow when selling alcohol products and retrained every three months to ensure they are clear on these policies.\u201d Ryanair announced this month that passengers flying from Manchester and Glasgow Prestwick to Alicante and Ibiza were no longer permitted to take duty-free alcohol on board, believed to be the first ban of its kind by an airline in Britain. But on Ryanair\u2019s 8.10pm flight to Ibiza from Manchester on a weekday evening this month, the rule did not appear to be strictly enforced. A Guardian reporter was allowed on board with four alcohol miniatures despite being searched at the departure gate, while a number of other passengers with hand luggage were let on the plane without searches. Sarah Blake, who was flying to Ibiza to celebrate her friend\u2019s 50th birthday, said the warnings about taking alcohol on board were futile: \u201cThey didn\u2019t even check my bag. Imagine if they searched everyone\u2019s bag, it would take another two hours to board.\u201d Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer, said: \u201cThis regulation is enforced on our behalf by security contractors at Manchester airport and those who are attempting to conceal alcohol may be denied travel and we have asked them to ensure our policies are enforced correctly.\u201d In the Lion &amp; Antelope, Faye Pritchard, 25, said her friends\u2019 approach to airports was simple: \u201cGet as many in as you can.\u201d Her friend, Daniel Ferguson, 24, said a limit on drinks per passenger would simply encourage people to smuggle duty-free alcohol on board. \u201cThink how many [alcohol-related] incidents there are compared with how many people come through an airport in a day,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a couple of idiots who can\u2019t handle their ale, I don\u2019t think you should punish the whole airport.\u201d",

Unless you\u2019re being rowdy there\u2019s no need [for a crackdown].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"916059f8355331266502583d622953ccdf4b25dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/916059f8355331266502583d622953ccdf4b25dc/0_243_5519_3310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A duty free shop at Manchester airport Terminal 3.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A duty free shop at Manchester airport Terminal 3.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Concerns were also raised this month over the sale of duty-free alcohol. Figures showed that more than half of all disturbances involved alcohol bought and brought on to planes before departure. A code of conduct introduced last year in an attempt to combat antisocial behaviour by passengers appears to be having little effect, according to Unite\u2019s survey of cabin crew. Airlines have urged ministers to make it a criminal offence for passengers to drink any alcohol not bought on board the aircraft.</p> <p>How much airports are profiting from alcohol sales, as Ryanair claims, is debatable. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/14/ryanair-calls-airports-crackdown-alcohol-sales-drunk-passengers\">call for a crackdown</a> will be noted with some cynicism at airports who have long seen Ryanair asencouraging more passenger expenditure aboard their planes rather than in shops or restaurants on the ground. <br></p> <p>The harder bargains that the big low-cost carriers have struck on landing charges \u2013 a fee levied per passenger \u2013 have made competing airports search ever harder for alternative income. Airports need to generate more income from parking or retail in order to hold down landing charges \u2013 a fee levied per passenger \u2013 and stop airlines from going elsewhere. </p> <p>An airport insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cIf you stop airports selling alcohol then they\u2019ve got to make that back somewhere else. We have teams of people asking passengers what they want: they consistently say we want more shops, better restaurants. Those bars are certainly busy all the time. It\u2019s what people want.\u201d</p> <p>A well-lubricated passenger might conceivably be freer-spending too. At Manchester airport, about 55% of the \u00a3395m it took in revenues last year came from landing charges, leaving it to make about \u00a37.50 per passenger from elsewhere, roughly an even split between car parking and its shops and restaurants. How much booze contributes isn\u2019t made public. Airport bars are exempt from the 2003 Licensing Act, meaning they can open at whatever hours they please.</p> <p>Measures now put in place include airport-wide warnings at Glasgow to bars and airline staff about any passengers identified as over-indulging. Police at Manchester airport employ a football-style yellow and red card scheme warning airline gate staff of potential miscreants, while posters abound warning passengers that drunkenness may mean they are not allowed on board. .</p> <p>In Manchester airport\u2019s duty-free lounge, large signs advertised 20% off the high-street price of 1l bottles of gins, vodka, whisky and Jagermeister. Two A5-size notices advised passengers not to open duty-free alcohol before departure but they were vastly outnumbered by posters advertising \u201cgreat offers\u201d on alcohol. At the checkout, one World Duty Free employee said: \u201cErm, not sure\u201d, when asked whether passengers they were allowed to drink duty-free alcohol on board. A colleague then advised one passenger: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can any more\u201d and produced a yellow notice that read: \u201cPassengers are advised not to open/consume alcoholic drinks purchased in duty-free before departure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70d1cc39f7f7daf169163d8a8f7a59c041e5a3c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70d1cc39f7f7daf169163d8a8f7a59c041e5a3c7/0_0_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"World Duty Free said it trained staff on procedures on selling alcohol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">World Duty Free said it trained staff on procedures on selling alcohol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A WDF spokesperson said: \u201cWorld Duty Free has been, and continues to be, proactive in developing and implementing initiatives to address the social issue of disruptive passenger behaviour. Our retail staff are trained on procedures to follow when selling alcohol products and retrained every three months to ensure they are clear on these policies.\u201d</p> <p>Ryanair announced this month that passengers flying from Manchester and Glasgow Prestwick to Alicante and Ibiza were no longer permitted to take duty-free alcohol on board, believed to be the first ban of its kind by an airline in Britain. But on Ryanair\u2019s 8.10pm flight to Ibiza from Manchester on a weekday evening this month, the rule did not appear to be strictly enforced. A Guardian reporter was allowed on board with four alcohol miniatures despite being searched at the departure gate, while a number of other passengers with hand luggage were let on the plane without searches.</p> <p>Sarah Blake, who was flying to Ibiza to celebrate her friend\u2019s 50th birthday, said the warnings about taking alcohol on board were futile: \u201cThey didn\u2019t even check my bag. Imagine if they searched everyone\u2019s bag, it would take another two hours to board.\u201d<br></p> <p>Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer, said: \u201cThis regulation is enforced on our behalf by security contractors at Manchester airport and those who are attempting to conceal alcohol may be denied travel and we have asked them to ensure our policies are enforced correctly.\u201d</p> <p>In the Lion &amp; Antelope, Faye Pritchard, 25, said her friends\u2019 approach to airports was simple: \u201cGet as many in as you can.\u201d</p> <p>Her friend, Daniel Ferguson, 24, said a limit on drinks per passenger would simply encourage people to smuggle duty-free alcohol on board. \u201cThink how many [alcohol-related] incidents there are compared with how many people come through an airport in a day,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cFor a couple of idiots who can\u2019t handle their ale, I don\u2019t think you should punish the whole airport.\u201d\u00ad</p>",

      "bodyText": "A mine expansion proposal by Glencore appears to include handing responsibility for the McArthur River Mine site to the Northern Territory government just 50-100 years into an expected 1,000-year rehabilitation and monitoring process. Glencore is proposing to expand its operations in Borroloola for another 20 years from 2018 and, according to its draft environmental impact statement, that expansion would require up to 300 years of rehabilitation and management, and about 900 years of monitoring. But a risk assessment table deep within the document indicates Glencore intends to have little or no involvement after the mine\u2019s life ends and the \u201cadaptive and reactive management phases\u201d begin in 2048. According to the table, Glencore\u2019s new plan reduced the risk that \u201clong-term closure monitoring cannot be achieved\u201d. However, its confidence that the risk would be reduced was \u201coutside McArthur River Mining\u2019s control\u201d, suggesting another entity \u2013 likely the NT government \u2013 may have to take over the responsibility. Glencore\u2019s current proposal for expansion would have the mine continue operating until 2037, with reprocessing bringing an end to the life of the mine by 2048. It would then enter the closure phase, including \u201cadaptive management\u201d until 2100 to rehabilitate the site to a permanent, self-sustaining state with no need for active management. From 2101 until 3017 the \u201cproactive monitoring and reactive monitoring\u201d phases would see scheduled routine monitoring and maintenance transition to a system of responding only to particular events. The EIS defines \u201clong-term\u201d to be 100-1000 years after closure, including the proactive and reactive monitoring phases, but the document item about the company\u2019s control also references a funding agreement with regulators for the \u201cadaptive\u201d phase. This phase begins much earlier, in 2048, and includes the controversial rediversion of the McArthur river to flow through a refilled pit lake. The Environmental Defenders Office NT said its experts had raised major queries about the \u201csense and safety\u201d of the flow through option over backfilling the pit. The risk assessment said there was funding for only 25 years of monitoring but early monitoring and feedback would \u201ccontinually update closure costs and reduce the risk of unforeseen major costs\u201d. The McArthur River Mine has seen a number of environmental incidents including the combustion and year-long smouldering of its waste rock pile \u2013 which it is also seeking to expand. Locals have also repeatedly raised concerns over contamination findings in the river and fish stock. Guardian Australia asked Glencore whether it intended to relinquish all responsibility in 2048, what the cited \u201cfunding mechanisms\u201d were, what level of involvement the company would have in any future incident responses and if it was proposing to receive its \u2013 as yet undisclosed \u2013 rehabilitation bond back from the government. The company did not answer specific questions but a spokeswoman said it was continuing to engage with stakeholders including the NT government and the EPA on the content of the draft EIS, as it developed its supplementary report. A public comment period on the draft EIS closed in May and Glencore are now in the process of drafting a responsive supplementary EIS. A spokeswoman for the NT Department of Primary Industry and Resources declined to comment on specific elements while the process was ongoing. The NT environmental protection agency similarly declined to comment on Glencore\u2019s EIS before the draft supplement was completed. However, its chairman, Paul Vogel, said it wasn\u2019t unusual for a mining company to hand over control and responsibility for a mine site to a government once the ore body ran out or ceased to be economically viable. \u201cWhat needs to be agreed with government and other stakeholders, should their proposal be approved, is under what conditions or relinquishment criteria would that hand back occur and what is the process for that to happen over the ensuing years,\u201d he said. Dr Gavin Mudd, associate professor at RMIT and chairman of the Mineral Policies Institute, suggested it was difficult to predict how Glencore\u2019s rehabilitation plans would play out, partly because they had taken a unprecedented and welcome step of modelling for 1,000 years but also because very few mines in the NT had ever properly been closed. \u201cOften what does happen in the industry \u2026 if you\u2019re looking at gold or coal in particular, the lease is just held on to and switched from \u2018operation\u2019 to \u2018care and maintenance\u2019 and a new operator will come along and reopen it all,\u201d he said. Regardless, relinquishing responsibility in 2048 was \u201cabsolutely\u201d too soon, Mudd said, although the mining industry would likely consider it reasonable. There were serious questions around what happens should there be an incident in the future and how it would be funded. \u201cThe waste rock dump is up to 300 degrees celsius,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely incredible \u2026 Anyone with a brain would realise that means huge, long-term environmental risk, and financial risk. \u201cWe know the very nature of these types of problems. They can last for 1000 years.\u201d The Garawa elder Jack Green recently won a legal battle to have the bond amount publicly disclosed but Glencore are appealing the ruling. In 2015 Glencore agreed to increase its bond \u2013 then known to be $111m \u2013 after the then Country Liberal party government threatened to shut it down. The new amount was not published but previous estimates have said as much as $1bn could be required to properly clean up the site after Glencore left. The Northern Territory government holds $1.3bn in total rehabilitation bonds for all NT mine sites, according to the Australia Institute.",
