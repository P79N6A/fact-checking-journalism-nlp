Millions of people who visit the UK\u2019s travelling funfairs will also have a wider choice of rides and attractions on their doorstep if the Competition and Markets Authority accepts the new rules from fairground operators. The CMA complained in December that a 128-year-old set of carnival rules drawn up by the funfair trade body, the Showmen\u2019s Guild of Great Britain, was out of date and stifling competition. But on Tuesday the CMA said the guild had offered to make changes to its rules to address the anti-competitive issues it had raised. A series of legally binding commitments by the guild mean that individual ride operators are longer guaranteed a spot at a funfair if they have provided a poor service or a bad ride, and can be replaced by new ride providers. In addition, under the proposed rules going out to consultation, it will be easier to join the guild and offer amusements at the 7,000 fairs its members hold in the UK every year. The competition watchdog said the guild, which represents 90% of the UK\u2019s travelling fairs and has about 2,000 members, had rules that stop funfair owners from competing with one another to organise or attend fairs. The guild rules also prevented members from starting fairs that might compete with existing funfairs, it warned. As a result, visitors to fairs were potentially missing out on improvements arising from greater competition, such as new rides and amusements, new fairs or different kinds of fairs in their local vicinity. It also made it difficult for local authorities to change or improve a fair. The CMA estimates that the fairground market is worth \u00a3100m in the UK and claimed the existing guild rules could mean funfair goers are subjected to higher prices. The guild says there there are about 200 funfairs every week in the UK between Easter and Bonfire night, with the most popular attracting more than half a million fairgoers. But in cases where local authorities try to alter or improve a fair without the consent of the guild, its members can boycott the event. That happened in Newcastle upon Tyne in 2013 which meant the popular Hoppings fair did not go ahead, disappointing the 500,000 fairgoers who usually attend. \u201cWe welcome the guild\u2019s offer to make changes to its rules and are now consulting on whether others agree that they meet our competition concerns,\u201d said Ann Pope, a senior CMA director. \u201cWe believe that the current restrictions hinder change and innovation in funfairs. The new rules will enable more competition in travelling fairs potentially giving the millions of fairgoers who attend them every year access to new rides and to different fairs in their local area.\u201d The Showmen\u2019s Guild of Great Britain declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Provident Financial has lost two-thirds of its stock market value in a day, after the doorstep lender was hit by a \u201cquadruple whammy\u201d of body blows. The company, which specialises in lending to people in financial difficulty, issued its second profit warning in two months, parted company with its chief executive and cancelled a dividend for shareholders. It also announced that it is facing a regulatory probe by City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority into the sale of a product that allowed people to freeze their credit card debt. The perfect storm of bad news for investors sent shares in the sub-prime lender plummeting more than 66%, from more than \u00a317 to 589.5p, wiping nearly \u00a31.7bn off its stock market value. The rapid deterioration in Provident\u2019s performance, less than two years after it entered the FTSE 100, comes after a botched attempt to overhaul its 130-year-old business model by cutting staff numbers and ramping up its use of technology. Its chief executive, Peter Crook, who earned \u00a36.3m in pay and bonuses last year, stepped down with immediate effect, with Manjit Wolstenholme becoming executive chairman. Provident, which downgraded forecasts for its consumer credit division to a profit of \u00a360m two months ago, now expects the business to suffer losses of up to \u00a3120m in the current financial year. The company will cancel its interim dividend \u2013 and \u201cin all likelihood\u201d the full-year payout in a bid an attempt to conserve cash, in a move analysts said could save about \u00a3200m. Provident grew rapidly in the years after the financial crisis, stepping in to offer credit to people who could not secure it from banks, as they became more wary of risky lending. Interest rates on such loans are typically high, with \u00a3100 borrowed from Provident over 13 weeks incurring a repayment of \u00a3143. The division has about \u00a3500m out on loan. Earlier this year it announced changes to its traditional business model of sending self-employed sales agents door to door, offering loans and collecting debts. In a move to embrace automation, Crook unveiled plans to do away with its 4,500 sales agents. It replaced them with 2,500 full-time \u201ccustomer experience managers\u201d, who would be connected to head office via iPads, their time managed more efficiently thanks to analytical software. The result has been a fall in its debt collection rates from 90% last year to just 57%. Analyst Stuart Duncan of Peel Hunt said: \u201cThey\u2019ve taken a model which was centuries old and have pretty much broken it.\u201d In a statement to the stock market, Provident said the software had \u201cpresented some early issues\u201d. Wolstenholme said this was partly down to the wrong schedules and routes being used, which meant staff ended up visiting when borrowers were not home. She added that some of the \u201ccustomer experience managers\u201d were underperforming but that it was too early to say how. \u201cI\u2019ve got to work out why the hell that\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. She insisted that Provident would not abandon the strategy of employing full-time staff, which she said would make it easier to comply with regulations in the long term. But she conceded that the software used to direct those staff might have to be \u201ctweaked\u201d. \u201cWe seem to have lost something along the way in trying to be a bit too automated about it,\u201d she added. \u201cWe had a good business and we need to make sure we get back there.\u201d The company also admitted that its Vanquis Bank division is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority over the sale of repayment option plans (ROP), a product that helps people freeze credit card debt. The investigation relates to sales made between April 2014 and April 2016. Provident has agreed to suspend the sale of ROPs, which were worth \u00a370m a year in revenues. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets called the string of negative announcements a \u201cquadruple whammy\u201d as Provident\u2019s share price nosedived. Peel Hunt\u2019s Stuart Duncan said the company did not seem to be in imminent danger of collapse, but warned it could face problems if Vanquis Bank customers start withdrawing deposits. \u201cIf they read that Provident or Vanquis is in trouble, it will be interesting to see how the deposit base behaves over the next few years.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Southern rail trials wheel clamping scheme in station car parks", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Southern rail is to further test the patience of passengers after months of industrial action and disruption to services by trialling a new vehicle clamping regime in seven station car parks. Clamping will be tested from September at busy commuter stations in Surrey including Redhill, Dorking and Leatherhead to target \u201cpersistent offenders\u201d who refuse to pay car park fees and subsequent fines. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union accused Southern of using clamping to generate extra revenue, while the AA and Transport Focus warned it was a backward step that risked the return of \u201cthe scourge\u201d of clamping. The RMT has been in dispute with Southern rail for more than a year over the future of conductors or guards, with further strike action set for 1 and 4 September. The clamping pilot scheme comes alongside the introduction of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) at 25 stations operated by Southern\u2019s parent company, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR). The new cameras will identify and capture the number plate of a vehicle when it enters and exits the car park before calculating the likely payment. The operator said the number plate recognition system meant motorists no longer need to walk back to their car to display a ticket and can even catch a train and pay later online. Mick Cash, the RMT general secretary, said: \u201cSouthern is a company that has declared all-out war on its staff and passengers alike and RMT is not surprised at anything this mob will do to extract the maximum profits out of their government contract. They would charge the public for breathing the air on their trains if they thought they could get away with it.\u201d The AA pointed out that wheel clamping on private land was outlawed in 2012, although an exception was made at railway stations, which means it is theoretically still permissible under bylaws. \u201cTo see the scourge of wheel clamping appear again seems a very backward step,\u201d said an AA spokesman. \u201cMotorists had a traumatic enough time when car park clamping was rampant and any return to that practice in car parks will go down very badly. Issuing a parking ticket to selfish drivers who disregard restrictions and chasing up the fine is now a well-established system ... That should be good enough.\u201d Anthony Smith, the chief executive of Transport Focus, added: \u201cClamping is a blunt, crude and potentially very unfair response to this problem. It is not allowed on other private land so why should private train companies be different?\u201d Karl McCormack, business development manager at GTR, said: \u201cWe thank the vast majority of our passengers who adhere to the parking terms and conditions, but we have to address those individuals who frequently evade payment. We don\u2019t want to clamp a single car, but if we have to we will use the money recovered to invest further in our station parking.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Southern rail is to further test the patience of passengers after months of industrial action and disruption to services by trialling a new vehicle clamping regime in seven station car parks.</p> <p>Clamping will be tested from September at busy commuter stations in Surrey including Redhill, Dorking and Leatherhead to target \u201cpersistent offenders\u201d who refuse to pay car park fees and subsequent fines. </p> <p>The Rail, Maritime and Transport union accused Southern of using clamping to generate extra revenue, while <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jul/15/pay-display-parking-meters-dont-take-new-1-pound-coin-machines-not-converted\">the AA</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.transportfocus.org.uk/\">Transport Focus</a> warned it was a backward step that risked the return of \u201cthe scourge\u201d of clamping. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/rmt\">RMT</a> has been in dispute with Southern rail for more than a year over the future of conductors or guards, with further strike action set for 1 and 4 September.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The clamping pilot scheme comes alongside the introduction of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) at 25 stations operated by Southern\u2019s parent company, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR).</p> <p>The new cameras will identify and capture the number plate of a vehicle when it enters and exits the car park before calculating the likely payment. The operator said the number plate recognition system meant motorists no longer need to walk back to their car to display a ticket and can even catch a train and pay later online. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Mick Cash, the RMT general secretary, said: \u201cSouthern is a company that has declared all-out war on its staff and passengers alike and RMT is not surprised at anything this mob will do to extract the maximum profits out of their government contract. They would charge the public for breathing the air on their trains if they thought they could get away with it.\u201d </p> <p>The AA pointed out that wheel clamping on private land was outlawed in 2012, although an exception was made at railway stations, which means it is theoretically still permissible under bylaws. </p> <p>\u201cTo see the scourge of wheel clamping appear again seems a very backward step,\u201d said an AA spokesman. \u201cMotorists had a traumatic enough time when car park clamping was rampant and any return to that practice in car parks will go down very badly. Issuing a parking ticket to selfish drivers who disregard restrictions and chasing up the fine is now a well-established system ... That should be good enough.\u201d </p> <p>Anthony Smith, the chief executive of Transport Focus, added: \u201cClamping is a blunt, crude and potentially very unfair response to this problem. It is not allowed on other private land so why should private train companies be different?\u201d</p> <p>Karl McCormack, business development manager at GTR, said: \u201cWe thank the vast majority of our passengers who adhere to the parking terms and conditions, but we have to address those individuals who frequently evade payment. We don\u2019t want to clamp a single car, but if we have to we will use the money recovered to invest further in our station parking.\u201d</p>",

Chappell headed Retail Acquisitions, the company that acquired BHS for \u00a31 from Sir Philip Green in 2015. A year later, it collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of as much as \u00a3571m. The Pensions Regulator is prosecuting Chappell for failing to comply with three notices for information issued under section 72 of the Pensions Act 2004. Failure to provide such information without a reasonable excuse is a criminal offence that can result in a fine. Chappell has been summonsed to appear at Brighton magistrates court on 20 September to face three charges of neglecting or refusing to provide information and documents without a reasonable excuse. Keir Greenaway, national officer for the GMB union which represented some BHS staff, said: \u201cIt\u2019s about time the Pensions Regulator realised it does have teeth and starts using them to protect the interests of working people. \u201cGMB hopes today\u2019s decision by the Pensions Regulator to step up is not just motivated by the profile of this case but a sign of things to come.\u201d Green owned BHS for 15 years until he sold it to Chappell, a former bankrupt with no retail experience. Retail Acquisitions received payments of up to \u00a325m from BHS despite owning the department store chain for just 13 months until it collapsed. The regulator has already agreed a \u00a3363m cash settlement with Green to rescue the BHS pension scheme and halted legal proceedings against the billionaire. However, it is understood to be seeking as much as \u00a317m from Chappell and Retail Acquisitions in relation to the scheme. Chappell was sent a formal warning notice by the regulator in November in which it made clear it was using its legal powers to seek funds towards filling the BHS pension deficit and ongoing support of the scheme. He had six months to reply and set out his case after which a determinations panel, independent of the investigations team, should decide whether he has to make a contribution and how much it should be. But the regulator has been unable to access information it requires about the BHS sale process in order to determine the anti-avoidance measures against Chappell, leading to the legal case to be heard next month. The former bankrupt has previously pledged to fight that legal action, saying the black hole in the scheme was not his fault. Frank Field MP, who led a parliamentary inquiry into the demise of BHS, said: \u201cAct two was a long time coming and this play will get more exciting as it goes on. There are many further acts to be played before full justice is gained for the 11,000 people who lost their jobs and so that pensioners can rejoice.\u201d Pensions experts have warned that a legal battle about the BHS scheme could take years. Although the regulator can legally force Chappell to make a payment, he can take an appeal against such a decision to the supreme court.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On a busy day, UK public finances showed a surprise surplus of \u00a3184m in July, compared to forecasts of a \u00a31bn deficit. The number was boosted by higher than expected tax receipts. Meanwhile the latest CBI industrial trends survey brought positive news on manufacturing orders and exports. In Germany, however, there was a surprise drop in economic sentiment. On the foreign exchanges, the pound continues to weaken, thanks to Brexit concerns and a revival in the dollar. On the corporate front, Provident Financial saw its shares slump after the UK lender issued another profit warning, bade farewell to its chief executive, abandoned its dividend and revealed an investigation by regulators into its Vanquis Bank. Elsewhere the Pensions Regulator said it would prosecute Dominic Chappell for failing to provide documents it requested during its investigation into the sale of BHS. Stock markets have regained some poise, with the FTSE 100 up 0.8% despite the collapse in Provident Financial\u2019s shares. Germany\u2019s Dax is currently 1% higher while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.75%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back bright and early tomorrow. Despite the surprise surplus in July, the UK\u2019s public finances will take time to sort out, says Larry Elliott: The government was in the happy \u2013 and unusual \u2013 position of being in the black in July. To the surprise of the City, tax receipts were higher than public spending. Not by much, but a surplus is still a surplus even if in the context of a \u00a31.8tn economy it is small change. This, though, was a classic case of one swallow not making a summer. For a start, the deficit in the first four months of the financial year \u2013 a much better guide to the trend than a single month\u2019s figures \u2013 was higher this year than last. Moreover, despite strong growth in employment, PAYE receipts last month were only 1.6% higher than in July 2016. That is entirely consistent with an economy where workers struggling to secure a decent pay rise are not paying very much tax. The first July surplus since 2002 was an improvement on a small \u00a3400m deficit in July 2016 but close examination of the Office for National Statistics data suggests that was the result of an \u00a3800m jump in receipts from self-employment. But as a number of analysts pointed out, in 2016 the deadline for the self-employed fell on a weekend, with the result that many payments were not processed until August. To judge whether there has been any real improvement in self-employment receipts we will have to wait for the August data to come out. Larry\u2019s full analysis is here: Here\u2019s Lord Macpherson \u2013 who on Monday described QE as \u201clike heroin\u201d \u2013 on the public finances: Brexit concerns are outweighing the positive public finance figures as far as the pound is concerned, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: The first July surplus meant little to the pound this Tuesday, which wilted in the face of a resurgent dollar. With little news on the key US fronts \u2013 North Korea, the status of economic advisor Gary Cohn \u2013 the greenback saw no reason to not to rebound, climbing half a percent against both the pound and the euro. It wasn\u2019t all due to dollar strength, however. Sterling suffered from a renewal of the semi-persistent Brexit fears, while the euro was hurt not only by a weaker than forecast pair of German and Eurozone ZEW economic sentiment readings but further doubt that Mario Draghi will say anything to boost the currency at the Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday. The eurozone ZEW economic sentiment survey showed a fall from 35.6 to 29.3 in August. Back with the UK public finances, and Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, says they could give chancellor Philip Hammond some leeaway in his forthcoming budget : A welcome summer break for the chancellor as the public finances saw the first July surplus since 2002. Specifically, there was a marginal repayment of \u00a3184m on public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks (PSNBex) in July. This compared to a shortfall of \u00a3308m in July 2016. June\u2019s shortfall was also revised down to \u00a36.2bn from a previously reported \u00a36.9bn. Even so, June\u2019s shortfall was up markedly from \u00a34.8bn a year earlier - partly due to a major payment to the EU budget as well as higher debt interest payments. Completing a hat-trick of good news, the 2016/17 budget shortfall was trimmed again to \u00a345.1bn from \u00a346.2bn. The public finances particularly benefited in July from a 10.6% year-on-year (y/y) rise in self-assessed income tax receipts, which ties in with the resilience of the labour market... If the pattern of the first four months were repeated over the full fiscal year, 2017/18 public borrowing would come in at \u00a349.2bn. This would be well below the shortfall of \u00a358.3bn forecast by the ONS in March\u2019s Budget. While a struggling economy and higher interest debt payments look likely to weigh down on the public finances over the coming months, there\u2019s a good chance that the chancellor will have a little wiggle room in November\u2019s Budget. Rising dissatisfaction with austerity and the public sector pay cap is exerting pressure on the government to recalibrate fiscal policy in November\u2019s Budget. However, it currently seems most likely that there will be limited adjustments to the fiscal approach rather than radical policy changes. While the chancellor has indicated that he has taken on board the views of the electorate, he has stated that he remains committed to the fiscal rules set out at the Autumn Statement which lead to a balanced budget by mid-2020\u2019s. More on the pound. Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com, said: Sentiment towards the British pound remains negative and so if the dollar were to stage a more meaningful comeback then the GBP/USD would be the one to watch as it could drop heavily. The pound is currently down 0.6% at $1.2824. Manufacturers expect strong growth in the next three months after a pick up in orders in August, according to the CBI\u2019s latest industrial trends survey. The survey showed 30% of manufacturers reported order books above normal, with 17% saying they were below normal. The balance of +13% was higher than the +10% level seen in July and above the long run average of -14%. As for exports, 22% of firms said they were above normal and 10% below. Anna Leach, CBI Head of Economic Intelligence, said: There are further signs that exporters are feeling the benefit from the lower pound in this month\u2019s figures, and output growth is expected to power on over the coming quarter. But she added: After a brief pause last month, expectations for selling prices have rebounded, indicating that the squeeze on consumers is set to persist. We expect CPI (Consumer Price Index) to top out at around 3% towards the end of this year and remain close to that level during 2018, as the effect of the weak pound continues to feed through. Here\u2019s our story on the UK public finances. Richard Partington writes: The government ran the first July budget surplus in more than a decade last month, as Britain\u2019s public finances recorded an unexpected leap back into the black with help from an increase in self-assessed tax payments. Public sector net borrowing last month, excluding the nationalised banks, was in surplus by \u00a3184m, the first surplus in that month since 2002, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Tuesday. City economists had expected the government to record a \u00a31bn deficit. Receipts from self-assessed income tax increased by \u00a3800m to \u00a38bn last month, compared with July 2016, giving the government the highest level of July self-assessed tax receipts since it started recording these payments in 1999. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said the figures were a welcome boost for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who now had a \u201cvery decent chance\u201d of undershooting his 2017-18 fiscal target. The full story is here: BREAKING: The Pensions Regulator has announced it will prosecute Dominic Chappell over its investigation into BHS. The full statement from the regulator reads: The Pensions Regulator (TPR) is to prosecute Dominic Chappell for failing to provide information and documents it requested during its investigation into the sale of BHS. Mr Chappell was the director and majority shareholder of Retail Acquisitions Ltd at the time that the company purchased BHS. TPR is prosecuting Mr Chappell for failing to comply with three notices issued under Section 72 of the Pensions Act 2004. The notices requiring information were issued to Mr Chappell on 26 April 2016, 13 May 2016 and 20 February 2017. He has been summonsed to appear at Brighton Magistrates\u2019 Court on 20 September 2017 to face three charges of neglecting or refusing to provide information and documents, without a reasonable excuse, when required to do so under section 72 of the Pensions Act 2004, contrary to section 77(1) of that Act. Earlier this year the regulator started legal action to try and force Chappell to pay as much as \u00a317m into the failed retailer\u2019s pension scheme. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s graphic on the day\u2019s fall in the pound so far: The UK\u2019s net borrowing for the year to March 2017 has been revised lower again, the latest ONS figures show. It decreased by \u00a327bn to \u00a345.1bn compared with the previous financial year, the lowest level of borrowing since the year to March 2008. In May the ONS said the figure for the year to March 207 was \u00a348.7bn. Back to the UK public finances and a good sign for the chancellor: Over in Germany, the monthly economic sentiment index has come in below expectations. The ZEW Institute said there was a \u201cstrong decrease in expectations\u201d as the index fell from 17.5 in July to 10 in August, worse than the figure of 15 that analysts had been expecting. The figure is well below the long term average of 23.8 points. ZEW president professor Achim Wambach said: The significant decrease of the ZEW economic sentiment indicator reflects the high degree of nervousness over the future path of growth in Germany. Both weaker than expected German exports as well as the widening scandal in the German automobile sector in particular have helped contribute to this situation. Overall, the economic outlook still remains relatively stable at a fairly high level. The better than expected UK public sector finances have done little for the pound, at least as far as the dollar is concerned. It is now down 0.4% at $1.2847. But it is down just 0.01% against the euro at \u20ac1.0915, as the single currency comes under pressure ahead of the Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers later this week. This chart shows the monthly as well as the cumulative borrowing figures: And borrowing as a percentage of GDP: The receipts from self-assessed income tax, which increased by \u00a30.8bn to \u00a38.0bn compared with July 2016, represented the highest level of July self-assessed receipts on record (records began in 1999). BREAKING NEWS: Britain has seen the first July surplus since 2002, defying expectations of another deficit. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a surplus of \u00a30.184bn compared with expectations the government would borrow around \u00a31bn. That compares with a deficit of \u00a30.308bn in July 2016. That means the total cumulative borrowing for the year so far is \u00a322.8bn, up 9% on the same period last year. On BHP, analyst Nicholas Hyett at Hargreaves Lansdown said: The headline news today is BHP\u2019s decision to exit onshore oil &amp; gas in the US. Coming after pressure from activist investor Elliott International to spin off the entire US oil &amp; gas business, the move is likely to be seen as a capitulation by the board, which had previously argued that the division formed a core part of the group\u2019s operations. However while that volte face may attract headlines, management\u2019s strategy elsewhere seems to be going smoothly and delivering results. The focus on cost control at BHP\u2019s already very low cost assets, means cash generation is soaring now commodity prices have turned. Net debt is tumbling, and as that falls towards more sustainable levels it will free up cash for other uses. Next year a significant portion of the spare cash is going on increased capital spending, particularly in Petroleum and expanding existing mines. But since the group has already proven itself willing to return more than the 50% of earnings its dividend policy dictates, returns to shareholders could benefit as well. As ever though, that assumes stable commodity prices, and if the last two years have taught us anything it\u2019s the risks of making that kind of assumption. Back with the stock market, and BHP Billiton is a positive story for the day. The mining group\u2019s shares are up 3% after it reported a jump in profits from $1.2bn to $6.7bn and confirmed that it planned to dispose of its underperforming US shale oil and gas business after pressure from activist investors. The latest grocery market share figures are out, and it is a moment to savour. Sarah Butler reports: Lidl has overtaken Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s seventh largest grocer as increasingly cash-strapped shoppers turn to the discounters. The German discount chain reached a new market share high of 5.2% as sales rose 18.9% in the 12 weeks to 13 August \u2013 making it the UK\u2019s fastest-growing grocer, according to the latest market share data from analysts Kantar Worldpanel. Fellow discounter Aldi\u2019s sales rose by 17.2% taking it to a 7% market share. Aldi overtook Waitrose in 2015. The first British Lidl opened its doors in 1994 and it now has a chain of more than 650 stores after an ambitious expansion programme. Although Lidl has overtaken Waitrose, the upmarket grocer\u2019s share of sales held steady at 5.1%. It managed to increase sales by 2.8% year on year, continuing an unbroken run of growth dating back to March 2009. The \u201cbig four\u201d \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s Asda and Morrisons \u2013 all increased sales for the fifth period in a row, their best performance since 2013, but nevertheless lost market share as the discounters grew much faster. The full story is here: Provident Financial continues to slide, now down 60%. This means it has lost around \u00a31.5bn so far today. The pound continues to slip back, down 0.12% to a new eight-year low of \u20ac1.0903 against the euro. Against the dollar, sterling is 0.33% lower at \u00a21.2856. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling dipped against both the dollar and the euro after the bell...The currency could be helped out, however, by the July\u2019s public sector net borrowing figures, which is expected to see a tax receipt-boosted improvement on June\u2019s \u00a36.9bn deficit. Provident Financial shares are now down 53%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Hedge funds that built up short positions in Provident Financial made the right call after another, much bigger, warning has rattled investors and sunk the stock. Provident shares, already down 45% since May, tumbled another 43% on the open, on course for one of the biggest ever one-day falls for a FTSE 100 stock. A catastrophic share price drop in a subprime lender \u2013 it\u2019s like the last ten years never happened. Is this a Northern Rock moment? Probably not \u2013 this is more about management failings than a market-wide issue: rivals are taking market share. The new home credit model isn\u2019t working and drastic action is required. CEO Peter Crook is out and a turnaround is underway already. The previously-announced dividend is being withdrawn and investors shouldn\u2019t expect anything until we see significant improvements. The 5.5% dividend yield was really the last leg holding the stock up but this key support has now gone. Provident seems to have run into some IT problems on top of the morale and recruitment issues relating to the restructuring. Execution risks remain and there is no easy way out from this hole. Management will take a long time to regain credibility. This comes just a couple of months after a profits warning off the back of the disruption of moving to the new operating model. It clearly wasn\u2019t going well and, with profits warnings rarely standalone events, there is a touch of inevitably about this. The performance is abysmal and significantly worse than management ever could have imagined. Collections are running at 57% compared with 90% in 2016, while sales are \u00a39m per week lower than the comparative weeks in 2016. This blows another hole in the guidance and Provident is now forecasting a net loss of \u00a380m-\u00a3120m. Is this the end? There must be some sense that things cannot get any worse. A review and turnaround is in process. Other areas of the business remain profitable with Vanquis Bank, Moneybarn and Satsuma all still in line with expectations. As expected, European investors are in a brighter mood. Despite the collapse in Provident Financial \u2013 now down 45% \u2013 the FTSE 100 is up 0.6%. Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.8%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.5% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is up 0.7%. Unsurprisingly, Provident Financial shares have tanked, falling 44% in early trading. The company, which joined the FTSE 100 in December 2015, is the biggest loser in the leading index. The chief executive of Provident Financial. Peter Crook, is leaving after the UK lender issued its second profit warning in two months and said it would not pay a dividend this year as well as cancelling a previously promised payout. It also announced its Vanquis Bank was being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority over its repayment option plan. It said: In view of the substantial deterioration in the trading performance of the home credit business, together with the uncertainty created by the FCA\u2019s investigation at Vanquis Bank, the board has determined that the group must protect its capital base and financial flexibility by withdrawing the interim dividend declared on 25 July 2017 and indicate that a full year dividend is unlikely. Reuters reports: The company has been struggling to reorganise its door-to-door subprime lending business, warning in June that its profit would fall as it struggles to switch from using self-employed debt collection agents to employees on its payroll. Provident Financial, which provides credit to people who do not meet the loan criteria of mainstream banks, billed the reorganisation as a way to create a more efficient and effective home credit business. But it has found it harder than expected to recruit agents. The firm said on Tuesday the rate of progress being made in the turnaround of the home credit unit is \u201ctoo weak\u201d and that the business is now falling a long way short of achieving the objectives set out. Collections performance and sales are both substantially underperforming against last year, Provident Financial said, adding that the pre-exceptional loss for the business is now likely to be in a range of \u00a380m to \u00a3120m. \u201cIn response, a thorough and rapid review of home credit\u2019s performance is underway to secure the turnaround of the business,\u201d the company said. Manjit Wolstenholme will assume the role of executive chairman as Crook departs. Analyst Peter Lenardos at RBC Europe said: While Provident is down nearly 40% year-to-date, we expect ongoing substantial losses in the share price, and would not be buyers at any price. While the share correction was making us warm to Provident, this quadruple whammy (another profit warning, no dividend, FCA investigation and CEO departure) lead us to now believe that the shares are not investible until greater clarity is received, which may not be until next year at the earliest. Numis said: The FCA is also investigating the group\u2019s ROP product (Provident\u2019s version of PPI) and should they have to repay all of the premiums as the banks have done it could question the viability of the group. Not much in the way of corporate news, but we do have figures from the UK housebuilder Persimmon. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports: Persimmon, one of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, says it has fared better than expected since last year\u2019s Brexit vote, and is looking forward to a good autumn sales season. It posted a 30% rise in profit before tax to \u00a3457.4m in the first six months of the year. The company built 556 more homes than in the same period last year \u2013 a total of 7,794 homes, up 8% \u2013 and raised its average selling price by 4% to \u00a3213,262. The sales price for its upmarket Charles Church brand rose by 9.4% to \u00a3347,819. Chief executive Jeff Fairburn said: Through the second half of 2016, the group experienced stronger market conditions than expected post the EU referendum on 23 June 2016, particularly through the traditionally slower summer weeks. Against these stronger comparatives, customer interest over the last seven weeks from 1 July has remained robust and our average weekly private sales rate per site was 2% ahead of the same period last year. Analyst Anthony Codling at Jefferies said: A very strong, sector-leading performance from Persimmon in the first half, delivering operating margin growth of 380 basis points to 27.6%. In our view, Help to Buy is acting as a bulletproof vest for the new-build sector allowing it to ride above the challenges faced by the secondhand market, with Persimmon continuing to balance the markets appetite more new homes with investors\u2019 desires for higher cash returns. After a pretty gloomy day for European markets on Monday - in keeping with the weather - the prospects for today are looking a little brighter. A slight recovery on Wall Street - helped by further weakness in the dollar - has given a bit of a lift to sentiment. In Asia the Hang Seng has climbed 1% although the Nikkei is virtually unchanged, down 0.05%. Europe is expected to adopt the positive trend: But the concerns troubling investors have not gone away. Tensions between the US and North Korea have not gone away, the turmoil at the White House continues, and there is also nervousness ahead of the Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers later in the week. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A slightly busier day today after a relatively quiet Monday, with UK public finances the main focus. The July figure is expected to show an improvement on the previous month\u2019s number, which showed the government borrowing a higher-than-expected \u00a36.9bn. Helped by tax receipts, last month\u2019s rise in borrowing is expected to be just \u00a31bn. Economists at RBC said: July is a seasonally strong month for government tax receipts as corporation tax instalments are paid as well as a second wave of self-assessment liabilities being settled by individuals. Therefore, the cumulative deficit for 2017-18 is only expected to expand by \u00a31bn (PSNB ex banking groups measure) to a total of just over \u00a327bn. The full-year target for the deficit is \u00a358.3bn. Revisions to the target are likely in the Budget later in the year. Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics said: The public finance figures should show that borrowing fell a little on the year in July... Although the economy slowed in the first quarter, corporate profitability has remained strong. Later come the CBI industrial trends survey and the latest German confidence figures, which are expected to show a fall from 17.5 to around 14.8. On the CBI figures, Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: An extremely positive number in July boosted confidence in the manufacturing sector, and showed output growing at its fastest rate since the mid 1990s. August is expected to show a slight slowdown to 8 from 10 in July, but nonetheless is expected to largely sustain the positive trend seen a month ago..

Not by much, but a surplus is still a surplus even if in the context of a \u00a31.8tn economy it is small change.</p> <p>This, though, was a classic case of one swallow not making a summer. For a start, the deficit in the first four months of the financial year \u2013 a much better guide to the trend than a single month\u2019s figures \u2013 was higher this year than last.</p> <p>Moreover, despite strong growth in employment, PAYE receipts last month were only 1.6% higher than in July 2016. That is entirely consistent with an economy where workers struggling to secure a decent pay rise are not paying very much tax.</p> <p>The first July surplus since 2002 was an improvement on a small \u00a3400m deficit in July 2016 but close examination of the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/july2017\">Office for National Statistics data </a>suggests that was the result of an \u00a3800m jump in receipts from self-employment.</p> <p>But as a number of analysts pointed out, in 2016 the deadline for the self-employed fell on a weekend, with the result that many payments were not processed until August. To judge whether there has been any real improvement in self-employment receipts we will have to wait for the August data to come out.</p> </blockquote> <p>Larry\u2019s full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/22/uk-public-finances-financial-crash-recessions\">UK is briefly in the black \u2013 but fixing the public finances will take time | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-22T12:41:26.157Z\">at 1.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-599c1f0be4b0ee47ab0aea79\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-22T12:09:52.964Z\">1.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Birdyword/status/899965497227259904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u00a3 at nearly \u20ac0.92.

This compared to a shortfall of \u00a3308m in July 2016.</p> <p>June\u2019s shortfall was also revised down to \u00a36.2bn from a previously reported \u00a36.9bn. Even so, June\u2019s shortfall was up markedly from \u00a34.8bn a year earlier - partly due to a major payment to the EU budget as well as higher debt interest payments.</p> <p>Completing a hat-trick of good news, the 2016/17 budget shortfall was trimmed again to \u00a345.1bn from \u00a346.2bn.</p> <p>The public finances particularly benefited in July from a 10.6% year-on-year (y/y) rise in self-assessed income tax receipts, which ties in with the resilience of the labour market...</p> <p>If the pattern of the first four months were repeated over the full fiscal year, 2017/18 public borrowing would come in at \u00a349.2bn. This would be well below the shortfall of \u00a358.3bn forecast by the ONS in March\u2019s Budget.</p> <p>While a struggling economy and higher interest debt payments look likely to weigh down on the public finances over the coming months, there\u2019s a good chance that the chancellor will have a little wiggle room in November\u2019s Budget. </p> <p>Rising dissatisfaction with austerity and the public sector pay cap is exerting pressure on the government to recalibrate fiscal policy in November\u2019s Budget.

CEO Peter Crook is out and a turnaround is underway already. The previously-announced dividend is being withdrawn and investors shouldn\u2019t expect anything until we see significant improvements. The 5.5% dividend yield was really the last leg holding the stock up but this key support has now gone. </p> <p>Provident seems to have run into some IT problems on top of the morale and recruitment issues relating to the restructuring. Execution risks remain and there is no easy way out from this hole.</p> <p>Management will take a long time to regain credibility. This comes just a couple of months after a profits warning off the back of the disruption of moving to the new operating model. It clearly wasn\u2019t going well and, with profits warnings rarely standalone events, there is a touch of inevitably about this.</p> <p>The performance is abysmal and significantly worse than management ever could have imagined. Collections are running at 57% compared with 90% in 2016, while sales are \u00a39m per week lower than the comparative weeks in 2016. </p> <p>This blows another hole in the guidance and Provident is now forecasting a net loss of \u00a380m-\u00a3120m. </p> <p>Is this the end? There must be some sense that things cannot get any worse. A review and turnaround is in process.

The July figure is expected to show an improvement on the previous month\u2019s number, which showed the government borrowing a higher-than-expected \u00a36.9bn. Helped by tax receipts, last month\u2019s rise in borrowing is expected to be just \u00a31bn. Economists at RBC said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>July is a seasonally strong month for government tax receipts as corporation tax instalments are paid as well as a second wave of self-assessment liabilities being settled by individuals.</p> <p>Therefore, the cumulative deficit for 2017-18 is only expected to expand by \u00a31bn (PSNB ex banking groups measure) to a total of just over \u00a327bn. The full-year target for the deficit is \u00a358.3bn. Revisions to the target are likely in the Budget later in the year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The public finance figures should show that borrowing fell a little on the year in July... Although the economy slowed in the first quarter, corporate profitability has remained strong.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later come the CBI industrial trends survey and the latest German confidence figures, which are expected to show a fall from 17.5 to around 14.8.</p> <p>On the CBI figures, Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An extremely positive number in July boosted confidence in the manufacturing sector, and showed output growing at its fastest rate since the mid 1990s. August is expected to show a slight slowdown to 8 from 10 in July, but nonetheless is expected to largely sustain the positive trend seen a month ago..</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The agenda:</strong><br></p> <p>9.30 BST UK public finances (July)</p> <p>10.00 BST German ZEW confidence survey (August)</p> <p>11.00 BST CBI industrial trends (August)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-22T06:59:04.200Z\">at 7.59am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "The government was in the happy \u2013 and unusual \u2013 position of being in the black in July. To the surprise of the City, tax receipts were higher than public spending. Not by much, but a surplus is still a surplus even if in the context of a \u00a31.8tn economy it is small change. This, though, was a classic case of one swallow not making a summer. For a start, the deficit in the first four months of the financial year \u2013 a much better guide to the trend than a single month\u2019s figures \u2013 was higher this year than last. Moreover, despite strong growth in employment, PAYE receipts last month were only 1.6% higher than in July 2016. That is entirely consistent with an economy in which workers struggling to secure a decent pay rise are not paying very much tax. The first July surplus since 2002 was an improvement on a small \u00a3400m deficit in July 2016. But close examination of the Office for National Statistics data suggests that was the result of an \u00a3800m jump in receipts from self-employment. As a number of analysts pointed out, in 2016 the deadline for the self-employed fell on a weekend, with the result that many payments were not processed until August. To judge whether there has been any real improvement in self-employment receipts we will have to wait for the August data to come out. The bigger picture is this. On current trends, the public finances are likely to be in the red by about \u00a350bn for the 2017-18 financial year as a whole \u2013 a bit worse than last year when the figures were flattered by a couple of one-off factors. Ministers will doubtless say that they have cut the deficit by two-thirds from its peacetime high of more than \u00a3150bn in 2009-10, but the real story is that repairing the hole in the public finances after the financial crash is taking a lot longer than it did after previous recessions. Seven years after the trough of the 1980-81 recession, the public finances were so strong that Nigel Lawson was able to cut the top rate of income tax from 60% to 40% and the standard rate from 27% to 25%. Seven years after the trough of the 1990-91 recession, Gordon Brown was running a budget surplus. On current plans, it will not be until the middle of the next decade before the books are finally balanced. That\u2019s not because the government has been less assiduous in implementing austerity measures than the administrations in the 1980s and 1990s. It is because the initial shock from the financial collapse was more severe and the subsequent recovery, in large part due to ill-timed and excessive austerity, has been much weaker. Former Lloyds boss may have a case, but what can he gain? Eric Daniels was running Lloyds Bank when it received a \u00a320bn bailout from the UK taxpayer in 2008. The 66-year-old American was chief executive when the high street lender was up to its neck in the protection payment insurance scandal, the mis-selling of which has so far cost Lloyds \u00a318bn in compensation. He left the bank with a \u00a35m pension pot in 2011 but, as the PPI bills mounted, had a \u00a31.45m bonus for 2010 pared back to \u00a3300,000. As tends to be par for the course, Daniels subsequently picked up a portfolio of new jobs: here a role with a boutique investment bank, there a non-executive directorship with a private equity firm. He has been doing all right for himself and could have decided to continue living in lucrative obscurity. Instead, Daniels has decided to sue his former employers for a bonus \u2013 running into hundreds of thousands of pounds \u2013 that he says he should have received for hitting performance targets. Daniels can certainly afford the very best legal advice and he has no doubt been told that, by the terms of his contract, he has a case. But unless Lloyds decided to settle quietly out of court, it is hard to see what Daniels expects to gain from his action. Even if he is right by the letter of the law, he is wrong in every other way. The public was disgusted by the way in which the bankers behaved before, during and after the financial crash \u2013 and understandably so. There was a sense, as ordinary voters paid for the mistakes and malfeasances of the City, that the financiers simply didn\u2019t get it. Daniels\u2019 decision to sue Lloyds suggests that they still don\u2019t.",

On current trends, the public finances are likely to be in the red by about \u00a350bn for the 2017-18 financial year as a whole \u2013 a bit worse than last year when the figures were flattered by a couple of one-off factors.</p> <p>Ministers will doubtless say that they have cut the deficit by two-thirds from its peacetime high of more than \u00a3150bn in 2009-10, but the real story is that repairing the hole in the public finances after the financial crash is taking a lot longer than it did after previous recessions.</p> <p>Seven years after the trough of the 1980-81 recession, the public finances were so strong that Nigel Lawson was able to cut the top rate of income tax from 60% to 40% and the standard rate from 27% to 25%. Seven years after the trough of the 1990-91 recession, Gordon Brown was running a budget surplus.</p> <p>On current plans, it will not be until the middle of the next decade before the books are finally balanced. That\u2019s not because the government has been less assiduous in implementing austerity measures than the administrations in the 1980s and 1990s. It is because the initial shock from the financial collapse was more severe and the subsequent recovery, in large part due to ill-timed and excessive austerity, has been much weaker.</p> <h2>Former Lloyds boss may have a case, but what can he gain? </h2> <p>Eric Daniels was running Lloyds Bank when it received a \u00a320bn bailout from the UK taxpayer in 2008. The 66-year-old American was chief executive when the high street lender was up to its neck in the protection payment insurance scandal, the mis-selling of which has so far cost Lloyds \u00a318bn in compensation. He left the bank with a \u00a35m pension pot in 2011 but, as the PPI bills mounted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2013/mar/25/lloyds-clawback-eric-daniels-bonus\">had a \u00a31.45m bonus for 2010 pared back to \u00a3300,000.</a></p> <p>As tends to be par for the course, Daniels subsequently picked up a portfolio of new jobs: here a role with a boutique investment bank, there a non-executive directorship with a private equity firm. He has been doing all right for himself and could have decided to continue living in lucrative obscurity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/22/eric-daniels-lloyds-sues-bank-bonus-taxpayer-bailout\">Former Lloyds boss Eric Daniels sues bank for withheld bonuses</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/july2017\">Instead, Daniels has decided to sue his former employers for a bonus </a>\u2013 running into hundreds of thousands of pounds \u2013 that he says he should have received for hitting performance targets. Daniels can certainly afford the very best legal advice and he has no doubt been told that, by the terms of his contract, he has a case.</p> <p>But unless Lloyds decided to settle quietly out of court, it is hard to see what Daniels expects to gain from his action. Even if he is right by the letter of the law, he is wrong in every other way.</p> <p>The public was disgusted by the way in which the bankers behaved before, during and after the financial crash \u2013 and understandably so. There was a sense, as ordinary voters paid for the mistakes and malfeasances of the City, that the financiers simply didn\u2019t get it.

      "bodyText": "The government ran the first July budget surplus in more than a decade last month, as Britain\u2019s public finances recorded an unexpected leap back into the black with help from an increase in self-assessed tax payments. Public sector net borrowing last month, excluding the nationalised banks, was in surplus by \u00a3184m, the first surplus in that month since 2002, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Tuesday. City economists had expected the government to record a \u00a31bn deficit. Receipts from self-assessed income tax increased by \u00a3800m to \u00a38bn last month, compared with July 2016, giving the government the highest level of July self-assessed tax receipts since it started recording these payments in 1999. While the increase reflects rising numbers of self-employed workers, January and July are typically busier months for self-assessed returns. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said the figures were a welcome boost for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who now had a \u201cvery decent chance\u201d of undershooting his 2017-18 fiscal target. \u201cWhile a struggling economy and higher interest debt payments look likely to hamper the public finances over the coming months, the chancellor does look to have a very good chance of having some wiggle room in November\u2019s budget,\u201d he said. However, Britain is still in the red for the current financial year, as public sector net borrowing excluding state-owned banks increased by \u00a31.9bn to \u00a322.8bn in the four months to July, compared with a year ago. Analysts at Capital Economics expected the improvement last month to be a \u201ctemporary blip\u201d. \u201cDespite July\u2019s strength the chancellor may still find that he has little scope for any easing back on the planned fiscal squeeze in his November budget,\u201d said Ruth Gregory, UK economist. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, expects \u00a358.3bn of public sector borrowing during the current financial year, an increase of \u00a313.2bn on the year ending March 2017. That borrowing, excluding the banks, equated to 87.5% of GDP at the end of July, according to the figures. The borrowing figures come amid rising dissatisfaction with austerity. The chancellor faces increasing pressure to lift the cap on public sector pay, though he may have limited room for manoeuvre if he sticks rigidly to the government\u2019s deficit reduction plan. Hammond has stated that he remains committed to the fiscal rules he set out at the autumn statement, which aim to lead to a balanced budget by the mid-2020s. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cWe are making good progress in strengthening our public finances and living within our means. Our national debt, at \u00a365,000 for every UK household, is still too high. That is why we have a clear fiscal plan to reduce our debts and build a stronger economy for every household.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s largest commercial property company has pulled out of a \u00a3470m purchase of Nine Elms Square in south-west London after pressure from regulators in Beijing over its overseas investments. A joint venture between St Modwen Properties and construction firm Vinci had exchanged contracts to sell the 4-hectare (10-acre) site, previously home to the New Covent Garden flower market, to Dalian Wanda\u2019s Hong Kong division in June. The site has now been sold to two Chinese developers, R&amp;F Properties and C C Land Holdings. Because the deal was done offshore it did not require approval from Chinese regulators, a source involved with the transaction told Reuters. The CC Land, which is based in Hong Kong, bought London\u2019s \u201cCheesegrater\u201d tower for \u00a31.15bn in March. Nine Elms Square, which has planning permission for 1,900 \u201chigh-quality\u201d flats, most with river views, forms part of the revamp of the area south of the Thames around Battersea power station, where 20,000 mainly luxury homes are being built by a number of developers. It is London\u2019s largest residential development area. Dalian Wanda, whose assets range from property to cinemas, is run by one of China\u2019s richest men, Wang Jianlin. It is one of the companies that have been most affected by the Chinese government\u2019s clampdown on capital outflows to protect the yuan from further weakening. Beijing issued rules last Friday to limit overseas investment in property, hotels, entertainment, sports clubs and the film industry, and threatened to blacklist firms that violated those rules. This could put an end to Chinese firms\u2019 recent spending spree in the UK. Chinese investors have spent a record \u00a34bn on commercial property in the City of London and the West End so far this year, according to data from real estate firm CBRE. The \u201cWalkie Talkie\u201d tower in the City was sold to Hong Kong food conglomerate Lee Kum Kee for a record-breaking \u00a31.3bn last month. The new rules are the latest setback for Wanda, whose planned $1bn (\u00a3780m) acquisition of the US TV company Dick Clark Productions fell through in March under pressure from Beijing. Squeezed for finance, the conglomerate agreed last month to sell most of its hotels and theme parks for $9.5bn to R&amp;F Properties and another developer, Sunac China, in separate transactions. The Chinese government has reportedly blocked banks from funding some of Wanda\u2019s overseas investments. The downturn in the London luxury housing market amid a glut of new properties coming on to the market made Nine Elms Square a risky investment for Wanda. It is still building the \u00a3700m One Nine Elms twin-tower complex nearby. The Malaysian developers of the nearby Battersea power station redevelopment have also been hit by the slump in sales at the top end of the market, and are scaling back plans for luxury homes.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lidl has overtaken Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s seventh largest grocer as increasingly cash-strapped shoppers turn to the discounters. The German discount chain reached a new market share high of 5.2% as sales rose 18.9% in the 12 weeks to 13 August \u2013 making it the UK\u2019s fastest growing grocer, according to the latest market share data from analysts Kantar Worldpanel. Fellow discounter Aldi\u2019s sales rose by 17.2%, giving it a 7% market share. Aldi overtook Waitrose in 2015. The first British Lidl opened in 1994. The chain now has more than 650 stores nationwide after an ambitious expansion programme. Aldi is also rapidly opening new stores and some analysts believe the two grocers could more than double their market share from a combined figure of just over 12% to as much as a quarter of the market. Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at TCC Global, said many senior supermarket bosses were operating under that assumption. \u201cThese chains are destined to become very substantial indeed,\u201d he said. Roberts said the discounters were persuading shoppers to fill a trolley rather than a small basket and it was not all about price. They are also attracting families and more middle-class shoppers after broadening their ranges to include more fresh foods, such as bakery items, as well as good own-label alternatives to family basics such as nappies. Although Lidl has overtaken Waitrose, the upmarket grocer\u2019s share of sales held steady at 5.1%. It managed to increase year-on-year sales by 2.8%, continuing an unbroken run of growth dating back to March 2009. The \u201cbig four\u201d \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 all increased sales for the fifth period in a row, their best performance since 2013, but nevertheless lost market share as the discounters grew much faster. \u201cThis welcome period of sustained growth hasn\u2019t been enough to entirely offset pressure from the discounters,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt of Kantar. \u201cThe big four now account for just 69.3% of the UK grocery market \u2013 down from 76.3% five years ago \u2013 and that looks set to fall further in the coming months.\u201d The grocery market is being lifted by inflation, underpinned by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote last year. Kantar found the rate of inflation had increased slightly to 3.3% in the latest three-month period after being at 3.2% for the past two months. At the current rate, price increases could add a further \u00a3138 to the average household\u2019s annual grocery bill. Prices are rising fastest in butter, fish and cola drinks but Kantar said all major grocery categories were now registering inflation. While overall supermarket sales rose 4% during the period, Kantar said poor weather had affected sales of summer favourites in the past month. Ice-cream sales were down 9%, while sales of burgers declined by 25% as rain dampened the nation\u2019s appetite for barbecues.",
