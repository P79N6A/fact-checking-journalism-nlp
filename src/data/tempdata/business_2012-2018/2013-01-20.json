    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Eighty years ago, when Franklin D Roosevelt was waiting to move into the White House and the New Deal was still in the future, Britain was already recovering from the Great Depression. As the first country to come off the gold standard during the crisis of 1929-31 the UK had the advantage of being the first country to devalue, and that \u2013 together with the protective wall around the British empire \u2013 helped manufacturers to export. Departure from the gold standard in September 1931 also let the national government run a cheap money policy. The bank rate was cut to 2%, which is where it remained for almost 20 years. The result was the building boom that gave us the 1930s semi. The contrast with the tepid recovery from the deep recession of 2008-09 is marked. An entire US presidential term has come and gone for Barack Obama without Britain showing signs of meaningful recovery. Two years ago a cold snap in December was blamed for the contraction of the economy in the final three months of 2010, but the fall in national output proved more than a blip. Despite a depreciation of sterling comparable with that which followed departure from the gold standard, manufacturing output has not picked up. The bank rate has been 0.5% for the past four years yet house building last year was at its lowest since the 1920s. This week's GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 2012 are likely to show a continuation of the flatlining pattern of the past two years. Having set out with the honourable intention of rebalancing the UK's lopsided economy away from consumer and public spending towards investment and exports, ministers are no longer bothered where the growth comes from provided there is some. The Bank of England and the Treasury are excited about the signs from the funding for lending scheme, which provides cheap funds for banks only if they are prepared to lend more at lower rates to their customers. Mortgage lending is on the rise, albeit from low levels. It's hard not to think that the approach of the 1930s was a lot more sensible. Building houses, both before and after the second world war, helped not just tackle overcrowding and squalor but also ensured house prices stayed relatively stable until the early 1970s. Government policy today has the avowed intent of pushing up asset prices, which is good news for the haves but not so for the have nots. It may take many years for this approach to work. Mortgages are still out of reach for first-time buyers unless they can find deposits of 15-20%. That takes some doing when the average cost of a home in the UK is \u00a3160,000-plus, and a lot more than that in London and the south-east. The squeeze on real incomes combined with job insecurity explains why housing transactions are half what they were before the 2007 crash. Vince Cable, the business secretary, has been pressing cabinet colleagues to adopt the 1930s approach. He thinks house building is the way to get real demand into the economy quickly, and has championed the idea of government guarantees for housing associations. He said in a speech last year that there was a virtuous circle in the 1930s in which higher mortgage demand led to an increase in house building, which in turn led to lower prices and greater affordability, leading to still higher demand. \"Houses built by the private sector rocketed from around 130,000 in 1931 to almost 300,000 in 1934 and it is estimated that house building contributed almost a third of all employment increases in this period.\" A report out on Monday from the Centre for Cities, a non-partisan research unit, picks up on Cable's idea. It lists the 10 towns and cities \u2013 Oxford, London, Cambridge, Brighton, Bournemouth, Aldershot, Crawley, Reading, Bristol and Worthing \u2013 where funds aimed at kick-starting development could unlock economic growth immediately. The aim, the report says, is to get construction moving on schemes that have planning permission but where development has stalled. Rather than a blanket approach to house building, it says the focus should be on parts of the country where economic growth is strong, demand for housing is high and affordability a significant factor. Property is expensive in all the cities named, with few vacant homes and a significant number of stalled sites. By contrast, in other cities homes are much more affordable and there the vacancy rates are much higher. There are stalled developments in Burnley, Bradford, Blackpool, Hull, Dundee, Leeds, Liverpool, Bolton, Blackburn, Birkenhead and Hastings, but the Centre for Cities report suggests a better approach here would be to renovate than to build anew. \"For some cities, lack of housing prevents people accessing jobs or means they are stuck in cramped accommodation,\" said Alexandra Jones, the centre's chief executive. \"In other cities, incentives to retrofit empty houses could improve quality of life. Both approaches, adapted to local needs, would generate the jobs and growth the UK needs.\" Though the government has introduced policies to get house building moving, the report says the response has been too small, provided perverse incentives for local authorities to build when they should concentrate on retrofitting, and has failed to concentrate on areas where affordability issues are most pressing. There are deep, structural issues that make a comprehensive solution to Britain's housing problems hard to achieve. One is the concentration of power in the banking sector and the concomitant loss of local building societies. A second is the concentration of power in the construction sector. In both cases, more competition would be helpful. Then, of course, there is the tension between central and local government: should Whitehall set targets for house building (as the previous Labour government did) or should it allow local authorities to make their own decisions (albeit with a few sticks and carrots chucked in)? In the short run, though, this is a question of money. If the government wants more houses renovated it could do so by abolishing VAT on home improvements. If it wants more houses built, it is going to have to scale up substantially programmes such as Get Britain Building, which has a target of just 16,000 new homes. The budget will almost certainly mean more cash provided for guarantees but what would really make a difference would be a slug of capital spending channelled to local authorities to boost the nation's housing stock. It could be ringfenced and time-limited. Doing this, though, requires the government to accept that its economic and budget strategy is failing. It also means taking a big political risk as increasing the supply of homes means property prices will fall. That's good news for young people and the less well-off trying to get on the housing ladder, but will be resisted by those already sitting pretty. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 January 2013 to clarify that the UK was the first country to come off the gold standard during the crisis of 1929-31.",

      "bodyText": "The London-based insurance broker Aon is helping 250 of its highly paid staff avoid 50% income tax by deferring bonus payments until the new tax year. Other top brokers, including Willis, are also considering whether to allow their staff to postpone payments until after 6 April when the top rate of income tax falls to 45%. Just days after the investment bank Goldman Sachs was forced to back down on its own plans to defer bonuses, it has emerged that Aon has put mechanisms in place to delay payments for its employees so they pay income tax at 45%. The move allows an executive expecting a \u00a3200,000 payout to save \u00a310,000 in tax. Goldman's U-turn came after criticism from the Bank of England governor, Sir Mervyn King, and pressure from politicians. He told the Treasury select committee: \"I find it a bit depressing that people who earn so much seem to think it's even more exciting to kind of adjust the timing of it to get the benefit of a lower tax rate which they will benefit from in the long run to a very great extent.\" Goldman then announced it was no longer considering whether it should defer bonuses from 2009, 2010 and 2011, which were due to be handed to staff in the coming weeks, before the top rate fall. Many City employers with staff who pay the top rate of tax are known to have considered whether to defer payments into the new tax year but experts believe some of them have decided against such a move following the row over the lack of tax paid by coffee chain Starbucks in the UK. Aon is among a number of major insurers to press ahead with deferring bonus payments while Willis said it was still considering whether to do likewise. \"Willis takes this matter very seriously and we are reviewing it,\" said a spokesman for the insurer, which employs around 3,000 staff in the UK. The Aon bonuses relate to the 2012 financial year and were due to be paid in March. They will now be paid in April after the beginning of the new tax year.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For 51 weeks of the year, Davos is just another Swiss mountain resort, an architecturally drab strip town 5,000 feet up in the Alps. But at the end of January the world's movers and shakers arrive for five days of chin-wagging, deal-making and partying at the annual get-together of the World Economic Forum. The 2,500 participants this year include almost 40 heads of state and government, finance ministers, central bank governors, scientists, artists, trade unionists, anti-poverty campaigners and, of course, the highest concentration of billionaires on the planet. Angela Merkel, David Cameron and Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev are among the keynote speakers. Mali, the Middle East, Europe's debt crisis and the US fiscal cliff will be on the agenda. George Osborne is due to be in town when Britain's fourth-quarter growth figures are released on Friday. On the basis of the latest evidence, it may be more bad news for the chancellor. Expect coverage of the 43rd meeting of the forum to be peppered with references to Thomas Mann, who put Davos on the map with his book The Magic Mountain. The story, set in a sanitorium treating patients suffering from tuberculosis, provides an appropriate metaphor for the global economy still ailing nearly five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Is global capitalism going through a prolonged period of convalescence or is it suffering from an incurable sickness? Most of the chief executives and policy-makers will, unsurprisingly, opt for the former but the Davos mood is much more sombre than it was in the boom years before the crash. Now the biggest global risk is deemed to be rising inequality. Ian Fleming was another author familiar with the town. In his novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Bond flies up the Davos valley to Blofeld's mountain-top lair by helicopter \u2013 the mode of transport favoured by world leaders and those masters of the universe who are not just rich but seriously loaded. For lesser mortals, there are two choices: road or rail. The journey by coach or limo is quicker, but the three-hour train ride is a real delight. The last hour on the mountain track from Landquart is one of the great rail experiences, particularly in late afternoon when the sun is setting over the Alps. Needless to say, the trains keep running when it is snowing. There was a time when organised labour was not welcome at Davos, which as recently as the 1990s was an employers-only affair. Union leaders used to hold a press conference in the hotel next to the conference centre but are now included as part of the family along with development charities such as Oxfam and thinktanks such as the New Economics Foundation. Philip Jennings, general secretary of the global union Uni, says union concerns are taken seriously by Klaus Schwab, the man who founded the WEF in 1971 and still presides over its annual meeting. Despite lacking only the white cat to be a Blofeld lookalike, Schwab champions what he calls inclusive globalisation. Some, though, are more included than others. Status in Davos is denoted by your badge: full participants get a white badge with a blue line; their spouses get a plain white badge. Journalists who are deemed to be reporters rather than media leaders have an orange badge, it's purple for technicians and green for the entourage that Cameron and the other bigwigs will have in tow. Traditionally, the sign that you have really made it is a hologram on your full participants badge: this gets you access to an IGWEL (\"informal gathering of world economic leaders\"), the behind-closed-doors sessions where the real Davos business is done. The theme of this year's meeting is Dynamic Resilience, which, if it means anything at all, suggests companies should hope for the best and prepare for the worst. SD Shibulal (Shibu), chief executive of the Indian-based multinational Infosys, said: \"In the backdrop of a challenging macro-economic environment, business leaders are grappling with the need to drive growth and profitability. The most recent global economic turmoil is not the first of its kind and it will certainly not be the last. In fact, the frequency of their occurrence is only likely to increase in the years ahead. Changing business cycles are here to stay.\" Jennings says there are two big problems: businesses are hoarding their cash and consumers don't have enough money to spend. \"The Magic Mountain is full of dead money. There is a trillion dollars on corporate balance sheets doing nothing,\" said Jennings. The answer to a lack of global demand is simple, he insisted: \"Give the world a pay rise.\" Once the day's formal business is over, the main action shifts to the Belvedere hotel for party time. In previous years \u2013 before their tax-avoiding exploits won them the reputation of robber barons in chinos \u2013 the hottest ticket was the Google bash on the Friday night. This year, participants can rub shoulders with Charlize Theron at a Global Fund event in support of a push to fight Aids, TB and malaria or improve their minds over port and stilton with the alumni of Oxford University.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Up to 10,000 engineering jobs could have been created if the government had supported British companies bidding to win contracts to build North Sea oil rigs for energy giants, it has been claimed. The contracts went to South Korea, with the result that the industry has shed tens of thousands of jobs, something that has major implications for the UK's ability to build the next generation of carbon-friendly energy infrastructure, such as windfarms. The claims comes from OGN, a British oil rig-maker, in a letter to MPs. The row has echoes of the furore that greeted the news in 2011 that Derby-based train manufacturer Bombardier had lost out to German manufacturer Siemens in the battle to win the \u00a31.4bn Thameslink trains contract. In the letter, seen by the Observer, OGN warns that British manufacturers will go out of business if ministers do not require North Sea oil operators to buy components from them. Dennis Clark, OGN's chairman, claims that in the past two years only 7% of new platforms ordered for the North Sea were made in Britain. \"Over the past two years, fabrication contracts for North Sea development worth in excess of \u00a310 billion have been placed overseas,\" Clark writes. \"It is estimated that more than 10,000 jobs would have been created in this country had those contracts been placed in the UK.\" The privately owned company, one of only four oil rig manufacturers left in Britain, employs about 4,000 workers, down from a peak workforce of 30,000. It is furious that the Treasury granted Norwegian oil giant Statoil tax concessions to develop the Mariner and Bressay fields in the North Sea but did nothing to compel it to use British expertise. Clark complains that Norway, like many other countries, requires oil companies to use local suppliers for its offshore oil and gas projects. But the government claims European Union rules forbid it from taking such action. Sajid Javid, economic secretary to the Treasury, recently signalled the government's commitment to the offshore oil and gas industry. \"The North Sea is a vital national asset, with oil and gas production supporting a third of a million jobs,\" Javid said. \"That is why this government has announced a range of tax measures expected to generate billions of new investment and create jobs.\" But Clark complained that there was no policy requiring tax benefits to be reinvested in the UK. \"The UK is the only oil and gas province without a positive policy favouring local content,\" Clark said in the letter. \"Norway has operated such a policy with great success for 30 years and it has filled its own fabrication capacity.\" He said he had taken the matter up with several ministers including the chancellor, George Osborne, and the business secretary, Vince Cable. \"Everyone is interested but nobody will take decisive action,\" Clark said. \"The government says that it cannot intervene. We do not believe this to be the case and we appear to have the only government that adopts this stance.\" A number of MPs in the north east have tabled questions in the Commons to ask what the government is doing to protect the UK's oil rig constructors. The Labour MP, Nick Brown, said he was seeking clarification from the government as to why other countries could ensure contracts went to their companies. \"It is reasonable for us to expect the North Sea to support a strong domestic industry,\" Brown said. \"I'm in favour of free trade, but what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.\" According to analysis by OGN, a total of 209,000 tonnes of fabrication structures have been awarded outside the UK in the past two years. This equates to a loss to the UK economy of 12,100 direct man years of blue-collar jobs. It said the jobs were transferable to the offshore renewable energy sector and warned that the UK's wind and tidal projects would end up creating employment abroad unless the government changed its stance.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "For airlines, fuel efficiency, quietness and a unique range far outweigh a battery problem that will be fixed", 
      "body": "<p>As Boeing showed off its multibillion-dollar baby on the Dreamliner's promotional world tour in 2011, one quirky feature was regularly pointed out: a sleekly designed but redundant ashtray, a compliance with regulations laid down in a different age. In the darkest torments of Boeing executives during the past few incident-packed weeks, it may have finally appeared of use: somewhere to enjoy the cigarette of the condemned, a quiet smoke to mask the smell of burning battery.</p> <p>A little over a week ago, America's government and air authorities stood shoulder to shoulder with their top exporter, Boeing, to assure the world that the plane was safe after a string of incidents from fuel leaks, windscreen cracks and battery fires. They still say it \u2013 only, right now, that no one should fly in it.</p> <p>By Wednesday, a diagnosis of teething problems was no longer enough. The burning battery was back, and Japanese authorities said the latest incident was \"highly serious\". Corrosive fluid had leaked down through the state-of-the-art electronics below the cockpit. Hideyo Kosugi, a Japanese safety investigator surveying the All Nippon Airways 787 that had made an emergency landing at Takamatsu airport, said the stuff had gone right through the floor.</p> <p>After the Japanese airlines operating almost half of the Dreamliners worldwide decided they could risk it no longer, the US Federal Aviation Administration grounded all 787s in its jurisdiction. From India to Qatar, Poland to Chile and finally Ethiopia, the global fleet was taken out of action, an ignominious fate for a plane that had been so eagerly anticipated for so very long.</p> <p>In an industry where different models are normally denoted by numbers alone, naming the 787 the Dreamliner was to invite attention: a bold statement that this was to be something fundamentally different. This craft does not simply carry the commercial aspirations of Boeing; it has become symbolic of aviation's promises for a greener, quieter future.</p> <p>For passengers, there was the thrill of bigger windows, funky lighting and increased cabin pressure, said to reduce the ill-effects of flying. Thomson, the first UK customer, has built an ad campaign around it. But for airlines, the critical selling point was fuel efficiency, where the airline executives' and the environmentalists' interests briefly coincide.</p> <p>While rivals mutter that the aspirations have yet to be matched in operations, the lighter plane promised a 20% cut in the soaring fuel bills that have wiped out profits for many airlines.</p> <p>The Dreamliner also promised a range unique for an aircraft of its size, potentially making direct flights to long-haul destinations viable with fewer passengers, not least, the secondary cities in the emerging Bric economies \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 to which business people in the UK apparently clamour to fly.</p> <p>Improvements in those spheres are by no means unique to the Dreamliner. But perhaps more than any other plane, it has come to represent the technological innovation that the aviation industry claims will allow it to meet its wider obligations to the world: that we can fly and not fry, even with ever more flights.</p> <p>A carbon dioxide \"roadmap\" produced by Sustainable Aviation, an industry group addressing environmental issues, sees the fuel efficiencies delivered by the 787 and its successors as a way to cut about a third of all projected carbon emissions, a major part of a plan that would let traffic double by 2050 and still meet the emissions targets aviation signed up to in the wake of the Kyoto climate negotiations.</p> <p>For airports in Britain's crowded south-east, the Dreamliner is also a name to conjure with. Briefly in operation here since Qatar Airways' inaugural flight just before Christmas, it claims a \"noise footprint\" some 60% smaller than other planes its size. Around Heathrow, such contours spell votes: Boris Johnson has spoken of 750,000 Londoners having their lives blighted by aircraft noise</p> <p>As Howard Davies's commission sits down to reflect over the next two and a half years on the future shape of Britain's airport capacity, Heathrow will want to demonstrate that noise is not a insurmountable political obstacle. Current proposals from the Department for Transport, penned before Justine Greening was shuffled out of the department, will ramp up the fines for louder planes: Virgin's Richard Branson has suggested banning noisy aircraft from the airport \u2013 but then his airline has 16 Dreamliners arriving from next year.</p> <p>So Boeing's problems are aviation's problems too. Little wonder that few airlines, beyond the annoyance of those already operating the now-grounded 787, have offered anything but unqualified support and confidence. With 799 aircraft outstanding, the order book dwarfs the 50 in service. The ambitions of the fleet planners everywhere for new routes and for lower overheads hang on the 787s rolling out of the Seattle factory.</p> <p>Observers have little doubt that the Dreamliner will fly again. Douglas McNeill, investment director at Charles Stanley, says: \"It will get fixed. Boeing just has no alternative \u2013 it's just a question of how much time and money it takes. If it's just the battery, it could be relatively simple. If it's an overhaul of the whole onboard power generation, it's a time-consuming and costly task.\"</p> <p>If safety has always been paramount, the industry is taking absolutely no chances in preserving its proud boast; according to the International Air Transport Association, 2012 was the safest year on record. McNeill dismisses safety fears: \"It would be more than odd, it would be astonishing if there was an issue that escaped the hundreds of thousands of hours of testing that Boeing and the FAA carried out.</p> <p>\"It's hard to imagine the Dreamliner not re-entering service quickly, but in the worst-case scenario it could have a real impact. It was going to be a big step forward in terms of noise and emissions.\"</p> <p>Not everything hinges on the Dreamliner: rival Airbus has the A350 coming down the line, also built with composite materials and lithium-ion batteries. It has often been described as Airbus's answer to the Dreamliner, although the European manufacturer is quick to point out that its design \u2013 and batteries \u2013 are very different to Boeing's plane.</p> <p>There was no hint of schadenfreude from boss Fabrice Br\u00e9gier at last week's Toulouse event when Airbus announced a record year for aircraft deliveries \u2013 though second to Boeing in orders. In the long term, the efficiencies will come: concerns about the new technology may again hold up the process more than those worried by climate change or the bottom line would hope. \"Airbus and Boeing will need to get these planes into service,\" McNeill adds.</p> <p>Boeing meanwhile has said it will do all it can to restore confidence. Chief executive Jim McNerney pledged to \"work around the clock\" with investigators, adding: \"We will make available the entire resources of the Boeing company to assist.\" For a corporation the size of Boeing, worth around \u00a350bn even with its shares sliding, the current problems should amount to little more than a spot of turbulence. Airbus quickly recovered confidence and orders despite cracks in the wings of its pioneering A380 in 2011. Boeing's bosses will hope that the Dreamliner can swiftly rise above its current problems and return to the skies.</p>",

In the darkest torments of Boeing executives during the past few incident-packed weeks, it may have finally appeared of use: somewhere to enjoy the cigarette of the condemned, a quiet smoke to mask the smell of burning battery. A little over a week ago, America's government and air authorities stood shoulder to shoulder with their top exporter, Boeing, to assure the world that the plane was safe after a string of incidents from fuel leaks, windscreen cracks and battery fires. They still say it \u2013 only, right now, that no one should fly in it. By Wednesday, a diagnosis of teething problems was no longer enough. The burning battery was back, and Japanese authorities said the latest incident was \"highly serious\". Corrosive fluid had leaked down through the state-of-the-art electronics below the cockpit. Hideyo Kosugi, a Japanese safety investigator surveying the All Nippon Airways 787 that had made an emergency landing at Takamatsu airport, said the stuff had gone right through the floor. After the Japanese airlines operating almost half of the Dreamliners worldwide decided they could risk it no longer, the US Federal Aviation Administration grounded all 787s in its jurisdiction. From India to Qatar, Poland to Chile and finally Ethiopia, the global fleet was taken out of action, an ignominious fate for a plane that had been so eagerly anticipated for so very long. In an industry where different models are normally denoted by numbers alone, naming the 787 the Dreamliner was to invite attention: a bold statement that this was to be something fundamentally different. This craft does not simply carry the commercial aspirations of Boeing; it has become symbolic of aviation's promises for a greener, quieter future. For passengers, there was the thrill of bigger windows, funky lighting and increased cabin pressure, said to reduce the ill-effects of flying. Thomson, the first UK customer, has built an ad campaign around it. But for airlines, the critical selling point was fuel efficiency, where the airline executives' and the environmentalists' interests briefly coincide. While rivals mutter that the aspirations have yet to be matched in operations, the lighter plane promised a 20% cut in the soaring fuel bills that have wiped out profits for many airlines. The Dreamliner also promised a range unique for an aircraft of its size, potentially making direct flights to long-haul destinations viable with fewer passengers, not least, the secondary cities in the emerging Bric economies \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 to which business people in the UK apparently clamour to fly. Improvements in those spheres are by no means unique to the Dreamliner. But perhaps more than any other plane, it has come to represent the technological innovation that the aviation industry claims will allow it to meet its wider obligations to the world: that we can fly and not fry, even with ever more flights. A carbon dioxide \"roadmap\" produced by Sustainable Aviation, an industry group addressing environmental issues, sees the fuel efficiencies delivered by the 787 and its successors as a way to cut about a third of all projected carbon emissions, a major part of a plan that would let traffic double by 2050 and still meet the emissions targets aviation signed up to in the wake of the Kyoto climate negotiations. For airports in Britain's crowded south-east, the Dreamliner is also a name to conjure with. Briefly in operation here since Qatar Airways' inaugural flight just before Christmas, it claims a \"noise footprint\" some 60% smaller than other planes its size. Around Heathrow, such contours spell votes: Boris Johnson has spoken of 750,000 Londoners having their lives blighted by aircraft noise As Howard Davies's commission sits down to reflect over the next two and a half years on the future shape of Britain's airport capacity, Heathrow will want to demonstrate that noise is not a insurmountable political obstacle. Current proposals from the Department for Transport, penned before Justine Greening was shuffled out of the department, will ramp up the fines for louder planes: Virgin's Richard Branson has suggested banning noisy aircraft from the airport \u2013 but then his airline has 16 Dreamliners arriving from next year. So Boeing's problems are aviation's problems too. Little wonder that few airlines, beyond the annoyance of those already operating the now-grounded 787, have offered anything but unqualified support and confidence. With 799 aircraft outstanding, the order book dwarfs the 50 in service. The ambitions of the fleet planners everywhere for new routes and for lower overheads hang on the 787s rolling out of the Seattle factory. Observers have little doubt that the Dreamliner will fly again. Douglas McNeill, investment director at Charles Stanley, says: \"It will get fixed. Boeing just has no alternative \u2013 it's just a question of how much time and money it takes. If it's just the battery, it could be relatively simple. If it's an overhaul of the whole onboard power generation, it's a time-consuming and costly task.\" If safety has always been paramount, the industry is taking absolutely no chances in preserving its proud boast; according to the International Air Transport Association, 2012 was the safest year on record. McNeill dismisses safety fears: \"It would be more than odd, it would be astonishing if there was an issue that escaped the hundreds of thousands of hours of testing that Boeing and the FAA carried out. \"It's hard to imagine the Dreamliner not re-entering service quickly, but in the worst-case scenario it could have a real impact. It was going to be a big step forward in terms of noise and emissions.\" Not everything hinges on the Dreamliner: rival Airbus has the A350 coming down the line, also built with composite materials and lithium-ion batteries. It has often been described as Airbus's answer to the Dreamliner, although the European manufacturer is quick to point out that its design \u2013 and batteries \u2013 are very different to Boeing's plane. There was no hint of schadenfreude from boss Fabrice Br\u00e9gier at last week's Toulouse event when Airbus announced a record year for aircraft deliveries \u2013 though second to Boeing in orders. In the long term, the efficiencies will come: concerns about the new technology may again hold up the process more than those worried by climate change or the bottom line would hope. \"Airbus and Boeing will need to get these planes into service,\" McNeill adds. Boeing meanwhile has said it will do all it can to restore confidence. Chief executive Jim McNerney pledged to \"work around the clock\" with investigators, adding: \"We will make available the entire resources of the Boeing company to assist.\" For a corporation the size of Boeing, worth around \u00a350bn even with its shares sliding, the current problems should amount to little more than a spot of turbulence. Airbus quickly recovered confidence and orders despite cracks in the wings of its pioneering A380 in 2011. Boeing's bosses will hope that the Dreamliner can swiftly rise above its current problems and return to the skies.",

      "bodyText": "There could be few better symbols of the fragile state of Britain's recession-scarred economy than the news that with HMV and Blockbuster joining the dismal roll call of retailers forced into administration, an extraordinary 1,400 shops on high streets up and down the country are now at risk of closure within less than a month. Research by the Local Data Company suggests that the combined impact on the high street of these two latest victims, together with the recent collapse of electrical retailer Comet, shoe shop Stead and Simpson, and camera specialist Jessops, has been even heavier than during 2009, when the much-loved Woolworths closed the doors of its 807 stores for the last time. Like Comet and Jessops, HMV and Blockbuster had both faced a formidable challenge to reinvent themselves as the relentless rise of online retailing rocked their respective industries. But the chronic weakness of consumer demand in Britain's flatlining economy has also been a key factor in driving so many well-known names to the wall. If none of the 1,400 stores is reoccupied, an extraordinary 19% of Britain's shop premises will stand empty. These latest very visible scars on the fabric of economic life have appeared as the coalition faces rising pressure to get a grip on a slump that has now lasted five years: what ratings agency Moody's last week called a \"lost half-decade\", echoing the name given to Japan's long period of stagnation from the early 1990s. Despite interest rates that have hovered around zero since the mid-1990s, and repeated rounds of quantitative easing, Japan has never achieved a sustained recovery. If, as many City analysts expect, official figures reveal on Friday that the UK economy slipped into reverse in the final quarter of 2012, chancellor George Osborne will face fresh questions about whether the UK is heading for its own \"lost decade\". A new report from left-leaning think-tank Compass, \"Plan B+1\", published 12 months after it first set out a blueprint for economic revival, calls for radical measures including increasing jobless benefits to boost the spending power of the poorest in society (who are more likely to spend what they receive); investing in green technologies; and reviewing every pound of government spending to assess its effectiveness in \"promoting wellbeing, environmental sustainability and reducing inequality\". David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, which represents many smaller firms, says he backs the chancellor's broad aim of tackling the deficit, but believes spending in some key areas could be increased without him losing credibility. He says: \"Our view has always been that what we need is a two-pronged strategy: not abandoning the overall fiscal plan, but adjusting it; continuing to do things that may be unpopular, like welfare reform, but taking action in all those various areas where, rather than just increasing demand, you improve the supply side of the economy.\" That might mean, for example, improving the country's infrastructure. Peter Spencer, of forecasting group the Ernst and Young Item club, which publishes its quarterly health check of the economy today, agrees: \"If they go for infrastructure \u2013 let's say \u00a315bn, financed by borrowing \u2013 it certainly wouldn't cost them their AAA rating; and over time they would get it back in tax and reduced unemployment benefits.\" The chancellor singles out Britain's cherished AAA rating as the measure of policy success, but all three of the big credit ratings agencies have warned the Treasury that the UK could be downgraded if growth continues to disappoint. City experts believe a negative GDP reading for the fourth quarter of 2012, potentially signalling the onset of a triple-dip recession, could be the trigger. With little hope that Osborne will relax his grip on the finances, one area some economists have seized on as ripe for a rethink \u2013 and one which appears to appeal to the cornered chancellor \u2013 is Britain's monetary policy regime, the role of the Bank of England in guiding the economy. Mark Carney, the hotshot Canadian hired by Osborne to take over from Sir Mervyn King this summer, sparked a flurry of excitement in policy circles before Christmas when he mused that it might be time to ditch the inflation-targeting regime that has evolved since the 1990s. Carney suggested that when, as now, interest rates are near zero and growth is weak, it might be right for central banks to take more radical action. They could, for example, copy the Federal Reserve's approach of \"forward guidance,\" announcing that it plans to keep interest rates low for a long time, at least until mid-2015. If that should fail, he added, the inflation target could be ditched in favour of using a measure of nominal GDP \u2013 the total output from the economy, measured in pounds, without adjusting for inflation. Proponents of a nominal GDP target argue that at times when growth is very low, a bit of inflation should be less of a concern than the corrosive impact on the economy of a long period of stagnation. Aiming at a nominal GDP target could, they claim, force the Bank to shrug off its concerns about inflation and go all out to kick-start growth. And during the boom years, when inflation was low but growth strong, it might have forced policymakers to push up interest rates and prevent a bubble inflating. Spencer at the Item club backs a change of regime: \"It's the sum of inflation and growth, and it would put them both on a par. It's obvious that in the present circumstances it would give the Bank latitude to allow a temporary inflation overshoot.\" However, even within its current job description of keeping inflation close to 2%, the Bank has \"aimed off\" its target during the crisis, allowing inflation to remain high, because, as King has repeatedly argued, bringing it back to 2% more rapidly would have entailed an even deeper recession and higher unemployment. Any decision about changing the inflation target would ultimately rest with the chancellor. But David Blanchflower, the former monetary policy committee member who has been highly critical of the Bank's approach, says that even if Carney arrives full of enthusiasm for embracing a new system, and wins over Whitehall, he may be stymied by his eight colleagues on the MPC. \"I say if you're going to hire the guy, fire the other eight, and let him do the job,\" he says, calling for a thorough clearout in Threadneedle Street. But not all advocates of a fresh start for the UK economy believe a shift in monetary policy should be the main tool. Adam Posen, another outspoken US academic with a stint on the MPC under his belt \u2013 he left last year \u2013 is cautious about junking the inflation target, despite calling for the Bank to take more aggressive action, such as lending directly to cash-starved businesses. Posen, who is now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, calls a money GDP target of the sort Carney has mooted \"a bit of a gimmick\", warning that it would be harder to explain to the public and would immediately be seen by financial markets as a decision to let inflation rip. And if wages remain stagnant in the face of rising prices, as has been the case over the past three years or so, higher inflation can simply depress consumer spending rather than \"inflating away\" households' debt burden, as happened in the 1970s, when wages rose in step with rocketing prices. Kern of the BCC says more quantitative easing would be unlikely to provide much of a boost. \"Quantitative easing was never a particularly powerful tool to stimulate growth,\" he says. \"Any good that more QE could do in terms of a lower pound and more exports would be more than nullified by the damage it would do to domestic demand.\" Instead of fiddling with the monetary policy regime, Posen would like to see Osborne relax his grip on the nation's purse strings and abandon his obsession with austerity: \"When you've implemented everything, and it's had the opposite effect, and it's been a bad effect, you have an ethical and public responsibility to change policy.\" A climbdown would be humiliating for a chancellor who has pinned his reputation on unstinting austerity, but the weak recovery, which has repeatedly blown a hole in the Treasury's fiscal plans, has already resulted in Osborne having to extend the planned period of austerity for three years longer than he had hoped, to 2017-18. \"It was embarrassing when the British empire had to withdraw from places such as Suez; it was embarrassing when the Bank of England had to withdraw from the European exchange rate mechanism; but both those things were for the best in the end,\" Posen says. However, despite the boarded-up shops, he does not believe the UK economy has lost the ability to pay its way in the world: \"Walking around the UK \u2013 and I don't just mean London \u2013 doesn't feel like the early 1980s, let along the late 1970s.\"",
