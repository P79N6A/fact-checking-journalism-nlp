      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s stewardship of the economy is expected to take a dent on Tuesday when the latest official figures show last year\u2019s healthy growth has lost momentum. With just over a week until the election, the chancellor will come under pressure from critics following a run of poor figures from the manufacturing and construction sectors that City economists predict have slowed growth in the first quarter. Osborne has already come under fire for presiding over a recovery that has failed to lift living standards above pre-crisis levels despite creating more than 1.5m jobs. Until recently, businesses have relied on a growing workforce of low paid, self-employed and part-time workers that has left productivity growth lagging behind most industrial nations. Economists expect Tuesday\u2019s figures to show that GDP growth slowed to a quarterly 0.5% in the first three months of this year, down from 0.6% in the final quarter of 2014. Weaker than expected industrial production, construction output and high street sales in recent months, have even encouraged some economists to pencil in a halving in the growth rate to 0.3%, according to a Reuters poll. While first estimates of GDP are often revised in later months, a weak number on Tuesday will come at a bad time for the Conservatives and their coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats. \u201cWith the first quarter GDP number published only nine days before the election, a disappointing reading could cause a headache for the incumbent parties, particularly given their desire to emphasise their economic credentials,\u201d said Andrew Goodwin, UK economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics. He is forecasting that growth could come in as soft as 0.4% but adds: \u201cWe do not think that such a low number would necessarily be an accurate depiction of the true strength of the economy.\u201d Quarterly growth and levels of GDP Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, agreed that while growth prospects remain \u201cdecent\u201d for the UK economy, the latest numbers could well play a crucial role at the ballot box. \u201cGiven that the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are hoping that many undecided voters will ultimately decide to vote for them due to their management of the economy, any slowdown in growth would be very unwelcome news just over a week before the general election,\u201d he said. Economic data points to new year slowdown Critics of Osborne\u2019s lopsided recovery, which has favoured the south and the service industries, complain that young and low paid workers have played a bigger part in the recovery than official figures show. The TUC said analysis of jobs figures showed that in addition to the 700,000 workers who report being on zero-hours contracts, there were another 820,000 UK employees who report being underemployed on between 0 and 19 hours a week. Underemployed workers were typically paid a much lower hourly rate than other employees, the TUC said, with the average hourly wage for a worker on fewer than 20 hours a week reaching just \u00a38.40 an hour, compared to \u00a313.20 an hour for all employees. A survey last week of households by financial data provider Markit showed that most believed they would get a maximum 1% pay rise this year, which is less than the 1.8% average in official figures and likely to be offset by a return of inflation later in the year. The downbeat GDP forecasts follow news last week of a surprise drop in retail sales in March as well as weak numbers from other sectors in recent weeks. \u201cThe latest official output figures have suggested that the recovery has made a poor start to 2015. Output in the industrial, construction and services sectors of the economy all fell in January ... And construction fell by a further 0.9% in February, while industrial production rose by a mere 0.1%,\u201d said economists at the thinktank Capital Economics. The IMF and OECD expect growth to slip below the UK\u2019s growth last year of 2.8%, which was the fastest pace of expansion since 2006, before the global financial crisis. There have been warnings that growth could suffer a bigger slowdown if the election is followed by a long period of political uncertainty. With the polls tight, some business surveys have suggested investment decisions are already being postponed. But there has so far been little sign of nervousness on financial markets, with the pound hitting a five-week high against the dollar of $1.514 on Friday. \u201cWith two weeks to go to polling day it would be easy to say that domestic markets will be fixated on opinion polls and major speeches. However the reality is that so far at least, currencies, interest rate, gilt and equity markets have been far more sensitive to economic than political events,\u201d said Philip Shaw, economist at the Investec. \u201cWe suspect that markets may well react to uncertainty at some stage, but it may be that as in 2010, markets only begin to take notice the day after polling day.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u2018There are some stores,\u201d Tesco\u2019s beleaguered boss Dave Lewis suggested last week, \u201cwhere we might want to put a giraffe in there.\u201d The thought was only marginally less surreal than the loss he had just announced: at \u00a36.4bn it was the largest writedown in British retail history. It was only after a moment\u2019s puzzlement that the non-specialist journos in the room realised he was talking about a restaurant, not a quaduped. Tesco, it turns out, not only owns the Giraffe restaurant chain; it has a stake in the coffee shop Harris &amp; Hoole and the Euphorium bakery, all of which run concessions in or near Tesco stores. Lewis inherited the acquisition of these family-focused cafe brands from the same management team whose stewardship led to Tesco having to restate its finances, submit to a serious fraud inquiry and report a giant loss. And though he\u2019s ditched much of the old strategy, Lewis is sticking with the idea of making Tesco stores the single \u201cdestination\u201d where people go to do all or most of their shopping. This, I think, is going to be quite tough, because to modern consumers the average supermarket \u2013 not just Tesco \u2013 can feel like a chilly, toothpaste-coloured, fluorescent-lit hell. In part, the big supermarkets have authored their own demise by fuelling the rise of their own convenience stores. Cannibalising the takings of the big stores seemed like a genius strategy when incomes were rising. But in the low-growth, deflationary economy created after the 2008 crash, and with wage stagnation, the broader business model behind all supermarkets has hit the rocks. Tactically opaque pricing, designed to skim an extra penny or two from each customer, becomes a lot harder when prices and real wages are falling; meanwhile putting relentless downward pressure on the price you pay suppliers in a period of low or zero inflation simply accelerates the race to the bottom. So maybe it\u2019s time to rethink the supermarket more radically. These institutions form a massive part of our social reality; they employ hundreds of thousands of people, and have shaped the diet of the post-1945 generations from cradle to grave. When you see the underlying profits of a major group like Tesco flattened to 1% of turnover, and its rivals engaged in money giveaways in the fight for diminishing market share, it is not crazy to ask: what are these institutions for? In the search for a new answer, I would start from the most vibrant and functional aspect of all supermarkets: their workforce. Everything in the physical architecture of a big supermarket is designed to make the workforce invisible; customer interactions are fleeting; when a person on the till suddenly cracks a pleasantry or reveals some personal detail, it is \u2013 in most supermarket groups \u2013 as if an unwritten code has been broken. So I would do something that rewarded the workforce for unleashing their wit, knowledge and expertise on the actual customers. Next, you would have to recognise the second big piece of untapped human potential supermarkets possess: they are modern agoras. In the two neighbourhoods I regularly shop \u2013 south London and west Wales \u2013 the local community is only ever truly assembled on a Friday night in the aisles of the supermarket. But the massively social nature of these spaces is \u2013 again \u2013 suppressed. If you compare the zombie-like way in which a supermarket layout forces us to behave to, say, a traditional street market, or a farmers\u2019 market, you get a sense of what we are missing. A third revolutionary thing you could do is socialise the customer-relationship data. Tesco knows all the varieties of tomato sauce I have ever poured on to my pasta; how long it takes me to get through a wedge of parmesan. Given the amount of data it holds on my intake of alcohol, calories and protein it could probably predict what I will die of, and when. Sharing it all back with me would meet a public good; aggregating it all anonymously so that public health experts could mine the data would be something bigger. You may object to the retention of any data, in which case you\u2019re objecting to the engine at the heart of modern retail; at least this way society shares the benefits. So a truly radical rethink of the supermarket would not start with a Giraffe or a coffee shop. It would start by asking what public benefit we could achieve if the selling expertise and data power of the supermarket were combined, in synergy, with the suppressed sociability of the buying public. Just as health insurers reward people for gym membership, society could reward supermarkets for achieving local health outcomes. You could incentivise the non-display of sugar-rich rubbish; expand the pharmacy section into a mini-walk-in clinic; and adopt \u2013 voluntarily instead of reluctantly \u2013 the clearest possible healthy eating label system. We should not idealise the pre-supermarket era. Yes, there were lots of tiny shops whose owners knew your name. But the suppliers had the power: the \u201cmilk marketing board\u201d, the local abattoir and grain wholesaler set food standards then \u2013 and for most people they were low. The relentless rise of food snobbery among my generation was only possible because Tesco, Sainsbury and Asda brought us organic chicken and tomato soup that no longer tasted of the tin it came in. So what happens next can\u2019t be a regression. There has to be a way of thinking \u2013 literally \u2013 outside of the giant box the retailers have constructed on the edge of every town. At the trendy edges of business theory there is actually a word, and a legal status, for the kind of company the reimagined supermarket might become: the public benefit corporation. But it would be a major change, especially for shareholders who have yet to abandon the view, formed by the experience of the 1990s and 2000s, that supermarkets are everlasting money trees. A supermarket whose relationship with suppliers was no longer oppressive and opaque; and which promoted health, sociability and healthy eating; whose social dynamics became more human; and whose data was managed in the public interest would be a different beast. It might not be very profitable \u2013 but then neither is the current model. Paul Mason is economics editor of Channel 4 News. Follow him @paulmasonnews",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Len Blavatnik, 57, who has topped this year\u2019s Sunday Times rich list, describes himself as \u201ca major American industrialist\u201d, but the personal and business roots of Britain\u2019s richest man are in the former USSR. The billionaire investor was born in Odessa, Ukraine, and the yacht he uses for lavish parties at the Cannes film festival is named after the city of his birth. Blavatnik is best known as the owner of the Warner Music Group, whose artists include Coldplay, and his holdings in online music streaming services including Spotify. The Warner-signed singer Ed Sheeran played at his daughter\u2019s batmitzvah. He made his money from the breakup of the energy and aluminium groups of the former Soviet Union. Blavatnik studied at Moscow State University then emigrated to the US in 1978, becoming a citizen in 1984. He studied computer science at Columbia in New York and then business at Harvard, graduating with an MBA in 1989, the year the Berlin wall fell. By the time the USSR was dissolving, he was showing signs of success as a businessman in the US with Access Industries, his holding company. He saw the opportunity of the post-Gorbachev reforms and started buying aluminium businesses in Russia, building a company that would eventually become part of Rusal, the world\u2019s largest aluminium producer, of which he is a director. Blavatnik and other partners, including the oligarch Mikhail Fridman (Blavatnik does not like being called an oligarch himself), then bought the Russian oil company TNK. It turned into one of his best investments as he sold his stake in what it became \u2013 TNK-BP \u2013 to Rosneft for $7bn in 2013. Throughout his dealings in Russia, during a period of often ruthless business rivalry, he stood out because of his US citizenship and connections. By contrast with Russian billionaires such as Boris Berezovsky and Mikhail Khordokovsky, Blavatnik did not present a political challenge to Vladimir Putin, said Dr Shamil Yenikeyeff, an Oxford academic who studied the battle for Russian oil in a 2011 report, having \u201cnever shown much interest in Russian politics\u201d. In 2004, he spent \u00a341m on property in Kensington Palace Gardens to create a lavish refurbished home on the exclusive central London street where Lakshmi Mittal, Blavatnik\u2019s predecessor at the top of the Sunday Times rich list, also has a house. Not long after came one of his boldest investments. LyondellBasell Industries, a Rotterdam and Texas-based chemical company originally put together by Blavatnik, went through bankruptcy in 2010 but, instead of walking away, he increased his stake when others were selling and its value skyrocketed. By last August, it had reportedly made Blavatnik an unrealised profit of $8bn. As the company\u2019s value increased, he moved on to other investments and Access paid $3.3bn for Warner Music Group in 2011, calculating, according to one associate, that the turmoil that had rocked the music industry was coming to an end and money was to be made again. \u201cHe is a very shrewd investor who has been willing to take bets,\u201d said the associate who indicated Blavatnik said little in meetings, preferring \u201cto listen rather than talk\u201d. His close friends include the publisher George Weidenfeld and Edgar Bronfman Jr, an heir to the Seagram distilling fortune and former chief executive of Warner Music Group. Blavatnik has expensive taste in art. He paid \u00a39m for Woolly Mammoth by Damien Hirst at a charity auction during the 2014 Cannes film festival and not long ago bought a Modigliani, Weidenfeld has been quoted as saying. He has also donated huge sums as a philanthropist. In 2010, he donated \u00a375m to Oxford University to build the Blavatnik School of Government, which has been designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, the Swiss architects behind Tate Modern. In 2013, he donated large sums to research into diseases, including $10m to Yale and $50m to Harvard.",

      "bodyText": "BP and Shell will this week report a collapse in first-quarter profits of around 60% on the same period of 2014 underlining the financial damage being inflicted by low oil and gas prices. Analysts predict BP will be hit the hardest, putting further pressure on chief executive, Bob Dudley, as he tries to steer the company back to full health amid continuing fallout from the Deepwater Horizon accident. A consensus of 22 analysts expect BP\u2019s underlying replacement \u201ccosts profits\u201d \u2013 an oil industry accounting measure that incorporates fluctuations in the price of oil \u2013 to be down to $1.3bn (\u00a3850m) from $3.2bn in the first three months of 2014. \u201cThere will be a huge drop in earnings for all the large integrated oil companies but especially BP. It will be the worst set of results for everyone since 2009,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, veteran analyst with the Oppenheimer brokerage in New York. Iain Armstrong, analyst with investment manager Brewin Dolphin in London, said BP would be most exposed to the particularly large fall in US natural gas prices slightly tempered by stronger refining margins. \u201cUpstream (exploration and production) earnings will be most affected, although there could be the initial positive impact of the planned cuts in capital expenditure and the ongoing layoff programme,\u201d said Armstrong. Gheit believes BP income could fall by as much as 70% while Shell will be down by 68% and Exxon Mobil by 67%. But he also predicts losses for the second tier of oil companies such as Anadarko Petroleum, Apache Corporation and ConocoPhillips. Gheit believes the \u201cdevastating\u201d losses of the oil sector will increase the likelihood of more merger and acquisition activity following the $70bn takeover plan unveiled earlier this month by Shell on BG. \u201cIt is a dog-eat-dog world out there now. Basically all companies are potential takeover targets. Tony Hayward [the ex-BP boss now running Genel Energy] said he is looking for acquisitions but I have news for him that his own company is being looked at.\u201d Gheit believes US domestic oil and gas producers will be the hardest hit with financial losses continuing throughout the year. \u201cIf there is not a bounce back (in oil prices) they could be even worse next year because they will not be so protected by a hedging strategy.\u201d The oil price over the first quarter of the financial year is roughly half the level that it was during the same period of 2014. It has since recovered slightly, with Brent blend last Friday trading at $65, 40% lower than the same time last year. BG will not report its financial results until 8 May but the annual general meeting three days earlier will see lively debate over management\u2019s decision to accept the takeover offer from Shell. All the oil companies have been slashing their capital expenditure and many have been laying off staff causing enormous concern in offshore centres such as Aberdeen.

The change comes following the December departure of chief executive Michael Jeffries \u2013 who took over in 1992 \u2013 after the company\u2019s shares fell by about 39% over the past 12 months. \u201cI believe now is the right time for new leadership to take the company forward in the next phase of its development,\u201d Jeffries said as he left. Christos Angelides, president of the Abercrombie brand, and Fran Horowitz, the Hollister brands head, are now looking to turn the company around by scrapping Jeffries\u2019s legacy \u2013 a \u201clook policy\u201d as well as the shirtless models. The death of the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch dress code and other changes are part of a plan to cater more to shoppers, the two presidents told Bloomberg, adding that for too long stores and clothes were tailored to Jeffries\u2019s whims. \u201cBy the end of July, there will no longer be sexualized marketing used in marketing materials, including in-store photos, gift cards and shopping bags,\u201d the company said in a statement on Friday. For now, the stores remain the same. On Saturday afternoon, an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City was darkly lit, like a nightclub. Music was pumping and the smell of cologne lingered in every nook and cranny. Inside, foreign tourists browsed, clearly oblivious to the changes that were coming. \u201cI\u2019m French,\u201d said one visitor, waving off questions. When pushed, she shrugged, saying it didn\u2019t matter to her if the store\u2019s employees were called models or brand representatives. The store\u2019s employees, however, seemed to care. \u201cI personally like [being called a brand representative], because I am not a model,\u201d one female employee said. Dressed in all black and wearing black eyeliner and mascara, she said she was excited about the new dress code, because it would allow for more freedom. One of the main reasons that the store\u2019s dress code had come under scrutiny was a US supreme court case in which Samantha Elauf, a job applicant, accused Abercrombie of religious discrimination. The hijab \u2013 which Elauf wore to a job interview \u2013 violated Abercrombie &amp; Fitch\u2019s \u201clook\u201d policy because it was black and because it was considered to be headwear, like a hat or a cap. As a result, Elauf received a one out of three rating for \u201cappearance and sense of style\u201d and was not offered the job. Since Elauf\u2019s job interview, which happened in 2008, the company has loosened its look policy to allow headscarves and for black clothing. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we weren\u2019t allowed to wear black,\u201d the female New York employee said. As of Friday, the company\u2019s entire look policy is officially dead. Gone with it are bans on French-tip manicures, un-natural highlights and facial hair. The four employees spotted at the store on Saturday were all female. The one monitoring customers coming and going at the front door was bundled up in a heavy winter jacket. Underneath, she wore a comfortable striped top and jeans. She said she too preferred the term \u201cbrand representative\u201d to \u201cmodel\u201d. Since there were no \u201cbeefcakes\u201d or bare chests in sight, the Guardian was unable to find out if any male employees were excited at the prospect of being allowed to grow a moustache.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s billionaires have seen their net worth more than double since the recession, with the richest 1,000 families now controlling a total of \u00a3547bn. While average UK incomes have yet to recover from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, with thousands still flocking to food banks, the financial elite have emerged not only with their fortunes intact, but holding a larger than ever slice of the cake. Their assets have increased from \u00a3258bn in 2009, a rise of more than 112%, according to the 2015 Sunday Times Rich List. The past 12 months saw the biggest bounce for the UK super-rich in six years, and London now has 80 billionaires, up from 72 last year \u2013 more than any other world city. Leading the pack for the first time is Ukrainian born petro-billionaire Len Blavatnik, whose London address is a \u00a341m residence in Kensington Palace Gardens. Now a US citizen, Blavatnik gambled a third of his fortune on acquiring the ailing Warner Music empire four years ago, at a time when piracy was demolishing recorded music revenues. The venture is beginning to pay off. Warner\u2019s revenues have bounced back, thanks to the burgeoning popularity of music streaming services. The overall estimate of Blavatnik\u2019s holdings, including stakes in aluminium and chemicals companies, property and cash, increased by \u00a33bn to a net \u00a313.17bn. His rise has pushed Indian automotive kings the Hinduja brothers into second place, despite a \u00a31.1bn increase in their reported wealth. In contrast to the soaring incomes of the richest, the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank says average household incomes have only recently recovered from the banking crash, leaving them no better off than in 2008. Median household income in the most recent financial year was at around the same level as it was in 2007\u201308 before the recession, though still more than 2% below its 2009\u201310 peak. The richest 1,000 families have more money than the poorest 40% of British households combined, according to the Equality Trust. Last year they saw their wealth increase by \u00a328bn, the equivalent of \u00a377m a day. The annual increase is enough to foot the nation\u2019s council tax bills for a year, provide nearly 2m living-wage jobs for a year or 1m jobs paid at the average full-time wage of \u00a327,195, said the trust. The director, Duncan Exley, commented: \u201cInequality at this scale is hugely damaging for society. Multiple studies show that living in a more unequal country means you\u2019re more likely to have poorer education, suffer from poor mental health, trust people less, be the victim of violent crime and even die earlier.\u201d Not all the rich are getting richer. The fall in demand for natural resources saw Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal drop down to seventh place. Worth an estimated \u00a31bn less than last year, he was among 2015\u2019s biggest fallers, as was Chealsea FC owner Roman Abramovich, whose fortune reportedly fell by \u00a31.23bn. Two UK business families were among the year\u2019s biggest gainers. Galen and George Weston, the British born Anglo-Canadians who own Selfridges department store and Associated British Foods, makers of Twinings and Ovaltine, shot into third place with a \u00a33.7bn rise. Meanwhile, Denise Coates and family, who control bookmakers Bet365, are thought to have doubled their holdings to \u00a32.35bn. Sir James Dyson and family jumped from 29th to joint 22nd place, with a \u00a3500m lift pushing their reported wealth to \u00a33.5bn. Dyson now holds 25,000 acres of land, having recently bought a 1,200-hectare (3,000-acre) estate in Lincolnshire, making him a bigger landlord than the Queen. Richard Branson returned to the top 20 with a reported \u00a3500m increase to \u00a34.1bn, thanks in part to rail: Virgin Trains won an extension on its west coast franchise and jointly secured the right to operate the east coast line. While homegrown fortunes are faring well, the Rich List remains dominated by entrepreneurs from outside the UK \u2013 just five of the top 20 fortunes are in the hands of British-born individuals. Attracted by ever increasing property prices and the non-dom laws which allow UK residents with foreign passports to shelter their offshore assets from tax, the world\u2019s super-rich are still flocking to London. Of the 117 billionaires who feature in the list, only 62 are British, and the Queen herself has now dropped out of the richest 300 for the first time.",

    "webTitle": "The innovators: mist system offers a safer way to control fires", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was during a brainstorming session with members of the white watch shift of Chelsea fire brigade that Yusuf Muhammad learned two guiding facts. He was unaware that fire extinguishers in high-rise housing blocks can act as a fire risk when people who should make their escape use them to fight the blaze. Muhammad also learned that firefighters occasionally spray a mist of water into a fire when they first arrive in order to bring the temperature down. Eight years later, what was a college project became the Automist system. With two colleagues, he designed a network of steel fixtures with nozzles connected to water supplies that are fixed either at the base of a tap in the kitchen or on to a wall. When a heat sensor is triggered, a dense fog of water mist emerges from the nozzles, suppressing the fire. When fitted, the Automist devices are connected to the mains water supply and activate when a heat alarm on the ceiling reaches 57C \u2013 which can be about one minute into a furniture fire. Water is then driven through the nozzles at high pressure, forming a mist or fog in a five-metre radius which reduces the heat from the flames and displaces oxygen, depriving the fire of its strength. The system sprays out the mist for 30 minutes after it is set off, unless it is turned off manually. \u201cOnce the pump activates, it drives water through our set of nozzles. The water is atomised to give that mist,\u201d Muhammad said. Chip-pan fires remain one of the most common causes of domestic blazes and fire brigades have consistently warned against using water to fight them. A sprinkler system is going to make things worse as water is heavier than oil and sinks to the bottom of a pan before vaporising, in turn spreading burning oil into the air. Plumis \u2013 the company behind Automist \u2013 says the fine water droplets in his system are small enough to instead be drawn into the flame and suppress the fire. The system has found favour among some homeowners who have extended their houses and found they need to comply with building regulations to make them safer. Cost, though, was an issue for other potential customers. While the product was being developed by Muhammad and his co-founders Alan Hart and William Makant , they found housing association budget constraints prevented them making the investment. The solution came from someone in the midst of a loft conversion who queried whether the system could be used to comply with fire regulations. \u201cAlthough the vast majority of fires start in the kitchen, there is a real need for sprinklers in domestic premises when you are trying to do things with building regulations,\u201d said Muhammad. \u201cFor example, if you would like to have an open plan ground floor on a three storey house, you can\u2019t do that because it can compromise the escape route. You can imagine if there is a fire in that open plan space and somebody is trying to escape from the top of the house to the bottom of the house, they have to go down the staircase and through that area,\u201d he said. \u201cThe traditional way to get around that is to have the lobby area or hallway separated from your kitchen and dining room. Otherwise, you have to put in a sprinkler system.\u201d It is here that Plumis found success. Building regulations dictate that some fire suppression system needs to be put in place, typically sprinklers, which in turn usually require more invasive construction. The founders say their system is less expensive and uses 10 times less water, meaning it does not need a large water storage system and can instead run off the mains. \u201cWe had a product which by mistake could be used to solve that problem,\u201d said Makant. The system in operation keeps \u201cconditions survivable\u201d in a fire so that people can escape, he says, and acts to reduce a blaze to a smaller size than when it started but does not claim to extinguish it. Now about 90% of the company\u2019s sales are for the wall-mounted mist systems, many of which are installed in converted homes in wealthy London suburbs such as Fulham. \u201cWe had thought up to that point that we had a business which was going to serve vulnerable people and housing associations. They were interested but said \u2018we are not going to buy it right now\u2019,\u201d he said. In response, Hart said: \u201cWe are saying it is not tap-mounted any more, it is going to be wall mounted primarily and it is going to solve building control problems rather than protect the vulnerable. \u201cAlthough the kitchen is a big source of fires, one of the things that we came to realise is that people will not spend money on fire protection unless they have to.\u201d As well as in more expensive homes, the systems are popular with developers of student accommodation and councils that must house vulnerable residents. Installed with one pump and one spraying device \u2013 which covers a room of up to 32 square metres \u2013 the system costs \u00a32,000. The company is now aiming to make headway with its next product \u2013 a misting system on a motor which aims a wall of water directly at a fire via a heat sensor \u2013 which they say will get 10 times more water on the flames than a uniform spray. With \u00a3900,000 of sales last year, Plumis recorded its first profit of \u00a3200,000 and intends to grow internationally \u2013 just 1% of sales are outside Britain \u2013 with the United States as the primary target. Prevention of arson The system has been used by Exeter city council in the home of a resident with mental health problems who repeatedlyset fire to his home. The man suffered three fires before officials fitted the misting device. When he tried to start a fire again, the system activated. He damaged it out of frustration. Nonetheless, says the company, the spray operated as it should have and prevented a fire.

      "body": "<p>It was during a brainstorming session with members of the white watch shift of Chelsea fire brigade that Yusuf Muhammad learned two guiding facts.<br tabindex=\"-1\">He was unaware that fire extinguishers in high-rise housing blocks can act as a fire risk when people who should make their escape use them to fight the blaze. Muhammad also learned that firefighters occasionally spray a mist of water into a fire when they first arrive in order to bring the temperature down.</p> <p>Eight years later, what was a college project became the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.plumis.co.uk/automist.html\">Automist system</a>. With two colleagues, he designed a network of steel fixtures with nozzles connected to water supplies that are fixed either at the base of a tap in the kitchen or on to a wall. When a heat sensor is triggered, a dense fog of water mist emerges from the nozzles, suppressing the fire.</p> <p>When fitted, the Automist devices are connected to the mains water supply and activate when a heat alarm on the ceiling reaches 57C \u2013 which can be about one minute into a furniture fire. Water is then driven through the nozzles at high pressure, forming a mist or fog in a five-metre radius which reduces the heat from the flames and displaces oxygen, depriving the fire of its strength. The system sprays out the mist for 30 minutes after it is set off, unless it is turned off manually. </p> <p>\u201cOnce the pump activates, it drives water through our set of nozzles. The water is atomised to give that mist,\u201d Muhammad said.</p> <p>Chip-pan fires remain one of the most common causes of domestic blazes and fire brigades have consistently warned against using water to fight them. A sprinkler system is going to make things worse as water is heavier than oil and sinks to the bottom of a pan before vaporising, in turn spreading burning oil into the air. Plumis \u2013 the company behind Automist \u2013 says the fine water droplets in his system are small enough to instead be drawn into the flame and suppress the fire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"262f92888ec310521131ceaf3c2e35b57d4071e9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/26/1430056354151/3975c176-d8f8-41ba-8028-2a90e0a7720e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Chip pans are one of the most common causes of domestic fires.

      "bodyText": "The political motivation for Ed Miliband\u2019s pledge to peg private-sector rents to inflation is simple. Britain used to be a nation of home owners but is becoming a nation of renters. For many young people, the dream of buying their own home is dying. In the past 15 years, a century-long upward trend in owner-occupation has gone into reverse. Almost 70% of homes were owner occupied at the turn of the millennium; today the figure is below 64%, a marked decline in such a short time. Buy-to-let landlords can find tenants because young people cannot afford a deposit to buy unless they inherit money or are given a helping hand by parents cashing in the capital gains on their properties. Only 43% of 25 to 34-year-olds had a mortgage in 2011-12 compared to 67% 20 years earlier. The trend is particularly marked in London, but young people are also being frozen out of the market in other parts of the country. As Miliband noted when interviewed by Andrew Marr, there are 11 million tenants in private rented accommodation. In a tight election, their votes could be crucial \u2013 especially in London. Labour and the Tories know about the changing balance between renting and owner-occupation. Both have come up with proposals for doing something about it. Both are really sticking-plaster solutions. David Cameron\u2019s idea involves extending the right-to-buy scheme to the 1.3 million housing association tenants. Housing associations will be compensated for the loss of their properties by local authorities, which will be forced to sell off their most expensive homes. The proceeds will also be used to replenish the stock of social housing. The Institute for Fiscal Studies expressed doubts about this proposal last week, noting that there were uncertainties about the money that could be raised from selling expensive properties, the bill for providing discounts to HA tenants and the cost of replacement properties. \u201cGiven this uncertainty, and the coalition\u2019s less-than-impressive record in delivering replacement social housing under the existing right to buy, there is a risk that these policies will lead to a further depletion in the social housing stock, something the proposal explicitly seeks to avoid.\u201d Doubtless, the IFS will have something equally sniffy to say about Labour\u2019s proposal when it gets round to publishing its assessment in the coming days. That\u2019s because it fails to address the root of the problem of high rents: the mismatch between growing demand for homes and the lack of supply. Labour\u2019s plans for rent controls will be welcomed by those tenants who feel they are being ripped off by their landlords, but to the extent that they restrict supply they will have similar effect as the Conservative plans. The sad truth is that housing policy in Britain is asinine and cowardly. It is asinine because at every turn politicians have made worse the imbalance between demand and supply. It has been cowardly because they have known full well that housing policy is biased in favour of the haves rather than the have nots, but they fear the wrath of those who have already done nicely out of rising property prices. But the stupidity and the cowardice come with a price. A housing crisis has been brewing for the past four decades and could blow at any time. It is a crisis of homelessness, of over-crowding, of sleeping rough and of thwarted hopes. Problems first started to surface at the start of the 1970s, with the easing of controls on credit. Before that, credit rationing and a bipartisan policy of building more homes kept demand and supply in balance. Squalor was one of the five giants barring the road to progress identified by the Beveridge report in 1942, but the idea that everybody was entitled to a decent home was part of the post-war consensus. More council homes built under the Conservatives in the 1950s than in any other decade. Private housebuilding also increased in the post-war period and rising prosperity meant that by the early 1970s there were more owner-occupiers than renters. Since then, though supply has never kept pace with demand, with the result that there have been tsunamis of property inflation in the early 1970s, the late 1980s and the mid 2000s. A paper by Christian Hilber of the London School of Economics lays out what has happened in stark terms. Over the past 40 years, the UK has seen house prices rise by more than other country in the rich-nation Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. London is a more expensive city than New York, Hong Kong, Singapore or Paris. In fact, it is more expensive than anywhere apart from the millionaire\u2019s playground of Monaco. Not many new homes are being built in the UK but those that are being completed are 40% smaller than in other European countries that are similarly densely populated. The supply of new homes has been limited by tough green belt restrictions, planning laws, the squeeze on local government finance and nimbyism. Demand has increased as a result of a generous tax system for property owners, a rising population and net migration. The mismatch between demand and supply is most pronounced in London, and that is why property is monstrously expensive. The price to income ratio in London is 8.5:1. Hilber says the UK has an affordability crisis caused by the strictures of the planning system. He has some suggestions for what might be done, including easing changing the planning laws to free up parts of the green belt, financial incentives to persuade local authorities to build, and the replacement of the council tax and stamp duty land tax with a new local property tax with automatic annual revaluations. \u201cThe obstacles to moving to such policies are vast since these policies antagonise vested interests, which appear to have been created in perpetuity. But the long-run consequences of political inaction \u2013 and the continuation of excessively low rates of new building \u2013 could prove socially explosive and economically traumatic.\u201d Hilber is right. The social costs of the housing crisis are rising all the time but the fear of a backlash from owner-occupiers means the policy response is inadequate. No, make that counter-productive, given that in the past five years two flagship government policies \u2013 Funding for Lending and Help to Buy \u2013 have increased demand at a time when fewer houses have been built than under any administration since the second world war. But the basic laws of demand and supply operate. If demand is strong and supply is weak, prices go up. Governments can respond by liberalising planning laws, building more homes, making the tax system less generous, pursuing active regional policies to ease the pressure on London, or by putting curbs on migration. All are difficult, some controversial. But at present, Labour and Conservatives are attacking symptoms not causes. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a crisis and why there will eventually be a crash.",

      "bodyText": "This is an appeal to the idealists, the dreamers, the hankerers after a new, sunny kind of British politics, where the spending axe is buried and a thousand flowers bloom. Please don\u2019t be beguiled into throwing away your vote. Watching the seven-strong leaders\u2019 debate, which already seems an age ago, anyone on the left found it heart-warming to see the economic argument being turned upside down. Instead of starting from the grim necessity of deficit reduction, the Greens\u2019 Natalie Bennett, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Leanne Wood and the SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon rejected austerity, and instead prioritised human decency and fairness. The Oxford academic Simon Wren-Lewis pointed out in a piece for the New Statesman last week that the Conservatives have been incredibly successful at redefining the purpose of economic policy as deficit reduction. \u201cIf you asked any economist what the aim of government policy should be,\u201d Wren-Lewis wrote, \u201che or she would probably say it was to increase the welfare of the public, or ... to raise standards of living.\u201d The decision to fetishise deficit reduction has not only failed \u2013 the Tories promised to eliminate it, and instead have cut it in half, only as a share of GDP \u2013 it has also, Wren-Lewis reckons, been extremely costly, and not just for the economy. Listening to Ed Balls\u2019s masochistic, iron chancellor mood music, it is tempting to conclude that Labour is fighting on precisely the same ground as the Tories: for fiscal prudence and against irresponsibility; for the hawks in the City and against the benefit-scroungers. Which is why the Greens and the SNP have seemed like a breath of fresh air, exposing the other parties\u2019 mean-spiritedness, and lifting the debate above the tired old bickering about black holes and tax bombs. But the SNP are deceiving the electorate, and the Greens are deceiving themselves. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 analysis showed last week, the SNP\u2019s plans, which involve increasing public spending by 0.5% a year in real terms, while promising to reverse some of the Tories\u2019 welfare cuts, are no more generous than Labour\u2019s. In fact, the SNP would still be cutting spending by 2019-20, leaving public spending in that year lower than under Labour. As the IFS\u2019s Gemma Tetlow pointed out, this seems to be \u201csomewhat at odds\u201d with Sturgeon\u2019s rhetoric. As for the Greens, their involvement in the debates has been refreshing indeed. The party has some practical and perfectly implementable plans, for improving energy efficiency by insulating the nation\u2019s homes, for example. But their tax and spending plans involve some absolutely heroic assumptions. The IFS has questioned Labour\u2019s ambition to raise \u00a37.5bn from a crackdown on tax evasion; the Greens would bank on making \u00a330bn from this \u2013 in addition to the \u00a325bn a year they would hope to raise by the end of the parliament from a new wealth tax. The principles are sound: wealth, in particular property wealth, is arguably undertaxed in Britain. But that figure of \u00a325bn looks hopelessly overambitious. And \u00a330bn is almost a fifth of the entire amount raised from income tax each year. So while Sturgeon\u2019s anti-austerity, anti-establishment rhetoric is little more than a pose, Bennett\u2019s promises amount to fantasy economics. And don\u2019t be fooled by Balls\u2019s posturing either. As the IFS confirmed last Thursday, the two main parties\u2019 tax and spending plans put them further apart than at any general election since 1992. The electorate faces a clear choice. George Osborne\u2019s pledge to eliminate the entire deficit by 2018-19 requires an extra \u00a312bn reduction in welfare spending, and \u00a330bn of additional cuts in Whitehall departments\u2019 budgets. Given how aggressively the government has already sought out savings over the past five years, it\u2019s hard to see how either of those goals could be achieved without a fundamental reshaping of the state. Further deep cuts of the size Osborne is contemplating would also imperil a fragile economic recovery. In reality, the Conservatives\u2019 cuts look so impossible that a Tory government would probably end up having to increase taxes: the IFS reckons taxes rise by an average of \u00a35bn in the 12 months after a general election. And given that one of their flagship manifesto promises is to cut inheritance tax for some of the country\u2019s wealthiest homeowners, at a time when Britain faces a desperate housing crisis, it\u2019s unlikely that equity will be top of Osborne\u2019s mind when he decides where the burden should fall. Labour, by contrast, needs to find what the IFS described as a \u201cmere\u201d \u00a31bn or so more in cuts to meet its more modest budget pledges. Ed Miliband may wear a dark suit and live in north London, but he\u2019s in a radically different political place from the Conservatives, even before you take into account Labour\u2019s promises to increase the tax burden on the rich; get rid of zero-hours contracts; give employees a say on executive pay; and protect tax credits. Sturgeon, Bennett and Wood have energised the economic debate over the past three weeks; but unless Labour forms the next government, they can do absolutely nothing to protect Britain from another savage round of cuts.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a big week for big oil, with both BP and Royal Dutch Shell reporting results. Despite crude prices hitting a 2015 high at the end of last week, they are still almost 50% down since last June, which means continuing trouble for the businesses. BP is expected to see a 60% drop in first-quarter operating profits to $2.1bn (\u00a31.4bn), according to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale analysts. There could also be costs relating to BP cancelling rigs during the quarter, while SocGen is estimating an increase in Deepwater Horizon liabilities from $468m in the fourth quarter to $550m. Shell net income could fall 49% to $2.29bn, say analysts at Bernstein. BP has also been tipped as a possible takeover target in the wake of Shell\u2019s \u00a342bn deal to buy BG, with investment bank Liberum saying \u201cBP appears on the chess board as one of the few remaining sizeable potential targets for a large synergistic deal in a low-price environment\u201d. ExxonMobil is the obvious predator for BP, though regulatory issues, the hefty cost of any deal and increased exposure to Russia mean many in the City dismiss the idea out of hand. Meanwhile, BP could also be put on the spot about its commitment to being more open about its impact on climate change, after 98% of shareholders at its recent annual meeting called for more transparency. The company agreed to publish more information, but stepped back from providing targets to curb its own greenhouse gas output. Eastern promise for Virgin and Stagecoach Anyone arriving at London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross station at the moment cannot fail to notice that Virgin Trains is now running the previously nationalised east coast service \u2013 its adverts plaster much of the available space. The performance of the joint venture between Virgin and Stagecoach \u2013 a partnership that already runs the west coast service \u2013 will be highlighted this week when Stagecoach issues a trading update for the fourth quarter. Analysts believe the east coast will be a long-term winner for Stagecoach. Nomura says: \u201cThe east coast rail franchise \u2026 is expected to contribute to growth of 50% in the company\u2019s rail revenue in 2016. A successful bid for the TransPennine Express [franchise, due to be announced by October] would lead to further significant increases. We believe that the company\u2019s bidding strategy is proving effective, and weexpect continued solid performance from the rail business.\u201d The company\u2019s bus operations are also performing well, but there are uncertainties over bus and rail until the outcome of the election is known. Rival Go-Ahead also reports this week, with the focus on its Thameslink franchise after teething problems and unexpectedly high startup costs. Apple Watch ticks boxes for City analysts Apple Watch has only just launched, but analysts are cautiously optimistic about its success. UBS said its eventual importance to the company may be as an interface to the much-mooted internet of things: \u201cFor now, it [the watch] is a nice-to-have; later it may be a must-have.\u201d It admitted that the watch seemed about a third as popular as the iPad and half as popular as the iPhone at launch, which would be disappointing. But UBS is still forecasting sales of 36m units in the first year and 40m in 2016. Meanwhile, the success of the iPhone 6 is likely to mean a near-24% rise in second-quarter revenues to $56.5bn when Apple reports figures tomorrow, according to analysts at Bernstein. The bank reckons that Apple shipped 59.6m iPhones during the quarter, and said the Watch seemed to have higher margins than forecast. Apple is also expected to increase its dividend, said Bernstein, perhaps by 20% or more, and could unveil a new share repurchase programme, of $80bn or so, to the end of 2017. It may also unveil new services at its developer conference in June. These reportedly include, according to Morgan Stanley, \u201ca streaming music service and/or a new Apple TV set-top box with cable and broadcast TV content packages, an App Store, and/or a HomeKit [allowing for integration with third-party smarthome appliances]. We believe Apple could also announce new partnerships relating to HealthKit, ResearchKit, Carplay, or Apple Pay.\u201d",
