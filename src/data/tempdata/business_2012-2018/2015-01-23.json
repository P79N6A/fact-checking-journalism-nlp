      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s Jill Treanor with the full story of will.i.am\u2019s trip to WEF: William Adams, better known as will.i.am, has come to Davos after being named as one of the young global leaders by the World Economic Forum where the subject of inequality has been high on the agenda. Oxfam used the event to highlight that top 1% will control more wealth than the remaining 99% by next year.The singer producer, entrepreneur and judge on BBC1\u2019s the voice has been asked about what it like to be rich. He said \u201cI remember what it feels like to stand in the welfare line\u201d. \u201dI never really looked at myself as a 1% because I was always poor. I need to go back and tell kids in the neighbourhood that what they tell you on the news about the 1% is that there\u2019s not like a wall there that you can\u2019t be part of it,\u201d. He said that while some companies \u201cdon\u2019t give a shit about anybody\u201d there were some that did. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of companies that care, there\u2019s a lot of billionaires that care, there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to go from here to there\u201d. He came to Davos, he said, to give his perspective on the balance between the private sector and public sector. The 39-year-old backs the i.am.Angel foundation which provides scholarships and mentoring for school children. \u201cThere\u2019s a private sector for prisons but not for education....there\u2019s an imbalance between opportunities in inner cities around computer science engineers, mathematics and prisons. I hurts my heart and my soul that there is such a thing as private investment angle in prisons in America and not education. It\u2019s a human rights issue\u201d. And that\u2019s time to wrap up for the day. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow for the final day of WEF. Thanks and goodnight. GW Events at Davos have concluded with a press conference with William Adams, known to millions as will.i.am. The singer, song-writer, producer and philanthropist was discussing his charitable work. He\u2019s been in Davos this week, lobbying business leaders about the importance of training young people. We\u2019ll have the full story shortly.... The US State Department has confirmed what John Kerry told Davos earlier - that he will be visiting Nigeria, on Sunday. He\u2019ll be meeting the current leader, Goodluck Jonathan, and his rival -- and former head of state -- Muhammadu Buhari. The New York Times reported today that the rise of Boko Haram is driving voters to support Buhari: Boisterous crowds packed the streets for the retired general, while young men climbed lampposts, walls and billboards to glimpse his gaunt face. Others danced on careening motorcycles, brandishing homemade brooms, symbols of his campaign. With Nigeria\u2019s presidential election only weeks away, Boko Haram\u2019s unchecked rampaging here in the country\u2019s north is helping to propel the 72-year-old general, Muhammadu Buhari, to the forefront...... To Loosen Boko Haram\u2019s Grip, Nigerian Voters Look to Ex-Leader Who Ruled With Iron Hand Smartphones can also empower women in the developing world, Melinda adds. First because they can be cheaper to run than old plastic phones, and second because if their husband is working in another town he can send money to her electronically. Is it better to give financial support to women rather than men in the developing world? Melinda Gates says it is: Research suggest that for every marginal dollar you give a woman she\u2019s 90% likely to plough it back into her family. So if you empower that woman, you empower everything else. There are three priorities, giving a woman access to health care, decision-making powers in her household, and economic opportunity. Education is also crucial. Research shows that, for an educated woman in the developing world, there is 50% more chance that their child survives the early years and it\u2019s twice as likely that she\u2019ll educated her daughter. There\u2019s then a cringe-worthy moment as the moderator asks whether the Gates\u2019 share their economic resources. Joint cheque book, guys? Bill and Melinda let it go. Melinda Gates is explaining how progress has been made in vaccine to reduce deaths from diarrhea, pneumonia, etc. A package of vaccines costing $30 can protect a child from a group of diseases, and underpin the local health system. Rwanda has the biggest drop in childhood mortality in the history of the world, she adds, because of its vaccination programme. Bill chips in too \u2013 explaing how technology is helping too. Vaccines are being shipped in specially designed thermoses so they are kept cool enough until they reach patients. There\u2019s a couple of events still happening in Davos tonight, including Bill and Melinda Gates discussing Sustainable Development Goals. Here\u2019s a feed: That was quite a speech from John Kerry, desperately depressing in parts too, when he touched on the way young people are suffering from religious extremism (highlights start here) The broad pitch to Davos, and the watching world, was for a new long-term global commitment to fighting the conditions that allowed Daesh/ISIS, Boko Haram et al to thrive, as well as these terror groups themselves. By targeting the \u2018very environments from which these movements grow\u201d, Kerry has set the tone of the debate ahead of the White House conference next month. And you couldn\u2019t accuse Kerry of holding back, when he described terror groups as \u201ca form of criminal anarchy, a nihilism, which illegitimately claims an ideological &amp; religious foundation.\u201d There was also a welcome acknowledgement that economic inequality is another factor driving extremism - shared prosperity can help push it back. And he also emphasised that winning will be expensive. So, stirring talk, but was there much action? Well, Kerry set ejecting Daesh, the Islamic extremists holding parts of Iraq, as a key priority. And it\u2019s also significant that he will be heading to Nigeria soon; elections are taking place next month, under the shadow of the Boko Haram uprising. Thirdly, Kerry also made a determined effort not to label all extremists as \u201cIslamic\u201d, telling Davos that it is wrong to blame Muslims generally for the crimes and massacres being perpetrated. Rounding up, secretary of state Kerry returns to the Nigerian girl and Syrian boy who chose live over death when choosing not to blow themselves and others up. We must follow their example, he says, and take the steps he\u2019s outlined in this speech. And he reiterates that he remains optimistic. Some people say the entire system is unravelling. I see just the opposite - countries are negotiating trade deals, fighting ebola, helping Ukraine, moving towards a climate change deal. We have fought harder fights before, and won, Kerry declares. We are the descendants of those who survives plague, tyranny, the Holocaust. Now it\u2019s our turn to stand up for our values and the rule of law, and take the images of Paris and Peshawar in our hearts. And with that, Kerry gets a somewhat louder and longer round of applause than the other speakers I\u2019ve caught this week. Fighting inequality is another crucial step, says Kerry. Vital to increase education opportunities for girls around the world, and to address youth unemployment. We can move from talk to action at the White House summit in February, says Kerry. And it will be expensive. Just like the Second World War was. We have spent trillions in Iraq in the decade since we went to war there, Kerry says. And he adds: Just imagine if we\u2019d saved trillions in a battle we didn\u2019t have to fight for one we have to fight. Hard truth is that too many people in too many places feel trapped, says John Kerry. And he sums up how this can lead them to extremism. As one person put it to Kerry\u2019s State Department: The terrorists oppress us, the police rob us, the government ignores us and the west doesn\u2019t acknowledge us or wants to kill us Only a long-term, comprehensive approach can stop these extremist groups growing. Military action is only part of the solution. Kerry explains how groups start by paying young people a little to join them, then brainwash them, then send them our to recruit others. This fight will not be decided on the battlefield, but in the classrooms, workplaces, places of worship of the world. Kerry concedes that it is hard to make thrilling films about the merits of parliamentary democracy or effective public services. But, exciting or not, uncoverned or undergoverned places become a breeding ground for terrorism. And weak governments, who cannot rule effectively or who are so corrupt that they attract fighters determined to eject them, are another part of the problem. But it\u2019s about more than the Middle East, Kerry says, citing Yemen and Nigeria as other countries suffering from extremism, There is nowhere you can leave as an ungoverned state. And there is no place for negotiation. Eliminating the terrorists who confront us today is only part of the solution to stopping the endless cycle. Freeing Iraq from its Daesh occupiers are the crucial first step in winning the war against extremism, Kerry says. He\u2019s running through recent successes - military attacks and clampdown on their finances. After years of delay, Baghdad recently agreed oil supply deals, and its army is strengthening. But this success is not irreversible. The momentum has been slowed, but not stopped. The worst thing we could do to address the rise of Islamic extremism would be to blame all Muslims for these crimes, Kerry says. We are making strides against extremism, Kerry pledges. Like those who marcher in Paris, we must act as one. Kerry tells another awful story, of the Peshawar school massacre where attackers slaughted a class of young children. In minutes, a scene of peace and education turned into death and destruction, with\u201dsmall lifeless bodies\u201d littering the ground. And when their teacher returned, and was challenged by the assassins, she said I am their mother. That was her last words, Kerry says. There are no rounds of history, religion, politics, economic disadvantage or personal ambition that caa defend the slaughter of children. None.  We cannot stop violent extremism without understanding what\u2019s driving it, Kerry tells Davos. We can\u2019t change minds without knowing what\u2019s in them , Despite the conflict in the world, I remain optimistic, says Kerry. Then he runs through a terrible list of examples of the state of the world today: He cites a 14 year old Nigerian girl discovered in a crowded marketplace, with explosives strapped to body - but she refused to pull the tab, saving her life and others. Another potential suicide bomber, a Syrian boy, showed security guards he had a bomb tied to him but he didn\u2019t want to die. A third escaped from religious extremists, after finding the promises made to him were false. Those three examples represent the most basic choice - between death and life, between destroying and building. Kerry also cites Boko Haran videos have shown fighters saying shootings and violence will be their religion. John Kerry begin by saying he was saddened to hear of the death of Saudi King Abdullah, who died overnight. He played an important role in the fight against extremism, Kerry says. Will miss his partnership and friendship. Coming up... US secretary of state John Kerry is due to give a special address to Davos.... Back in the financial world, US stock markets have opened lower. No eurozone QE boost across the Atlantic today. Poor company results appear to be behind the falls. Fast-food chain McDonald\u2019s said sales in 2014 dropped by 7% and annual profits plunged by 15%. Dow Jones: -0.3% at 17,760.52 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,060.73 French president Francois Hollande has called on business leaders attending the World Economic Forum in Davos to help fight terrorism. Speaking some two weeks after the Paris attacks that gripped the world and mobilised France, Hollande said the financial world could help by choking off the illegal trafficking mechanisms used to fund terror networks I call on the financial system to ensure that the sources of terrorist funding are dried up. That we fight tax evasion and money-laundering. Don\u2019t leave it too late. The fight against terrorism must be global, he added, divided between states and companies, especially large ones, who must do what they can, he added. In a wide-ranging speech, the French president hailed the support shown by the world since the Charlie Hebdo and grocery store attacks. France, he said, would be at the forefront of the terrorism fight \u2013 reiterating his earlier pledge on this issue. Prosperity and security are interlinked. Climate change also featured in his speech; the challenge of the 21st century, as he called it. Hollande tried to bolster support for December\u2019s Climate Conference in Paris, warning that businesses must help provide the funding to break the world\u2019s dependency on fossil fuels. We cannot treat the earth as a commodity any more, he argued On economics, I fear Hollande\u2019s speech may not have pleased viewers in Berlin. He welcomed the ECB\u2019s new stimulus package, arguing that it gives flexibility for a new approach on growth. Germany\u2019s fear that eurozone members will slacken up on economic reforms may have been fanned..... And curiously, Hollande argued that the $1.1trn QE programme announced yesterday is a sign of ECB success in repressing inflation, rather than a response to the threat of deflation..... Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC\u2019s general secretary, is not impressed with George Osborne\u2019s earlier performance at Davos, describing the Chancellor as complacent. George Osborne\u2019s complacency in Davos about the state of the British economy may come back to haunt him. His remarks were notable for what he left out, rather than what he said. He failed to address the plain need for investment to shore up the real economy or to create the skilled, well-paid jobs young people in particular need. And he did not even mention the need to ensure that the rewards of growth are shared more fairly if Britain\u2019s economy is to become sustainable. George Soros may now recognise the need for inclusive growth to tackle inequality. The other George apparently does not. AM That was a powerful speech, I enjoyed it, says one delegate as we squeeze our way out of the hall. Hollande wraps up by repeating his earlier point that business and politicians must work together to fight climate change. And that\u2019s the end. Warm applause, but unfortunately no Q&amp;A session. Summary to follow. The French president returns to the Paris attacks earlier this week. We cannot accept attacks on Jews because they are Jews, or attacks on Muslims because they are Muslims. There is no greater pride for the president of the French Republic than to see the world offer its support, he continues. So many world leaders standing with us. Surely only in France would we se so many people on the streets...four million people...not demonstrating against something but in favour of how France is today. France must also be a major economic power - no political power without economic power. So the economy must be a major factor in security. There cannot be prosperity without security. So we have shared interest, and show responsibility. The economy is not there just to create wealth but to redistribute wealth, he insists. That\u2019s rather socialist for Davos.... President Hollande has welcomed the European Central Bank\u2019s new quantitative easing programme, but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s quite grasped why it happened. The new stimulus programme is a \u201cvery important step to inject liquidity into the markets\u201d he says. And the European Central Bank can do it because it has achieved its objective of limiting inflation. With inflation close to zero it can make more money available [Up to a point.... the ECB\u2019s target is actually inflation just below 2%, not -0.2%. And it is the threat of deflation that forced the ECB\u2019s hand] Anyway, Hollande\u2019s view is that the ECB\u201ds huge money-printing scheme \u201ccompels\u201d Europe to be more daring as it reduces the barriers to growth and unemployment. And he says France will make structural reforms, with more incentive to create competition and labour market reforms. Inequality between countries and within countries is the biggest problem facing the global economy today. We need investment in infrastructure....Europe must not lag behind. He welcomes Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s investment plan. Onto economics, and Hollande makes two indisputable points - growth is too low and unemployment is too high (both particularly in France, of course) Ukraine, and the Middle East crisis, are weighing on confidence and growth. Fighting global warming is going to be expensive, Hollande warns, and businesses will have to share the cost. We need to find \u20ac90bn for a Green Fund, that will ensure global temperatures only rise by 2 degrees this decade. And he\u2019s now calling for a huge investment in Green technologies to create a Green economy. Businesses need a predictable carbon price if they are to plan ahead, Hollande points out (two years ago, Europe\u2019s carbon pricing scheme hit serious problems) Hollande turns to climate, declaring that \u201cWe need to fight global warning. \u201c It is vital that December\u2019s Climate conference in Paris delivers an agreement to fight climate change. This is the major challenge of the 21st century. The time is past when human kind thought it could draw on unlimited resources. The Earth is not a commodity, a source of revenue. It is a shared asset we must protect and care for. We\u2019re heading into a post-carbon world where we cannot keep relying on fossil fuels.... Speaking directly to the delegates at Davos, Hollande urges these business leaders to help. I call on the financial system to ensure that the sources of terrorist funding are dried up. That we fight tax evasions and money-laundering. Don\u2019t leave it too late. And I call on all business to help the most fragile states, in a spirit of solidarity. France has values that we want to share with the whole world, Hollande says. To do that, we must fight the illicit flows which are funding terrorism. Europe must strengthen border controls, to identify terrorists. We need a passenger identity register to protect our future. Must make sure Internet is not used for hatred and violence, Must invest in cyber defence. Businesses, including the largest corporations, also have a responsibility to act to fight terrorism, he explains. France has waited too long to address the causes of terrorism, he says. France is in a broad coalition to support those in Iraq who are in the front line against ISIS. We will on the ground more than ever in Africa to help...France cannot do everything, France cannot act alone. Wherever it can do, it will. But we need international co-operations. Hollande cites militant Islam, Al-Queda, Boko Haram, as terrorist threats. Terrorism fuels itself through all kinds of illicit trafficking - drugs, weapons, human beings. The internet is being used as a weapon by terrorists, he says. Hollande begins by passing on his own condolences to the Saudi Royal Family. And then he moves onto the Paris terrorist attacks. For three days, we faced with dignity a huge challenge. The rest of Europe fully understood what was at stake. Freedom, liberty, the very foundations of our society were under attack. All countries in the world are vulnerable to terrorism. We must all prepare, because our main duty is to provide clarity and clear mindedness. And we\u2019re off. Davos founder Klaus Schwab is introducing president Hollande now. I was incredibly impressed by the exemplary response and solidarity of the French people to the Paris terrorist attacks, Schwab says. Europe needs a strong and confident France as it looks for a path to growth, and offers opportunities to all. One lesson of Paris attacks is that we must support the weakest and youngest who can otherwise fall into the hands of those who want to cause chaos and harm. Finally, Schwab reminds us that there is a crucial Climate Change conference in Paris in December. Coming next..... Francois Hollande\u2019s special address to Davos. The main hall has filled up ready. It was supposed to start 10 minutes ago, having been rescheduled from this morning after the King of Jordan cancelled his appearance and flew home following the deal of Saudi King Abdullah. The video of Emma Watson\u2019s appearance at a Davos breakfast event this morning is available. She was speaking about gender inequality in her capacity as a goodwill ambassador for UN Women. AM The business blog\u2019s very own Graeme Wearden has emerged from the main conference centre in Davos to capture a snap of this piper. As the Guardian\u2019s Jill Treanor reported earlier in our Davos diary: A light shower of snow is falling on Davos at the start of the third day of the annual World Economic Forum, so spare a thought for the piper outside the \u201cchalet\u201d occupied by Aberdeen Asset Management, just along from the Belvedere. Chilly business. Read the full diary here. AM Greek shares are leading European stock markets higher following Thursday\u2019s big quantitative easing unveil. The huge dose of medicine for the eurozone\u2019s sickly economy has put European shares on course for their biggest weekly gain in more than three years. The FTSE 100 is also heading for its biggest weekly rise in more than three years (although it is currently underperforming other indices, up just 0.2% on the day). The Greek ATG share index is up almost 6%, with shares in Attica Bank, National Bank of Greece, and Piraeus Bank up sharply. Greece will be eligible for the ECB\u2019s bond-buying programme, but subject to stricter conditions because of its EU/IMF bailout arrangements. Traders appear to be shrugging off the potential impact of a Syriza victory at Sunday\u2019s Greek election. It seems they are hopeful that the radical left, anti-austerity party would be willing to reach a compromise with the country\u2019s lenders if they win, rather than lead Greece out of the euro altogether. The panel ends with two points on currencies. Osborne tries to calm fears that UK exporters will suffer from the weaker euro: While George Soros, the billionaire who knows the currency markets like the back of his limo, says the breaking of the Swiss franc peg against the euro was inevitable. Indeed, he\u2019d have predicted it if he was still in the money-making game. Switzerland now faces an uncompetitive currency and a slowing economy. And that\u2019s the end of the session on Europe\u2019s future (highlights start here) George Osborne rarely lets a chance for political point-scoring go past. Asked about the rise of non-mainstream political parties, Osborne says it\u2019s Labour\u2019s fault. A political system is a reflection of hopes and fears of the people in the country, Labour has not provided an answer to the tough decisions we\u2019ve taken, so people who are unhappy are looking to other parties. But when it comes to a general election, people move back to mainstream parties who they trust, he added. Back to George Soros, who urges Europe to give Ukraine more financial support to cope with the violence in its eastern regions. Europe is not sufficiently aware of the danger posed by a resurgent Russia, he says..... there is an assault on the very foundations of the values that Europe is based on. Greece cannot get help from Europe\u2019s new QE scheme unless it is in a reform programme, German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble declares. Asked about Sunday\u2019s general election, he says he will wait for the Greek people to decide who should govern them. But I\u2019ve seen two Greek elections (in 2012) where the people decided to stick with what has to be done, he says. Unlike many economists, Schauble is not recognising that Greece\u2019s debts may be so high that a restructuring is inevitable. Schauble also denies that Greece\u2019s current plight is the fault of Europe, or Brussels, or Berlin. The reason for the problems of the Greek people are the mistake in the past. But what about the claim by opposition leader Alexis Tsipras that Greece is being subjected to \u201cfiscal waterboarding\u201d? That is political campaigning, Schauble replies. You can like it or not like it. I don\u2019t like it. Wolfgang Schauble is challenged about a report in the Der Spiegel newspaper that Angela Merkel has looked at a plan for Greece to leave the eurozone. Schauble tried to sweep it aside: If I cared about what was in the media I would never get by job done in 48 hours a day. Pressed on this, he replies: We don\u2019t model any exit. Have struggling Eurozone countries done enough to persuade German taxpayers to show solidarity? Spanish finance minister Luis de Guindos says that Europe has loaned \u20ac210bn to Greece, including \u20ac26bn from Spain. Our exposure to Greece is \u20ac26bn. As much as our bill on unemployment benefits. Solidarity between European countries is there. \u201cI agree with Wolfgang\u201d, says George Osborne. Credibility in the markets comes from fiscal responsibility. The finances of several European countries are not on a strong enough footing, Osborne says. Britain\u2019s deficit has now been halved to 5% of GDP on his watch, but it\u2019s still too high. So it would be a mistake to risk financial credibility by raising spending, he argues. (Fact Check: in cash terms, Britain\u2019s deficit has only been cut by around a third, from \u00a3150bn to \u00a390bn) Schauble hits back at George Soros, saying that HE knows more about the German budgets than the billionaire philanthropist. Germany is committed to meeting European rules on budgets, he says, so it is running a budget surplus. Other countries aren\u2019t taking these rules seriously. Back to George Soros, who makes a plea to Europe to use its credit in the markets to fund a large infrastructure project. At current low borrowing costs, you could create employment, grow economies, and the value of the euro would appreciate. Germany would benefit too, he says, citing a new port which has potholes in the road leading up to it. Nice quote from Spanish finance minister, Luis de Guindos. Deflation is like cholesterol, he tells Davos. There\u2019s a good type and a bad type. We currently have the good sort in Spain, as falling prices are giving households more spending power. A quick show of hands shows a massive majority for Britain staying in the EU rather than leaving. George Osborne appeared to abstain, though -- repeating that he wants the UK to stay in Europe once its relationship with the EU is reformed. Osborne also welcomes the new eurozone quantitative easing programme, but adds that it\u2019s not enough - need structural reforms are needed too. Now George Osborne is speaking. He starts by joking that fellow panelist George Soros taught Britain at if you peg your currency against others then \u201cyou open up a heap of trouble.\u201d Europe must create jobs, and reform, the UK chancellor says. He pays credit to Spain. There are example of countries who have taken reforms and benefitted, and some who have not taken action and are being punished. So are you for being in Europe, or Out, Mr Osborne? The chancellor replies that he wants to be in a reformed Europe. Was it more important to preserve ECB independence than to listen to German concerns over QE? Wolfgang Schauble says he never comments on ECB policy.... but the German finance minister does flag up that there is a risk of moral hazard. He ducks a question on whether Germany will be covering the debts of other nations now. What about the negative reaction in the German papers? I have read it, yes, Schauble replies. But I will not play your game (by commenting on it). George Soros says his main concern is that the ECB\u2019s new quantitative easing programme will actually widen the divergence between rich and poor. He tells the panel on Europe\u2019s future that: It will benefit the owners of assets. Wages will remain under pressure, through competition and unemployment. This will reinforce a major concern between rich and poor. It will have political consequences. Soros predicts some \u201cfairly substantial moves coming\u201d in the market -- he won\u2019t be taking advantage though; the man who beat the Bank of England has retired from money making: We need a better balance between fiscal and monetary policy. Governor Visco is discussing the ECB\u2019s new QE programme. He says it was important to have a consensus decision. The size, composition, and timing are all crucial for QE. He also says he\u2019s confortable that 80% of the burden will fall on national central banks Heads-up: the Davos debate on Recharging Europe, including George Osborne, Wolfgang Schauble, Luis de Guindos -- three of Europe\u2019s most powerful finance ministers - is starting now. George Soros is also on the panel, along with Italian central bank governor Ignazio Visco. Live feed here: Ignazio Visco, the governor of Italy\u2019s central bank, has been discussing the European Central Bank\u2019s \u20ac1.1tn QE injection into the eurozone economy. Speaking in Davos, he suggested the \u20ac60bn a month bond-buying programme might continue beyond the provisional end date of the end of September 2016, should inflation fail to pick-up sufficiently. The eurozone slipped into deflation in December, when prices fell by 0.2%. The ECB\u2019s official target is for an inflation rate that is close to, but below, 2%. Speaking to Bloomberg Television earlier, Visco said: We are open-ended. That is, if we see that there are difficulties in achieving this target that we have, we have to continue. He added that the element of risk-sharing involved in the programme was something eurozone members could build on. We are a union, we have to trust each other and we have to build trust. But we are not a fiscal union. We have to build on this, it is a good starting point. AM The Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, is not worried that diverging paths taken by central banks in the US and Europe will hamper his efforts to fight deflation at home. In an interview with Bloomberg TV at Davos, Kuroda welcomed the ECB\u2019s decision on Thursday to launch a \u20ac1.1trn bond-buying programme. I don\u2019t think it makes our job more difficult. He said the euro had not fallen very much against the yen in the wake of the ECB move, and noted that the euro had already weakened previously. The US Federal Reserve is expected to lift interest rates this year after ending quantitative easing last October. Kuroda said this expected \u201cnormalisation\u201d of policy reflects strong US growth, which is good for the world economy. Back in Davos, economist Nouriel Roubini has been warning developing countries to press on with economic reforms before financial turbulence increases: Yesterday, Christine Lagarde predicted volatility and spillover effects once the US starts to raise interest rates. That would probably pull some money out of the emerging markets. On financial markets, the euro has fallen below 75p for the first time in seven years. It hit a low of 74.93p. The pound was boosted by the surprise rise in UK retail sales. The euro started sliding on Thursday after the ECB\u2019s decision to unleash quantitative easing. Shares are continuing their rally, after the ECB set out its bigger-than-expected bond buying programme. Germany\u2019s Dax is more than 150 points ahead, a 1.45% gain, while France\u2019s CAC is 75 points higher, or 1.65%. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares has hit a seven-year peak, trading 1.7% higher at 1478. In the UK, retail sales volumes grew by 0.4% last month from November, official figures showed. It was the weakest December performance for two years, but confounded fears of a 0.6% fall, with the Black Friday shopping bonanza bringing forward many pre-Christmas purchases into November. The data was skewed by the fact that the US-inspired discount day was included in November\u2019s figures for 2014, but within December\u2019s data the year before. Sales in the three months to December jumped 5% on a year earlier, the best performance in a decade. December was fuelled by supermarket sales and motorists taking advantage of cheaper petrol to fill up their tanks. The European Union will discuss increasing emergency funding for Ukraine next week according to Reuters. Aid could be increased to as much as \u20ac2.5bn, more than the \u20ac1.8bn already proposed by the European Commission, unnamed diplomats told Reuters. EU finance ministers will consider proposals at their meeting in Brussels on Tuesday. The loans would be for this year and next, in three or more tranches. The fall-out from the ECB\u2019s decision to launch quantitative easing in a bid to inject some life into the eurozone\u2019s ailing economy continues. The euro has been sliding since the announcement came on Thursday afternoon from the ECB\u2019s President Mario Draghi, and is now $1.263. It is the first time below $1.13 since September 2003. The single currency also fell to a 14-month low of 133.58 yen. AM The King of Jordan has cancelled his appearance at Davos today, following the death of Saudi King Abdullah. Other Arab delegates also left Davos prematurely, ahead of the funeral of the Saudi king. This means French president Francois Hollande will now speak at 2.15pm CET, not 11.30am as earlier planned. Oil prices have risen this morning following the news that Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Abdullah has died, aged 90. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of oil. Brent crude jumped $1.18 to $49.70 a barrel, a 2.4% gain, after the royal court announced the death. The US benchmark for March delivery rose $1.02, or 2.2%, to $47.33 a barrel. My colleague, Julia Kollewe, reports that the uncertainty over what his death means for Saudi\u2019s oil policy, is driving prices higher. The 90-year-old monarch, who was admitted to hospital in December with pneumonia, has been succeeded by his half-brother, Crown Prince Salman. He vowed to maintain the same approach as his predecessors in a speech on Friday. The key question is whether Salman, 79, keeps Ali al-Naimi as the country\u2019s oil minister, a position he has held since 1995. Many analysts do not expect Saudi oil policy to change. Oil prices have more than halved since the summer, when crude was more than $100 a barrel, amid an oil glut and weak global demand. A shale boom in the US has turned the US from the world\u2019s biggest oil importer into a major producer, pumping over 9m barrels a day. Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter, led a decision by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in November to keep the cartel\u2019s production unchanged at 30m barrels a day. Daniel Ang, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore, said: \u201cAs we are uncertain of how the new king would react to the current supply glut, we believe that the market is pricing in this uncertainty causing prices to spike. However, this premium would likely only persist temporarily. This premium should wear off once the market is clear of the new king\u2019s view on the oil situation.\u201d AM Technology firms are paying a very small rate of tax, Mark Carney has declared, at the end of the inequality debate. The governor explained: Some of the firms that take advantage of international tax system are tech firms.... a sense of responsibility is needed. European markets are up sharply this morning. Investors have a confident spring in their step this morning after Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, announced a \u20ac1.1tn programme of eurozone quantitative easing on Thursday afternoon. Fears over Sunday\u2019s Greek election - and the uncertainty the outcome will bring - have been shrugged off. FTSE 100: +0.5 % at 6,833.47 France\u2019s CAC 40: +1.3% at 4,610.16 Germany\u2019s DAX: +1.3% at 10,567.39 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1.3% at 10,645.3 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.5% at 20,575.2 AM US economist Bob Shiller, an expert on inequality, argues that the power of \u2018civil society\u2019 can keep the wealthiest in check, to a degree. Winnie Byanyima is right about unequal power, he says, but the rich can be shamed out of pursuing it too much. I think we should be happy that inequality is not worse, but Oxfam is going a good job in focusing attention on this problem. Evan Davies asks for a quick show of hands from the audience at the Davos debate on this question: Are the net 0.1% richest people net contributors to the world, the \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d type, or net extractors who create very clever financial products and take out money? And surprise, surprise.... there\u2019s a flurry of hands that the richest are net contributor, by about eight votes to one. Hardly a representative sample, of course..... Emma Watson, actress and campaigner for gender equality, has been speaking at a breakfast event in Davos. Appearing in her capacity as a goodwill ambassador for UN Women (a United Nations organisation), Watson joined an illustrious panel, including UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon. The purpose of Watson\u2019s Davos trip was to launch a new one year pilot scheme - IMPACT 10X10X10 - as part of the UN\u2019s HeForShe campaign. The aim is to engage governments, companies, and universities to be \u201cinstruments of change\u201d. Watson said she has been overwhelmed by the messages of support she has received since speaking at the launch of HeForShe in New York last September. She says the campaign is about asking each and every person, what are you doing to reduce gender equality. HeForShe wants to hear about people\u2019s experiences: Girls - who have been your mentors? Parents - did you make sure you treated your children equally? Husbands - have you supported your wives\u2019 aspirations? Young men - have you spoken up for women casually taunted? Media - have you thought about how women are portrayed publicly? Chief executives - what are you doing in your organisations? The \u201cwhat now\u201d is down to you. Decide your commitment, make it public, and please report back to us so we can support your story. Watson says she\u2019s had her \u201cbreath taken away\u201d since her speech last September. One girl told her that it enable to escape the cycle of her father\u2019s violence. The actress describes the drive for gender equality as \u201cfertile ground\u201d. Women share this planet 50/50 and they are under represented, they are astonishingly untapped. What is the impact you can have? What how when and with whom? AM Lagarde reiterates that excessive inequality is bad for growth, and also points out that the wealthy have benefitted from the rise in asset prices since the financial crisis. (that\u2019s because of the stimulus packages run by central banks since Lehman Brothers) Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, is making some important points about the causes of inequality. 1) Technological changes are driving down pay in some sectors 2) In a fully interconnected world, someone with very valuable skills can be very well rewarded. Steve Jobs brilliance is applied globally, not locally. Carney adds that the key challenge is to give equality of opportunity. Some instant reaction to this inequality debate: Sir Martin Sorrell defends wealth creators, such as himself. He tells Davos that he founded a company with 2 people, and now employs 179,000 people in 111 countries and invests $12bn in human capital each year. I make no apology for that whatsoever. Sorrell adds that the improvements in fighting extreme inequality and fatal diseases in recent decades doesn\u2019t get enough credit. And he reminds Lagarde that there isn\u2019t proof that equality drives growth. Byanyima hits back - a year ago, we found that 85 people own as much wealth as the bottom 50%. It\u2019s now down to 80 people. The situation is getting worse. That\u2019s not the best way to measure inequality, the BBC\u2019s Evan Davies suggests, given just how poor the poorest are. Oxfam International\u2019s Winnie Byanyima takes the floor, explaining how extreme wealth is distorting the way the world works. The financial lobbyists in the US spent $400m in 2013 influencing political debate, and $571m in campaigning contributions. They also spent $150m in the EU, lobbying governments. This is about shaping the rules of the market in their favour, Byanyima says: In an ideal situation we would have all people shaping the way the economy is governed and society is governed. Extreme wealth results in political capture, and from there on public decision making is conducted in the interest of the wealthy. The BBC then play two clips of wealthy men defending the rich, including British businessman Luke Johnson - who argues that our economy will suffer if we demonise wealth-creators as fat cats and plutocrats. Bank of England governor Mark Carney goes next, explaining how financial innovation - some good, some not so good - in the run-up to the crisis has allowed the system to lose its focus on social capital. He dubs it a \u201clet them eat credit\u201d approach - which allowed consumption to increase even as incomes didn\u2019t. The BBC\u2019s Evan Davies kicks off the inequality debate by reminding Christine Lagarde that the IMF pulled a screeching u-turn last year when she warned about the dangers of inequality. Yes, Lagarde replies. When I did that, some IMF economists warned that this wasn\u2019t a mainstream view. But now it is mainstream. She explains: If you increase the income share of the poorest, you get a multipling effect that you don\u2019t get when you increase the income share of the richest. Excessive inequality is bad for growth. Redistribution policies are not bad for growth, she adds - another thing economists had wrong before. Inequality is not good for growth. Inequality is not good for women, and that\u2019s an issue I\u2019m very concerned about, gender inequality. If you\u2019re on twitter, you can use the hashtag #bbcworlddebate to contribute to this inequality debate. It\u2019s starting now, with video clips of citizens around the world giving their views on inequality, unemployment, and social exclusion. The BBC debate on A Richer World, but for Whom? is starting any moment. Here\u2019s a webfeed: Irony alert. Some Davos attendees will be listening to the perils of inequality just hours after bobbing along at a terribly exclusive Google party (for the record, Team Guardian spent last diligently filing copy, tracking Prince Andrew\u2019s Davos reception, before discussing economic issues over a late supper #hardcore ) Hello from Davos, where the third day of the World Economic Forum is beginning. We\u2019ll be hearing a lot about inequality today, from some of the richest and most powerful people on the globe. The BBC is holding a big debate on this crucial subject, that aims to nail the issue, called \u201cA Richer World, but for Whom?\u201d On the panel, IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Bank of England governor Mark Carney, US economics professor Robert Shiller, advertising magnate Sir Martin Sorrell and - proving some much needed balance - Oxfam International director Winnie Byanyima. It\u2019s easy to mock the idea of inequality being discussed in this bubble of private jets, limos and huge wealth. So don\u2019t let us stop you. Readers might also note that inequality has been high on Davos\u2019s agenda for several years, and it\u2019s still a major problem. But some Davos attendees are genuinely determined to help. Take Bill and Melinda Gates, for example - they\u2019ll be talking about their vision for Sustainable Development this evening. The weak European economy is another issue in focus, a day after Mario Draghi (much missed at Davos) launched a long-awaited QE programme.

      "bodyText": "Greek shares led European stock markets higher ahead of Sunday\u2019s elections, while the euro slid to an 11-year low against the dollar, in the wake of the European Central Bank\u2019s decision to unleash a huge bond-buying programme. Stock and bond markets around the world were given a shot in the arm by the ECB\u2019s bigger than expected \u20ac1.1tn quantitative easing round to fight deflation and revive the ailing eurozone economy. European shares are heading for their best week in three years, as is the FTSE 100 index in London, while emerging markets are on course for their strongest performance in nearly 10 months. The Greek stock market staged a relief rally, jumping 6.6%, led by banks including Attica Bank, National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank. There was some optimism that the anti-bailout party Syriza, which is leading in the polls, could reach a compromise with Greece\u2019s lenders if they win the election. Daiwa economist Robert Kuenzel said: \u201cWith Greece having most to lose if it left the euro, we suspect Syriza\u2019s bark will be worse than its eventual bite.\u201d Greece will be eligible for the ECB bond-buying programme but subject to stricter conditions because of its bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The prospect of QE had already driven the euro lower in past months and the ECB\u2019s move on Thursday triggered fresh declines. The euro fell below 75p for the first time in seven years, dropping to 74.82p, down 1.2%. Against the dollar, it slid over 2% to go below $1.12 for the first time in more than 11 years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said: \u201cClearly there is a much greater chance that the euro hits parity with the US dollar once again, as it first did in 1999.\u201d He explained: \u201c2015 has opened with an astonishing number of event shocks and market volatility. These include further declines in oil prices, surprise rate cuts by various central banks, the lifting of the SNB\u2019s Swiss Franc cap against the euro and the unveiling of the ECB\u2019s substantial QE programme. One consequence has been the speed of the depreciation of the euro.\u201d Carmakers, which rely on exports and benefit from a weaker euro, were among the biggest gainers, with BMW shares up nearly 5% to hit a record high and France\u2019s Peugeot Citro\u00ebn rising 3.7%. European government bond prices rose, pushing Italian and Spanish 10-year yields to record lows. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares jumped more than 2% to 1483.91, a seven-year high, and is on track for its strongest week since December 2011. Shares also received a fillip from better than expected eurozone data. The composite Markit purchasing manager survey, which covers manufacturers and services firms, bounced to a five-month high of 52.2 from Cember\u2019s 51.4. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \u201cWe are moving away from the lows seen towards the end of last year but the actual rate of growth being signalled is still moderate.\u201d News of the death of Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Abdullah boosted oil prices amid uncertainty over whether this could mean a change to the kingdom\u2019s policy of allowing prices to fall. Brent crude gained more than a dollar to $49.70 a barrel. Oil prices pared gains when the new king, Abdullah\u2019s half brother Salman, vowed to stick to his predecessor\u2019s policies, and said Ali al-Naimi would remain the country\u2019s oil minister, a position he has held since 1995. Oil prices have more than halved since the summer, when crude was more than $100 a barrel, amid an oil glut and weak global demand.",

      "bodyText": "A rush to fill up cars with cheaper petrol and a jump in food shopping for Christmas helped UK retailers enjoy a surprise increase in sales last month. Official figures showed retail sales rose 0.4% from November, defying expectations for a fall among City economists. On the year, December sales were up 4.3%, again a much stronger performance than the 3% rise forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. The figures bolstered expectations that consumer spending will continue to drive the recovery as households begin to feel some relief from low inflation and a gradual pick-up in wages. \u201cSales look likely to continue to rise in coming months,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which publishes surveys on the UK and other economies. \u201cWage growth is picking up and inflation has slumped. Employment also continues to rise, meaning more people are earning. Lower oil prices will meanwhile cut motoring and utility bills further in coming months. The icing on the cake is the fact that interest rates look likely to stay at their current historic record lows for even longer than previously thought.\u201d The data from the Office for National Statistics showed fuel sales helped drive much of December\u2019s overall growth, suggesting motorists were trying to make the most of petrol and diesel at multiyear lows thanks to a sharp fall in oil prices. There was also help from supermarkets, which have been locked in a fierce price war. But the figures also echoed other reports of pressure on retailers\u2019 margins as growth in sales volumes continued to be accompanied by falling prices. Average store prices fell at the fastest annual rate for 12 years in December, down by 2.2%. After industry figures last week showed retail sales slowed in December, there had been fears that US-style Black Friday offers in November would have hit last month\u2019s performance on the official figures. But as it was, sales defied expectations. Paul Hollingsworth, of the thinktank Capital Economics, said the data painted a surprisingly upbeat picture of high street spending over Christmas. \u201cThis suggests that UK retailers\u2019 adoption of the US tradition of heavy discounting around \u201cBlack Friday\u201d did not merely cause consumers to bring forwards their Christmas purchases, but encouraged them to spend even more,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, sales volumes were a whopping 2.3% higher in the fourth quarter [of 2014] than in the third quarter, the strongest quarterly growth rate since April 2002.\u201d But not all stores escaped the Black Friday blow to December. Department stores bore the brunt of Christmas shopping being moved forward to November and their sales fell 4.5% on the month, the weakest performance since January 1996. While there was some annual growth in sales volumes, at 1.1% it was the weakest for more than a year.",

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, challenged the world\u2019s big technology companies to pay more tax as he stressed the perils of growing inequality at the World Economic Forum, in Davos. Carney said IT companies needed to show a greater sense of responsibility. \u201cSome of the firms that take advantage of international tax rules are the tech companies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe amount of tax they pay is small in relation to the system. A sense of responsibility is needed.\u201d Carney did not name any tech companies by name, but his remarks will add to the pressure on firms such as Google, which uses offshore arrangements to reduce its tax bill in the UK. Latest accounts for Google UK show sales of just \u00a3642m in 2013 and corporation tax of \u00a321.6m. The wider group, however, makes clear the scale of its business with UK customers was far larger \u2014 sales of \u00a33.6bn ($5.6bn) in fact \u2014 the lion\u2019s share of which was diverted through Ireland. This helped Google reach an effective tax rate of 15.7% for 2013 \u2014 well below the headline tax rate in the UK and all its major markets. Carney\u2019s comments fuel a controversy already raging in the UK, and last month George Osborne announced plans to impose a 25% levy on profits generated in Britain but shifted abroad. The governor said he was optimistic about the benefits of technological advances but added that there would be a period of adjustment while societies adjusted to the disruption caused. Technology\u2019s ability to displace white collar jobs was part of the reason for the squeeze on wages, he added. \u201cMany people are over-skilled for the jobs they are are doing, which keeps wages low.\u201d Carney said the importance of social capital had been underplayed during the period leading up to the financial crisis, when it was thought that markets provided the solution to every problem. Financial innovation, not all of it good, had allowed consumption to grow even while incomes were not rising. \u201cOne of my colleagues at the Bank dubs this the \u201clet them eat credit\u201d approach, Carney said. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said that over the past two years her organisation, once seen as a bastion of economic conservatism, had embraced the need to tackle inequality. She said: \u201cInequality is not conducive to sustainable growth. If you increase the income share of the poorest you get multiplier effect that you don\u2019t get if you increase the income share of the richest. Redistribution policies are not counter-productive for growth.\u201d In reply, Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive and founder of the advertising company WPP, said the world needed wealth creators. \u201cI founded a company with two people, which now employes 179,000 people in 111 countries and invests $12bn in human capital each year. I make no apology for that whatsoever.\u201d Hitting back at Lagarde, Sorrell \u2013 who has had run-ins with the City over his pay deals - said there was no evidence that equality led to faster growth.",
