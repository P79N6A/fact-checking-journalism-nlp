      "bodyText": "Parachuted into the Tesco hot seat a month early, on the day of a profit warning, he has already had to deal with a \u00a3264m accounting scandal, now on the desk of the Serious Fraud Office, and a rap on the knuckles from senior police over chaos in stores on Black Friday. But as Dave Lewis prepares to complete his eventful first 100 days at the helm of the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket, he still has a very large mountain to climb if he is to turn around the ailing chain. His first challenge will be Christmas. With only a few months\u2019 running in, Lewis could hardly deliver meaningful changes in the way Tesco trades through the biggest retail period of the year, plans for which will have been laid up to a year ago. But Lewis has sent head office staff into stores and raised the hours of shopfloor workers in an attempt to improve store standards and ensure goods are out on the shelves. He has also tried to raise morale by being more open and showing he is listening. \u201cWe sense management is carefully investing to stabilise the experience for existing customers,\u201d said Clive Black, retail analyst at City brokers Shore Capital. Prices have also been trimmed to keep in tune with rivals, but analysts doubt the tinkering will be enough to prevent a gloomy trading update on 8 January. Tesco continued to be the worst performer of the UK\u2019s major grocers in the last set of market share figures, revealed a few weeks ago. Sales had dropped by 3.7% in the 12 weeks to 9 November. Those expecting more action from Lewis may be disappointed, but most watchers believe the former Unilever executive, who has never run a retailer before, is right to put the UK business in a holding pattern while he works out his next steps. With a surge in the volume of goods moving through the business too much change could knock the whole system awry. \u201cLewis is quite right to take his time. It would be reckless to be too disruptive in the Christmas period,\u201d said Black. Tesco\u2019s boss is likely to have been dismayed by events on Black Friday when police were called to at least 16 stores as staff struggled to cope with crowds of bargain hunters taking advantage of the discount day. The company faced criticism from police chiefs for not having enough staff on hand to cope, while shoppers were angered as some found online orders placed on the day were delayed or sold out. One industry insider said the debacle may not have helped Tesco\u2019s image, but sales are thought to have gone \u201cspectacularly well\u201d. \u201cA bit of civil unrest and getting some sales in is better than quiet peaceful stores,\u201d the insider said. But is Lewis \u2013 known in the industry as \u201cDrastic Dave\u201d \u2013 ready to cause uproar in the wider market? Earlier this week he took direct control of the UK business and announced a number of posts on his executive team, potentially the first steps towards more dramatic action. Tesco has been losing shoppers as a dramatic shift gathers pace in the grocery industry, driven by the rise of discount chains including Aldi and Lidl, but also Poundland, B&amp;M and Home Bargains, which are undercutting the traditional supermarkets. As Morrisons, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco cut prices in the hope of winning over increasingly cost-conscious shoppers, the value of sales for the entire UK grocery market went into decline for the first time in at least 20 years last month. Despite being the UK\u2019s biggest retailer, Tesco has allowed itself to be undercut not only by the German incomers but also Asda and Morrisons. One leading industry executive said: \u201cTesco is the biggest boy in the playground. It\u2019s time it started throwing its muscle around.\u201d Another retail boss said Tesco needed to narrow the gap with the discounters. There have been no signs so far that Lewis is prepared to launch an all-out price war. Any plans are sure to have been hindered by the accounting scandal, in which \u00a3263m of profits have been mis-stated over at least two years. The scandal has led to the suspension of several key executives, many of whom have now left the business, including UK boss Chris Bush. But it will also have created nervousness among Tesco\u2019s product buyers and suppliers that is likely to have put a dampener on tough price negotiations. Most industry watchers are not expecting a sudden move on price in January. Lewis himself has said there is no point in cutting prices until Tesco\u2019s stores are running more smoothly. John Kershaw, an analyst at Exane, said that before Lewis becomes aggressive on price he must first stabilise the company\u2019s balance sheet with the sale of assets. He believes Lewis is likely to consider a sale of Tesco\u2019s central European operation as well as its Asian business and its stake in the Dunhumby data analysis firm. Others see the Blinkbox digital services business as a likely early disposal. If deals are on the cards, then Lewis is holding them close to his chest. A number of parties interested in one or more of Tesco\u2019s potentially saleable assets have been told they are not for sale. \u201cHe is keeping everybody guessing and quietly working behind the scenes,\u201d said the leading executive. \u201cIt\u2019s brave not to be tempted not to say more on strategy, but quite sensible. Why tell the competition and those looking to buy your assets what your plans are? That\u2019s not going to help the price.\u201d Black agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by the way he is going about things. The priority is the UK business and that\u2019s what we sense he is spending most of his time on.\u201d Dave Lewis timeline 1 September Dave Lewis joins Tesco a month ahead of schedule as the supermarket\u2019s problems grow and its chief executive, Phil Clarke, is fired. Lewis promises to review \u201call aspects\u201d of the group and shake up the management team. 22 September Shares in Tesco take a \u00a32bn dive as it admits to overstating its profits by around \u00a3250m in relation to supplier payments. Four senior executives including the UK supermarkets boss, Chris Bush, are suspended and the matter is referred to the Financial Conduct Authority. 23 September Alan Stewart, a former Marks &amp; Spencer director, is rushed in two months early as Tesco\u2019s new finance boss to help with the accounting investigation. Shares take another \u00a3700m dive, leaving the giant retailer worth just half its value of a year before. 24 September Tesco\u2019s second biggest shareholder, BlackRock, dumps its shares. Tesco confirms it has not had a finance director for five months as Laurie McIlwee stepped down in April. September 25 Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley takes a \u00a343m punt on Tesco\u2019s shares via a put option.2 October Famous investor Warren Buffett says buying shares in Tesco was \u201ca huge mistake\u201d. 3 October It emerges that Tesco has recently taken delivery of a $50m (\u00a332m) corporate jet bought by Phil Clarke in 2013. Lewis puts Tesco\u2019s entire fleet of jets, which includes at least three other aircraft, up for sale. 6 October Tesco recruits Mikael Ohlsson, the former boss of Ikea, and Compass\u2019s chief executive, Richard Cousins, as non-executive directors. 9 October Tesco admits it has ditched plans to build a huge superstore on Margate\u2019s seafront, just days after it emerged the group was mothballing two recently built stores. 23 October Interim results show not only that the black hole is bigger than expected, at \u00a3263m, but that the accounting errors stretch back at least two years. The chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, says he will quit. 24 October US investment group Harris Associates admits it has sold its final stake in Texo as ratings agency S&amp;P downgrades its view of Tesco. 26 October Lewis takes Tesco\u2019s top brass on a budget holiday to Norfolk so they can learn how customers shop and cook. 27 October Tesco reveals Lewis has been handed a \u00a34m golden hello. 29 October The Serious Fraud Office confirms it has begun a criminal investigation into Tesco\u2019s accounting practices. 2 November Tesco\u2019s former chief executive, Sir Terry Leahy, says the supermarket has lost contact with its customers. 2 December Lewis takes over day-to-day running of the UK supermarkets after a disastrous Black Friday sales event in which police were called to at least 16 stores.",

      "bodyText": "TalkTalk is investigating whether its customer database has been leaked after more than 100 customers said they had received calls from Indian-based scammers quoting their names, addresses and account number details. Suspicions have been raised that a data leak could have come from a call centre used by TalkTalk in India, although the UK internet service provider, which has more than 4 million customers, said it had \u201cno concrete evidence of a data breach\u201d from any of its systems. A number of customers in TalkTalk forums said they had been contacted in the past fortnight, apparently from India, by callers who quoted their TalkTalk account details to try to assuage doubts about whether the call was legitimate. A similar scam earlier this year targeted BT Broadband customers, with scammers also quoting account numbers. One person said on TalkTalk\u2019s forums they were nearly caught out because of the data that was supplied: \u201c[The] caller was obviously from India and his English was poor. [He] claimed he was from TalkTalk and when I queried this he reeled off my account number plus name and address.\u201d Others on the forum confirmed their account details had been provided in the call. The account number is not publicly available information \u2013 though it is held on TalkTalk\u2019s systems and is used in customer support. A spokeswoman for TalkTalk said there were other ways the scammers might have acquired the account numbers, such as through phishing emails, but she could not say whether TalkTalk had seen any phishing emails recently that would explain the abrupt surge in calls accurately quoting data. If TalkTalk\u2019s customer data has leaked, it could potentially be liable to a fine under the Data Protection Act for failing to secure personal information \u2013 a requirement for British companies even if they store or process data overseas. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said it had been informed TalkTalk was investigating the source of the account details. TalkTalk is asking customers who have received calls to contact its online scam report page at www.talktalk.co.uk/help/report-scam. The use of call centres in India for both remote telephone support of legitimate businesses, and for making scam calls of this sort, has long led to suspicions that customer details are leaked by unscrupulous workers or managers to the gangs who run the scams.

      "bodyText": "PS: our latest news story is here: US jobs report beats forecasts as 321,000 positions added in November OK, time to wrap up. A brief recap of the impressive US jobs data: America\u2019s recovery continues, economists say, after it created more jobs than in any month since January 2012. Highlights start here. The US non-farm payroll expanded by 321,000 in November, smashing forecasts. Average hourly earnings rose by more than expected too, by 0.4%, although wages were only 2.1% higher annually. The unemployment rate stayed at a six-year low of 5.8%. The dollar has surged on the back of the data, amid speculation that the Federal Reserve will begin to tighten monetary policy in the first half of 2015. Andrew Glen, currency analyst for Caxton FX, suggests the dollar will continue to rally, while the pound will suffer from jitters as next May\u2019s election approaches (here\u2019s his take). Anthony Valeri, fixed-income strategist at LPL Financial in San Diego, says: \u201cIt is unequivocally bullish on the U.S. economy.\u201d And Goldman Sachs reckons the Fed could react at this month\u2019s meeting. The Dow Jones industrial average hit a record high, with traders cheered by the US economic picture. European markets rallied too. The job creation was broad-based, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said, led by professional and business services, retail trade, health care, and manufacturing. A better picture than in Europe, where the Bundesbank halved its growth forecast for 2015 and the European Central Bank remains riven by dissent over a new stimulus package. This summary has the details: Lunchtime summary: Weidmann blasts QE, as Bundesbank slashes forecasts That\u2019s all for the week. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Some breaking news back in Europe -- Ireland\u2019s credit rating has been upgraded by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s from A- to A. That\u2019s the sixth-highest credit rating. European stock markets have also surged tonight, with Germany\u2019s DAX hitting a record closing high. Shares rose on the back of the US jobs report, and on speculation that - despite the divisions at its heart - the ECB will launch a QE programme early next year. The news that 321,000 new jobs were created last month is no reason to celebrate, argues the Republican party. Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, argues that a 300,000-plus jobs report should be a regular event, not the best in almost three years. And optimism over the US economic situation has driven shares on Wall Street to a new alltime high. The Dow Jones industrial average moved closer to the 18,000 mark, jumping 63 points or 0.4% to 17,953. Financial stocks are leading the rally; JP Morgan are up 2.2%, helped by the news that CEO Jamie Dimon has said there is no evidence of cancer in his body, following treatment for throat cancer. The pound has hit its lowest level against the US dollar in 15 months, hitting $1.5572 after the jobs report. The US Federal Reserve could start to raise borrowing costs next spring, given the strength of today\u2019s jobs report, suggests Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics: The massive 321,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in November, together with the 44,000 upward revision to the two preceding months, bolsters our view that the Fed will begin to hike interest rates as soon as March next year. As Fed officials keep stressing, the decision is data dependent and these data are pretty conclusive: Labour market conditions are improving at breakneck speed. And the bond market agrees. The yields, or interest rates, on US Treasuries have risen, showing that prices have dropped. That suggests traders anticipate an interest rate rise sooner than they did before. Almost two-thirds of the US jobs created in the last year are in sectors that pay below the average rate, flags up Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s top currency strategist Kit Juckes: The US dollar will keep climbing if the next few Non-Farm Payroll reports are as strong as today\u2019s \u201cwhopper\u201d, says Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe: \u201cIf results like this become the norm, the dollar\u2019s meteoric appreciation will be difficult to stop and tighter monetary policy will become a foregone conclusion. However there is still cause for caution in the US and, with winter looming, if the economy cools with the weather the dollar is at lofty heights to fall from.\u201d I missed this detail earlier.... factory workers\u2019 pay rises lagged behind the average last month; a sign that the recovery isn\u2019t being shared widely enough. The US economy isn\u2019t a complete bed of roses, though. The latest factory orders data just hit the wires, and it\u2019s worse than expected. Orders fell by 0.7% month-on month in October; economists expected a flat reading. And if you strip out transportation, orders were down by 1.4%. Mads Koefoed, head of macro strategy at Saxo Bank, agrees that today\u2019s report brings the first US rate rise closer (and \u2018fesses up that his guesstimate was too pessimistic) What a report! The November US employment report blew all expectations out of the water with a gain of 321,000 in nonfarm payrolls. Nearly 100,000 more than the 230,000 expected by consensus and even further from my 207,000 estimate based on other labour market indicators..... Overall, this was a very good employment report. Go ahead FOMC, raise that rate! Wall Street has taken the jobs report in its stride; the Dow Jones industrial average is up just 0.15% in early trading at 17926. The US dollar just hit its highest level against a basket of currencies since March 2009. Thomas Perez, the US secretary of labor, has told Bloomberg TV that the improvements in the economy this year will lift wages higher in 2015. Dr Tara Sinclair, chief economist at Indeed.com and Professor at George Washington University, is upbeat about the forecast-smashing jobs report: \u201c2014 is on track to be the best year for US job gains since 1999. This report means a very Merry Christmas for the U.S. The big question today is why the labor participation rate remains unchanged with so many jobs being created? Workers will now have greater choice than they have had in years. If you\u2019re not happy in your job, start looking for a new one! If you left the workforce during tighter times, now is the time to get back into the market. With job creation on this scale, 2015 should be the year people make those career changing resolutions! Despite November\u2019s strong jobs report, there are still over nine million Americans out of work. Our US economics editor, Heidi Moore, reports: The unemployment rate for white men rose to 5.4% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which measures employment in the US. The BLS added that the rates remained unchanged for other groups, including adult women at 5.3%, teenagers at 17.7%, blacks at 11.1% and Hispanics at 6.6% The Economic Policy Institute said the jobs additions were \u201csurprising and encouraging\u201d but added: \u201cit\u2019s important to put these numbers in context. At this rate, we won\u2019t return to pre-recession labor market health until October 2016\u2014nearly nine years since the recession began.\u201d Here\u2019s her news story: US jobs report beats forecasts as 321,000 positions added in November The US dollar is strengthening as traders anticipate the Federal Reserve raising interest rates next year, perhaps in the summer? Andrew Glen, currency analyst for Caxton FX, explains: The Non-Farms upside surprise has boosted US dollar across the board. With US Non-Farm Payrolls coming in at 321k against a forecast 231k the expectation of rate rises next year in the US has increased. The pound and the euro fell 0.35% and 0.5% respectively against US dollar on the news. As we look towards the New Year investors may continue the trend of USD strength especially with the uncertainty around other haven currencies. In the UK, next May\u2019s general election could weigh on the pound. The Japanese yen is weaker since its central bank boosted its quantitative easing programme. And in Europe, the euro will slide if the ECB launches its own QE. Three good reasons to be holding the US dollar instead. Peter Elston, global investment strategist at Seneca Investment Manager, reckons the recent slump in the oil price should give the US employment market another boost: \u201cIn light of the recent fall in the oil price, which will have a positive impact on aggregate demand, the chances of further improvement are higher than they were back in June. \u201cThat said, we are now in the sixth year of the recovery and it\u2019s surprising, given all the monetary stimulus, that employment growth has not been stronger. We have yet to see whether the US economy can absorb the impact of the end of the Fed\u2019s bond buying program in October, he adds. Rob Carnell of Dutch bank ING says the hawkish members of the Federal Reserve may be heartened by the 321,000 surge in US employment last month: There is no doubt that this is an impressive figure, and will give the hawks at the Fed a bit more fire in their bellies at the next FOMC meeting. But the detail of the release is a bit less impressive on further inspection. The household survey rose only 4,000. And as a result, the unemployment rate went nowhere, staying at 5.8%. Economics professor Justin Wolfers says we shouldn\u2019t get excited about wages, just because average hourly earnings grew by 0.4% in the month. But he agrees that it\u2019s a strong non-farm payroll report: The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that job gains were \u201cwidespread\u201d last month. They were led by growth in professional and business services, retail trade, health care, and manufacturing. Professional and business services: +86,000 in November Retail trade: +50,000 Health care: + 29,000 Manufacturing: +28,000 jobs Financial activities: +20,000 Transportation and warehousing: +17,000 Food services and drinking places: +27,000 Construction: +20,000 Full release is here The US dollar has surged on the back of the jobs report. This drove the Japanese yen to new seven year lows, at \u00a5121.3 to the $1. My immediate reaction to this report is \u201cWow\u201d, says Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, on Bloomberg TV. He adds that such a strong increase in employment highlights how America is outperforming Europe. Something for the opponents of looser eurozone monetary policy to ponder... Some more detail... the labor force participation rate was unchanged, at 62.8%. The under-employment rate dipped, to 11.4% from 11.5%. On an annual basis, US wages rose by 2.1% in November. That\u2019s an increase on the 2.0% recorded in October. That\u2019s good, but still below the trend before the financial crisis, and only slightly above the US inflation rate of 1.7%. This is the 10th month running that America has now created at least 200,00 new jobs, according to the non-farm payroll. That\u2019s the best stretch since 1994, when Bill Clinton was in situ in the Oval Office. Important point -- average hourly earnings rose by 0.4% last month. That\u2019s stronger than expected, and suggests that the US recovery is feeding through to consumers. This is a strong jobs report, no doubt about it. More good news -- September and October\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll reports have been revised higher, to show an extra 44,000 new jobs created over those two months. The US unemployment rate remains at 5.8%, a six-year low. Breaking: A total of 321,000 new jobs were created across the US economy last month, much stronger than expected. That\u2019s the biggest monthly total since January 2012. President Obama will be looking for signs of wage growth in today\u2019s non-farm payroll report. Earlier this week, he said that he has deep concern that wages and incomes have not risen significantly, despite corporate profits hitting their highest levels in 60 years. London-based economist Marc Ostwald predicts we\u2019ll see a \u201csolid, if unspectacular gain\u201d on non-farm payroll. The key, he adds, is the \u201cbreadth\u201d of job creation -- ie, which firms took on more staff. How well did America\u2019s labor market perform in November? We\u2019re about to find out. The Non-Farm Payroll, due out at 8.30am Washington time or 1.30pm in the UK, will show how many new jobs were created last month Economists predict that around the NFP will rise by 230,000, a faster pace of job-creation than October\u2019s 213,000. But there\u2019s a wide range of wild guesses sober predictions from the finest minds on Wall Street and Twitter, as this chart shows: NFP is notoriously hard to predict, and regularly revised, so the top-line number should be treated with caution. We\u2019ll also be looking to see whether wage growth picked up last month, and whether the average hours worked rose. That will show whether the remaining slack in the labor market is being mopped up, bringing closer the day when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Other factors to watch include: the labor force participation rate, showing whether more adults dropped out altogether, The breakdown of where new jobs were created And the ratio of part time workers to full-time ones Time for a brief recap before the last major economic news of the week - the US Non-Farm Payroll for November. Germany\u2019s top central banker has raised the stakes in the battle over eurozone QE, declaring that a new bond-buying programme would not solve the region\u2019s economic problems. Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann said a QE programme could violate EU laws, and might not improve the situation: \u201cYou cannot simply apply the same formula in Europe that has enjoyed success in the U.S. or in Japan...In the USA, there is a central state that issues bonds that are very safe and secure. We don\u2019t have that central state here. It highlights the split at the heart of the ECB over QE -- reports claim that three members of its six-strong executive board opposed the hardened-up language in president Mario Draghi\u2019s statement yesterday. Economist Stephen Lewis says Draghi will struggle to launch QE without the support of Weidmann et al: For the ECB to decide on action that leading German policymakers see not only as being against their national interests but as undermining constitutional safeguards of Germany\u2019s position would be a course fraught with danger. It would take the debate over euro zone monetary policy to a different level, bringing into question Germany\u2019s relations with other EU member-states. Weidmann\u2019s comments came as the Bundesbank highlighted the weak state of the eurozone economy, by halving its growth forecast for 2015 to just 1%. But the latest German factory orders are more encouraging, smashing forecasts by rising 2.5% month-on-month. Economists say it suggests the economy is recovering. Eurostat has confirmed that the eurozone grew by just 0.2% in the third quarter of the year; its new data also showed that business investment continued to fall. The oil price is down again today, near a five-year low. That will push down inflation in the euro area, and beyond. And Ukraine\u2019s finances look shakier, after its FX reserves dwindled below $10bn for the first time in almost a decade. Britain\u2019s food industry is in the dock again, after one of Britain\u2019s biggest manufacturers asked suppliers for cash in return for, possibly, giving them business in future. There is widespread anger after BBC Newsnight reported last night that Premier Foods (the firm behind Oxo cubes and Mr Kipling) had been making some exceedingly excessive demands. One small business in the south west had been asked to pay \u00a31,700 to stay on its list of suppliers. Industry bodies say it\u2019s proof that big business is grinding smaller firms relentlessly into the ground. And now the Institute of Directors has weighted in too; director general Simon Walker, said the news was \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d. Such hostile business practices will, rightly, not be tolerated by the public, he says: \u201cIf companies continue to give politicians good cause to intervene, they cannot be surprised when regulations begin to rain down. Holding small businesses and suppliers at gun-point is a sure way to catch the attention of policymakers and regulators. Premier need to consider their arrangements closely. We encourage them to think of the long-term damage they could be doing to their suppliers, their brands, and business in general.\u201d More here: Fury over Premier Foods \u2018pay to stay\u2019 scheme The oil price is dipping back towards five-year lows today. Brent crude is now down at $69.11 per barrel, down from $69.64 last night. US crude is changing hands for $66.35, down from $66.83. This chart, via fastFT\u2019s Robin Wigglesworth, shows the likely impact on inflation if oil keeps falling: Worrying news from Ukraine, its foreign exchange and gold reserves have fallen to their lowest level in almost a decade. Ukraine held less than $10bn of FX reserves in November, after paying off $1.45bn of energy bills to Russia. The WSJ has more details (\u00a3). More quotes from Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann have arrived. He warned that quantitative easing might not work in the eurozone, even though it did help the American economy to recover: \u201cYou cannot simply apply the same formula in Europe that has enjoyed success in the U.S. or in Japan\u201d \u201cIn the USA, there is a central state that issues bonds that are very safe and secure. We don\u2019t have that central state here,\u201d And he rejected the idea that economic weakness required an expansive monetary and fiscal policy (as Keynesians believe). \u201cI am not convinced of this. Rather, I am of the view that this approach is not the solution, rather the cause (of economic woes).\u201d Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, one of the main hawks at the ECB, has just been attacking the idea of a QE programme. Brushing over the fact that the Bundesbank just halved its 2015 growth forecast, Weidmann declared that current expansive ECB policy was too loose for Germany. He told an event hosted by German newspaper Die Zeit in Frankfurt that: \u201cWe have a monetary policy that is too expansive for Germany,\u201d Buying up sovereign bonds with newly minted money is not the answer, Weidmann insisted, adding that it might breach EU treaties (something ECB chief Mario Draghi rejected yesterday). Here\u2019s the newswire snaps: BUNDESBANK\u2019S WEIDMANN SAYS IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION AS A CENTRAL BANK BUNDESBANK\u2019S WEIDMANN SAYS CANNOT USE SAME FORMULAS THAT WERE USED IN JAPAN AND ELSEWHERE IN EURO ZONE BUNDESBANK\u2019S WEIDMANN SAYS EUROPEAN TREATIES RULE OUT A MUTUALISATION OF RISKS BUNDESBANK\u2019S WEIDMANN SAYS WE HAVE A MONETARY POLICY WHICH IS TOO EXPANSIVE FOR GERMANY BUNDESBANK\u2019S WEIDMANN SAYS MONETARY POLICY IS EXPANSIVE AND RIGHTLY SO BUNDESBANK\u2019S WEIDMANN SAYS LOW INTEREST RATES CAN RESULT IN LOWER WILLINGNESS TO MAKE STRUCTURAL REFORMS The eurozone grew by just 0.2% in the third quarter of this year, Eurostat had confirmed. Germany grew by a meagre 0.1%, avoiding recession, while France expanded by 0.3%. That\u2019s all in line with the first estimate, last month. The data also show that household spending rose during the quarter, while investment across the eurozone fell again. Eurostat reports: During the third quarter of 2014, household final consumption expenditure rose by 0.5% in the euro area and by 0.6% in the EU28 (after +0.3% and +0.4% respectively in the previous quarter). Gross fixed capital formation decreased by 0.3% in the euro area and increased by 0.5% in the EU28 (after -1.2% and -0.6%). Exports rose by 0.8% in the euro area and by 0.6% in the EU28 (after +1.4% and +1.0%). Imports increased by 1.2% in the euro area and by 1.1% in the EU28 (after +1.3% and +1.0%). Three former ICAP brokers have pleaded not guilty in London this morning to criminal charges they had sought to manipulate benchmark interest rates, Reuters reports. That brings to six the number of not guilty pleas since regulators worldwide began investigating allegations that traders had conspired to rig foreign exchange rates. Colin Goodman, Darrell Read and Danny Wilkinson entered their pleas at London\u2019s Southwark Crown Court, Reuters adds. Britons have dialled down their expectations of a UK interest rate rise. A poll just published by the Bank of England show that just 37% of people expect rates to rise in the next 12 months, down from 49% in August. The public also expect weaker inflation over the coming year, reacting to recent slowdown in rising prices. They expect inflation to average 2.5%, down from 2.8% in August. That\u2019s the lowest expectation since February 2010. The consumer prices index, the headline measure of inflation, was just 1.3% in October. However, the retail prices index was 2.3%. Mixed news for UK rail passengers today. Fares will increase by 2.2% in 2015, the slowest rate since 2010, but more commuters will be pushed into the \u00a35,000-a-year price bracket for a season ticket. More here: Lowest rail fare increase for five years Mark Ostwald, economist at ADM Investor Services, says the 2.5% jump in German factory orders confirms that Germany\u2019s economy is recovering. However, they also \u201cdo not imply a marked pick-up in growth\u201d, a point hammered home by the Bundesbank\u2019s new forecasts. The Mayor of London\u2019s special economic advisor, Gerald Lyons, has tweeted about the Bundesbank\u2019s new, more pessimistic forecasts: Another encouraging signal \u2013 Spain\u2019s industrial production grew at a faster pace in October. It was up 1.2% year-on-year, a rise on 1.0% in September. More here. The battle to control Canary Wharf took another twist; its owner, Songbird, has rejected the \u00a32.6bn final cash bid launched by Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and a North American property firm yesterday. The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), which already owns nearly 29% of Songbird, and Brookfield offered to pay 350p a share, after their initial 295p offer was rejected last month. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Songbird\u2019s shareholders now have 60 days to decide whether to accept the pair\u2019s \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d bid, raised from \u00a32.2bn. It came 90 minutes before a regulatory deadline on Thursday and cannot be raised again. But the board of Songbird said it was still too low, pointing to a recent independent valuation that estimated its net asset value at 381p a share, up 19% since June. ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski suggests Germany\u2019s economy is recovering now that the summer hols are over: Coming up soon...the second estimate of eurozone GDP for the third quarter, at 10am GMT. That\u2019s likely to confirm that the euro area grew by just 0.2%. Finland\u2019s statistics board has already released its updated figures - confirming that the Finnish economy grew by 0.2% in the third quarter. It also hiked its Q2 growth to 0.4%, which means Finland\u2019s economy is now slightly larger than a year ago (it went into recession last winter). The forecast-beating 2.5% surge in German factory orders in October suggests Europe\u2019s economy is in better shape than feared. So reckon Nick Kounis, economist at ABN Amro. Stefan Kipar, an economist at BayernLB, reckons Germany\u2019s economy is back on track after a ropey summer: \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that negative GDP growth rates can be avoided in winter too,\u201d European stock markets have opened higher, after sliding yesterday after the ECB dashed hopes of QE this year. The French CAC and German DAX are both up around 1%. Back to yesterday\u2019s ding-dong battle at the European Central Bank over whether to unleash QE to fight off deflation.... Analysts at Japanese bank Nomura reckon the ECB is almost certain to launch a big quantitative easing programme soon, having agreed to reassess the situation in the new year. UBS, though, is concerned that the governing council, and the smaller executive board, are split over Draghi\u2019s intention to expand the ECB\u2019s balance sheet by up to \u20ac1trn: Jens Weidmann also suggests that the slide in the oil price could boost Germany\u2019s economy next year. He says: \u201cIf crude oil prices remain at this subdued level for an extended period of time, economic growth in 2015 and 2016 could turn out to be between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage point higher in each case.\u201d There\u2019s a subtext here; yesterday, Mario Draghi said the deflationary impact of the oil price could trigger a QE programme early next year. Weidmann, who opposes QE, is clearly in the \u2018cheap oil is good\u2019 camp. More news from Germany \u2013 its central bank has just taken a knife to its growth forecasts. Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann (fresh from battling Mario Draghi at yesterday\u2019s ECB meeting) said Germany was going through a \u2018sluggish\u2019 phase. The Bundesbank now expects growth of 1.4% this year, down from 1.9% predicted six months ago. And next year it only expects GDP to increase by 1.0%, compared to the 2.0% it forecast in June before the eurozone economy began to weaken. For 2016, it has cut its forecast from 1.8% to 1.6%. Weidmann hopes Germany will pick up soon, as the global economy recovers: \u201cThere is reason to hope that the current sluggish phase will prove to be short-lived.\u201d This morning\u2019s upbeat factory orders do suggest things are improving, but it\u2019s a reminder of the weak state of the eurozone.... Germany\u2019s industrial sector has posted a big jump in orders, data released this morning shows. It suggests that Europe\u2019s largest economy may be recovering from its mid-year blight. Factory orders surged by 2.5% month-on-month in October, beating forecasts of a 0.5% jump. And September\u2019s figure has been revised up to, from +0.8% rise in growth to +1.1%. The data, from the German economy ministry, shows that domestic orders surged by 5.3% while foreign orders gained 0.6%. That suggests the German economy is picking up, having avoided recession in the third quarter of the year. The ministry declared that the fourth quarter of this year has started very positively. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The charge towards Christmas is on. Today we get the final US jobs report of this year, and it could be a blowout number. November\u2019s non-farm payroll, released at 1.30pm this afternoon, is expected to show that 230,000 new jobs were created during the month, up from 214,000 in October. But some experts are predicting a bigger increase in employment, as America\u2019s economy continues to grow faster than most major rivals. There\u2019s chatter of a NFP increase of close to 300,000; which might spark speculation of a US interest rate hike in early 2015. Economists also expect America\u2019s unemployment rate to remain at a six-year low of just 5.8% . Wages may also continue to rise, according to these forecasts (via Business Insider) Average hourly earnings, month-on-month: +0.2% Average hourly earnings, year-on-year: +2.1% Average weekly hours worked: 34.6 Also coming up today: Economists are digesting yesterday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting and press conference, which exposed divisions at the top of the ECB over a possible QE programme. And the tussle between Greece and its lenders continues. The latest news is that eurozone ministers continuing a six-month extension to its loans programme. The Greek government, though, wants the bailout over in a few weeks.... Eurozone mulls extending Greek bailout by six months, Athens refuses I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

Punjabi music, it seems, had a downmarket reputation. \u201cBecause within the community,\u201d explains DJ Rekha, \u201cit\u2019s too rough, it\u2019s too cab driver.\u201d In India and its diaspora, Punjabis suffer a stereotype that portrays them as loud and flashy. </p> <p>The promoters\u2019 requests struck a deep nerve within DJ Rekha, and instead of acquiescing to their desires to shove the Punjabi music aside, she pushed back. </p> <p>\u201cLuckily, I had the freedom to do what I wanted and really go in hard on the Bhangra in a way that hadn\u2019t been done,\u201d she says. It served her well; her career skyrocketed. She says the success of a DJ relies on building a regular audience, which is a different skill than just being an excellent DJ. </p> <p>The Basement Bhangra crowd has thinned over the years, which she attributes to changing music tastes, attention spans and entertainment options. She\u2019s also found Manhattan to be \u201cdouchier\u201d; for some partygoers it\u2019s about getting expensive bottle service and showing off status rather than dancing. One of these specimens wondered into Basement Bhangra the other night, quickly sized up the crowd, which he found to be \u201cunrefined\u201d, said the bhangra scene in London was better, and made a quick exit to Lavo, a glitzy midtown club with bottle service.</p> <p>DJ Rekha says she doesn\u2019t serve the snobs. \u201cI\u2019ve always made the party cheap and accessible,\u201d she says. The $15 entrance fee is waved for early birds, which might keep some partygoers returning, but DJ Rekha attributes her longevity and success to her DJ sets\u2019 accessibility. She rarely meets people who don\u2019t like Bhangra. \u201cIt\u2019s good music,\u201d says DJ Rekha. \u201cI\u2019ll stand by that.\u201d</p>",

When she started DJing at Basement Bhangra in 1997, she and her new partner DJ Joy had been instructed by Indian-American promoters to \u201ckeep it safe\u201d and not to play too much Punjabi music. Punjabi music, it seems, had a downmarket reputation. \u201cBecause within the community,\u201d explains DJ Rekha, \u201cit\u2019s too rough, it\u2019s too cab driver.\u201d In India and its diaspora, Punjabis suffer a stereotype that portrays them as loud and flashy. The promoters\u2019 requests struck a deep nerve within DJ Rekha, and instead of acquiescing to their desires to shove the Punjabi music aside, she pushed back. \u201cLuckily, I had the freedom to do what I wanted and really go in hard on the Bhangra in a way that hadn\u2019t been done,\u201d she says. It served her well; her career skyrocketed. She says the success of a DJ relies on building a regular audience, which is a different skill than just being an excellent DJ. The Basement Bhangra crowd has thinned over the years, which she attributes to changing music tastes, attention spans and entertainment options. She\u2019s also found Manhattan to be \u201cdouchier\u201d; for some partygoers it\u2019s about getting expensive bottle service and showing off status rather than dancing. One of these specimens wondered into Basement Bhangra the other night, quickly sized up the crowd, which he found to be \u201cunrefined\u201d, said the bhangra scene in London was better, and made a quick exit to Lavo, a glitzy midtown club with bottle service. DJ Rekha says she doesn\u2019t serve the snobs. \u201cI\u2019ve always made the party cheap and accessible,\u201d she says. The $15 entrance fee is waved for early birds, which might keep some partygoers returning, but DJ Rekha attributes her longevity and success to her DJ sets\u2019 accessibility. She rarely meets people who don\u2019t like Bhangra. \u201cIt\u2019s good music,\u201d says DJ Rekha. \u201cI\u2019ll stand by that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The US added 321,000 jobs in November, keeping the unemployment rate at 5.8% and 9 million Americans out of work. The unemployment rate for white men rose to 5.4% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which measures employment in the US. The BLS added that the rates remained unchanged for other groups, including adult women at 5.3%, teenagers at 17.7%, blacks at 11.1% and Hispanics at 6.6% The Economic Policy Institute said the jobs additions were \u201csurprising and encouraging\u201d but added: \u201cit\u2019s important to put these numbers in context. At this rate, we won\u2019t return to pre-recession labor market health until October 2016\u2014nearly nine years since the recession began.\u201d Economists had worried that November jobs numbers would disappoint after unpredictable storms swept the country Thanksgiving week. \u201cThe November report today is a real wild card,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cSeasonals, weather effects and a tendency to be under-reported initially all threaten the number.\u201d Job creation has been growing all year \u2013 but, much to the consternation of many economists, the jobs being created are heavily part-time and low-paid. These low-quality jobs and low pay ensure many Americans are not working. In November, for instance, 73,000 of the newly created jobs were clustered in low-wage categories. That has created a near-record low number of Americans participating in the workforce, at 62.8% \u2013 levels last seen during the 1970s. That number has not budged since April, showing a stubborn stagnation. The highest rate of Americans participating in the labor force was in 2000, at the height of the tech boom, when 67.3% of Americans were working. The rise of low-wage jobs has become a matter of activism. Minimum-wage protests have swept the nation, including rallies in 150 cities on Thursday against fast-food wages. The Economic Policy Institute also plans to highlight the problem of low pay by introducing a new wage-tracking tool based on the employment numbers, \u201cto track the cumulative effect of the ongoing failure of wages to hit target levels, and how this relates to labor\u2019s share of corporate income\u201d. One of the leading predictors of the employment report is jobless claims, a statistic which measures how many people apply for unemployment benefits. This week, 297,000 people filed for jobless claims, down slightly from a relatively high 314,000 in the last week of November. Over the past four weeks, more people have filed for jobless claims, adding up to an average of 299,000 over the past four weeks. That\u2019s up from 294,000 on average over the previous four weeks. The jump was due to \u201charsher-than-usual weather,\u201d according to Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist at High-Frequency Economics. Still, many economists see reasons for optimism. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at McGladrey, said the employment report was a \u201cgood strong number across the board. This is the point in the US economy where we\u2019re going to generate escape velocity and generate wage gains over the next six months.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of easyJet, Carolyn McCall, was paid \u00a37.7m last year, with more than \u00a37m coming in bonuses. She was paid a salary of \u00a3665,000 and an annual bonus of \u00a31.15m for 2013-2014, with a share award worth \u00a35.9m. The budget airline\u2019s chief financial officer, Chris Kennedy, was paid just over \u00a34m. EasyJet\u2019s biggest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who voted last year against the company\u2019s remuneration report, has yet to comment. Although the airline\u2019s founder has frequently railed against the board, his anger has been dampened by two years of dividend payouts totalling more than \u00a3200m. EasyJet flew 64.8 million passengers in the year to 30 September 2014 and recorded profits before tax of \u00a3581m. It paid \u00a3131m in tax, including \u00a399m corporation tax. An easyJet spokesman said: \u201cEasyJet\u2019s remuneration for directors is heavily weighted towards variable pay, dependent on performance. This ensures that there is a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the amount paid to directors. \u201cPassengers have also benefited with reduced average fares year on year and on-time performance of 85% for arrivals within 15 minutes. \u201cCarolyn McCall\u2019s remuneration reflects easyJet\u2019s record profits, returns and share price rise. EasyJet\u2019s remuneration policy is constantly reviewed to ensure it is aligned with easyJet\u2019s principles and with institutional investors\u2019 best practice expectations and is in line with companies of similar size and turnover in the FTSE 100.\u201d The report revealed that McCall\u2019s reported pay package of \u00a36.4m for 2013 ended up being \u00a37.8m when her share award vested. EasyJet\u2019s accounts base the value of McCall\u2019s share award for 2014 on an average share price, which is 30% lower than the current price. The company\u2019s current value could push her overall rewards over \u00a39.5m in January when the shares pay out. According to the annual report, Kennedy\u2019s future potential bonuses are to be bolstered because his \u201cremuneration is falling well below comparable market benchmarks in total pay and follows extensive dialogue with the company\u2019s major shareholders and the leading shareholder advisory bodies on this issue\u201d. His potential annual bonus is increasing from 150% of his \u00a3430,800 salary to 175% while the terms of the long-term incentive plan are to change. Charles Gurassa, chair of the remuneration committee, said: \u201cThis change to his remuneration arrangements will ensure that his remuneration package will be more market competitive, subject to delivering the board\u2019s performance objectives, and the approach ... remains consistent with the overall philosophy of operating with below-market fixed levels of pay\u201d. Shareholders will be asked to vote on the changes to the remuneration policy. Shareholders of major companies voted on remuneration policies \u2013 which outline pay deals for three years \u2013 for the first time this year, alongside the remuneration report which covers pay in the most recent financial year. McCall \u2013 a former chief executive of the Guardian\u2019s parent company, Guardian Media Group \u2013 will have to hold shares worth 200% of her salary, up from 175% now.",

    "webTitle": "Latest Qatari bid still too low, says Canary Wharf owner", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Canary Wharf owner Songbird has dismissed as too low a \u00a32.6bn cash bid from Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and a North American property firm to take full control of the company. Songbird shareholders have two months to decide whether to accept their \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d offer, increased from \u00a32.2bn. The improved bid came 90 minutes before a regulatory deadline on Thursday and cannot be increased again. The board of Songbird said the new offer did \u201cnot reflect the full value of the company, its unique position and future growth potential\u201d. It pointed to a recent independent valuation that estimated its net asset value at 381p a share, up 19% since June as a result of an upturn in property values. But the board will pore over the bid\u2019s 40-page document in the next week before deciding whether to recommend the offer to shareholders, and will write to investors to set out its views in detail. The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), Songbird\u2019s biggest shareholder with a stake approaching 29%, and US-listed developer Brookfield offered to pay 350p a share, after their initial 295p offer was rejected last month. Claiming that the other side did not want to engage, the bidders took their offer directly to shareholders on Thursday, and have to send them the offer document within 28 days. The other main investors are Glick Entities, Simon Glick\u2019s property empire, which owns nearly 26% of Songbird; the China Investment Corporation, an investment arm of the Chinese state, which owns 15.8%, and Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, with an 8.5% stake. The US hedge fund Third Avenue, which holds 3.5%, has agreed to accept the revised offer. Miranda Cockburn, an analyst at Oriel Securities, said: \u201cWhilst we believe 350p is still too low and doesn\u2019t attribute any value to the future prospects or management (it sounds as if they would wish to retain the existing key management), ultimately the shareholders have to decide whether they want to take the liquidity now or continue to invest in the longer-term outlook of what is arguably a unique estate at Canary Wharf. This will depend on their individual time horizons and alternative opportunities. If the offer is rejected by shareholders, the shares will inevitably slip back to reflect, once again, the messy capital structure.\u201d The Canary Wharf financial district in east London has a complicated ownership structure. Songbird owns 70% of Canary Wharf Group, the owner of the estate, while Brookfield holds a 22% stake. Songbird is expanding the Docklands estate for the first time since the banking crisis, with plans for a 3,000-home estate at its eastern edge, called Wood Wharf. It also owns large chunks of the Walkie Talkie skyscraper in the City and the Shell Centre on the South Bank, which it co-owns with QIA subsidiary Qatari Diar. The QIA, which owns a string of high-profile assets in London including Harrods and the Shard, became a major shareholder of Songbird in 2009 when it stepped in to stop the business collapsing under debt. The disused Docklands were turned into a second financial district to rival the City of London after 1987, when Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, asked Canadian tycoon Paul Reichmann to take on the ambitious building project. Reichmann, who died last year, had delivered a similar project in Manhattan, but the London scheme forced his company Olympia &amp; York into bankruptcy in 1992. Three years later, he received backing from wealthy investors including Saudi royal prince Abdulaziz Al Saud to buy back Canary Wharf from the banks, only to lose out to Songbird in the bidding war for Canary Wharf Group in 2004.

      "bodyText": "Small businesses have called for an end to \u201cunfair\u201d payment practices after it was revealed that one of the UK\u2019s biggest food manufacturers had requested money from suppliers to keep doing business with the firm. Premier Foods, maker of Oxo stock cubes, Ambrosia custard and Mr Kipling cakes, asked for payments totalling millions of pounds from suppliers across the country, according to a BBC Newsnight investigation. The Federation of Small Businesses said the revelations were only the latest example of bad payment practices stretching suppliers to breaking point. It said one small business in the south-west had been asked to pay \u00a31,700 to secure its future business with Premier Foods. \u201cPremier Foods should be ashamed of themselves. Driving a hard bargain with your suppliers is one thing, but demanding a cash gift under the threat of delisting, is downright unfair,\u201d said John Allan, FSB chairman. A spokesman for the government\u2019s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: \u201cWe are concerned by recent reports and are consulting to assess the evidence so we can establish what more we can do. We are also consulting on whether the biggest companies should be required to report publicly on whether businesses need to pay to be on their supplier lists.\u201d The furore over the payments to Premier Foods is likely to add momentum to debates under way as part of the small business enterprise and employment bill being discussed in the House of Lords. The shadow small business minister, Toby Perkins, said Labour had proposed legislative changes to stop firms \u201cexploiting\u201d their suppliers, through practices such as late payment and charging companies to be on their supplier list. \u201cThis issue of businesses charging suppliers to be on their supplier list, or changing the payment terms so that suppliers are being paid very late, is a growing problem,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cBusinesses that have a much more constructive, a much more even relationship with their suppliers, are disadvantaged in the face of competition against people who are exploiting their suppliers.\u201d The Institute of Directors said politicians were right to be concerned about the \u201cunacceptable\u201d pay-to-stay deals. In a sharply worded statement the influential City lobby group said defenders of free-market forces should be furious, arguing that such hostile business practices would damage the reputation of corporate Britain and fuel demands for more regulation. \u201cAt a time when public faith in business is painfully low, such unacceptable behaviour puts a bullet in the chamber for those who think the heavy hand of regulation is the only way to change the culture of corporate Britain,\u201d the IoD director general, Simon Walker, said. \u201cIf companies continue to give politicians good cause to intervene, they cannot be surprised when regulations begin to rain down. Holding small businesses and suppliers at gunpoint is a sure way to catch the attention of policymakers and regulators. Premier need to consider their arrangements closely. We encourage them to think of the long-term damage they could be doing to their suppliers, their brands, and business in general.\u201d Retail experts said Premier Foods had not broken the law, but the demands raised questions about business ethics. \u201cSmaller suppliers to the food manufacturing industry typically operate under microscopic margins, meaning that they are extremely dependent on high volume contracts with the likes of Premier Foods, to stay afloat,\u201d said Julie Palmer, a partner and retail expert at Begbies Traynor consultancy. \u201cWith suppliers under constant pressure to slash prices further while accepting unreasonably elongated payment terms, the UK\u2019s largest food manufacturers and retailers need to find a better way of balancing prices with profits, without pushing their suppliers off a cliff.\u201d Premier Foods has also been struggling in recent months, as cash-strapped consumers increasingly turn to discount grocers and supermarkets\u2019 own-brand products. The maker of Bisto gravy and Sharwood\u2019s sauces shocked the City in October when it warned that 2014 profits would be below expectations, an announcement that sent shares tumbling by more than a third. About six weeks after the profits warning, the company wrote to some suppliers, asking them \u201cto make an investment payment to support our growth\u201d. When a supplier raised questions about the payment, Premier said anyone not making payments \u201cwill be nominated for delist\u201d from their supply. One supplier, who has had a contract with Ambrosia for more than 10 years, told Newsnight the demands were like blackmail. \u201cWhat they are saying is: \u2018Unless you pay this money, you can\u2019t do the work.\u2019\u201d Another said: \u201cIt is like a gun held to your head.\u201d A Premier Foods spokesperson said: \u201cWe launched our \u2018invest for growth\u2019 programme in July last year as part of a broader initiative to reduce complexity in support of plans to help turn around the business. This included a commitment to halve the number of our suppliers and develop more strategic partnerships focused on mutual growth. \u201cAs part of the programme, our suppliers are asked to make an annual voluntary investment to help fund our growth plans. In return, our suppliers benefit from opportunities to secure a larger slice of our current business. They also stand to gain as our business grows in the future.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British workers suffered the biggest drop in real wages of all major G20 countries in the three years to 2013, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Labour said the report underlined why the government has been unable to get the deficit down. Chris Leslie the shadow Treasury chief secretary said: \u201cNot only are working people worse off under the Tories, we\u2019re also doing worse than all other G20 economies. On average working people are now \u00a31600 a year worse off since 2010. \u201cAs the Autumn Statement showed, and these figures help confirm, the continuing squeeze on living standards is leading to a shortfall in tax revenues. And this is a key reason why George Osborne has broken his promise to balance the books.\u201d The ILO report reveals that wages in the UK have fallen more than in Italy. The biggest fall in UK wages adjusted for inflation came in 2011, when they fell by 3.5%. In Italy, which was one of the countries hit hardest by the eurozone crisis, real pay fell by \u201conly\u201d 1.9%. This despite the fact that Italy\u2019s economy has been shrinking for three consecutive years now, and unemployment recently hit a record high of 13.2%. To further emphasise the severity of the drop in real pay in the UK, British workers have been squeezed more than in the eurozone economies hardest hit by the recession \u2013 Portugal, Spain and Ireland \u2013 apart from Greece. According to recent data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), wages in the UK fell 1.6% this year compared to 2013, marking a sixth straight year of declining levels of pay. The Bank of England said in its latest quarterly inflation report last month that recent employment growth had been concentrated among young, lower-skilled and lower-paid workers, which was probably dragging down average wage growth. The fall in pay, while acutest among lower skilled workers, has been registered in most parts of the labour market. The ILO notes in its report that weak productivity is a key part of the story in the UK. The paradox is that unlike the economies of Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, the UK has been growing, employment levels are just shy of all an time high, and the unemployment rate has dropped to 6%. More people are working, but are poorly paid and are earning less Low wages are not just an issue of fairness, but are critical in tackling the nation\u2019s finances On Wednesday George Osborne confirmed what everybody already knew. The chancellor missed his most prized target: eliminating the deficit in this parliament. Instead, the deficit stands at around 5% of GDP and more than \u00a390bn will be borrowed by the government this year. Intuitively one would expect that with a growing economy and such high employment the government\u2019s tax receipts would be increasing at a pace with the labour market. Yet, because of the fall in wages, forecasts for income tax receipts have been spectacularly missed. Weaker-than-expected pay growth in Britain has generated lower than expected tax revenues for the government, which in turn has slowed deficit reduction. UK gender pay gap shrinking, but still high Recent ONS figures found that the gender gap in the UK had shrunk to a record low. The ILO research though shows that the difference in pay between men and women in the UK is still much higher than in many other developed economies. The ILO have picked out certain labour market characteristics that explain why there is a split between what men and women earn, such as education, experience and location. Meanwhile, there are several factors that cannot be explained, primarily linked to discrimination. By adjusting to eliminate the effect of the characteristics that can be explained, the ILO\u2019s calculations show that the gap would be eliminated in the many of the economies analysed. In Britain\u2019s case, the gap would indeed drop, but it would still remain among the highest among the countries featured in the ILO study. The ILO\u2019s global wage report shows that wage growth around the world is being driven by emerging economies Patrick Belser, senior economist at ILO and author of the report, said: \u201cIn developed economies, wages have been flat over the last two years. The consequence of that has been slow growth and household consumption. In some countries, like the UK, Italy and Japan, average wages are still below the level where they were before the financial crisis in 2007\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, if you live in an emerging economy, you have probably seen your pay rise, this is particularly the case if you live in China,\u201d said Belser. Real wages in China were growing at a rate faster then 10% a year through to 2009, before slowing slightly. Real-pay growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy was 9% in 2012 and 7.3% last year. Belser said although US workers earn three times as much as Chinese workers, the gap is getting smaller. The Geneva-based ILO said between the early 1980s and the financial crisis, rising inequality had been \u201cparticularly stark\u201d in the UK and the US. Belser said discrimination in the global jobs market remained a problem. \u201cOur report shows that women, migrant workers and workers from other disadvantaged groups frequently earn much less than others, even when they are equally qualified or when they work in the same occupations.\u201d",

On average working people are now \u00a31600 a year worse off since 2010.</p> <p>\u201cAs the Autumn Statement showed, and these figures help confirm, the continuing squeeze on living standards is leading to a shortfall in tax revenues.

The biggest fall in UK wages adjusted for inflation came in 2011, when they fell by 3.5%.

The ILO research though shows that the difference in pay between men and women in the UK is still much higher than in many other developed economies.</p> <p>The ILO have picked out certain labour market characteristics that explain why there is a split between what men and women earn, such as education, experience and location. Meanwhile, there are several factors that cannot be explained, primarily linked to discrimination. By adjusting to eliminate the effect of the characteristics that can be explained, the ILO\u2019s calculations show that the gap would be eliminated in the many of the economies analysed.</p> <p>In Britain\u2019s case, the gap would indeed drop, but it would still remain among the highest among the countries featured in the ILO study. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mean wage gap before and after adjustment in selected economies\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1417709119599/ILO_wages3.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>The ILO\u2019s global wage report shows that wage growth around the world is being driven by emerging economies</h2> <p>Patrick Belser, senior economist at ILO and author of the report, said: \u201cIn developed economies, wages have been flat over the last two years. The consequence of that has been slow growth and household consumption. In some countries, like the UK, Italy and Japan, average wages are still below the level where they were before the financial crisis in 2007\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, if you live in an emerging economy, you have probably seen your pay rise, this is particularly the case if you live in China,\u201d said Belser.</p> <p>Real wages in China were growing at a rate faster then 10% a year through to 2009, before slowing slightly. Real-pay growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy was 9% in 2012 and 7.3% last year.</p> <p>Belser said although US workers earn three times as much as Chinese workers, the gap is getting smaller.</p> <p>The Geneva-based ILO said between the early 1980s and the financial crisis, rising inequality had been \u201cparticularly stark\u201d in the UK and the US.</p> <p>Belser said discrimination in the global jobs market remained a problem. \u201cOur report shows that women, migrant workers and workers from other disadvantaged groups frequently earn much less than others, even when they are equally qualified or when they work in the same occupations.\u201d</p>",

Despite hopes that the building industry would take up the slack as the mining boom ends, the latest Australian Industry Group/Housing Industry Association construction index showed the sector was back in contraction. It dropped 8 points to 45.4 (index readings below 50 points indicate a contraction) in November with activity and new orders down in all areas, including the steepest fall in the pace of house building since March. The survey comes after data this week showed that Australia\u2019s economy was growing at a much slower rate than expected. The Reserve Bank may now come under more pressure to stimulate the economy and on Thursday Westpac became the first of the big banks to reverse its interest rate forecasts, predicting the RBA will cut twice in 2015. The bank joins a growing list of experts tipping the RBA to cut the cash rate from 2.5% to a new record low because of the slowing economy and the value of the Australian dollar, which remains at relatively high historic levels despite falling to US84c. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans had expected the next rate move to be a hike, but now forecasts a cut at the RBA\u2019s next meeting in February, and again in March. \u201cWe now expect the RBA to cut rates further in the early months of 2015 in an effort to bolster domestic demand and lower the Australian dollar,\u201d he said. Evans\u2019 change mirrors that made by AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver, who has also pencilled in two rate cuts in 2015 following Wednesday\u2019s disappointing economic growth figures. A cash rate of 2% was needed to get the Australian dollar down to US75c, he said, following an unexpected slump in commodity prices.
