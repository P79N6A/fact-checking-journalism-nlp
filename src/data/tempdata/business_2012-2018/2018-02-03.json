      "bodyText": "There is little danger this year of voters struggling to differentiate between the two major parties on economic matters. In speeches this week, the prime minister and opposition leader revealed two starkly opposed views on how the economy should be run. Both sides are gearing up for a fight of labour versus capital, and at its core is wages growth and how and when that should be achieved. Since the Keating enterprise bargaining reforms, industrial relations has in some ways involved a bipartisan light touch. Essentially, both parties took the view that governments should play a minimal role and let the employers and unions negotiate in a spirit of good faith. Yes, the Howard government sought to change things with WorkChoices, but even with the Fair Work Act, the belief that flexibility with a safety net was best, remained intact. The spirit of light touch and good faith remained a cornerstone of the system. For Shorten, that system is now broken. Where once, for example, the termination of enterprise agreements was a legal but rarely used option, now it is a standard operating procedure \u2013 forcing negotiations to start not from the previous agreement, but from the award rate. It is also a system that assumed a strong correlation between profits and wages growth, a linkage Shorten would argue is now weakened because of the reduction in union bargaining power through policies and efforts over the past 20 years designed specifically to reduce that power. Shorten is no radical \u2013 in essence he just wants the spirit of the Keating enterprise bargaining system returned. But the more than two decades of light touch has (perhaps unsurprisingly) led to a situation where wages growth above inflation is now seen as generous, rather than expected. Shorten, in his speech at the National Press Club this week, argued his priority was to make \u201cour economy work for all working Australians \u2013 so that people who work hard can get ahead and that people who are doing it tough don\u2019t get left behind\u201d. He promised four initiatives: restoring Sunday penalty rates, a \u201ccrack-down on the exploitation of labour hire\u201d, addressing the reduction of those on enterprise bargaining agreements, and \u201ca new national push to close the gender pay gap\u201d. His focus is clearly on the worker side of the bargaining table. For Turnbull, the system is not only unbroken, it is working as it should. He is that most perfect of Liberal party politicians \u2013 one who preaches for free markets and for governments to get out of the way, and who also legislates to ensure the government gets in the way to skew the market in favour of employers by doing all he can to reduce unions\u2019 ability to negotiate effectively. Where Shorten is making the pitch for governments to get involved to protect workers\u2019 conditions \u2013 even suggesting putting a floor on the minimum wage relative to the median wage \u2013 Turnbull preaches from the same song sheet of the past 20 years, telling the party faithful in Toowoomba on Thursday: \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear about this; the laws of supply and demand have not been suspended.\u201d The prime minister argued that \u201cwages growth will come, because a stronger economy results in more investment, more jobs and more intense competition between employers for workers\u201d. The combination of the ALP\u2019s shift towards a heavier (if still an historically very light) IR touch, coupled with the fight over company tax cuts, has not surprisingly seen companies come out in strong defiance of Shorten\u2019s stance and in favour of the Liberal party\u2019s polices. Company tax cuts will lead to wonderful things, the CEOs would have us believe, and better times for workers will come ... eventually. The CEO of Wesfarmers told the AFR: \u201cWe are committed to giving our people wages growth when the business environment allows. \u201d That is, when they decide it allows. The CEO of Qantas, Alan Joyce, also told the AFR that the company tax cut would allow the airline \u201cevery opportunity\u201d to open up new routes, buy more aircraft and employ more staff. At this point it probably is worth recalling that Qantas paid zero tax in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. The prime minister argues the recent increases in employment prove the government\u2019s policies are working. He told the Toowoomba audience that \u201cour business tax cuts in 2017 helped create a record 403,100 jobs in that year\u201d. And yet two-thirds of those jobs came in health, education and construction \u2013 areas that are largely public-sector based or, in the case of construction, booming due to a massive increase in public infrastructure spending. Shorten argues that the lack of wages growth while profits and employment are growing proves the system no longer works. For Turnbull, it proves nothing other than we need more patience \u2013 supply and demand will ensure it will happen. The economic fight for the next election is well and truly set, and for both sides, wages growth will be the key. Continuing low growth will strengthen the ALP\u2019s case; improved growth will see the government argue that all is well again. And either outcome will likely be a large factor in determining not only whether we go to an election this year, but also the result.",

      "bodyText": "There are measures of how broke the UK has become wherever you look. And it\u2019s not just the public sector that is showing the strain. The vast sums needed to keep up with 21st century developments are also absent from a private sector that has become reluctant to take any big bets without a large slug of government support behind it. Bank of England governor Mark Carney told a House of Lords committee last week that companies were sitting on heaps of cash and when Brexit uncertainty was lifted, would begin to spend it. This spree, he implied, would bring about an upgrade of factory equipment, service sector processes and infrastructure such that Britain\u2019s pre-2008 productivity growth would resume. His comments came with heavy caveats. And Threadneedle Street still predicts a loss of GDP growth against a forecast that has Britain staying inside the European Union. Nonetheless, the message was clear. No one should despair about quitting the EU; an investment boom that consigns the standstill of the last 10 years to history is still possible. However, the evidence for this assertion is alarmingly thin. Most companies with spare cash have preferred to milk their customers, sweat their assets and pass on the proceeds to investors through share buybacks and dividends. That\u2019s not just a UK trend. It can be seen in the US, where large corporations are trumpeting how much of Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts are being spent on wage rises and investment, although these sums are likely to be dwarfed by the amounts passed back to shareholders. Even so, that still provides significant sums of money for investment by the tech giants and a manufacturing sector that has long embraced innovation to compete on the world stage. Just as importantly, US universities provide a backbone of research for the private sector to feed on, and the US government, however distasteful it may be, subsidises the arms and aerospace industries to make them world-beaters. In the UK, a large number of corporations are struggling. That\u2019s not to say they are unprofitable. It\u2019s just that they are in sectors where it\u2019s difficult to make enough money to feel secure about future investment. And that brings us back to the public sector. Seven years of austerity have diminished the Ministry of Defence to a point where BAE Systems ( formerly British Aerospace) must look elsewhere for contracts. The Carillion debacle has shown there is little money to be made in the public sector by highly indebted outsourcing contractors. Rival Capita has already signalled a steep fall in profits. Other big private contractors like Balfour Beatty, Kier, Mitie, Serco and Interserve have all faced problems and not all are yet secure. Car industry suppliers such as GKN are the subject of takeover bids. Major retailers have seen their sales battered by a mix of weak consumer demand and the monopolistic tactics of Amazon as it dominates sales on the web. What\u2019s left? The oil firms BP and Shell have been selling bits of themselves and relying on the climbing oil price for profits. BT, arguably at the fulcrum of Britain\u2019s digital future, is hampered by the black hole in its pension fund from pumping billions into higher-grade fibre-optic cables. Britain\u2019s universities have provided a bright spot during the austerity years. But they have relied on foreign students paying through the nose and domestic students paying with government-sanctioned borrowing. Foreign students are becoming harder to find and domestic fees need to rise at the very moment that public sentiment has turned against having them at all. Vice-chancellors report a squeeze on their budgets that prevents them taking part in Britain\u2019s recovery. The UK is expert at boxing clever to give a show of modernity without spending vast sums of money. Compare its infrastructure with Spain\u2019s, which has undergone a revolution in the last 20 years at enormous cost. Madrid has put in place one of the world\u2019s largest high-speed rail networks, more international airports than any other European country and an ultra-fast broadband network of fibre-optic cables that reaches 31 million premises \u2013 more than France, Germany, the UK and Italy combined. The UK has pushed its rail system to the limit with better diesel trains and incremental track improvements. BT has delivered enough broadband capacity through the copper network to satisfy the demand for on-demand TV and gaming. And the answer to a lack of airport capacity is not regional international airports, most of which Madrid has mothballed. Ducking and diving is the UK\u2019s destiny until austerity ends in the middle of the next decade. The hope must be that the country doesn\u2019t look too broke when that time comes.",

      "bodyText": "A wintery midweek night in Manchester, and the tables are buzzing at Mackie Mayor with about 500 punters devouring Italian stone-baked pizzas, beef short-rib on toast and salted caramel chocolate brownies. Once Europe\u2019s largest fresh produce market, the building lay derelict for decades before finding a new life last autumn as a haven for foodies who dine communally at long tables set among ornate pillars under vaulted glass ceilings. It\u2019s not alone. Old tube stations, dilapidated market halls and empty shops are being revitalised by a new generation of food halls which combine the excitement of locally sourced street food with the finesse of top chefs. The UK, it seems, is taking a tip from Europe, and the premium food on offer in historic markets such as Barcelona\u2019s Boqueria or Madrid\u2019s Mercado de San Miguel which have become tourist attractions in their own right. In south London, Brixton and Tooting\u2019s once down-at-heel covered markets are now buzzing with dozens of tiny eateries and bars which host tourists and locals alike. Yorkshire pudding wraps, jerk chicken and monthly night openings helped attract 400,000 more visitors to the 161-year-old Kirkgate Market in Leeds last year and when Altrincham\u2019s Market House in Cheshire chucked out the outsized pants and palstic buckets stalls in favour of foodie delights it brought in at least three times the number of visitors and well over \u00a35m in sales last year. Altrincham\u2019s success inspired its operators to open Mackie Mayor. \u201cPeople lust after spending time with other people in real time, eating, drinking, people watching \u2013 they always have and always will, we\u2019re hard wired, it\u2019s part of being human,\u201d says co-owner Nick Johnson. Now big investors are planning to dive in, bringing the once edgy hipster world of gourmet burgers and communal dining onto the UK\u2019s premier high street, London\u2019s Oxford Street. At least 16 new food halls are planned in the capital alone, according to a report by property advisers Cushman &amp; Wakefield, as landlords seek new ideas to rejuvenate town centres where traditional shops have lost their appeal. Time Out Market, the operator of the Lisbon eatery which is now Portugal\u2019s biggest tourist attraction, the street food operator London Union and Italy\u2019s Eataly are vying to cash in on the trend with the start-up Market Halls, backed by property investors and restaurateur Simon Anderson. It\u2019s a new area of growth which comes just as casual dining chains, many of which rapidly expanded with the help of private equity money, face a crisis from rising costs and bored diners. Burger chain Byron, for example, last week announced up to 20 of its outlets were to close as part of a financial rescue plan. Standing amid the dusty chandeliers, grafitti-strewn walls and gloomy black paint of a former tube station ticket hall in London\u2019s Victoria (once the UK outpost of Ibiza\u2019s famous Pacha nightclub), Anderson says the dodgy decor will soon be stripped away to reveal a vaulted ceiling and stained glass windows. By the summer it will host 14 kitchens and three bars, all independent local operators who currently run no more than a handful of outlets. It\u2019s a far cry from shopping mall food courts where corporate behemoths such as Nando\u2019s and Subway reign supreme. Anderson says there\u2019s now a thirst for variety as chefs and restaurateurs now have a fanbase much like pop stars, with people \u201cwanting to try every new dish and go to every pop up\u201d. \u201cFood has really changed its position in the psyche of the nation. It is much more important to people now and is the biggest area people spend on. Food is the new rock \u2018n\u2019roll and we are just providing the stage,\u201d says Anderson. Market Stalls is planning to open at least three food halls in London this year which combine communal dining areas with nearly 50 kitchens and eight bars between them. A further two in London and others outside the capital are also being considered. The first to open in April will be a 10,000 sq ft site in the former Walham Green tube station in Fulham. Victoria is scheduled to open in the summer followed by a 36,000 sq ft temple to street food in part of the former BHS flagship store just off Oxford Street. A market with butchers, bakers and a cheesemonger on the ground floor will be topped off by two floors of dining. The defunct store\u2019s lighting and childrenswear departments will now host long dining tables served by several kitchens as well as a demo kitchen with charming views onto Cavendish Square. Time Out is also looking at more than one site in London. The company, which opens its second establishment in Miami, Florida, this year and outlets in Chicago and Boston next year, is also hoping to open in a Victorian stable building opposite Spitalfields Market in east London. The site is currently held up in a planning wrangle, but Julio Bruno, chief executive of Time Out Group, says it has at least two more sites under consideration in London and hopes to be operating in the capital soon. \u201cWe are democratising fine dining. Some of the best known chefs in the country want to be part of this,\u201d he says. Bruno says foodie attractions are taking off as local councils and landlords realise they need to pull in punters with experiences as big retailers disappear. \u201cThe thing that brings people together as a community is something like Time Out Market. Where else do you meet now if everybody is online?\u201d he asks. But Johnson says the Altrincham and Mackie Mayor recipe is not easily replicated by big companies or local councils. \u201cThe thing about corporates is they lust after \u2013 and will never achieve \u2013 a sense of authenticity and honesty. They want to create a narrative that simply doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he says. \u201cAll our vendors are passionate and independent. We are originators. It\u2019s an antidote to brand mentality.\u201d",
