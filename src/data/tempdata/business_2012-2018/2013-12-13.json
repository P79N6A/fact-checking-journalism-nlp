      "standfirst": "Despite dishing out a \u00a328m mis-selling fine, the Financial Conduct Authority doesn't seem interested in accountability", 
      "body": "<p>Two questions stand out from this week's \u00a328m slap on the wrist for Lloyds Banking Group. First, how could anybody of seniority at Lloyds in 2010 or 2011 have thought it a good idea to threaten staff with demotion if they didn't meet a quota for stuffing customers with investment products? Second, why doesn't the Financial Conduct Authority think it important to find out who at the bank approved and encouraged a crass incentive scheme that also offered \"grand in the hand\" bonuses to super-salesmen?</p> <p>Remember the context. In late 2009 Lloyds, freshly bailed-out by the state, had completed its takeover of HBOS. It was a moment to impose common standards on the new banking beast and recognise that those newly minted pledges about treating customers fairly would require a dose of caution.</p> <p>Yet managers in January 2010 introduced revamped schemes that offered pots of gold and promotion to salesmen who helped to meet group targets, and threatened the lazy and the scrupulous with demotion and pay cuts. A 10-year-old could have spotted the danger that mis-selling would follow.</p> <p>By March 2011 the bank had yet another prompt to examine itself. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio had arrived as chief executive and, in almost his first act, declared that Lloyds' past mis-selling of payment protection insurance, or PPI, was a grave wrong that had to be put right. So best to ensure the same thing couldn't happen again, right?</p> <p>Not exactly \u2013 or not immediately. The incentives farce ran until March 2012. The only relief, from Lloyds' point of view, is that the stock market rose and most of the equity-based products did well. Thus the bill for redress should be modest. In that regard, Lloyds was lucky.</p> <p>\"The findings do not make pleasant reading,\" said Tracey McDermott, the FCA's director of enforcement and financial crime. Yes, but your analysis is not impressive either. The FCA doesn't seem interested in identifying who at Lloyds ordered, or approved, the absurd incentives. In a 35-page report, no names are mentioned. The closest the regulator comes to acknowledging that decisions are taken by people is this passage: \"Retail Finance had overall responsibilty for the process, including reviewing and challenging the sales plan and approving the final sales targets. This was subject to supervision and approval by senior management and relevant committees.\"</p> <p>Senior management? Relevant committees? What does that mean? Is Helen Weir, head of retail banking until 2011 and now finance director at John Lewis, ultimately responsible? Should Archie Kane, head of the insurance side, carry some of the blame? How about former chief executive Eric Daniels?</p> <p>Was Horta-Os\u00f3rio, having spotted the seriousness of the PPI scandal, at fault for not ordering an immediate review on incentives in March 2011? Should chairman Sir Win Bischoff have intervened? Did the non-executives on the remuneration committee, led by Anthony Watson, bother to explore incentives outside the boardroom?</p> <p>Don't ask the FCA or Lloyds, it seems. Instead, shareholders, and the outside world, will have to wait until next spring to learn whose bonuses for 2010, if anybody's, Lloyds claws back. Weir, for example, may still have about \u00a3300,000 outstanding from her 2010 award.</p> <p>In an era when it is agreed that greater boardroom accountability is an important way to make banks behave better, the Lloyds tale is a classic case of responsibility being lost in the wind. The same applies to the \u00a328m fine that Lloyds accurately says \"is not expected to have a material impact on the group\". Feeble.</p> <h2>RSA chief quits</h2> <p>Farewell Simon Lee, we hardly knew you. Two years into the job, the chief executive of RSA has had to walk the plank. There can be no complaints: three profit warnings in six weeks, a dividend in peril (again) and the emergency dispatch of \u00a3135m across the Irish Sea requires a resignation.</p> <p>RSA's shares have plunged almost to levels seen a decade ago, when investors were wondering whether the old Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance could ever be successfully welded together. Asbestos claims and a weak stock market didn't help either.</p> <p>Andy Haste, Lee's predecessor and boss, completed the welding job and, in 2010, confidence was so high that he could make a cheeky approach to Aviva to buy its non-life business. That now seems a long time ago. After the surge in Irish whiplash claims, plus alleged \"accounting irregularities\" in the Irish unit, RSA is definitely a seller, not a buyer of businesses. That's what \"optimising the group's business portfolio\", as chairman Martin Scicluna puts it, means.</p> <p>A radical remedy would see one of the crown jewels \u2013 the Canadian and Scandinavian divisions \u2013 depart. Or perhaps RSA's need for capital can be met with minor disposals plus a rights issue and a dividend cut. A rights issue is \"not our current plan\", says Scicluna, keeping his options open.</p> <p>At this stage, that's the only possible position to adopt. Scicluna, thrust into an executive role, first has to get to the bottom of the crisis in Ireland, still a mystery to shareholders. Then he has to determine how much capital RSA requires and find a chief executive. It's a long to-do list.</p> <p>If would-be bidders for RSA emerge along the way, one suspects shareholders will demand that Scicluna talk to them. Investors are understandably weary.</p> <h2>Manchester United going down</h2> <p>Would you say Manchester United, the New York-listed company, is worth 20% more than it was a year ago? Minus a long-serving managerial genius, and with the club standing 9th in the Premier League, it is hard to understand why the shares trade at $17, (about \u00a310) versus the $14 at which the Glazer family sold a 10% stake in August last year.</p> <p>United may yet scramble into a top-four slot this season, ensuring qualification for next year's Champions League, which is where the big bucks are earned. But, even if they do, it's obvious that a hefty bill will have to be paid in the transfer market to improve the squad.</p> <p>In the age of Gareth Bale, for whom Real Madrid paid \u00a385m, being a forced buyer of top-end footballing talent is not a comfortable position. The Glazers have paid down a lot of debt since their leveraged buyout in 2005, but the company was still carrying net borrowings of \u00a3300m at the end of June this year.</p> <p>Hedge funds, such as Odey, are taking short positions in the shares. There are no open goals in the shorting game, but this one looks attractive. United's stock market value is $2.78bn (\u00a31.7bn). When total revenues are just \u00a3400m-ish, and staff routinely consume half, the valuation looks too rich for a business facing a major capital expenditure programme.</p> <h2>Turbulent airports commissioner</h2> <p>Get ready for another round of the great runway debate. It should be worth watching because Sir Howard Davies, head of the airports commission, may have an opinion that ministers, and the Mayor of London, do not like.</p> <p>Davies will unveil his interim report on Tuesday. As a rule, interim reports skirt around their subject and leave everything up for grabs. Davies may not play ball. He seems determined to advance only a few options for a new runway or runways.</p> <p>If they all involve expansion at Heathrow, there will be panic in government ranks. Ministers were hoping the politically-toxic issue could be ignored until after the 2015 election, which is when Davies' final report is due. If a new Thames estuary airport gets a thumbs-down, watch Boris Johnson explode.</p> <p>The view here is that Gatwick is the way to go. Far more important, though, is that Davies says what he actually thinks. Reports of last-minute political lobbying to expand the shortlist are alarming.</p>",

The same applies to the \u00a328m fine that Lloyds accurately says \"is not expected to have a material impact on the group\". Feeble. RSA chief quits Farewell Simon Lee, we hardly knew you. Two years into the job, the chief executive of RSA has had to walk the plank. There can be no complaints: three profit warnings in six weeks, a dividend in peril (again) and the emergency dispatch of \u00a3135m across the Irish Sea requires a resignation. RSA's shares have plunged almost to levels seen a decade ago, when investors were wondering whether the old Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance could ever be successfully welded together. Asbestos claims and a weak stock market didn't help either. Andy Haste, Lee's predecessor and boss, completed the welding job and, in 2010, confidence was so high that he could make a cheeky approach to Aviva to buy its non-life business. That now seems a long time ago. After the surge in Irish whiplash claims, plus alleged \"accounting irregularities\" in the Irish unit, RSA is definitely a seller, not a buyer of businesses. That's what \"optimising the group's business portfolio\", as chairman Martin Scicluna puts it, means. A radical remedy would see one of the crown jewels \u2013 the Canadian and Scandinavian divisions \u2013 depart. Or perhaps RSA's need for capital can be met with minor disposals plus a rights issue and a dividend cut. A rights issue is \"not our current plan\", says Scicluna, keeping his options open. At this stage, that's the only possible position to adopt. Scicluna, thrust into an executive role, first has to get to the bottom of the crisis in Ireland, still a mystery to shareholders. Then he has to determine how much capital RSA requires and find a chief executive. It's a long to-do list. If would-be bidders for RSA emerge along the way, one suspects shareholders will demand that Scicluna talk to them. Investors are understandably weary. Manchester United going down Would you say Manchester United, the New York-listed company, is worth 20% more than it was a year ago? Minus a long-serving managerial genius, and with the club standing 9th in the Premier League, it is hard to understand why the shares trade at $17, (about \u00a310) versus the $14 at which the Glazer family sold a 10% stake in August last year. United may yet scramble into a top-four slot this season, ensuring qualification for next year's Champions League, which is where the big bucks are earned. But, even if they do, it's obvious that a hefty bill will have to be paid in the transfer market to improve the squad. In the age of Gareth Bale, for whom Real Madrid paid \u00a385m, being a forced buyer of top-end footballing talent is not a comfortable position. The Glazers have paid down a lot of debt since their leveraged buyout in 2005, but the company was still carrying net borrowings of \u00a3300m at the end of June this year. Hedge funds, such as Odey, are taking short positions in the shares. There are no open goals in the shorting game, but this one looks attractive. United's stock market value is $2.78bn (\u00a31.7bn). When total revenues are just \u00a3400m-ish, and staff routinely consume half, the valuation looks too rich for a business facing a major capital expenditure programme. Turbulent airports commissioner Get ready for another round of the great runway debate. It should be worth watching because Sir Howard Davies, head of the airports commission, may have an opinion that ministers, and the Mayor of London, do not like. Davies will unveil his interim report on Tuesday. As a rule, interim reports skirt around their subject and leave everything up for grabs. Davies may not play ball. He seems determined to advance only a few options for a new runway or runways. If they all involve expansion at Heathrow, there will be panic in government ranks. Ministers were hoping the politically-toxic issue could be ignored until after the 2015 election, which is when Davies' final report is due. If a new Thames estuary airport gets a thumbs-down, watch Boris Johnson explode. The view here is that Gatwick is the way to go. Far more important, though, is that Davies says what he actually thinks. Reports of last-minute political lobbying to expand the shortlist are alarming.",

    "webTitle": "FTSE 100 falls for sixth week in a row on Federal Reserve concerns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After a failed attempt at a rally on Friday, leading shares fell for the sixth week in a row, the FTSE 100's worst run since June 2008. The finger of blame was pointed firmly across the Atlantic, with investors increasingly nervous that the US Federal Reserve might begin trimming its $85bn a month bond buying programme at next week's meeting, earlier than previously thought. Growing evidence of a revival in the US economy could force the Fed's hand, particularly since it is due to be Ben Bernanke's last policy get-together before handing the chair over to Janet Yellen. An agreement last week over the US budget was another factor which could prompt the Fed to begin tapering its stimulus package, which has been one of the main factors behind the surge in global stock markets so far this year. So the FTSE 100 finished at 6439.96, down 5.29 points on the day and 112 points lower on the week. That marked its lowest level since 10 October. RSA Insurance led the fallers, down 7.2p to 92.5p after its third recent profit warning and the departure of chief executive Simon Lee. Aggreko dropped 34p to \u00a315.16 ahead of an expected trading update from the temporary power supply business on Monday. In a sell note, Numis said: Due to the lack of contract wins and a weaker dollar/pound we have reduced our forecasts to below the bottom end of the range for 2014. Despite the positive long term outlook we believe the shares are fully valued on 20 times our new 2014 forecasts and we continue to see the shares under performing. We lower our target price to 1,234p from 1,400p. Among the day's risers, chipmaker Arm added 29p to \u00a310.01. It announced the acquisition of Geomerics, whose lighting technology has been used in best-selling computer games such as Battlefield 3 and 4, and Medal of Honor: Warfighter. Angle, the medical technology minnow, received \u00a36.2m to account for its 31% stake in Geomerics and loans to the business. Angle ended 1.8% higher at 81p. Also boosting Arm were reports that Google could be planning to design its own server processors using the company's technology. But the news did not stop analyst Janardan Menon at Liberum repeating his sell recommendation: [The Google report] is likely to be supportive for Arm's share price. In reality we do not think it makes a significant difference as there are a large number of chip vendors already making Arm-based server processors and trying to sell them to end customers like Google. After Thursday's 12.5% plunge in the wake of disappointing profits and a cautious outlook, Sports Direct International recovered some ground, up 28p or more than 4% to 702p. Elsewhere AstraZeneca added 60.5p to 3518.5p after positive news on its pipeline of drugs. A diabetes treatment developed by Astra and Bristol-Myers Squibb, dapagliflozin, has been recommended for approval by an advisory panel to the US Food and Drug Administration. The move comes two years after it was rejected by regulators on safety grounds, saying there was not enough clinical data. Separately Astra announced positive results from a late stage clinical trial of an experimental gout drug, lesinurad. However it is awaiting results from three further trials before assessing its commercial potential. Meanwhile Perform, the sports rights company which slumped on Thursday after it warned on earnings, added 35p to 215p. Royal Mail, set to join the FTSE 100 on 23 December, closed up 4.5p at 589.5p. On speculative front, Weir was lifted early in the week on talk the pumps group could be a bid target for the likes of General Electric or Swiss oilfield service and equipment company Weatherford. But on Friday it suffered some profit taking, and fell 19p to \u00a320.56 after reaching \u00a321.32 on Tuesday. Finally TalkTalk Telecom, down 4.4p to 281.3p, has been mentioned in the past as a possible target for Vodafone, 2p lower at 226.65p. But analysts at Berenberg poured could water on the idea. Their reasons included: A move by Vodafone to buy TalkTalk would likely be a catalyst for the other fixed-line players to buy UK mobile operations. This would leave Vodafone with the weakest market position, given TalkTalk's inferior customer base, infrastructure position and content position. If anything, this could invite a greater threat to its mobile business. TalkTalk would be a very pricey acquisition, for a structurally higher churning customer base and with far fewer synergy opportunities than Vodafone was able to justify with its Kabel Deutschland acquisition in Germany. The final, and maybe most compelling, point is that we see AT&amp;T as a far more likely acquirer of Vodafone than Vodafone as an acquirer of TalkTalk. In our recent Vodafone upgrade, we put the probability of an AT&amp;T acquisition at two thirds, and this event would likely preclude any Vodafone move in the UK.",

And while many countries have got used to wages declining in real terms since the Great Recession, Ireland's workers have had to swallow outright declines in pay, even before the impact of inflation \u2013 at the same time as the housing nest egg they may have been counting on evaporated before their eyes. Second, unlike in Iceland, where there has been large-scale debt forgiveness, consumers and the government in Ireland are still carrying the burden of debts built up during the property boom and the banking crisis, which will weigh on growth for many years to come, and leave the economy vulnerable to currents beyond Dublin's control. The average household has debts worth twice its annual disposable income \u2013 well above levels usually considered dangerous. And third, the markets' relaxed approach to Ireland could evaporate very quickly in the face of a new bout of turmoil elsewhere in the eurozone. The triggers could be many and various \u2013 a hitch in plans for banking union; US tapering pushing up bond yields across the board; a political crisis in one of the other bailed-out member states. In calm times, investors are meticulous about differentiating one debt-burdened state from another; in a crisis, those distinctions can rapidly become blurred. In leaving the clutches of the IMF without a safety net, Ireland has taken a bold decision. Only time will tell whether it is justified or reckless.",

Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>After years of covering the eurozone crisis, it's a pleasant change to watch two politicians talk about ending a financial assistance programme, rather than tumbling into one</strong>.</p> <p>But while finance minister <strong>Michael Noonan</strong> and public expenditure minister&#xa0;<strong>Brendan Howlin</strong> were upbeat, there was no triumphalism on display. And rightly not, given the pain in recent years. And the struggles to come.&#xa0;</p> <p>And we shouldn't forget the Ireland will still be paying the bailout back for many years after it ends on Sunday.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Here's some key points from the briefing</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>It's not just the end of the bailout that's historic</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/13/ireland-prepares-to-exit-bailout-business-live#block-52aae994e4b008af53c5c3b7\"><strong>Howlin suggested</strong></a> the Irish banking crisis was the most dangerous time for Ireland since the state was created (in the 1920s). By the end, Noonan had declared it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/13/ireland-prepares-to-exit-bailout-business-live#block-52aaf253e4b008af53c5c3bf\"><strong>the worst since the Famine</strong></a> (mid-19th Century).</p> <p>As with the famine, the emigration seen in recent years could scar Ireland for many more years unless it can lure people back.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ending the bailout is \"not the end of the road\".&#xa0;</strong>Ireland has already announced a new round of spending cuts and tax rises for next year, in the 2014 budget announced recently. Noonan was clear that further cuts lie ahead if Ireland is to lower its deficit to 3% by 2015.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This isn't the end of the road. This is a very significant milestone on the road...But we must continue with the same types of policies.</p> </blockquote> <p>( <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/13/ireland-prepares-to-exit-bailout-business-live#block-52ab0a53e4b008af53c5c3d3\"><strong>Civil servants have already been outlining the cuts to the world's media</strong></a>).</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>But it's goodbye, almost, to the Troika.</strong>&#xa0;The financial markets can be a nasty place when you lose the confidence of investors. But one good thing about bond traders is that they just want their money back (<em>with a profit</em>). They don't also tell you how to run your country.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/13/ireland-prepares-to-exit-bailout-business-live#block-52aae814e4b008af53c5c3b6\"><strong>The eurozone has changed a lot since 2010</strong></a>.&#xa0;Noonan reminded the press conference that three years, the idea of forcing losses from failed banks on senior creditors was anathema. Now it's official policy. Too late for the Irish taxpayer - who must keep hoping for some retrospective help for taking 'one for the team' in 2011.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/13/ireland-prepares-to-exit-bailout-business-live#block-52aaf109e4b008af53c5c3be\">Kick a politician where it really hurts - in the ballot box</a>.&#xa0;</strong>Chanting on the streets wins headlines and gets the media attention (<em>guilty, M'Lud</em>), but the message from Ireland is that if you really want to make your leaders suffer, you kick them out of office. Hard.</p> <p>Brendan Howlin has got the message, talking about the democratic riot in 2011 when the government was thrown out on its ear.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Better times bring new problems, especially for coalitions.&#xa0;</strong>Noonan and Howlin maintained a united front today, but there's clearly the danger of a rift between the two coalition partners over fiscal policy.</p> <p>The centre-right Fine Gael is inclined towards cutting income tax; Labour favours increased spending. The classic political tussle, which couldn't take place while the Troika were calling the shots.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/13/ireland-first-country-exit-eurozone-bailout\"><strong>Henry McDonald's news story from Dublin is being updated now.</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>And on that note, I'm going to suspend the blog.

Labour minister defended the Irish minimum wage of which the IMF-EU Troika were \"not huge fans.\"</p> <p>She says that the foreign economic experts were shocked and astonished when they had to pay \u20ac50 to \u20ac60 just to see a doctor because they kept picking up colds and flu while on constant flights into Ireland.</p> <p>It was then they understood why a minimum wage was needed to help those in work in Ireland who have to pay huge costs for medical treatment including visits to their GP, Burton says.</p> <p>In the early days of the three year bail out programme Burton says the Troika had a single approached spelled out in three letters - CUT.</p> <p>One of the aspects of Irish social welfare she agreed with the Troika on was the need to reform the system from a \"passive social welfare system into a public employment service to help to get people back to work and education.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Henry explains</strong> the political ramifications of the end of the bailout programme :</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Politically, for Labour this bailout exit will be some comfort to a party that has taken a hammering in the opinion polls over the last three years.&#xa0;</p> <p>Its support has plunged to below 10% in recent polls and only a significant and tangible turnaround in economic fortunes could save it from heavy losses in the next general election.&#xa0;</p> <p>Despite leaving the bail out programme, Bruton stresses that \"We have to have a continuing tightness on finance.\"</p> <p>There will be, she predicts, a \"modest prosperity\" in Ireland rather than a return to the heady days of the Celtic Tiger boom when the country gorged on cheap credit and invested in an overheated property sector.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p

      "bodyText": "Update: we've just launched an open thread where readers can discuss Ireland's bailout exit. It's here: http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/13/ireland-exit-bailout-government After years of covering the eurozone crisis, it's a pleasant change to watch two politicians talk about ending a financial assistance programme, rather than tumbling into one. But while finance minister Michael Noonan and public expenditure minister Brendan Howlin were upbeat, there was no triumphalism on display. And rightly not, given the pain in recent years. And the struggles to come. And we shouldn't forget the Ireland will still be paying the bailout back for many years after it ends on Sunday. Here's some key points from the briefing \u2022 It's not just the end of the bailout that's historic. Howlin suggested the Irish banking crisis was the most dangerous time for Ireland since the state was created (in the 1920s). By the end, Noonan had declared it was the worst since the Famine (mid-19th Century). As with the famine, the emigration seen in recent years could scar Ireland for many more years unless it can lure people back. \u2022 Ending the bailout is \"not the end of the road\". Ireland has already announced a new round of spending cuts and tax rises for next year, in the 2014 budget announced recently. Noonan was clear that further cuts lie ahead if Ireland is to lower its deficit to 3% by 2015. This isn't the end of the road. This is a very significant milestone on the road...But we must continue with the same types of policies. ( Civil servants have already been outlining the cuts to the world's media). \u2022 But it's goodbye, almost, to the Troika. The financial markets can be a nasty place when you lose the confidence of investors. But one good thing about bond traders is that they just want their money back (with a profit). They don't also tell you how to run your country. \u2022 The eurozone has changed a lot since 2010. Noonan reminded the press conference that three years, the idea of forcing losses from failed banks on senior creditors was anathema. Now it's official policy. Too late for the Irish taxpayer - who must keep hoping for some retrospective help for taking 'one for the team' in 2011. \u2022 Kick a politician where it really hurts - in the ballot box. Chanting on the streets wins headlines and gets the media attention (guilty, M'Lud), but the message from Ireland is that if you really want to make your leaders suffer, you kick them out of office. Hard. Brendan Howlin has got the message, talking about the democratic riot in 2011 when the government was thrown out on its ear. \u2022 Better times bring new problems, especially for coalitions. Noonan and Howlin maintained a united front today, but there's clearly the danger of a rift between the two coalition partners over fiscal policy. The centre-right Fine Gael is inclined towards cutting income tax; Labour favours increased spending. The classic political tussle, which couldn't take place while the Troika were calling the shots. Henry McDonald's news story from Dublin is being updated now. And on that note, I'm going to suspend the blog. We'll re-open it if there are any major developments. Thanks for all the comments (well worth a read as ever). GW. The politicians have departed Government Buildings to their constituencies, with Michael Noonan heading off to his native Limerick this evening (Henry McDonald writes) But the top civil servants who run their departments are briefing the world's media on how savings and cuts will continue even in the absence of the IMF-EU Troika. Public sector trade unions have made an agreement to protect jobs by reducing the state's pay bill, they said. Top officials across various Irish government departments have revealed that \u20ac1bn will be taken off the pay and pensions bill in the state sector. The main opposition party in the Republic broadly welcomed the news that the IMF and EU Troika officials were flying home, reports Henry McDonald. Fianna F\u00e1il Finance spokesman Michael McGrath described Ireland's exit from the bailout programme as a significant milestone for the country. However, he warned that there are significant challenges ahead for the economy. McGrath said the country will continue to be subjected to \"extensive external surveillance\" by the Troika and by other international parties to ensure that the economic recovery beds down and takes root firmly. Henry adds: Generally speaking Fianna F\u00e1il has backed the radical cost cutting measures imposed by the IMF-EU over the last three years. The party that once dominated Irish politics have to tread carefully because the public - both at the 2011 general election and still to this day - blame their profligacy while in government from 1997 for fuelling the credit boom that led in part to the crash. Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin, says it's too early to declare Ireland's economic problems over: He told Reuters: They have to be prudent. You can't just cut taxes for the sake of it. It's a good story for the EU and it's a good story for us (but) we're still at the mercy of global factors. Here's Press Association's take on the press conference to mark the end of Ireland's bailout (see 10.40am onwards for highlights). The heroes and heroines of Ireland's international bailout programme were the ordinary people, the country's finance minister has said. As the once financially-crippled nation marked its exit from the EU/IMF \u20ac85 loan programme, Michael Noonan said those who have suffered the most were the hundreds of thousands who lost their jobs and homes, and young people who were forced to emigrate. \"The real heroes and heroines of the story are the Irish people,\" Mr Noonan said. \"They have had their taxes increased, they have had their services cut drastically, some of them including public servants have had very serious pay cuts. \"Everybody has had cuts in their pensions as well. But they have continued to supported the Government.\" The country will officially exit the programme on December 15 and re-enter the money markets. Ireland's finances, budgets and policies have been under intense scrutiny since the country agreed to a massive loan package in 2010. Its debt masters, a Troika of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank and European Commission, have carried out 12 intense reviews over the last three years and imposed a series of tough targets. All of which were met by the state. Eamon Gilmore, the leader of Ireland's Labour party (and the country's foreign and trade minister) , has echoed Michael Noonan and Brendan Howlin by acknowledging how the Irish people have suffered since 2010: The final question is delivered in Irish Gaelic -- the reporter helpfully explains that he's asking about retrospective bank recapitalisation. As the minister replied in Irish Gaelic (quite right too), I don't know what he said. Sorry. That's the end of the press conference. Presumably the press pack will be racing to book a restaurant for tonight.... Brendan Howlin's description of Ireland's 'democratic riot' in 2011 amused one Irish hack in the press conference, reports our own Henry McDonald: One of the local journalists raises an alternative explanation to our German colleague asking once again why the Irish failed to riot during the crisis unlike their Greek or Spanish counterparts. \"Because we are too f****** lazy!\" This produces some sniggers but Minister Howlin believes there was a democratic riot in the ballot box back in 2011 when the previous Fianna F\u00e1il government sustained the heaviest electoral defeat in its history. While there some truth in this latter explanation as well as the patriotism of the Irish people in the face of the crisis, economic reality dictated there would be no widespread disorder in the streets, argues Henry: Most people had too much invested in terms of property (much of it in negative equity), personal debt and jobs (or lack of them) to be rioting and causing disturbances in the state. The Republic has proven itself to be a stable albeit relatively conservative nation in the way it dealt with the crash, the bail out and the loss of economic sovereignty. The German media are out in force in Dublin -asking why there were no riots during the bailout, as seen in other crisis-hit countries? Howlin says that Ireland had a democratic riot -- in 2011 when the people threw out the government and elected the current coalition. The senior partner in the government (Fianna F\u00e1il) was \"not only put out of office but devastated\", and its junior partner (the Greens) was completely obliterated. People had their venting, their riot, but they did it in the polling booth. And that message has not been lost on us. Howlin suggests that the Irish people weren't prepared to put their heads in the sand, or pretend there was a magic formula. Maybe we are used to setbacks, he adds. \"But we knew that this crisis would bring us down unless we addressed it.\" Over to Henry again: The Finance Minister compares the crisis as the greatest since the Famine when millions died in the mid 19th century potato blight and millions emigrated from British ruled Ireland. Earlier his colleague Minister Howlin had compared the crash and the bail as the worst period since the Irish state was founded after 1921. Michael Noonan pays tribute to the sacrifice made by the public since Ireland suffered \"the biggest crisis since the famine\". Another question about whether anything has really changed by the end of the bailout. Aren't we just 'celebrating' three years of austerity? Howlin explains that they key difference is that Ireland will no longer be bound to a single lender, which could make clear demands in return for providing funds. Asked about the eurozone's growth prospects by a reporter from a German newspaper, Brendan Howlin replies that Germany could do its bit to help --- he hopes that the next Berlin administration will help to stimulate its own domestic economy. Does Ireland hope that its credit rating could be returned to investment grade? Michael Noonan points out that Moody's is the only agency that rates Ireland as 'Junk' - we'd hope that they take another look at us in the new year. He adds that Ireland is now borrowing at lower interest rates than when it had a AAA rating. Ratings are one thing, but the way markets work can be different he adds (a polite way of suggesting we shouldn't flap about these dratted rating agencies?) He's right too -- Ireland can borrow at just 3.5% per annum for 10 years, according to its bond yields. A reminder that the press conference is being streamed here. Phil Aldrick of the Times asks whether Ireland will still need hefty budget cuts in the years ahead despite leaving the bailout. Noonan confirms that it will -- saying ' we are committed to further fiscal consolidation', to get the deficit down to 3% by 2015 (that's the target set by Brussels) Back on tax, and Noonan reiterates that his party is keen to lower income tax, but realises that the overall tax burden cannot be cut. Brendan Howlin reiterates that the reform agenda will continue. He will announce new public sector reforms in January. This second wave will focus on delivering better services for citizens, he adds. More from Henry, on the minister's answer to his question on Ireland's domestic demand: Finance Minister Michael Noonan sounded upbeat about rising consumer demand, which has been one of the weakest sectors of the Irish economy since the crash. Noonan insisted that demand was building up again and that the exit from the bail out would increase general confidence in consumers. He said all the data indicated that people are prepared to spend more. His Cabinet colleague Brendan Howlin quipped \"try booking a restaurant tonight in Dublin\" when asked about the weakness of consumer spending in the domestic economy during the crisis. Oh, and Henry assures me he'd never dare to expense a meal in a swanky Dublin eatery -- some prices give the impression that the crisis never happened. Do the ministers have advice for other countries who are still in bailouts? No, not particularly, Noonan replies. Spain has exited its programme too (which gave support for its banks), he says. There's a lot of confidence that Portugal will exit in 2014. Slovenia also looks capable of fixing its banks without needing international help. The Greek position is getting better. And Ireland is exiting its bailout this weekend. The phase of additional European countries going into [bailout] programmes, and the countries in programmes having concerns over their situation, is over. The eurozone is quite strong again Huge changes have taken place since we started addressing our own problems in Ireland The euro is worth holding onto, and it will deliver prosperity in the future, Noonan concludes. A question from my colleague Henry McDonald -- how will leaving the bailout programme end the \"consumer chill factor\" and stimulate domestic demand? \"Try and book a restaurant in Dublin tonight\", shoots back Brendan Howlin (put it on expenses, Henry!). In other words, consumers are spending again. Michael Noonan also claims there is an upturn -- saying VAT receipts are above target at present. But the Irish finance minister also concedes that any optimism is wafer-thin - and could be snapped by another crisis overseas. The recovery is fragile now, he says, it would be easy to scare people. \"Any international event could stop what's happening\". Does the end of the bailout programme mean there will be more political tensions between the coalition partners? Brendan Howlin says that Labour's relationship with Fine Gael in the current coalition is the best he has known in his career. He says that the government, elected in 2011, walked into an existential crisis over Ireland's future --which was \"probably the worst crisis\" since the creation of the Irish state itself. There will be lively debate over the future of Ireland, he adds. Noonan agrees, saying he wants to work with opposition parties as well as Ireland faces the future. There can be no repeat of the years before the boom: We can't go mad again. Even if we had the resources it wouldn't be the right way to go. Next question: Was Jean-Claude Trichet unfair when he blocked Ireland's plan to \"burn senior bondholders in 2011\", and is Dublin's relationship with Mario Draghi (who replaced Trichet as current ECB president) better? Noonan replies that when the eurozone crisis began, the people in senior positions were the people who had helped design the single currency, and struggled to change their view. They were averse to change. Trichet felt that senior bond holders were untouchable -- Ireland disagreed, but couldn't persuade him. Today, though, the eurozone has changed its position and now believes creditors (not taxpayers) should pay when a bank fails. He say Trichet was still a good central bank governor, but hails Draghi's for his new approach - giving a \"fillip\" to the eurozone. It also helps that there is closer fiscal integration. Noonan says he's also confident that Ireland can bring its national debt down towards the eurozone average. Some early reaction from Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald: It is interesting that Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has repeated the \"heroes\" theme first raised by his Cabinet colleague Richard Bruton earlier this morning. \"The real heroes and heroines are the Irish people,\" Minister Noonan said close to the start of the press conference in Government Buildings. It will be a theme accentuated throughout this weekend right up to the Taoiseach's speech to the nation live on television on Sunday evening. The Fine Gael-Labour coalition are doing humble in recognition of the pain the Irish people endured without Greek-style protests or mass demonstrations Spanish-style in the face of austerity cuts. By praising the populace as \"heroes and heroines\" the government are hoping they can appeal to the stoical patriotism that has partly resulted in no widespread social disorder in the face of the cuts imposed by the IMF-EU Troika. Another question -- for Brendan Howlin (the Labour minister). There has been talk from (Fine Gael's) Michael Noonan about tax cuts, but where would you like to see spending raised? Howlin seems keen to avoid a disagreement -- saying it is too early to think in detail about the issue, but he'd like to see more help for hard-working, coping families. Noonan chips in too- saying his party still see tax cuts as an instrument to create economic growth. We need to get credit flowing in the Irish economy, says Noonan. Noonan adds that the government's key focus now is to grow the economy to create \"jobs for our people\". On to questions - the first from a Danish journalist -- how will things change on Monday? Things won't change straight away, Michael Noonan replies. But people will know that their politicians will be taking decisions on their own, rather than in partnership with the Troika. Brendan Howlin also says Ireland must make reforms to become a more open economy,. We have a lot of work to do, but we can take the next steps with confidence.... he adds. Howlin says the bailout exit is \"a huge testament to the fortitude and forbearance\" of the people of Ireland, and their determination \"to put things right for them and their children\". Future generations owe them a huge debt, he says. Now, expenditure minister Brendan Howlin speaks - saying that in 2010 many people never though this day would come. Noonan says the worst suffering has been experienced by those who lost their jobs in the last three years, and those who were forced to leave the country to find work. We want to encourage our very bright emigrants too come back, he adds The real heroes and heroines of the Irish bailout story are the men and women who have coped with spending cuts, tax rises and other measures implemented over the last three years. This isn't the end of the road, but it is a very significant milestone on the road. Ireland's deficit is still too high, and so is the debt - it needs to be made 'even more sustainable;. Finance Michael Noonan begins, saying Ireland has completed over 270 actions since signing up its bailout three years ago. He says he doesn't want to look back, but reminds the press conference that the previous government had to seek help when it was locked out of the markets. The bailout allowed Ireland to make adjustments over four years, not overnight, he adds. The press conference on Ireland's bailout exit is underway, with Michael Noonan and Brendan Howlin taking their seats,.... Looks like the BBC News website will be streaming this morning's press conference on Ireland leaving its bailout, here. Dublin correspondent Henry McDonald has been hearing from another cabinet minister, this time Labour's minister for social protection, Joan Burton (Labour are the junior partner in the coalition with Fine Gael) Burton has given some interesting insights into the relationship between her and the IMF-EU Troika officials who for the last three years have overseen the running of the Irish economy. The Labour minister defended the Irish minimum wage of which the IMF-EU Troika were \"not huge fans.\" She says that the foreign economic experts were shocked and astonished when they had to pay \u20ac50 to \u20ac60 just to see a doctor because they kept picking up colds and flu while on constant flights into Ireland. It was then they understood why a minimum wage was needed to help those in work in Ireland who have to pay huge costs for medical treatment including visits to their GP, Burton says. In the early days of the three year bail out programme Burton says the Troika had a single approached spelled out in three letters - CUT. One of the aspects of Irish social welfare she agreed with the Troika on was the need to reform the system from a \"passive social welfare system into a public employment service to help to get people back to work and education.\" Henry explains the political ramifications of the end of the bailout programme : Politically, for Labour this bailout exit will be some comfort to a party that has taken a hammering in the opinion polls over the last three years. Its support has plunged to below 10% in recent polls and only a significant and tangible turnaround in economic fortunes could save it from heavy losses in the next general election. Despite leaving the bail out programme, Bruton stresses that \"We have to have a continuing tightness on finance.\" There will be, she predicts, a \"modest prosperity\" in Ireland rather than a return to the heady days of the Celtic Tiger boom when the country gorged on cheap credit and invested in an overheated property sector. Heads-up: Ireland's finance minister, Michael Noonan, and minister for public expenditure, Brendan Howlin, will hold a briefing on Ireland's bailout exit in around 15 minutes time (at 10.30am GMT). It should be streamed online here. Among the Irish business figures welcoming the bailout exit is Colm Tracey, the founder of 'eishtech', a call company centre based in Waterford and Wexford. In 2010 the Belfast born entrepreneur was made redundant when Talk Talk pulled out of its Irish operation resulting in 575 job losses. He will soon employ 950 workers of his own by the middle of 2014, he reveals. I was forced to take on contract work in London and had to fly every Monday morning on the red eye from Dublin airport. But my partners and I have turned it around after we started trading with our own company in 2011 and started winning contracts from British telecoms companies. Tracey's experience of the banking system is unlike many of his counterparts who complain that the bailed out banks are not lending money to SMEs, saying: Our banks work with us I'm pleased to say, I can't speak for anyone else. The Irish finance ministry has tweeted a timeline of the last three years: A German journalist has just asked Irish employment minister Richard Bruton why the Irish did not go out and riot on the streets like their counterparts in Greece and Spain (reports Henry McDonald from this morning's press conference). Bruton replies that most people understood that in an economy that relies on exports they accepted the challenges of austerity. He says there was a \"patriotism in the way people approached this crisis.\" Richard Bruton, the Irish Employment minister, is pointing to Ireland's strength in the hi-tech and food sector as evidence of the Republic exporting its way out of the crisis. Speaking inside the government buildings a few minutes ago, Bruton says the government has created a \u20ac2.5 billion in loans for new businesses to fill the void created by Irish banks reluctant to lend to SMEs and entrepreneurs. Bruton described enterprises and workers as the \"true heroes\" who battled their way through the economic crisis. He said that the fact Intel's new chip was manufactured in Ireland was a \"mark of the journey\" Ireland had been on over the last three years. The minister said that over the last year there had been a 4% increase in private sector employment but acknowledged that unemployment was still high at 12.5% of the overall workforce. On the taxpayer rescued Irish banks, Bruton accepted that the banking sector are \"not lending to the levels that we would like.\" He said bank refusal rates on loans to business are still high compared to other parts of Europe. Bruton however stressed that refusal rates over the last two and a half years had fallen from 30% to 20%. The banks are some of the biggest hate figures among the general population after tens of billions of euros were pumped into a sector that got into lethal debt levels because they were leading vast sums to builders and property speculators. Among those attending a government breakfast briefing in Dublin were a number of entrepreneurs who have kept doing business throughout the stormy atmosphere of the last few years (writes Henry McDonald). They include Dr Kieran Curran, the 33 year old CEO of Gencell Biosystems which supplies genetic testing for big pharma companies in the United States. Dr Curran employs 40 graduates at his plant in Limerick City which he established in 2011 in the middle of the IMF-EU bail out programme. A creator of real jobs in the economy, he insists that the bail out exit will have tangible effects on his business which he is trying to grow across the planet. Dr Curran explains: \"We were in China last month and were asked about the state of Ireland. And we were able to tell that our country is managing its debt, that it is financially competent. These things matter in potential markets such as China.\" He also has a family story that is typical of so many Irish SMEs across the state during the economic crisis. His family run a windows and doors construction company which after the 2007-2008 crash had to downsize their workforce from 65 to 20. However Dr Curran said there has been a \"real turnaround\" in the family's business this year. \"They have now got the workforce back up to 55 and in the last three months there has been a noticeable upturn in business,\" Dr Curran adds. Back to Ireland, where opposition politicians are warning that the country faces tough times despite the end of the bailout. Sinn Fein's Finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said that while the Troika of IMF, EU and European Central Bank officials were leaving Dublin, \"the Troika mindset remains firm in government buildings\". Doherty predicted that there would be further austerity cuts long after the bail out programme was over and the Troika was gone. \"They bailed out the banks and unfortunately over the three years it was the Irish people that suffered.\" Confirmation that the eurozone economy remains fragile: the Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency has reaffirmed Italy's credit rating at BBB with a negative outlook. That means a one in three chance of a downgrade next year. S&amp;P said: Italy's growth prospects remain weak, while the net general government debt burden continues to be among the highest of all the sovereigns we rate. This tweet also gives a sense of the mood in Ireland today, as it looks beyond its \u20ac85bn bailout. Sir Christopher Pissarides, who won the economics Nobel prize in 2010, said the bailout exit is a \"great moment\" for Ireland. He believes its government should be congratulated for completing the programme on time. But Pissarides also disputes that Ireland's experience proves that the eurozone's medicine of hefty fiscal cutbacks can work, as its crisis was caused by its banking sector - not its wider economy. We should regard Ireland as a country that can give lessons on the banking sector...\u2026. but it is not a good example of how to reform the economy as they we did not need to reform the Irish economy too much. Michael O'Sullivan from Credit Suisse also pointed to the mounting social problems in Ireland, telling the Today Programme that: Ireland is a lesson - no country would want to go through what we've seen in the last three or four years. Radio 4's Today Programme has also been covering Ireland's bailout exit. Gavin Hewitt, the BBC's Europe editor, reports that some eurocrats are already using it as an example that Brussels' approach to the crisis can work. As Hewitt put it said: Some EU officials are already saying - look, Ireland can do it. But he also points to the social impact -- with homelessness up, and fears that the poorest 10% in Ireland have lost a fifth of their income. Sky News's Ed Conway has summed up the economic picture in Ireland today: The currency is still intact, despite real fears, culminating last summer, that it would face implosion. And the economic numbers are starting, finally, to turn in Ireland's favour. But it's hard to revel in this when you take even a moment to examine the plight of the country. Whether you view it in statistical or human terms, Ireland has faced a genuine depression over the past six years. Between 2008 and the end of 2010, the country's economic output - in other words the amount of income its entire economy generated - shrank by a tenth. House prices halved since 2007 - a bigger fall than has been seen in any developed economy in recent memory. If the property market was the engine for the economy before the crisis, it is now essentially non-existent. More here: Ireland Struggles On Brink Of Bailout EU commissioner Olli Rehn reminded Ireland last night that their path into austerity began when the last government took the fateful decision to guarantee its banking sector's huge toxic debts. That's via my colleague Henry McDonald, who sets the scene in Dublin: A host of government ministers, the CEOs of several major Irish companies and the head of the country's Industrial Development Authority are lining up to talk up the impact of the Republic exiting the bail out programme this weekend. On this unseasonably mild but dark December morning in Dublin, the ministers are holding a series of briefings to explain what leaving the IMF-EU multi billion euro programme means not only for Ireland but the whole of the Eurozone. Ahead of a momentous weekend the EU's vice-president Olli Rehn told RTE television last that one of the biggest mistakes of the previous government led by Fianna F\u00e1il was to grant a blanket guarantee to shore the country 's debt ridden banks - one of the key parts of the economy that promoted Ireland to go cap in hand to Europe and the IMF. Despite restoring economic sovereignty there is no sense in Dublin or across the state of any euphoria over exiting the bail out. With consumers, many of them in negative equity due to the disastrous property crash of 2007-2008 , still reluctant to spend let alone borrow, the population remains cautious about its finances and its future. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Ireland is poised to make history this weekend, becoming the first eurozone country to exit a bailout. Three years after signing up for an \u20ac85bn rescue deal and painful austerity plan, Ireland will leave the programme behind on Sunday night. It's a genuinely notable moment for a country that has swallowed swingeing spending cuts, tax rises and slashed wages since its banking sector spectacularly imploded in winter 2010. The Dublin government insists that the fundamental problems of the Irish economy have been fixed, leaving the country now facing a positive future. By some measures, the programme was a success -- Ireland is no longer locked out of the international markets, and can borrow again. But behind the satisfaction, Ireland still faces tough economic problems -- having finally struggled out of recession earlier this year. And the human cost of the austerity demanded in return for the bailout has been huge. Around 300,000 people have left the country since 2010, and the unemployment rate has risen over 12%. The poster child of Europe's response to the crisis may be back on its feet, but it will be walking gingerly for some time. Various events are taking place in the Irish capital over the next few days to mark the moment. Finance ministers will hold a press conference later this morning, where they could outline a mid-term economic strategy for the next three years. We'll be tracking the developments in Ireland, and beyond, through the day.....",

      "bodyText": "It's an American import popularised by Hollywood 'A' listers on the red carpet and offering a mind-boggling choice of silhouette-smoothing slips, knee-length \"britches\" and even full-length leggings to suck in bulging tummies and over-generous thighs. Now UK retailers say sales of body-shaping underwear or \"shapewear\" have soared in the run-up to Christmas as women (the men's market is tiny) try to look their best in figure-hugging party outfits. Department store John Lewis has reported a 150% increase in sales of the US brand Spanx alone \u2013 which promises shoppers that they've \"got your butt covered\". Other retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer, Topshop, Asda and Sainsbury's have followed suit with a range of more affordable items and are also reporting strong sales ahead of office parties and other seasonal celebrations. Body-gripping shapewear has evolved from unflattering flesh-coloured Bridget Jones-style pants and eye-wateringly tight lycra (or spandex) to breathable girdles, waist-cinchers and strapless bodies. Jo Hooper, head of womenswear at John Lewis, said state-of-art technology such as bonding and laser-cutting has \"transformed\" the product by banishing the seams, hems and bulky fastenings which have traditionally stood in the way of a streamlined silhouette. Improved fabrics also help the body to \"breathe\", while special shaping zones target specific problem areas.

She cut the feet off a pair of tights and caused a commercial revolution in the lingerie world. The Spanx range set tills ringing in the USA following the personal endorsement of Oprah Winfrey, since then the fashion for tight-fit 'body-con' dresses on both sides of the Atlantic has made shapewear \u2013 with many copycat brands \u2013 a universally popular trend. High Street and online retailer Debenhams has seen a 10% increase in shapewear sales on the same time last year and a near doubling of sales between October and November this year in the run-up to the festive season. And at Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 which sells 120 own-brand items of shapewear in its lingerie department \u2013 sales have increased by 75% in December Soozie Jenkinson, M&amp;S's head of lingerie design, said: \"In the three weeks before Christmas, we expect to sell an amazing 10 shapewear items per minute as women prepare for the party season\"",

    "webTitle": "Irish whiskey industry launches fresh assault on Scotland's dominance", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With Ireland restoring its fiscal sovereignty this weekend, it is a sign of emboldened economic confidence that the country's whiskeys are launching a fresh assault on Scotland's domination of the trade. In a bucolic corner of the County Kerry coastline, pub chain owner Oliver Hughes has opened one of a few independent whiskey distilleries in Ireland. Hughes, who has weathered the recession since the 2008 Celtic Tiger crash, hopes that his investment in a new whiskey will coincide with a general economic upturn and growth in export markets. Irish GDP grew by 0.9% last year, but this was boosted by the output of multinationals with significant operations in Ireland, including Intel, Facebook and Google. Once the takings of foreign firms and the interest paid to overseas investors are excluded, the measure is as much as \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn), or 18%, lower. Nurturing a home-grown whiskey industry is one way of trying to plug that gap. On a break from work at the Dingle Distillery, Hughes says he has noticed an improvement in footfall and consumer spending in his Porterhouse pubs in Ireland. The chain, which brews its own beers, also includes Porterhouses in London's Covent Garden and Manhattan, New York. \"Definitely in the last few months, particularly Dublin has had a very vibrant tourist trade. Lots more tourists are coming through our doors and yes, there does seem to be a few more bob around the place in general from Irish punters too,\" he says, adding that last year's turnover for his Porterhouse Group was around \u20ac30m. Inside the distillery, where casks include a special first edition set called Dingle Founding Fathers, yours for more than \u20ac6,000, Hughes says it's time for Irish independent distillers to challenge Scotland's hegemony. \"It's a winner, an absolute winner. Of course, it's a labour of love for me but so was creating Ireland's first micro-brewery back in the early 1970s. With the demand for Irish whiskey out there in the world this is a no-brainer. \"The key markets are obviously the US and the emerging ones like India and China. My personal view is that the big spirit brands such as Jameson, made by Irish Distillers, will grow into those markets, but there will be space for the small, independent specialist distilleries like ourselves.\" Within three years of his first casks maturing, Hughes says he will hope to roll out between 150,000 to 200,000 cases of 12 bottles a year. On top of the whiskey, the Dingle Distillery is already producing its own branded vodka and gin. Enterprise Ireland, the body that promotes indigenous small-to-medium Irish businesses around the world, predicts Irish whiskey sales will double over the next five years. Ed Mooney, Enterprise Ireland's head of beverages, says there is a \"whiskey renaissance\" in terms of new distilleries opening over the next few years across the republic. \"The investments going on in Dingle and in other distilleries like one aimed for Shane Castle are highly significant in terms of creating subsidiary jobs and the expenditure put into them. \"The jobs projections over the next five years would be an increase in direct work in the distilleries from 800 employees to up to 1,400,\" Mooney said. When Irish prime minister Enda Kenny opened up a new production plant for Irish Distillers earlier this year in Middleton, County Cork, he was presented with a bottle of Jameson from 1992. The taoiseach promised that he would open it up and enjoy a tipple on the day Ireland exited the IMF-EU bailout. Kenny will have to wait another three years to sample a drop of Dingle Distillery's brand. Meanwhile inside his Kerry-based distillery, where the grain used in the stills is recycled as cattle feed for a local farm, Hughes is optimistic not only about his own investment but about the overall economy. \"Anyone who goes into business is an optimist. I remember a few months ago my wife saying to me in exasperation, 'Oliver, in your life the glass is always half full.' To which I replied, 'Not only is it half full but I have actually ordered another glass.'\" A short history of Irish whiskey \u2022 The international popularity of Irish whiskey declined after the 17th century when, unlike the Scots, Irish distillers failed to modernise their stills. \u2022 The Irish version suffered another blow in the 1920s when bootleggers labelled their illicit drink \"Irish whiskey\" \u2022 US soldiers who arrived in Britain and Northern Ireland when America entered the second world war in 1941 sampled the delights of Scotch and were cut off from consuming Irish whiskey as the Republic was neutral \u2022 The formerly state-owned Cooley Distillery near the border with Northern Ireland was soldin 2012 to American whiskey giant Jim Beam. Its successful sale by then owner John Teeling has prompted renewed interest and venture capitalist investment in new small distilleries across the Republic.",

    "webTitle": "Low interest rates to continue well into 2015, Bank of England speech indicates", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Interest rates will stay low until Britain enjoys a prolonged period of strong growth, a Bank of England policymaker has said in a speech indicating that historically cheap credit will remain in place well beyond next year. Spencer Dale, the Bank's chief economist, said the weakness of the UK economy and the threat of further shocks to the world economy meant Threadneedle Street would want to see a combination of strong growth, low unemployment and rising incomes before raising rates. His trinity of targets is likely to be welcomed by mortgage payers given the flurry of reports that the Bank will be forced to raise rates next year to calm the current growth spurt. The likelihood is that while growth has already begun to accelerate, wages are unlikely to begin rising above the rate of inflation until 2015 and only consistently by 2016 when the Bank expects unemployment to fall to its target of 7%. Addressing a group of business leaders, Dale said the recent optimism could not be taken for granted. \"Events of the past few years may colour and contaminate business behaviour for many years,\" he said. In particular, he suggested that \"the reluctance today of some companies to borrow from their banks may be less a lack of demand and more a breakdown of trust\", which adversely effects \"the efficient functioning of our economy\". His comments echo the stance taken by the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, who has dismissed concerns that it would need to respond to rising house prices with higher rates. Dale said the housing market had a tendency to behave like a microwave, \"turning from lukewarm to scalding hot in a matter of a few economic seconds\", but argued that the central bank is \"far better equipped to respond to these types of risks than in the past\". To counter underlying fears among many business people, who have proved reluctant to invest in new equipment and technology since the financial crash, interest rates must remain low. Dale said: \"You can plan for the future in the knowledge that the MPC [the Bank's monetary policy committee] intends to keep interest rates low until we've seen a prolonged period of strong growth, unemployment is significantly lower, real incomes are higher.\" He added that his best guess is that such conditions for raising rates remain \"some way in the distance\".",

Arm shares have added 42p to \u00a310.14, making it the biggest riser in the leading index. But the news has not stopped analyst Janardan Menon at Liberum repeating his sell recommendation:</p> <blockquote> [The Google report] is likely to be supportive for Arm's share price. In reality we do not think it makes a significant difference as there are a large number of chip vendors already making Arm-based server processors and trying to sell them to end customers like Google. <br> So Google's move to design chips for its own internal consumption is unlikely to materially change the market share equation. It is also unclear if Google actually wants to go ahead with such an expensive design process when Arm-based semiconductor suppliers exist, or if it is putting this speculation in the market to reduce prices of both Intel and Arm-based processors. In any case we forecast Arm to take about a 20% share in the web-server market in coming years and believe this is already priced into Arm's share price. Also, contrary to previous expectations we do not expect Arm-based processors to make any material traction in the server market in 2014, with this now being pushed out to 2015. Arm's core smartphone and tablet markets are slowing down and rapidly moving low-end, putting pressure on Arm's royalties. Intel is also taking share in the tablet market. The stock is expensive. </blockquote> <p>After Thursday's 12.5% plunge in the wake of disappointing profits and a cautious outlook, <strong>Sports Direct International</strong> has recovered some ground, up 19.5p or nearly 3% to 693.5p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is down 6.27 points at 6438.98, as concerns grow that the US Federal Reserve may begin to trim its $85bn a month bond buying programme next week, given recent positive US data and, at long last, signs of a budget agreement.</p> <p><strong>RSA Insurance</strong> is leading the fallers, down 19.3p at 80.3p after its third recent profit warning and the departure of chief executive Simon Lee.</p> <p><strong>Aggreko</strong> has dropped 34p to \u00a315.16 ahead of a trading update on Monday, after a sell note from Numis.

Arm shares have added 42p to \u00a310.14, making it the biggest riser in the leading index. But the news has not stopped analyst Janardan Menon at Liberum repeating his sell recommendation: [The Google report] is likely to be supportive for Arm's share price. In reality we do not think it makes a significant difference as there are a large number of chip vendors already making Arm-based server processors and trying to sell them to end customers like Google. So Google's move to design chips for its own internal consumption is unlikely to materially change the market share equation. It is also unclear if Google actually wants to go ahead with such an expensive design process when Arm-based semiconductor suppliers exist, or if it is putting this speculation in the market to reduce prices of both Intel and Arm-based processors. In any case we forecast Arm to take about a 20% share in the web-server market in coming years and believe this is already priced into Arm's share price. Also, contrary to previous expectations we do not expect Arm-based processors to make any material traction in the server market in 2014, with this now being pushed out to 2015. Arm's core smartphone and tablet markets are slowing down and rapidly moving low-end, putting pressure on Arm's royalties. Intel is also taking share in the tablet market. The stock is expensive. After Thursday's 12.5% plunge in the wake of disappointing profits and a cautious outlook, Sports Direct International has recovered some ground, up 19.5p or nearly 3% to 693.5p. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 6.27 points at 6438.98, as concerns grow that the US Federal Reserve may begin to trim its $85bn a month bond buying programme next week, given recent positive US data and, at long last, signs of a budget agreement. RSA Insurance is leading the fallers, down 19.3p at 80.3p after its third recent profit warning and the departure of chief executive Simon Lee. Aggreko has dropped 34p to \u00a315.16 ahead of a trading update on Monday, after a sell note from Numis. The broker said: Due to the lack of contract wins and a weaker dollar/pound we have reduced our forecasts to below the bottom end of the range for 2014. Despite the positive long term outlook we believe the shares are fully valued on 20 times our new 2014 forecasts and we continue to see the shares under performing. We lower our target price to 1,234p from 1,400p. Perform, the sports rights company which slumped on Thursday after it warned on earnings, has added 25p to 205p.",

RSA also said it had been hit by additional claims for \u00a325m after the UK and Scandinavia were hit by storms in early December. The result is that profits for 2013 will be reduced further following two profit warnings in a week that the group issued early last month. Scicluna said: \"After November we had less capital than we had before and now we have even less capital.\" He said options included selling businesses and raising money from shareholders in a rights issue but that a cash call was \"not our current plan\".
