That ratio feels too high.</p> <p>First, the Pfizer-related reasons. The US pharmaceuticals group offered \u00a355 per AstraZeneca share in the spring but may have been relying on its tax \u201cinversion\u201d plans to make its numbers stack up. Such tax flips have not been outlawed by the US administration (just made harder) but any new offer might have to structured more like a merger than a takeover to meet the revised rules.</p> <p>An all-share deal in which AstraZeneca\u2019s investors were offered 40% ownership of a new company might qualify, think investment bankers.

      "bodyText": "Neil Woodford, the fund manager, sees a 50/50 likelihood that Pfizer will take another pop at AstraZeneca once the six-month \u201chands off\u201d period expires in a week\u2019s time. That ratio feels too high. First, the Pfizer-related reasons. The US pharmaceuticals group offered \u00a355 per AstraZeneca share in the spring but may have been relying on its tax \u201cinversion\u201d plans to make its numbers stack up. Such tax flips have not been outlawed by the US administration (just made harder) but any new offer might have to structured more like a merger than a takeover to meet the revised rules. An all-share deal in which AstraZeneca\u2019s investors were offered 40% ownership of a new company might qualify, think investment bankers. But that would currently value the UK company at \u00a360-ish. It would be tricky for Pfizer to explain to its own shareholders why it is suddenly prepared to pay so much more.

    "webTitle": "UK grocery sales in decline for first time in 20 years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK grocery sales have gone into decline for the first time in at least 20 years as a raging price war and the falling cost of food commodities hit Britain\u2019s supermarkets. In good news for shoppers, the average price of a basket of everyday essentials such as milk, bread and vegetables now costs 0.4% less than it did a year ago, according to the latest figures from market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. But the figures highlight lean times for the UK\u2019s biggest retailers with all of the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets seeing sales fall back in the 12 weeks to 9 November as the overall grocery market contracted by 0.2% compared with a year ago. Kantar Worldpanel said it was the first time it had recorded a decline in UK grocery sales by value since it began collecting data in 1994. Back then Sainsbury\u2019s was still the market leader but was to be overtaken by Tesco the following year. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel said: \u201cThe major supermarkets have all had a difficult period, hit by both the flow of shoppers toward the discounters and reduced revenues as they competitively cut prices.\u201d Tesco was the worst performer with sales dropping by 3.7%, but Morrisons\u2019 performance deteriorated at the fastest rate, with the slump in sales accelerating to 3.3%, from 1.3% a month ago. Sainsbury\u2019s trading also worsened, with sales down 2.5% while Asda was down in line with the market, enabling the Walmart-owned group to hold its market share. The \u201cbig four\u201d are spending billions of pounds cutting prices in an effort to stem the rate of shopper defections to German discounters Aldi and Lidl. \u201cThe declining grocery market will be of concern to retailers as they gear up for the key Christmas trading season,\u201d continued McKevitt. As the amount of goods shoppers are buying is barely rising while prices continue to fall, he said: \u201cI think it\u2019s likely this pattern will continue until Christmas and into the first half of 2015.\u201d In keeping with a trend that has continued throughout this year, the German discounters Aldi and Lidl continued to grow strongly, as did the up-market grocer Waitrose. But only Waitrose picked up the pace of growth, to 5.6%, shoring up its spot as the UK\u2019s sixth largest supermarket. Aldi\u2019s growth slowed to 25.5% from 29.1% last month - its slowest pace since 2012 \u2013 while Lidl\u2019s growth slowed to 16.8% from 17.7% last month. Last week Asda reported its biggest underlying sales decline in eight years with like-for-like sales down 1.6% in the three months to 30 September. Chief executive Andy Clarke blamed the intensifying price war and a blizzard of discount vouchers for the deterioration. Profits at Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons have also gone into reverse as shoppers rein in their spending, food commodity prices drop in the wake of strong harvests and competition intensifies as a result of the growth of Aldi and Lidl. Further pressure is coming from structural changes in the market such as the growth of online and high street convenience stores in addition to the rise of the discounters, as shopping habits learned during the recession see chains such as Poundland and B&amp;M continue to steal sales from Britain\u2019s mainstream supermarkets. Liverpool based B&amp;M, which listed on the stock exchange in June, told analysts on Tuesday it was in talks with at least six major retailers - thought to include Homebase - to buy underperforming stores. The retailer, chaired by former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, said it planned to open at least 50 stores in the current financial year as it reported a 34% increase in operating profit to \u00a365.8m \u2013 a figure that excludes flotation and other restructuring costs \u2013 in the six months to 27 September. Like-for-like sales rose 4.8%. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said his expectations for the quoted supermarkets over the key Christmas trading period were low. \u201cThe market looks to remain weak, compounded now by falling food prices and rising gross margin pressure ... the biggest challenges the discounters face, to our minds, will be overcrowded car parks and agitation in the shopping aisles rather than competitor attrition.\u201d Market share in the 12 weeks to 9 November: \u2022 Tesco: 28.7% \u2022 Asda: 17.2% \u2022 Sainsbury\u2019s: 16.4% \u2022 Morrisons: 11.1% \u2022 The Co-operative: 6.2% \u2022 Waitrose: 5.1% \u2022 Aldi: 4.9% \u2022 Lidl: 3.5%",

Sainsbury\u2019s trading also worsened, with sales down 2.5% while Asda was down in line with the market, enabling the Walmart-owned group to hold its market share.</p> <p>The \u201cbig four\u201d are spending billions of pounds cutting prices in an effort to stem the rate of shopper defections to German discounters Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>\u201cThe declining grocery market will be of concern to retailers as they gear up for the key Christmas trading season,\u201d continued McKevitt. As the amount of goods shoppers are buying is barely rising while prices continue to fall, he said: \u201cI think it\u2019s likely this pattern will continue until Christmas and into the first half of 2015.\u201d</p> <p>In keeping with a trend that has continued throughout this year, the German discounters Aldi and Lidl continued to grow strongly, as did the up-market grocer Waitrose.</p> <p>But only Waitrose picked up the pace of growth, to 5.6%, shoring up its spot as the UK\u2019s sixth largest supermarket. Aldi\u2019s growth slowed to 25.5% from 29.1% last month - its slowest pace since 2012 \u2013 while Lidl\u2019s growth slowed to 16.8% from 17.7% last month.</p> <p>Last week Asda reported its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/13/asda-says-pulling-away-from-rivals-discounts\">biggest underlying sales decline in eight years</a> with like-for-like sales down 1.6% in the three months to 30 September. Chief executive Andy Clarke blamed the intensifying price war and a blizzard of discount vouchers for the deterioration.</p> <p>Profits at Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons have also gone into reverse as shoppers rein in their spending, food commodity prices drop in the wake of strong harvests and competition intensifies as a result of the growth of Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>Further pressure is coming from structural changes in the market such as the growth of online and high street convenience stores in addition to the rise of the discounters, as shopping habits learned during the recession see chains such as Poundland and B&amp;M continue to steal sales from Britain\u2019s mainstream supermarkets.</p> <p>Liverpool based B&amp;M, which listed on the stock exchange in June, told analysts on Tuesday it was in talks with at least six major retailers - thought to include Homebase - to buy underperforming stores. The retailer, chaired by former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, said it planned to open at least 50 stores in the current financial year as it reported a 34% increase in operating profit to \u00a365.8m \u2013 a figure that excludes flotation and other restructuring costs \u2013 in the six months to 27 September. Like-for-like sales rose 4.8%.</p> <p>Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said his expectations for the quoted supermarkets over the key Christmas trading period were low. \u201cThe market looks to remain weak, compounded now by falling food prices and rising gross margin pressure ... the biggest challenges the discounters face, to our minds, will be overcrowded car parks and agitation in the shopping aisles rather than competitor attrition.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"1994 supermarket market share\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1416335738673/Supermarket-share-1994.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"2014 supermarket market share\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1416335738315/Supermarket-share-2014.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Market share in the 12 weeks to 9 November:</h2> <p>\u2022 Tesco: 28.7%</p> <p>\u2022 Asda: 17.2%</p> <p>\u2022 Sainsbury\u2019s: 16.4%</p> <p>\u2022 Morrisons: 11.1%</p> <p>\u2022 The Co-operative: 6.2%</p> <p>\u2022 Waitrose: 5.1%</p> <p>\u2022 Aldi: 4.9%</p> <p>\u2022 Lidl: 3.5%</p>",

      "bodyText": "And finally, to Greece again where it has been announced that the country\u2019s former finance minister Yiannos Papantoniou has been given a four-year prison term for declaring false revenue claims. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: Yiannos Papantoniou, the man most associated with paving the way to Greece\u2019s adoption of the euro, suffered the ignominy of being handed a four-year sentence by an Athens court after it was discovered that his stated assets differed wildly to the deposits he was found to have stashed abroad. Papantoniou\u2019s wife, Stavroula Kourakou, was also handed a four -year sentence after her name was similarly found on a list of wealthy Greeks (many suspected tax evaders) with holdings at the HSBC bank in Geneva. Commonly known as the Lagarde list, the tally of names has been the source of embarrassment and scandal for leading members of Greece\u2019s political and business elite. The 65-year-old politician was told that the sentences would be suspended until the case is heard by a higher court. Greek politicians, by law, have to make public assets and annual earnings. Corruption is widely seen as a root cause of many of the country\u2019s financial foes and in the five years since Athens\u2019 near-economic collapse. Greeks have loudly complained that almost none of their corrupt political class have been punished for the depredations that pushed Greece to the brink. In the case of Papantoniou there may be worse to come. The wrong-doing goes back to 2009 \u2013 next week he will be tried on charges of having committed the same offense in 2008. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Better than expected German confidence figures, along with hopes of further stimulus for the Japanese economy after the country\u2019s government called snap elections, have combined to help support stock markets. ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s comments on Monday suggesting the bank would do more to support the flagging eurozone if necessary also continued to help the optimistic mood. So by the close, the scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 37.16 points or 0.56% higher at 6709.13 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.61% to 9456.53 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.86% higher at 4262.38 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.71% to 19,352.95 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.2% better at 10,432.9 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 38 points or 0.22% higher. Greece is officially out of recession, according to last week\u2019s growth figures. But does it feel like the long slump is over? Guardian Witness would like to hear from readers in Greece; are you feeling the benefits? Is the Greek economic recovery working for you? Still with the US, and housebuilders in the country have become increasingly confident about the outlook. The National Association of Home Builders said its sentiment index rose to 58 in November from 54 in October, better than an expected reading of 55. The rebound came after the October figure showed its biggest drop since February. Even so, the index has been above 50 for five straight months now, indication more builders believe market conditions are favourable than poor. NAHB chief economist David Crowe said: Low interest rates, affordable home prices and solid job creation are contributing to a steady housing recovery. After a slow start to the year, [the index] has remained above the 50-point benchmark for five consecutive months, and we expect the momentum to continue into 2015. More on the US producer prices, and economists suggest the rise is another sign a rate increase from the Federal Reserve is getting closer. Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said: The rise in the core producer price index [PPI] should alleviate concerns over ongoing declines in US inflation rates. While the PPI is more volatile than the consumer price index (CPI), the latest move strongly suggests that the downward trend in the CPI that began earlier this year, is about to end. This, in combination with ongoing improvements in the labor market and gradually acceleration wage gains, implies that the Federal Reserve is getting closer to its first rate hike. We continue to expect the lift-off for June 2015. More from Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis, who has emerged from talks with the country\u2019s president Carolos Papoulias. Helena Smith reports: Hardouvelis said: \u201cWe are at the end of the economic adjustment programme and from 2015 a new period and a new relationship begin. It must be a friendly relationship, that way all of us will come out as winners. The economy will recover faster in a climate of support from our partners. That will help our effort to go out alone to the markets and borrow with low interests. \u201cAs finance minister I am called upon to protect fiscal stability and to resist populism. I will not allow, whatever passes through my hands, to deceive the Greek people. I am working so there can be an overall, realistic agreement with lenders as soon as possible,\u201d he said of the stalled negotiations. \u201cWe want an agreement that will take the country forward. And we will succeed. But today we need level headedness \u2026. we have to come to an agreement with lenders that is safe for the country.\u201d Greece\u2019s finance minister has confirmed that the government and its lenders are struggling to reach an agreement on the outstanding measures that Athens should take. More inflation data just hit the wires, this time from the US. And producer prices (which measures how much American firms receive for their wares) rose by 0.2% in October. Economists had expected PPI, which feeds through to the headline inflation rate, to drop by 0.1% month-on-month. Core PPI, which strips out food and energy, rose by 0.4% month-on-month. Much of the inflationary pressures appear to be in the services sector, though, where producer prices jumped 0.5%, rather than among goods producers. This latest deadlock between Athens and the Troika comes as Greece\u2019s coalition government tries to nominate a new president to replace the outgoing Karolos Papoulias. As fastFT points out, failure could trigger snap elections: The anti-austerity leftwing Syriza party is currently leading in the polls, so investors fret that elections could once again reopen the can of worms that many hoped had been firmly closed by now. Over in Greece, the debt-stricken country\u2019s relations with its creditors \u2013 though never easy \u2013 appear to have deteriorated, prompting government leaders to hold another emergency round of talks this afternoon. News of the deadlock has hit Greek government bond prices, pushing yields further into the \u2018danger zone\u2019 over 8%. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens Auditors in charge of Greece\u2019s economic recovery programme are saying openly that negotiations with Athens have hit a wall, in yet another inauspicious sign for Europe. Despite denials by the Greek government, officials in Brussels with intimate knowledge of the talks say prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 two-party coalition has been given 48 hours to commit to various measures -- or pay the price of auditors not returning to Athens to complete what was meant to be final quarterly review of the economy. Greece had hoped to wrap the review up in time for the next euro group on December 8th so that euro area finance ministers could begin discussing the possibility of throwing the debt-burdened country a precautionary credit line. That would enable Athens to begin exiting its EU-IMF bailout programme by the end of the year. This now looks most unlikely with officials on both sides describing the negotiations as \u201cextremely complex and tough.\u201d. Deputy prime minister and socialist leader Evangelos Venizelos has said: \u201cIt is evident that there are difficulties and the negotiations are complex and hard.\u201d Venizelos, who heads the government\u2019s junior partner Pasok, will hold talks with Samaras this afternoon after conducting back-to-back meetings in Brussels on Monday \u2013 not least with the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, who yesterday also sent tremors through Greece by ruling out a debt-restructuring any time soon. Insiders say the two men will devise a final road map of policies and priorities in an effort to entice troika mission chiefs to return to Athens. At issue is how to plug a fiscal gap next year (which the troika says is almost three times the \u20ac1bn the government estimates), freeing up professions, overhauling the pension system and streamlining the bloated public sector. Solutions to none of these are easy in a political climate now dogged by ever-worsening factionalism and divisiveness. Mission chiefs, who have been conducting negotiations by email, say they want answers by Wednesday in what the Greek media is describing as a \u201cwar of nerves.\u201d Things are so bad that MPs are demanding that Samaras sits down with the stridently anti-austerity main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras in a bid to find common ground to policies now dividing Greece from the bodies keeping it afloat (both men refuse to talk to one another). Bloomberg is also reporting that talks have stalled, with prime minister Samaras refusing to make extra savings of up to \u20ac2.5bn. They report: Greece\u2019s government and its international creditors are deadlocked over a final round of measures required to release the last tranche of the country\u2019s bailout, two people familiar with the negotiations said. That has pushed the yield on Greek 10-year bonds up over 8.36%, from 8.1% last night: Economists are notorious for arguing, but there\u2019s broad agreement today that Britain\u2019s inflation rate will head south in the months ahead. The Consumer Prices Index rose to 1.3% in October, up from the five-year low of 1.2% set in September (full coverage starts here) Higher computer games prices helped to push up the cost of living, as my colleague Katie Allen reports: Inflation edged higher last month, pushed up by more expensive computer game releases in the run-up to Christmas, but overall price pressures remained low. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the slight rise in inflation reflected the fact fuel prices fell between September and October as oil prices came down, but the drop was smaller than a year earlier. The other upward effect on inflation came from computer games \u201cwhere a number of new titles have been released in the run-up to Christmas replacing cheaper titles in the computer games charts.\u201d The rise likely reflects the arrival onto the market of next generation consoles whose games are significantly more expensive than those for older consoles. The retail prices index, a broader inflation measure including housing costs and used to calculate some pay deals, was up 2.3% on a year earlier, unchanged from September\u2019s rate and as forecast by economists. Christmas computer game releases help UK inflation edge up to 1.3% But with oil and food prices likely to keep falling, Deloitte, the BCC and the EY Item Club have all predicted lower inflation in the months ahead. Despite that, the TUC has renewed its call for real wages to rise, saying it would help the economy and drive up demand. Our economics editor Larry Elliott says there are four good reasons why inflation could fall below 1%: The first is the collapse in the oil price, which is feeding through into lower prices on garage forecourts. A litre of unleaded petrol costs just over 120p a litre. Meanwhile, manufacturers are being helped by crashing commodity prices. Input prices for factories are down by more than 8% year-on-year. The second factor is the intense supermarket price war, where the big retailers are slashing prices to try to retain or win market share. Bad news for profits, good news for consumers. The third factor is the mild autumn. Clothes shops are desperate for a cold snap so they can start shifting their winter stock. Already some of them are offering pre-Christmas discounts; more will follow if it stays mild. Finally, there\u2019s the slowdown in the global economy. Larry Elliott: Why the rise in UK inflation may be a blip in a downward trend In other news: UK house prices rose at the fastest annual rate in seven years in September, but the average price has eased back a little. UK houses slip from record highs, adding to signs of a cooling market UK grocery sales have fallen across the supermarket industry for the first time in decades. German investor confidence has recovered, easing concerns over the eurozone economy (a little). European car registrations have risen for the 14th month running. And Japan\u2019s prime minister has called an early general election, and announced plans to postpose its impending sales tax: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, has joined the ranks of experts predicting that UK inflation will ease back from October\u2019s 1.3%. And that means interest rates will remain at their current record low for some time. \u201cOctober\u2019s uptick in inflation is largely a function of base effects and movements in volatile categories. Otherwise, the inflationary trend is downward and there is a good chance that the CPI measure will drop back again over the next couple of months. \u201cIt looks increasingly likely that inflation will dip below 1% in the early months of 2015, which would lead to a letter of explanation from Mark Carney to the Chancellor. Against this backdrop, and given the increasingly dovish mind-set of the majority of the MPC, it is unlikely that they will even contemplate an increase in interest rates in the near-term. Indeed, the risks are becoming increasingly skewed towards a lengthy period of inaction. \u201cOil is currently trading around $10 a barrel below the October average, suggesting that petrol prices still have some way to fall, while today\u2019s producer prices data suggest that the disinflationary pressures coming along the supply chain are intensifying. With core inflation at just 1.5%, underlying pressures remain subdued. Beck also reckons that this morning\u2019s house price data shows that the Southern England housing market cooling a little: \u201cAlthough this morning\u2019s data show house price inflation being surprisingly resilient at national level, this has masked some interesting trends in the regional data with the earlier strength of London &amp; the South East now subsiding. This cooling in the southern markets is encouraging, as it is a necessary condition for a slowdown in the wider market. We expect to see the ONS series echo other measures in reporting a cooling in the market over the next few months.\u201d Union leaders are disappointed that inflation has risen, matching the average basic pay rises over the 12 months to September. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady warns that real earnings need to rise to help sustain the recovery: \u201cThe first signs of progress on real wages have already been stopped in their tracks. Weak demand remains the big problem facing the British economy. \u201cWith inflation predicted to remain low well into next year, any talk of interest rate rises is dangerously out of kilter with today\u2019s economic situation. It\u2019s higher wages that are needed to boost living standards and sustain growth, not the threat of higher mortgage payments.\u201d The recent fall in the oil price means the UK consumer prices index will remain low for the next year or so, reckons David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce: \u201cAlthough inflation edged up slightly in October, the impact of low oil prices will have a noticeable impact in coming months, causing inflation to drop. We expect inflation to fluctuate around 1.0% until late 2015, before rising towards 2.0% in 2016.\u201d Britain is experiencing a major easing of price pressures, despite the small pick-up in inflation last month, says Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte: Low inflation is likely to ride to the rescue of the UK consumer in 2015, providing vital support for spending and for GDP growth.\u201d Rising inflation is all those young people\u2019s fault, jokes Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale currency expert Kit Juckes. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains why fuel costs pushed inflation up last month, even though the oil price has fallen: Fuel costs and air fares were the main reasons behind the rise. Both have fallen since last month, but this time last year there was an even larger fall between September and October, leading to an upward impact on the year-on-year figures. Brettell adds that the outlook for inflation remains weak. And with few inflationary pressures, the weak eurozone economy, and Japan in recession, he predicts UK interest rates won\u2019t rise until late 2015 at the earliest. The desperate fight for customers between Britain\u2019s supermarkets means Britons can look forward to fuel and food prices continuing to fall. So reckons James Brown, partner at the London office of pricing experts Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners. He says: With no clear signal from the OPEC countries of a cut in oil supply, we see no immediate sign of a price increase. The good news for consumers is that these falls in oil price are being rapidly passed on at the pumps, largely thanks to the spill-over effects from the supermarket price war. And the drop in food prices (down 1.6% over the last year) is likely to continue as established supermarkets battle discount chains (Aldi and Lidl). This [price war] shows no signs of abating, with Sainsbury\u2019s the latest to indicate heavy investment in price cuts. Whilst consumers can expect to enjoy sustained low prices, this will inevitably put pressure on the margins of these supermarkets and their suppliers. Returning to the rise in UK inflation... the Labour Party says the increase in the consumer prices index means Britain is still suffering a cost of living crisis. Catherine McKinnell MP, shadow Treasury minister, says: \u201cWhile Ministers deny there\u2019s a cost-of-living crisis these figures show an unexpected rise in inflation. \u201cWorking people are \u00a31,600 a year worse off under David Cameron\u2019s government because for four years wages have lagged behind price rises. And working people face a further hit if the Tories win the election. They\u2019ve pledged to cut tax credits again and refuse to rule out another VAT rise. \u201cLabour\u2019s economic plan will tackle the cost-of-living crisis and ensure we can earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few at the top. We will balance the books in the next Parliament, but do so in a fairer way - starting by reversing David Cameron\u2019s tax cut for millionaires.\u201d Reminder, we don\u2019t yet know how much wages also rose in the year to October. They may have increased faster than 1.3% (September\u2019s increase). But wages will surely not have matched the retail prices index, the wider measure of inflation, which rose by 2.3% in the last year. Encouraging-ish economic news from Germany -- economic sentiment in Europe\u2019s largest economy has risen this month, and by more than expected. The ZEW institute\u2019s monthly measure of morale has jumped to 11.3, from minus 3.6 in October. That indicates some stabilisation in the German economy, according to ZEW. London\u2019s house price inflation has eased a little, mind, but is still ahead of the rest of the UK. UK house price inflation has hit a seven year high, with the buoyant London market leading the way. The Office for National Statistics reports that UK house prices increased by 12.1% in the year to September 2014, up from 11.7% in the year to August 2014. That\u2019s the biggest rise since July 2007. The ONS says: House prices continue to increase strongly across the UK, with prices in London again showing the highest growth. House price annual inflation was 12.5% in England, 5.8% in Wales, 7.6% in Scotland and 10.9% in Northern Ireland. House prices in the capital were up by 18.8%, but in contrast they only rose by 5.8% in Wales. The ONS also reports that the prices paid by first-time buyers were 13.3% higher in September than a year ago, showing the struggle to get onto the housing ladder: Britain\u2019s supermarket sector has suffered its first drop in grocery sales in two decades, according to data just released: Troubled Tesco suffered particularly badly, with sales down 3.7% followed by Morrisons with 3.3%. Mark Miller, UK analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, also reckons UK inflation will fall back in the months ahead: Going forward, risks remain firmly skewed to the downside amid declining oil prices, emerging signs of another slowdown in global economic activity and subdued wage pressures. We do not envisage a Bank of England interest rate increase until well into the second half of 2015. The pick-up in inflation means Bank of England governor Mark Carney is spared the indignity of writing to the chancellor to explain why the consumer prices index isn\u2019t within one percentage point of his 2% target. But Mr Carney might still need to rehearse his excuses, as inflation could drop back this month. Jeremy Cook, chief economist of World First, says: \u201cIt is almost certain that November\u2019s number is lower than October\u2019s and could easily hit 1%, triggering a letter from BOE Governor Carney to Chancellor George Osborne to explain why. \u201cOf course, the increase now wipes out last week\u2019s wage improvement and tightens pressure on pockets heading into Christmas. Retailers will continue to cut prices heading into the festive period, until decent wage strength allows their margins some breathing room.\u201d The government appears keen to portray today\u2019s inflation report as a good thing. A HM Treasury Spokesperson has said: \u201cThe government\u2019s long term economic plan is working, with inflation falling by three quarters since its peak in September 2011 and pay cheques rising. But the effects of the great recession are still being felt and so we have taken continued action to help with the cost of living, including cutting income tax, freezing fuel duty and reducing the costs of childcare. The job is not yet done and the biggest risk to the recovery would be abandoning the long-term economic plan that is delivering economic security. Liberal Democrat Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, also wants to take some credit: Rising inflation puts more pressure on households. But we don\u2019t know yet whether real wages are still rising, or not. Last week\u2019s unemployment report showed that average wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 1.3% in the three months to September. But we don\u2019t get October\u2019s wage data for another three weeks. Over the last year, food prices are down by 1.6% and prices of motor fuels are down by 4.8%, the ONS says. This chart shows how UK inflation has fallen pretty steadily over the last few years: And this chart shows which items pushed inflation higher last month, and which pulled it back. Why did UK inflation go up to 1.3% last month? The Office for National Statistics says that \u201csmaller falls in transport costs than a year ago \u2013 notably for motor fuels and air fares, and price rises for computer games were the main contributors to the rise in the rate of inflation. But food and fuel prices do continue to fall -- knocking 0.3 percentage points off the Consumer prices index, the ONS says. Here we go! UK inflation rose to 1.3% in October, up from 1.2% the previous month. Details to follow.... UK inflation, a preamble... Just under 20 minutes to go until we get the UK inflation data for October, showing how the cost of living changed last month. In September, the consumer prices index fell to a five-year low, of just 1.2%, well shy of the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. Some economists reckon October\u2019s CPI figures will be unchanged at 1.2%, with falling oil prices continuing to drive down inflation. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, suggests a \u201cdownside surprise\u201d is possible, given a recent survey showed prices falling in the service sector. A soft outcome is likely to pour cold water on BOE rate hike speculation, weighing on the British pound. In other corporate news, EasyJet profits have soared by 22% as the no-frills airline continued to bolster its position as Europe\u2019s second largest budget airline. More here. The word from Japan is that prime minister Shinzo Abe will hold a press conference at 10.10am GMT, to reveal his response to the country\u2019s slide back into recession. Abe is widely expected to postpone the increase in the sales tax scheduled for early 2015, in an attempt to stimulate growth by relaxing his fiscal targets. His advisor has set the scene already, saying it would be natural to delay the hike, despite the need to cut Japan\u2019s debt pile eventually. UK high street retailer John Lewis has reported that Christmas sales are picking up pace, as my colleague Fiona Walsh explains:... One of the UK\u2019s largest property developers has cited the weak European economy, and next May\u2019s UK general election, as key risks to the sector. British Land reported this morning that it has profited from the London housing boom, with net asset value up 11.8% in the last six months. Chief executive Chris Grigg says that demand for quality properties in and outside London is strong. But its outlook statement, British Land says: Looking forward, from a macro perspective, the UK recovery looks more established, interest rates globally are likely to stay lower for longer and investment flows into UK property remain broad and deep. Some risks remain, notably the UK general election next year along with economic conditions in Continental Europe. This broadly echoes the warning in British Land\u2019s annual report from June, so the situation hasn\u2019t improved since. And the company is also concerned by the possibility of Britain leaving the EU: Significant upcoming political events, including the UK General Election in May 2015, bring risks both in terms of uncertainty until the outcome is known and the impact of policies introduced, including on the investment case for the UK, and the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe. This is a hot political topic at the moment. The eurosceptic UKIP party is on track to win the Rochester by-election on Thursday, while David Cameron is committed to offering an in-out referendum on EU membership if the Conservative Party win next\u2019s May\u2019s election. In the City, the turmoil at insurance claims processor Quindell had continued with the departure of three top executives. Quindell told shareholders this morning that chairman Rob Terry and non-executive director Steve Scott will quit with immediate effect. Finance director Laurence Moorse is also quitting the board, and will depart in a year. Shares in Quindell jumped by up to 17% in the early moments of trading in London. Yesterday they tumbled by up to 25%, after it admitted that its financial adviser and joint broker had resigned a month ago. The exodus follows the revelation that the three men had sold shares in Quindell to US group Equities First Holdings, to raise funds to purchase more stock for a management buyout. Terry defended that action this morning, saying: \u201cI entered into the share transactions announced on 5 November 2014, with the best of intentions for the Company and all shareholders and it would have been my intention to acquire more shares were it not for the restrictions due to the discussions leading to this announcement. I am clearly disappointed and sorry that events turned out as they did. General Motors didn\u2019t have a great October, though. Total registrations dropped over 5%, due to the withdrawal of its Chevrolet brand from Europe. French carmaker Renault had a good October, with registrations up 10.5% year-on-year. Germany auto manufacturers did OK too, Volkswagen sales were 6.9% higher than October 2013, while BMW registrations jumped +9.4%. And Italy\u2019s FCA (which includes Fiat) saw registrations rise by 8.4%. The full ACEA data is here (pdf). Car registrations in Cyprus were almost 35% higher in October than a year ago, AECA reports. A total of 707 new vehicles were registered, up from 524 in October 2013, suggesting the country is recovering from the trauma of its bailout in March 2013. Irish car sales are up 20.3% year on year, while they are up 30% in Portugal. But they dipped by 2.8% in Finland, where the economy has been struggling this year. The slow but steady recovery in Europe\u2019s car industry continues, with sales rising for the 14th month running. A total of 1,072,837 new vehicles were registered in the EU in October, 6.5% more than in October 2013, data just released by industry body ACEA shows. \u201cSubstantial growth prevailed in most major markets\u201d, ACEA says. That continues a trend of higher sales dating back to September 2013, defying the wider slowdown in the European economy. That is also the most cars sold in any October since 2009, before the eurozone debt crisis began. ACEA reports that car sales in Spain were 26.1% higher than a year ago, suggesting a popular scrappage scheme is still driving demand. Sales in the UK were 14.2% higher in October, while they were 9.2% higher in Italy and 3.7% higher in Germany. But the French market languished behind, with sales 3.8% lower than a year ago. That underlines the impact of its rising unemployment and weak consumer confidence. Since the start of 2014, 10,645,907 new cars have been registered in Europe, 6.1% more than in 2013. But again, France lagged behind. As ACEA explains, this year\u2019s growth was: mainly led by the significant growth recorded in Spain (+18.1%) and in the UK (+9.5%). Likewise Italian (+4.2%), German (+3%) and French (+1.4%) markets expanded. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Quite a lot coming up this morning. The latest UK inflation data, due at 9.30am GMT, will show if the slowdown in rising prices continues in October, with knock-on effects on real wages and interest rate rises. UK house price data, released at the same time, may indicate the housing market slowed again last month too. We also get a new snapshot of German investor confidence at 10am GMT, with the ZEW index. Is the Ukraine crisis, and Germany\u2019s weakening economy, still causing alarm? Investors around the globe will be watching Japan, after it fell into recession yesterday. Stocks in Toyko have clawed back some of yesterday\u2019s losses, on speculation that the impending sales tax hike \u2013 blamed for pushing down growth \u2013 will be delayed. Prime minister Shinzo Abe is expected to give a statement this morning, and could announce a general election. There are also plenty of UK companies reporting results this morning, including budget airline EastJet and property developer British Land (owner of the Cheesegrater skyscraper, which shed two bolts earlier this month). I\u2019ll be tracking all the events though the day....",

Papantoniou\u2019s wife, Stavroula Kourakou, was also handed a four -year sentence after her name was similarly found on a list of wealthy Greeks (many suspected tax evaders) with holdings at the HSBC bank in Geneva. Commonly known as the Lagarde list, the tally of names has been the source of embarrassment and scandal for leading members of Greece\u2019s political and business elite.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The 65-year-old politician was told that the sentences would be suspended until the case is heard by a higher court. Greek politicians, by law, have to make public assets and annual earnings.</p> <p>Corruption is widely seen as a root cause of many of the country\u2019s financial foes and in the five years since Athens\u2019 near-economic collapse. </p> <p>Greeks have loudly complained that almost none of their corrupt political class have been punished for the depredations that pushed Greece to the brink.</p> <p>In the case of Papantoniou there may be worse to come.

      "bodyText": "Inflation edged higher last month, pushed up by more expensive computer game releases in the run-up to Christmas, but overall price pressures remained low. Economists said inflation could still fall back in coming months and that it was pretty certain interest rates would remain at their record low until late next year. Official figures showed inflation ticked up to 1.3% in October, from 1.2% in September, on the consumer prices index (CPI) measure, as forecast in a Reuters poll. \u201cWe expect further falls in petrol prices, along with utility companies keeping prices on hold, to drag inflation down to 1.0% by December,\u201d said Robert Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg bank. \u201cLow inflation, meagre wage gains and a dovish central bank mean rate hikes are off the table for the next six months.\u201d Falling world oil prices brought down the cost of fuel between September and October but the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it was smaller than a dip in fuel prices at the same time last year so the effect contributed to the slight rise in annual inflation.. The other main upward effect came from computer games \u201cwhere a number of new titles have been released in the run-up to Christmas replacing cheaper titles in the computer games charts.\u201d The rise follows the arrival on the market of next generation consoles whose games are significantly more expensive than those for older consoles. New releases in October included Alien: Isolation (pictured), motorsport game Forza Horizon 2 and Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, loosely based on Lord of the Rings. Air fares also contributed to the rise with a smaller fall in prices than a year ago. There was also some upward pressure from UK and EU student tuition fees. The retail prices index, a broader inflation measure including housing costs and used to calculate some pay deals, was up 2.3% on a year earlier, unchanged from September\u2019s rate. There were further signs that the squeeze on household budgets may be easing as the ONS said the price of food and non-alcoholic drinks fell again amid a supermarket price war. The run of falling food and drink prices is now the longest since 2000. Inflation also looks set to remain below or close to the pace of pay rises, bringing the prospect of some real wage growth after years of decline. Figures last week showed pay growth for July to September was 1.3%, excluding bonuses. Pay figures covering October are not due for another month but may show a slight uptick to match or beat that latest inflation number, thanks to a rise in the minimum wage as well as falling unemployment. The Treasury welcomed the inflation figures. \u201cThe government\u2019s long term economic plan is working, with inflation falling by three quarters since its peak in September 2011 and pay cheques rising,\u201d said a spokesman. But Labour countered that people were still under pressure after years of pay lagging behind price rises. Catherine McKinnell, Labour\u2019s shadow Treasury minister said: \u201cWhile ministers deny there\u2019s a cost-of-living crisis these figures show an unexpected rise in inflation.\u201d The New Economic Foundation thinktank said the poorest were being hit hardest by rising prices. Using the official figures to gauge the price rises different groups are likely to be feeling, it calculated a 1.44% inflation rate for the poorest 10%. The rate was 1.31% for the poorest 30% and for the richest third it was 1.27%. \u201cThis happens because poorer households and individuals must spend more of their income on essentials. And poorer households have not benefited from falling transport costs... as much as those further up the scale,\u201d the thinktank said in its Real Britain Index report. \u201cTaken together, these figures suggest that real incomes are still falling for at least the poorest third of our society \u2013 but that things may have turned a corner towards the top.\u201d",

And poorer households have not benefited from falling transport costs... as much as those further up the scale,\u201d the thinktank said in its <a href=\"http://www.realbritainindex.org/\" title=\"\">Real Britain Index</a> report.</p> <p>\u201cTaken together, these figures suggest that real incomes are still falling for at least the poorest third of our society \u2013 but that things may have turned a corner towards the top.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"523b5a1917a8a9095582eec54212c3d85832ca0f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/18/1416316063085/010cd207-951c-4d57-83e6-83fc41723ebe-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Video game Alien: Isolation pays interactive tribute to filmmaker Ridley Scott's seminal 1979 sci-fi horror movie\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Video game Alien: Isolation pays interactive tribute to filmmaker Ridley Scott\u2019s seminal 1979 sci-fi horror movie.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The threat of a mansion tax after next May\u2019s general election has put off potential buyers of \u00a32m-plus homes in London, Savills has said. The uncertainty surrounding the 7 May vote will continue to hold back the very top end of the capital\u2019s luxury property market in the next few months, the upmarket estate agent added. Would-be buyers are sitting on their hands because Labour has pledged to introduce a new levy on owners of homes worth more than \u00a32m to raise \u00a31.2bn for the NHS if it wins the election. Mayfair-based Savills said: \u201cThe general election and the potential implementation of a \u2018mansion tax\u2019 thereafter has had the expected subduing effect on buyers, albeit that we have seen registered buyers per listed property rise since the low point around the Scottish independence vote.\u201d Experts reckon at least 80% of homes that would be subject to the tax are in London and the south-east. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has said there would be four levels of mansion tax, with the lowest band for homes worth between \u00a32m and \u00a35m. At the top end, billionaires splashing out \u00a3100m or more for a proper mansion \u2013 not just a Mayfair pad \u2013 will pay the most. The middle part of the London market \u2013 homes worth between \u00a31m and \u00a32m \u2013 remains robust, Savills said. Across the rest of the UK, sales are rising, particularly of homes worth less than \u00a32m. With the ultra-luxury property market slowing, the firm has been focusing on what boss Jeremy Helsby calls a \u201cmid-market brand,\u201d selling homes between \u00a31m and \u00a32m in areas such as East Sheen, Victoria and Battersea in south-west London. The bottom end of the capital\u2019s housing market \u2013 homes worth \u00a3500,000 or less \u2013 has been hit by tighter mortgage rules. Savills does not operate in this area but its rival Foxtons, which does, said last month that 2014 profits would fall because of a sharp slowdown in the capital\u2019s property market. Property developer British Land also said on Tuesday that \u201coverall volumes and price growth have slowed\u201d in the London residential market. However, the \u201csuper-prime segment has been more resilient\u201d, it added. It pointed to Clarges Mayfair where it has sold 18 apartments overlooking Green Park and Buckingham Palace for a total \u00a3210m, equating to an average \u00a34,750 per sq ft \u2013 a new record for Mayfair. Savills is still confident it can meet its forecasts for this year. Sales in Hong Kong and Singapore have also been hit by levies on expensive homes imposed to cool booming markets, but other Asian markets such as Japan and Australia are performing well and its recent US acquisition Studly has beaten expectations. Analysts at Numis said: \u201cSavills\u2019 update shows that whilst some of its core markets remain challenging, it is on target for a strong year with 20% profit growth forecast.\u201d They reckon Savills will make pretax profits of \u00a390m this year and \u00a3105m in 2015.",

      "body": "<p>The threat of a mansion tax after next May\u2019s general election has put off potential buyers of \u00a32m-plus homes in London, Savills has said.</p> <p>The uncertainty surrounding the 7 May vote will continue to hold back the very top end of the capital\u2019s luxury property market in the next few months, the upmarket estate agent added. Would-be buyers are sitting on their hands because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/26/mansion-tax-rich-homeowners-labour-party\" title=\"\">Labour has pledged to introduce a new levy on owners of homes worth more than \u00a32m</a> to raise \u00a31.2bn for the NHS if it wins the election.</p> <p>Mayfair-based Savills said: \u201cThe general election and the potential implementation of a \u2018mansion tax\u2019 thereafter has had the expected subduing effect on buyers, albeit that we have seen registered buyers per listed property rise since the low point around the Scottish independence vote.\u201d</p> <p>Experts reckon at least 80% of homes that would be subject to the tax are in London and the south-east. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has said there would be four levels of mansion tax, with the lowest band for homes worth between \u00a32m and \u00a35m. At the top end, billionaires splashing out \u00a3100m or more for a proper mansion \u2013 not just a Mayfair pad \u2013 will pay the most.</p> <p>The middle part of the London market \u2013 homes worth between \u00a31m and \u00a32m \u2013 remains robust, Savills said. Across the rest of the UK, sales are rising, particularly of homes worth less than \u00a32m. With the ultra-luxury property market slowing, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/aug/07/london-property-price-boom-slowing-savills\" title=\"\">firm has been focusing on what boss Jeremy Helsby calls a \u201cmid-market brand</a>,\u201d selling homes between \u00a31m and \u00a32m in areas such as East Sheen, Victoria and Battersea in south-west London.</p> <p>The bottom end of the capital\u2019s housing market \u2013 homes worth \u00a3500,000 or less \u2013 has been hit by tighter mortgage rules. Savills does not operate in this area but its rival Foxtons, which does, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/23/foxtons-shares-plunge-london-property-market-slows\" title=\"\">said last month that 2014 profits would fall</a> because of a sharp slowdown in the capital\u2019s property market.</p> <p>Property developer British Land also said on Tuesday that \u201coverall volumes and price growth have slowed\u201d in the London residential market. However, the \u201csuper-prime segment has been more resilient\u201d, it added. It pointed to <a href=\"http://www.britishland.com/media/news/2014/22-09-2014.aspx\" title=\"\">Clarges Mayfair where it has sold 18 apartments overlooking Green Park and Buckingham Palace for a total \u00a3210m</a>, equating to an average \u00a34,750 per sq ft \u2013 a new record for Mayfair.</p> <p>Savills is still confident it can meet its forecasts for this year. Sales in Hong Kong and Singapore have also been hit by levies on expensive homes imposed to cool booming markets, but other Asian markets such as Japan and Australia are performing well and its recent US acquisition Studly has beaten expectations.</p> <p>Analysts at Numis said: \u201cSavills\u2019 update shows that whilst some of its core markets remain challenging, it is on target for a strong year with 20% profit growth forecast.\u201d They reckon Savills will make pretax profits of \u00a390m this year and \u00a3105m in 2015.</p>",

      "bodyText": "UK house prices slipped back from their record highs in September, according to official figures that add to evidence the property market is coming off the boil. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the annual rise in prices in September was the fastest for more than seven years, with London again leading the way. But looking at the average price of a house rather than year-on-year rises, the market appeared to cool. The ONS said the average UK house price in September was \u00a3273,000, down from a record \u00a3274,000 in August. \u201cThis month has seen house prices in a number of regions fall back from the record levels witnessed in August 2014. Only house prices in the East of England remain at record levels,\u201d the ONS said in its latest house price report. Compared with a year earlier, prices in September were up 12.1%, the highest house price inflation since before the financial crisis in July 2007. The ONS said the fastest growth was again in London where prices rose 18.8%, down from 19.6% in August. \u201cWhile this is still a very strong year-on-year increase, there is now compelling evidence that the capital\u2019s housing market is cooling,\u201d said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. Commenting on the UK-wide outlook, he added: \u201cWith housing market activity clearly off its early-2014 highs, we suspect house prices will generally rise at a more sedate rate over the coming months. Specifically, we expect house prices to rise by around 5% in 2015 after a likely modest overall increase in the fourth quarter of 2014.\u201d The latest house price figures from Britain\u2019s biggest building society, Nationwide, added to evidence of a slowdown with the annual rate of house price growth down to 9% in October from 9.4% in September. The number of mortgages approved for people to buy homes, seen as an indicator of demand and where prices are headed, has also been falling and hit a 14-month low in September, according to Bank of England figures. Evictions: Shelter reports more people seeking advice The shortage of affordable homes has driven a surge in people on the brink of homelessness contacting Shelter. The charity said it had almost 1,000 inquiries a week over the past year from people at serious risk of losing their home. The year\u2019s 51,000 calls mark a 4% rise on 2013, but a 28% jump from 2012. Shelter expects calls to increase as housing costs continue to do so. Government figures last week showed the number of tenant households in England and Wales evicted from their homes hit record levels in the third quarter of the year, with cuts to social security among factors leading to more than 100 evictions a day.",

We see strong upside to the shares, which currently trade on a PE of 9 times to December 2015 and free cash flow yield of just under 13%. But media group Informa has fallen 31.9p to 472.6p as it said it would raise \u00a3275m through a share placing as part of a plan to buy US trade show operator Hanley Wood Exhibitions for \u00a3237m in cash.",

Terry, finance director Laurence Moorse and non-executive director Steve Scott are all stepping down, the company has confirmed. They have all left the board immediately but Terry will stay on as a consultant while Moorse will remain at the company for up to a year to \u201ceffect an orderly handover.\u201d Former Investec banker David Currie becomes temporary chairman. The moves come a day after the company said joint broker Canaccord Genuity had quit, after giving notice in October. Terry and the other two directors had announced they were buying shares in the company following its share price slump, using loans secured on their existing stakes. But it later emerged they had actually entered a sale and repurchase agreement with US group Equities First Holdings, effectively selling shares to raise cash to buy more. When the company was forced to issue a clarifying statement, it became clear that Terry had sold more shares than he had bought. Investors who had seen the share price slump were furious at the seeming disparity between the two statements. Following news of his departure Terry - the driving force behind the business - has attempted to explain the situation: I entered into the share transactions announced on 5 November 2014, with the best of intentions for the company and all shareholders and it would have been my intention to acquire more shares were it not for the restrictions due to the discussions leading to this announcement. I am clearly disappointed and sorry that events turned out as they did. In view of the share price performance of the last few days, it is likely that a margin call will be made in relation to the share transactions and, at the current share price, I would expect to relinquish my rights to acquire 8,850,000 shares under the EFH sale and repurchase agreement, rather than satisfying the margin call as this would now no longer make economic sense. This will draw a line under this agreement and I have no intention of making further use of this agreement or its like again. The news has seen Quindell shares suffer another volatile day, falling as low as 47p but currently 4% higher at 57.75p, still close to a three year low. The company was hit hard in April after a negative report from US short seller Gotham City, which wiped some \u00a3900m off the company\u2019s value. Although Quindell refuted the Gotham City allegations and claimed a libel victory over the matter, the share price never recovered.

    "webTitle": "EasyJet reports record \u00a3581m profit", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "EasyJet has announced record profits for a fourth successive year as the company continued to bolster its position as Europe\u2019s second-largest budget airline. It reported a rise in profits of 22% to \u00a3581m for the year ending 30 September, as revenues climbed by 6% to \u00a34.5bn. Passenger numbers were up 6% to 64.8 million, with planes flying more than 90% full. Shareholders, including easyJet\u2019s founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, will share a \u00a3180m windfall, after the airline raised its ordinary dividend by more than a third to 45.4p per share. Despite the record profits, growth has slowed since last year and the airline\u2019s share price dropped 1% to \u00a315.30 in early trading. The airline faces more competition from a rejuvenated Ryanair, Europe\u2019s biggest no-frills carrier, which has benefited from a policy of being nice to customers and imitating easyJet with allocated seating and a push to attract business customers. Carolyn McCall, easyJet\u2019s chief executive, said the airline would be rolling out further incentives for the most frequent flyers after the successful trial of a loyalty scheme with 15,000 passengers in France, the UK and Switzerland. The free, invitation-only reward scheme for passengers flying several times a month includes greater flexibility on bookings, price guarantees if a competitor should undercut easyjet\u2019s fare and a dedicated phone number. McCall has been in charge at easyJet for five years and dismissed rumours that she was planning to leave. \u201cI love working at easyJet. We have a really fantastic team \u2026 and there is lots more we can do,\u201d she said. The airline expects customer numbers to continue to grow and reported that advance bookings for the first half of next year were already slightly ahead of the same period in 2014. It also said it faced increasing costs per seat, reflecting higher staff costs from opening new airport bases and maintaining its ageing fleet, although it will gain from falling oil prices. It expects its fuel bill for the first half of the financial year to be between \u00a312 and \u00a322m less than last year. EasyJet is the dominant airline at Gatwick airport, where it has negotiated a long-term deal, but McCall said it was concerning that the recent Airports Commission evaluation of Gatwick\u2019s second runway plan had indicated landing charges would need to rise substantially to pay for it, from the current level of around \u00a39 per passenger to as much as \u00a323, against the airport\u2019s own reckoning of \u00a315. She said: \u201c[Howard] Davies [the commission\u2019s chair] has said Gatwick has underestimated dramatically. It is obviously concerning. When you think our average fare is \u00a360 and we make \u00a38 profit per seat, \u00a323 is a huge amount of money.\u201d She said easyJet was in discussions with both Gatwick and Heathrow, its rival for the commission\u2019s recommendation for a new runway, and added: \u201cThis whole issue of capacity should be about where the demand is. Airlines have to want to go into that airport, and the congestion we have is predominantly around the Heathrow hub. Passengers need to really value what this infrastructure brings, and if they don\u2019t see any benefit it\u2019s going to struggle.\u201d She said a new runway risked emulating unpopular toll roads. \u201cIt will be years and years before [passengers] see any positive effect.\u201d She said easyJet would publish analysis when it had concluded discussions with the airports and its own number-crunching. \u201cIt\u2019s a long-term bet, what is best for easyJet, Heathrow or Gatwick.\u201d The difference in landing charges has previously deterred easyJet from attempting to enter Heathrow, but McCall added: \u201dWe work out of hub airports all across Europe where the yield is right. There\u2019s no reason we wouldn\u2019t do it in London.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>David Cameron\u2019s article (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/16/red-lights-global-economy-david-cameron\" title=\"\">Red lights are flashing on the world economy</a>, 17 November) starts: \u201cSix years on from the financial crash that brought the world to its knees \u2026 \u201d I don\u2019t normally welcome people of Cameron\u2019s persuasion writing for the Guardian but, if it has finally persuaded him that the Labour government wasn\u2019t to blame for the crash, perhaps readers can look forward to articles indicating Damascene conversions from George Osborne, Danny Alexander et al, who rarely miss an opportunity to prattle on about the \u201cmess that Labour left us\u201d.<br><strong>Ken Vines</strong><br><em>Yelverton, Devon </em></p> <p>\u2022 So David Cameron is warning about the world economy. One hopes he and Osborne will not use this as an excuse for insufficient progress on paying down the deficit despite all the suffering their austerity measures have caused. Just as the Brown government faced financial meltdown, Cameron\u2019s government may now face events beyond its control: they expected Labour to apologise for events not of its making so I am hopeful the Conservatives will be apologising for continued problems. I\u2019m also hoping that they may learn from Labour that one does not just talk about being all in this together, but actually takes action to reduce inequality.</p> <p>I am not a Labour supporter but have been amazed at how the party has been prepared to let the Conservatives blame it for the economic crisis, which was international and which it handled better than most other governments. If there was any blame specific to the UK it goes back to Margaret Thatcher and her deregulation of the banks and other financial institutions.<br><strong>Eunice Hinds</strong><br><em>Bath</em></p> <p>\u2022 At last, Dave Cameron has admitted that austerity is a failure. The austerity measures implemented across Europe and the globe have failed. The only economies that are succeeding globally are those that did not implement the \u201cslash and burn\u201d policies that we now see having a devastating effect. Austerity measures have devastated society and communities across the UK. Now a report by the London School of Economics and the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex has shown <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/15/coalition-helped-rich-hitting-poor-george-osborne\" title=\"\">the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer</a>. Austerity is not working, we need a change.<br><strong>Duncan Anderson</strong><br><em>Immingham, Lincolnshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 David Cameron wants to put rocket boosters behind the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). In doing this he is following the advice of the then governor of the Deutsche Bundesbank, who in 1998 praised governments for preferring \u201cthe permanent plebiscite of the global markets\u201d to \u201cthe plebiscite of the ballot box\u201d. We seem to be leaving democracy floundering. Karl Popper in The Open Society and Its Enemies wrote: \u201cIf we wish freedom to be safeguarded, then we must demand that the policy of unlimited economic freedom be replaced by the planned economic intervention of the state. We must demand that unrestrained capitalism give way to economic interventionism.\u201d Perhaps the rocket boosters should be placed behind Cameron.<br><strong>Alec Murdoch</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 When David Cameron warns of a second global crash, what he really means is that we haven\u2019t fixed the causes of the first one. The banks are still playing double or quits with international financial flows. The wealthy are still removing vast sums from national economies and from consumer markets. Bleeding chunks of the general population have no viable work environment. Consumption is still dependent on low-wage, outsourced exploitation.

      "bodyText": "David Cameron\u2019s article (Red lights are flashing on the world economy, 17 November) starts: \u201cSix years on from the financial crash that brought the world to its knees \u2026 \u201d I don\u2019t normally welcome people of Cameron\u2019s persuasion writing for the Guardian but, if it has finally persuaded him that the Labour government wasn\u2019t to blame for the crash, perhaps readers can look forward to articles indicating Damascene conversions from George Osborne, Danny Alexander et al, who rarely miss an opportunity to prattle on about the \u201cmess that Labour left us\u201d. Ken Vines Yelverton, Devon \u2022 So David Cameron is warning about the world economy. One hopes he and Osborne will not use this as an excuse for insufficient progress on paying down the deficit despite all the suffering their austerity measures have caused. Just as the Brown government faced financial meltdown, Cameron\u2019s government may now face events beyond its control: they expected Labour to apologise for events not of its making so I am hopeful the Conservatives will be apologising for continued problems. I\u2019m also hoping that they may learn from Labour that one does not just talk about being all in this together, but actually takes action to reduce inequality. I am not a Labour supporter but have been amazed at how the party has been prepared to let the Conservatives blame it for the economic crisis, which was international and which it handled better than most other governments. If there was any blame specific to the UK it goes back to Margaret Thatcher and her deregulation of the banks and other financial institutions. Eunice Hinds Bath \u2022 At last, Dave Cameron has admitted that austerity is a failure. The austerity measures implemented across Europe and the globe have failed. The only economies that are succeeding globally are those that did not implement the \u201cslash and burn\u201d policies that we now see having a devastating effect. Austerity measures have devastated society and communities across the UK. Now a report by the London School of Economics and the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex has shown the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer. Austerity is not working, we need a change. Duncan Anderson Immingham, Lincolnshire \u2022 David Cameron wants to put rocket boosters behind the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). In doing this he is following the advice of the then governor of the Deutsche Bundesbank, who in 1998 praised governments for preferring \u201cthe permanent plebiscite of the global markets\u201d to \u201cthe plebiscite of the ballot box\u201d. We seem to be leaving democracy floundering. Karl Popper in The Open Society and Its Enemies wrote: \u201cIf we wish freedom to be safeguarded, then we must demand that the policy of unlimited economic freedom be replaced by the planned economic intervention of the state. We must demand that unrestrained capitalism give way to economic interventionism.\u201d Perhaps the rocket boosters should be placed behind Cameron. Alec Murdoch Edinburgh \u2022 When David Cameron warns of a second global crash, what he really means is that we haven\u2019t fixed the causes of the first one. The banks are still playing double or quits with international financial flows. The wealthy are still removing vast sums from national economies and from consumer markets. Bleeding chunks of the general population have no viable work environment. Consumption is still dependent on low-wage, outsourced exploitation. TTIP demonstrates Cameron is as gullible as was Gordon Brown. Our political leaders sit around larger and larger tables, making promises they have no idea how to keep. In a era of mass communication, established politicians get so much information every day they cannot get their heads around any of it: so ideology becomes a life raft. Technology is making \u201cmonkey see, monkey do\u201d of all of us. Martin London Henllan, Denbighshire \u2022 It\u2019s a bit rich that Cameron is talking about red lights flashing over the economy when world experts have been warning for at least the last four years that the policies of his chancellor and those of the same political persuasion as our PM throughout the world would lead to just this. Peter Collins Bromley, Kent \u2022 The warning lights that have flashed at David Cameron suggest he is playing Hilaire Belloc\u2019s 1907 strategy from Cautionary Tales for Children: \u201cAlways keep a hold of Nurse, / For fear of meeting something worse\u201d. It worked for Margaret Thatcher but is the present PM such good casting? Iain Mackintosh London \u2022 No wonder the red lights are flashing. If we go into economic meltdown, how will all those hedge funds be able to finance his election campaign? Brian Morris Wakefield",

The quarterly increase of 0.6% was the second lowest of all-time, only beaten by the 0.4% rise that occurred in the midst of the GFC in September 2009. </p> <p>And, of course, there was silence from Senator Abetz. When the treasurer, Joe Hockey, was asked about wages growth on <a href=\"http://jbh.ministers.treasury.gov.au/transcript/117-2014/\">ABC radio</a>, the only concern was the impact on the budget. Lower wages means less income tax revenue and the <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/2014-15/content/bp1/html/bp1_bst2-01.htm\">2014-15 budget</a> estimated wages growth of 3% for 2014-15. </p> <p>Our current industrial relations framework was largely put in place by Paul Keating\u2019s ALP government.

In a time of weaker employment and weaker inflation, wages, rather than outpacing the economy, are reacting to reduced demand and excess of supply by slowing. It is essentially a successful \u201ccapital friendly\u201d system instituted by the labour friendly side of government. Yet there is no thanks for it, only complaints that it doesn\u2019t go far enough. And ironically, given the lower wages will hurt Joe Hockey\u2019s bottom line, right now he might actually be wishing the IR system was not operating so efficiently.",
