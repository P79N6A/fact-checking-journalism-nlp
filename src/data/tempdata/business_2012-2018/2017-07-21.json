      "bodyText": "Boots has said it is \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for the way it responded to a campaign calling for it to cut the price of emergency contraception and said it is looking for cheaper alternatives. The announcement, late on Friday night, came after news that the women\u2019s parliamentary Labour party (PLP) had written to the store\u2019s chief pharmacist to express \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the company\u2019s refusal to reduce the price of emergency contraception, and as calls for a boycott continue to grow. Boots had said on Thursday it would not lower the cost of the morning-after pill despite a campaign from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), a leading provider of abortion care, with its chief pharmacist, Marc Donovan, stating that the company did not want to be accused of \u201cincentivising inappropriate use\u201d. Campaigners said the statement was insulting and sexist, and on Friday Anna Soubry, the Conservative MP for Broxtowe \u2013 where the Boots headquarters is located \u2013 said she was also writing a letter to the company asking it to make clear its reasons for not reducing prices. The Labour letter, signed by the chair of the women\u2019s parliamentary Labour party, Jess Phillips, as well as a number of prominent MPs including Harriet Harman, Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves, said: \u201cBoots is the largest high-street pharmacy in the UK, and 90% of the population lives within 10 minutes of one of their shops. \u201cIt is therefore completely unacceptable that British women have been paying up to \u00a330 for a pill that costs a fraction of that to produce. The high cost of emergency contraception at Boots is preventing women from accessing it when needed.\u201d Both Tesco and Superdrug halved the price of their emergency contraceptive following the BPAS campaign, but Boots continues to charge \u00a328.25 for Levonelle emergency contraceptive (the leading brand) and \u00a326.75 for its own generic version. Tesco now charges \u00a313.50 for Levonelle and Superdrug \u00a313.49 for a generic version. In France, the tablet costs \u00a35.50. \u201cBoots\u2019 justification infantalises women and places a moral judgment on them,\u201d Phillips told the Guardian. \u201cTheir pricing is clearly for commercial gain as Tesco and Superdrug have addressed this issue with sensible pricing. \u201cWomen do not need to be disincentivised by Boots to make personal choices about their bodies. We women go to Boots for our products, not moral guidance. Public opinion is not on their side so if they are worried about complaints they are listening to the wrong voices and customers should vote with their feet.\u201d Phillips said she did not believe Boots \u201cwould ever pass moral judgment on men\u2019s contraceptives\u201d. \u201cDo they give a lecture on consent with all condom purchases?\u201d she said. In a recent YouGov survey, the median cost suggested by women for emergency contraception was \u00a38, and the median cost suggested by men was \u00a35. Almost a third of women and a quarter of men, the Labour letter added, believed emergency contraception should be free of charge. \u201cConcern about adverse criticism from pressure groups seems a very strange reason not to do the right thing,\u201d Soubry said. \u201cThis is perfectly proper and lawful treatment. I\u2019ve always found Boots to be an excellent business company, they employ a lot of people in my constituency, they are a valued employer and they\u2019ve always had a strong desire to do the right thing throughout the whole of their long history. So not doing this doesn\u2019t sit with the way Boots normally operates and the high standing it has locally. \u201cI would hope that they would be true to their tradition of doing the right thing, and doing the right thing is not giving in to pressure from the noisiest quarters. I am asking them for what reasons they are not reducing the cost of the morning-after pill given that other companies have reduced the charge. I urge them to reduce prices in accordance with their competitors.\u201d The MP Stella Creasy tweeted that Boots\u2019 decision \u201ccontravenes consumer rights act given adds disproportionate charge which is not advertised\u201d, while the writer Marian Keyes was among those condemning the company on Twitter, saying she would be \u201cwithdrawing my (considerable) custom\u201d. Announcing the retailer\u2019s change of stance on Friday night, a spokesman for Boots said: \u201cPharmacy and care for customers are at the heart of everything we do, and as such we are truly sorry that our poor choice of words in describing our position on emergency hormonal contraception has caused offence and misunderstanding, and we sincerely apologise.\u201d In his original response to campaigners, Donovan said that Boots considered the issue very carefully but pointed out that the morning-after pill is already available for free in community pharmacies and NHS services. Sophie Walker, leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, which had joined forces with BPAS to call for a boycott using the hashtag #justsaynon, said that the morning-after pill can be difficult to access for free on the NHS, with appointments at GP surgeries or family planning clinics hard to obtain at short notice. \u201cMany women will need to buy these pills over the counter, and it is irresponsible and exploitative for retailers to charge over the odds for them ... Boots\u2019 approach to this concern is indicative of a society that prioritises profit over women\u2019s health and wellbeing,\u201d Walker said. Ann Clwyd MP, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on sexual and reproductive health, said: \u201cBoots need to wise up. The reality is there are too many unwanted births. How come the tablets are available in France for \u00a35.50? A case of Boots\u2019 profit priority, I would say.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British holidaymakers heading to Europe for this weekend\u2019s big getaway are being offered what may be the worst ever foreign exchange rates at British airports \u2013 in one case, just 88 euro cents for every pound they hand over. The 88 euro cents offered at Cardiff airport followed a difficult week for the pound on the foreign exchange markets, where sterling fell to its lowest level for eight months to \u20ac1.11. Travellers flying out of Gatwick, Luton and Birmingham on Friday were all being offered less than a euro for each pound, unless they had pre-booked their currency. As thousands of parents who had been waiting for the start of the school holidays spent yesterday packing suitcases, the pound completed a terrible week falling to its lowest level for eight months \u2013 to \u20ac1.11. It means cycling fans using their credit cards at the denouement of the Tour de France in Paris on Sunday will get an exchange rate of around \u20ac1.08 once the credit card firm has added its commission. But it also allowed the airport foreign currency providers to slash rates \u2013 on what was set to the busiest day ever at British airports. The Forexchange at Cardiff airport on Friday cut its walk-up rate to the point that a pound would buy just 88 euro cents. Experts said that was possibly the worst euro exchange rate ever seen at any UK airport \u2013 traditionally the most expensive places to buy foreign currency. The Travelex foreign exchange booths at Heathrow, Manchester and Glasgow were offering almost exactly \u20ac1 to the pound. The foreign exchange industry has blamed higher staff and property costs at airports for the poor exchange rates. Ian Strafford-Taylor, chief executive of the online currency firm FairFX, said political and economic uncertainty since the vote for Brexit had weakened the pound, and British holidaymakers are now paying the price. \u201cTime and time again, we have seen how the pound has been subject to volatility since the Brexit referendum and how some currency providers look to be taking advantage of it. Our analysis of airport rates today shows that consumers are routinely being offered as low as 0.96 euros to the pound, well below parity. It couldn\u2019t come at a worse time just as the nation heads off for the great summer holiday getaway.\u201d He said the pound\u2019s decline since the referendum means that European hotels, meals out and pedalo hires are set to cost British holidaymakers 7% more than they did this time last year, and 21% more than in the summer of 2015. This is before any local price increases are included. In the first week of the school summer holidays in 2015, Britons travelling to Europe received more than \u20ac1.41 for each pound. Sterling\u2019s latest plunge against the euro has been blamed on Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, who pushed the euro higher on the foreign exchange markets after saying that his governing council could soon start slowing the amount of money the bank will inject into the European economy. While the euro\u2019s rally makes travelling to the UK cheaper for visitors using the euro, it makes it more expensive for British travellers. Economists at Berenberg said: \u201cSterling depreciated in the run-up to the Brexit vote, despite the continued economic expansion. When the UK voted for Brexit on 23 June last year, sterling took another big leg down.\u201d Since then sterling has recovered some ground. The fluctuations mean that anyone who reserved a hotel room as recently as May will pay 6% more this week than if they had paid upfront. The pound has fallen 2% this week alone, and only remains above last November\u2019s low of \u20ac1.10. According to Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at financial firm MUFG, the pound over the last five trading days \u201cis by some distance the worst performing\u201d of the 10 most heavily traded currencies in the world.",

      "bodyText": "Several hundred banks and companies have contacted German authorities about expanding in Frankfurt, as the city vies to become the EU\u2019s principal financial centre after Brexit. Lucia Puttrich, Europe minister in the government of the state of Hesse, told the Guardian she had been in talks with several banks about expanding their presence in Frankfurt or the Rhine-Main area. US investment bank Morgan Stanley is the latest to choose the German city as the site of its post-Brexit European hub, it emerged this week, following official announcements from seven other banks, including Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered, that they will expand operations in Frankfurt. Other institutions beefing up their Frankfurt offices include Daiwa, Sumitomo Mitsui and Nomura of Japan, VTB of Russia and Woori Bank of South Korea. \u201cThe movement will not be initiated immediately but it will be step by step,\u201d Puttrich said. \u201c London will remain an important financial centre ... [but] there will be a transfer from those who need to have an office in the European Union, because London will not be in the internal market. \u201cPeople talk about several thousand [jobs coming to Frankfurt], but it is difficult to put a figure on it.\u201d The state of Hesse has had \u201cseveral hundred contacts with institutions in Great Britain and especially London\u201d, a spokesman added, although many of these discussions were at an early stage. Some of these companies may opt for Paris, Dublin, Brussels or Luxembourg; others may not move. Nevertheless, the remarks may ring alarm bells that a banking exodus is gathering pace, following a warning from the City regulator that banks were approaching the point where they must move staff out of London to continue operating smoothly after Brexit. Jobs leaving the City have so far been relatively limited, however, compared with the 751,000 people working in London in banking and related professional services. Frankfurt, home to the European Central Bank and the German Bundesbank, already hosts the biggest European operations of US investment banks outside London. Researchers at the Bruegel thinktank have forecast that Frankfurt will take the biggest share of London\u2019s post-Brexit business in a report that predicted the loss of 30,000 jobs in the City. Frankfurt\u2019s leaders were quick out of the blocks to woo banks. Regional and national politicians met last July, 18 days after the Brexit vote, where they agreed on a campaign to persuade banks to relocate, including a marketing office in London. Frankfurt shed jobs after the financial crisis and regional authorities think the influx of bankers from London may only take the city back to 2007 banking employment levels. Puttrich, who also represents Hesse state interests to the federal government, said Germany was making the best of a bad situation. \u201cNobody wanted Brexit so even if you benefit from strengthening of the financial centre we will still pay a high price.\u201d The disadvantages are \u201cmuch bigger for the British but they will have impacts on the EU as a whole\u201d, she said, referring to the end of British payments to the EU budget and the UK\u2019s \u201cenriching\u201d contribution to EU politics. Puttrich, a member of the ruling CDU party, gave short shrift to the idea the UK could get special help because it might suit German carmakers. Noting that the UK is \u201cnot our strongest commercial partner\u201d she emphasised trade ties with central Europe and Germany\u2019s interest in preserving single market rules. Frankfurt is also vying to host the European Banking Authority once the EU agency leaves its London headquarters after Brexit. The British government fought keenly for the agency and its 150 jobs, created to supervise banks after the financial crash.",

      "bodyText": "The government was forced to borrow more than expected in June after a jump in the UK\u2019s budget deficit to \u00a36.9bn \u2013 almost 50% higher than the same month last year. The sharp rise followed a spike in the cost of financing the UK\u2019s debt, a drop in corporation tax receipts and a larger than forecast contribution to the EU in June. There is growing pressure on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to loosen the public purse strings but some analysts said the figures are likely to toughen his stance on pleas from ministers for extra funds. There was good news for the chancellor after data indicated that the dramatic slowdown in the economy during the first quarter had so far failed to reduce tax receipts. Corporation tax fell by more than 4% compared with June last year but all the main sources of tax receipts \u2013 income tax, national insurance and VAT \u2013 were up more than that predicted by the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The Treasury said the persistent shortfall in the government\u2019s income compared with spending illustrated the need for a \u201ccredible fiscal plan\u201d that allowed ministers to support \u201csound public finances\u201d while \u201cpromoting a stronger economy\u201d. Opposition parties were quick to say that the higher deficit showed that austerity had failed and was delivering weaker public services without strengthening the public finances or the economy. The deficit is already expected to rise from full-year borrowing of \u00a346bn last year to \u00a358bn this year. With a queue of government departments clamouring for inflation-busting rises in their funding before the autumn budget, the early signs are that Hammond will be reluctant to put extra cash on the table. The chancellor is under pressure to relax a pay cap on public sector workers and find extra resources to boost police and healthcare budgets. Some analysts said the bigger-than-expected deficit in June meant the final figure could exceed \u00a360bn before any extra money has been allocated for public services. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, said it was worrying that the deficit was wider than expected in the early part of the financial year when the last third was already scheduled to see a large deterioration in tax receipts. Phil Shaw, an economist at Investec, said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures illustrate the challenges confronting the chancellor to manage the public finances, as he is faced with a double whammy of slowing growth and rising inflation on one side and calls for greater expenditure on the other. \u201cIt is now looking likely that the deficit will rise this year for the first time since 2012-13. There are some idiosyncratic factors here and the OBR\u2019s forecasts already envisage extra borrowing. But there are medium-term challenges as well, not least from the ageing population, as the OBR\u2019s recent Fiscal Risk Report highlighted. \u201cUnless there is a sensible public debate over the UK\u2019s fiscal challenges, the government will face an uphill task in providing a coherent response to deliver sustainable public finances,\u201d he said. But John Hawksworth, PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 chief economist, said the chancellor would still have room for increases in public spending in the budget. \u201cLooking beyond the current financial year, we would expect the decline in the budget deficit to resume if current tax and spending plans are maintained. This should give the chancellor some room for manoeuvre in his autumn budget to ease up on austerity in priority areas like health, social care, policing and housing investment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he will wish to do this in a measured way given the uncertainties around the economic environment as the Brexit process continues and the high initial level of the public debt to GDP ratio.\u201d In the first three months of the financial year, the budget deficit widened by 8.9% compared with the same period in 2016 to \u00a322.8bn, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Spending on debt interest jumped an annual 33% in June to \u00a34.9bn, the highest for any month of June since 2011, reflecting a sharp rise in inflation that has pushed up the cost of index-linked bonds for the government. The deficit was also widened by higher payments to the EU budget, which have shifted from the usual pattern of contributions to skew annual comparisons, and bigger purchases of goods and services by the government. The EU contribution was \u00a3700m higher than in June 2016. The ONS said income tax and capital gains tax revenues increased by an annual 7.1% to \u00a312.7bn but corporation tax revenues fell by 3.2% on the year to \u00a34.8bn.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bank of America has become the latest high-profile City firm to reveal its post-Brexit EU hub, selecting Dublin as the location for some of its activities, amid fresh calls for the UK to clinch a transitional deal before it leaves the 28-nation bloc in 2019. The American bank, which employs 6,500 people in the UK, already has 700 staff in the Irish capital and now looks likely to relocate more employees to Dublin as Brexit approaches. Brian Moynihan, chief executive of Bank of America, was in Dublin for the landmark announcement, which was made after a meeting with taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who is keen to capitalise on the fallout from the City after the vote for Brexit. Varadkar has met a number of bank bosses this month, including Jes Staley of Barclays and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase, the US bank that has bought a new office in Dublin\u2019s docklands area that can house up to 1,000 staff. Bank of America refused to say how many of its UK-based staff would be affected by the decision to use Dublin for its EU legal entities, which was announced just days after hundreds of financial firms had to submit their plans to cope with \u201ca hard Brexit\u201d to the Bank of England. \u201cWe will move roles not only to Dublin but to other EU locations ... While we await further clarity around the Brexit negotiations, we are making all necessary preparations to serve our clients however those discussions conclude,\u201d said Moynihan. In the past week, a number of City firms have publicised their intentions, including US banks Morgan Stanley and Citi, as well as Deutsche Bank of Germany. John Cryan, the Briton who runs Deustche, said it was \u201cfar from clear what a Brexit constitutes\u201d and City figures and regulators have been calling for an agreement on a transition deal by the end of the year if they are to avoid implementing their contingency plans. Richard Gnodde, head of Goldman Sachs\u2019 European operations, told the BBC that there needed to be a transition arrangement before Brexit in March 2019. \u201cIf they [the government] tell me in February 2019 there will be a transition period \u2013 well, I\u2019ve already spent all that money, it\u2019s not much use to me. At that point the transition period doesn\u2019t really help \u2013 so the sooner we know ... that\u2019s obviously helpful to us,\u201d Gnodde said. Earlier this week, Andrew Bailey, chief executive of City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, said financial firms were getting near to the point where they would have to take steps to move staff and other measures to ensure they can continue to operate seamlessly once the UK leaves the EU. Morgan Stanley has picked Frankfurt and could relocate about 200 staff there. Citi will also beef up its presence in the German city to allow its sales and trading activities to continue across the EU should the UK lose the \u201cpassporting rights\u201d that allow firms to conduct business seemlessly across borders. \u201cIt is not yet possible to assess the outcome or timing of the Brexit negotiations, but in certain circumstances we may need to create approximately 150 new roles located in the EU,\u201d said Jim Cowles, who runs Citi\u2019s operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, in an email to staff this week. Cryan told Deutsche Bank\u2019s 98,000 staff in a video message that UK roles will need to move to Frankfurt or new staff hired. Deutsche employs 9,000 staff across the UK, including 7,000 in the City, and in April warned that up to 4,000 roles could move to Frankfurt. Cryan did not put a figure on job numbers in his latest update. Despite setting out their Brexit plans, both Cryan and Cowles said that London would remain an important financial centre after Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our updated news story: That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Tim Wallace of the Daily Telegraph points out that the government did rake in more tax receipts this week, but not enough to keep pace with higher borrowing costs. The Government\u2019s tax haul is on the rise as the economy grows - so far this financial year current tax receipts have come in at \u00a3164.2bn, up 4.7pc on the \u00a3156.8bn raised last year. However, total current spending has risen by 5.6pc to \u00a3176.7bn, so the Government has had to borrow more to plug that widening gap. Higher interest payments on the national debt were a particularly large cost. Financing the debt cost \u00a34.9bn in June alone, a rise of more than \u00a31bn from \u00a33.7bn in the same month of 2016. Andy Bruce and William Schomberg of Reuters say the deficit figures are a \u2018headache\u2019 for chancellor Philip Hammond: Hammond has come under pressure from within the ruling Conservative Party as well as from the opposition Labour Party to loosen his grip on public spending, chiefly by relaxing a cap on pay for public workers. Spending on debt interest jumped an annual 33 percent in June to 4.9 billion pounds, the highest for any month of June since 2011, reflecting a sharp rise in inflation which has pushed up the cost of index-linked bonds for the government. The deficit was also widened by higher payments to the European Union budget and bigger purchases of goods and services by the government. Lucy Meakin of Bloomberg says today\u2019s figures show the risks facing the public finances. The figures may raise fresh questions about whether Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond can limit borrowing to \u00a358bn this year, as forecast by his budget watchdog in March. Hammond is also under pressure to boost wages for millions of public-sector workers and spend more on health and education after the Tories\u2019 catastrophic election performance highlighted the frustration of voters after seven years of austerity. Newsflash: Bank of America has chosen Dublin as its European Union hub, as it prepares for life after Brexit. The decision will allow BoA to continue operating in the EU, once the City of London loses its \u2018passporting rights\u2019. Brian Moynihan, Chairman and CEO of Bank of America, said Dublin was the \u201cnatural\u201d choice, as it currently houses more BoA employees than any other European City (apart from London, of course). And with no clarity on Britain\u2019s final Brexit deal, BoA is pressing on with its plans. Moynihan says: We already have a fully licenced and operational Irish-domiciled bank which, combined with Ireland\u2019s strong commitment to business and economic growth, makes Dublin the natural location to consolidate our legal entities as we transition. We will move roles not only to Dublin but to other EU locations, with the focus on how we can best support our clients in these markets. While we await further clarity around the Brexit negotiations, we are making all necessary preparations to serve our clients however those discussions conclude.\u201d Ireland\u2019s Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, welcomed the announcement, calling it \u201ca strong endorsement of Ireland\u2019s attractiveness as a location for investment\u201d. Bank of America already has 700 staff in Dublin, and has been based in Ireland for almost 50 years. Earlier this week it contributed \u20ac880,000 to a music education program, following a \u20ac700,000 contribution a few years ago. This chart shows how the repayments on Britain\u2019s national debt has risen in line with inflation, as measured by the retail price index. (Not all UK debt is index-linked of course - some is sold with a fixed coupon that doesn\u2019t move in line with inflation) Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable blames last year\u2019s Brexit vote, and the resulting tumble in the pound, for the rising deficit. Cable (who was appointed leader yesterday) argues that those who voted to leave the European Union to free up more money for healthcare have been misled. \u201cThis rise in borrowing is a direct consequence of the dramatic fall in the pound since last year\u2019s Brexit vote. \u201cInstead of the \u00a3350m for the NHS that was promised, people\u2019s living standards are falling and borrowing is going up. \u201cIt shows why we need to offer people an exit from Brexit. \u201cNobody voted last year to become poorer or to increase the amount of their taxes spent on paying down the national debt.\u201d Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has issued a commentary on today\u2019s public finances. It says Britain\u2019s borrowing was forced up by higher debt costs on bonds linked to inflation, delayed payments to the European Union, and changes to the way self-assessment taxes are collected. Here\u2019s the details: Higher debt interest spending, primarily as higher RPI inflation raises accrued interest on index-linked gilts. Debt interest spending is up 24.3 per cent on a year earlier in the first three months of 2017-18, compared with our full-year forecast of 15.3 per cent. Changes to the timing of expenditure transfers to EU institutions within calendar year 2017, which move spending from the end of 2016-17 into 2017-18. Transfers are up by 78 per cent in the first three months of 2017-18 from a year ago, having been down more than 40 per cent in the final two months of 2016-17. This timing effect explains most of the year-to-date increase, while around a fifth of it is attributable to an additional \u00a30.3 billion payment in relation to historical adjustments to the calculations of VAT- and GNI-based contributions. Self-assessment (SA) receipts will be depressed in 2017-18 by the unwinding of the income shifting ahead of the April 2016 dividend tax rise. We expect receipts to fall \u00a33.9 billion on a year earlier, but unlike the two spending factors, which are already evident in the data, this will only affect the public finances in early 2018 when self-assessment payments are due. The big picture from today\u2019s public finances is that the national debt kept rising over the last year, and is heading towards \u00a31.8 trillion. The ONS says: Public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) was \u00a31,753.5 billion at the end of June 2017, equivalent to 87.4% of gross domestic product (GDP), an increase of \u00a3128.5 billion (or 3.6 percentage points as a ratio of GDP) on June 2016. It\u2019s more useful to look at national debt in terms of the size of an economy, rather than as a raw figure. So in GDP terms, Britain\u2019s debt pile is now its largest since the 1960s, when it was paying down the cost of the second world war: Here\u2019s my colleague Phillip Inman\u2019s take on today\u2019s public finances: The UK borrowed more than expected in June, with the country\u2019s budget deficit rising to \u00a36.9bn - almost 50% higher than the same month last year. Higher inflation forced the government to spend more on financing its debt mountain, other factors included lower GDP growth in the first quarter, a fall in corporation tax receipts and a bigger than expected contribution to the EU budget in June . Analysts said the deficit could now exceed forecasts over the rest of the financial year. The Treasury said the persistent shortfall in the government\u2019s income compared with spending illustrated the need for a \u201ccredible fiscal plan\u201d and that allowed ministers to support \u201csound public finances\u201d while \u201cpromoting a stronger economy\u201d. But opposition parties were quick to say that the higher deficit showed austerity had failed and delivered weaker public services without strengthening the public finances or the economy...... More here: Here\u2019s some more details on the public finances, via the Press Association: The ONS said Government spending rose by 8.3% to \u00a359.9bn in June compared with last year, while tax receipts lifted by 4.6% to \u00a354.3bn. The Treasury saw VAT climb by \u00a3400m to \u00a311.4bn over the period, as income tax takings also stepped up by \u00a3800m to $12.7 billion. However, corporation tax dropped by \u00a3200m to \u00a34.8bn last month. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor John McDonnell has laid into the government over today\u2019s public finances. McDonnell argues that chancellor Hammond should raise taxes on large corporations and the rich, to help fund a pay rise for public sector workers. He says: \u201cThese figures reveal the continued failure of Philip Hammond and the Conservatives. \u201cSeven years of Tory cuts have left our economy weaker, with falling wages, yet the deficit has not been eliminated two years after they claimed it would be, and the national debt continues to rise. \u201cThe Chancellor should stop handing out massive tax giveaways to big businesses and the super-rich, and instead give our hard-pressed public sector workers a pay rise, so we can end the travesty in our country of nurses having to rely on food banks. \u201cOnly a Labour government will set out a serious plan for the public finances, with strategic investment underpinned by our fiscal credibility rule, to help build the high wage, high skill economy of the future for the many, not the few.\u201d The rise in borrowing in June means chancellor Philip Hammond has less wriggle room for tax cuts or spending rises in his next budget. Howard Archer of EY Item Club says: \u201cJune\u2019s shortfall highlights the fact that the public finances are still far from healthy. At the same time rising public dissatisfaction with austerity and the public sector pay cap is exerting pressure on the government to recalibrate fiscal policy in November\u2019s Budget. However it currently looks more likely that there will be limited adjustments, rather than radical changes, to the fiscal approach.\u201d The jump in Britain\u2019s borrowing last month shows that the public finances have deteriorated, according to John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist. But he\u2019s hopeful that Britain could still hit its deficit targets, as last year\u2019s borrowings have been revised down. Hawksworth says: \u201cJune saw a modest deterioration in public finances, with borrowing around \u00a32 billion higher than a year earlier. This followed two months in which the deficit was almost identical to the year before. The general pattern is consistent with the OBR\u2019s March forecast that we might see some increase in the budget deficit this financial year, as the economy slows and some one-off favourable factors from last year unwind. \u201cNonetheless, the deficit may still come in below the OBR\u2019s \u00a358 billion forecast for 2017/18, given that the deficit in 2016/17 is now estimated to be \u00a35.5 billion less than the OBR projected in March. So the increases in borrowing we are now seeing are from a lower base. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics fears that the public finances show that UK growth was weak in the last three months (leading to less tax being taken). Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Today\u2019s public finances also show that corporation tax receipts fell by \u00a3200m in June (year-on-year), helping to push the deficit up. VAT, income tax and stamp duty receipts rose, though: The UK government has responded to the public finances, by admitting that Britain\u2019s national debt is too high. A Treasury spokesman says: \u2018Today\u2019s release shows that our national debt, at \u00a365,000 for every household, is still too high and leaves us vulnerable to any future shocks. That is why we have a credible fiscal plan to get debt falling and deliver the sound public finances needed for a stronger economy and higher living standards.\u201d The government\u2019s current plan is to eliminate the deficit by midway through the next decade (around 10 years later than former chancellor George Osborne once promised....) Digging into today\u2019s disappointing public finances, you can see that the spike in inflation has pushed Britain\u2019s borrowing up. That\u2019s because the UK has issued index-linked bonds, whose interest payments are linked to the retail prices index. RPI was 3.5% in June, up from 1.6% a year ago, which has driven up the cost of servicing Britain\u2019s national debt. As this chart shows, Britain\u2019s interest payments jumped by \u00a31.2bn in June, from \u00a33.7bn to \u00a34.9bn. This chart also shows that Britain\u2019s payments to the EU jumped by \u00a3700m in June. The ONS says: In June 2017, the UK paid \u00a31,249 million to the EU budget through GNI and VAT based contributions, which are made net of the UK rebate. This payment consisted of our standard monthly VAT and GNI based contribution of \u00a3991 million, along with a \u00a3258 million payment adjustment covering earlier years, which will be subject to a further UK rebate. The public finances report also shows that Britain is on track to borrow more this financial year than in 2016-17. As you can see, borrowing is already up compared with a year earlier: Breaking! Britain borrowed more than expected to balance the books in June, in a blow to the government\u2019s fiscal plans. The UK\u2019s public sector net borrowing requirement jumped to \u00a36.9bn in June 2017, which is \u00a32bn more than in June 2016. That\u2019s an increase on May\u2019s \u00a36.7bn. City economists had expected the monthly deficit would drop to \u00a34.7bn, so this suggests that the public finance are in a worse state than hoped. These figures show that Britain has borrowed \u00a322.8bn since the start of the financial year in April, \u00a31.9bn more than in the same period in the previous financial year. More to follow... Analysts at French bank BNP Paribas fear that the strong euro will hit exports, as well as keeping a lid on inflation: (that\u2019s a reference to Mario Draghi\u2019s upbeat speech in the Portuguese resort of Sintra last month) Newsflash: Eurozone economists have cut their forecasts for inflation in the currency bloc, and hiked their growth forecasts. That\u2019s according to the latest ECB survey of professional forecasters, which highlight why Mario Draghi was so cautious yesterday. Economists now expect inflation to average 1.5% this year, just 1.4% in 2018, and 1.6% in 2019 -- all down 1.5% compared with April\u2019s survey. Low inflation is good for the shoppers, of course, but it means the ECB is still struggling to hit its target of getting inflation back to almost 2%. On a positive note, the forecasts have also raised their forecasts for growth over the next few years: Every British sports fan knows that you underestimate an Australian at your peril. And overnight, a top Australian central banker launched a Steve Waugh-style counterattack against speculation that an interest rate rise is imminent. Guy Debelle, deputy governor at the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), argued convincingly that his central bank wouldn\u2019t be forced to follow Canada\u2019s central bank, which hiked rates last week. Debelle said: \u201cJust as the policy rate in Australia did not need to decline to the very low levels seen in other parts of the world, the fact that other central banks increase their policy rates does not automatically mean that the policy rate here needs to increase.\u201d This dovish talk sent the Australian dollar sliding, making it the worse-performing major currency today. Adam Cole of RBC Capital Markets argues that the euro\u2019s rally is misplaced. There is really nothing in Draghi\u2019s remarks yesterday that calls for this kind of bullishness on the euro and markets may end up getting disappointed before long. European stock markets have dipped into the red in early trading, on fears that the stronger euro will hurt exporters. In Germany, shares in BMW, Volkswagen and Continental are all down around 0.75%. Yogi Dewan, CEO of Hassium Asset Management says the stronger euro could hit profits: \u201cIt added to jitters about whether we\u2019ll get the earnings growth that everyone is hoping for.\u201d Curiously, eurozone government bonds have actually strengthened this morning, pushing down the interest rates (or yield) on the debt. You might expect them to have moved the other way, if the European Central Bank was really poised to trim its bond-purchase stimulus programme [which has been pushing prices up]. Chris Whittall of the WSJ agrees that it\u2019s hard to square this with the euro\u2019s rally: It may indicate that investors have been convinced that the ECB will be in the market for a very long time, as Mario Draghi promised. It may also show that they have faith in Europe\u2019s recovery, and believe that the eurozone debt crisis really is over... The chatter in the City today is that the euro could hit $1.20 against the US dollar soon, for the first time since January 2015. Bob Parker, investment committee member at Quilvest Investment Management, told CNBC that he expects the European Central Bank to trim its bond-purchase programme this autumn, and end it next year. That would drive the euro higher. Parker says: Investors believe that the ECB QE programme will go to \u20ac40bn per month during the fourth quarter of 2017 [from \u20ac60bn today] and that the negative deposit rates will go. This has been my view for the last three months and I assume that QE will end in 2Q18 [the second quarter of 2018].\u201d There\u2019s no holding the euro back this morning! The single currency has romped to a fresh two-year high in early trading, as traders anticipate that the European Central Bank will cut its stimulus programme in the next few months. The euro has jumped to $1.1677 against the US dollar, its strongest position since August 2015. The euro has also hit an eight-month high against the pound, at 89.77p, making foreign holidays more expensive for Brits. Yesterday, ECB chief Mario Draghi said his governing council would discuss its bond-purchase scheme in the autumn. That opened up the possibility that it could decide to trim the pace of the programme at September\u2019s meeting. The ECB is planning to buy \u20ac60bn of debt each month with newly created money, up until December 2017. It also voted yesterday to keep interest rates at record lows. Draghi did insist that the ECB would remain in the market for a long time, pointing out that inflation in the euro area is stubbornly below target. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the euro surging higher. And Peter Kinsella of Commonwealth Bank of Australia thinks it has further to go. He told clients: \u201cIt\u2019s an armour-plated rally and it won\u2019t stop.\u201d \u201cEverything speaks in favour of further euro appreciation -- increasing portfolio inflows, changing monetary policy, improved political risks.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The main event today is Britain\u2019s public finances for June. With consumer spending subdued, and businesses fretting about Brexit, these figures will show how much the UK borrowed to balance the books last month. They should also indicate whether the UK is on track to hit its deficit targets this year. City economists predict that the public sector net borrowing requirement (excluding the impact of state-owned banks) fell to \u00a34.7bn last month, down from \u00a36.7bn in May. Last night, consultancy firm Fathom warned that the risks of a UK recession in the next year are now over 50%, so weak public finances might indicate that firms are struggling. Alternatively, a strong reading would reassure investors. Last week, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility warned that Britain\u2019s public finances are vulnerable to shocks, as a recession is inevitable sooner or later.... We\u2019re also getting a new inflation report from Canada, and a fresh count of how many oil rigs are pumping away in the US.

Transfers are up by 78 per cent in the first three months of 2017-18 from a year ago, having been down more than 40 per cent in the final two months of 2016-17. This timing effect explains most of the year-to-date increase, while around a fifth of it is attributable to an additional \u00a30.3 billion payment in relation to historical adjustments to the calculations of VAT- and GNI-based contributions. <br></li> <li><strong>Self-assessment (SA) receipts will be depressed in 2017-18 by the unwinding of the income shifting ahead of the April 2016 dividend tax rise.</strong> We expect receipts to fall \u00a33.9 billion on a year earlier, but unlike the two spending factors, which are already evident in the data, this will only affect the public finances in early 2018 when self-assessment payments are due.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OBR_UK/status/888358452262731776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Spending pushes deficit higher - read the latest commentary at <a href=\"https://t.co/k0nGloBMMW\">https://t.co/k0nGloBMMW</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/6UpU6raBtG\">pic.twitter.com/6UpU6raBtG</a></p>&mdash; OBR (@OBR_UK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OBR_UK/status/888358452262731776\">July 21, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5971d890e4b041971a9fc946\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-21T10:45:18.061Z\">11.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The big picture from today\u2019s public finances is that the national debt kept rising over the last year, and is heading towards \u00a31.8 trillion.</strong></p> <p>The ONS says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) was \u00a31,753.5 billion at the end of June 2017, equivalent to 87.4% of gross domestic product (GDP), an increase of \u00a3128.5 billion (or 3.6 percentage points as a ratio of GDP) on June 2016. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3c49cb2c48449bbb2c14cc70d17624a5c2f7f9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3c49cb2c48449bbb2c14cc70d17624a5c2f7f9c/0_0_934_783/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK National debt\" width=\"500\" height=\"419\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK National debt</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s more useful to look at national debt in terms of the size of an economy, rather than as a raw figure.</p> <p>So in GDP terms, Britain\u2019s debt pile is now its largest since the 1960s, when it was paying down the cost of the second world war:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15dd9a1b878f02a83e3504dc4d951ed6bf8c34af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15dd9a1b878f02a83e3504dc4d951ed6bf8c34af/0_0_729_369/500.jpg\" alt=\"Britain\u2019s national debt over the decades\" width=\"500\" height=\"253\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britain\u2019s national debt over the decades</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office for Budget Responsibility</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5971d4f7e4b02c8c10c42af4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-21T10:21:57.623Z\">11.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u2019s my colleague Phillip Inman\u2019s take on today\u2019s public finances:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK borrowed more than expected in June, with the country\u2019s budget deficit rising to \u00a36.9bn - almost 50% higher than the same month last year.</p> <p>Higher inflation forced the government to spend more on financing its debt mountain, other factors included lower GDP growth in the first quarter, a fall in corporation tax receipts and a bigger than expected contribution to the EU budget in June .

jump in Britain\u2019s borrowing last month</a> shows that the public finances have deteriorated, according to John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist.</strong></p> <p>But he\u2019s hopeful that Britain could still hit its deficit targets, as last year\u2019s borrowings have been revised down.</p> <p>Hawksworth says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cJune saw a modest deterioration in public finances, with borrowing around \u00a32 billion higher than a year earlier. This followed two months in which the deficit was almost identical to the year before. The general pattern is consistent with the OBR\u2019s March forecast that we might see some increase in the budget deficit this financial year, as the economy slows and some one-off favourable factors from last year unwind.</p> <p>\u201cNonetheless, the deficit may still come in below the OBR\u2019s \u00a358 billion forecast for 2017/18, given that the deficit in 2016/17 is now estimated to be \u00a35.5 billion less than the OBR projected in March. So the increases in borrowing we are now seeing are from a lower base.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics fears that the public finances show that UK growth was weak in the last

The 15-year-old was taken from his seat on flight EZY8333 to Toulouse on Thursday morning, and left alone at the departure gate. Casper Read, a schoolboy from Worthing, West Sussex, was taking only his second flight alone, to stay with relatives in France. His mother helped him check in at the airport with his bags before he went through security to the gate. Read was given a boarding pass for seat 9A but after texting his mother to tell her he was aboard, another passenger claimed his seat. With the plane overbooked, Read was told to leave the plane. He texted his mother, Stephanie Portal, who returned to the airport and found staff to help locate her son in departures. Read\u2019s grandparents had already embarked on the two-hour round trip to Toulouse from their home to meet him. Eventually, Portal persuaded easyJet to allocate her son a seat on the final departure of the day to Toulouse, although she said the airline\u2019s system apparently showed all four flights on Thursday were overbooked. The final flight, scheduled to depart at 6.40pm, was delayed by almost three hours, meaning Read finally arrived in Toulouse well after midnight. Portal said: \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. They left him alone in departures. Luckily, I had still not got on board my train to London and could come back and find him. If I had not been there I don\u2019t know what would have happened \u2013 he\u2019d have had no money for the train back or anything.\u201d A spokeswoman apologised \u201cfor any inconvenience caused\u201d, adding: \u201cEasyJet is sorry that Casper Read\u2019s flight from London Gatwick to Toulouse was overbooked. We are investigating why he was able to board the aircraft as he should have been informed at the gate. \u201cEasyJet has a procedure to protect unaccompanied minors but unfortunately this was not followed on this occasion and so this will also be investigated.\u201d Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet, said: \u201cThat is really not what we would want. It\u2019s just not our way.\u201d She said that on average easyJet had five no-shows on every flight, but she denied that the airline had problems with overbooking, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t see an overbooking issue. We don\u2019t tend to overbook in peak periods.\u201d Airlines worldwide have come under increased scrutiny on overbooking since an incident where a passenger was forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight. David Dao suffered concussion, lost teeth and a broken nose when he refused to leave his booked seat to make way for crew, and was dragged away by airport police.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has paid compensation to only five of the 67 victims of the HBOS Reading fraud scandal almost a month after its own deadline for making redress offers for the \u201cutterly corrupt scheme\u201d that left small business owners \u201ccheated, defeated and penniless\u201d. The bank, which was until recently part-owned by the government, said on Friday that just five of its customers had accepted its offers of compensation. It has failed to make any offer to more than half of the victims and the bank\u2019s bosses confirmed that some of the customers were threatening to take the company to court rather than accept any deal. Lloyds, which owns HBOS, had pledged to agree compensation deals worth \u00a3100m before the end of June. The bank said on Friday that it had made final offers to just 16 customers and only five of these had been accepted. It said a further 14 cases were in \u201cthe final stage of assessment\u201d by the bank and Prof Russel Griggs, an independent reviewer. Adrian White, Lloyds\u2019 chief operating officer for commercial banking, said: \u201cWe are continuing to make progress in getting offers to victims of the HBOS Reading fraud. We have now either made offers or are in the detailed assessment stage for nearly half of the victims in the review. It is important we get the fullest possible information from victims to ensure we can factor in everything that could contribute to their compensation offer.\u201d Lord Cromwell, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on fair business banking, said he was very concerned about the progress of the compensation scheme, which he described as a \u201crunning sore\u201d. \u201cColleagues in both Houses of Parliament are very concerned, and are increasingly raising formal questions, about how this matter is being conducted\u201d he said. \u201cIn particular there appears to be a lack of transparency, and therefore a lack of public confidence, in the processes set up unilaterally by Lloyds for assessment and settlement of claims. Inevitably this creates suspicion and we are hoping that Lloyds will now accept our repeated invitations to make the processes \u2013 including the nuts and bolts of valuing claims \u2013 far more open to assessment by victims and their advisers. Without that it is hard to see how this matter can end other than in bitterness and litigation.\u201d Lloyds had denied that there was any wrongdoing at its Reading branch until two of its former employees were convicted of fraud in February. A group of six bankers dubbed \u201cBritain\u2019s Wolves of Wall Street\u201d were jailed for combined 47 years and six months for a complex scam at HBOS\u2019s Reading branch between 2003 and 2007. At the sentencing, Judge Beddoe said Lynden Scourfield, a former senior HBOS manager, had \u201csold your soul, for sex, for luxury trips with and without your wife \u2013 for bling and for swag\u201d. Scourfield had pleaded guilty to the extensive scheme, which drained the bank and small businesses of around \u00a3245m and left hundreds of people in severe financial difficulties. The judge described Scourfield as an \u201cutterly corrupt bank manager\u201d who, driven by \u201crapacious greed\u201d, had \u201cgot his tentacles into the businesses of ordinary and honest people and ripped them apart without a thought for those affected\u201d. The Thames Valley police commissioner, Anthony Stansfeld, has criticised Lloyds for failing to accept that the scam took place despite \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d, which he said amounted to a cover-up. Some of the victims lost their companies, livelihoods and even their homes as a result of the scam. Paul and Nikki Turner, from Cambridge, were ignored for years when they tried to report what was going on after their publishing company, Zenith, was run into the ground in the scam. \u201cThey defrauded us, denied for 10 years that the fraud had happened, ignored the debt from the fraud and tried to evict us 22 times in order to cover up the fraud,\u201d Nikki Turner has said. The Turners have said they will not negotiate compensation with Lloyds and will take the company to court. Lloyds has issued one-off payments of \u00a335,000 each to victims to cover their costs as they wait for compensation. The bank said the total offers and payments to victims total \u00a310m so far.",

A group of six bankers dubbed \u201cBritain\u2019s Wolves of Wall Street\u201d were jailed for combined 47 years and six months for a complex scam at HBOS\u2019s Reading branch between 2003 and 2007.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6961ebbda09f71782c4b6e64ff60d8cfa68b4cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6961ebbda09f71782c4b6e64ff60d8cfa68b4cf/0_74_511_307/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lynden Scourfield (right) with David Mills (centre) and Michael Bancroft, who were convicted of fraud\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lynden Scourfield (right) with David Mills (centre) and Michael Bancroft, who were convicted of fraud.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thames Valley Police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the sentencing, Judge Beddoe said Lynden Scourfield, a former senior HBOS manager, had \u201csold your soul, for sex, for luxury trips with and without your wife \u2013 for bling and for swag\u201d.</p> <p>Scourfield had pleaded guilty to the extensive scheme, which drained the bank and small businesses of around \u00a3245m and left hundreds of people in severe financial difficulties.</p> <p>The judge described Scourfield as an \u201cutterly corrupt bank manager\u201d who, driven by \u201crapacious greed\u201d, had \u201cgot his tentacles into the businesses of ordinary and honest people and ripped them apart without a thought for those affected\u201d.</p> <p>The Thames Valley police commissioner, Anthony Stansfeld, has criticised Lloyds for failing to accept that the scam took place despite \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d, which he said amounted to a cover-up. </p> <p>Some of the victims lost their companies, livelihoods and even their homes as a result of the scam.

      "bodyText": "SSE lost nearly a quarter of a million customers in the three months to June as it warned that it faced \u201ccomplex challenges\u201d this year. The UK\u2019s second biggest energy supplier has been shedding customers at a faster rate than before, with the exodus of 230,000, and 210,000 households switching to rival suppliers in the last financial year. The \u201cbig six\u201d firm, which is now down to 7.7m customer accounts, put up its energy prices by 6.9% or \u00a373 in April. It blamed the losses on a \u201chighly competitive\u201d retail energy market. There are now a record 58 firms in this UK market and the so-called challenger firms are gradually taking a larger share of the pie. In April, during the flurry of price increases by five of the big six suppliers, 41% of the switches were from larger firms to smaller ones. However, recent figures show that that share fell back in June, to 35%. Of the big six, SSE has the highest percentage of customers \u2013 91% \u2013 on standard variable tariffs, the default rates that bill-payers move on to when cheaper, fixed, deals come to an end. Such tariffs were criticised as a \u201crip-off\u201d by Theresa May and ministers during the general election campaign, and both the Conservatives and Labour threatened to impose a price cap on them. But the plans have since been hugely watered down and it looks likely that 14 million fewer people will have their energy bills capped than May promised. The energy regulator, Ofgem, held a summit on Monday with consumer groups to discuss what form a \u201csafeguard tariff\u201d would take. Groups that attended said the talks were encouraging but that future discussions should also cover setting targets for suppliers to shift customers off standard variable tariffs. Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE, has argued that a cap would not help consumers. On Thursday the firm reiterated that view, saying: \u201cCompetition should be at the heart of the retail energy market.\u201d It was revealed last month that Phillips-Davies had been awarded a 72% pay rise, taking his remuneration to \u00a32.92m. His pay was approved by 98.19% of votes cast at the company\u2019s AGM on Thursday. In a trading update on Thursday, the group said milder temperatures between April and June had curbed household energy use. Electricity consumption was down by 3.4% on the same period in 2016, and gas consumption fell 15.4%. However, higher wind speeds meant power generation from its windfarms was up by more than a fifth. Phillips-Davies said: \u201cAs expected, 2017-18 is presenting a number of complex challenges to manage, but SSE is a focused, resilient and adaptable business with efficient operations and disciplined investment at its core.\u201d The group said it was maintaining its target of increasing the year\u2019s dividend by at least RPI inflation, which was welcomed by analysts. SSE\u2019s share price initially fell, but later rallied to close up 0.41% at 1,477p. Households are also fleeing other large suppliers. Rival ScottishPower said on Thursday that it had 100,000 fewer customer accounts at the end of the first half of this year than in the same period in 2016, leaving it with 5.3m accounts. ScottishPower, owned by the Spanish energy firm Iberdrola, said it faced \u201cfierce competition in the UK and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future\u201d.",
