      "bodyText": "The government has been warned that Britain's railways are on the edge of a funding crisis as the industry regulator predicts that Network Rail will amass debts approaching \u00a350bn by the end of the decade. In a report issued on Monday , the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) says Network Rail's interest payments will consume a third of its budget by 2029. The watchdog calls for more transparency on rail funding so that the public can understand the true costs. Alongside direct government funding of around \u00a33.7bn a year, investment in the railways is being paid for by borrowing underwritten by the state. Network Rail's net debt increased by \u00a33.1bn in 2012-13, when it paid out \u00a31.4bn in interest. According to the ORR's projections, by 2020 its debt will have jumped from around \u00a320bn to almost \u00a350bn. Repayment is guaranteed by the government, meaning Network Rail has been able to borrow on the same credit rating as the state. But the ORR says its ability to service its debt and to raise additional finance will depend on future direct government support and creditors' confidence. It adds: \"The burden on future generations to pay for the costs of historic investment will continue to rise as Network Rail's debt grows.\" The growing liabilities the ORR identifies exclude the \u00a342.6bn earmarked for the HS2 high-speed track, a total that was increased by \u00a310bn last month. Senior figures at Network Rail acknowledge that the debt poses a problem but few in the industry wish to draw attention to the \"hidden deficit\" being run up for rail investment at a time when the coalition is pursuing deficit reduction. Tony Travers, the LSE professor and leading public finance expert, said: \"There's a real, fast-growing problem for the government here. The scale of the indebtedness is already perplexing. At some point the debt will damage [Network Rail]. Over time there will be less money available for the maintenance of the railway \u2013 or the government will have to pay off the debt.\" Others raised fears that repayments could affect the railway as it competes for future funds for projects such as HS2. The shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, said: \"Ministers must satisfy themselves that the rising annual cost of servicing Network Rail's debt does not put an unsustainable downward pressure on funding vital day-to-day maintenance of the network, repeating the dangerous mistakes of the past.\" Safety fears have been thrown back into renewed focus by train crash in Paris on Friday that killed six people. The derailment was blamed on a defect in the points system similar to that which caused the Potters Bar crash in 2002. Earlier this year the head of the French railways, Guillaume Pepy, said spending diverted to high-speed trains \u2013 the French TGVs \u2013 had left the traditional track in a state of emergency. Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT trade union, said: \"All of this debt burden increases the pressure on Network Rail to cut corners. People are doing safety-critical work on our railways on zero-hour contracts. Our fear is that safety standards that should be applied won't be, and we'll be back to the bad old days of Railtrack.\" The ORR's projections suggest that the financial pain of commuters is unlikely to ease soon, despite ministerial pledges to end inflation-busting fare rises. Current policy is to increase the proportion of the cost of railways paid for by passengers rather than by taxpayers, with fares to rise by 1% above RPI inflation each year until further notice. Louise Ellman, the Labour MP and chair of the Commons transport select committee, said the debt was one of \"the major reasons for the growing cost of the railways\". The government played down the ORR's predictions. A Department for Transport spokesman said: \"The ORR numbers are illustrations based on assumptions about future investment. It is normal for businesses to fund investment through debt. The government believes that current debt levels are sustainable and reflect decisions from successive governments to invest in rail and we expect strong revenue growth into the future.\" Network Rail sources said the ORR was right to flag up a looming crisis. A spokesman said: \"The model for the railway works now \u2013 it's a cheap way of financing expansion of the railway, which is fine for the next decade. But beyond that we need to have a debate about other ways of financing the railway. Let's not have a crisis in a decade's time, let's start talking to the government now about a model for the future.\" Richard Price, chief executive of the ORR, said: \"ORR wants to ensure that future rail funding is sustainable and the industry is organised to anticipate the future needs of its customers.\"",

      "bodyText": "Farquhar Road, a leafy address in Birmingham's Edgbaston suburb, has homes selling for north of \u00a31.5m. In Glasgow's West End a five-bedroom Victorian terrace can command a seven-figure price tag, while there are hundreds of streets in London where a family will struggle to secure a purchase without \u00a32m to spend. It seems to confirm that Britain is experiencing a house price boom that will, in a couple of years, lead to another spectacular crash. Already opposition politicians and housing experts have warned of the dire consequences of the government's speculators' charter, otherwise known as Help to Buy. The scheme gets round the need for a 20% deposit by offering a taxpayer-funded 20% top-up loan in combination with a buyer's 5% deposit and 75% mortgage. Combined with the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme (FLS), critics argue that it provides yet another sugar rush for a market that is already enjoying a good deal of stimulation. Some economists put the average price rise this year, and next, at a combined 15%. Others have pencilled in more than that. And in the top property hotspots, prices seem to be rising almost every week. As a topic of dinner party conversation, the vaulting price of a half-decent flat or house is back at the top of the menu. Recent evidence also points skywards. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said last week there was a marked pick up in mortgage advances in May, adding that surveys show the housing market is moving out of first gear. Property website Rightmove revealed on Monday that \"all regions are up year-on-year for the first time in nearly three years contributing to the positive national picture\". Yet a closer look at the figures shows the UK is still some way from another crash. There are many ways to judge house price inflation. If we use the Bank of England measure that marries the Halifax and Nationwide indices, the fall in average values since the 2007 peak is 15%. So the expected rise in prices between now and 2015 will only take us back to the previous peak. More importantly, the number of people buying today at the newly inflated prices is small compared with the peak, which means if prices fall, only a few people will get in trouble. A look at the number of transactions adds support to this view. The CML has pencilled in 950,000 transactions in 2013/14 compared with 1.6m in 2007. Repossessions, which are another measure of trouble ahead, are roughly static at around 35,000 a year and the CML expects a small rise to 37,000 next year. The supply of new homes, or lack of it, is particularly important in keeping prices high. Building remains at levels last seen in the 1920s. The construction data for May showed output down almost 5% on the previous year, with private and social house building hardest hit. Private builders reported a surge in profits last week and pointed to Help to Buy and the FLS as key drivers of the buying spree. But they are adding to the housing stock at a snail's pace. Far from sensing a market that can withstand thousands more homes at top prices, they are drip-feeding them into what they perceive to be a relatively fragile situation. Then there are the housing associations. There are plans for them to increase their programmes, though not while austerity is the order of the day. A lack of social housing heaps more pressure on an already over-stretched private home market, pushing up rents and prices further in a way that economists find, in the short term and in the narrowest gauge of supply and demand, entirely justifiable. So at a time when banks are restricted from offering the kinds of crazy loans available before the crash and are better capitalised to deal with unforeseen shocks (and the supply of new homes is atrociously small), there is a certain amount of justification for this price level. High prices, a small number of transactions and restricted supply have many social, political and economic consequences, but are not a reason to panic about a possible crash. No wonder George Osborne told MPs last week: \"The purpose of [Help to Buy] is to repair an impaired mortgage market that is clearly not functioning properly. I don't think the situation at the moment looks like an asset price bubble.\" The problem is that we seem to be at a crossroads where the UK either continues its lost decade of low growth, low wages and severe restrictions on the supply of credit, or we allow a consumer boom built on the credit available through Help to Buy, the FLS and looser ties on bank lending to rescue the economy. Rob Wood, an economist at the private German bank Berenberg, watched the previous boom from his position as an analyst inside the Bank of England. He is concerned about the outlook beyond 2015 when house price rises will take the UK average to new highs. If that occurs without any noticeable degree of wage growth or cut in unemployment, then we will be back in bubble territory. \"House prices thus reach the heart of Britain's current policy paradox,\" Wood said. \"Loose monetary policy works by boosting asset prices and encouraging households and firms to spend now and save later. That boost can prevent depression. But it can only delay the inevitable adjustments of saving, spending and house prices. \"To keep the economy alive today, policy has to do the opposite of what is needed to keep it alive tomorrow. The positive way this plays out is that UK adjustment is less painful in the future. Eurozone austerity is due to ease off next year and the US will be through the fiscal cliff. With a stronger world, UK adjustment could be less difficult in the future\". Wood says relying on other countries to bail out the UK is a risky strategy when the best way to avoid a house price bubble is to build more homes. In fact, he would embark on a wide range of infrastructure projects to bring down unemployment and stabilise house prices. But the British disease could be embedded to the extent that a bubble is inevitable without more far-reaching reforms to a tax system that already encourages speculation in property. Former Bank of England adviser Kate Barker wrote a report for Gordon Brown that said Britain needed around 400,000 extra homes a year to keep house price rises in line with general inflation of 2%. That seems like a pipe dream when the government refuses to back public house builders with cash, relying instead on the private sector. Consumer lobby group PricedOut agrees with the CML and most housing groups that Help to Buy will do little to ensure that more house-building happens over the longer term. It says: \"Boosting buyers' access to credit simply allows house-builders to raise their sale prices to match. This means bigger profits for developers, but even higher house prices for struggling first-time buyers to contend with.\" Only public housing built on publicly owned land, of which there is still plenty, especially in the hands of the Ministry of Defence and local authorities, can save the day.",

      "bodyText": "Politicians should take urgent action to stop small businesses falling victim to Whitehall spending cuts, with towns and cities in northern England among the areas likely to be worst hit, according to a report from thinktank the Centre for Cities. Blackburn, Hull and Liverpool are among the places where small firms will be particularly vulnerable because they are heavily dependent on local demand, and welfare cuts will hit the population particularly hard, according to the 80-page study. Using the same analysis, Cambridge, with its cluster of hi-tech firms, along with Crawley and Reading, are identified as places where local small businesses will be hurt less. Alexandra Jones, chief executive of Centre for Cities, said: \"Small and medium-sized businesses are the lifeblood of the UK's economy but many have been particularly affected by the impact of the recession on their local economies. \"They will face challenges ahead as further austerity measures have a knock-on effect on local demand for their services.\" The report from the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, a respected forecasting body, said the UK's recovery had \"finally got legs\". It almost doubled its forecast for growth this year to 1.1%, up from 0.6% just three months ago. However, the Centre for Cities study, sponsored by the insurer Zurich, warns that some parts of the UK will miss out in any recovery. It is calling on the government to devolve extra powers to local enterprise partnerships \u2013 the key bodies involved in delivering regeneration since the coalition abolished the regional development agencies \u2013 to allow them to tailor business support to their local economy. It also argues that the Department for Business should simplify its complex array of business support schemes; and it calls for UK Trade and Investment, the government body charged with boosting Britain's export performance, to focus on helping smaller firms to develop new markets outside their local area. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \u2013 those with fewer than 250 employees \u2013 make up 99% of firms in Britain's cities, and employ almost half of the workforce. But the data in the report reveal wide variations in how successful different cities have been at nurturing new and growing firms. London, Aberdeen, with its thriving oil services industry, and Reading, in the hi-tech M4 corridor, are the three cities with the most new start-up businesses relative to their population \u2013 72.5 per 10,000 in the case of the capital. At the other end of the scale, just 20.7 new firms were created for every 10,000 people in Sunderland, and only a slightly higher number in Belfast, Dundee and Mansfield. The thinktank identifies a series of factors that tend to help cities to develop healthier small business sectors. Fast-growing cities, with rising populations, such as Milton Keynes and Peterborough, offer expanding markets. A well-educated workforce helps too. Richard Coleman, director of SMEs for Zurich, said: \"It is important that both local government and local business groups not only assess their current small business base and its comparative strengths, but also understand and plan for the changing shape and challenges of the SME sector on the horizon.\"",

      "bodyText": "France has failed to secure backing for tough new international tax rules specifically targeting digital companies, such as Google and Amazon, after opposition from the US forced the watering down of proposals that will be presented at this week's G20 summit. Senior officials in Washington have made it known they will not stand for rule changes that narrowly target the activities of some of the nation's fastest growing multinationals, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been told to draw up a much-anticipated action plan for tax reform at the gathering of G20 finance ministers this Friday, but the US and French governments have been at loggerheads over how far the proposals should go. While the Americans concede that the rules need to be updated, they are understood to be pushing for moderate change. They are believed to want tweaks to the existing wording of international tax treaties rather than the creation of wholly new passages dedicated to spelling out how the digital economy should be taxed. This has put the US at odds with several G20 nations, particularly France, which in January published radical proposals for new concepts in international tax treaties designed to counter some of the avoidance measures deployed by internet firms. Officials at the G20 governments have been working closely with the OECD, a club for the world's industrialised nations, over the proposals. Despite opposition from the US, the French position \u2013 which also includes a proposal to link tax to the collection of personal data \u2013 continues to be championed by the French finance minister, Pierre Moscovici. The OECD plan has been billed as the biggest opportunity to overhaul international tax rules, closing loopholes increasingly exploited by multinational corporations in the decades since a framework for bilateral tax treaties was first established after the first world war. The OECD is expected to detail up to 15 areas on which it believes action can be taken, setting up a timetable for reform on each of between 12 months and two and a half years. Among the areas expected to take longest to produce results is in which jurisdiction a multinational group should pay tax on its business activity, under \"permanent establishment\" rules. Many internet firms' tax structures, such as those of Google and Amazon, exploit loopholes in this area. While the case for broad reform of the international rules has been made repeatedly by top politicians around the globe, in many areas there is limited common ground on what shape new rules should take. As a result, because of its consensus-driven nature, the OECD action plan is expected to contain watered-down recommendations in some areas. Nevertheless, the OECD has already made clear it regards aggressive tax engineering by internet multinationals to be among six \"key pressure areas\" it will address. In a report to the G20 in February it said: \"Nowadays it is possible to be heavily involved in the economic life of another country, eg by doing business with customers located in that country via the internet, without having a taxable presence therein. \"In an era where non-resident [corporate] taxpayers can derive substantial profits from transactions with customers located in another country, questions are being raised as to whether the current rules ensure a fair allocation of taxing rights on business profits, especially where the profits from such transactions go untaxed anywhere.\" However, tensions are thought to have surfaced in the OECD working party looking at how to address the permanent establishment rules in the light of the burgeoning internet economy. This working party is being jointly led by US and French teams \u2013 representing the extremes of opinion among G20 nations. France has been among the most aggressive in responding to online businesses that target French customers but pay little or no French tax.

After hearing his answers, she told him: \"You are a company that says you do no evil. And I think that you do do evil\" \u2013 a reference to Google's corporate motto, \"Don't be evil\". Last month, the Treasury minister David Gauke told backbench MPs who had called a short debate on multinationals and tax avoidance that the government did still hold out hope that shortcomings in international tax guidelines \u2013 specifically in what constitutes a business taxable in the UK under permanent establishment rules - would be addressed by the G20. \"We are leading the way in encouraging the OECD to look at what needs to be done to ensure that the tax rules are brought up to date for the internet world,\" he said. Writing in the Observer in May, the Google chairman, Eric Schmidt, appeared to drop his previously unapologetic defence of existing international tax rules. In the face of building public anger, he conceded that rather than taking up tax incentives offered by governments, his firm and others had built tax structures that had not been foreseen by those who drafted the rules decades ago before the advent of the internet. \"Given the intensity of the debate, not just in the UK but also in America and elsewhere, international tax law could almost certainly benefit from reform,\" he wrote, describing this week's OECD action plan as \"hotly awaited\".",

      "bodyText": "The battle over airport expansion in the south of England is entering a critical week, with the future of Heathrow \u2013 Britain's largest airport \u2013 hanging in the balance. Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, will outline plans to convert Heathrow into a residential area, but he will be opposed by the airport's chiefs who will unveil proposals for further runways. Johnson will on Monday set out three options for a four-runway hub to the east of London, at the expense of Heathrow. His proposals are part of a submission to the Airports Commission, a body appointed by the government to draw up options for new runways. Johnson proposes two new sites in the Thames estuary and an expanded Stansted, with a Norman Foster-designed project on the Isle of Grain in Kent thought to be his favoured plan. At the same time, he will call for the closure or scaling down of Heathrow, claiming the land could sustain a thriving new London borough. Heathrow and local councils have argued that building a new hub would force the airport out of business, causing substantial job losses in the area. Johnson's camp will acknowledge that Heathrow would have no future as an airport under their plans. But he will argue that its transport links make it an ideal location to develop thousands of new homes and businesses in the heart of London's affluent western suburbs. A Heathrow spokesman said: \"It seems extraordinary that any mayor of London would propose forcibly buying and then closing Heathrow. \"The mayor's proposals would leave 114,000 people facing redundancy, cost taxpayers more and take longer to deliver than building on the strength we already have at Heathrow.\" Heathrow will respond on Wednesday with a series of specific options for a third runway, none of which replicate the plans scrapped by the coalition in 2010. One proposal is believed to be a new runway towards Stanwell Moor to the south-west of the existing airport, although the most realistic option is still to the north, where land was safeguarded for a third runway. The village of Sipson, earmarked for demolition before the 2010 election under the third runway proposals, will apparently not be reprieved. It is understood the village features in at least one of the options being proposed. Ahead of the Friday 19 July deadline for submissions to the Airports Commission, Heathrow intends to place the onus on the government \u2013 or at least commission chair Sir Howard Davies \u2013 to pick the preferred option. Heathrow insists that choosing sites for airport expansion is a \"political decision\". The Heathrow third runway plans will include estimates of costs, of the number of homes that would be demolished and the noise impact on surrounding neighbourhoods. Heathrow will also signal that a fourth runway should not be necessary for decades, in an attempt to head off Johnson's demands for a four-runway hub and to limit any public backlash from London residents threatened by noise from new flight paths. The airport and the mayor share the view that expansion in the south-east is essential to safeguard the UK's position as a leader in international aviation. They believe England needs extra capacity at a larger hub airport, with enough connecting flights and passengers to make long-haul routes feasible. This has the backing of some business leaders, who argue that tapping new export markets in the developing world is more difficult without direct flights to destinations in Russia, India, Brazil and China. However, that position is disputed by other airports. Gatwick, for instance, will submit plans for its own second runway to the commission, arguing for a \"constellation approach\" to airport capacity around London. In this vision, Heathrow, Gatwick and an expanded Stansted would provide competition to each other on a more equal footing. Birmingham airport believes that Britain's capacity needs can be met through a network of long-haul airports connected by the HS2 rail line. Manchester Airports Group, which bought Stansted earlier this year, has yet to say whether it supports any of Johnson's or Gatwick's expansion plans for the single-runway Essex airport. The commission will announce a shortlist of new runway options by the end of the year, with detailed studies to be carried out in 2014. It will set out its final recommendations after the general election in 2015.",

      "bodyText": "Many years ago I spotted a correlation (a favourite word among economists) between a certain financial commentator's daily pronouncements on the state of the economy and the weather. When it was sunny, the news was always being interpreted as being good; when it was miserable there appeared to be a sudden downturn in the economic outlook. This came back to me during the recent spell of hot weather: there seems to have been an outburst of optimism about the economy, especially in the rightwing press. It has all been worth it, we are told by the Treasury: the economy is moving \"from rescue to recovery\". Even the International Monetary Fund is revising its UK forecasts upwards, and the newspapers hint that the IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard was quite wrong a few months ago to call for a British \"Plan B\". Now, it was Samuel Beckett who is supposed to have said when asked by a friend if good weather made him glad to be alive: \"I wouldn't go as far as that.\" As one who is glad to be alive in fair weather and foul, I have to say that I would still not risk betting on a sustained recovery and I should never accept the idea that it has all been worth it. It is, for example, stretching several points for the chancellor to claim that he has \"rescued\" the economy when for several years now he has been giving it the 19th century leeching treatment. The message from monthly and quarterly statistics and regular surveys of business opinion can be interpreted in many ways. For instance, economists, especially Americans, like to \"annualise\" new figures: if one does that to the latest estimate from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research it is, in theory, time, if not for rejoicing, then certainly for breathing a massive sigh of relief. Thus the NIESR estimates that in the April-June quarter gross domestic product grew by 0.6%, equivalent to an annual rate of about 2.5%. If this could be sustained, then one could begin to talk seriously of a recovery, although, by past standards it would hardly be sensational. During a typical recovery in previous decades the British economy would grow for a time at 3-4% per annum, before settling down to the long-run average of close to 2.5%. (Figures in real terms, after taking account of inflation.) The NIESR's reasonable definition of recession is \"a period when output is falling or receding\". At the moment it looks as though the recession is over, although, with the banking system still so fragile, and the eurozone far from out of the woods, all hell could yet break loose. But, even on the assumption that all hell does not break loose, and there is a sluggish recovery from now on, the chances of even the 2.5% annualised pace of April-June being maintained are very slim, and outside the sights of most forecasters. As Ed Balls has pointed out, the revised IMF forecast for the UK this year, at 0.9% growth year-on-year (against 0.7% forecast in April) is still below the 1% it expected at the turn of the year. The growth in the second quarter was largely in services, with manufacturing output, on which we depend for almost two-thirds of our export earnings, actually running lower than a year ago. The NIESR uses the term \"depression\" to describe a situation where GDP is below its previous peak; it expects, on current trends, that the peak reached in 2008 will not be regained, at the earliest, until 2015. Of course 2015 will be an election year. The chancellor can be confidently expected to claim that he has worked wonders when all that will have been achieved is a return to the position two years before he took office. It is a lamentable record: the worst recovery ever, under a chancellor who talks about growth and enterprise, and under policies which are causing unnecessary hardship to many of the poorest in our nation. Of course, this depression is taking place at a much higher level of general living standards than in the terrible depression of the early 1930s. And to look around central London, parts of which give the impression that the population is engaged in one perpetual street party, you could be forgiven for thinking that critics such as myself are making it up. But we are not. The cuts are at their most savage in the way that local authorities are being forced by central government to cut back on essential services, and not least in the way that years of neglect, by both major parties, are showing up in the housing crisis. This government's bedroom tax is arguably \"the unkindest cut of all\". The government is also culpable for its sluggishness in recognising the opportunity provided by low long-term interest rates for a major infrastructure programme. We are three years into this coalition and it is only just waking up to the infrastructure crisis, having meanwhile aggravated it with savage cuts in investment. Our cheeky chancellor rationalises the position by claiming that he has \"created the space\" for infrastructure spending. But as the economist John Llewellyn points out: \"If we had had the infrastructure spending, the space would not be there.\" Do not be fooled. There may or may not be a modest economic recovery from now on, but the strategy of fiscal retrenchment to make space for a private sector recovery has been a lamentable failure, at considerable, and needless, social cost.",

But as the economist John Llewellyn points out: \"If we had had the infrastructure spending, the space would not be there.\"</p> <p>Do not be fooled. There may or may not be a modest economic recovery from now on, but the strategy of fiscal retrenchment to make space for a private sector recovery has been a lamentable failure, at considerable, and needless, social cost.</p>",
