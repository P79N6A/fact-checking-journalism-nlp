      "bodyText": "Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest and biggest insurance market, has for the first time called on insurers to incorporate climate change into their models. The call to action comes a day after a landmark US report, named the National Climate Assessment, which has warned that climate change is wreaking havoc across the US. Lloyd's says damage and weather-related losses around the world have increased from an annual average of $50bn in the 1980s to close to $200bn over the last 10 years. The 326-year-old insurance market, whose members write insurance business worldwide, believes the time has come for a formal call on the industry to take into account various climate-change scenarios to avoid unpredictable losses to businesses. What the industry describes as extreme weather events have increased in number and severity as the global climate system has altered, causing more and bigger hurricanes, typhoons and heatwaves around the world. In the UK the main climate-change related risk is flooding. Typhoon Haiyan, which last November swept across south-east Asia, especially affecting the Philippines, was one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded. The year 2011 was the most expensive on record for natural disasters, with insured losses costing the industry more than $126bn. Superstorm Sandy caused $35bn of insured losses two years ago, making it the second costliest hurricane in US history after hurricane Katrina in 2005. A new report by Lloyd's, which consulted the world's largest catastrophe modelling firms, says a 20cm rise in the sea level at the southern tip of Manhattan Island increased Superstorm Sandy's surge losses by 30% (up to $8bn) in New York alone. The 840-page National Climate Assessment, published this week, was described by John Holdren, the White House science adviser, as the \"loudest and clearest alarm bell to date signalling the need to take urgent action to combat the threats to Americans from climate change\". Trevor Maynard, head of exposure management and reinsurance at Lloyd's, said: \"Climate change is very much here to stay. Hurricanes are getting stronger worldwide, and especially over the north Atlantic \u2026 At the moment we are heading for a rise of four degrees [in temperatures] by the end of the century.\" He said that increased threats ranged from property damage to political risk \u2013 such as the implications for food security \u2013 and the economic impacts. It could mean the insurance industry would need to hold more capital to protect against increased risk, he said. Maynard said that while insurers typically arrange insurance cover for a stretch of one year, planners and building constructors would need to look ahead to the next 40 to 50 years. Maynard said: \"There is every indication that [storms] will get more extreme as the temperature rises.\" He noted that the report by Sir Nicholas Stern on the economics of climate change concluded that it was cheaper \"to avoid it\". Lloyd's made a \u00a3516m loss in 2011 after paying out the largest catastrophe claims on record \u2013 caused by earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, storms in the US, and floods in Thailand and Australia. The area flooded in Thailand was the size of Birmingham and it remained under water for a couple of months. Since this year Lloyd's has been run by Inga Beale, who became chief executive of the company in January.

Initially a selection of lighthearted verses penned by the poet Roger McGough (already employed by the grocer as the voice of its TV ads) will appear in all 317 UK stores, from the fish counter to the fruit and vegetable section, and even on the mirrors of the customer toilets. The poet \u2013 known for short comic poems such as \"It's a joy to be old. The dog dead and the car sold\" \u2013 hopes that displaying poems in supermarkets might help to bring poetry to a wider audience. Selections \u2013 some brand new for Waitrose and others adaptations of his existing work \u2013 will appear on the ends of aisles and shelves, as well as on point-of-sale material including \"wobblers\" and on paper tray liners in its cafes. Excerpts of McGough's Keep Your Eyes Peeled will be displayed in fruit and veg sections, for example, while the new Tofu and the Tiger will appear alongside tofu and similar products. McGough told the Guardian: \"It's about putting a smile on people's faces as they head for the fish fingers. Poetry doesn't just belong in the library or on the bookshelf \u2013 it can be equally at home on the supermarket shelf. Poems can celebrate the happy events in our lives as well as consoling us in the dark times. My verses, however, are more of a caress, a tickle, or a poke in the ribs.\" The award-winning poet has visited his local branch of Waitrose in East Sheen, London, to see at first hand how his poetry will be displayed in store. As well as displaying McGough's verses in the Year of Poetry campaign, the retailer is appealing for shoppers to write their own. Each month, six poems by customers will appear in stores alongside McGough's in Waitrose branches. After four months of winning poems, McGough will judge all 24, choosing a top three to be announced on National Poetry Day on 2 October. But senior managers, including managing director Mark Price, will be hoping that the poetry competition does not backfire along the lines of its social media experiment eighteen months ago. When it challenged shoppers to \"finish the sentence: 'I shop at Waitrose because \u2026' #WaitroseReasons\" , it triggered a Twitter storm as internet jokers piled in to ridicule the brand for its posh image. 'Tofu and the Tiger' by Roger McGough for Waitrose If a tiger invites you home for tea And offers you tofu You can take it from me He's only pretending Look at those jaws Were they designed for chewing rice? And those claws For peeling bananas? Take my advice Stay calm, be polite. Eat up your tofu and ask for more When the feline is in the kitchen Make a bee-line for the door.",

      "bodyText": "Amid the political noise, the weakness in Pfizer's share price has received less attention than it should. Last Thursday the US group's shares were trading at $31.15 (\u00a318.37), which was the price used in calculating the value of Friday's cash-plus-shares offer for AstraZeneca at \u00a350. Yesterday, as Pfizer's shares dipped to $29 (\u00a317), the value of the rejected terms fell to \u00a347.50. Last week's proposal was merely a sighting-shot. When Pfizer gets serious its offer will be heavier on cash, which was only one-third of the total last week.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Lord Myners calls for radical overhaul of Co-operative Group", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group needs a radical boardroom overhaul if it is to survive the traumatic shocks of the past year, the City veteran charged with reforming the troubled chain of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies has warned. Lord Myners, Labour's City minister during the banking crisis, described a \"dysfunctional\" board in which some directors did not know the difference between debits and credits and \"clearly out of their depth when financial concepts and terminology are used\". He said he realised within 30 minutes of his first board meeting in January that the board was not up to the job, with discussions ranging from \"some want a dividend, some want low prices, some want to do social good and some want free-range chickens\". Publishing a 180-page report, Myners said the board \u2013 currently made up of members of the co-operative movement such as nurses, farmers and public-sector workers \u2013 was \"stuck in denial\" over what he called a \"near ruinous\" failure of governance, which led to the near-collapse of its bank last year. None of them had quit \u2013 although some had been forced out \u2013 and he questioned why some of them remained. \"This board is not competent to perform the duties expected of it,\" he said, as he called for the Financial Conduct Authority to broaden the scope of its investigation from the bank to the wider group. \"Radical decisions on governance need to be taken soon \u2026 if the Co-op, as my mother knew it, is to be saved,\" said Myners. \"The decision lies in the hands of elected democrats. I have done all I can do.\" Myners unexpectedly quit the Co-op board last month, but agreed to stay to complete his review. Making no apology for setting out in \"stark terms\" the need for urgent reform, he warned that bank lenders owed \u00a31.4bn by the group \u2013 which lost \u00a32.5bn last year \u2013 could force fire sales of its prized businesses to get their money back, or increase the borrowing rate they charge on their loans. Myners said the Co-op would not go bust as it could always sell its funeral homes business for \u00a31bn if necessary. His attacks on the current members of the board sparked warnings that it might now be even more difficult for his reforms to be passed at the annual meeting in 10 days' time. In heated exchanges at the Treasury select committee, Andy Love, a Labour and Co-op MP, questioned Myners about democratic representation of the members under his proposals. But officials at Unite \u2013 concerned about the 90,000 employees of the group \u2013 urged members to back Myners as he was \"the only game in town at the moment that can deliver a future for the group and our members\". Chairman of Guardian Media Group until 2008, Myners warned that one idea of winding the Co-op into a charitable foundation to fund its social purposes could leave little cash behind. Setting out his plans for reform to the Co-op's current governance structure of \"labyrinthine complexity\", Myners also called for an investigation by the City regulator into a report the Co-op commissioned from investigators Kroll into leaks from the boardroom . He also suggested a review of the \u00a31 membership fee \u2013 one and a half week's salary when the Co-op was set up in the 19th century \u2013 the equivalent to \u00a3675 now. Myners first published an outline of his reforms in March after chief executive Euan Sutherland walked out after just 10 months, branding the group ungovernable after his \u00a36.6m pay deal was leaked to the Observer. \"The loss of Euan Sutherland is a catastrophe for the Co-op. He was the right man and forced out by some people who should lower their heads in shame because they certainly did not behave in a way that Co-operative values and principles suggest that they should,\" said Myners. His reforms are little changed from the original, which recommended replacing the current board of 15 representatives from the regional boards \u2013 which represent the 8 million members who own 78% of the group \u2013 and five from the 22 independent societies that own the remainder. A national membership council would be set up and a one-member, one-vote system created rather than the current system, which he says is more like one vote per 10,000 members. Myners, appointed in December, insisted he had not quit because of opposition to his proposals. \"I have myself witnessed repeated instances where there has been a denial of responsibility, corrosive suspicion, deliberate delay and a practice of hiding behind values in order to deflect or stifle criticism and protect self-interest. It was the combination of these factors, when discussing the approval of this year's accounts, that obliged me to resign as a director of the group after only four months,\" Myners said. The board members had been waiting for him to sign the accounts so they would have the confidence to sign them too, he said. He was defiant as he published his reforms: \"It would be completely irresponsible to change my diagnosis because the prescription is unpalatable and hard for some elected members to accept.\" The annual meeting of the Co-op is due to vote on resolutions related to his reforms on 17 May and Myners recommended the reforms be adopted by next year's annual meeting, with the new boardroom structure in place by November this year. He said he hoped the Co-op would allow the media entry to this month's AGM.",

      "body": "<p>The Co-operative Group needs a radical boardroom overhaul if it is to survive the traumatic shocks of the past year, the City veteran charged with reforming the troubled chain of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies has warned.</p> <p>Lord Myners, Labour's City minister during the banking crisis, described a \"dysfunctional\" board in which some directors did not know the difference between debits and credits and \"clearly out of their depth when financial concepts and terminology are used\".</p> <p>He said he realised within 30 minutes of his first board meeting in January that the board was not up to the job, with discussions ranging from \"some want a dividend, some want low prices, some want to do social good and some want free-range chickens\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/MynersReview/News/Myners-governance-report-published/\" title=\"\">Publishing a 180-page report</a>, Myners said the board \u2013 currently made up of members of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/gallery/2014/jan/29/the-history-of-the-british-co-operative-movement-timeline\" title=\"\">the co-operative movement</a> such as nurses, farmers and public-sector workers \u2013 was \"stuck in denial\" over what he called a \"near ruinous\" failure of governance, which led to the near-collapse of its bank last year. None of them had quit \u2013 although some had been forced out \u2013 and he questioned why some of them remained.</p> <p>\"This board is not competent to perform the duties expected of it,\" he said, as he called for the Financial Conduct Authority to broaden the scope of its investigation from the bank to the wider group.</p> <p>\"Radical decisions on governance need to be taken soon \u2026 if the Co-op, as my mother knew it, is to be saved,\" said Myners. \"The decision lies in the hands of elected democrats. I have done all I can do.\"</p> <p>Myners unexpectedly quit the Co-op board last month, but agreed to stay to complete his review.</p> <p>Making no apology for setting out in \"stark terms\" the need for urgent reform, he warned that bank lenders owed \u00a31.4bn by the group \u2013 which lost \u00a32.5bn last year \u2013 could force fire sales of its prized businesses to get their money back, or increase the borrowing rate they charge on their loans.</p> <p>Myners said the Co-op would not go bust as it could always sell its funeral homes business for \u00a31bn if necessary.</p> <p>His attacks on the current members of the board sparked warnings that it might now be even more difficult for his reforms to be passed at the annual meeting in 10 days' time. In heated exchanges at the Treasury select committee, Andy Love, a Labour and Co-op MP, questioned Myners about democratic representation of the members under his proposals. But officials at Unite \u2013 concerned about the 90,000 employees of the group \u2013 urged members to back Myners as he was \"the only game in town at the moment that can deliver a future for the group and our members\".</p> <p>Chairman of Guardian Media Group until 2008, Myners warned that one idea of winding the Co-op into a charitable foundation to fund its social purposes could leave little cash behind.</p> <p>Setting out his plans for reform to the Co-op's current governance structure of \"labyrinthine complexity\", Myners also called for an investigation by the City regulator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/29/boardroom-director-forced-to-leave-the-co-operative-group\" title=\"\">into a report the Co-op commissioned from investigators Kroll into leaks from the boardroom</a> . He also suggested a review of the \u00a31 membership fee \u2013 one and a half week's salary when the Co-op was set up in the 19th century \u2013 the equivalent to \u00a3675 now.</p> <p>Myners first published an outline of his reforms in March after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/11/co-operative-group-chief-executive-euan-sutherland-resign\" title=\"\">chief executive Euan Sutherland walked out after just 10 months</a>, branding the group ungovernable after his \u00a36.6m pay deal was leaked to the Observer.</p> <p>\"The loss of Euan Sutherland is a catastrophe for the Co-op. He was the right man and forced out by some people who should lower their heads in shame because they certainly did not behave in a way that Co-operative values and principles suggest that they should,\" said Myners.</p> <p>His reforms are little changed from the original, which recommended replacing the current board of 15 representatives from the regional boards \u2013 which represent the 8 million members who own 78% of the group \u2013 and five from the 22 independent societies that own the remainder. A national membership council would be set up and<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/07/co-operative-group-structure-8-million-members-voting\" title=\"\"> a one-member, one-vote system created rather than the current system</a>, which he says is more like one vote per 10,000 members.</p> <p>Myners, appointed in December, insisted he had not quit because of opposition to his proposals.</p> <p>\"I have myself witnessed repeated instances where there has been a denial of responsibility, corrosive suspicion, deliberate delay and a practice of hiding behind values in order to deflect or stifle criticism and protect self-interest. It was the combination of these factors, when discussing the approval of this year's accounts, that obliged me to resign as a director of the group after only four months,\" Myners said. The board members had been waiting for him to sign the accounts so they would have the confidence to sign them too, he said.</p> <p>He was defiant as he published his reforms: \"It would be completely irresponsible to change my diagnosis because the prescription is unpalatable and hard for some elected members to accept.\"</p> <p>The annual meeting of the Co-op is due to vote on resolutions related to his reforms on 17 May and Myners recommended the reforms be adopted by next year's annual meeting, with the new boardroom structure in place by November this year. He said he hoped the Co-op would allow the media entry to this month's AGM.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Outgoing Sainsbury's boss Justin King has denied that a new supermarket price war is breaking out, dismissing the aggressive price cuts announced by rival supermarkets as a \"skirmish\". \"Price skirmishes are an ever-present part of this industry,\" King said as the supermarket reported a 5% increase in underlying profits to \u00a3798m. Speaking in the wake of \u00a3300m of price cuts announced by rival Morrisons last week \u2013 the first part of a \u00a31bn move on prices which will halve its profits \u2013 King said: \"I don't want to play the old-man card but I've been around for 30 years and seen plenty of this type of activity in years gone by. We always say we will look at the detail and keep doing the things that have served our business well.\" King, who was presenting his last set of annual results, will hand over the baton to his number two, Mike Coupe, at the company's AGM in July. The changing of the guard comes at a time of major upheaval as the big four supermarkets battle the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl at the same time as Britons increasingly shun the big weekly shop in favour of online transactions and more frequent shopping at convenience stores. King is credited with turning Sainsbury's around by improving its products and shops, opening convenience stores and overhauling supply systems. The group increased sales throughout the recession but announced its first setback in sales for nine years in March. Some analysts believe profits could fall this year after Tesco, Morrisons and Asda announced big price cuts. New industry data from Kantar Worldpanel showed grocery sales growing at their slowest rate for at least 11 years over the last three months as price cuts and easing food price inflation take their toll of the industry's health. King batted away the suggestion he was \"getting out at the top\". \"I am retaining a significant shareholding in the company as an indication of my confidence in the future,\" he said. \"I believe the business can go from strength to strength \u2026 Mike is not assuming the reins on prices; he's actually been responsible for that for the last nine years.\" Coupe said Sainsbury's had more weapons than simply matching competitors' prices. \"Of course, we will match our competitors' prices toe to toe, but our brand is built on differentiation,\" he said, pointing to ethical commitments such as British sourcing, paying a fair price to dairy farmers and selling \"cage-free\" eggs. \"If you go back to 2007/2008 pretty much every commentator had us as most likely to fail in the economic downturn but it's not an exaggeration to say that we've been far and away the best-performing grocer in the last six years, and that's because we believe what we do for customers is unique.\" The Kantar Worldpanel data showed Sainsbury's lost market share in the last three months with 16.6% of the market compared with 16.8% a year ago. The picture was much worse for Tesco, which saw its share drop to 28.7% \u2013 compared with 30% a year ago \u2013 and Morrisons, down from 11.6% to 11%, as both retailers recorded a fall in actual sales. \"There are clear signs that the major supermarkets are reviewing their strategies in the face of increasing competition,\" said Kantar Worldpanel director Edward Garner. \"We're now seeing the big four moving away from 'here today, gone tomorrow' promotions and toward everyday low prices. Lower prices across the board is great for shoppers, but has driven down market growth to its lowest level in 11 years.\" The increase in profits was the weakest of King's reign but compares with declines at both Tesco and Morrisons. Sainsbury's like-for-like sales were flat, and a similar outcome is expected this year. Like its rivals, the grocer is cutting back spending on new stores and plans to open 750,000 sq ft of new space this year, down from 1 million sq ft. Shore Capital analyst Darren Shirley said the industry was in a \"considerable state of flux\", with profit margins coming under increasing pressure. \"To date we have believed that Sainsbury has a relatively differentiated offer, which acts as a barrier to the worst excesses of direct competition,\" he said. \"However, at this juncture we're not so sure.\"",

You shouldn't have gone for a job on the main board in the first place and you should recognise that part of the responsibility for the Co-op's financial condition lies at your door.

      "bodyText": "What did we learn from Lord Myners appearance at the Treasury Committee? (highlights start here)? Understandably, much of the hearing focused on evidence we'd already heard this morning, or was explained in his report (still online, here) Myners took the opportunity to rip into the inadequacies of the Co-op Board again (did one member really think rented shops could be sold off to raise funds?!). None of them, he said, had the abilities needed to run such a company - with one board member's experience extending as far as the local golf club. He said no board members had the skills to serve effectively, and rejected notion that they could be trained up to the mark - if such a course existed, there would be a stampede. He even blamed their incompetence on his decision to quit Co-op after just three months -- saying board members didn't have the skills to appraise the Group's financial reports. And reiterated that the resignation of Euan Sutherland (in a row over his pay packet) was a bitter blow. Many MPs, particularly on the Conservative side of the committee, appeared to welcome and support the report. But Myners did face criticism, from Labour and Co-operative MP Andy Love, who accused him of failing to recognise the point of the co-operative movement. Those values could be destroyed if Myners plan is implemented, Love claimed - a suggestion the ex-City minister rejected. Myners agreed that there was a 'cosy cabal' at the heart of the Co-op, who didn't want to give up their power and pay. But the tangled web of conflicts of interest must be shattered, he insisted. It can't be right to have people serving on the board of the Co-op, and the Co-operative Party, if one is funding the other..... Myners raised the stakes ahead of the AGM on May 17, saying that regulators could be forced to send inspectors into the Co-op if his recommendations are rejected. He made some intriguing political comments, some apparently aimed at George Osborne. Myners claimed the present government had pushed for the Project Verde deal, and then argued that the Group shouldn't be regulated as a bank if the branch sales had gone through. He also denied that the Labour government, in which he served, had pushed for the ill-fated merger with Britannia Building Society. Myners argued that the Co-op Group should cut its funding of affiliated bodies, including the Co-operative party, and put all political donations to a full vote. PWC are investigating all the Co-op's donations -- we will see that report, won't we?.... But overall, the hearing covered plenty of familiar ground -- no surprise, given Myners has been on the airways and most news websites since 7am. And that's a good moment to wrap up for the night. Cheers. GW Here's a pithy explanation of the changes Lord Myners is proposing, via Reuters: Myners said the Co-op should create a new streamlined board led by a chairman with no previous association with the group, six or seven independent non-executive directors and two executive directors. Myners also recommended a National Membership Council be set up, consisting of about 50 individuals, including around 10 employees. This council would elect a steering committee of 12 members including representatives from independent societies. In addition he proposed all Co-op members be given the right to vote on the election of board members, the right to attend general meetings and to approve significant transactions. My colleague Nils Pratley has analysed Lord Myners report, and concludes that the Co-operative Group cannot risk ignoring its recommendations, as it famously did when Hugh Gaitskell urged reform in the 1950s. Here's a flavour: Being led by eager, earnest but unqualified amateurs is no way to run an organisation with 90,000 staff and a turnover of \u00a312bn when the main competitors are fierce beasts like Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Aldi. The report contains an extraordinary quote from an anonymous board member: \"In a democracy, if I am elected and not adequately trained, then is it my fault?\" Yes, it is, actually. You shouldn't have gone for a job on the main board in the first place and you should recognise that part of the responsibility for the Co-op's financial condition lies at your door. It is astonishing that mass resignations from the boardroom have not followed the \u00a32.5bn loss and the accumulation of heavy debts. Myners names no names but is all too easy to believe there really are directors who are confused by the difference between a creditor and debtor. More here: Co-op can't limp on for another 55 years: back the Myners reforms Speaking of Pfizer/AstraZeneca, the CEOs of both companies will be quizzed by parliament's Business, Innovation and Skills committee next Tuesday. They will also hear from the heads of the Unite and GMB unions. The next day, the Science and Technology committee will have its say (as explained at 2.18pm) Here's a video clip of David Cameron answering questions on the other hot business issue of the moment -- Pfizer's takeover bid for AstraZeneca: Finally (as the division bells ring out to summon MPs to a vote), Lib Dem John Thurso asks Myners whether the committee can separate the question of the Co-op's failings from the question of the future of the co-operative movement? Yes, Myners says. And with that, the session is over as the Treasury Committee's finest head to the lobby. Myners warns that there is \"a tangled conflict of interest\" at the heart of the Co-op, contributing to its woes. Some board members also serve on the board of the Co-operative Party (to whom it donates money), while others (the independent members) can be running a store just a few hundred yards from a Co-op supermarket, so face their competitors across the boardroom table. Oh, missed this line about the folly of the Project Verde deal, but the Telegraph caught it: Should the regulators take a closer look at the conduct of the Bank board? Lord Myners says that in his younger days, people talked about the DTI inspectors being sent into a troubled company. Regulators could appoint an inspector to examine the conduct of the Co-op's board, yes. But that would be undesirable, costly, and distracting. He runs through an alphabet soup of existing inquiries into the Co-op. Another one isn't needed. BUT....if the Co-op ignores the need for change, I don't think the regulator could ignore the problem, Myners adds. If you reject change, it will be forced upon you, he says. But the Co-op should want to reform itself. Myners says the Co-op Group needs to sell assets to reduce its debt. It must also cut the money it gives to affiliated parties, including the Co-operative Party, he says. Myners has recommended that a firm of accountants examines the whole area of funding - PWC are now on the case. I have asked for their report to be released to the whole membership, not just the boardroom, he says. The Co-op needs to be open and transparent. Are you saying that the political donations should be put to the vote at an AGM? Yes, says Myners. The current process is deeply flawed and undemocratic. Has the reduction of the Co-op's stake in its own bank, to 20%, removed its 'baleful' influence on the division, asks David Ruffley MP. Myners says he mainly focused on the Group, once he discovered the full scale of the problems at its core. Committee member Brooks Newmark tweets that Lord Myners is giving a \"devastating\" account of the Co-op's failings: Indeed.... Back to the Co-op Bank -- MPs have cited the example of the Rochdale Pioneers (hurrah!), who were driven by the need to satisfy demands that weren't being met by the market. Banking is not an area of unmet need today, Myners suggests. Andrew Tyrie MP calls him up on this -- the committee has heard plenty of evidence that people can't get decent current accounts, or even find a good bank in their area. Are you sure there' s no unmet demand, m'Lord? Myners says he has pondered the causes of problems in Britain's banks for a long time - and whether lack of supply was a factor. He reckons there may be unmet demand for, say, ethical banking - but not for more bricks and mortar branches. Myners also denies that the Co-op's problems today means the organisations' founding principles are dead. I am an enthusiastic supporter of the concept of co-operation and mutualisation, he insists. Myners reckons that in 1950, the Co-op Group would have been worth as much as Sainsbury, Tesco, Asda and Morrisons put together. How did the Co-op Group lose half its value since 2010? Myners explains that, on top of the bank losses, it suffered from bad decisions such as keeping hundreds of empty stores. This is an alarming tale; one board member reckoned they were an asset that could be sold off - Myners had to explain they were a liability, and Co-op was paying rent above the market rate - so couldn't shift them. It also suffered from over-distribution, he adds. Myners says that the merger with Britannia Building Society in 2009 caused huge destruction of value -- a point also made by the Kelly Report into the Co-op last week (probing the Co-op Crisis is turning into its own industry). You were a minister at the time, though, Lord Myners -- did you help push the deal through? We were at the height of the banking crisis at the time, Myners replies -- there were bigger issues to deal with. But could Co-op board members have been starstruck when they met Labour politicians at party conferences and suchlike - and been encouraged to do the deal? Sheer speculation, Myners replies. No more than the speculation that the current government pushed for the Lloyds branch deal? Myners says ministers have admitted they facilitated the Verde deal (not the same as pushing it though). George Osborne even welcomed it. MPs say they were astonished by a recent interview on Newsnight by Paul Flowers, in which he painted a quite different picture of the ill-fated Project Verde (the bid to take over hundreds of Lloyds branches). Flowers told Newsnight that he came under considerable pressure from the government to get the Project Verde deal done -- something ministers have denied. Mark Garnier says Myners has painted a picture of a parish council running the Co-op Group. How did this impact the management of Co-op Bank? Myners says that there was little practical difference between the Group and the Bank. City regulators focused on the Bank board - they should have paid more attention to the Group board. If they had, they would have had more concerns, he argues. Myners says it was a mistake not to treat the Co-op Group as a financial entity for regulatory purposes if Verde had gone through -- rather than a funerals and pharmacies chain with a banking arm. He says the regulator should not have been dissuaded, as a letter from the Treasury suggests it was, from paying more attention to the Group. In reply to John Mann MP, Lord Myners explains that the Co-op's governance problems were created when the Co-operative Retail Society and the Co-operative Wholesale Society merged in 2000. That merger led to the loss of one member one vote, and the removal of the right of all members to attend the AGM, he says. Mann, who serves on a Co-op committee himself, asks Myners if he is saying that people are too cosy in these positions, and that it's a cosy cabal looking after each other? You're right, says Myners, saying the inexorable rise of executive pay has contributed to inequality in the UK (Myners, incidentally, has chaired Guardian Media Group, Land Securities and Marks &amp; Spencer over the years). Mann cites an example of a Co-op meeting where he warned the Group to beware financial problems, but his fellow members were more interested in discussing plastic bags. You were right to caution them about the need to take the situation seriously, Myners replied. The Co-op spent too much time worrying about the size of chickens coops, and not enough on the Big Picture. Andy Love, Labour and Co-operative MP, and Lord Myners now trade blows over the report. Love reads from a recent Financial Times article criticising Myners' review, which warns that his recommendations were not compatible with co-operative values. Myners says the FT will revisit its verdict now the full report has been released. Love hits back -- saying Myners has failed to recognise the Co-op's unique feature and its democratic structure. By recommending dismantling it, he risks undermining the favourable parts of his report. In increasingly tetchy exchange, Myners says that the Co-op was paying a dividend worth \u00a31bn in today's money. It now pays no dividend. Love reiterates that ditching the link to regional and local areas will weaken the co-operative values. What's undemocratic about One Member, One Vote, Myners asks. There is nothing in here that is anti mutual or anti-co-operative. Myners claims that most Co-operative members support him -- the problem lies with those at the top, who aren't keen to relinquish power and give up their fees. Has life been tough at the Co-op since you resigned? Myners jokes that he has reasonably tough skin - reminding MPs that he appeared before this committee to explain Sir Fred Goodwin's pension (signed off by Myners as City minister). He also shows some sympathy with Co-op veterans, faced with an outsider like Myners who has been making uncomfortable truths, loudly. He adds that the Co-op's banks will force it to take further action to rebuild its financial health. Jesse Norman MP asks about the leaking of confidential information from the Co-op. Myners replies that Co-op has been \"beset by leaks\" for the last year. That has caused serious damage, including driving out a \"first class CEO\" in Euan Sutherland. The board asked investigation firm Krollto look into the system, and that led them to ask Mr Stuart Ramsey to leave. Myners cited the Co-op's PPI misselling compensation as another sign that it wasn't being run properly. Myners explains that the Co-op board had a flawed belief that the management were \"on tap, not on top\". One reckoned they couldn't sack Co-op Bank CEO Peter Marks because he was making the big profits. That, Myners says, is often a reason to take a very close look at someone.... He also reiterates that the board lacked experience - one member had only served on a golf club before.... Conservative MP Brooks Newmark asks Lord Myners to define the skills needed for a successful director. They should stick to their ground, be polite to others, knowledgeable about business issues, and understand the context in which the business is operating, Myners replies And what testing was there at the Co-op to assess if board members have this skill set? Myners explains that there wasn't any. OK, so what programmes were run to get board members up to scratch? Myners explains that if such a programme existed, that would turn raw recruits into boardroom warriers capable of running a company big enough to get into the FTSE100, it would be overwhelmed. It's a flawed belief that such programmes could work, he says. After all, Harvard doesn't tell its MBA graduates that they can run a big company. Having got a Harvard MBA, they certainly make you think you can, Newmark jokes.  Newmark also likened the situation at the Co-op to \"A Perfect Storm\". The Co-op can recruit talented non-executive directors to serve on its board, Myners insisted. Reminder - this chart from his report shows how little experience the Co-op board has. After a long decline, the Co-op is at an inflection point -- if it takes the right decisions now, it can enjoy a much brighter future, Myners concludes. Myners explains that his solution is a PLC-plus board -- a highly qualified board, holding the executive to account, complemented by a national council who is charged with checking that the board is doing what it should (acting like shareholders, effectively) He denies that it's a cunning plan to get his friends onto the Co-op board. He also repeats that the Co-op's system, in which board members rose to the top through serving on area and regional boards, was deeply flawed -- creating a small pool of potential talent, and forcing people to resign if they moved from one region to another. Myners is repeating some of the points from this morning's press call -- no-one on the Co-op board had proper business experience, or understood basic financial terms. Andrew Tyrie kicks off the hearing by asking Lord Myners why he resigned from the Co-op board. Myners explains that he became increasingly exasperated by the amateurish approach followed by the Co-op board. He believes that some of the directors hasn't studied its financial reports properly, and were hoping to 'slipstream' him by waiting for the former City minister to sign them off first. Lord Myners is appearing before the Treasury Committee now to discuss his report into the Co-op - it's being streamed here. The Russian stock market is rallying, and so is the ruble, after President Putin called on separatists on Eastern Ukraine to postpone their referendum on independence. Putin said Russia will do \"all it can\" to resolve the Ukraine crisis and will take a \"most positive\" approach to international piece efforts. Putin also said Russia had withdrawn its forces from the border with Ukraine, according to the Interfax news agency. A sign that the escalating tensions in Eastern Ukraine could now calm? It's sent the MICEX index surging 4.5% (see graph above), and pushed the ruble up 1% against the US dollar. More details of Lord Myners' call for a wholesale shake-up at of the Co-op's incompetent board -- apparently he thinks only only one member should stay on. Would the Treasury Committee be kind enough to ask him whom, at 3.15pm?.... Parliament's Science and Technology committee has announced it will take evidence from AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot on May 14. They will also hear from two senior Pfizer executives - Mikael Dolsten, President, Worldwide Research and Development, and Rod Mackenzie, Group Senior Vice President. Science minister David Willetts is also appearing. Andrew Miller MP, Chair of the Science and Technology Committee, said: \u201cAstraZeneca is one of the bastions of the UK\u2019s world-leading pharmaceutical sector. It supports around 30,000 jobs, many of them highly skilled, and is an important component of our scientific landscape. Next week\u2019s hearing will be an opportunity for us to scrutinise the pledges on research and development being made as part of this potential takeover and pose questions about how the Government will ensure that these commitments are met.\u201d Here's the announcement: Proposed takeover of AstraZeneca All that winter snow was bad for productivity, but it did give Americans more time to sit at home and play addictive games on their phones and tablets. Maybe that's why social and mobile game King Digital reported such strong results today -- with profits doubling in the first quarter of 2014. The firm, famous for Candy Crush Saga, reported strong demand for its new game Farm Heroes. The company floated on Wall Street in late March -- shares are up 3.4% in pre-market trading to $19.41, but still below its IPO price of $22.50. Over to America, where the latest productivity figures confirm that the US economy took a nasty jolt over the winter, when bad weather gripped the country. Output per worker fell by 1.7% (on an annual rate) in the first quarter of 2014, the first decline in a year. That wipes out most of the 2.3% rise in productivity seen in the last three months of 2013. And labour costs jumped by 4.2%, suggesting firms were forced to pay more to staff to overcome the ice and blizzards that struck America in January. Last week, GDP data showed that the US economy barely grew in the first three months of 2014 - some economists reckon it actually contracted. Reminder - Lord Myners is due before the Treasury Committee this afternoon to discuss his proposals for the Co-op Group, from around 3.15pm. He's been a busy bee -- telling Sky News that the Co-op needs an \"almost total\" clear out. Back to the Co-op, and Professor John Thanassoulis of Warwick University isn't convinced by Lord Myners' proposal for a new governance structure. Myners wants the Co-op Group board to be made up of executive office holders and non-executive independent members. Thanassoulis fears that it is too close to a traditional PLC board set-up (something Myners has been denying this morning), and is not the best way to guarantee uphold co-operative values. He sais: This is the key proposal and it eschews the learning from all other governance models outside those of the Plc. If members do not have a seat at the top table then the independent directors will be almost unassailable. Independent directors are liable to be chosen from those experienced in running supermarkets/banks/pharmacies from the private sector. Those who have made a career successfully defending shareholder interests are liable to behave in a similar way on the co-operative board. \"Lord Myners is right that a Board needs talented individuals who are not corrupt. But the challenge surely is to create a governance structure whereby this is achieved. Here's another flavour of David Cameron's comments on Pfizer: \"The commitments that have been made so far are encouraging...But let me absolutely clear, I'm not satisfied. I want more but the way to get more is to engage.\" Another question about Pfizer at PMQs - about whether AstraZeneca jobs are at risk if a takeover goes through. David Cameron repeats that it was \"absolutely right\" to ask the cabinet secretary to engage with Pfizer. He says the pledges made by the US company last week - including completing AstraZeneca's plan to move its headquarters and research facilities to Cambridge by 2016 -- are encouraging. Over in Parliament, David Cameron and Ed Miliband have clashed over Pfizer's attempts to take control of AstraZeneca. Miliband warned that a takeover would have serious long-term implications for UK jobs, exports and science, and asked whether the government will apply the public interest test to the deal. Cameron doesn't say whether he'd rule in, or rule out, using the test. He then defends the government's decision to speak to Pfizer. We make \"no apology\" for engaging with Pfizer -- we're fighting for British science, rather than sitting on the sidelines, he says. Andy Sparrow has full coverage of Prime Minister's Questions in his liveblog: Cameron and Miliband at PMQs: Politics live blog So, how did the Co-op end up with a such a dysfunctional board, lacking the competence to run it? Lord Myners' report explains in some detail how the Co-op's three-tier electoral structure is an anomaly -- people are elected to the Area Committee, then the regional board, and then to the Group board. That means: 1) a small pool of possible candidates to run the business 2) Constant pressure on those who reach the board, who must regularly be re-elected to each tier of the group. 3) Potential individuals with \u201cskills but not time\u201d \u2013 particularly younger members \u2013 are put off from trying to rise to the top, as serving the Co-op can be an almost full-time job (as explained at 9.44am, you can be paid over \u00a340,000 per year for it, too) Myners also argues that this has left the Co-op with a serious skills gap, compared to the non-executive directors (NEDs) on the boards of rival companies: Myners also accuses some board members of a casual disregard for their own weaknesses, writing: As one Group Board director put it: \u201cIn a democracy, if I am elected and not adequately trained, then is it my fault?\u201d Here's Reuters' story about the PM's spokesman's comments re AstraZeneca: Britain should consider whether existing takeover laws giving ministers power to intervene in deals could be applied to U.S. drugmaker Pfizer's approach for London-listed AstraZeneca, Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman said on Wednesday. Cameron's spokesman told reporters that the Prime Minister agreed with Business Secretary Vince Cable who on Tuesday said the government needed to consider whether a 'public interest test' should be applied to any potential takeover. Reuters is reporting that David Cameron's spokesman has agreed that the government should consider whether a takeover of AstraZeneca is in the public interest (presumably at this morning's lobby briefing). BRITISH PM SPOKESMAN SAYS AGREES OF NEED TO CONSIDER IF PUBLIC INTEREST TEST APPLIES TO POTENTIAL PFIZER TAKEOVER OF ASTRAZENECA As if Lord Myners didn't have enough on his plate with the Co-op, he's also found time to weigh in on Pfizer's attempt to take control of AstraZeneca. Myners told ITV News it was a mistake for prime minister David Cameron to act as a \"cheerleader\" for Pfizer, and believes the authorities should assess whether the bid is in the national interest. Today's economic data is a rather mixed bag, including a shock drop in activity across Japan's private sector. Markit's monthly \"composite PMI\" index, which tracks output across thousands of Japanese firms, tumbled to 46.3 in April, down from 52.8 in March. That shows a pretty sharp drop in activity (the 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction). Analysts are blaming the hike in Japan's sales tax at the start of April, from 5% to 8%, which risks undermining prime minister Abe's efforts to inflate the Japanese economy and stimulate growth. Separately, German factory orders slid 2.8% in March, suggesting its economy isn't rattling along quite as quickly as expected. Domestic orders fell by 0.6% ,while foreign orders dropped by 4.6% - and by 9.4% from the eurozone countries. The Ukraine crisis is taking some of the blame, given Germany's close business links with Russia. The German economy warned there could be further disruption, as firms temporarily hold back from placing new orders \"due to current geopolitical events.\" HSBC has become the latest bank to report a drop in profits, as tough conditions in foreign exchange and bond trading dented its earnings. The bank reported a 20% drop in pre-tax profits for the first three months of 2014, to $6.785bn, and warned that customer activity stayed \u201cmuted\u201d in April. Strip out one-off items, and profits were down 13%. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver said:: \u201cGlobal banking and markets had a relatively good performance and we grew our market share in several product categories. Commercial Banking saw revenue growth but, in our Principal Retail Banking and Wealth Management business, revenues were impacted by changes in incentive plans and product pricing.\u201d Our Sean Farrell is on the HSBC conference call now, tweeting the key points: Back to Leeds Crown Court, where my colleague Helen Pidd reports that the reverend Paul Flowers has pleaded guilty to three charges of possessing drugs. The former Co-op Bank chairman been fined \u00a3400, and ordered to pay \u00a3125 in costs. Flowers was charged with two counts of possession of Class A drugs \u2013 cocaine and methamphetamine \u2013 and one count of possession of the Class C drug ketamine. Onto other business. And Britain's love affair with new cars remains undimmed, according to new data this morning. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports that sales were 8% higher than a year ago in April, at 176,280. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said Britain's strengthening economy was driving the market: \u201cThis marks 26 consecutive months of growth as GDP continues to pick up, inflation falls and wage levels improve.\" This has prompted the SMMT to ramp up its forecast for sales in 2014 as a whole, from 2.3m to over 2.4m. Hawes explains: \u201cAs UK economic confidence improves still further and the market continues its upward trend, we have revised our 2014 forecast up from 2.3 million to over 2.4 million registrations. This represents an increase of more than 6% versus last year.\u201d While Lord Myners was fielding questions on his report, the disgraced former chair of the Co-op Bank was arriving at Leeds Crown Court. The reverend Paul Flowers is accused of possessing drugs including cocaine and crystal meth. Our Northern editor Helen Pidd is there, and tweets that Rev Flowers arrived before the court was even open. The Unite union has urged Co-op delegates to back Lord Myners' recommendations. Myners report is the only chance to deliver a future for the Co-op and its members, and guarantee jobs, argued Unite national officer, Adrian Jones, who warned: \u201cOur members embrace the Co-op\u2019s unique ethos and have been working tirelessly to make the group a success, but they are increasingly feeling frustrated that their livelihoods are being overlooked in the internal power struggles over whether to reform the group. A quick recap: Former City minister Lord Myners has warned that the current board of the Co-operative Group is not competent to carry out its duties, in a press conference call to discuss his report into the crisis at the Co-op, published this morning (and online here). Myners said the current board lacks the expertise and business know-how required, and has allowed previous management to \"run circles\" around them. It needs a new \"PLC-plus\" set-up, of experienced independent directors working alongside the management, rather than today's set-up where people rise to the top through the Co-op's local area and regional boards. He said the resignation of former CEO Euan Sutherland was a 'catastrophe' for the group. Myners warned that the Co-op's banks are likely to take a \"greater interest\" in the company, if it does not make the changes he recommends. He expects it will continue with its plan to sell its farms business and pharmacy chain, but warned there is \"reluctance\" at the board level to accept the need to dispose of some assets. He argued that the future of the Co-op, with its 100,000 employees across the UK, was a serious national issue - contrasting it with the furore over Pfizer's attempts to take over AstraZeneca, which employs 6,700 in the UK. If the Co-op gets it right, and adopts his recommendations at its AGM on May 17, it could still have a bright future, he suggested. Myners believes the independent societies who own around a fifth of the Co-op will back his plan, with one exception. But he has no idea how delegates representing the Co-op's regional bodies, and its 8 million members, will vote. During the call, Myners also pointed out that Co-op Board members also sit on their local area committee and regional boards and many also take on other paid governance roles. This means that, for some, it can be quite lucrative, he agues. This table, from today's report (online here) has the details. The report says that All current Group Board members sit on an Area Committee and Regional Board and many also take on other paid governance roles either on Group Subsidiary Boards and committees and/or on the boards of sister organisations. And lay board directors received between \u00a318,000 (for part of the year) and \u00a344,000 in 2013 - depending how many roles they performed. Lord Myners concluded the press call by saying that he has played the role of a doctor, during his assessment of the Co-operative group. I have examined the patient in a lot of detail, he says, and I have prescribed what the patient needs to do. But it's not up to the eight million members, it's up to the 100 elected democrats [the delegates from the regional boards] from the regions who will vote at the AGM on 17 May. Myners thinks that he will get the support of all but one of the independent societies - who own 22% of the Co-op. But he has no idea how the 15 regional members, who represent the 8 million members, will cast their block votes. And, curiously, the vote takes place on the Saturday morning -- followed by the debate on the report!. Another example of the \"topsy turvy\" democracy which one associates with the Co-op Group, Myners concludes. And that was the end of the call. The loss of Euan Sutherland as CEO is a catastrophe for the Co-op Group, Lord Myners says. He was forced out by some people who should \"lower their heads in shame\", he added. Sutherland quit in March, after details of his \u00a36.6m pay package were leaked to The Observer. The Co-op is the least well placed of the 10 major grocery chains to cope with a major price war, Myners says. But he adds that its head of food, Steve Murrells, is \"first class\". Myners expects the Co-op will press on with the sales of its pharmacy and farms operations, and will come under pressure to sell its funerals business too. On governance issues, Myners says that the Co-op members never voted on the decision to fund the Co-operative party. And he never heard the board discussing the recent price cutting in the supermarket business. Should the Co-op board resign? Myners replies that the current board does not includes anyone with a background in business. That was clear within half an hour of my first board meeting, he says. They have a complete inability to understand the basic issues and ask the right questions. The model where people are elected to regional boards, and then to the top board, simply doesn't work, Myners says, concluding that: This board is not competent to perform the duties expected of it, he concludes. My colleague Jill Treanor asks about Paul Myners suggestion that the Co-op could potentially be wound down into a charitable foundation to fund its social purposes. Myners says he doesn't think this should happen -- the Co-op should be able to run its portfolio as well as anyone else. And there is a crying need for a business on the high street that trades ethically and identifies with its customers. Myners concludes: There is a very bright future for the Co-op if it gets its act together. What is the situation with the Co-op's banks? Lord Myners says he has not had contact with them directly, as that wouldn't have been appropriate. But it would be a shame if the group had to sell prized, cash generative assets to satisfy its lenders. And he repeats his concern over the mistakes made by its bank - including the attempt to buy hundreds of Lloyds branches. This group should never have had overall control of a bank, he adds. And he's astonished that the press won't be allowed to attend the Co-op's AGM this month - hardly the sign of an open, transparent organisation. Myners adds that the Co-op's share of the grocery market has fallen from 30% in the 1950s to 5% today. In recent years, a company that should have been run sensibly and conservatively has been run \"rather recklessly\", he adds. (Update: The report states that \"In 1950, the Co-operative Movement\u2019s share of grocery sales was 21.3 percent\", so maybe I misheard the 30%.....) Onto questions: Is Myners confident that the Co-op's members will accept his recommendations? He replies that it's hard to know, because the Co-op has such bad membership records (does it really have eight million members?). But if it doesn't, it will decline into irrelevence And the decision comes down to the small number of elected members who will attend the AGM later this month. Myners repeats that he is not proposing a PLC structure, instead it's \"PLC plus\" (with management and competent experts working alongside them). Myners points out that the Co-op employs 100,000 people in Britain (compared to just 6,000 at AstraZeneca). It's future is a serious national issue, he says. The Financial Conduct Authority needs to look into how an organisation with 8 million members could run up such huge losses, says Myners. Myners insists he is not calling for a PLC-style board, but a set-up that is used by many private firms and organisations. Namely, a blend at the top of management and serious, experienced people with the confidence and competence to run the company. Myners is scathing about the current Co-op board - saying that management has \"run circles around the board\" in the past. And the current management deserves a better board, he adds. If the Co-op doesn't heed the message in today's report, then its banks could take an even closer look at the situation at the Co-op, Myners warns. The current governance structure has led to horrendous losses, and debts that are simply too high - and much higher than its commercial competitors. And we're off, with Paul Myners explaining that today's 200-page report is \"one of the most thorough public documents ever produced on the governance of a major group\". The press conference with Lord Myners should start in a few minutes -- they're playing some classical music right now (Vivaldi?). Lord Myners has already been on the Today Programme to discuss the report. He warned that since 2010 the Co-op has managed to lose half the net value accumulated in the previous 150 years. And he also accused the current board of lacking the skills to ask the right questions, as some members didn't understand the difference \"between a credit and a debit\" Lord Myners begins his review with a reminder of how the Co-op has played such an important role over the last century and a half, and why there's such anger over its recent fall from grace: When I was a child growing up in Truro, Cornwall, my mother told me that I should always try to spend my pocket money in the Co-op in Kenwyn Street. I asked her why. She told me \u201cBecause they are different from the other shops. We own the Co-op. It\u2019s for people like us.\u201d I found this difficult to comprehend given our straitened circumstances, but I have never forgotten the message.

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. After 150 years, the future of Britain's Co-operative Group is in the spotlight today as City veteran Lord Myners publishes his long-awaited report into the troubled organisation. And it's a blistering read -- the former City minister warns that the Co-op needs drastic reforms to save it from the crisis that grips the group. He blasts the way that the Co-op's governance structure has \"lamentably failed\", and calls for a new board that actually has the skills and experiences to run the organisation. As City editor Jill Treanor reports this morning: Lord Myners, Labour's City minister during the banking crisis, set out in \"stark terms\" the need for urgent reforms to the chain of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies as he warned that the banks \u2013 owed \u00a31.4bn by the group which lost \u00a32.5bn last year \u2013 could force the organisation to embark on fire sales of its prized businesses or increase the borrowing rate on loans without a commitment to change. Publishing a 180-page report, Myners said the board \u2013 which he wants to abolish, and currently made up of members of the co-operative movement such as nurses, farmers and public sector workers \u2013 was \"stuck in denial\" over what he described as a \"near ruinous\" failure of governance, which led to the near-collapse of its bank last year. \"Radical decisions on governance need to be taken soon \u2013 and with resolution \u2013 if the Co-op, as my mother knew it, is to be saved,\" the 66-year-old said. \"The decision lies in the hands of elected democrats. I have done all I can do.\" Myners, who dramatically quit the Co-op last month, also accused the Co-op's top staff of shying away from the near disaster at the group, which lost control of its own Banking division after running up a \u00a31.5bn capital blak hole. He says: I would say that the Group Board and many on the Regional Boards are still stuck in denial over this near ruinous failure of governance, whereas the vast majority of ordinary members feel justified anger. MPs on the Treasury Committee will quiz Lord Myners over his report this afternoon, from around 3.15pm. He'll also be holding a conference call to discuss the report, from 8am. I'll be tracking the reaction to the report, along with other news through the day as usual...",

      "bodyText": "Pfizer has sought to dispel fears that its proposed \u00a363bn takeover of AstraZeneca would lead to big cuts in British drug research, a day after Britain's second-largest drugmaker touted its 10-year growth strategy as an independent company. The news came as the Anglo-Swedish company's fourth-largest shareholder came out in support of the board's rejection of the approach. Sweden's Investor AB, which owns 4.1% of AstraZeneca, said it was \"backing the board\" of the company \u2013 the biggest investor so far to publicly back the drugmaker's battle to stay independent. An infographic (pdf) published by Pfizer hailed the benefits of a tie-up, with 82 products in the pipeline, and carried a quote from the former GlaxoSmithKline boss Sir Richard Sykes. \"Pfizer are serious and they've got a lot of money to spend. They'll need first-class people doing first-class research,\" it said. During prime minister's questions, David Cameron rejected claims that he was \"cheerleading\" for Pfizer, saying he was \"fighting for British jobs\". \"The commitments that have been made so far are encouraging,\" he said, referring to pledges from the US firm to complete AstraZeneca's planned scientific campus in Cambridge, to base 20% of the new company's research and development workforce in the UK and to manufacture more here. But Cameron added:\"I'm not satisfied, I want more, but the way to get more is to engage.\" Sweden's finance minister, Anders Borg, said Pfizer failed to honour promises made on research jobs when it bought Swedish drugmaker Pharmacia in 2002. He told BBC Radio 4: \"Our experience shows that their track record is not very convincing and I think one should take these kind of promises not only with a pinch of salt but a sack full of salt.\" The backlash against Pfizer's takeover approach is growing, with the former City minister Lord Myners saying Cameron was ill advised to get drawn into becoming a \"cheerleader\" for the proposal. Myners also told ITV that it is \"simply not acceptable\" to say the tie-up is not a matter of public interest and cannot simply be left to shareholders. AstraZeneca's chief medical officer, Briggs Morrison, who spent five years at Pfizer, told reporters of his concerns over the commercial culture at the maker of the Viagra and cholesterol drug Lipitor. AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, brought a new focus on science when he took over from David Brennan, a former salesman, 18 months ago. \"We are trying to create an organisation where the whole organisation is focused on science,\" Morrison said. \"I didn't have the feeling that every part of [Pfizer] was science based.\" It also emerged that two of Cameron's senior advisers have been paid by Pfizer in the past \u2013 Mark Textor, a strategist hired by the Conservative party who has lobbied on behalf of the drugmaker, and Gabby Bertin, now the No 10 press secretary, who was paid \u00a325,000 by Pfizer to work as a researcher for the former defence secretary Liam Fox's contentious Atlantic Bridge charity. The Unite union says AstraZeneca's 6,700-strong UK workforce has a right to know what links the Tory government has to Pfizer. Unite's assistant general secretary, Tony Burke, said: \"We want to know, and we are sure that the public will want to know, what is the extent of the relationship between the government, Cameron's paid strategists and Pfizer? He added: \"To date the government has been banging the drum for a company that appears to want to put UK jobs and R&amp;D at risk so it can reduce its taxes.

Technology is a major battleground for traditional retailers as a growing number of Britons shop online via their mobiles or use them to check rivals\u2019 prices while browsing in store. The handset follows Tesco\u2019s foray into computing last year with the Hudl tablet. Like the Hudl, the phone will be pre-loaded with apps for the grocer\u2019s shopping sites and digital services such as music and video streaming. Amazon is also gearing up to release an own-brand smartphone, after the success of its Kindle Fire tablet. Clarke told BBC Radio 5 Live that the Android phone would compete with \u201cthe best smartphones available\u201d. The phone would be aggressively priced, he said, pitching it against Google\u2019s Nexus 5, which at around \u00a3300 undercuts the competition by \u00a3200. Tesco declined to give further details ahead of the launch. A new model of the Hudl, which sold 400,000 units in its first three months and had subsequently sold a total of 550,000, will be released this September, it said. Clarke, who is under pressure to turn around Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, also indicated he wished to stay at the helm until 2020. \u201cI\u2019m 54 and I have been at it for 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI think normally in Britain people like me retire at 60 and that gives me another six years.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British appetite for new cars surged ahead in April, as a rosy outlook for the UK economy triggered an upwardly revised sales forecast in 2014. New car registrations rose 8.2% last month, to 176,820 vehicles, marking the 26th month of rising sales and matching the previous longest period of expansion, in the late 1980s. It followed a 17.7% increase in March, which is typically a strong period for registrations because it is a plate change month. Demand and an improved economic backdrop prompted the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the trade body which publishes the data, to revise its forecasts for new car sales in 2014 from 2.3m to more than 2.4m. That would be a 6% increase on 2013. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: \"After the bumper plate-change month of March, the UK car market returned to more modest but still positive growth in April. This marks 26 consecutive months of growth as GDP continues to pick up, inflation falls and wage levels improve.\" April's registrations took the total in the first four months of the year to 864,942, up 12.5% on the same period in 2013. Sales have been supported in recent months by the wide availability of car finance deals and a rising demand for more fuel efficient vehicles. The bestseller last month was the Ford Fiesta, followed by the Ford Focus and the VW Golf. The UK economy grew by 0.8% in the first quarter of the year, following 0.7% growth in the last quarter of 2013. Meanwhile inflation is below the Bank of England's 2% target, unemployment is falling, and wage growth is picking up. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said car sales continued to be a driving force in the economy. He said: \"Private car sales are being supported by a combination of much improved consumer confidence, rising employment, attractive offers and packages, and motorists' desire to buy more fuel efficient cars. In addition, consumers' purchasing power is now improving with earnings growth moving above consumer price inflation.\"",
