      "bodyText": "The oil price crash coupled with growing concerns about global warming will encourage at least one of the major oil companies to turn its back on fossil fuels in the near future, predicts an award-winning scientist and former industry adviser. Dr Jeremy Leggett, who has had consultations on climate change with senior oil company executives over 25 years, says it will not be a rerun of the BP story when the company launched its \u201cbeyond petroleum\u201d strategy and then did a U-turn. \u201cOne of the oil companies will break ranks and this time it is going to stick,\u201d he said. \u201cThe industry is facing plunging commodity prices and soaring costs at risky projects in the Arctic, deepwater Brazil and elsewhere. \u201cOil companies are also realising it is no long morally defensible to ignore the consequences of climate change.\u201d Leggett, now a solar energy entrepreneur and climate campaigner, points to Total of France as the kind of group that could abandon carbon fuels in the same way that E.ON, the German utility, announced plans before Christmas to spin off coal and gas interests and concentrate its future growth on renewables. Pressure on the energy industry to pull out of fossil fuels has grown in recent months with a campaign for pension funds to disinvest from coal, oil and gas. A new report published this week by researchers at University College London deepened the message that vast amounts of oil in the Middle East, coal in the US and gas in Russia cannot be exploited if the global temperature rise is to be held at the 2C level safety limit agreed by countries. Leggett, who once conducted research into shale funded by BP and Shell, chairs Carbon Tracker Initiative, a thinktank which aims to raise awareness among key decision-makers about the risks that fossil fuel investments pose to wider financial stability. He believes the current 50% slump in the price of Brent crude will cause the US shale boom to go bust with potentially alarming consequences for the financial system. \u201cMany of the shale drillers have been feasting on junk bond finance, which was so easy when oil prices were above $100 (\u00a366) but with prices at $50 confidence is going to collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cShould the shale narrative evaporate then it is going to be very embarrassing for all sorts of political promoters of the industry, including George Osborne.\u201d Leggett said that despite the price collapse due to oversupply, he remained convinced the \u201cpeak oil\u201d theory that supplies will eventually be unable to meet demand remains intact. This is not because there are not the oil or gas reserves in the ground to meet future growth, but because they are too costly and environmentally dangerous to produce, he argues. \u201cI would say to both the utility industry and the oil and gas industry: its game over, guys,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have got to identify the point at which it\u2019s all going to be thoroughly changed and you have got to map back from it. \u201cYou have to think strategically. The point to map back from is zero carbon in the energy system, not the electricity system, by 2050, because more than 100 governments want that in the [next UN climate change] treaty being prepared for signing in Paris.\u201d But he also believes the energy industry is privately aware of the problems as it watches its own costs of fossil fuel extraction going up while the costs of solar and other new technologies are coming down. Leggett, who plans to stands down as chairman of the highly successful Solarcentury renewable business he founded to focus on climate change campaigning, holds what he calls \u201cfriendly critic\u201d sessions with the fossil fuel sector these days. The tone of the meetings has changed significantly over the past two years, he said. \u201cBefore it was know your enemy. Now it\u2019s: \u2018Crikey. A lot of this may be coming true on our watch. What shall we do about it?\u2019 There are top-to-bottom strategic reviews going on in E.ON but in other companies as well, utility and oil and gas. So it will be really interesting to see which is the first of the oil and gas companies to break from the pack, although I fear BP and Shell are going backwards not forwards on carbon.\u201d",

But some experts have little confidence that even a large-scale intervention will do much good.</p> <p>\u201cI think they\u2019ve left it a bit too late to do anything about this,\u201d says Russell Jones, of Llewellyn Consulting. \u201cWhat took them so long? This has been building, and getting more and more embedded in people\u2019s expectations.\u201d</p> <p>Economists don\u2019t generally worry too much about short periods of deflation, particularly if they are caused by external factors \u2013such as the plunging oil price. Cheaper energy boosts demand by putting more money in the pockets of consumers in oil-importing countries.</p> <p>But there have long been concerns that in the eurozone, where growth is weak and a number of countries remain in recession, falling prices could become widespread and entrenched \u2013 and that\u2019s what really worries euro-watchers.

      "bodyText": "Prices are tumbling, right across the eurozone. But for consumers from Amsterdam to Athens, this is not a bumper Christmas sell-off: the falling cost of their weekly shop reflects a deep economic malaise. After Brussels statisticians announced last week that inflation had been negative in December, with prices falling at an annual rate of 0.2%, experts warned that without drastic action the eurozone may be sliding towards a Japanese-style deflationary slump. \u201cThis move in December is significant,\u201d said Janet Henry, European economist at HSBC, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the first time that inflation has been negative since 2009 \u2013 in the depths of the crisis \u2013 and it\u2019s going to turn further negative in the next few months.\u201d News that the long-predicted onset of deflation had arrived \u2013 aided by the recent sharp drop in oil prices \u2013 will intensify the pressure on Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), to press on with quantitative easing \u2013 one of the few tactics available to central bankers hoping to reflate the economy when interest rates are already on the floor. But some experts have little confidence that even a large-scale intervention will do much good. \u201cI think they\u2019ve left it a bit too late to do anything about this,\u201d says Russell Jones, of Llewellyn Consulting. \u201cWhat took them so long?
