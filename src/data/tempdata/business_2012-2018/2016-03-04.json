A report by leading employment economists David Blanchflower and Stephen Machin ahead of the budget on 16 March shows that far from hitting a predicted 4% level in the next couple of years, wages will stick at around 2%.

      "bodyText": "Was that it? The year began with warnings to sell up and hunker down for another financial crisis. But now investors have been left scratching their heads after the FTSE 100 enjoyed its third week of gains to soar back to where it started 2016. The index rallied 1% on Friday to close at 6,199.43, just shy of the 6,242.32 level at which it opened the year and above the 6,093 where it closed on the first trading day of the year. It marks a 12% turnaround from a three-year low hit in February as the London blue-chip index slumped along with stock markets around the world. Investors had dumped shares amid a commodities rout and on worries about the global economic outlook and China\u2019s economy in particular. As the sell-off deepened, economists at the Royal Bank of Scotland warned clients: \u201cSell everything except high quality bonds.\u201d Now the FTSE 100 is rallying again, stock market experts warn it still has some choppy months ahead. But at the same time a mood of cautious optimism is spreading in the City. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say we are out of the woods but things are looking a bit better than they were at the beginning of February when the bottom was falling out of the market,\u201d said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at financial spreadbetting firm CMC Markets UK. The fortunes of miners in particular, a hefty chunk of the FTSE 100, have turned around in recent weeks. Rallying metals prices have helped boost the share prices of companies such as Glencore, BHP Billiton and Anglo American. But there were still signs that investors remain jittery, notably the soaring price of gold, long seen as a safe-haven, added Hewson. The precious metal is up almost 20% since the start of the year. \u201cYou have to be choosy about where you put your money,\u201d he said. \u201cI am cautious about this [stock market] rally. Gold prices have rallied alongside it and that could mean investors don\u2019t trust this rally.\u201d Analysts say a combination of factors got stocks off to a bad start in 2016: signs of industrial sector weakness in the US, China\u2019s slowdown and its currency devaluation, sharp falls in the oil price and other commodities, and expectations that the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates four times this year. Bank and commodity stocks were among the hardest hit. Against that backdrop the FTSE 100 suffered its worst opening week to a year since 2000 and continued to tumble until 11 February. Since then, nerves have been calmed by three factors, according to Nick Nelson, head of European equity strategy at Swiss bank UBS. Firstly, slightly brighter economic news out of China and the US; secondly, a pick-up in energy and mining stocks; and finally, a weaker pound, which helps the FTSE 100\u2019s many exporters. Nelson warned that financial markets will remain jittery given the wounds of the last crash are still raw. \u201cWe all anchor to our most recent experiences and if you have been in investment and markets for 10 years or so, what you will remember is 2008-9,\u201d he said. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown, echoed that. \u201cThere is a sense that everyone is perhaps poised for the music to stop and they don\u2019t want to be left without a chair. That explains the stop-start nature of the run we have had,\u201d says Khalaf. That \u201cjumpiness\u201d reinforces a long-standing pattern for markets to be a lot louder on the way down than on the way up \u2013 as seen in recent weeks, he says. But investors should beware of the doom-mongers. \u201cIf you hear people shrieking like that, it\u2019s time to buy in,\u201d says Khalaf. \u201cThe market is irrational ... It\u2019s not something investors should get bogged down in. You shouldn\u2019t focus on where the market is going to be in a month but in 10 years or whenever you need to draw down your money.\u201d George Osborne\u2019s take on the global jitters has been to flag up what he sees as a strong domestic economy prone to risks from overseas. The chancellor warned of a \u201cdangerous cocktail of new threats\u201d and said \u201cthe storm clouds are clearly gathering in the world economy\u201d. The latest economic signals from the UK have been soft, cementing expectations that the Bank of England will hold off raising interest rates from the 0.5% record low to which they were cut seven years ago. But Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at the bank Berenberg, said that many of the factors weighing on business confidence in the UK should prove transitory, not least the EU referendum effect. The underlying picture was one of low unemployment, tailwinds from cheap oil, low borrowing costs and rising house prices. \u201cThere are some risks heading into the middle of the year when we have the EU referendum, which will cause consumers to postpone some discretionary spending and businesses to pause investment, but that will pick up again,\u201d he said. But that was not to say markets will have a steady ride. The kind of herd behaviour seen at the start of the year can overshadow any positive economic factors, added Pickering. So while cheap oil boosts household incomes, if it also sparks a stock market rout people get spooked. \u201cPeople don\u2019t look so objectively at things. When financial markets are panicking they think: \u2018I don\u2019t care about having cheap petrol in my car, my stocks are losing value, I need to get rid of them\u2019.\u201d",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "BHS owners took \u00a38.4m loan from chain", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In March 2015, the owners of BHS took a \u00a38.4m loan out of the struggling department store chain, which is battling to cut costs by making hundreds of staff redundant and threatening to close up to half its shops. The Guardian understands that accounts for BHS show a loan of \u00a38.4m was paid to Retail Acquisitions Limited, a consortium of little-known financiers, lawyers and accountants, in March 2015. The moving of funds from inside BHS is likely to anger landlords who are being asked to accept significant cuts to their rental income by BHS, as well as staff who could lose their jobs as part of restructuring. BHS told staff on Friday that it intends to make 220 people redundant in stores and 150 people in head office. The loan will also increase concerns about the suitability of Retail Acquisitions to turn around the retailer, which employs more than 10,000 people and has a pension deficit of \u00a3207m. Dominic Chappell, the man who led the buyout, has been declared bankrupt twice. A spokesman for Retail Acquisitions said the transaction took place in the days after it bought BHS last March and was an \u201cintercompany loan\u201d to cover \u201cprofessional fees\u201d. The loss-making retailer plans to cut its rent bill through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a type of insolvency proceeding. The restructuring has been dubbed internally as \u201cProject Pipe\u201d by KPMG and BHS. Documents relating to Project Pipe include draft accounts for BHS up to 24 February this year, which show the loan between the retailer and Retail Acquisitions. Sir Philip Green, the retail tycoon, sold BHS for \u00a31 to the consortium in March 2015. The retailer says it needs to cut costs to fund a turnaround of the department store, which will involve installing food departments into shops and modernising the website. As well as cutting more than 350 jobs, BHS will scrap another 100 roles that had not been filled in its head office in recent months, meaning its central operations will shrink by roughly a third. BHS bosses briefed staff about the job losses and the turnaround plan on Friday morning. The core of BHS\u2019s plan is to cut the rent it pays on roughly half its 164 shops, which it is trying to achieve through a CVA. If landlords do not agree to BHS\u2019s demands then the stores are likely to close and more jobs will be lost. A CVA allows a company in financial difficulty to reach a deal with creditors, including landlords, about reducing its liabilities while still trading. The agreement must be approved by 75% of BHS\u2019s creditors at a meeting scheduled for 23 March. CVAs are legal but controversial in the property industry because they allow a company to walk away from its lease obligations. BHS has split its properties into three categories in the CVA: 77 stores that are unaffected; 47 stores that it claims are viable but need a reduction in rent to \u201cmarket levels\u201d; and 40 that need a substantial reduction in rent to survive. The rent reductions it has proposed are significant. Of the 47 \u201cviable\u201d shops, BHS wants the rent to be cut by 75% on 21 stores and 50% on 26 stores. For the struggling 40 shops it wants to pay just 25% of the rent for the next 10 months while it tries to reach a long-term deal that secures their survival. BHS\u2019s demands on the most at-risk sites are so significant that the survival of all its stores is unlikely. Savills, the property agent, has been brought in to assist KPMG and could dispose of unwanted stores. Property agents said that landlords with BHS stores were already looking for alternative tenants. Damian Sumner, head of the retail agency at JLL, said: \u201cThe BHS situation has been rumbling on for a while. It has created a lot of uncertainty in the market and the change of ownership last year further complicated the picture. \u201cThe CVA process will at least give some clarity on the future structure of the business and will allow decisions to start to be made. The majority of stores that are on the potential closure list seem to be the most expensive in terms of rent so it is a question of affordability for BHS rather than purely over renting. \u201cMajor landlords have been putting plans in place for some time to secure alternative occupiers on BHS stores.

He added: \u201cAlthough a difficult process to go through, this sets in motion the comprehensive updated turnaround plan that we have identified, and gives British Home Stores a secure financial footing from which to grow and deliver sustainable profitability. \u201cBHS will continue to trade as usual and we thank our staff and customers for their continued support.\u201d This article was amended on 6 and 9 March 2016 to make clearer that the \u00a38.4 million loan was taken out in March 2015.",

      "bodyText": "Directors of Lycamobile, one of the Conservative party\u2019s most generous donors, face being fined after the company failed to file \u201cacceptable\u201d accounts. The phone card company, which has given the Conservatives more than \u00a31.5m since 2011, is already facing the possibility of a \u00a39.5m bill from HM Revenue &amp; Customs for unpaid tax. It has now failed to submit its latest set of financial accounts, which were due to be filed with Companies House on 30 November last year. A spokesperson for Companies House said it was \u201cin correspondence with Lycamobile UK Limited and [we] are waiting for acceptable accounts to be submitted.\u201d \u201cIf the accounts are not received, Companies House will consider prosecution action against the directors,\u201d they added. Companies House did not say whether Lycamobile had filed accounts that were unacceptable or had not filed any at all. Lycamobile turned down requests for comment. In practice, \u201cprosecution\u201d means a tiny fine of just \u00a3750, a pittance for Lycamobile\u2019s multi-millionaire owner Subaskaran Allirajah, who has become one of the Tory party\u2019s largest donors. But the delay in filing its accounts comes amid a flurry of questions that have been raised over Lycamobile\u2019s operations. The company is in talks with HMRC over a potential tax liability of around \u00a39.5m linked to its complex international corporate structure. Accounts from 2014 reveal that Lycamobile paid \u00a3108m to Lycatelcom LDA, a company based in the Portuguese tax haven of Madeira, ostensibly for mobile phone airtime. The payment, which equates to 76% of its overall cost of sales for that year, had the effect of transferring income to the low-tax jurisdiction. Income accrued at a foreign subsidiary of a UK firm is subject to tax under the Controlled Foreign Company rules. The latest available accounts for this Portuguese division show it had just four employees, despite reporting \u00a3433m of turnover. Two of those employees, Richard and Filomena Benn, run a Madeira-based company that specialises in \u201ctax planning\u201d. Accounts for WWW Holding Company \u2013 another firm in the Lycamobile network \u2013 reveal that HMRC has raised \u201cinitial inquiries\u201d over \u00a39.5m in potentially unpaid tax. It is not clear whether these discussions relate to the Madeira-based subsidiary. However, in a statement buried in the accounts, the firm admits: \u201cThe directors are in the process of assessing the company\u2019s operating model and group structure with regard to the Controlled Foreign Company tax regime.\u201d Tax expert Richard Murphy said Lycamobile\u2019s complex cross-border financial architecture raises questions over its tax contribution. He said the arrangement gave him \u201cconsiderable concerns about the pricing of this contract\u201d. \u201cThese accounts suggest that, firstly, we need more information to appraise the impact of the transactions this company undertakes, including full country-by-country reporting for all the companies with which it has relationships.\u201d He added: \u201cSecond, penalties for late filing of accounts, and prosecutions for doing so, need to be stepped up.\u201d Accounts from previous years show that Lycamobile\u2019s UK arm did not pay any tax between 2008 and 2010, despite generating a turnover of between \u00a347m and \u00a388m. The firm\u2019s most recent accounts also show that auditors KPMG were not able to obtain enough information to sign off on adjustments made to financial information from previous years. KPMG began auditing the firm after Ernst &amp; Young resigned from the duty in 2014. Lycamobile\u2019s failure to file its accounts, hard on the heels of admitting it is in talks with HMRC over its tax affairs, adds to the controversy around the company. An investigation by BuzzFeed revealed that Lycamobile employees were depositing rucksacks full of cash, some containing up to \u00a3250,000, at the Post Office. There is no suggestion of any connection to the late filing of accounts and Lycamobile has said its cash deposits were \u201cday-to-day\u201d banking sanctioned by the Post Office. Another company in Subaskaran Allirajah\u2019s business empire is under investigation in Sri Lanka, over allegations it was used to channel cash to the former president. Again, there is no suggestion of any link between the Sri Lankan investigation and the rest of the Lycamobile empire.",

      "bodyText": "In a late development, President Obama has just spoken to reporters after a meeting with his economic team. Obama declared that the US is \u201cpretty darn great\u201d right now -- a rebuttal at Donald Trump and his \u201cMake America Great\u201d campaign. Our economy is the envy of the world, he claimed. And the president was adamant that his policies had worked, delivering 72 months of jobs growth. The priority is to continue that recovery, giving people better jobs and higher salaries, and making the economy \u201cgrow even faster\u201d. I\u2019ll be back later with the Wall Street close.... A new burst of market optimism has driven shares in London to their highest closing level since the start of 2016. Mining stocks drove the market higher, helped by the sight of copper and iron ore prices touching their highest levels since last autumn. Today\u2019s US jobs report hasn\u2019t scared the horses either, even though the poor wage growth took the shine off a decent rise in employment. The FTSE 100 has closed for the night, and the week, up 69 points or 1.1% at 6,199. That\u2019s its highest close since New Year\u2019s Eve. The Footsie has now surged by 12% since mid-February, when shares hit their lowest level since 2012 amid fears of a new banking crisis and a global recession. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets sums up the situation: Shares in Europe added to early gains after the US employment report eased concerns of a slowdown in the US economy without increasing chances of a faster pace of rate increases by the Federal Reserve. Major averages in both the US and Europe are on track for a third successive week of gains. The strength in equities is largely thanks to oil prices being back close to where they started the year but today\u2019s gains were reinforced by the biggest rise in the fix for the Chinese yuan in three weeks. The stabilisation of the Chinese currency as well as efforts this week by authorities in China to bring down excess capacity in its commodities industries helped miners lead gains on the FTSE 100. Anglo American led the UK index with near double-digit daily gains in hot pursuit from sector-peers BHP Billiton, Glencore and Antofagasta as industrial and precious metals benefitted from a slide in the US dollar. The stock markets are pushing higher, as investors dash to buy shares before the European close in 15 minutes time. Wall Street is now in positive territory, and the FTSE 100 is up 68 points at 6,200, again of 1.1%. Mining stocks continue to lead the rally, amid chatter that the commodity crunch has hit a bottom. Bloomberg News\u2019 Matt Boes has been truffling through the Jobs Report. He\u2019s spotted that unemployment among America\u2019s Hispanic workers fell sharply last month. And the rate of retirements across the labor market dipped a little too. Jason Furman, who chairs president Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, insists that \u201cThis is a very good report\u201d. The fall in the underemployment rate, and the rise in the participation rate, show that the labor market continued to improve, argues Furman on Bloomberg TV. But what about the 0.1% fall in wages in February? Furman agrees that wage growth isn\u2019t good enough. However, January saw unusually high wage growth of 0.5%. On average, the last two months showed wages growing faster than inflation, he says. The drop in average earnings has tainted an otherwise solid US jobs report, says David Cheetham, market analyst at online trading platform XTB.com. Overall the report paints a fairly strong picture of continued strength in the US labour market with the 4-month moving average remaining firmly above the 200k mark and the unemployment rate of 4.9% remains near its lowest level in a decade. The first contraction in average hourly earnings since January last year came as an unexpected shock, although having said that there remains little evidence here of any real weakness in the labour market that would be prohibitive for Fed rate hikes in the not too distant future.\u2019 The financial markets are not particularly impressed by today\u2019s jobs report. Wall Street has just opened, and the Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 13 points or 0.08% to 16,931. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down 0.3% Markets are still up in Europe, though, with the FTSE 100 up 0.5% at 6,163 points - close to its highest levels this year. Despite a month-on-month fall in wages, overall today\u2019s report bodes well for consumption, says Nina Skero, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. Strong job creation will make consumers both more able and, via boosted consumer confidence, more willing to spend. A healthy consumer spending outlook is especially important for the US economy as the country faces challenges on other economic fronts. CEBR agrees that the Fed could raise interest rates again soon -- something Skero calls \u201cunwarranted and premature\u201d. They also sent over this chart, showing the steady recovery in the US labor market since 2010. Richard de Meo, managing director of Foenix Partners, is quite upbeat about the Non-Farm Payroll. He reckons it has \u201cshaken off the doubters\u201d who thought the US economy was weakening. Today\u2019s jobs report is a mixed bag, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. But on balance, he thinks it could tee-up a Federal Reserve rate hike this summer: Overall, it\u2019s clear that labour market conditions are still strong. The lack of a more marked pick-up in wage growth is the only missing element. But as far as the Fed is concerned, it is already seeing a clear acceleration in core price inflation, so it can\u2019t delay raising interest rates for much longer. A June rate hike is coming. Ian Shepherdson, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, has a cunning theory to explain the surprise dip in earnings (from $25.38 per hour to $25.35). He thinks it\u2019s all in the timing. Workers who are paid every fortnight would have received their second wage payment on 15th February, three days AFTER the Non-Farm Payroll survey took place. Shepherdson says: Don\u2019t be taken in by the dip in hourly earnings; it just continues a very consistent pattern of undershooting in months when the 15th \u2013 payday for people paid semi-monthly \u2013 falls after the employment survey week. Same thing in March, but then there\u2019ll be a huge rebound, putting year-on-year wage growth at new highs. This tweet suggests he\u2019s right: Financial commentators agree that today\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll report shows solid job creation, but lacklustre wage growth. Here\u2019s some reaction: Most of the jobs created in America last month were in healthcare, retail, and in bars and restaurants. Here\u2019s a breakdown Health care and social assistance: +57,000 jobs. Retail trade: +55,000. Food services and drinking places: +40,000 jobs. Private educational services: +28,000 Construction: +19,000, Mining: lost -19,000 jobs The BLS adds that: Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (4.5%), adult women (4.5%), teenagers (15.6%), Whites (4.3%), Blacks (8.8%), Asians (3.8%), and Hispanics (5.4%) showed little or no change in February. More Americans are returning to the jobs market. The labor force participation rate rose to 62.9% from 62.7% in February. That means more people are either in work, or looking. That could explain why wage growth is disappointing -- employers don\u2019t need to offer large pay rises if there is still \u2018slack\u2019 in the jobs market. Alan Krueger, Princeton economics professor, says the fall in earnings last month is a blow. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he says: I\u2019m surprised that we didn\u2019t see a pickup in wages....This report, behind the headline jobs number, is disappointing. Put the confetti away. Although job creation was strong, wage growth was not. Average earnings of America\u2019s private workers FELL by 0.1% during February, reversing the 0.5% rise seen in January. That means wages are only 2.2% higher than a year ago. Today\u2019s report says: In February, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls declined by 3 cents to $25.35, following an increase of 12 cents in January. Average hourly earnings have risen by 2.2 percent over the year. Job creation was quite broad-based last month. The Bureau for Labour Statistics says: Employment gains occurred in health care and social assistance, retail trade, food services and drinking places, and private educational services, Job losses continued in mining. The US unemployment rate remains at an eight-year low of 4.9%. Here we go! The US economy created 242,000 new jobs last month -- a better performance than expected. That beats market expectations for 195,00 new jobs And January\u2019s figure have been revised higher too, to show that 172,000 new hires (up from 151k originally). More to follow... Augustin Eden, research analyst at Accendo Markets, reckons Wall Street will be most interested in the earnings figures: We expect markets to concentrate on wage growth rather than non-farm payrolls. It is, after all, inflation that\u2019s the key metric for the Fed right now. The waiting is nearly over. In 30 minute time, the latest US jobs report will hit the tape and we\u2019ll know how America\u2019s employment market performed last month. Here\u2019s what to watch for: 1) How many new jobs were created in February. The consensus is for a 195,000 increase in the Non-Farm Payroll, up from a disappointing 151,000 in January. As usual, Wall Street estimates vary quite widely, from 165k to 220k. Some observers are more pessimistic though, such: There\u2019s also a chance that January\u2019s figures will be revised. 2) Where\u2019s the wage growth? We got a surprisingly strong 0.5% pick-up in earnings growth last month, suggesting that the recovery was reaching workers\u2019 pockets 3) Has the unemployment rate come down again? It hit an eight-year low of 4.9% in January, which should have reassured the Federal Reserve over its December rate hike. 4) But what\u2019s the deeper picture? The labor force participation rate has been close to its lowest in decades, showing that many Americans simply stopped looking for work. Underemployment is another key measure; the report will show how many people wanted to work more hours. Arnaud Masset, analyst at Swiss online bank Swissquote, says the Payroll will shed light on whether America\u2019s economy risks recession this year. Even the most hawkish Fed members have stopped giving overly optimistic speeches, instead becoming more cautious about the US outlook. More and more market participants are wondering if the US economy is on the edge of a recession or whether this is just a temporary setback (apparently the temporary setback has become seasonal since last year\u2026). In our opinion, it is still too early to ring alarm bells.\u201d Demand for Brazilian assets is surging today, after former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was detained by police. Lula was dragged into the long-running corruption scandal that has gripped Brazil for months, when federal officers raided his house early this morning. Our Latin America correspondent Jonathan Watts explains why the move is so important: The detention of the influential Workers party politician \u2013 who is best known by his nickname Lula \u2013 marks a dramatic new phase of the Lava Jato (\u201ccarwash\u201d) probe into bribery and kickback allegations involving the nation\u2019s leading companies and dozens of congressmen. It is likely to further add to the pressure on the government of president Dilma Rousseff, who is already struggling with an impeachment challenge, economic recession and the Zika epidemic. More here: Brazilian police detain former president Lula in corruption inquiry Investors are piling into Brazilian assets, anticipating political change. Brazil is currently suffering a deep recession, and rampant inflation. The Brazilian real has already surged by over 2% against the US dollar, from 3.8 against the $1 to 3.7. The stock market is tipped to leap by 6% when trading begins. Today\u2019s flurry of optimism is also pushing copper to its highest level since mid-November, as Reuters reports: Copper prices rose to their highest in nearly four months on Friday, boosted by optimism about demand prospects and output cuts that will help the market move towards balance. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 1% at $4,905 a tonne at 1048 GMT, on course for its largest weekly gain since September last year. Copper earlier touched $4,933 a tonne, its highest since November 12. Iron ore has hit its highest level since last October this morning, continuing a recent rally. Iron ore is benefitting from reports that China is cutting its steel sector and laying off millions of workers, in an attempt to cut oversupply. But traders should be cautious, given iron ore demand is so closely linked to China\u2019s economic growth. Trimming supply doesn\u2019t guarantee demand for steel, as the Wall Street Journal warned this week. Here\u2019s our take on today\u2019s car figures: It\u2019s a bleak morning for workers at troubled UK high street chain BHS. The company\u2019s owners are planning to cut 350 jobs, and is also threatening to close half its stores unless landlords cut the rent. The job cuts come a day after BHS filed for insolvency protection, as we reported yesterday. My colleague Graham Ruddick has the story: The retailer intends to make 220 people redundant in stores and 150 people in head office. Another 100 roles that had not been filled in BHS\u2019s head office in recent months will also be scrapped, meaning its central operations will shrink by roughy a third. BHS bosses briefed staff about the job losses and the turnaround plan on Friday morning. As well as the job cuts, BHS is threatening to close up to half its stores if landlords do not agree to reduce the rents. BHS has filed a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a type of insolvency proceeding, in an attempt to cut its costs. Here\u2019s the full story: The FTSE 100 is on track to close at a new 2016 high, although the US jobs report could yet change that. After three hours of trading, the blue chip index is up a steady 0.5% at 6161 points. Most other European indices are higher too, following Asia\u2019s lead overnight, meaning global markets are still at a two-month high. Ryan Myerberg, a portfolio manager at Janus Capital, says optimism has come pouring back into the markets recently. He says (via Reuters): \u201cWe didn\u2019t believe the \u2018world is going to end\u2019 story, but the way the mood has changed in the last couple of weeks is just crazy.\u201d Since the beginning of the year it has been like driving down the motorway where every couple of miles a tractor has overturned, whether that be China, oil, the banks, that you have to swerve around.\u201d And this tweet shows how some emerging markets have led the rally in 2016, after a couple of challenging years. Money has been pouring back into gold this morning, driving the price of billion up to a 13-month high. Gold just hit $1274.50 an ounce, up 1% today, its highest point since February 2015. It\u2019s surprising to see gold and shares both rallying. But it appears that gold is in demand from investors who are worried about negative interest rates, which have helped drive down the return on many safer assets. There\u2019s also a theory that Chinese demand for gold could jump if Beijing imposes capital controls, to prevent money leaving the country. The London Stock Exchange has shown by two rivals want to leap into bed with it, by posting a 31% jump in profits for the last year. CEO Xavier Rolet remained loyal to the main suiter, Deutsche B\u00f6rse. He said the merger of equals proposed last week was \u201ccompelling opportunity\u201d to create a dominant new global trading group. But the strong results may also encourage Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which runs the New York stock exchange, to muscle in. It\u2019s already considering its options. Joshua Raymond, market analyst at online trading firm XTB.com, explains: \u201cIt\u2019s been a solid year for the LSE. The focus of course now is whether a rival bid emerges from ICE that could spark a bidding war, or if the firms major shareholders remain convinced a tie up with Deutsche B\u00f6rse on the already announced conditions is the best way forward for the trading house.\u201d Britain\u2019s car industry has posted its strongest February sales growth in 12 years, despite another drop in demand for Volkswagen cars New figures from the SMMT show that the new car market grew by 8.4% year-on-year last month, Some 83,395 vehicles being registered, which is the best performance for a February since 2004: The figures also confirm that the emission scandal continues to hurt Volkswagen. Its car sales fell by 13% year on year, from 7,710 to 6,694. Back to economics...and Italy\u2019s statistics office has confirmed that the Italian economy grew by a measly 0.1% in the last three months of 2015. Newsflash: Social networking giant Facebook is shaking up its corporate set-up, which should mean it pays rather more tax in the UK. The move follows heavy criticism of US tech firms for using complicated corporate structures to cut their tax liability, apparently legally. The BBC\u2019s business editor, Kamal Ahmed, has learned that Facebook will no longer route advertising sales to big UK clients through its Irish operation. He\u2019s seen an internal memo, which explains that: On Monday, we will start notifying large UK customers that from the start of April, they will receive invoices from Facebook UK and not Facebook Ireland, What this means in practice is that UK sales made directly by our UK team will be booked in the UK, not Ireland. Facebook UK will then record the revenue from these sales. The move is expected to \u201cprovide transparency to Facebook\u2019s operations in the UK\u201d, the memo adds. Here\u2019s the full story: Facebook to pay millions of pounds more in UK tax Last autumn, it emerged that Facebook UK has only paid \u00a34,327 in UK corporation tax. It made revenues of \u00a3105m, but booked an accounting loss of \u00a328.5m in Britain in 2014, after paying out more than \u00a335m to its 362 staff in a share bonus scheme. Advertising giant WPP has flagged up the EU referendum as a clear risk to growth prospects this year. WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell warned against \u201cDon Draper-ish\u201d optimism, given the threats to confidence. He cited the conflict in the Ukraine and the Middle East, and also the Brexit risk, telling the City that: \u201cThe somewhat surprising result of the UK general lection (at least to the pollsters), with the Conservatives winning an overall majority, has resulted in an uncertainty-stimulating EU referendum, now pegged for 23 June.\u201d Shares in WPP are up 0.7% this morning, after it posted solid sales growth of 4.9% in the final quarter of the year. Mining shares are now at a four-month high, having rocketed by 25% this year: European stock markets are rising at the start of trading, as investors get ready for his afternoon\u2019s US jobs data. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points, or 0.6%, to 6166 - which is nearly its highest level this year. Mining companies are topping the biggest risers, indicating renewed confidence in economic prospects, particularly in emerging markets. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is making another pitch higher in early trade despite yesterday\u2019s suggestions that the bulls may be running out of momentum. Gains are broad based with natural resources stocks once again finding themselves at the top of the board with continued gains for underlying metals prices still lending support here. After a very ropy start to 2016, world stock markets are now at a two-month high That\u2019s according to the MSCI World Market index, which tracks shares in 46 different countries. As this chats shows, share prices are now back at early January levels, before the stock market turmoil began. The recent rally suggests that investor panic over a global downturn was overdone. Now, though, there is talk about whether the market is over-bought - particularly as this week\u2019s manufacturing and service-sector data has been somewhat patchy. Chris Weston of IG explains why the rally could fizzle out: There is an air of fatigue from the bulls in a number of developed equity markets, but they continue to grind higher.... But the market is in need of some injection of new news to provide an injection of inspiration and cause a new leg higher. It seems unlikely this inspiration comes from today\u2019s US payrolls. Stock markets across Asia have rallied today as investors express optimism ahead of this afternoon\u2019s America\u2019s employment report. Over in Tokyo, the Nikkei gained 0.3%. That pushed the Japanese index to a one-month high, up over 5% this week. Chinese traders showed some confidence too, pushing the Shanghai index up by 0.5%. Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, reckons that investors are less worried about the global economy. They are also anticipating that the US Federal Reserve will be reluctant to raise borrowing costs this year, given recent turbulence. Fujito said (via Reuters): Globally, markets are rolling back the extreme risk-off trading they did in January and February. \u201cPart of the reason is that the Fed seems to be easing its insistence on raising rates.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. One more heave, chaps. After a heavy week for economic data, it\u2019s the big one today - the US Non-Farm Payroll for February, which is due at 1.30pm GMT. The NFP will show how many new jobs were created across America\u2019s economy last month, and also show whether wages picked up or not. Although prone to later revisions, the Payroll is a crucial measure of the health of the US labo u r market, at a time when worries over the global economy are pretty intense. Economists predict that 195,000 Americans got hired last month, leaving the unemployment rate at an eight-year low of 4.9%. Earnings are tipped to rise by 0.2% month-on-month, down from a chunky 0.5% rise in January. A surprisingly good, or bad, Payroll number could give the markets a shunt and renew concerns about a global recession. But as things stand, shares are expected to rise in Europe in early trading, with the main indices called up around 0.5%. Also coming up today.... Japan\u2019s central bank chief Haruhiko Kuroda has been testifying in Tokyo about monetary policy issues. At 9am,, we get the final estimate of Italian GDP for the last quarter. It will probably confirm that the economy grew by only 0.1%. The latest UK car sales figures (for February) also land at 9am. And in the City, we\u2019re getting results from London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) and advertising group WPP. Traders will be looking for news about the LSE\u2019s planned merger by Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse, which could bd disrupted by a counter-offer from America\u2019s ICE.",

The positive report \u2013 in excess of predictions by economists \u2013 caps 72 months of uninterrupted job gains, the longest streak on record. It comes as stock markets in the US and abroad have been rattled by fears of a global slowdown, sparked by worries that China\u2019s economic boom is slowing. On the downside Americans\u2019 wages declined 0.1% from the prior month, putting the annual gain at just 2.2% The report comes as Democrat presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton prepares to unveil her plans to spur jobs and wages growth in a speech in Detroit, still one of the most economically troubled cities in the country despite the widespread jobs recovery. US businesses have now added 14.3m jobs over six straight years. The unemployment rate is half what it was at the height of the recession. In January the Labor Department announced the economy had added a disappointing 151,000 new jobs. December and January\u2019s reports have now been revised with the Labor Department adding 30,000 jobs for the two months. But while jobs growth was better than expected the major gains were in low wage industries. Average hourly earnings were down 3 cents to $25.35 after an increase of 12 cents in January. Retail added 55,000 while manufacturing lost 16,000 after a strong gain of 23,000 jobs in January. The impact of low oil prices on the once booming energy industry. Mining and logging employment, which includes oil extraction, lost 18,000 jobs. Unemployment rates remained far higher for minorities: black and Hispanic Americans were jobless at rates of 8.8% and 5.4%, compared to 4.3% for whites. The unemployment rate for the country overall was 4.5%. Those rates did not change during the month, nor did the number of long-term jobless: still 2.2 million people. The report comes as the Federal Reserve weighs whether to delay a further rise in interest rates. The recent rout on Wall Street, due in part to economic woes in China, has been a major factor in the Fed\u2019s decision to hold off on a further increase, Fed chair Janet Yellen told Congress last month. \u201cWith employment rising at a rapid pace and labour market slack still shrinking, we think the Fed will resume raising interest rates in June. A marked pick-up in wage growth is still notably absent, but that won\u2019t matter to the Fed when there are clear signs of a rise in core price inflation,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. Economists were already predicting job growth for the month, but a Reuters survey of economists turned out to be slightly conservative: the anticipated increase of 190,000 jobs fell short of the mark.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rail campaigners have denounced moves to potentially sell off Network Rail\u2019s power assets as the \u201cthin end of a long wedge\u201d towards privatisation. Network Rail, which owns and operates Britain\u2019s railway infrastructure, including the tracks and many of the biggest stations, has hired KPMG to market its power lines and substations to global investors. It is the second biggest procurer of electricity in the UK after the NHS, and Network Rail\u2019s distribution network includes thousands of kilometres of overhead lines or third rails used to power trains and for signalling. State-owned Network Rail has been told to find new ways of financing its planned works and has already pledged to raise \u00a31.8bn to offset the overspend in its current five-year plan, by selling off property including retail space in stations and station arches. Selling off parts of its power network would be the first time that Network Rail had returned core assets in the everyday operation of the railway to private hands. Its chief executive, Mark Carne, said: \u201cWhile no decisions have yet been made, if there are investors or others with expertise in key areas who can help us do that, then we should look to embrace those opportunities. \u201cContinuing the historically high levels of investment in our railway that we\u2019ve seen over the last decade is absolutely vital if we\u2019re to provide the railway Britain needs in the years ahead. Better railways drive economic growth, housing and jobs. \u201cOur approach is all about financial discipline, with a renewed focus on our core activities while being open and innovative about new sources of finance to fund our growing railway.\u201d The move comes ahead of a review of the financing and structure of rail by the HS1 chief executive, Nicola Shaw, expected to be published alongside the budget on 16 March. The review was commissioned by the Treasury in response to cost overruns in rail engineering projects, as part of a clampdown on spending after Network Rail\u2019s \u00a338bn debt was included on the public balance sheet. The biggest rail union, the RMT, said the move would unleash on rail passengers \u201cthe same global energy companies who are currently robbing Britain\u2019s domestic power customers blind\u201d. Its general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cThe proliferation of contractors and subcontractors is already dragging Network Rail\u2019s performance down and the flogging off of the power assets would simply up the ante on the fragmentation that is the root cause of many of the daily problems hitting services.\u201d He said the plans were \u201cjust the thin end of a long wedge designed to drag the publicly owned Network Rail operations back to the lethal days of the privatised Railtrack\u201d. Railtrack, which ran the railway infrastructure between 1996 and 2002, went bankrupt after presiding over a series of fatal rail accidents, culminating in the Hatfield crash in 2000. Cat Hobbs, the director of pro-nationalisation campaign group We Own It, which held a protest against further rail privatisation at King\u2019s Cross station on Friday morning, said: \u201cAll of this selling off of infrastructure is going to make it very difficult to restore a publicly owned railway, which is what the majority of the public want to see. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to have private monopolies of parts of the infrastructure. We\u2019ll lose public control of the revenue and all the incentive will be to create private profit out of those assets \u2013 and we saw what happened with Railtrack when the railway wasn\u2019t run in the public interest.\u201d Network Rail is also looking at selling off its commercial estate, freight yards, major stations, telecoms assets, depots and land. The shadow transport secretary, Lilian Greenwood, said: \u201cThere are real fears that passengers and taxpayers will pay the price for this fire sale of Network Rail\u2019s assets. These plans will leave Network Rail without valuable long-term sources of revenue which could push up both fares and the overall cost of running the railway. \u201cThis sale is going ahead because the cost of major projects has skyrocketed, but Tory ministers kept quiet about the scandal until after the election.\u201d",

Lord Smith of Kelvin, who replaced Karin Forseke as chair at the start of the year, talked of an \u201ceventful year\u201d that saw activist investor Elliott Advisors challenge the firm\u2019s strategy. This led to a management shakeup including the departure of chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox, and left the wealth manager, one of Britain\u2019s oldest investment firms, with an all-male board of seven non-executive directors. Smith, who also chairs the government\u2019s flagship Green Investment Bank, said he was \u201cacutely aware of the lack of gender diversity on the current board as a result of the recent changes\u201d. He added: \u201cAlliance Trust has long been a leader in the area of board diversity, and this is an issue which I am determined to address at the earliest opportunity.\u201d It is the first time since 2000 that Alliance Trust has not had a female board member. John Hylands, a former Standard Life finance director, will stand down from the company\u2019s board at the annual meeting on 6 May, giving the firm an opportunity to appoint a female non-executive director. Garrett-Cox, one of the most high-profile women in the City, who had run Alliance Trust since 2008, left the main board in October and will step down as chief executive of the company\u2019s fund management arm next Friday. She and former chair Forseke lost a battle with Elliott, the trust\u2019s biggest shareholder, which pushed for change at the top and had two of its nominees appointed to the board last spring. The US hedge fund argued that the group had persistently performed worse than other investment trusts, and also criticised Garrett-Cox\u2019s \u00a31.34m pay package. Alliance Trust ended the year with \u00a33.4bn in assets and made a total return of 5.4% last year, outperforming the MSCI World Index\u2019s return of 3.8%. It will pay a dividend of 12.43p for 2015, up 0.4% on 2014. It has been selling off non-core investments to focus on its global equity portfolio. However, annual profits before tax tumbled to \u00a3145m from \u00a3228m. Richard Troue, head of investment analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, welcomed the improvements made to the structure of the board and management team, as well as the \u00a36m cost-cutting programme. He said: \u201cWhile all this has been going on, the investment team has quietly delivered respectable returns ... Some progress has been made bringing the trust back to its roots \u2013 a core, low-cost global equity portfolio that is well diversified, capable of steady growth and a rising income. \u201cShareholders will be pleased to see some outperformance, though one swallow doesn\u2019t make a summer. It\u2019s still early days for the investment team, but they are off to a positive start.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Bob Diamond is expected to look at parts of the African business being put up for sale by Barclays \u2013 which he ran before being forced out during the Libor-rigging crisis \u2013 as he attempts to fulfil his ambition of developing a major banking presence on the continent. The former chief executive of Barclays has already established a banking operation in Africa through Atlas Mara, which is listed on the stock exchange and has a stock market value of about \u00a3250m. He created the business with Ashish Thakkar, a British national now based in Dubai. If Diamond were to make an offer for the Barclays operations through Atlas Mara he would need to raise hundreds of millions of pounds and also find a way to unravel the complex Barclays operations in Africa, which could prove to be extremely difficult. Speculation about Diamond\u2019s interest in buying up some of the operations owned by his former employer have been rife after Barclays confirmed this week that it intended to scale back on the continent as a part of an effort by its new chief executive, Jes Staley, to simplify the business and preserve capital. The Financial Times reported (\u00a3) that Diamond could seek backing from sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East or Asia to support any bid and calculated that the value of the Barclays operations outside South Africa that could fit with the Altas Mara business were valued at \u00a31.5bn. Staley wants to reduce Barclays\u2019 62.3% stake in its African business, which is listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange. Barclays made a big push back into South Africa 10 years ago when it bought a 60% stake in local bank Absa. The business has now become Barclays Africa Group Limited, which is listed on the stock market and holds most of the bank\u2019s operations in Africa. Barclays has admitted it could take two to three years to reduce its presence in Africa, which generates about 20% of the bank\u2019s profits and is prepared to hold a smaller stake in the Johannesburg-listed business. It did not elaborate on its statement from Tuesday when it announced its profits had fallen 8% to \u00a32.1bn in 2015 and warned it was more than halving its dividend for this year and next. Altas Mara, which refused to comment, already has operations in Nigeria, Rwanda, Botswana and is focused on developing on the continent, but not in South Africa where the bulk of Barclays\u2019 operations are based.",

      "bodyText": "Bob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, earned nearly $20m last year \u2013 at a time when the company ran up the biggest losses in its financial history and axed thousands of jobs. The $19.6m (\u00a314m) remuneration bonanza was condemned by the High Pay Centre as another example of a company losing \u201ccontact with reality\u201d when it came to handing out fortunes to top executives. The 20% year-on-year increase in salary, shares and pension payments was revealed in the oil group\u2019s annual report. Plunging crude prices and continuing liabilities emanating from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2011 led BP to report a record 2015 deficit of $6.5bn. The company said Dudley deserved his increase in total remuneration because he and his fellow directors had performed strongly at a difficult time. \u201cDespite the very challenging environment, BP delivered strong operating and safety performance throughout 2015 and responded early and decisively to the steep fall in the oil price. \u201cThe oil price is outside BP\u2019s control, but executives performed strongly in managing the things they could control and for which they are accountable. BP surpassed expectations on most measures and directors\u2019 remuneration reflects this.\u201d The company also pointed out that the 2015 total pay package was swollen by a $3.5m extra pension adjustment to bring payments under Dudley\u2019s US scheme in line with UK financial regulations. Without the pension and retirement elements in the total package, the BP boss\u2019s pay dropped year on year. But Stefan Stern, a director at the High Pay Centre, which monitors executive remuneration, said it was a terrible example to set at a time when 7,000 staff were losing their jobs. \u201cThis is another example of where a company has lost contact with reality \u2013 as well as the English language. Talking about bonuses and performance-related pay at a time of crisis in the industry does not seem like the real world. \u201cThis is why we need employee representatives involved in these kinds of decisions \u2013 as a reality check as to what is acceptable and defensible. Is the boss being given a performance-related reward for getting rid of other people? \u201cWe just don\u2019t know. The sheer complexity of these pay packages is part of the problem. It means that only advisers and remuneration experts really understand what is going on. That can\u2019t be good for transparency.\u201d Executive pay has always been high in the oil and gas sector, with Rex Tillerson, the boss of Exxon Mobil in the US being paid $40m in 2012 while Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden received $26m in 2014. Even then Van Beurden was not the highest paid executive in the FTSE index of leading London companies, with Martin Sorrell of WPP advertising group receiving almost \u00a330m. More recently the energy companies have been plunged into crisis by a crude price which was at $115 per barrel in June 2014 but is now down to $37. BP, like its rivals, has made repeated cutbacks to its staff and capital expenditure in a bid to keep its dividend payments up but the share price has been pummelled. An estimated 70,000 direct and indirect workers connected with the North Sea oil and gas industry have lost their jobs in less than two years.",

      "bodyText": "Car sales in Britain grew strongly last month, marking the best February in more than a decade. New car registrations rose 8.4% in February from a year earlier, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). A total of 83,395 cars were registered, the biggest number for any February since 2004. However, Volkswagen sales continued to fall following last year\u2019s damaging diesel emissions scandal. The German carmaker posted a 13.2% fall in sales to 6,694 last month, and its UK market share slipped to 8% from 10%. But some rivals also lost ground: Toyota sales fell 16%, Vauxhall was down 17.6% and Peugeot lost 11.4%. Other brands owned by VW fared better: Seat was up 35.5%, Skoda rose 28.4% and Audi sales climbed 22%. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cFebruary is typically one of the quietest months of the year, ahead of March\u2019s plate change, but this positive performance is encouraging and puts the sector in a good position for the coming 12 months.\u201d Private buyers drove the increase, with demand up 22.6%, while corporate fleet sales edged lower for a second month, falling 1.4%. Sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles were up by a fifth, outstripping diesel cars (up 5.6%) and petrol vehicles (up 10.7%). Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, noted that \u201ccar sales continue to impress ... bucking the recent trend of largely disappointing UK economic news\u201d. However, he highlighted Brexit fears as a potential concern for the car industry, which could cause fleet operators \u2013 which led car sales growth last year \u2013 to be more cautious in their purchases of new vehicles. Richard Jones, managing director of motor finance provider Black Horse, part of Lloyds Banking Group, was more upbeat. \u201cThese are encouraging figures for the UK automotive industry, continuing a strong start to the year. The increase can be attributed to a combination of further growth in PCP [Personal Contract Purchase] financing, ongoing low interest rates for consumers, and continued high levels of manufacturer subsidisation, driving up the volume of affordable new cars coming into the UK market.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BHS plans to make more than 350 people redundant as the struggling department store chain is forced to make cutbacks. The job losses, to come from its head office and from stores, are one part of the retailer\u2019s turnaround plan and do not include further jobs that could be lost if BHS presses ahead with a threat to close shops. The retailer intends to make 220 people redundant in stores and 150 people in head office. Another 100 roles that had not been filled in BHS\u2019s head office in recent months will also be scrapped, meaning its central operations will shrink by roughy a third. BHS bosses briefed staff about the job losses and the turnaround plan on Friday morning. As well as the job cuts, BHS is threatening to close up to half its stores if landlords do not agree to reduce the rents. BHS has filed a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a type of insolvency proceeding, in an attempt to cut its costs. A CVA allows a company in financial difficulty to reach a deal with creditors, including landlords, about reducing its liabilities. The agreement must be approved by 75% of BHS\u2019s creditors at a meeting scheduled for 23 March. CVAs are legal but controversial in the property industry because they allow a company to walk away from its lease obligations. BHS has split its properties into three categories in the CVA: 77 stores that are unaffected; 47 stores that it claims are viable but need a reduction in rent to \u201cmarket levels\u201d; and 40 that need a substantial reduction in rent to survive. The rent reductions it has proposed are significant. Of the 47 \u201cviable\u201d shops, BHS wants the rent to be cut by 75% on 21 stores and 50% on 26 stores. For the struggling 40 shops it wants to pay just 25% of the rent for the next 10 months while it tries to reach a long-term deal that secures their survival. BHS\u2019s demands on the most at-risk sites are so significant that the survival of all its stores is unlikely. Savills, the property agent, has been brought in to assist KPMG and could dispose of unwanted stores. Sir Philip Green, the retail tycoon, sold BHS for \u00a31 in March to a little-known collection of financiers, lawyers and accountants. Since then concerns about the future of the retailer, which employs more than 10,000 staff, have grown. It emerged the man who led the buyout, Dominic Chappell, is a former bankrupt, while credit insurers have refused to support BHS\u2019s suppliers, meaning the retailer had to pay upfront for stock. Darren Topp, the chief executive of BHS, said he hoped store closures \u201cwill be kept to a minimum\u201d. He added: \u201cAlthough a difficult process to go through, this sets in motion the comprehensive updated turnaround plan that we have identified, and gives British Home Stores a secure financial footing from which to grow and deliver sustainable profitability. \u201cBHS will continue to trade as usual and we thank our staff and customers for their continued support.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The London Stock Exchange said a merger with its Frankfurt rival Deutsche B\u00f6rse would be \u201ccompelling\u201d and is pressing ahead with plans for a \u00a320bn deal, as it reported a big rise in profits and revenues for 2015. The LSE\u2019s annual results confirmed its appeal, showing a 31% rise in profit before tax, stripping out one-off items, to \u00a3643.4m. Including exceptional items, profits climbed to \u00a3336.1m from \u00a3182.1m. Revenues surged 78% to \u00a32.3bn, boosted by the acquisition of US index provider Russell Investments. The LSE said it was on track to sell Russell\u2019s asset management business for \u00a31.15bn in coming months and will use the proceeds to pay off debt. The company raised its dividend for 2015 by 20% to 36p a share. The results did not mention ICE, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, which this week revealed it was pondering a potential counterbid, raising the prospect of a bidding war. The LSE and Deutsche B\u00f6rse said on 23 February that they were in talks to seal a \u201cmerger of equals\u201d under which their key businesses would retain their brand names. The new holding company would be based in London. It is their third attempt at a tie-up in 16 years, and would create the third-largest exchange operator in the world. The LSE\u2019s chief executive, Xavier Rolet, who has run the exchange for the last seven years, on Friday described the planned tie-up as a \u201ccompelling opportunity to strengthen each other in an industry-defining combination, by creating a global market infrastructure group with significant benefits for our customers and shareholders\u201d. The company added that discussions were \u201congoing regarding the other terms and conditions of the potential merger\u201d. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cGiven these results it\u2019s not hard to see why Deutsche B\u00f6rse and ICE are both interested and the fact that London is the centre of the European IPO market, where we\u2019ve seen 72% of the overall IPO activity in the last 12 months. \u201cLondon\u2019s appeal as a centre for private equity and hedge funds makes the overall task of raising capital that much simpler in a very confined geographical location, and while some have cited the upcoming Brexit referendum as a risk to London\u2019s status, it\u2019s not immediately apparent that it would undermine any deal.\u201d He added: \u201cIn particular the LSE\u2019s clearing business LCH.Clearnet is the main draw, though any successful bid may see any suitor offload the stakes in Borsa Italia and the French part of the Clearnet business.\u201d Joshua Raymond, market analyst at online trading firm XTB.com, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a solid year for the LSE. The focus of course now is whether a rival bid emerges from ICE that could spark a bidding war, or if the firms major shareholders remain convinced a tie up with Deutsche B\u00f6rse on the already announced conditions is the best way forward for the trading house.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The competition watchdog is expected to announce next week that it has ditched plans to introduce a wide-ranging price cap on energy bills after fierce lobbying from the big six suppliers. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is also likely to announce that it is lifting a limit on the number of tariffs that companies can offer, scrapping a policy that was introduced by industry regulator Ofgem to provide more clarity for consumers. The CMA has already retreated from other, bolder moves that it threatened to make, including the breakup of large firms such as Centrica and SSE that dominate the wholesale as well as the retail markets. After an 18-month investigation, a raft of remedies will be published by the CMA next Thursday that will affect big energy suppliers but will be seen by some critics as a surrender. The CMA found the big six had overcharged customers by \u00a31.7bn a year between 2009-13, although the industry claimed the figures used were misleading. But the watchdog will argue that its measures \u2013 expected to include a price cap for more vulnerable customers \u2013 will be enough to rebalance the market in favour of the consumer without undermining the industry. Another key remedy from the CMA will be to force suppliers to open up their customer databases to rivals, in a bid to gain more industry-wide transparency and to encourage consumer switching. The measures will remain open to further consultation in time for a final report to be published by the CMA on 25 June, exactly two years after the investigation began into overcharging. The CMA declined to comment, but well-placed industry sources said the overall shape of the remedies was clear and would not involve huge disruption to the sector. Richard Lloyd, executive director of the consumer group Which?, said the CMA should not soften its stance despite recent price cuts by suppliers, because many consumers were still overpaying by up to \u00a3400 a year. \u201cMillions of people are still paying way over the odds for their energy and levels of switching, while increasing, are still woefully low. We would urge all consumers, especially those on a standard tariff with the big six, to switch to a cheaper deal today. \u201cThe stakes are high for the outcome of the energy market investigation and consumers will be expecting action to protect the most vulnerable and bring about fairer energy prices.\u201d One industry source said it was becoming clear there would be no price cap for those on standard variable tariffs, who often paid the most and did not usually switch to different providers. \u201cIt has been clear for some time that the CMA has been gradually retreating in the face of industry complaints and political indifference,\u201d said the source, adding that the atmosphere surrounding the industry had become less hostile since the general election. The Labour party had been promising to impose a price freeze and scrap Ofgem if it had regained power. The shift in mood has been reflected by industry executives. Iain Conn, the Centrica chief executive, said at his company\u2019s annual financial results two weeks ago that he was relaxed about the CMA review despite soaring supply profits, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t really fear the outcome.\u201d Shares in Centrica, the owner of British Gas, rose by 4.5% amid speculation that the CMA has rowed back hugely on some of its bolder ideas. Analysts at banking group Investec put out a \u201cbuy\u201d note to investors on Centrica, saying its prospects looked good. \u201cThe immediate catalyst for the shares will come with the CMA proposed remedies, which should be released this month. We do not expect any \u2018black sky\u2019 scenario from this review.\u201d",
