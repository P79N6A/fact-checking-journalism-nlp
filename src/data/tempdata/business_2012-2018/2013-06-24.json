      "bodyText": "Ireland's prime minister, Enda Kenny, said Irish people were entitled to be angry about revelations that an executive at the firm that almost bankrupted the country boasted he had picked the \u20ac7bn (now \u00a36bn) figure purportedly needed to rescue Anglo Irish Bank \"out of my arse\". Taped phone calls between two senior executives at Anglo Irish have compounded suspicions that bankers lured the then Fianna F\u00e1il-led government during the crash of September 2008 into a costly financial trap. Irish taxpayers were eventually forced to hand over \u20ac30bn to save Anglo Irish Bank from collapse. The huge bailout resulted in the state going cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the EU to save the country from bankruptcy. The audio recordings, obtained by the Irish Independent, are between Anglo's director of capital markets, John Bowe, and Peter Fitzgerald, head of the retail bank, in September 2008. Initially the bank asked Ireland's central bank for \u20ac7bn to prop up its parlous finances following the Irish property crash. Critics of the bailout have insisted Anglo executives always knew the figure would be far higher \u2013 ultimately more than four times higher. On tape Fitzgerald asks Bowe how he arrived at the figure of \u20ac7bn, to which Bowe replies: \"Just as Drummer [the then Anglo Irish Bank CEO David Drumm now in exile and disgrace in Boston] would say, 'picked it out my arse'.\" Speaking in Dublin on Monday afternoon, the taoiseach said he was constrained in what he could say about the Anglo Irish Bank as a result of the continuing Garda Siochana criminal investigation into it. However, Kenny promised that there would be a parliamentary banking inquiry, and said: \"Believe you me, I understand the rage and the anger of so many people who have been affected by all of this.\" He added: \"I have made the point in the D\u00e1il on many occasions that \u2026 I don't have any paperwork to advise me as to the conversations that took place between members of the government and the banks on the run-in to that period.\" The taped conversation between the bankers tends to back up the view that Anglo Irish bankers knew \u20ac7bn would never be enough to save the bank but once they had hoodwinked the Dublin government into providing support the taxpayer would keep picking up the tab. In their exchange, Bowe says: \"The reality is that actually we need more than that. But you know the strategy here is you pull them in, you get them to write a big cheque and they have to keep, they have to support their money, you know.\" On the Irish government getting entrapped by Anglo, Bowe adds: \"If they saw the enormity of it up front \u2026 they might decide they have a choice.

They are heard saying they hope the bank is nationalised so \"we'd keep our jobs\". Bowe, who was approached over the weekend about the 2008 conversations, claimed the remarks were \"off-the-cuff comments\" and denied he was trying to mislead the state. Fitzgerald released a statement through his solicitor saying: \"I am not nor have I ever been aware of a strategy or intention on the part of the Anglo Irish Bank to mislead authorities in relation to the forecasted funding position of Anglo Irish Bank.\" Despite the pair's denials, the taped conversations come at a critical time in the bank's history and will increase the pressure for a full parliamentary inquiry into the bank rescue deal, which cost the taxpayer a further \u20ac30bn after two other debt-ridden banks, the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank, also had to be saved from collapse. Anglo Irish Bank, which was the preferred lender for property speculators and builders, epitomised the rise and ignominious fall of the Celtic Tiger economy.

      "bodyText": "Barclays is to start selling information about 13 million customers' spending habits to other companies, and has admitted it could share the data with government departments and MPs. In letters being sent to customers, it is also outlining what details about them it holds and uses which, it said, \"may include images of you or recordings of your voice\", as well as comments made in interactions with the bank on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. Barclays said it may collect \"location data derived from any mobile device details you have given us\" - suggesting it will be able to pinpoint where in the world a customer is at a particular moment in time. However, the bank assured customers that any data it passed on to third-party companies would be aggregated to show trends, and that individuals would not be identifiable from it. A spokeswoman said there was \"nothing sinister\" going on, and added that it would not be profiteering from customers. Like most companies, Barclays has previously used customer data internally, but it has not shared it with third parties before. It is writing to current and savings account customers to let them know about the changes, which will take effect on 9 October. A leaflet details the \"new ways\" in which Barclays' companies can use customer data, stating: \"We can combine information about you with information about other Barclays customers to create reports which we may share with companies outside Barclays. This information is numerical and not personal, and you will never be identifiable on the basis of it.\" This could include data on how much people spend on different products and services. The bank said the data could be passed to government departments and MPs \u2013 for example, to give them an insight into what was happening in their constituency. In a statement the bank said: \"We only use information in a numerical, anonymised and aggregated way, as is standard practice at many companies. It is not about providing information for sales or marketing use and does not include any personal data.\" It said the move was in accordance with industry guidance from the Information Commissioner's Office and the law. \"Customers are always able to opt out of marketing activity and their personal data will never be passed on to anybody else without their explicit consent,\" it added. The bank said that data relating to where a mobile phone was at a particular time would be used for fraud prevention purposes, and only when a transaction was picked up by its fraud detection systems. It would confirm \"at a country level\" if the customer was in the region where the suspicious transaction had taken place. Customers will be able to opt out of this if they wish. Barclays is the latest in a line of companies to come under scrutiny over the way they use customer information. It emerged recently that Tesco is using data about what Clubcard holders buy in its stores to serve targeted ads to online users of its new movie streaming site, Clubcard TV. Tesco also plans to use its Clubcard data to tackle obesity by offering customers \"tailored suggestions for how they could shop more healthily\". Financial companies have different policies when it comes to the use of people's data. For example, MasterCard states in its global privacy policy that it will \"perform data analyses\" and offers the chance to opt out on its website. Otherwise, people are automatically opted in.",

Barclays said it may collect \"location data derived from any mobile device details you have given us\" - suggesting it will be able to pinpoint where in the world a customer is at a particular moment in time.</p> <p>However, the bank assured customers that any data it passed on to third-party companies would be aggregated to show trends, and that individuals would not be identifiable from it. A spokeswoman said there was \"nothing sinister\" going on, and added that it would not be profiteering from customers. Like most companies, Barclays has previously used customer data internally, but it has not shared it with third parties before. It is writing to current and savings account customers to let them know about the changes, which will take effect on 9 October.</p> <p>A leaflet details the \"new ways\" in which Barclays' companies can use customer data, stating: \"We can combine information about you with information about other Barclays customers to create reports which we may share with companies outside Barclays. This information is numerical and not personal, and you will never be identifiable on the basis of it.\" This could include data on how much people spend on different products and services.</p> <p>The bank said the data could be passed to government departments and MPs \u2013 for example, to give them an insight into what was happening in their constituency.</p> <p>In a statement the bank said: \"We only use information in a numerical, anonymised and aggregated way, as is standard practice at many companies. It is not about providing information for sales or marketing use and does not include any personal data.\"</p> <p>It said the move was in accordance with industry guidance from the Information Commissioner's Office and the law. \"Customers are always able to opt out of marketing activity and their personal data will never be passed on to anybody else without their explicit consent,\" it added.</p> <p>The bank said that data relating to where a mobile phone was at a particular time would be used for fraud prevention purposes, and only when a transaction was picked up by its fraud detection systems. It would confirm \"at a country level\" if the customer was in the region where the suspicious transaction had taken place. Customers will be able to opt out of this if they wish.</p> <p>Barclays is the latest in a line of companies to come under scrutiny over the way they use customer information. It <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jun/08/supermarkets-get-your-data?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">emerged recently that Tesco is using data</a> about what Clubcard holders buy in its stores to serve targeted ads to online users of its new movie streaming site, Clubcard TV. Tesco also plans to use its Clubcard data to tackle obesity by offering customers \"tailored suggestions for how they could shop more healthily\".</p> <p>Financial companies have different policies when it comes to the use of people's data. For example, MasterCard states in its global privacy policy that it will \"perform data analyses\" and offers the chance to opt out on its website. Otherwise, people are automatically opted in.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fears that the Federal Reserve is preparing to remove its stimulus from the US economy coupled with anxiety that China is being gripped by its own credit crunch have sent jitters through global stock and bond markets. The rout hit yields on UK government bonds which hit their highest level since October 2011 in what analysts said was one of the most rapid moves ever witnessed on the market. Yields, which move inversely to price, on 10-year gilts have now risen a full percentage point to edge towards 2.6% in just two months, a rapid pace of change in the potential cost of government borrowing that could in turn increase the price at which companies and households borrow. The FTSE 100, which last month was testing all-time highs, lost another 70 points to sit just above 6000 \u2013 a key level it only moved through at the start of 2013 \u2013 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the US suffered a 200-point loss in the first half hour of trading. Commodity prices, such as copper, were also lower. Yields on US government bonds, known as Treasuries, also hit two-year highs as investors digested recent remarks by the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, that he might begin to slow down the central bank's $85bn (\u00a355.1bn) monthly purchases of bonds which are being used to simulate the economy. Governments in the eurozone, particularly the fragile economies of Spain and Italy, also faced their highest borrowing costs since May as yields rose. Chinese stock markets dropped more than 5%, the biggest fall in three years to reach their lowest close in more than four years, after the People's Bank of China (PBoC) \u2013 the central bank \u2013 appeared to suggest it would not step in to prevent a rise in the rates at which banks borrow from each other. Analysts at Nomura said that \"investors remain concerned over tight liquidity conditions in the banking system\" in China after the PBoC said it would \"contain financial risks with more solid actions\" and \"fine-tune policy when necessary\". The rates which banks borrow from each other in China have jumped to close to 10% and to as much as 25% for some banks \u2013 from just 3% a month ago \u2013 raising concerns about the impact of lending by non-banks in China, known as shadow banks. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \"Fears of a continued cash squeeze in the Chinese banking system has seen European markets continue their soft tone on fears that a dislocation in the banking system will cause further downward revisions in forward expectations for growth over the coming months\". Hewson noted that the warning at the weekend by the Bank for International Settlements, the international central bank organisation, that more stimulus could actually harm fragile economies had also ratted markets. Stephen Cecchetti, head of the BIS monetary and economic department, warned on Sunday: \"Unfortunately, central banks cannot do more without compounding the risks they have already created. Monetary stimulus alone cannot put economies on a path to robust, self-sustaining growth, because the roots of the problem preventing such growth are not monetary.\" But a senior US central banker attempted to fight back against the market reaction saying that the Fed could not be broken in its resolve in easing back from monetary stimulus in the way that the UK had been forced out of the exchange rate mechanism in 1992 by speculative attacks by George Soros. \"But I do believe that big money does organise itself somewhat like feral hogs. If they detect a weakness or a bad scent, they'll go after it,\" Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, told the Financial Times. The Fed had not even started to cut back its purchases of bonds, Fisher said. \"I don't want to go from Wild Turkey to 'Cold Turkey' overnight,\" said Fisher. John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said the potential removal for stimulus by the Fed was the main cause of the upheaval in bond markets but said, though, that a \"bloodbath\" should be averted. Even if US Treasury bond yields rose to 3.5% by the end of the year \u2013 from around 2.5% now \u2013 it would be low by historical standards, Higgins said. In China, concerns about a rapid expansion in lending have dogged Beijing's economic management as consumers seek to maintain their living standards by borrowing cash from these local finance companies rather than main stream banks, although much of the lending can ultimately be traced back to the banking sector. Deutsche Bank has estimated that the among credit extended by non-banks could account for as much as 40% of Chinese GDP. Capital Economics' China analyst, Mark Williams, said investors were factoring in lower growth as the credit squeeze takes effect while the Nomura analysts said the liquidity squeeze was the first real test for China's new leaders, in office for just three months. \"If the new leaders maintain their current approach, we believe it will add downside risk to growth in 2013 but in our opinion this would help reduce systemic financial risks, supporting long-term sustainable growth,\" the Nomura analysts said. China's economy has already slowed in recent months: manufacturing contracted and property construction weakened in May, leading most analysts to say that hopes earlier this year of a bounce in growth have proved misplaced.",

Kazakhmys, like ENRC, is a natural resources company which has emerged from Kazakhstan. It said it would vote its 26% stake in the company in favour of the bid despite previously insisting it was working on securing a higher price. While Kazakhmys still argues the bid undervalues ENRC, it now concedes it sees \"no prospect of obtaining improved terms\". A consortium which includes ENRC's three billionaire founders \u2013 Alexander Machkevitch, Alijan Ibragimov and Patokh Chodiev \u2013 along with the Kazakh government is attempting to acquire the 46% of ENRC it does not already own after the group's share price dropped dramatically over the past two years because of a string of corporate governance rows and scandals that have seen the company investigated by the Serious Fraud Office as well as the UK Listing Authority. Observers believe that the Kazakh government has been particularly keen that a deal to take ENRC private is agreed because it fears the reams of bad publicity about the company's alleged conduct is damaging to Kazakh business in general, as well as to ENRC in particular: the company remains a huge employer in the country. Two of Kazakhmys's largest shareholders, former chairman Vladimir Kim and chief executive Oleg Novachuk, have given their backing to their own board's approval of the ENRC bid.

First, Vodafone appears to have knocked its main rival for the business \u2013 John Malone's Liberty Global \u2013 out of the running before the bidding reached silly prices. In theory, there is still time for Malone to return, but it's not the way to bet. Vodafone has a recommendation from Kabel's board and Liberty would face greater competition hurdles. The second reason is that Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao gave a detailed account of the annual cost savings he hopes to achieve \u2013 some \u20ac300m by the fourth year, he said. The logic is easy to understand: by directly owning cable assets, Vodafone will reduce its reliance on renting fibre capacity from Deutsche Telekom. So far, so good. But it would be hard to claim Vodafone is getting a bargain. Kabel's share price has more than trebled over the past three years and Vodafone's willingness to play at these levels clearly owes much to its realisation that being a mobile-only company is too dangerous to revenues. One can't quibble with the analysis (consumers have embraced bundled deals covering fixed and mobile telephony, TV and broadband) but Vodafone would clearly have been in a better position if it had acted earlier in Europe. Maybe, in practice, that was impossible given the need to fight on so many non-European fronts. But the unanswered question is how much the embrace of cable will end up costing once it is applied across the continent \u2013 either in more acquisitions, or as standalone investment, or as wholesale rental deals. \"We see ourselves not as a mobile business any more, but as a data company,\" says Colao.

Here's a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fears that the Federal Reserve is preparing to remove its stimulus from the US economy coupled with anxiety that China is being gripped by its own credit crunch sent jitters through global stock and bond markets.</p> <p>The rout hit yields on UK government bonds - gilts - which hit their highest level since October 2011 in what analysts said was one of the most rapid moves ever witnessed on the market. Yields, which move inversely to price, on 10 year gilts have now risen a full percentage point to edge towards 2.6% in just two months, a rapid pace of change in the potential cost of government borrowing that could in turn increase the price at which companies and households borrow.</p> <p>The FTSE 100, which only in May was testing all-time highs, lost another 70 points to sit just above 6,000 - a key level it only moved through at the start of 2013 - while the Dow Jones Industrial Index in the US suffered a 200 point loss in the first half an hour of trading. Commodity prices, such as copper, were also lower.</p> <p>Yields on US government bonds, known as Treasuries, also hit two year highs as investors digested recent remarks by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke that he might begin to slow down the central bank\u2019s $85bn monthly purchases of bonds which are being used to simulate the economy.</p> <p>Governments in the eurozone, particularly the fragile economies of Spain and Italy, also faced their highest borrowing costs since May as yields rose on fears about the action of the Fed.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The full story is here:&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/24/fed-fears-china-credit-global-stock-markets\">Fed fears and China credit crunch concerns send jitters through markets</a></strong></p> <p>Otherwise..</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The closing European stock market prices are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/24/eurozone-crisis-bond-yields-spain-greece#block-51c87b95e4b02fd4da954337\">covered at 6.02pm</a></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 The details of China's rout overnight, as its clampdown on shadow banking continues, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/24/eurozone-crisis-bond-yields-spain-greece#block-51c7f5f8e4b0ac0e3b54e8cc\">are in the opening post</a></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 And the latest bond yields are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/24/eurozone-crisis-bond-yields-spain-greece#block-51c87bc4e4b0bc7bf34b0f34\">rounded up at 6.24pm</a></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Secret tapes have added weight to the theory that Anglo Irish bank deliberately misled the Dublin government when it sought financial help, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/24/eurozone-crisis-bond-yields-spain-greece#block-51c849cce4b01331f4d5dc6f\">as explained at 2.29pm</a></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Details of Silvio Berlusconi's conviction, jail term, and ban from public office start <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/24/eurozone-crisis-bond-yields-spain-greece#block-51c866bae4b077c4a8e53618\">at 4.33pm onwards</a></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 And don't miss Richard Fisher, head of the Dallas Federal Reserve, on 'feral hogs' and 'cold turkey' <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/24/eurozone-crisis-bond-yields-spain-greece#block-51c884ebe4b02fd4da95433e\">at 6.57pm</a>.</strong></p> <p>I'll be back tomorrow.

      "bodyText": "Time to stop for the day, after a session dominated by financial news (there was a dearth of eurozone political and social developments today, I'm afraid): My colleagues Jill Treanor and Phillip Inman have filed a full report on today's market action. Here's a flavour: Fears that the Federal Reserve is preparing to remove its stimulus from the US economy coupled with anxiety that China is being gripped by its own credit crunch sent jitters through global stock and bond markets. The rout hit yields on UK government bonds - gilts - which hit their highest level since October 2011 in what analysts said was one of the most rapid moves ever witnessed on the market. Yields, which move inversely to price, on 10 year gilts have now risen a full percentage point to edge towards 2.6% in just two months, a rapid pace of change in the potential cost of government borrowing that could in turn increase the price at which companies and households borrow. The FTSE 100, which only in May was testing all-time highs, lost another 70 points to sit just above 6,000 - a key level it only moved through at the start of 2013 - while the Dow Jones Industrial Index in the US suffered a 200 point loss in the first half an hour of trading. Commodity prices, such as copper, were also lower. Yields on US government bonds, known as Treasuries, also hit two year highs as investors digested recent remarks by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke that he might begin to slow down the central bank\u2019s $85bn monthly purchases of bonds which are being used to simulate the economy. Governments in the eurozone, particularly the fragile economies of Spain and Italy, also faced their highest borrowing costs since May as yields rose on fears about the action of the Fed. The full story is here: Fed fears and China credit crunch concerns send jitters through markets Otherwise.. \u2022 The closing European stock market prices are covered at 6.02pm \u2022 The details of China's rout overnight, as its clampdown on shadow banking continues, are in the opening post \u2022 And the latest bond yields are rounded up at 6.24pm \u2022 Secret tapes have added weight to the theory that Anglo Irish bank deliberately misled the Dublin government when it sought financial help, as explained at 2.29pm \u2022 Details of Silvio Berlusconi's conviction, jail term, and ban from public office start at 4.33pm onwards \u2022 And don't miss Richard Fisher, head of the Dallas Federal Reserve, on 'feral hogs' and 'cold turkey' at 6.57pm. I'll be back tomorrow. Until then, thanks and goodnight. Just time to flag up some remarkable quotes from a (non-voting) member of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, Richard Fisher. Speaking in London tonight, Bank of Dallas president Fisher backed withdrawing the Fed's stimulus package, in a gradual fashion. Fisher (one of the Fed's more hawkish members) declared: I'm not in favour of going from wild turkey to cold turkey over night. But Fisher didn't stop there with the animal analogies. In an interview with the Financial Times he laid into the the \u201cferal hogs\u201d of financial markets, who he said were overreacting to the prospect of the Fed tapering its bond-buying. The Fed won't be knocked off-course by a few days of turbulence, he insisted, as that would encourage speculators to wade in and try to force a u-turn. He's not forgotten the sight of George Soros 'breaking' the Bank of England over two decades ago. Or, as Fisher put it: My personal feeling is that you don\u2019t walk up to a lion and flinch. adding.... I don\u2019t think anyone can break the Fed\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009But I do believe that big money does organise itself somewhat like feral hogs. If they detect a weakness or a bad scent, they\u2019ll go after it. Full interview here: FOMC member warns off \u2018feral hogs\u2019 in markets Our Wall Street correspondent, Dominic Rushe, sums up the action in New York so far: US stock markets fall sharply over Fed comments and China growth concerns Here's a flavour: Gus Faucher, senior economist with PNC Bank, said the US sell-off was an overreaction that was unlikely to continue. \"I think the fundamentals in the US are solid,\" he said. \"The economy is continuing to expand, companies continue to add jobs, demand is holding up, profits continue to improve.\" The sell-off was probably a \"necessary correction\" after major gains in recent months, he said. The fact that Britain's borrowing costs hit a 20-month high today will probably get plenty of attention tonight and tomorrow. But it's really part of a broader theme today, with US Treasury yields rising again as the Fed prepares to slow its monetary easing. And to address a point IfigEusLannuon raised this morning (in the comments), the difference, or 'spread', between different countries is increasing -- showing that weaker countries are being seen as a proportionately bigger risk. In particular, the spread between German yields and those of Spain and Italy have widened. Here's the details of the key 10-year bond yields tonight: \u2022 UK: 2.545%, up 13.8 basis points (ie, 0.138% higher than Friday) \u2022 US: 2.599%, up 8bp \u2022 Germany: 1.8%, up 8bp \u2022 France: 2.449%, up 12bp \u2022 Spain: 5.07%, up 18bp \u2022 Italy: 4.82%, up 24bp \u2022 Portugal: 6.848%, up 39bp \u2022 Greece: 11.6%, up 32bp (all yields are from Tradeweb, via Reuters) US Treasuries are under the closest scrutiny (although Spain also merits attention at &gt;5%). John Higgins of Capital Economics reckons that there's little danger of a 'bloodbath' in the Treasury market, given the Fed's strategy for slowing QE. Higgins explains: The central bank is poised to trim its purchases rather than halt them all of a sudden, and it could well step them up again to prevent any rise in yields that it considers \u201cdisorderly\u201d. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we don\u2019t expect the federal funds rate to be hiked for perhaps a year and a half or so after unconventional easing is first scaled back. The upshot is that while the best days for Treasuries are probably now over, we think there is no need to hit the panic button. After another day of heavy selling, UK gilts have closed at their weakest point in 20 months and the FTSE 100 has closed at its lowest level since early January. And that picture is mirrored across the markets, with all the major indices posting substantial losses and bond yields up -- particularly in the eurozone periphery. As I've been mentioning through the day, the turbulence is being blamed on two factors; fears that China is heading into liquidity crunch as its central bank squeezes shadow banks; and lingering worries about America's quantitative easing stimulus programme being slowed soon. Here's a full round-up of the closing equity markets: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 87 points at 6029, -1.42% \u2022 German DAX: down 96 points at 7692, - 1.24% \u2022 French CAC: down 62 points at 3595, -1.71% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 147 points at 7553, -1.91% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 142 points at 15112, - 0.93% There were only six risers on the FTSE 100, where the list of biggest losers included several mining giants (Vedanta, GlencoreXstrata, Anglo America and Rio Tinto). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explained: Fears of a continued cash squeeze in the Chinese banking system has seen European markets continue their soft tone on fears that a dislocation in the Chinese banking system will cause further downward revisions in forward expectations for Chinese growth over the coming months. This uncertainty combined with rising apprehension over the pace of future asset purchases from the Federal Reserve has seen stock markets pick up where they left off last week and hit fresh lows for 2013, as investors mull over the twin impact of the removal of the unlimited free money that they have become used to over the last three years. It is probably more than anything else that motivated the weekend warning from the Bank of International Settlements that monetary policy was now reaching the limits of its effectiveness and as such central banks should focus on preparing their escape routes. The biggest decliners have once again been the basic resource stocks as concerns over Chinese demand continue to bear down on the mining sector as it continues to hit fresh three year lows on virtually a weekly basis. Here's Reuters' early story on Berlusconi's conviction this afternoon: A Milan court sentenced former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi on Monday to seven years in jail and banned him from public office after finding him guilty of paying for sex with a minor and abusing his powers of office to cover up the affair. The verdict adds to mounting complications facing Prime Minister Enrico Letta, whose fragile left-right coalition government is supported by Berlusconi's centre-right People of Freedom (PDL) party. Berlusconi was found guilty of paying for sex with former teenaged nightclub dancer Karima El Mahroug, better known under her stage name \"Ruby the Heartstealer\", during the now notorious \"bunga bunga\" sex parties at his palatial home near Milan. The panel of three judges, all women, also found the 76 year-old former premier guilty of abuse of office by arranging to have her released from police custody when she was detained in a separate theft case. Berlusconi will not have to serve any jail time unless the sentence is confirmed on appeal. Regarding Berlusconi's conviction and sentencing, this preview piece by Lizzy Davies sets out the background of the trial, and the role of nightclub dancer Karima el-Mahroug, or Ruby Rubacuori (Heartstealer). Breaking news: Silvio Berlusconi has been sentenced to seven years in jail and banned from public office having been found guilty of paying for underage sex, and abuse of office. The sentence, handed down in the last few moments, is actually more severe that the prosecution in the case dubbed Rubygate had sought. However, the former PM is not being led down to the cells... instead the verdict will now go to an appeal. Still, the decision of the three judges raises fresh concerns over the stability of Italys coalition, as Berlusconi's party could potentially withdraw their support for prime minister Enrico Letta. Wall Street has kept falling \u2013 with the Dow now down 220 points, or nearly 1.5%. Marketwatch confirms that the prospect of a liquidity crunch in China is a big worry today, as much as the Fed's plans to slow its asset purchase scheme: U.S. stocks are declining \u201cdue to the concern over the state of the Chinese economy and the implications for the rest of the world,\u201d said Stephen Pope, managing partner at Spotlight Ideas, in an email \u201cI am convinced we have overdone the downside with regard to that [Federal Reserve] story, but now with China we have another excuse to trade with timidity.\u201d And here's confirmation that all the main markets are in the red again: Wall Street is open, and shares are falling in early trading, following today's losses in Europe and the China rout (see 1.13pm for the round-up). The Dow Jones industrial average is down 160 points at 14638, or -1/1%, with similar falls on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq. And with government bond yields still around their earlier highs, the other poing to flag up is that volatility (as tracked by the 'fear index, Vix) is up 11%: The most remarkable story of the day comes from Ireland. Secret tapes released this morning give the clearest signal yet that senior bankers at Anglo Irish Bank deliberately tricked the Irish government into a rescue deal on 2008. The recordings, released by the Irish Independent today, show John Bowe and Peter Fitzgerald discussing their request for \u20ac7bn of emergency funding to keep Anglo Irish running, once the financial crisis struck. The final bill was \u20ac30bn, helping to precipitate Ireland's own bailout. There have long been suspicions that Anglo's management knew the full scale of the crisis and hid it from the Dublin government, who fatefully decided to pick up the bill on the taxpayers' behalf. Our correspondent in Ireland, Henry McDonald, explains: On tape Fitzgerald asks Bowe how did he arrive at the figure of \u20ac7bn to which the latter replies: \"Just as Drummer [the then Anglo Irish Bank CEO David Drumm now in exile and disgrace in Boston] would say, 'picked it out my arse.'\" The conversation also tends to back up the view that Anglo Irish bankers knew that \u20ac7bn would never be enough to save the bank but once they had hoodwinked the Dublin government the taxpayer would keep picking up the tab. In their exchange Bowe says: \"Yeah, and that number is seven, but the reality is that actually we need more than that. But you know the strategy here is you pull them in, you get them to write a big cheque and they have to keep, they have to have support their money, you know.\" Here's Henry's full story: Irish bankers 'hoodwinked' government over bailout, secret recordings show And you can listen to the recordings on the Irish Independent's site (the third recording, 'strategy', is the real humdinger). On the subject of Britain's rising borrowing costs to a 20-month low, maverick Tory MP Douglas Carswell tweets: The yield on UK 10-year bonds is a decent indication of how much it will cost George Osborne to sell new debt to service the deficit. Last month, 10-year gilts were yielding just 1.6%. They've risen sharply since, but today's rise to 2.5% is still low on historic terms. 10-year gilts were yielding 5% in July 2008, shortly before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, as this graph shows: The big question, though, is how much will they rise in the month ahead? A return to higher bond yields might be welcomed as a sign that normality is returning to the markets, yet it could inflame the crisis by 1) forcing sizeable losses on investors who bought bonds when yields were at record lows (and thus prices at record highs). 2) pushing up sovereign borrowing costs - potentially a problem for countries running sizeable deficits (the UK is on track to borrow some \u00a3120bn this year, or around 7.4% of GDP). The selloff in Europe's stock markets is accelerating, with the FTSE 100 now down 85 points at 6030, its lowest level since early January. And with bonds falling, Britain's borrowing costs are at their highest level since October 2011. Other European markets are also falling deeper into the red, with Spain's IBEX and France's CAC both down by over 2%. And Wall Street is also expected to join the selloff in a couple of hours, with the Dow Jones expected to shed 150 points as US traders react to China's tumbling stock market (as explained this morning, Chinese indices suffered their worst day's trading in nearly four years as the clampdown on its shadow banking sector continues). Fawad Razaqzada, market strategist at GFT Markets, said China's liquidity squeeze came as investors were still digesting the prospect of the Federal Reserve winding down its stimulus programme. Razaqzada explained: Surging interbank lending rates in China are pointing to a liquidity squeeze and there's little apparent sign of intervention by government to ease the situation. As a result the Shanghai composite is off by over 5% and markets elsewhere in the region are telling a similar tale... This does mean that just as traders were coming to terms with the end of QE, there's another significant factor they need to be pricing into the market, too. And that 'pricing in' process has seen government bonds under the cosh again, as nerves stalk the trading floors Prices are falling across the board and driving up interest rates -- both for riskier eurozone members and 'safe-haven' countries such as the US. UK gilts are falling in line with the market, which pushes Britain's borrowing cost to a 20-month high of 2.55% (for 10-years). Here's the latest 10-year bond yields (the classic measure of borrowing costs): \u2022 Spain: 5.03%, up 14 basis points (14bp) [from 4.89% on Friday] \u2022 Italy: 4.79%, up 20bp \u2022 Greece: 11.62%, up 30bp \u2022 US: 2.63%, up 12bp \u2022 UK: 2.55%, up 14bp \u2022 France: 2.53%, up 20bp \u2022 Germany: 1.82%, up 10bp Here's a selection of instant reaction: Also in Greece, employees of its ERT state broadcaster are continuing their sit-in at its Athens HQ. Despite repeated demands for them to exit the building, the occuption is entering its 14th day, with increasingly weary-looking staff continuing to broadcast. The Greek finance ministry called on workers to leave \"to allow for the unhindered and immediate implementation\" of the Council of State's decision last (that a limited service should be restored, but ERT should still close). Over in Greece, the two parties which still make up the country's coalition are discussing a cabinet reshuffle today. Following the exit of Democratic Left on Friday, prime minister Antonis Samaras and Evangelos Venizeloz of Pasok must now reshape their government. Kathimerini has mopped up the latest chatter, including the suggestion that Venizelos might become foreign minister (our correspondent Helena Smith explained last week that the Pasok leader wanted his party to have more prominence in the government: Here's the latest: According to sources, the ratio of New Democracy to PASOK ministers in the new cabinet will be 2:1. There were rumors that Venizelos may assume the post of foreign minister, currently held by Dimitris Avramopoulos, as well as the position of deputy prime minister. Among those expected to keep their posts are Development Minister Costis Hatzidakis, Public Order Minister Nikos Dendias, Tourism Minister Olga Kefaloyianni and Education Minister Constantinos Arvanitopoulos. Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras is also expected to remain in place. There's no immediate risk of the government collapsing. Samaras still controls 153 of the 300 seats in parliament, and Dem. Left could still support him in key votes despite quitting the coalition. The copper price has dropped to a new three-year low this morning. Fears over China's slowing economy are being blamed, along with the US dollar strengthening again as investors pull money out of bonds and shares. Having fallen last week, copper dropped again this morning to as low as $6,613. China mops up around 40% of world copper output, so the new push against risky lending in its shadow banking sector is also hitting the metal. From the WSJ: \u201cThe outlook for Chinese demand in the short term is negative,\u201d Phillip Futures Investment Analyst Joyce Liu said, adding that tight liquidity will mean higher costs for companies importing copper into China. Here's a graph showing how the FTSE 100 has now shed all its gains through the year after today's drop, and a list of the top fallers on the index. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares has dropped to its lowest level since January, as the slump in China's stock market overnight hits Europe's stock markets. After a slow start, the main European indices are all falling again, adding to last week's hefty losses. The Footsie fell as low as 6057, a drop of 58 points. Spain's IBEX is the worse performer, down 1.5%. The Chinese benchmark index, the CSI 300, is now in a 'bear market' -- its 6.3% tumble this morning means its more than 20% off its peak. The China selloff (sparked by the clampdown on its shadow banking - see 8.39am) and the Federal Reserve's plan to turn the stimulus tap down are proving a nasty cocktail for the markets. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said the worries over the Fed were being \"compounded\" by the liquidity sqeeze in China and fears over its domestic economy, adding: One thing this sell-off has demonstrated is how much more quickly markets tend to correct, even after a sharp ascent like that from mid-April. Commodity prices are also slding again, pushing the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil below $100/barrel. Gold is also down again, losing another $15 to $1,281 per ounce. There's no real let-up in the market gloom -- as Aurelija Augulyte of Nordea Markets points out: Encouraging economic data from Germany - where business morale has risen for the second month in a row. The IFO index rose to 105.9, from 105.7 in May, with German companies saying they are more confident of an economic revival later this year. No signs of full-blown euphoria, just a steady improvement in business confidence. The recent huge flooding in parts of Germany also didn't cause any alarm, it seems. Dr J\u00f6rg Zeuner of KFW summed it up: Companies remained confident in June and continue to expect a good domestic economy. The devastating floods in Southern and Eastern Germany hardly influenced this outlook. That's a good signal and confirms our expectations of a moderate economic revival in the second half. Risks in the international environment continue, such as recently the fierce reaction of investors to the monetary policy comments from the U.S. central bank. Kit Juckes, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's top currency expert, reckons that the US Federal Reserve may attempt to stop the government bond selloff in the next few days - having lit the touchpaper last week. He writes: At some pont this week (and I'm betting it is before Wednesday evening), the Fed will make sufficiently clear its concerns about market turmoil to stop the relentless rise in Treasury yields. Of course, now that the genie has been let out of the bottle and the great big carry bubble has been burst, we won't go back to the halcyon days before taper entered the dictionary, but we will get a little bit of relief. Over in Milan, the underage sex case brought against Silvio Berlusconi is about to be resolved -- in a development that could have serious political implications. The judges hearing the case against the former Italian prime minister, who still has considerable political influence, just retired to consider their verdict. The allegations against Berlusconi revolve around 'Ruby the heart stealer', a nightclub dancer. If convicted, the two-time PM could be jailed for four years. Italy's treacle-slow political system means that Berlusconi would not be immediately incarcerated even if found guilty -- he could make two appeals first. But as my colleague Lizzy Davies explains, the case has a political dimension \u2013 especially given Berlusconi's other legal problems: There are concerns...that the real effect of a guilty verdict could be on the country's unstable political landscape and Enrico Letta's government, which almost every day sees fresh bickering between Berlusconi's People of Freedom party (PdL) and the centre-left Democratic party (PD). For the moment, Berlusconi is insisting that he supports the government regardless of his legal problems. But there is anger among the ranks of the PdL, and some party figures would like to see their leader withdraw support from the coalition if his \"persecution\" by the courts continues \u2013 a move that would trigger fresh elections. Walston said the risk of immediate political instability as a result of the Ruby trial was small. A far bigger concern for Berlusconi and his allies is a tax fraud case in which he has already exhausted one appeal and is approaching a definitive ruling by the court of cassation, Italy's supreme court. If that conviction is upheld, a four-year jail sentence \u2013 and, crucially, a five-year ban on public office \u2013 would come into force. Here's Lizzy's full story on the case: Silvio Berlusconi's underage sex trial verdict expected Britain's government debt is also falling this morning, pushing up the yield on UK gilts. The 10-year version is now trading at a yield (interest rate) of 2.45%. It's a small move - up from 2.41% on Friday night. But the yield has been climbing higher for the last seven weeks - at the start of May, 10-year gilts were yielding just 1.62%.... Another sign of jitters this morning -- the Euro STOXX 50 Volatility index has hit a four-month high in early trading. China's stock market has suffered its biggest daily fall in almost four years, as the crackdown on its shadow banking system continues. The benchmark CSI300 index slumped by 6.3%, its biggest daily fall since 31 August 2009. Financial stocks were particularly badly hit. Stocks tumbled after China's central bank signalled that its crackdown on the country's shadow banking sector would continue, fanning fears of a credit crunch. The People's Bank of China stated this morning that liquidity in the country's financial system was \"reasonable\" -- which was taken a signal that it would maintain the liquidity squeeze that began last week. PBOC also declared that China's commercial banks need to 'improve' the way they manage liquidity and control risks. In other words -- help us stabilise the market by cleaning up your balance sheets. The PBOC appears to be determined to clamp down on riskier areas of banking, such as underground lending and speculation, which increase leverage in the Chinese financial market \u2013 at a time when the wider economy is strugglng. Reuters has more details: \"It's much easier to borrow money today, but costs remain high. Our business is apparently affected, but mainly on side business, such as wealth management,\" said a trader at a mid-sized commercial bank in Shanghai. \"Maybe this is what the central bank hopes as the government is calling for more money to be used for real economy.\" On a positive note \u2013 the interest rate China's banks charge to lend money to each other fell this morning. As this graph shows, Spain's borrowing costs hit a near three-month high this morning, but are still lower than a year ago when a bailout looks likely: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the eurozone, the financial world and the global economy. The government bond sell-off which began last week continues in earnest this Monday morning, putting renewed presure on Spain and Italy Sovereign debt is falling across the board in early trading, pushing up the borrowing costs of countries around the world. And some of the eurozone's weaker members are being hit hard. As I type, Spain's 10-year bond yield just hit 5% for the first time since the start of April, up from 4.88% on Friday. Italy's debt is also being pummelled, driving its 10-year yield up to 4.71% (from 4.58%). These bond yields are still some distance away from the danger zone (typically 7% is seen as the level where countries risk being locked out of the markets). But the speed of the reversal is a concern, as the markets remain spooked by the prospect of the US Federal Reserve withdrawing its stimulus measures. It looks like we're in for a rough ride for a while. As Ian WIlliams of Peel Hunt put it: The transition towards a more growth-driven phase of market performance is likely to remain bumpy though the summer as the long awaited improvement in corporate earnings has been slow to emerge. US Treasuries (America's government debt) is also sliding again this morning, pushing up its own 10-year bond yields by another 10 basis points (0.1%) to 2.61%. Meanwhile, over in China, fears over the ongoing liquidity squeeze in its banking system have sent its stock markets tumbling, in their biggest daily fall in four years (more on this shortly). Plenty to watch in the markets today..... While in the political sphere, I'll be monitoring events in Athens where the ruling coalition is down to just two parties after Democratic Left quit the government last Friday....",

Taped phone calls between two senior executives at Anglo Irish have compounded suspicions in the Republic that bankers lured the then Fianna F\u00e1il led government during the crash of September 2008 into a costly financial trap by saving the debt-stricken bank with public money. In the end the Irish taxpayer was forced to hand over \u20ac30bn to save Anglo Irish Bank from collapse and resulted in the state going cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the EU to save the country from national bankruptcy.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vodafone has agreed to buy Germany's biggest cable company for \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.6bn) in a deal that sees the UK mobile phone firm make its first move into consumer broadband and television. The deal has been approved by the board of Kabel Deutschland but could become the subject of a bidding war with US firm Liberty Global, which owns Germany's second biggest cable firm UnityMedia. Vodafone has offered \u20ac87 a share, valuing the business at \u20ac7.7bn, an increase on an informal offer of \u20ac82 a share made two weeks earlier. It will also take on the company's debt of \u00a32bn. Chief executive Vittorio Colao said: \"German consumer and business demand for fast broadband and data services continues to grow substantially as customers increasingly access TV, fixed and mobile broadband services from multiple devices.\" He added that the deal is \"consistent with Vodafone's broader strategy of providing unified communications services.\" The company has been keen to move into the cable market and wants to tap into \"quad play\", offering TV, broadband, telephone and mobile. Colao said the price was \"full and fair\" believing the company could make cost savings of \u20ac300m a year, eventually saving \u20ac3bn. The Kabel Deutschland management team would remain in place to run the fixed line business. The company has 8.5 million customers and its cables pass 15.3m German homes. If the deal goes through, it would be one of the biggest in the telecoms industry in several years and comes 13 years after Vodafone's first foray into Germany, when it bought mobile phone network Mannesmann for \u00a3101bn. The company will be hoping for better luck with this bid after a move to merge with a Greek rival fell through, and an expansion into Burma ended due to high start-up costs. It comes a month after Vodafone signed a rental agreement with Deutsche Telekom for its cable capacity, and a year after Vodafone's first fixed-line takeover of business and wholesale provider Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide last year for \u00a31bn. However, Colao said the Deutsche Telekom deal, which passes many of the same homes as the Kabel Deutschland cables, would remain in place. He said: \"It won't affect the wholesale agreement. Deutsche Telekom will remain an important deal with us and we will remain important partners with Deutsche Telekom.\" Industry analysts have suggested this deal could be followed by bigger acquisitions as the telecoms giant looks to secure its own future and risk any possible takeover. However, Vodafone played down any future takeovers. Colao said: \"I wouldn't have any read across this deal and clearly every situation is different. The intention is to reach homes and offices and I would not comment on any other market. Its US partner, Verizon, has said it wants to buy Vodafone's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless \u2013 worth around $130bn\u2013 which could leave Vodafone vulnerable to a takeover. A $100bn offer was rejected by Vodafone two months ago. The Kabel Deutschland chief executive, Adrian von Hammerstein, said: \"Together, we have the opportunity to become Germany's leading telecommunications and television provider and to create what for the German market is a unique, winning combination of fixed line and mobile communications.\" The company's revenues hit \u20ac1.83bn in the year to the end of March, with pretax profits of \u20ac226m.",

But here was the kicker: \u201cBeijing prefers to use reforms rather than stimulus to sustain growth. While reforms can boost long-term growth prospects, they will have a limited impact in the short term.\u201d As such, HSBC expected weaker growth in the next two years.</p> <p>How much weaker? Well they revised down their 2013 projection for China\u2019s GDP growth from 8.2% to 7.4%, and for 2014 from 8.4% to 7.4% as well.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now, 7.4% still sounds like boomtown, but let\u2019s give it some context:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b75f0868-54ce-4925-a6d9-66f509f8d764\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/23/1371982942074/ed1ae246-7209-4f49-b477-d59f4d78bc5d-460x252.jpeg\" alt=\"China's annual GDP growth\" width=\"460\" height=\"252\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">China's annual GDP growth Photograph: /IMF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>China hasn\u2019t had three consecutive years of less than 8% growth in the past 15 years.

Again, some context:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4cec12bb-5dcf-4e2d-a613-ac4d903e8389\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/23/1371982999021/feeb2f6a-9c65-4b3a-aadf-370f0f0346bf-460x245.jpeg\" alt=\"China's annual growth of industrial output\" width=\"460\" height=\"245\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">China's annual growth of industrial output Photograph: Trading economics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only time it has been worse than this in the past decade was during the GFC \u2013 after which the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_stimulus_program\">Chinese government unleashed a stimulus program worth 4tn yuan</a> (about US$586bn).</p> <p>This time round, that\u2019s not happening. They want the economy to actually grow on its own.</p> <p>The problem is China, somewhat like the US prior to the GFC, has a credit bubble that looks set to burst. The Chinese central bank \u2013 the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) \u2013 tried to give the bubble a slight prick by tightening monetary policy and putting the screws on borrowing among China\u2019s banks.</p> <p>That caused the rate at which their banks lend to each other to triple, and set off a fair bit of selling in world financial markets.

But it seems to be a sign of things to come. The Chinese government appears more interested in stable growth than a boom fuelled by either government stimulus or unsafe bank lending.</p> <p>So if we can\u2019t count on China\u2019s boom are we in trouble?</p> <p>Well, perhaps. We already know <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/grogonomics/2013/jun/11/australia-beware-normality-beckons-treasury\">mining investment has peaked</a> but should stay high, and exports should continue to grow.

The tremors started in America and flowed to China, and in some ways the news out of both was the same. In essence it boiled down to both nations saying that the government could not carry the economy forever. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, let it be known that if the US economy improves and if the unemployment rate goes below 7% it will start to think about easing its monetary policy by cutting back on buying $85bn worth of bonds each month. He also noted that later the Federal Reserve might think about raising interest rates. Much later \u2013 like perhaps two years' time! That such news resulted in the US dollar appreciating against all currencies gives you an indicator of how skittish markets can be. This was an announcement of things that might happen if things keep going well. So you can imagine how edgy they would get when news comes out about things happening now \u2013 bad things.
