      "bodyText": "As the Ebola epidemic continues to rage in west Africa, with more than 3,000 dead and infections doubling every few weeks, the first confirmed case in the US last week stepped up global fears over the rapid spread of the incurable virus. But behind the gruesome headlines, the scale of the outbreak has been raising hopes that it could focus minds at the world's biggest pharmaceutical groups, boosting research on other devastating tropical diseases that have been neglected for years by the drugs makers. There are already an estimated 12 million Americans suffering from life-threatening or debilitating infections such as Chagas disease, dengue fever or West Nile virus. \"Ebola helps us realise we are a global planet: the health of one region affects the rest of us,\" says Julie Jacobson, senior programme officer for infectious diseases at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Mike Turner, head of infection and immunobiology at the Wellcome Trust, says that \"almost certainly, Ebola will increase the visibility\" of tropical diseases. The worst Ebola outbreak in history has infected more than 6,500 people, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the outbreak an international health emergency, warning that the deadly virus could infect up to 20,000 people by November. When last week a man was hospitalised with the disease in Dallas, Texas, it was the first case diagnosed outside Africa. GlaxoSmithKline has started making 10,000 doses of its experimental Ebola vaccine \u2013 the most advanced product around \u2013 and could supply it to the WHO for an emergency vaccination programme early next year, assuming clinical trials go well. The vaccine has been rushed into tests on healthy human volunteers in the UK and US. Other Ebola vaccines in development, from Johnson &amp; Johnson's Crucell division and NewLink Genetics, are close to entering the laboratory. ZMapp, made by a San Diego-based company, is the most advanced of the experimental treatments and has cured some patients, including the British nurse Will Pooley, but stocks have now run out. ZMapp's development was supported by the US military's main biodefence research facility, amid fears that the virus could be turned into a biological weapon. But until now Ebola, which had sporadic, smaller outbreaks in the past, was not a priority: it did not feature on the WHO's list of 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) drawn up in 2012. Together those 17, which include tuberculosis, rabies, leprosy, river blindness, sleeping sickness and parasitic worm infections, affect more than 1.4 billion of the world's poorest people across Africa, Asia and Latin America. The publication of the list in 2012 saw the first concerted effort to tackle those diseases, when 13 pharma companies teamed up with the WHO and the Gates foundation in a pledge known as the London declaration to control or eradicate 10 of the diseases by 2020. The End Neglected Tropical Diseases Act introduced in US Congress this year calls for the United States Agency of International Development to expand its focus on tropical diseases and step up coordinated international efforts. Research funding for neglected tropical diseases rose 3% to $3.2bn in 2012 after years of decline, according to a survey funded by the Gates foundation. But pharmaceuticals firms contributed just $527m \u2013 a fraction of total spending on research and development of $130bn. Most of the money spent on tropical diseases \u2013 two-thirds of it \u2013 comes from governments. A study published in the Lancet last year showed that of the 336 new drugs developed between 2000 and 2011, only four were for neglected diseases (three for malaria and one for diarrhoeal diseases), and of 150,000 trials registered in late 2011, only 1% tackled NTDs. Ebola could change all that. Deutsche Bank analyst Mark Clark says: \"Ebola could be the issue that sends the whole thing snowballing. You are going to get more industry engagement. The signs were already positive after the London Declaration on NTDs in 2012.\" Jacobson reckons the 2020 goals are \"ambitious on all fronts\" but \"each one is attainable\", even though a funding gap of $1.5bn remains. \"Unfortunately, it's always a good thing for a disease to make it to an industrialised country,\" she says. \"A lot of tropical diseases have been invisible to the world.\" A progress report from signatories of the London declaration earlier this year highlighted early successes: Colombia became the first country to verify the elimination of river blindness (followed by Ecuador); Nigeria, Niger and Ivory Coast were certified as free of Guinea worm; and Morocco has been declared clear of blinding trachoma. Within the industry, GlaxoSmithKline, Britain's biggest drugmaker, and France's Sanofi are investing the most, each putting more than $100m a year into tropical disease research, according to Deutsche Bank. They are followed by Switzerland's Novartis, which plays a key role in the supply of antimalarial drugs in Africa, its Swiss rival Roche and Germany's Bayer. By contrast, most US pharmaceuticals firms regard tropical diseases as a philanthropic venture and restrict themselves to donating off-patent drugs such as anti-worm tablets, Clark says. He added: \"To the extent that these diseases are starting to appear in the US, this will put the issue much more firmly on [US companies'] radar.\" Chikungunya has recently joined a growing list of mostly hidden diseases that have taken up residence in the US (mainly on the Gulf coast), according to a study in the Lancet published last month. There is no cure for the mosquito-borne virus, which causes fever and severe joint pain. Once it is established, says Turner, it is extremely difficult to eradicate. Manhattan is now regularly sprayed from the air with pesticide to counter another mosquito-borne disease, West Nile virus, which is potentially fatal. Chagas, which can cause heart damage and can be cured in its early stages, affects an estimated 300,000 Americans. Two parasitic worm infections found widely in the US affect the brain: cysticercosis, which has emerged as a significant cause of epilepsy, and toxocariasis. Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, refers to these illnesses as the \"diseases of extreme poverty and of conflict or post-conflict settings\". Their rapid spread can be partly attributed to lack of sanitation, health infrastructure and clean drinking water. \"While there won't be an Ebola epidemic in the US, I am very concerned about the neglected tropical diseases now affecting the US Gulf coast,\" Hotez says. \"They're widespread, but because they occur predominantly among Americans who live in extreme poverty, very few people know about them.\" Andrew Hollingsworth, policy manager of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, says: \"Unfortunately, the standard economic model for drug development, in which industry takes all of the risk in R&amp;D and gets a return on investment from successful products, does not work for diseases that primarily impact low-income countries and developing healthcare systems.\" As a result, collaborations with academia and government now account for the bulk (86%) of research efforts. Many companies have formed partnerships with the Gates foundation, which has supported infectious disease research worth tens of billions of dollars and recently pledged $50m to fight Ebola, its largest emergency donation so far. Turner says two commissions are looking at alternative financial models, one created by Chatham House and a commission on antimicrobial resistance which looks at the growing problem of drug-resistant infections and is led by economist Jim O'Neill (and backed by the Department of Health, HM Treasury and the Wellcome Trust). One idea is that governments could underpin the economic cost of drug development by committing early to buy the first 2m doses of a new vaccine, for example. But most drugs for tropical diseases are either donated by pharma firms or sold at not-for-profit prices. The Deutsche Bank analysts highlight the resurgence of the industry's engagement through WHO donations, flexible pricing and patent policies, collaborative R&amp;D and investments in healthcare infrastructure. \"We see this as both 'doing the right thing' and a strategic investment in the customers of tomorrow, given that the tropics are home to over 40% of the world's population,\" they write. \"Economic growth in the decades ahead will inevitably see many of these nations becoming increasingly important commercially to the pharma industry.\" New vaccines One is three people globally are at risk of malaria and there are 3,000 malaria cases in the UK every year, all imported. GSK is developing a malaria vaccine that could be ready late next year and is expected to be sold on a not-for-profit basis. Its success rate was only about 30% in infants but better in toddlers, although final clinical results and data on the effect of a booster are still due. But other tropical diseases are much less well known. Dengue fever (also known as breakbone fever), which kills an estimated 20,000 people each year, including many children, has become the fastest-growing tropical disease globally. French drugmaker Sanofi has developed a vaccine with a 60% success rate that will be on the market next year after two decades of research. Mexico, Brazil and Colombia could be the first to market the vaccine. Unlike treatments for many other tropical diseases it is expected to become a commercial blockbuster, with annual sales of more than \u20ac1bn.",

One idea is that governments could underpin the economic cost of drug development by committing early to buy the first 2m doses of a new vaccine, for example.</p> <p>But most drugs for tropical diseases are either donated by pharma firms or sold at not-for-profit prices. The Deutsche Bank analysts highlight the resurgence of the industry's engagement through WHO donations, flexible pricing and patent policies, collaborative R&amp;D and investments in healthcare infrastructure.</p> <p>\"We see this as both 'doing the right thing' and a strategic investment in the customers of tomorrow, given that the tropics are home to over 40% of the world's population,\" they write. \"Economic growth in the decades ahead will inevitably see many of these nations becoming increasingly important commercially to the pharma industry.\"</p> <h2>New vaccines</h2> <p>One is three people globally are at risk of malaria and there are 3,000 malaria cases in the UK every year, all imported. GSK is developing a malaria vaccine that could be ready late next year and is expected to be sold on a not-for-profit basis. Its success rate was only about 30% in infants but better in toddlers, although final clinical results and data on the effect of a booster are still due.</p> <p>But other tropical diseases are much less well known. Dengue fever (also known as breakbone fever), which kills an estimated 20,000 people each year, including many children, has become the fastest-growing tropical disease globally. French drugmaker Sanofi has developed a vaccine with a 60% success rate that will be on the market next year after two decades of research. Mexico, Brazil and Colombia could be the first to market the vaccine.</p> <p>Unlike treatments for many other tropical diseases it is expected to become a commercial blockbuster, with annual sales of more than \u20ac1bn.</p>",

The former Uppingham schoolboy has led a charmed existence, especially since his clairvoyant move into flogging mobile phones at the end of the 1980s.

Anyway, a procedural hearing set for Monday will essentially set a timetable for the full case, and discuss costs. But where it could become interesting is when three further witness statements that the LIA has submitted become available over the course of this week's hearing. They should provide added colour to a case that has already included: a solicitor on secondment to the LIA alerting the investment fund to the charges it was paying, as well as Goldman's executive director in charge of Libyan investments, Youssef Kabbaj, being summoned to the LIA's office to explain the fees, only to be thrown out of the building by the director.

      "bodyText": "Cabinet ministers evoke a wide variety of judgments, but I cannot recall anything quite so caustic as that of the celebrated journalist Bernard Levin, on the foreign secretary, Selwyn Lloyd, in 1959. In a review in the Spectator of a book about the early 19th century statesman Lord Castlereagh, Levin wrote: \"The real mystery, in fact, is not why Castlereagh cut his throat, but why Mr Selwyn Lloyd has not.\" Not long after that, Lloyd was elevated to the chancellorship by Harold Macmillan. My dissatisfaction with the chancellorship of George Osborne has not diminished with time, but even I should find it a little extreme to suggest that he fall on his sword. Nor do I think any longer that that great fan of Macmillan, David Cameron, should sack him. No, I think Osborne should remain in place until he faces the verdict of the electorate: a verdict that ought to be damning. It is laughable that Osborne should, apparently, have chosen to fight the Labour party on the issue that they are not being as tough on \"the deficit\" as he is. For a start, he has always been obsessed with the wrong deficit. The principal macroeconomic problem facing the British economy is the size of its balance of payments deficit. The budget deficit, so far from being a problem, was from 2010 onwards part of the solution: it stopped the rot when the economy was in a nosedive in 2009. That it is still with us, albeit at a lower level, is due to the failure of Osborne's strategy, which was to eliminate the deficit within this parliament \u2013 something, mercifully, he is nowhere near to achieving. His opponent Ed Balls \u2013 a much maligned man, who may yet live to see off Mr Osborne \u2013 was absolutely right to criticise the strategy of accelerated deficit reduction when the economy was just emerging from recession in the summer of 2010. So far from boosting confidence and animal spirits with his deflationary budget of June 2010, Osborne depressed them. To all intents and purposes the economy did indeed \"flatline\" for almost three years. The current recovery, while welcome, has been needlessly delayed, and still leaves the economy up to 20% below the level of activity that could have been predicted from historical trends, if policy had not been so deflationary. From the start, Osborne's public statements were disingenuous. We were told that the British economy was in as desperate a situation as Greece; the truth was that the Greek government did not know where the next month's loans were coming from, whereas money was pouring into London and the average maturity on government stock was 14 years. There is no sign of panic in the gilt market: the UK's budget deficit is not a matter of great concern \u2013 except, that is, to a government that wishes to play the issue up for electoral reasons, and a media, including the BBC, that has bought into \"the deficit\" as a story. It should by now be perfectly obvious to everyone that the Tory party is using the deficit scare as the justification for a rightwing agenda that involves shrinking the state at the expense of the most vulnerable in society. One used to have to point this out: but, to judge from the speeches and policy announcements from the prime minister and chancellor at their party conference in Birmingham last week, they now as good as proclaim that they are cutting the benefits of the unemployed and the working poor so that they can cut taxes for the better off. Their shamelessness is quite remarkable. The Tories got a strikingly good press last week, not least because of the contrast with what was generally perceived to be a lacklustre performance by Labour leader Ed Miliband the previous week. But the truth is that the Tories are on the run: on the run from Ukip. Even though the quality of the defectors to Ukip is nowhere near that of the people Labour lost in the 1980s to the SDP, nevertheless there is an obvious danger that there will be sufficient disruption to ruin the Conservatives' chances. In their desperation, the prime minister and chancellor have managed to expose themselves to the charge they normally lay at Labour's door: irresponsible promises that the Institute for Fiscal Studies and other independent sources say do not add up. Consider: they are making a big thing about increased national security but plan to eat further into the already strapped defence and police budgets. It is not just the poor they plan to milk: it is essential services. Meanwhile, by making it clear last week that the European Union was not close to his heart, the prime minister seems to be following the chancellor in buttering up his Eurosceptic wing. This is not going down well with British business. North-west of the Birmingham conference, the importance of the European Regional Development Fund was highlighted at a lively conference I attended in Wolverhampton on business opportunities in the West Midlands. What one sees in the West Midlands is a healthy manufacturing sector that is far from the moribund image often painted. The problem is that this government is waking up rather late in its term of office to the infrastructure problems that hinder the private sector, as any visitor to the Midlands soon becomes aware. And what would make the problems even worse would be an exit from the European Union.",

      "bodyText": "As they scramble to maintain market share, the big four British grocers can take comfort from the fact that at least they are not alone. The global supermarket industry has its share of epic competitive scraps, too. In Europe alone, the discounters that have wrought havoc for Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury's have an even more powerful grip on the industry. While Aldi and Lidl control around 8% of the UK market, according to figures from market research group Kantar the share controlled by discounters in France is 10% and in Germany \u2013 home of Aldi and Lidl \u2013 it is 37%. In the UK, two-thirds of the market is controlled by four players; this is the same as in Germany, while in France 56% of the market is controlled by the top four and in Spain just under 50%. A look at these markets, plus some of the biggest outside Europe, shows that every territory poses challenges for big grocers. Germany The British story of stellar growth for discounters and pain inflicted on established chains is well-known in Germany. \"German supermarkets fought that same battle two decades ago\", said Matthias Queck, a Frankfurt-based analyst for Planet Retail. It was a skirmish the traditional chains fought with limited success: Aldi and Lidl nowadays have nearly 40% of the market. \"What we're seeing in Britain may just be the pangs of a market adjusting its prices and the power balance between supermarkets and discounters to what we are used to seeing in continental Europe,\" he added. But while \"quality\" supermarkets such as Edeka and Rewe may still be smarting, they are travelling in a very different direction from the one chosen by their British equivalents. \"If anything, they have for the past few years been trying to shake off the cheap, 'discount' image and convince customers that paying a little bit extra is worth it,\" said Queck. As in the UK, discounters and supermarkets in Germany are faced with shoppers who are less and less willing to drive out of town for their weekly shop, and more likely to do small, frequent trips in urban areas. In recent years, the trend has led to a revival in big cities like Hamburg and Berlin of the traditional Tante Emma L\u00e4den or corner shops, which have been able to be much more flexible in reacting to trends or food scandals than their bigger rivals. Philip Oltermann France With two German discounters muscling into the market and a growing aversion to megastores, the French retail industry bears some similarity to the UK's. As here, the French grocery sector is dominated by a small number of large firms. The main groups are Carrefour, Leclerc, Intermarch\u00e9 and Systeme U, plus the familiar names of Aldi and Lidl. The French grocery retail market was worth around \u20ac221bn in 2012 according to researcher IGD \u2013 similar to the UK total. Hypermarkets \u2013 outlets with more than 2,500 square metres of floor space \u2013 accounted for 42% of grocery sales in 2013, but have been declining in popularity since 2008, in a trend that has been repeated in the UK. Supermarkets and local stores have fared better. There has been a greater demand for neighbourhood outlets and shops on a more \"human scale\", according to a report from the French government. But while competition in France is fierce, it is not as openly cutthroat as in the UK and it is much more tightly regulated. Strict laws on the price of branded goods mean they should not be significantly cheaper in one store than in others as this would constitute \"unfair competition\". Laws also regulate opening hours and ban selling at a loss. Shops are not allowed to open on Sundays, or very late at night, except in designated tourist areas. Small family-owned and run \"corner\" shops are exempt from the regulations. One area where food shopping in France differs greatly from in the UK is the general absence of marketing devices such as buy-one-get-one-free (bogof) offers. While some supermarkets have introduced the concept, Arnaud Joly, an expert on food retailing for the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said French shops preferred adjusting prices to promotions. Kim Willsher Spain In the UK, Tesco is still, despite its travails, the clear market leader, and the situation is similar in Spain, where Mercadona is the undisputed powerhouse. Since 2012, the family-owned chain has had more than a fifth of market share, more than twice that of its closest competitor, French group Carrefour. While rivals fought to survive the country's economic crisis, Mercadona has grown, hiring thousands of employees to staff new stores opening across the country. The chain's allure lies in its low prices. Mercadona, which now has more than 1,500 stores across Spain, has made a science of trimming costs across the board. Its rivals attempt to compete with aggressive promotions and innovation. Carrefour had introduced a loyalty card and led the way when it came to innovation, said Eric Batty of Kantar Worldpanel. For example, it started offering ready-made sauces and prepared meals that were not available in other supermarkets. Meanwhile, a push by Lidl in Spain to add fresh produce to its stores made it the fastest-growing chain in terms of market share last year, increasing from 2.7% to 3.1% in the first half of 2013 and 2014 respectively. As the financial crisis eased its grip on Spain, shoppers' habits were shifting, said Batty. During the crisis, many stayed close to home, buying only what they needed week-to-week in an effort to save money. So far 2014 has been marked by a return to the out-of-town hypermarkets, where households shop less often but buy more on each trip. Those who stand to lose out as this trend grows are the specialists, such as bakeries, greengrocers and butchers, traditionally a big part of Spain's grocery offerings. Ashifa Kassam Italy Grocery shopping in Italy may conjure up images of vigorous open-air markets, or perhaps quaint delicatessens selling mouthwatering produce from the hills of Umbria. And so it is \u2013 for the privileged few. But for 60% of Italian families food shopping regularly involves a trip to one of the increasing numbers of discount supermarkets, such as Lidl or Eurospin. But dependence on the big stores is not on the same scale as in the UK; most Italians have an attachment to local food shops. But habits were changing, and the growth of supermarkets and discount stores \"has made those shops' lives tough\", said Francesco Daveri, an economist at the University of Parma. That is not the only area of competition. Between the discount stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets there is a constant battle going on to woo the increasingly cash-strapped consumer. \"Supermarkets are really the only sector [in Italy] where competition has worked out,\" said Liliana Cantone of Italian consumer association Altroconsumo. \"The players are doing their best to offer lower prices, and consumers can really benefit from this.\" As in Britain, the big names \u2013 among them Coop and Esselunga \u2013 were jolted by the arrival of discount stores selling similar products for much lower prices. Before long, consumers saw ever more vigorous battles over the prices of Easter eggs and Christmas panettoni, with loyalty card schemes vying with extravagant cuts for the best results. Lizzy Davies United States For the past 25 years America's grocery shopping habits have been dominated by the \"supercentre\". Many thought the dominance of massive, out-of-town stores \u2013 mainly owned by Walmart \u2013 would kill local supermarkets. But something is changing. This year Kroger, the US's largest supermarket chain, will pass $100bn revenue mark, despite having no presence overseas. This local chain has now enjoyed 43 consecutive quarters of growth. Walmart has taken note and is trying to get back into smaller, urban supermarkets after spending years trying to kill them off. John Rand of Kantar Retail in Boston has spent 47 years watching the US grocery business. The landscape, he said, had seldom been so competitive. \"There was a generation of shoppers who were fairly comfortable with a long, weekly shopping trip,\" he said. \"It was like the early days of America, with people going to market day once a week.\" But he said today's harried consumer wanted more convenience and to spend less time in the aisles. The result has been an increase in the number of options available to consumers. Where once they had two or three local competitors, now they have four. \"But still, if you are number four in that group, you are in trouble,\" he said. Dominic Rushe Australia The Australian grocery industry has for years been characterised by a battle between two giants. Together, supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths control roughly 70% of the A$82bn (\u00a344.5bn) sector. Aggressive price wars between the two are very visible, which is good for consumers but not so much for suppliers. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has carpeted both for their practices, and Jamie Oliver was dragged into the row when farmers complained of being charged a levy by Woolworths to pay for an ad campaign featuring his brand. Coles and Woolies' vast influence doesn't end at the grocery checkout. Their operations extend into alcohol, convenience stores, fuel, hardware, general goods, hotels and gambling. What's left of the market is fought over by independents \u2013 especially Metcash, which runs IGA, Foodland and other franchise brands \u2013 and big discounters such as Aldi and Costco. Aldi has made huge gains in market share in Australia, from about 3% in 2005 to 10% this year, with sales projected to keep increasing. Naturally this raises alarm bells for the big two and their duopoly. Jim Poe Japan Tesco is one of several foreign supermarkets to have tried and failed to succeed in Japan's notoriously challenging retail market. The firm pulled out of Japan in 2011 after spending eight years and \u00a3250m attempting to woo Japan's picky shoppers customers and navigate the country's labyrinthine distribution system. Japan's retail market, the second-biggest in the world, includes myriad supermarket chains, some of which operate only a handful of stores. Despite the fragmentation, a battle for control was emerging amid the arrival of new players and a flurry of mergers and acquisitions, said Roy Larke, an expert on Japanese consumer trends. Japan's biggest seller of food is now 7-Eleven, while the biggest supermarket chain, Aeon, has taken advantage of the regionally diverse food supply system by opening a string of local subsidiaries. The market is far from impenetrable, however. Walmart, the only \"everyday low pricing\" operator in Japan, has forced domestic rivals to keep their prices low where it operates stores. Costco, with 20 stores nationwide, has proved a success, offering prices comparable to those found in the US. Tesco's foray into Japan was frustrated, in part, by consumer idiosyncrasies. While bogof promotions are rare, individual supermarkets launch special deals every week, prompting shoppers to switch loyalties in search of a bargain. Justin McCurry China To the UK's beleaguered supermarkets, China may look like a gold mine. The country's grocery industry became the world's largest in 2012, and, according to the Institute of Grocery Distribution, reached US$1tn last summer, more than three times the size of the UK's. Yet the market is fractured and highly competitive. While western companies such as Walmart, Tesco, Metro and Carrefour have been operating in the country for years, if not decades, they're increasingly vying with a cohort of local chains, discount shops and convenience stores for customers who would often rather shop online. \"The top 10 or 12 companies represent less than half of the market,\" said Matthew Crabbe, of market research firm Mintel. Many foreign chains are expanding into second, third and fourth-tier cities, far from the bright lights and saturated markets of Beijing and Shanghai. Yet even there, supermarket chains are struggling. Local competition is fierce, the economy is slowing and e-commerce is on the rise. In 2013, Walmart, Carrefour and Tesco saw their mainland expansion slow by 27%. Walmart shut down five branches. \"All of these chains have realized they really need to localize and understand their market,\" Crabbe said. \"It's not about covering as much of the country as possible; it's about adapting to the regions you move into,\" said Crabbe. Some regions demand ample supplies of live fish, for example; others can't be without certain types of vegetables. Convenience stores are proliferating in pedestrian-friendly cities such as Shanghai; hypermarkets remain the model of choice in traffic-choked Beijing. Jonathan Kaiman South Africa For tourists to South Africa the big five means wild animals, but for supermarket shoppers it's a choice between Shoprite, Massmart, Pick n Pay, Spar and Woolworths. The competition is intense, with each regularly hyping loss-leading bargains, albeit not yet at cut-throat British levels. Many analysts believed the landscape would be transformed by the entrance in 2011 of Walmart, whose $2.4bn (\u00a31.5bn) takeover of Massmart was fiercely opposed by trade unions. The company declared a price war but its footprint remains relatively small compared to giants such as the Shoprite group, whose chief executive, Whitey Basson, is South African retail royalty. Meanwhile premium retailer Woolworths, the country's equivalent of Marks &amp; Spencer, is currently thriving despite being 24% more expensive than Pick n Pay on fresh food, according to a JP Morgan supermarket pricing survey published earlier this year. Woolworths' profits were up 15% in the year ending 29 June. It seems South Africa's growing middle class are willing to pay. David Smith",

There has been a greater demand for neighbourhood outlets and shops on a more \"human scale\", <a href=\"http://www.economie.gouv.fr/files/directions_services/dgccrf/documentation/dgccrf_eco/english/DGCCRF_eco11_mass_food_retail_economic_growth_France.pdf\" title=\"\">according to a report from the French government</a>.</p> <p>But while competition in France is fierce, it is not as openly cutthroat as in the UK and it is much more tightly regulated. Strict laws on the price of branded goods mean they should not be significantly cheaper in one store than in others as this would constitute \"unfair competition\". Laws also regulate opening hours and ban selling at a loss. Shops are not allowed to open on Sundays, or very late at night, except in designated tourist areas. Small family-owned and run \"corner\" shops are exempt from the regulations.</p> <p>One area where food shopping in France differs greatly from in the UK is the general absence of marketing devices such as buy-one-get-one-free (bogof) offers. While some supermarkets have introduced the concept, Arnaud Joly, an expert on food retailing for the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said French shops preferred adjusting prices to promotions. <br><strong>Kim Willsher </strong></p> <h2><strong>Spain</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>In the UK, Tesco is still, despite its travails, the clear market leader, and the situation is similar in Spain, where Mercadona is the undisputed powerhouse. Since 2012, the family-owned chain has had more than a fifth of market share, more than twice that of its closest competitor, French group Carrefour. While rivals fought to survive the country's economic crisis, Mercadona has grown, hiring thousands of employees to staff new stores opening across the country. The chain's allure lies in its low prices. Mercadona, which now has more than 1,500 stores across Spain, has made a science of trimming costs across the board.</p> <p>Its rivals attempt to compete with aggressive promotions and innovation. Carrefour had introduced a loyalty card and led the way when it came to innovation, said Eric Batty of Kantar Worldpanel. For example, it started offering ready-made sauces and prepared meals that were not available in other supermarkets. Meanwhile, a push by Lidl in Spain to add fresh produce to its stores made it the fastest-growing chain in terms of market share last year, increasing from 2.7% to 3.1% in the first half of 2013 and 2014 respectively.</p> <p>As the financial crisis eased its grip on Spain, shoppers' habits were shifting, said Batty. During the crisis, many stayed close to home, buying only what they needed week-to-week in an effort to save money. So far 2014 has been marked by a return to the out-of-town hypermarkets, where households shop less often but buy more on each trip.</p> <p>Those who stand to lose out as this trend grows are the specialists, such as bakeries, greengrocers and butchers, traditionally a big part of Spain's grocery offerings.<br> <strong>Ashifa Kassam</strong></p> <h2><strong>Italy</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Grocery shopping in Italy may conjure up images of vigorous open-air markets, or perhaps quaint delicatessens selling mouthwatering produce from the hills of Umbria.</p> <p>And so it is \u2013 for the privileged few. But for 60% of Italian families food shopping regularly involves a trip to one of the increasing numbers of discount supermarkets, such as Lidl or Eurospin. But dependence on the big stores is not on the same scale as in the UK; most Italians have an attachment to local food shops. But habits were changing, and the growth of supermarkets and discount stores \"has made those shops' lives tough\", said Francesco Daveri, an economist at the University of Parma.</p> <p>That is not the only area of competition. Between the discount stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets there is a constant battle going on to woo the increasingly cash-strapped consumer. \"Supermarkets are really the only sector [in Italy] where competition has worked out,\" said Liliana Cantone of Italian consumer association Altroconsumo. \"The players are doing their best to offer lower prices, and consumers can really benefit from this.\"</p> <p>As in Britain, the big names \u2013 among them Coop and Esselunga \u2013 were jolted by the arrival of discount stores selling similar products for much lower prices. Before long, consumers saw ever more vigorous battles over the prices of Easter eggs and Christmas <em>panettoni</em>, with loyalty card schemes vying with extravagant cuts for the best results.<br> <strong>Lizzy Davies</strong></p> <h2>United States </h2> <p>For the past 25 years America's grocery shopping habits have been dominated by the \"supercentre\". Many thought the dominance of massive, out-of-town stores \u2013 mainly owned by Walmart \u2013 would kill local supermarkets.</p> <p>But something is changing. This year Kroger, the US's largest supermarket chain, will pass $100bn revenue mark, despite having no presence overseas. This local chain has now enjoyed 43 consecutive quarters of growth. Walmart has taken note and is trying to get back into smaller, urban supermarkets after spending years trying to kill them off.</p> <p>John Rand of Kantar Retail in Boston has spent 47 years watching the US grocery business. The landscape, he said, had seldom been so competitive.</p> <p>\"There was a generation of shoppers who were fairly comfortable with a long, weekly shopping trip,\" he said. \"It was like the early days of America, with people going to market day once a week.\" But he said today's harried consumer wanted more convenience and to spend less time in the aisles.</p> <p>The result has been an increase in the number of options available to consumers. Where once they had two or three local competitors, now they have four. \"But still, if you are number four in that group, you are in trouble,\" he said. <br><strong>Dominic Rushe </strong></p> <h2><strong>Australia</strong></h2> <p>The Australian grocery industry has for years been characterised by a battle between two giants. Together, supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths control roughly 70% of the A$82bn (\u00a344.5bn) sector. Aggressive price wars between the two are very visible, which is good for consumers but not so much for suppliers. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has carpeted both for their practices, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/12/woolworths-backlash-levy-vegetables-jamie-oliver\" title=\"\">Jamie Oliver was dragged into the row when farmers complained of being charged a levy by Woolworths to pay for an ad campaign featuring his brand</a>.</p> <p>Coles and Woolies' vast influence doesn't end at the grocery checkout. Their operations extend into alcohol, convenience stores, fuel, hardware, general goods, hotels and gambling. What's left of the market is fought over by independents \u2013 especially Metcash, which runs IGA, Foodland and other franchise brands \u2013 and big discounters such as Aldi and Costco. Aldi has made huge gains in market share in Australia, from about 3% in 2005 to 10% this year, with sales projected to keep increasing. Naturally this raises alarm bells for the big two and their duopoly. <br><strong>Jim Poe</strong></p> <h2><strong>Japan</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Tesco is one of several foreign supermarkets to have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/28/retail3\" title=\"\">tried and failed</a> to succeed in Japan's notoriously challenging retail market. The firm <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/31/tesco-japan-pull-out-philip-clarke\" title=\"\">pulled out of Japan in 2011</a> after spending eight years and \u00a3250m attempting to woo Japan's picky shoppers customers and navigate the country's labyrinthine distribution system. Japan's retail market, the second-biggest in the world, includes myriad supermarket chains, some of which operate only a handful of stores.</p> <p>Despite the fragmentation, a battle for control was emerging amid the arrival of new players and a <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/09/30/us-seijoishii-m-a-lawson-idINKCN0HO2CN20140930\" title=\"\">flurry of mergers and acquisitions</a>, said Roy Larke, an expert on Japanese consumer trends. Japan's biggest seller of food is now 7-Eleven, while the biggest supermarket chain, Aeon, has taken advantage of the regionally diverse food supply system by opening a string of local subsidiaries.</p> <p>The market is far from impenetrable, however. Walmart, the only \"everyday low pricing\" operator in Japan, has forced domestic rivals to keep their prices low where it operates stores. Costco, with 20 stores nationwide, has proved a success, offering prices comparable to those found in the US. Tesco's foray into Japan was frustrated, in part, by consumer idiosyncrasies.</p> <p>While bogof promotions are rare, individual supermarkets launch special deals every week, prompting shoppers to switch loyalties in search of a bargain. <br><strong>Justin McCurry </strong></p> <h2><strong>China</strong></h2> <p>To the UK's beleaguered supermarkets, China may look like a gold mine. The country's grocery industry became the world's largest in 2012, and, according to the Institute of Grocery Distribution, <a href=\"http://www.igd.com/Media/IGD-news-and-press-releases/Chinas-grocery-market-reaches-US1trillion\" title=\"\">reached US$1tn last summer,</a> more than three times the size of the UK's. Yet the market is fractured and highly competitive. While western companies such as Walmart, Tesco, Metro and Carrefour have been operating in the country for years, if not decades, they're increasingly vying with a cohort of local chains, discount shops and convenience stores for customers who would often rather shop online.</p> <p>\"The top 10 or 12 companies represent less than half of the market,\" said Matthew Crabbe, of market research firm Mintel. Many foreign chains are expanding into second, third and fourth-tier cities, far from the bright lights and saturated markets of Beijing and Shanghai. Yet even there, supermarket chains are struggling. Local competition is fierce, the economy is slowing and e-commerce is on the rise. In 2013, Walmart, Carrefour and Tesco saw their mainland expansion slow by 27%.</p> <p>Walmart shut down five branches.</p> <p>\"All of these chains have realized they really need to localize and understand their market,\" Crabbe said. \"It's not about covering as much of the country as possible; it's about adapting to the regions you move into,\" said Crabbe. Some regions demand ample supplies of live fish, for example; others can't be without certain types of vegetables. Convenience stores are proliferating in pedestrian-friendly cities such as Shanghai; hypermarkets remain the model of choice in traffic-choked Beijing. <br><strong>Jonathan Kaiman </strong></p> <h2>South Africa </h2> <p>For tourists to South Africa the big five means wild animals, but for supermarket shoppers it's a choice between Shoprite, Massmart, Pick n Pay, Spar and Woolworths. The competition is intense, with each regularly hyping loss-leading bargains, albeit not yet at cut-throat British levels. Many analysts believed the landscape would be transformed by the entrance in 2011 of Walmart, whose $2.4bn (\u00a31.5bn) takeover of Massmart was fiercely opposed by trade unions. The company declared a price war but its footprint remains relatively small compared to giants such as the Shoprite group, whose chief executive, Whitey Basson, is South African retail royalty.</p> <p>Meanwhile premium retailer Woolworths, the country's equivalent of Marks &amp; Spencer, is currently thriving despite being 24% more expensive than Pick n Pay on fresh food, according to a JP Morgan supermarket pricing survey published earlier this year. Woolworths' profits were up 15% in the year ending 29 June. It seems South Africa's growing middle class are willing to pay. <br><strong>David Smith</strong></p>",
