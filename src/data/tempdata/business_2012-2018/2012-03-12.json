      "bodyText": "Eurozone leaders are locked in talks over how to tackle Greece's deteriorating government finances despite Athens having last week implemented the biggest debt writedown in history. Eurogroup ministers met in Brussels to agree the release of \u20ac130bn (\u00a3109bn) of funds to Greece after it succeeded in swapping the bulk of its privately-held bonds with new ones worth less than half their original value. Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos said he expected a positive verdict, though he may be forced to wait until Wednesday to receive formal approval while the group considers his plans to meet austerity targets, agreed as part of the deal. Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime minister and head of the eurogroup, said: \"There is no doubt that the second Greek programme will be approved.\" Athens is under intense pressure to push through cuts in spending and end protectionist laws before accessing the second tranche of funds. Entering the meeting, Greek officials voiced optimism that eurogroup finance ministers would finally approve the deal. \"It will be approved. The mood is very good,\" an official close to the talks said. It has taken eight months to get near closing the talks, and the relief is palpable. \"The meeting began with all the finance ministers starting with [German's Wolfgang] Sch\u00e4uble congratulating Venizelos,\" the official said. \"It's a good day for him and Greece.\" Though the bond swap will wipe \u20ac105bn off Greece's \u20ac368bn debt mountain, giving Athens breathing space to enact more austerity, many analysts think that the country's debt remains unsustainable. The yields on bonds issued under the swap deal, with maturities of between 11 and 30 years, were trading at rates that gave a yield, or effective interest rate, of 13%-19%, indicating that investors think Greece needs to cut its debt a lot more before it can return to markets for funding. European stock markets closed marginally higher on fears the Greek situation could deteriorate. Concerns over China having incurred its largest trade deficit in a decade also played on market fears, leaving the FTSE up only 5 points. \"Markets are telling us that Greece still faces a Herculean task,\" said Louise Cooper, markets analyst at BGC Partners. \"If the country's problems were solved by the biggest ever sovereign restructuring and the first default in Western Europe for 70 odd years \u2013 the last one was Italy in 1940 \u2013 then why are the new and shiny bonds trading for the first time today as junk?\" European Union structural funds worth \u20ac15bn could be released to Greece if it is judged to have sufficiently reformed. Horst Reichenbach, who heads a European Union task force helping Greece with taxation issues and modernising its bureaucracy, has backed a Marshall Aid-style plan for Greece if it can agree structural reforms, including of its byzantine judicial system. He is to meet union leaders, who have resisted structural changes, and the Greek justice minister, who is tasked with overhauling a justice system more often seen as a hindrance than a help to conducting business in the country. Officials in Lucas Papademos' interim coalition government brushed aside suggestions that Greece would require to be bailed out for a third time, possibly even before the end of the year. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble raised the spectre of yet more aid for Athens in an interview with the Belgian newspaper De Morgen. With the latest bailout, Greece will have received \u20ac240bn to date. \"Nobody can now exclude that Greece at a single moment may need a third bailout,\" he was quoted as saying. \"I have all confidence that the measures that we have taken and that Greece must now implement \u2013 no simple exercise \u2013 will bring the country on the road to recovery.\" But Greek government officials did concede that fears were growing of the country's economic and social tumult giving way to increased violence. Papademos convened a mini cabinet meeting to discuss the issue amid mounting concerns that anti-government protesters will attempt to disrupt Independence Day celebrations on 25 March. Spain is the next country after Greece to cause concern among the currency club's senior figures. Spain has said it would miss a deficit target of 4.4% of GDP for 2012 agreed with Brussels. It now expects the deficit to be 5.8%. Brussels is committed to fine countries that step out of line, but has already been told by Mariano Rajoy, Spain's new prime minister, that his government should be offered support and not punishment.",

Witty joined Glaxo as a management trainee and clearly adores the place. He can be seen in an online recruitment advert enthusing about how the pharmaceutical giant has lived up to all his expectations for his career. Glaxo has \"not disappointed for a single day,\" he tells graduates pondering where to send their CVs. But there's a problem \u2013 or so Sir Crispin Davis, chair of GSK's remuneration committee, thinks. The non-executives have identified \"a significant competitiveness gap for our CEO\". To wit, Witty can't earn enough. He should be given the chance to earn 600% of his \u00a31m-a-year salary under a long-term incentive plan, and not a mere 500%. As it happens, Glaxo makes a fair case that Witty's pay does indeed fall short of his peers', both in the pharmaceutical industry and among Britain's biggest companies. There are three charts in the pay report to illustrate the results of the benchmarking exercise undertaken by Davis's committee and the unspoken message seems clear enough: you should see what they hand out at Novartis, Roche, Barclays etc. Fair point. And, as the report also points out, Witty is paid considerably less than his predecessor, JP Garnier, and is seen to be doing a good job. Those with longer memories will also recall that Jan Leschly, boss of SmithKline Beecham, had accumulated a share option package worth $100m at the time of the merger with Glaxo Wellcome in 2000. Against that benchmark, Witty's take-home pay last year of \u00a35.7m (\u00a31m salary, \u00a32m bonus, \u00a33.7m long-term reward) looks positively mean. So it's a reasonable guess that Glaxo will not suffer an embarrassing vote against its remuneration report, as happened in 2003. What can be said, though, is that we've reached the point where the chief executive of a top FTSE 100 company can expect to earn about \u00a310m-a-year if all the performance targets are achieved. That's seems to be the approximate benchmark Glaxo is using. Would there be mass desertions to the detriment of shareholders if this potential annual jackpot was somehow halved overnight? Unlikely: not all bosses are one-company loyalists like Witty, but many of the best are.",

      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline boss Sir Andrew Witty's pay package more than doubled to \u00a36.7m last year \u2013 but the drugs group reckons he remains underpaid and has awarded him a new deal which could generate up to \u00a310.4m this year. Details of Witty's 2011 pay, revealed in the pharmaceutical company's annual report, show his salary and incentives payout doubled from \u00a33m to \u00a36.7m in 2011 after his \u00a31m salary was bolstered by a \u00a32m annual bonus and a \u00a33.7m payout from a three-year long-term incentive plan. But the company said it had \"identified a significant competitiveness gap\" in the pay of the chief executive and had decided to bolster the size of his long-term incentive plan from a maximum of \u00a35m a year to \u00a36m \u2013 some 600% of his salary. According to the company's calculations, this could hand Witty \u00a310.4m in 2012 if he meets all the performance criteria. Separately the newly knighted Witty's basic pay is also to rise, by 4%, in line with other staff. In the annual report, Sir Crispin Davis, the non-executive director who chairs the remuneration committee, said that the committee was \"mindful of its responsibility to pay appropriately but not excessively\" but had been concerned about the \"competitiveness gap\" for Witty when measured against a range of UK companies such as Anglo American, Vodafone, Barclays, Standard Chartered and HSBC. A number of global pharmaceutical companies are also used for the comparisons and the company said Witty's pay was still in the bottom quartile when compared with his pharmaceutical peers, even after the pay rise. The company, which was the first in the UK to have its pay policies voted down in 2003 over a pay deal for Witty's predecessor Jean-Pierre Garnier, said it already has shareholder approval for the changes to the chief executive's pay deal as the company's existing schemes permit 600% of Witty's salary to be handed out in share awards. In 2011 he received \u00a33.7m of a possible \u00a35m. The annual report also shows that Julian Heslop, the finance director who was replaced by former banker Simon Dingemans, was handed \u00a3945,000 in \"compensation for loss of office\" which took his total pay for 2011 to \u00a32.7m. Dingemans took home \u00a31.6m while Moncef Slaoui, who runs research and development, received $4.8m (\u00a33.1m). Davis acknowledged that Witty's pay had \"increased significantly\" from 2010, which he said \"directly reflects our pay for performance policy\". He argued that last year GSK had recorded its best total shareholder return \u2013 25% \u2013since the company was created just over a decade ago. \"The committee is very aware of the sensitive environment surrounding executive pay at a time of real economic challenge,\" Davis added. A spokesman for the company said Witty's leadership had been \"fundamental\" to the performance of the company in the last three years.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of jobs are to be created in Lancashire and across the UK following a deal to make components for a new jet fighter in the UK. The deal is a boost for Britain's largest defence contractor BAE and the wider aerospace industry which will benefit from the F-35 fighter jet-building programme. Components for the 3,000-strong fleet of jets are to be built by a number of companies up and down the country before the planes are assembled in the United States and begin to be delivered in 2015. The design and manufacture of the fifth generation aircraft is expected to create and sustain some 25,000 jobs in the UK over 30 years, according to Lockheed Martin, which is leading the contractorship. Involving around 130 firms across the country, it is projected to increase UK GDP by \u00a328.7bn over the period between 2009 and 2036. The Joint Strike Fighter planes, which have been in development since the mid-1990s, are expected to be used by the Ministry of Defence to replace Harrier and Tornado jets, with two of three test aircraft to be handed over to the UK in June. A number of other countries including Australia, Italy, Canada and the Netherlands have also already made orders, with the US buying the largest proportion to provide the bulk of its tactical air power. Work will primarily be carried out at the BAE Systems site at Samlesbury, Lancashire, where the fuselage and other structural components will be made. BAE said earlier this month it was determined to press ahead with 2,000 job cuts, including 750 compulsory redundancies at Brough in East Yorkshire where it will end manufacturing.

      "body": "<p>Markets hedged their bets as the European finance ministers met to consider approving the latest Greek bailout, and ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday.</p> <p>But private equity firm <strong>3i</strong> added 2.7p to 196.4p on talk of a possible management buyout of the business. This is not the first time such an idea has been mooted, given the investment group's poor share price performance. Rival private equity group Electra was said to be interested in a bid, but issued a statement saying it had no current intention of making an offer.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 5.26 points higher at 5892.75 while the FTSE 250 rose 35.94 points to 11,563.90. Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index, said:</p> <blockquote> The FTSE 100 traded flat for much of the day on Monday as small weakness in mining stocks curtailed gains in homebuilders and retail stocks after disappointing Chinese data dampened risk appetite. <br> In truth, it has been a fairly uneventful trading day on the FTSE 100 with many investors sitting on their hands somewhat and awaiting the latest Federal Reserve decision tomorrow night, where the market can gauge [its] appetite for a third round of quantitative easing. </blockquote> <p>A rise in the Chinese trade deficit left mining groups weaker. <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> fell 58.5p to 3450.5p while <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> dropped 52p to \u00a313.69.</p> <p>Banks were also unwanted, with <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> down 0.83p to 25.37p. A group of investors is planning legal action to try and recover \u00a32.4bn they lost by buying shares ahead of the bank being caught up in the financial crisis.</p> <p><strong>Morrisons</strong> rose 6.8p to 301.6p as it invited investors to St Albans to see its new store formats. Real estate investment companies built up rises on the back of last week's sale of developer Klepierre to US group Simon Property. <strong>Land Securities</strong> added 11.5p to 728p and <strong>Hammerson</strong> was 6.3p higher at 423.9p.</p> <p>But <strong>Man</strong> lost 2.3p to 137.5p after HSBC cut its rating on the hedge fund group from overweight to neutral. It said:</p> <blockquote> We cut our 2012 estimated earnings per share by 10.2% on higher distribution costs and taxes; our target price falls to 140p from 150p as a result. </blockquote> <p><strong>GKN</strong> fell 1.5p to 211p on worries about how it would fund any possible bid from Volvo's aerospace business, while IT group <strong>Misys</strong> lost 13p to 328p after Swiss rival Temenos pulled out of merger talks. That leaves the field clear for two possible private equity bidders but analysts are not sure an offer will emerge. George O'Connor of Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> We are not surprised that Temenos has walked away from Misys. The bid was less attractive to shareholders given, in our view, that the combo could not afford a cash sweetener and as the operational reality struck home the difficulties became more real, and the deal did little to help Temenos in its expansion in the US.

      "bodyText": "Markets hedged their bets as the European finance ministers met to consider approving the latest Greek bailout, and ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday. But private equity firm 3i added 2.7p to 196.4p on talk of a possible management buyout of the business. This is not the first time such an idea has been mooted, given the investment group's poor share price performance. Rival private equity group Electra was said to be interested in a bid, but issued a statement saying it had no current intention of making an offer. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 5.26 points higher at 5892.75 while the FTSE 250 rose 35.94 points to 11,563.90. Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index, said: The FTSE 100 traded flat for much of the day on Monday as small weakness in mining stocks curtailed gains in homebuilders and retail stocks after disappointing Chinese data dampened risk appetite. In truth, it has been a fairly uneventful trading day on the FTSE 100 with many investors sitting on their hands somewhat and awaiting the latest Federal Reserve decision tomorrow night, where the market can gauge [its] appetite for a third round of quantitative easing. A rise in the Chinese trade deficit left mining groups weaker. Rio Tinto fell 58.5p to 3450.5p while Vedanta Resources dropped 52p to \u00a313.69. Banks were also unwanted, with Royal Bank of Scotland down 0.83p to 25.37p. A group of investors is planning legal action to try and recover \u00a32.4bn they lost by buying shares ahead of the bank being caught up in the financial crisis. Morrisons rose 6.8p to 301.6p as it invited investors to St Albans to see its new store formats. Real estate investment companies built up rises on the back of last week's sale of developer Klepierre to US group Simon Property. Land Securities added 11.5p to 728p and Hammerson was 6.3p higher at 423.9p. But Man lost 2.3p to 137.5p after HSBC cut its rating on the hedge fund group from overweight to neutral. It said: We cut our 2012 estimated earnings per share by 10.2% on higher distribution costs and taxes; our target price falls to 140p from 150p as a result. GKN fell 1.5p to 211p on worries about how it would fund any possible bid from Volvo's aerospace business, while IT group Misys lost 13p to 328p after Swiss rival Temenos pulled out of merger talks. That leaves the field clear for two possible private equity bidders but analysts are not sure an offer will emerge. George O'Connor of Panmure Gordon said: We are not surprised that Temenos has walked away from Misys. The bid was less attractive to shareholders given, in our view, that the combo could not afford a cash sweetener and as the operational reality struck home the difficulties became more real, and the deal did little to help Temenos in its expansion in the US. This gives [private equity group] Vista a clearer run. However.. private equity has a habit of walking away from deals, and concern about this (and the operational backdrop at Misys) suggests that fear replaces greed \u2013 we see the share price dropping to the sum of the parts value \u2013 328p.

      "bodyText": "Game Group, the high street computer game retailer that is unable to sell keenly awaited new games including Mass Effect 3, Mario Party 9 and Street Fighter X Tekken, has officially warned investors that it is on the brink of collapse. The company said it had put itself up for sale but warned that \"it is uncertain whether any of the solutions currently being explored by the board will be successful or will result in any value being attributed to the shares of the company.\" Game desperately needs cash before the end of the month to pay its quarterly rent bill. If it fails to pay up it could be pushed into administration, putting 10,000 jobs at risk and wiping out any shareholder value. The warning sent the shares, which have already lost more than 95% of their value over the past year, crashing a further 65% to 1.2p, valuing the company at just \u00a34.3m. Ian Shepherd, the chief executive, has told senior staff to brace themselves for administration, according to trade magazine MCV. The boss of Electronic Arts, one of the world's biggest game publishers, has said it \"now looks like all but a certainty\" that Game will go bust. At a conference in New York this weekend John Riccitiello, EA's chief executive, said: \"It was a risk a month ago. Now it looks like a fact, although we're still praying for the lenders to get rational and keep them in business. You probably know who I'm talking about.\" EA, the publisher of Mass Effects 3 the UK's best-selling game, is one of three leading game publishers to have withdrawn their latest hits from sale at Game over fears they will not be able to reclaim the stock if the company goes bust. Capcom, the Californian company behind Street Fighter X Tekken and the Resident Evil games, have also refused to supply Game stores with their forthcoming games, and Nintendo has withdrawn its latest hit Mario Party 9 from Game's stores. Game has conceded it is involved in \"ongoing discussions\" with other suppliers also threatening to pull out. Customers have taken to industry blogs, including Eurogamer, to offer the company their advice. \"Game please remember that you will need to stock some games,\" said jrc1985. Vibroguy added: \"I think it would be easier if you just listed what Game is actually stocking :).\" In the glossy brochure sent to shareholders following its interim results, Game boasts: \"Our vision is to be our customers' first choice for all of their gaming needs.\" The company has appointed investment bank Rothschild to find a buyer, but it is likely to be difficult to find one before the looming deadline. Game's Spanish arm could attract the attention of US rival Gamestop, but its British, French and Australian divisions may be sold through a controversial pre-pack administration. Deloitte has already been in discussions with the firm about how to handle an insolvency. Game has 1,270 stores, some trading under the brand Gamestation, in nine European markets and Australia. There are 600 stores in the UK employing about 6,000 people. The company, which has debts of about \u00a370m, has already warned the City that it expects to report losses of about \u00a318m for the year to the end of January. Talk of its imminent demise could hasten Games's collapse as its 18m reward card holders rush to spend roughly \u00a310m worth of loyalty points. Game's woes have largely been caused by its failure to keep up with fast-moving internet retailers and supermarkets, who often sold titles as loss leaders to tempt people in to buy less popular older games. The industry is also moving away from physical games to rapidly growing, and highly profitable, digital downloads. Instead of splashing out \u00a340 on a video game CD for a \u00a3200 console, increasing numbers of consumers opt for 69p smartphone apps such as Angry Birds. The launch of the new Wii U this year, and the mooted launch of an updated Microsoft Xbox 360 next year, should provide a fillip to the physical video games market. But, the new Microsoft Xbox will reportedly not have a disc drive meaning everything will have to be downloaded. Game is still in talks with its lenders, led by Royal Bank of Scotland, which are allowing it to continue to trade after a renegotiation of its debts. Peter Smedley, an analyst at Charles Stanley, said: \"Barely five weeks since Game secured a lifeline from its lenders in return for commitment to an updated strategic plan, Game has confirmed speculation in the weekend press of how perilous its financial position has now become. Imminent collapse into administration is now a real possibility. \"The IMS [interim management statement] warns that the solutions being explored may not lead to any equity value left. There is simply too much uncertainty and considerable risk in a highly fluid situation for equity investors to become involved. We put our recommendation under review, with a view to suspending coverage. \"Game's financial position [it has debts of about \u00a370m] highlighted in the 3 February IMS has become crushingly more pressing than was apparent. That has dramatically foreshortened the time Game has had to take radical action in a precipitously evolving situation.\"",
