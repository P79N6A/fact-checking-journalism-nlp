      "bodyText": "Youth unemployment figures published this week have underlined the contrasting economic fortunes of two cities an hour\u2019s drive apart, with Wolverhampton having one of the highest jobless rates for 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK, and Coventry one of the lowest. The Guardian visited the two cities to find how their paths have diverged and why young people appear to have such comparative success in finding a job in Coventry, while the story is so different in Wolverhampton. Wolverhampton According to a study commissioned by accountants EY, 27% of young people in Wolverhampton are unemployed. This is despite a number of economic successes for the West Midlands city, including a Jaguar Land Rover engine plant and the establishment of several hi-tech businesses. But one expert suggested that the gap between Wolverhampton and Coventry may have been exaggerated. Prof Anne Green of the Institute for Employment Research at Warwick University said figures that break down unemployment into age groups are based on small sample sizes and should be treated carefully. \u201cThe small sample size can exaggerate the extent of the gap between one place and another,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we do know that the average skill level in the Black Country is lower than the south-east of the area around Coventry.\u201d Politicians in Wolverhampton are trying to distance the city from the idea of lower skills levels. From its beginnings as a market town heavily linked to the wool trade, Wolverhampton embraced the industrial revolution. For much of the past century, children followed their parents into heavy manufacturing industries and learned on the job. John Wood, the corporate services director of steelmaker Liberty, said companies are having to cope with an ageing workforce and a lack of skilled new entrants to replace retiring colleagues. \u201cCompanies round here are realising they\u2019ve got to deal with a ticking timebomb, which is an ageing workforce,\u201d he said, adding that the apprenticeship levy is another incentive to train people, because companies will receive a refund on it if they take on trainees. \u201cThere is the need for people with higher skills and the extra cost of the apprenticeship levy, which will cost them money unless they train people. All three have created a change in the thinking among manufacturers,\u201d he said. Schools in the Wolverhampton area have only recently succeeded in raising GCSE results above the national average. Wolverhampton University is credited with developing skills training alongside higher education. But for children from poorer backgrounds, the level of support remains ad hoc compared with Coventry. Business groups visit schools and offer mentoring, but the onus is on schools to connect with individual businesses. The Black Country chamber of commerce, which could play a major role, has been without a chief executive for six months. Further education colleges are the backbone of training for many 16 to 18-year-olds and have faced severe cuts in recent years. Adrian Wright, the president of the chamber, said FE colleges were mostly rated outstanding by Ofsted, meaning the quality of people leaving them was good, but many young people were failing to bridge the gap into employment. \u201cI think there is a bit of a disconnect between our manufacturers and those colleges,\u201d he said. About 40% of chamber members are manufacturers and most are crying out for apprentices. \u201cBut there is more investment in technology than in training,\u201d Wright said Throughout the New Labour era, business leaders say, the local council was a barrier to change, but it is now a key partner in bringing investment to the area. Cllr John Reynolds, who is responsible for skills and development at Wolverhampton council, said the authority has plans to regenerate the city centre, creating a canalside quarter with towpaths safe for cyclists next to renovated warehouses. Wolverhampton has spent the past 30 years being hollowed out following an exodus of shops and employers to greenfield sites outside the city. His job is to entice a new breed, starting with a Debenhams store and a multiplex cinema to provide much-needed service sector jobs. Coventry Coventry has fared much better after a decade of investment that made it less dependent on manufacturing. This helps balance out the employment market, because manufacturing demands higher-skilled workers, who then become fewer in number as the business grows more sophisticated and workers are replaced by machines. The service sector has stepped into that gap. The rise in services employment in the city comes from an increase in hotels, shops and leisure facilities. It is the key factor in a youth unemployment rate that stands at 8.2%, according to EY. Cllr Kevin Maton, the head of education and skills at Coventry city council, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always had an underdeveloped services sector. Very few hotels, restaurants and other businesses that young people traditionally went into and gave them their first taste of work.\u201d The council, keen to bring young people into the city centre, has recently sold to Coventry University land next to the town hall, allowing it to develop a site next to the train station. This provides vital construction jobs, said Rachael Stewart, who works on skills and employment for the local enterprise partnership. Stewart has helped recreate the Connexions careers service scrapped by the last government, creating support for schools that now advise children on their career paths. Sally Lucas, the executive director of training at the Coventry and Warwickshire chamber of commerce, works with the LEP, the council, schools and colleges to coordinate funding, and seek out grants from EU and lottery funds. It means that the level of coordination between the agencies that deal with young people surpasses Wolverhampton in breadth and depth. Maton said the arrival of Wasps in 2014 was another boon for the city. The rugby club had a long tradition of engagement with school children and forced Coventry City to \u201cup its game\u201d in response. \u201cThere are some who might criticise us as a Labour council for being too close to employers, but that is about engaging with local businesses. And we still have power in that relationship, so if we find they are using zero-hours contracts and paying less than the minimum wage, we are not standing on the sidelines, we can do something about it,\u201d he said.",

It may be almost unknown in the UK, but Reserved is part of LPP, one of the fastest growing fashion chains in Europe.

Our presence is quite strong in Poland, Russia and the Baltic region but that is not enough to become a global brand.\u201d LPP has been seeking a site in London for some time as part of a shift westwards which includes a store opening in Berlin next year. It is also looking for flagships in other western European capitals including Paris and Milan. The London store will take up a third of the former BHS site, including the entire Oxford Street frontage. Founded 21 years ago by civil engineering graduate Marek Piechocki and fellow entrepreneur Jerzy Lubianiec, whose initials form the basis of the group\u2019s name, LPP listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in 2001. It is now one of Poland\u2019s top 20 listed companies. The business operates across Europe including Germany, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Croatia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Russia and Ukraine. Last year it expanded into the Middle East, with stores opening in Egypt, Kuwait and Qatar. Next year it is planning to move into Belarus and Kazakhstan via franchise partners as well as opening in London. By the end of this year it expects to have 1,700 stores and is also expanding its global online presence. \u201cIt\u2019s Poland\u2019s answer to Zara owner Inditex,\u201d says Lorna Hall, head of market intelligence at fashion consultancy WGSN. \u201cIt\u2019s a very professional outfit which has benefited from Poland\u2019s fast-growing market which is switched on to fashion and has a young family-focused demographic.\u201d The Gda\u0144sk-based clothing retailer employs about 20,000 people globally and at present has more than 1,600 stores. In 10 years it has increased store numbers sixfold while sales have risen by more than \u20ac1bn (\u00a3840m) to reach almost \u20ac1.3bn last year, 70% of which are booked in Poland. Ray Gaul, head of global research and analytics at consultancy Kantar Retail, said after moving into its first western European country, Germany, in 2014 LPP must have gained confidence that Reserved could travel outside eastern Europe. He added that in the UK, the brand would benefit from being well known to Polish emigrants. \u201cThe Polish now make up the largest [non-British] ethnic group in the UK. That\u2019s a good sign for Reserved. They will already have a strong foundation of expats who would recognise the brand and are perhaps interested in shopping there,\u201d he said. Hall agreed Reserved would be helped by being recognisable to Polish families living in and visiting the capital. However, she said that the chain\u2019s family ethos, which is less trend led than the likes of Zara or H&amp;M and priced somewhere between H&amp;M and Primark, would not necessarily take off here. \u201cThe UK is the most competitive market in the world. LPP will know this market and will have visited often but it\u2019s still challenging for retailers coming in because there is already so much choice.\u201d She said having a site in London was important for brands wanting a global presence, with LPP\u2019s move likely to be more an international marketing statement rather than the start of a significant UK presence. LPP confirmed it did not have plans for more UK stores but would be launching online here at the same time as it opens its Oxford Street site. The spokeswoman said: \u201cWe know the UK is a tough market but this flagship on Oxford Street is a marketing move. We want to show our clients we are a global brand \u2013 if they go to Berlin, the UK and the Middle East they will see the Reserved logo everywhere.\u201d The move into London comes at a time of rapid growth for LPP, although its main Reserved brand has experienced some difficulties after relying perhaps too heavily on one fashion trend: the retro look. It has now hired a new creative director to help overhaul its range and is revamping its products and logistics operation. Gaul said: \u201cMost of LPP\u2019s success has so far been with its Reserved brand but now it is diversifying, which is a good sign. It is getting a good mix of up and coming brands focused on different types of consumer to balance out any ups and downs. You often find in fashion that when the more luxury brands are not performing the discount brands do so \u2013 that\u2019s a natural hedge.\u201d In the UK, he suggested LPP will have to step up its game online, in a market where tech-loving UK shoppers expect to be able to browse via mobile phones, tablet computers or apps. Keeping pace with the highly competitive UK market, where online shopping continues to challenge traditional high street players, will just be part of LPP\u2019s challenge to ensure it\u2019s not just another three letter acronym footnote in history. That was the fate of BHS after all.",

    "webTitle": "Weak US jobs report dampens prospect of rate rise  - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Oil prices have lost some of their gains after the US added more rigs last week, for the ninth week in ten. According to Baker Hughes, one oil and seven gas rigs were added, taking the total to 497. With worries about oversupply amid weak demand, Brent crude - up 3.2% ahead of the rig cound - is now up 2.7% at $46.68. On that note, it\u2019s time to close the blog for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Heading into the weekend, investors were in buoyant mood, with the weaker than expected US jobs figures seemingly delaying any interest rate rise from the Federal Reserve until later in the year. A jump in oil prices also helped sentiment. So European markets moved sharply higher, while Wall Street was also in the ascendency. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 148.63 points or 2.2% at 6894.60, its biggest one day rise since 30 June and its highest close for two weeks Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 1.42% to 10,683.82 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.31% higher at 4542.17 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.54% to 17,183.90 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.67% at 8908.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 582.13 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 76 points or 0.4%. Markets are finished the week on a strong note following the US jobs data, which seemed to take a September rate rise off the table. In particular, the FTSE 100 has caught fire in late trading, surging more than 2.5%. This would be the biggest daily rise since 29 June. And analysts believe there could be more to come. Joshua Mahony at IG said: As we move out of the summer lull, there is a feeling that today will mark moment where things move into full swing once more. While volatility has been somewhat lacking owing to diminished summer volumes, the introduction of Autumn coupled with today\u2019s breakout in the FTSE 100 could set us up for a resurgent period in UK stocks. In the immediate wake of the weak US jobs data, the dollar stumbled, on the basis that a September rate rise now looked unlikely. But the US currency has bounced back, with a number of analysts still anticipating the Fed will hike borrowing costs in December. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar is now up 0.22% while the euro has slipped 0.3% against the US currency. Back with the earlier UK construction figures: If the US jobs data disappointed, then factory goods orders have shown their biggest increase in nine months. New orders for manufactured goods rose 1.9% in July after falling by 1.8% in the previous months, according to the Commerce Department. This was just shy of expectations of a rise of 2%. The June figure was revised up from an initially reported 1.5%. The chances of a September rate rise by the US Federal Reserve have dropped from 34% to 20% following the weaker than expected jobs data, according to Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX. But a hike in December is not off the table. Vecchio said: While almost every headline jobs growth read has been dubbed \u201cmost important non-farm payrolls\u201d for the last year and a half, this one certainly held importance. This report comes on the heels of Fed Chair Janet Yellen saying that recent economic data have supported the case for a rate hike and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer saying that the Fed cannot afford \u201cone and done.\u201d Immediately following the report, Fed funds futures contracts were implying a 20% chance of a rate hike in September, down from 34% ahead of the jobs data. Let\u2019s not mince words: after forecasting four rates hikes in 2016 at their December 2015 meeting, the Fed needs to hike at least once this year \u2013 December, most likely, when their last SEP of the year comes out \u2013 to save face. Dr. Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research, is also suggesting a December move: The August employment report showed solid employment gains, a stable unemployment rate, but weaker details, notably a decline in the average workweek and softer average hourly earnings. As the August numbers have tended to come in on the softer side in the past, we think that this mostly reflects seasonal adjustment problems rather than underlying weakness. The report thus leaves the Fed on track for a rate hike in December \u2013 September seems to be off the table now. US investors have also got that Friday feeling, with markets rising in early trading: Dow Jones: + 0.4% at 18,498 S&amp;P 500: +0.4% at 2,180 Nasdaq: +0.4% at 5,250 As in Europe, there is relief on Wall Street that a September rate hike appears to be off the table. European investors are in an upbeat mood as the week draws to a close. Miners are behind much of the rise, as commodity prices rise on a weaker dollar, and sentiment has improved now that a US rate hike in September looks increasingly unlikely. FTSE 100: +1.5% at 6,850 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.9% at 10,626 France\u2019s CAC: +1.6% at 4,509 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.6% at 17,030 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1% at 8,847 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +1.2% at 348 The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is up 1.7% at $46.24 after the weak US jobs report sent the dollar sharply lower. The US West Texas Intermediate futures rose 1.8% to $43.93 a barrel. Despite the rise, Brent crude is still on track for its biggest weekly decline since late July because of concerns about over supply. This is what happened to the euro v dollar immediately after payrolls: The US jobs report also showed the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9% in August. It was expected to ease slightly to 4.8%. Earnings growth of 0.1% was also weaker than July, when wages increased by 0.3%. Economists predicted 0.2% growth. James Knightley, a senior economist at ING, says the Fed is likely to wait until 2017 to raise rates (but a December hike is not off the table): The report doesn\u2019t support the case for a September rate hike, probably being more consistent with our current view that the first quarter of 2017 is the more likely point the Fed chooses to raise rates. After all inflation pressures are very benign and the US election has the potential to weigh on sentiment and activity a touch. On the other hand, an increasing number of Fed speakers have suggested that they are comfortable to hike rates despite relatively subdued employment growth meaning a December move should not be ruled out. Here is the full story on the US non-farm payrolls report: The pound hit a one-month high against the dollar after the weak US payrolls report, now up 0.4% at $1.3320. Reaction to those surprisingly weak US non-farm payrolls is coming in: Figures just out show non-farm payrolls were up 151,000 in August, disappointing forecasts of 180,000 and way below July\u2019s upwardly revised 275,000. This will pour cold water on expectations that the Fed will raise rates in September. US markets are expected to open lower: Five minutes until non-farm payrolls... The dollar is treading water ahead of the US employment figures due shortly. Against a basket of currencies it is down just 0.09% at 95.7, after falling 04% on Thursday after weaker than expected manufacturing figures. Meanwhile the pound has edged up 0.02% to $1.3270. The non-farm payrolls will give investors and economists further clues as to whether the US Federal Reserve is likely to increase interest rates at this month\u2019s meeting. Economists polled by Reuters believe the ECB will leave policy unchanged when the governing council meets next week. However, they believe eurozone policymakers will vote for an extension to their asset purchasing programme by the end of 2016. The ECB has been buying mostly government bonds for over a year, and currently at a rate of \u20ac80bn a month. Interest rates are at zero and deposit rates - those paid by banks to hold money at the central bank \u2013 are negative. Despite these measures, inflation is just 0.2%, well below the ECB\u2019s target of close to but just below 2%. Back in Dublin, a protestor from Irish campaign group Uplift is pictured with an open letter to the government, urging it to drop plans to appeal the EU\u2019s Apple tax ruling. The protestor is dressed as Snow White, the fairytale character offered a poisoned apple by the evil queen. Uplift wants the government to take the money - up to \u20ac13bn plus interest \u2013 from US tech giant Apple, and invest it in public services. The European Central Bank is moving into focus as policymakers get ready for business at next week\u2019s meeting. There has been mounting speculation that recently weak eurozone data will prompt ECB president Mario Draghi and his colleagues into action. But Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, says we shouldn\u2019t expect too much: It has been almost three months since the UK Brexit referendum and economic data in the eurozone seems largely unaffected. Given the general assessment that the eurozone has dodged a bullet, we suspect that the ECB will only marginally tweak forecasts and will be less likely to expand its easing programme. We expect that Draghi will opt for a wait-and-see strategy based on the impact of the Fed policy decisions. In the absence of any sudden shifts in Europe\u2019s economic outlook, the ECB will stay on the sidelines with its current policy mix. We anticipate that the ECB will wait for the December meeting before announcing any official extension to quantitative easing and combine it with further adjustments to economic projections. By December\u2019s meeting, the longer term effects of Brexit should begin to become more apparent. Some Twitter reaction now to the news this morning that Southern rail owner Go-Ahead made almost \u00a3100m profit last year despite the travel misery endured by its customers: An old ally of Taoiseach Enda Kenny has piled the pressure on the Irish Premier over the Apple tax debacle. Former Fine Gael minister Phil Hogan has urged the current Irish government to accept Brussels\u2019 ruling that Apple owes the Irish exchequer billions in unpaid tax. The former environment minister is now the EU commissioner for agriculture. Hogan confirmed on Friday that he joined the other 27 commissioners in Brussels in backing the ruling against Apple. He said it was a \u201ccollegiate decision\u201d made by every commissioner including himself. Hogan, who helped introduce the controversial water charges in Ireland as part of the last Fine Gael-Labour government, was Enda Kenny\u2019s nominee for the EU agriculture post. European markets are up as investors await the US payrolls report for August (published at 13.30 UK time). Ana Thaker, market economist at Phillip Capital, says markets are currently pricing in a 34% probability of a September rate hike: US non-farm payrolls promise to be crucial for markets on tenterhooks for data that could spur the Fed into a rate hike. The August payrolls figure could confirm speculation from FOMC members that the labour market is strong enough to withstand a rate hike. However, average hourly wages are set to drop a touch which could be used a reason to defer a rate hike further despite comments from both Yellen and her second in charge, Fischer. Yesterday\u2019s poor ISM PMIs saw the dollar fall rapidly and indicates the fragility of the currency. However, if the labour market proves to be robust, the FOMC may be left with no choice but to tighten despite weakness in other areas. In Ireland, 10,000 people have signed a petition urging the government to accept the EU ruling that Apple must pay up to \u20ac13bn in back taxes, and to drop plans to appeal the decision. The Guardian\u2019s Henry McDonald in Dublin reports that the petition is to be handed over to the Irish Parliament this morning by protestors, including one dressed up as Snow White: A petition containing 10,000 signatures is being handed over to the Irish parliament this morning urging Finance Minister Michael Noonan not to appeal against the EU ruling against Apple. Uplift, the organisers of the petition and protest, said one of their members dressed up as Snow White because she \u201cfamously ended up in a coma after being tricked into eating a poisoned apple.\u201d The \u20ac13 billion the EU believes Apple owes in tax to Ireland has become a politically poisonous issue which has split the Irish Cabinet. Fine Gael and Independent members of the minority coalition government have failed so far to reach an agreement on how to respond to the EU decision. The petition and protest on Friday highlights the political damage the row could inflict on a government that wants to defend Ireland\u2019s reputation as a low-tax bridgehead into the European market for mainly US based hi-tech multi-national corporations. The letter states: Dear Minister Noonan, Everyone has to pay their tax and that includes Apple, one of the world\u2019s most wealthy corporations. When they\u2019re allowed to avoid paying their tax bill, we all suffer. As the Minister for Finance you have a duty to protect and safeguard the interests of every man, woman and child in Ireland. You claim you do not have enough money in the public exchequer to ensure quality healthcare for everyone; to properly resource our schools and universities; to ensure every worker has a living wage, to end homelessness. Apple\u2019s tax bill would go a long way to solving these problems. We, the undersigned, remind you that you have a choice and an opportunity to stand up for the people of Ireland over the interests of Apple. We call on you to not appeal the decision that Apple owes Ireland \u20ac13bn. Don\u2019t stand in the way of Apple paying what they owe. Mike Chappell, construction expert at Lloyds commercial banking said the PMI survey was encouraging for the industry: The past month has seen a number of the bigger players in the sector report robust results with a relatively upbeat outlook, suggesting there may have been less negative impact from the EU referendum result than was originally feared, at least at the top of the market. This data provides further reassurance, although the headline reading still remains below 50, which separates growth from contraction. The order books of larger firms, many of which benefit from diversified revenue streams, appear to be in good shape, while several have either increased or restored their dividends. That said, anecdotal evidence indicates those further down the chain \u2013 such as mid-tier contractors and SMEs \u2013 are less bullish and more likely to adopt a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach. The breakdown of the construction PMI shows civil engineering was the strongest part of the industry in August, rising to 50 from 47.1 in July. Housebuilding and commercial building such as offices and shops were still shrinking, but at slower rates than in July. Housebuilding rose to 48.2 from 45.6, while commercial rose to 48.2 from 43.9. Firms in the sector took on more workers last month, and were feeling the most confident about the business outlook in three months. At 49.2, the headline index suggests acivity in the construction sector has been shrinking for the past three months. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said construction firms were still concerned about the Brexit vote: The downturn in UK construction activity has eased considerably since July, primarily helped by a much slower decline in commercial building. Construction firms cited a nascent recovery in client confidence since the EU referendum result and a relatively steady flow of invitations to tender in August. However, the latest survey indicates only a partial move towards stabilisation, rather than a return to business as usual across the construction sector. There were still widespread reports that Brexit uncertainty had dampened demand and slowed progress on planned developments, especially in relation to large projects. Despite another month of reduced output, the latest figures can be viewed as welcome news overall after a challenging summer for the construction sector. Britain\u2019s construction sector was in better shape than expected in August according to the Markit/CIPS PMI. The headline index increased to 49.2 from 45.9 in July, beating City forecasts of a smaller rise to 46.1. The sector was still shrinking however, as any number below 50 signals contraction. But the rate of contraction slowed nevertheless. A report published overnight by YouGov and Cebr showed a rebound in UK business confidence in August. It followed a sharp drop in July, the month after the Brexit vote, and is the latest sign that initial panic over the referendum result has subsided. The index rose to 109.7 in August from 105 in July. Confidence was lower than before the EU vote however, with the index at 112.6 in June. Scott Corfe, director at Cebr: The dust is settling on the EU vote and businesses are showing signs of resilience, for now at least. With the post-Brexit panic abating and many indicators signalling a reasonably robust short-term outlook, businesses are suggesting a greater confidence for the coming 12 months when it comes to their own operations. However, one red flag in these figures is the level of pessimism about the UK economy that the Brexit vote has engendered in British businesses. If these concerns materialise into reality, businesses could rapidly rein in their investment and hiring plans.\u201d The rail union RMT has responded with anger to the news that Southern rail owner Go-Ahead made almost \u00a3100m in profit last year while commuters suffered travel misery. General secretary Mick Cash says: While Go-Ahead have been driving Britain\u2019s biggest rail franchise into total meltdown the cash has been sloshing through the boardroom at obscene levels. This is reward for total failure on a scale which is off the map. Just a fraction of these profits would be enough to keep the guards on Southern trains, keep the passengers safe and resolve the industrial dispute between RMT and the company. It is shameful that they have opted to hoard cash instead of protecting the travelling public. It is also deeply cynical that Southern/Go-Ahead have brought forward this mega profit announcement so it doesn\u2019t clash with the strike action by guards next week. They are a money-raking disaster that has turned Britain\u2019s railways into a global laughing stock and they should be slung out and replaced by the public sector option. The pound is roughly flat this morning. It is up 0.02% against the dollar at $1.3270, and up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1857. Analysts are pondering whether this might be the bottom for the pound for the time being. It has fallen by about 10% since the 23 June Brexit vote, but the latest data suggests the economy performed better than expected in August. The FTSE 100 is up 24 points or 0.4% in early trading, making up some of Thursday\u2019s lost ground. This is how markets across Europe are looking: FTSE 100: +0.4% at 6,770 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 10,523 France\u2019s CAC: +0.2% at 4,448 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 16,987 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 8,750 Europe\u2019s STOXX: -0.01% at 344 Connor Campbell at Spreadex, says the UK construction PMI at 9.30 could be interesting to markets following the August surge in manufacturing. After taking a hit following the pound\u2019s post-manufacturing PMI surge the FTSE is aiming to regain some of the ground it lost this Friday, jumping just shy of half a percent as the European session got underway. With most of the focus on the US non-farm jobs report this afternoon there isn\u2019t much for investors to deal with this morning. Nevertheless one would imagine that considering that shock boost to manufacturing in August the markets will be interested to see whether or not the UK construction sector has seen a similar recovery. Any positive surprise to the construction PMI will likely benefit the pound more than the FTSE, even if sterling used up quite a lot of its market goodwill yesterday. Frequent travellers on Southern rail services might not be best pleased to hear its parent company Go-Ahead made a \u00a399.8m profit in the last year, up 27%. It follows a summer of commuter misery for passengers faced with delays, cancellations, and suspended routes at the hands of Southern rail. Go-Ahead said its chief executive David Brown would forgo his annual bonus and declined a pay rise. Brown said: Southern services have been disrupted by restricted network capacity, strike action and increased levels of absence. We apologise to the people whose lives have been affected during this time. We continue to work closely with the Department for Transport, Network Rail and other suppliers and partners to operate the best service possible while delivering the long term improvements. Read the full story on the results here. For an alternative perspective, follow the Guardian\u2019s Martin Belam who is live blogging his way around Southern rail services this morning: European markets are expected to open higher today before the US jobs data: The FTSE 100 closed down 0.5% on Thursday, despite a major and unexpected rebound in the UK manufacturing PMI survey for August. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets explains: There was some divergence between UK stock indices on Thursday with the FTSE 250 ending the day over half a percent higher whilst the FTSE 100 lost 0.5%. The divergence came about as a result of a surprise return to expansion for the UK manufacturing industry in August. Investors pulled funds out of multinationals exposed to a stronger pound and reallocated them into domestically focused firms that benefit from a resilient UK economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s non-farm payrolls day. And this one takes on major significance for investors as it the last one before the next policy meeting of the US Federal Reserve on 20-21 September. Janet Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chair, and her colleagues on the FOMC have repeatedly stated they will look to the latest data before making their decision. The payrolls report is the crucial indicator on the state of the US jobs market, and economists are expecting the August report to show an increase of 180,000, following a 255,000 increase in July. Any number in line with or above forecasts will fuel expectations of a rate hike this month. Any number below will have the opposite effect, especially following Thursday\u2019s weak ISM manufacturing report for August.",

      "bodyText": "In the City of London, it\u2019s the ultimate sartorial faux pas. \u201cNever wear brown in town,\u201d runs the adage about what shoes the gentlemen of London\u2019s financial district must eschew in order to escape the opprobrium of colleagues. This unwritten rule works to the disadvantage of people from less affluent backgrounds, according to a study by the government\u2019s social mobility commission. The commission found that graduates with first-class degrees from elite universities are being \u201clocked out\u201d from jobs in investment banking if they commit the cardinal sin of wearing brown shoes. The same goes for those who appear uncomfortable in a suit, wear a loud tie, or lack esoteric qualities such as \u201cpolish\u201d or \u201caura\u201d. According to the report, catchily titled Socio-Economic Diversity in Life Sciences and Investment Banking, such rigid criteria have \u201cset up barriers for individuals from non-privileged backgrounds\u201d. Leadenhall Market, in the heart of the City, is where hundreds of financial hotshots spend their lunch breaks, grabbing gourmet sandwiches from a clutch of hole-in-the-wall cafes or sinking pints of lager in one of its historic pubs. While there are plenty of brown shoes in evidence, most people passing through are well aware of the unwritten regulatory framework governing footwear. \u201cBrown in town isn\u2019t done, it\u2019s just sartorially wrong,\u201d says Mark Baker, who works with many financial services firms for IT company IPsoft. \u201cThe guys in Savile Row would turn in their graves. It\u2019s important to dress appropriately based on the clients you work with.\u201d Jason Meyers, 43, whose design and construction firm counts several financial services companies among its clients, is aware of the rulebook but isn\u2019t a fan. Referring to a pair of high-end shoemakers, he says: \u201cIf you work in insurance they won\u2019t let you through the door of [insurance market] Lloyd\u2019s of London without a pair of black Church\u2019s or Cheaneys.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll put on my black shoes if I\u2019m meeting a client in finance or insurance. You\u2019re looked at like a bit of a spiv if not.\u201d When it comes to job interviews, he says some employers discriminate against those who weren\u2019t raised in an environment where the colour of one\u2019s shoe leather was deemed important. \u201cIt\u2019s the City, so of course there\u2019s a class issue.\u201d And where class is an issue, schooling is never far behind. Meyers adds: \u201cIf you\u2019ve been to Eton or Winchester the interview is practically a formality anyway. If one candidate has been to Eton and the other to a comprehensive, the guy from Eton gets the job. If both candidates have been to Eton but one is wearing brown shoes, the other guy will get it.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Irish government has decided to appeal against the European commission\u2019s ruling that Apple was given a sweetheart tax deal and should hand Dublin \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in fiscal payments. The cabinet decision still needs to be endorsed by parliament next Wednesday but a group of independents in the ruling coalition who were concerned about the appeal have already been won over. \u201cA motion will come before the D\u00e1il [parliament] on Wednesday seeking an endorsement of that [cabinet] decision,\u201d a government spokesman said. The tax deal has proved divisive, with the leftwing Sinn F\u00e9in party highlighting some voter concerns that the government is in effect turning down a windfall payment that would fund the struggling national health service for a year. But it also plays into wider debates taking place in Britain and elsewhere about whether large corporations are avoiding their tax responsibilities. The counter-argument is that EC bureaucrats are in danger of chasing away multinationals that bring significant numbers of jobs to countries. Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, said Europe had overstepped the mark in attempting to dictate tax laws and impose current laws on a tax deal with Apple that had been struck 25 years ago. \u201cI believe that there are some very important principles at stake in this case and that a robust legal challenge before the courts is essential to defend Ireland\u2019s interests,\u201d he said. \u201cHow could any investor come to Europe if their business was subject to retrospective taxes two decades later?\u201d Earlier in the week Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, described the EC\u2019s decision as maddening and political. Cook wasconfident that it could be overturned on appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, it\u2019s clear that this comes from a political place, it has no basis in fact or in law, and unfortunately it\u2019s one of those things we have to work through,\u201d he said. Cook called on Irish ministers to join the case against Brussels, saying it would undermine the other foreign investment in Ireland, which is a major source of jobs. Noonan has repeatedly condemned the EC, which started investigating Apple\u2019s tax arrangements in Ireland two years ago. But Margrethe Vestager, the EC competition commissioner, has said it was wrong for Apple to have paid the equivalent of 1% corporation tax on its European profits in 2003 and that this was down to 0.0005% by 2014. Apple disputes these figures but Vestager has made her case clear: \u201cMember states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies - this is illegal under Euopean Union state aid rules. \u201cThe commission\u2019s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years.\u201d The US government has waded in on behalf of Apple, arguing that the EC is trying to become the world\u2019s tax police officer.",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct: global pension funds to vote against Mike Ashley re-election", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Three of the world\u2019s largest pension funds have joined the campaign for change at the top of Sports Direct by voting against the re-election of the chairman, Keith Hellawell, and founder, Mike Ashley. Proxy voting disclosures for CalPERs and CALSTRS \u2013 the largest public pension funds in the US \u2013 and the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan (OTTP) reveal all three plan to support a trade union-backed resolution calling for an independent review of labour practices at the retail group, in the wake of a critical parliamentary report and an investigation by the Guardian. Public pressure on Sports Direct is increasing ahead of its annual shareholder meeting on 7 September with campaigners from War on Want planning demonstrations outside 15 stores around the country on Saturday. The OTPP said it was voting against the reappointment of Ashley as executive deputy chairman and Hellawell given the \u201csignificant failings in the company\u2019s human capital management practices\u201d revealed by the business innovation and skills committee report and a separate investigation by HMRC into the underpayment of workers on minimum wage. \u201cAfter reviewing the report, we have concerns over the role played by Mr Ashley in this situation and have lost confidence in his ability to represent the interests of all shareholders,\u201d it said. The pension fund had lost confidence in Hellawell\u2019s ability to \u201censure the board\u2019s oversight role is discharged effectively\u201d. All three pension funds are voting against the reappointment of the retail group\u2019s auditor, Grant Thornton, and a number of other directors. Both CalSTERS and CalPERs are voting against the reappointment of the chief executive, Dave Forsey, and the acting chief financial officer, Matthew Pearson, while OTPP and CALSTRS will vote against the reappointment of Simon Bentley, the non-executive director who heads Sports Direct\u2019s audit committee. The North American funds own less than 1% of Sports Directs\u2019 stock between them, according to Reuters, but their action will add to pressure for an overhaul of the board and employment practices from a string of British shareholder groups. Legal &amp; General Investment Management said last week it would be voting against the re-election of all Sports Direct\u2019s non-executive directors, including Hellawell, against whom it has voted for the past two years. Aberdeen Asset Management said it would vote against the re-appointment of Hellawell, as well as Forsey and Matt Pearson. Both are backing the trade union resolution. The Investor Forum, a shareholder group with combined assets of \u00a314.5tn, has increased pressure on Sports Direct by criticising the retailer\u2019s corporate governance failings. The group said it did not regard a review of employment practices being carried out by RPC, Sports Direct\u2019s lawyers, as independent, echoing the views of other shareholders. Janet Williamson, a senior policy officer at the TUC, the trade union umbrella body, and the chair of Trade Union Share Owners, said: \u201cTrade Union Share Owners is very pleased with the support we are getting from investors for our resolution calling for the board of Sports Direct to commission an independent report on human capital practices and report back within six months. \u201cSports Direct\u2019s treatment of its staff has damaged its relationship not only with its workforce but with its investors. We hope that investors\u2019 support for this resolution will encourage the company to think again.\u201d For the first time this year, independent shareholders will hold real sway at Sports Direct\u2019s AGM, because of new regulatory rules governing companies that have a controlling shareholder with a stake of 30% or more. In the past, Ashley, who owns a 55% stake, was able to outvote any detractors. But now the election of non-executive directors, such as Hellawell, must be approved separately by minority shareholders. To go against their wishes, Sports Direct would be forced to hold another vote between three and six months later. While Ashley could outvote minority shareholders at that point, such a move would be highly contentious. In an effort to win over its critics, Sports Direct announced earlier this week that it would open its doors to the public on the day of the AGM, held in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. Directors will answer questions and take visitors on a tour of the site, including the warehouse. In July, it was announced that thousands of warehouse workers would receive back pay totalling about \u00a31m after the retailer admitted breaking the law by not paying the national minimum wage. A Guardian investigation last year exposed the fact that Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the legal requirement. The company and the employment agencies it uses face fines of up to \u00a32m.",

    "webTitle": "Apple tax: European commissioner defends \u20ac13bn ruling", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, has defended her \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) ruling against Apple\u2019s Irish tax affairs, hitting back at claims made by a predecessor that EU state aid laws should not be used to fight sweetheart tax deals. Vestager made clear the rationale for the Apple ruling following comments by Neelie Kroes, who said on Thursday that EU member states have a sovereign right to determine their own tax laws. Kroes served as competition commissioner between 2004 and 2010. Speaking at a tax conference in Copenhagen on Friday, Vestager said: \u201cGiving a specific tax treatment to a particular company gives that company a benefit just as surely as if it had been handed a bundle of cash. So the state aid rules apply to tax exemption just as much as to any other type of aid.\u201d Historically, Brussels competition officials have only used state aid powers in limited circumstances, which have not involved private tax deals awarded by member states to multinationals. The European commission only began using these powers to investigate suspected sweetheart tax deals \u2013 including Apple\u2019s agreements with Ireland \u2013 in 2014, under Kroes\u2019s successor Joaqu\u00edn Almunia. Many tax experts had not anticipated such tax deals would be scrutinised by Brussels as corporate tax has for years been widely considered a sovereign matter for member states. But Vestager insisted she and Almunia had not moved the goal posts. \u201cThis is not new,\u201d she said. \u201cThe state aid rules applied since 1958. They are laid down in the treaty and ratified by parliaments in each and every member state. \u201cIt\u2019s never been a secret that tax exemptions could be state aid, and that if so, they\u2019d have to be paid back. The only secret was the tax rulings themselves.\u201d She pointed out that Brussels gave guidance to member states as long ago as 1998, warning them how tax deals to big businesses might, in some circumstances, risk being classed as state aid. There was also European case law on the treatment of sweetheart tax deals and state aid. Also on Friday morning, the European commission\u2019s chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, separately gave another critical response to Kroes\u2019s remarks at a press conference in Brussels. \u201cWe understand it may sometimes be challenging to reconcile the role [held by Kroes] as a former commissioner with the temptation to publicly express the views of those \u2013 in Silicon Valley or elsewhere - who oppose the commission\u2019s decisions,\u201d he said. Schinas\u2019s words appear to have been a thinly veiled reference to the fact that Kroes was appointed to the advisory board of taxi-hailing app group Uber Technologies in May. Uber is based in Silicon Valley and has set up complex tax structures in Europe. The extent to which private tax deals were being handed out to big multinationals by some European countries was laid bare by the 2014 LuxLeaks scandal. Hundreds of leaked tax deals awarded to large international businesses by Luxmebourg\u2019s tax office revealed companies were able to exploit legal loopholes and access tax rates as low as 1%. In the case of Apple, vital financial revelations came from a 2013 inquiry into the iPhone maker\u2019s tax affairs by the US Senate\u2019s subcommittee on investigations, then chaired by Carl Levin. For may years, Apple had used unorthodox corporate arrangements to ensure it did not have to file publicly available accounts for its Irish subsidiaries, making scrutiny harder. Speaking in Copenhagen, Vestager said: \u201cI am often asked why it took so long for us to start investigating tax rulings that go back to the 90s. The answer is that, for a very long time, fiscal secrecy prevailed over transparency.\u201d Earlier this week, she announced Apple\u2019s tax deals in Ireland were so generous as to amount to illegal state aid. Billions of dollars of income had been flowing through Apple subsidiaries in Cork, attracting tax rates of a fraction of 1%. As a result, the commission ordered Ireland to bill Apple for \u20ac13bn in back taxes, plus interest. Apple has said it will appeal against the decision. Ireland is also considering a legal challenge.",

    "webTitle": "US jobs report: economy added 151,000 jobs in August, fewer than expected", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The prospect of an interest rate rise in the US has receded after news that the world\u2019s largest economy suffered a lull in job creation last month. There were 151,000 jobs added to the US economy in August, below economists\u2019 forecasts for 180,000 and a marked slowdown after two bumper months of growth. Figures from the Department of Labor also showed wage growth slowed and the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.9%, defying expectations for it to edge down in August. The US Federal Reserve has hinted at a rate rise before the end of this year, with some economists saying ahead of the latest job figures that a move could come at central bank\u2019s meeting later this month. But the Fed chair, Janet Yellen, has also said she and fellow policymakers would watch the economic data closely. As a result, analysts said the weaker jobs number would probably keep interest rates on hold for now. \u201cThe data-dependent Fed will most likely see the payroll numbers as taking pressure off any immediate need to hike interest rates, significantly reducing the scope for further policy action in September,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit. Investor expectations that the Fed will now hold off raising rates in September buoyed stock markets in the US and Europe. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose sharply after the jobs news but ended the day up 72 points (0.39%). The FTSE 100 of big UK-listed stocks ended the day up 2.2% at 6894.60, lifted by brighter news on Britain\u2019s economy this week. The August slowdown in US jobs creation follows stronger performances in June and July when a combined 546,000 jobs were added. That apparent strength had fanned market expectations of another move from the Fed to get interest rates back to more normal levels after the financial crisis ushered in years of record low borrowing costs. The Fed last raised borrowing costs in December 2015, the first such move in almost a decade, bringing the interest rate range to 0.25%-0.5%. Since then it has held off any further moves amid low inflation and mixed news on the US economy. Policymakers have also highlighted worries about the global outlook and the possible repercussions of the UK vote to leave the EU. A report this week suggesting US manufacturing shrank in August added to the mood of caution around the economic outlook but many economists still see a rate rise in December as likely. The US central bank is also closely watching wage growth, which slowed in August, according to the latest figures. Average hourly earnings were up 0.1% in August after a 0.3% rise in July. Economists at Fathom Consulting said the \u201clukewarm\u201d payrolls report left rate-setters at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) with a dilemma. \u201cIn order to be \u2018reasonably confident\u2019 that inflation will return to target, average hourly earnings will need to rise by more than 0.1% each month, as they did between July and August,\u201d they wrote in a research note. At the same time, the slowdown in jobs creation at this point in the recovery was widely expected and the Fed will not be overly concerned about the August figure, economists said. The Fathom note continued: \u201cAlthough just 151,000 net payrolls were added in August, less than expected, the underlying rate of job creation is still well above the level required for the labour market to tighten. We stick to our view that the FOMC will increase rates once this year \u2013 though December now looks most likely \u2013 and at least twice in 2017.\u201d The detail of the jobs report showed food services was the biggest growth area, adding 34,000 new jobs. The report once again highlighted the racial disparity in the jobs market. Unemployment for African Americans stood at 8.1%, with white people at 4.4%. The US labor force participation rate, the percentage of the US population in the workforce or actively seeking a job, remained unchanged at 62.8%. Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said the latest payrolls report meant the Fed should hold fire. \u201cAugust\u2019s payroll number is weak tea \u2013 we need to have stronger job growth for a more sustained period before we can say we\u2019re at full employment,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the last jobs report before the Federal Reserve meets and potentially raises rates. They should hold steady, and let the economy to steep a little longer, so the recovery can reach the most distressed communities.\u201d The FOMC will next meet on 20 and 21 September. However, not everyone believes it should wait to raise rates. \u201cI think they should hike in September,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. Zandi expected the US economy to add 150,000 jobs in September. \u201cI think they\u2019re running the risk that the longer they wait to normalise rates, the greater the odds that the economy overheats.\u201d",

But the Fed chair, Janet Yellen, has also said she and fellow policymakers would watch the economic data closely. As a result, analysts said the weaker jobs number would probably keep interest rates on hold for now.</p> <p>\u201cThe data-dependent Fed will most likely see the payroll numbers as taking pressure off any immediate need to hike interest rates, significantly reducing the scope for further policy action in September,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit.</p> <p>Investor expectations that the Fed will now hold off raising rates in September buoyed stock markets in the US and Europe. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose sharply after the jobs news but ended the day up 72 points (0.39%). The FTSE 100 of big UK-listed stocks ended the day up 2.2% at 6894.60, lifted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/sep/02/ftse-climbs-on-uk-construction-news-ahead-of-us-jobs-but-bt-drops\">brighter news on Britain\u2019s economy this week</a>.</p> <p>The August slowdown in US jobs creation follows stronger performances in June and July when a combined 546,000 jobs were added. That apparent strength had fanned market expectations of another move from the Fed to get interest rates back to more normal levels after the financial crisis ushered in years of record low borrowing costs. </p> <p>The Fed last raised borrowing costs in December 2015, the first such move in almost a decade, bringing the interest rate range to 0.25%-0.5%. Since then it has held off any further moves amid low inflation and mixed news on the US economy. Policymakers have also highlighted worries about the global outlook and the possible repercussions of the UK vote to leave the EU. </p> <p>A report this week suggesting US manufacturing shrank in August added to the mood of caution around the economic outlook but many economists still see a rate rise in December as likely.</p> <p>The US central bank is also closely watching wage growth, which slowed in August, according to the latest figures. Average hourly earnings were up 0.1% in August after a 0.3% rise in July.</p> <p>Economists at Fathom Consulting said the \u201clukewarm\u201d payrolls report left rate-setters at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) with a dilemma.</p> <p>\u201cIn order to be \u2018reasonably confident\u2019 that inflation will return to target, average hourly earnings will need to rise by more than 0.1% each month, as they did between July and August,\u201d they wrote in a research note.<br></p> <p>At the same time, the slowdown in jobs creation at this point in the recovery was widely expected and the Fed will not be overly concerned about the August figure, economists said.</p> <p>The Fathom note continued: \u201cAlthough just 151,000 net payrolls were added in August, less than expected, the underlying rate of job creation is still well above the level required for the labour market to tighten. We stick to our view that the FOMC will increase rates once this year \u2013 though December now looks most likely \u2013 and at least twice in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>The detail of the jobs report showed food services was the biggest growth area, adding 34,000 new jobs.</p> <p>The report once again highlighted the racial disparity in the jobs market. Unemployment for African Americans stood at 8.1%, with white people at 4.4%.</p> <p>The US labor force participation rate, the percentage of the US population in the workforce or actively seeking a job, remained unchanged at 62.8%.</p> <p>Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said the latest payrolls report meant the Fed should hold fire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\" data-alt=\"US interest rates\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\">US interest rates</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cAugust\u2019s payroll number is weak tea \u2013 we need to have stronger job growth for a more sustained period before we can say we\u2019re at full employment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the last jobs report before the Federal Reserve meets and potentially raises rates. They should hold steady, and let the economy to steep a little longer, so the recovery can reach the most distressed communities.\u201d</p> <p>The FOMC will next meet on 20 and 21 September. However, not everyone believes it should wait to raise rates.</p> <p>\u201cI think they should hike in September,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/31/why-the-federal-reserve-probably-will-not-like-the-nonfarm-payrolls-jobs-report-friday.html\">said Mark Zandi</a>, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. Zandi expected the US economy to add 150,000 jobs in September. \u201cI think they\u2019re running the risk that the longer they wait to normalise rates, the greater the odds that the economy overheats.\u201d</p>",

Asos has reached a global settlement with Assos of Switzerland, which makes clothing for cyclists, and Anson\u2019s Herrenhaus, a German menswear retailer. The UK retailer will pay a total of \u00a320.2m in cash to the two companies. The deal will allow Asos to start selling athletic leisurewear, a growing segment of the youth fashion market. However, Asos will be restricted from selling cyclewear and opening shops in Germany. Assos and Anson\u2019s were already both in operation when Asos changed its name from As Seen on Screen in 2002. Anson\u2019s launched its legal case in 2010 and Assos launched its in 2011 as Asos began to expand rapidly outside the UK. Assos will open it first flagship store outside Switzerland in London\u2019s West End later this year. Asos had successfully defended its case in the UK right up to the supreme court. However, there are outstanding cases in the US, France and Germany. Despite the payment, which is equal to almost six months profit for Asos, shares in the company rose 132p, or 3%, to \u00a346.94. Nick Beighton, chief executive of Asos, said: \u201cWe are pleased to have put this litigation behind us. Entering into this settlement at this juncture is the right commercial decision for our business.\u201d Asos has been involved in disputes with rival retailers before over trademark infringements, but they have tended to involve accusations that the online retailer stole the design of an individual piece of clothing. The company said there were no other intellectual property cases that could have a material impact on its finances. Analysts at Berenberg said: \u201cIntellectual property law is very complex and varies significantly by country. Asos couldn\u2019t therefore guarantee that it would win all cases in all markets and as such decided to settle the disputes.\u201d The City welcomed the settlement because of the potential disruption the legal cases could have caused and the new opportunities that could open up for Asos. Simon Bowler, analyst at Exane, added: \u201cWhilst Asos has successfully defended itself until now, there was no certainty they would be successful in these markets. Losing a case in either of these markets would force Asos to rebrand, which was a significant risk that Asos has eliminated. \u201cWhilst the \u00a320.2m cash payment is optically large, this looks to be the right commercial decision for the business in the long term. The settlement brings certainty over the end of the dispute and eliminates any further litigation risk in Asos\u2019s biggest markets. The settlement also opens up the opportunity of moving the Asos own-brand into the attractive \u2018athleisure\u2019 market.\u201d Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said: \u201cIn addition to removing a potentially large distraction, Asos will now be permitted to start selling sportswear on a global basis which they were previously unable to whilst the litigation was under way. \u201cSportswear, particularly yoga wear, gym wear, golf wear, could present a sizeable market share opportunity for Asos given its younger customer demographic and the growth we have been seeing in the premium sportswear market.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Go-Ahead, which owns Southern rail operator Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), has waived his bonus as the company reported profits of nearly \u00a3100m, despite widespread problems at Britain\u2019s busiest commuter franchise. David Brown apologised to passengers following a summer of travel misery. He said he took the decision in June to turn down his annual bonus and pay rise. \u201cIt just felt like the right thing to do,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about us, it\u2019s largely about the infrastructure.\u201d Brown is set to get paid about 40% less than last year, when his pay packet amounted to nearly \u00a32.2m. The company has also introduced passenger satisfaction measures in its annual bonus plan. Go-Ahead\u2019s 27% increase in profits infuriated unions and opposition parties. The RMT union said the company was a \u201cmoney-raking disaster\u201d. Jenny Randerson, the Liberal Democrat transport spokeswoman, said Southern was \u201ctaking the public for a ride while passengers are left fuming on platforms \u2026 When will ministers stand up to Southern and take away its franchise? This is a scandal.\u201d The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, concurred. \u201cOver the past year Southern has established itself as the standard bearer for dysfunctional privatised rail services. Passengers are enduring the worst delays in the country, fares are up 25%, and public investment to improve Southern services seems a long way off.\u201d Commuters have suffered months of travel chaos amid the company\u2019s bitter disputes with unions and staff shortages. Southern introduced an emergency timetable in July and blamed \u201cunprecedented\u201d levels of staff sickness, but will on Monday restore more than one-third of the 341 daily services previously cut. Brown said the goal was to have all services back by the end of October. Statutory profits before tax at Go-Ahead rose to \u00a399.8m in the year to 2 July, with revenues up by 4.5% to \u00a33.4bn. The company\u2019s main bus division had a record year, while Southern\u2019s operating company, GTR, made a single-figure million loss and will remain in the red this year and next. Brown said the group was subsidising the GTR franchise, adding: \u201cThere is no profit at the expense of Southern commuters at this moment in time.\u201d But Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, asked whether Brown and the other board directors should be handing back their salaries after another year of failure. Mick Whelan, the Aslef general secretary, said: \u201cThis is like living with Alice in Wonderland. A company which has failed to deliver for passengers every day for the last year \u2013 and which only yesterday got its snout back in the public trough with another generous pile of taxpayers\u2019 cash, courtesy of a compliant DfT [Department for Transport] \u2013 has just announced record profits for its shareholders.\u201d The results came a day after the government announced a \u00a320m fund and a new review board to improve Southern\u2019s services and restore confidence in the franchise. Govia is a joint venture between Go-Ahead, which owns 65%, and France\u2019s Keolis, which owns 35%. Brown said: \u201cA large part of the role of the GTR franchise is to introduce three new train fleets and modernise working practices. During this period of change, Southern services have been disrupted by restricted network capacity, strike action and increased levels of absence. We apologise to the people whose lives have been affected during this time.\u201d The company was working closely with the DfT, Network Rail and others to get services back on track, he said. However, there will be more disruption if a 48-hour walkout by guards goes ahead on Wednesday and Thursday. A strike by RMT station staff over the station modernisation programme has been called off and Aslef suspended a ballot for strike action, which could have coincided with the RMT strikes. Brown rejected criticism from RMT that the government had \u201cpropped up Southern with yet another \u00a320m of taxpayers cash,\u201d while the company could fund improvements itself. \u201cThis is not subsidising a private company,\u201d Brown said, adding that the \u00a320m would go into infrastructure and Network Rail would be the custodian. Govia has been at loggerheads with unions over the use of more driver-only trains and the role of guards. Brown said staff sickness levels had quadrupled at the time of the first dispute in April. The independent Rail Safety and Standards Board found that the new breed of driver-only trains with CCTV could improve safety, rather than reduce it, as claimed by the unions, the Go-Ahead boss said. He said the company had been careful in introducing changes and new technology, there would be no job losses and pay and conditions were guaranteed. The use of driver-only trains is becoming standard and the role of guards will become non-existent in the future, he said. Forty per cent of Southern trains are driver only, with drivers relying on CCTV rather than guards before shutting the doors. But the RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cJust a fraction of these profits would be enough to keep the guards on Southern trains, keep the passengers safe and resolve the industrial dispute between RMT and the company. It is shameful that they have opted to hoard cash instead of protecting the travelling public.\u201d Brown said the \u00a36.5bn Thameslink programme, which comes after 40% passenger growth on Southern over the past five years, would deliver gradual improvements during the next two years. GTR\u2019s losses were offset by a strong performance at Southeastern and London Midland. The contribution of Go-Ahead\u2019s rail division to the DfT was \u00a3222m last year. Southern is the UK\u2019s largest rail franchise, covering routes from Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and Kent into London. It also runs Gatwick Express services. GTR operates the Thameslink and Great Northern rail companies. Its parent company, Govia, runs London Midland and Southeastern and has been shortlisted for the West Midlands franchise.",

Passengers are enduring the worst delays in the country, fares are up 25%, and public investment to improve Southern services seems a long way off.\u201d</p> <p>Commuters have suffered months of travel chaos amid the company\u2019s bitter disputes with unions and staff shortages. Southern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/05/southern-apologises-axes-341-trains-day-new-timetable\">introduced an emergency timetable</a> in July and blamed \u201cunprecedented\u201d levels of staff sickness, but will on Monday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/30/southern-rail-to-reinstate-119-train-services\">restore more than one-third</a> of the 341 daily services previously cut. Brown said the goal was to have all services back by the end of October.</p> <p>Statutory profits before tax at Go-Ahead rose to \u00a399.8m in the year to 2 July, with revenues up by 4.5% to \u00a33.4bn. The company\u2019s main bus division had a record year, while Southern\u2019s operating company, GTR, made a single-figure million loss and will remain in the red this year and next.</p> <p>Brown said the group was subsidising the GTR franchise, adding: \u201cThere is no profit at the expense of Southern commuters at this moment in time.\u201d</p> <p>But Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, asked whether Brown and the other board directors should be handing back their salaries after another year of failure. </p> <p>Mick Whelan, the Aslef general secretary, said: \u201cThis is like living with Alice in Wonderland. A company which has failed to deliver for passengers every day for the last year \u2013 and which only yesterday got its snout back in the public trough with another generous pile of taxpayers\u2019 cash, courtesy of a compliant DfT [Department for Transport] \u2013 has just announced record profits for its shareholders.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/sep/02/morning-commute-on-southern-rail-live\">'The service is completely useless': commuters react to Southern rail profit hike - live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The results came a day after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/01/southern-rail-crisis-20m-fund-announced-to-tackle-problems\">government announced a \u00a320m fund</a> and a new review board to improve Southern\u2019s services and restore confidence in the franchise. Govia is a joint venture between Go-Ahead, which owns 65%, and France\u2019s Keolis, which owns 35%.</p> <p>Brown said: \u201cA large part of the role of the GTR franchise is to introduce three new train fleets and modernise working practices. During this period of change, Southern services have been disrupted by restricted network capacity, strike action and increased levels of absence. We apologise to the people whose lives have been affected during this time.\u201d</p> <p>The company was working closely with the DfT, Network Rail and others to get services back on track, he said.</p> <p>However, there will be more disruption if a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/23/southern-rail-staff-to-stage-48-hour-strike-over-role-of-guards\">48-hour walkout by guards</a> goes ahead on Wednesday and Thursday. A strike by RMT station staff over the station modernisation programme has been called off and Aslef suspended a ballot for strike action, which could have coincided with the RMT strikes.</p> <p>Brown rejected criticism from RMT that the government had \u201cpropped up Southern with yet another \u00a320m of taxpayers cash,\u201d while the company could fund improvements itself. </p> <p>\u201cThis is not subsidising a private company,\u201d Brown said, adding that the \u00a320m would go into infrastructure and Network Rail would be the custodian.</p> <p>Govia has been at loggerheads with unions over the use of more driver-only trains and the role of guards. Brown said staff sickness levels had quadrupled at the time of the first dispute in April.<br></p> <p>The independent Rail Safety and Standards Board found that the<em> </em>new breed of driver-only trains with CCTV could improve safety, rather than reduce it, as claimed by the unions, the Go-Ahead boss said. He said the company had been careful in introducing changes and new technology, there would be no job losses and pay and conditions were guaranteed.</p> <p>The use of driver-only trains is becoming standard and the role of guards will become non-existent in the future, he said. Forty per cent of Southern trains are driver only, with drivers relying on CCTV rather than guards before shutting the doors.</p> <p>But the RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cJust a fraction of these profits would be enough to keep the guards on Southern trains, keep the passengers safe and resolve the industrial dispute between RMT and the company. It is shameful that they have opted to hoard cash instead of protecting the travelling public.\u201d</p> <p>Brown said the \u00a36.5bn Thameslink programme, which comes after 40% passenger growth on Southern over the past five years, would deliver gradual improvements during the next two years.</p> <p>GTR\u2019s losses were offset by a strong performance at Southeastern and London Midland. The contribution of Go-Ahead\u2019s rail division to the DfT was \u00a3222m last year.</p> <p>Southern is the UK\u2019s largest rail franchise, covering routes from Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and Kent into London. It also runs Gatwick Express services. GTR <a href=\"http://www.southernrailway.com/southern/company-info/integration/\">operates the Thameslink and Great Northern</a> rail companies. <a href=\"http://www.govia.info/\">Its parent company, Govia</a>, runs London Midland and Southeastern and has been shortlisted for the West Midlands franchise.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a figure that could have you reaching for an EpiPen, assuming you can afford one: one billion dollars. That\u2019s how much additional revenue the Institute for Policy Studies calculates the federal government might have collected over a four-year period if it weren\u2019t for a pesky loophole that allows US corporations to deduct performance-based compensation from what they have to pay in corporate taxes each year. The just-released study comes amid the latest example of how basic salary on share price performance leads to bad decisions that have negative effects on society at large: Mylan, the drug company whose decision to hike the price of the lifesaving EpiPen has triggered a sky-high share price and a massive pay day for its CEO, Heather Bresch. The IPS\u2019s report is the latest in a series devoted to excessive executive compensation and wealth inequality, the research firm takes aim at the loophole as it relates to Wall Street\u2019s banks. The top 20 banks forked over more than $2bn in performance-related bonus payments to each of their top five executives between 2012 and 2015, IPS says. Between the financial crisis and up until 2012, those banks weren\u2019t allowed to take advantage of the loophole. As part of a widespread attempt to rein in the worst of the compensation practices that contributed to the crisis, Congress imposed a raft of new restrictions and rules governing pay at the banks as long as they still owed money borrowed under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp). Once those Tarp funds were repaid, the banks were free to dole out performance-based bonuses once more \u2013 and they rushed to do so. The study notes that the share of vested stock paid out as bonuses to the top five bank employees at the banks it studied rose from about 5% (when they were still under Tarp oversight) to 50% today. The Institute for Policy Studies uses the banks as a case study in arguing for the demolition of the executive pay bonus loophole. Their broad argument couldn\u2019t be more accurate or more timely. We need to revive the debate about all the wrongs committed in the name of delivering value to shareholders, and performance-based compensation is the tip of that particular iceberg. The pursuit of shareholder value has become a cult devoted to delivering maximum profits to shareholders, at all costs. Just look at how Mylan Pharmaceuticals has responded to the virtual evaporation of competitors to its lifesaving EpiPens by raising the price it charges for the auto-injector pens (which treat deadly allergic reactions to bee stings and food allergies) from $50 apiece to $600 for a two-pack over the course of eight years. Just why on earth did Mylan do this? Well, it could. It has a virtual monopoly on a critical product \u2013 one that millions of people with an allergy rely on. There\u2019s a bonus: the active ingredient, epinephrine, degrades rapidly, so they need to buy new EpiPens every year. Mylan blames the insurance industry \u2013 a convenient scapegoat. Consumers were never supposed to pick up the full price tag: if insurers aren\u2019t paying, that\u2019s because the Affordable Care Act has left the health insurance system in a mess, distorting drug pricing. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that EpiPen price increases began before the Obama administration\u2019s healthcare law was put in place, and that in Canada\u2019s single-payer insurance market, people suffering from allergies can pick up an EpiPen two-pack for less than $100. Of course, in Canada, it\u2019s not Mylan that sets the price, but Pfizer, which has licensed the injectable medication from Mylan. Let\u2019s circle back to the pesky question of what it is that motivates CEOs like Bresch, why they make decisions like this and what they conceive their responsibilities to be. Since the summer of 2007, the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has climbed 47%, while Mylan\u2019s shares have outperformed dramatically, soaring 178%. And yes, you-betcha, Bresch has benefited from some of that same performance-linked compensation. Not only has it deprived the taxpayer of potential income, but it has rewarded Bresch for doing something that is just as clearly against the public interest just as leveraging the banking system to the hilt was in the run-up to the financial crisis in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Bresch clearly should have been rewarded for savvy marketing that made EpiPen a \u201cmust have\u201d item in schools, airplanes and theme parks. But should Bresch have been rewarded so lavishly simply for being able to hike those prices and profit from the fact that Mylan had no viable rivals? It wasn\u2019t as if the company was being rewarded for years of costly research and development. On the contrary; about half of its revenue was pure profit. And a lot of that went to pay Bresch\u2019s increasingly lavish compensation package, which rose at an even faster clip than did EpiPen\u2019s price. In 2007, Bresch pocketed $2.45m; in 2015, her compensation totaled nearly $19m. In whose interests are companies like Mylan and the Wall Street banks being run? The basic argument \u2013 based on law that dates to the early 20th century, when Henry Ford\u2019s shareholders sued him for trying to make cars more affordable to customers \u2013 is that a company has a fiduciary duty to maximize profits for its investors. It has been seized on, amplified and raised to the status of holy writ by short-term thinkers among those on Wall Street. The result? Publicly traded businesses, fearful of being pummeled by hedge fund investors, end up increasingly detached from the realities of the real world. They reward CEOs lavishly for delivering outsize profits and big stock price gains, even if that is done by keeping wages and salaries for employees at rock bottom levels. That\u2019s how we end up with firms like Walmart and McDonald\u2019s ostensibly employing people full time, who still rely on various forms of government assistance to keep them above the poverty line. Doing away with tax deductibility for performance-based compensation, as the Institute for Policy Studies suggests, would be a great start. At a stroke, there would be one less incentive for companies to give outsize rewards that are geared exclusively to a measure of performance that may not be in everyone\u2019s interest. As the financial crisis should have taught us, a boom in a company\u2019s profits and a run-up in the company\u2019s stock price as a result, isn\u2019t always an unquestioned good thing. Making performance-based pay more costly to a company might force the board\u2019s compensation committee to think more critically about the criteria that they\u2019re using. The real value of the IPS report isn\u2019t in the fine details like how many dollars might have flowed into the US Treasury (much less how many teachers\u2019 jobs might have been funded as a result \u2013 as if government budgets worked that smoothly \u2026). Rather, it has drawn attention to the crucial issue of performance-based compensation and the pesky questions that underpin it. If, as some legal scholars suggest, it\u2019s possible for companies to go beyond the narrow, toxic pursuit of maximizing profits and think about what is good for their employees, consider their customers, take the environment into consideration and pursue innovation, then the debate about how we get from here to there has to start somewhere. Performance-based compensation is a logical point.",

However, we are encouraged by the fact that in the 18 months to the end of June 2016 (i.e. since Virgin Media started expanding its network), Openreach lines in service increased by around 51,000 even though Virgina\u2019s network footprint expanded by 428,000. [On convergence] we think Openreach will not be split from BT mainly because: (i) Ofcom is wary of a split causing BT\u2019s Pension Trustee to demand significant extra top-up payments; (ii) a split will seriously delay building Britain better fixed broadband infrastructure. Separately, stung by all the calls for better broadband connectivity, Ofcom says it wants someone other than BT and Virgin Media to build fibre to a sizeable proportion of Britain in the next few years (the regulator thinks 40% of the UK is a good target). Ofcom has repeatedly said this is as important as reforming Openreach. The \u2018carrot\u2019 for would-be investors is easier access to BT\u2019s ducts and poles.

      "bodyText": "Construction activity recovered in August, reversing most of the slump seen in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Output fell for a third month, but the pace of decline slowed markedly. The construction PMI (pdf) from Markit/CIPS jumped to 49.2 in August from 45.9 in July. The reading was better than the 46.1 figure expected by City economists. The 50 mark separates growth from contraction: anything below indicates contraction. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit and author of the Markit/CIPS Construction PMI, said: \u201cThe downturn in UK construction activity has eased considerably since July, primarily helped by a much slower decline in commercial building. Construction firms cited a nascent recovery in client confidence since the EU referendum result and a relatively steady flow of invitations to tender in August. \u201cHowever, the latest survey indicates only a partial move towards stabilisation, rather than a return to business as usual across the construction sector. There were still widespread reports that Brexit uncertainty had dampened demand and slowed progress on planned developments, especially in relation to large projects.\u201d New order volumes continued to fall during August, which contrasts with the three-year run of sustained growth seen before May. Mike Chappell, of Lloyds Bank commercial banking, said: \u201cThe past month has seen a number of the bigger players in the sector report robust results with a relatively upbeat outlook, suggesting there may have been less negative impact from the EU referendum result than was originally feared, at least at the top of the market. \u201cThe order books of larger firms, many of which benefit from diversified revenue streams, appear to be in good shape, while several have either increased or restored their dividends. That said, anecdotal evidence indicates those further down the chain \u2013 such as mid-tier contractors and SMEs \u2013 are less bullish and more likely to adopt a \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 approach.\u201d Chappell said businesses would be following closely the various data to better gauge the health of the economy. \u201cFirms are also thinking about the chancellor\u2019s upcoming autumn statement when they will learn whether their hopes of an increase in infrastructure spending are to become a reality.\u201d The improvement in construction comes a day after the equivalent survey for manufacturing showed a strong bounceback in factory output and new orders in August, suggesting manufacturers quickly shrugged off the shock of the Brexit vote in June. Consumer confidence also recovered somewhat last month after taking a huge plunge in July, according to market researchers GfK. The Bank of England took action in early August to restore confidence among businesses and households and ward off a recession. It cut interest rates to a new record low of 0.25% and expanded its programme of bond purchases.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The bankruptcy of the Hanjin shipping line has thrown ports and retailers around the world into confusion, with giant container ships marooned and merchants worrying whether hundreds of tonnes of goods being carried by the South Korean company will reach shelves. The company filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday and stopped accepting new cargo. With its assets frozen, ships were refused permission to offload or take aboard containers because there were no guarantees that tugboat pilots or stevedores would be paid. Hanjin is the world\u2019s seventh-largest container shipper and the news left cargo headed to and from Asia in limbo. There were reports that some Hanjin ships had been seized in China on behalf of creditors. Seeking to contain the fallout, a South Korean court said it would begin proceedings to rehabilitate the carrier \u2013 which would allow Hanjin to take legal action in other countries to keep its ships and other assets from being seized. But the court action was seen as mainly procedural and an eventual liquidation of assets was likely, analysts and industry officials said. \u201cUnlike dry cargo, liner shipping is all about marketing and service reliability \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen any large carriers come back from collapse,\u201d said Rahul Kapoor, a director at maritime consultancy Drewry Financial Research Services. \u201cThere is a loss of faith among customers. It\u2019s very unlikely Hanjin can come back from the ashes.\u201d Hanjin\u2019s banks decided to end financial support for the shipper this week and many of its vessels were denied entry to ports or left unable to dock as container lashing providers worried they would not be paid. This included the port of Busan, South Korea\u2019s largest. The Korea International Trade Association said on Thursday that about 10 Hanjin vessels in China have been either seized or were expected to seized by charterers, port authorities or other parties. That adds to one other ship seized in Singapore by a creditor earlier in the week. The collapse comes at a time of high seasonal demand for the shipping industry ahead of the year-end holidays. In the US, at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation\u2019s busiest port complex, three Hanjin container ships, ranging from about 700 feet to 1,100 feet long, were either sitting offshore or anchored away from terminals on Thursday. A fourth vessel that was supposed to leave Long Beach on Thursday morning remained anchored inside the breakwater. The National Retail Federation, the world\u2019s largest retail trade association, wrote to the US secretary of commerce, Penny Pritzker, and the Federal Maritime Commission chairman, Mario Cordero, on Thursday, urging them to work with the South Korean government, ports and others to prevent disruption. Hanjin represents nearly 8% of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the US market and the bankruptcy was having \u201ca ripple effect throughout the global supply chain\u201d that could cause significant harm to both consumers and the US economy, the association wrote. \u201cRetailers\u2019 main concern is that there [are] millions of dollars\u2019 worth of merchandise that needs to be on store shelves that could be impacted by this,\u201d said Jonathan Gold, the group\u2019s vice president for supply chain and customs policy. \u201cSome of it is sitting in Asia waiting to be loaded on ships, some is already aboard ships out on the ocean and some is sitting on US docks waiting to be picked up. It is understandable that port terminal operators, railroads, trucking companies and others don\u2019t want to do work for Hanjin if they are concerned they won\u2019t get paid.\u201d Hanjin has been losing money for years and filed for bankruptcy protection a day after its creditors, led by a state-run bank, refused to prop it up. Other shipping lines were moving to take over some of the Hanjin traffic but at a price, with vessels already are operating at high capacity because of the season. The price of shipping a 40ft container from China to the US jumped by up to 50% in a single day, said Nerijus Poskus, director of pricing and procurement for Flexport, a licensed freight forwarder and customs broker based in San Francisco, who predicted the higher prices would last a month or two. The price from China to west coast ports rose from $1,100 per container to as much as $1,700 on Thursday, while the cost from China to the East Coast jumped from $1,700 to $2,400, he said. Hanjin\u2019s bankruptcy was a major factor, he said, although prices also were affected by an upcoming Chinese national holiday, Golden Week, that would close factories, and by shipping lines sidelining vessels to reduce overcapacity. A weakened economy since the 2008 recession hurt global demand and trade at the same time that steamship lines continued to build more and larger vessels \u2014 immense ships that were conceived as cost-effective when freight costs were higher several years ago. The weaker trade and overcapacity has sent ocean shipping rates plunging in recent years. With Reuters and the Associated Press",

A fourth vessel that was supposed to leave Long Beach on Thursday morning remained anchored inside the breakwater.</p> <p>The National Retail Federation, the world\u2019s largest retail trade association, wrote to the US secretary of commerce, Penny Pritzker, and the Federal Maritime Commission chairman, Mario Cordero, on Thursday, urging them to work with the South Korean government, ports and others to prevent disruption.<br></p> <p>Hanjin represents nearly 8% of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the US market and the bankruptcy was having \u201ca ripple effect throughout the global supply chain\u201d that could cause significant harm to both consumers and the US economy, the association wrote.</p> <p>\u201cRetailers\u2019 main concern is that there [are] millions of dollars\u2019 worth of merchandise that needs to be on store shelves that could be impacted by this,\u201d said Jonathan Gold, the group\u2019s vice president for supply chain and customs policy. \u201cSome of it is sitting in Asia waiting to be loaded on ships, some is already aboard ships out on the ocean and some is sitting on US docks waiting to be picked up. It is understandable that port terminal operators, railroads, trucking companies and others don\u2019t want to do work for Hanjin if they are concerned they won\u2019t get paid.\u201d</p> <p>Hanjin has been losing money for years and filed for bankruptcy protection a day after its creditors, led by a state-run bank, refused to prop it up.</p> <p>Other shipping lines were moving to take over some of the Hanjin traffic but at a price, with vessels already are operating at high capacity because of the season. The price of shipping a 40ft container from China to the US jumped by up to 50% in a single day, said Nerijus Poskus, director of pricing and procurement for Flexport, a licensed freight forwarder and customs broker based in San Francisco, who predicted the higher prices would last a month or two.</p> <p>The price from China to west coast ports rose from $1,100 per container to as much as $1,700 on Thursday, while the cost from China to the East Coast jumped from $1,700 to $2,400, he said.</p> <p>Hanjin\u2019s bankruptcy was a major factor, he said, although prices also were affected by an upcoming Chinese national holiday, Golden Week, that would close factories, and by shipping lines sidelining vessels to reduce overcapacity.</p> <p>A weakened economy since the 2008 recession hurt global demand and trade at the same time that steamship lines continued to build more and larger vessels \u2014 immense ships that were conceived as cost-effective when freight costs were higher several years ago.</p> <p>The weaker trade and overcapacity has sent ocean shipping rates plunging in recent years.</p> <p><em>With Reuters and the Associated Press</em></p>",
