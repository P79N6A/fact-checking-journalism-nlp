      "bodyText": "Since the Volkswagen emissions test scandal in September, it is not just the German carmaker that has suffered a blow to its image. Diesel automotive technology also faces a battle to regain public trust. There are already some signs of demand for diesel cars shrinking since VW was forced to apologise for installing \u201ccheat devices\u201d in 11 million vehicles. In Germany, Europe\u2019s largest car market, demand for diesel cars was down 11% by the end of October compared with the average level this year, according to data from car buying website MeinAuto. The decline for VW diesel cars was even steeper, down 14%. \u201cThe slump in demand has surprised us,\u201d said MeinAuto\u2019s managing director, Alexander Brugge. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that it\u2019s not only VW customers who are reluctant to buy diesel vehicles but customers of other brands, too.\u201d In the UK, official registration numbers of for diesel cars seem to be holding up. Diesel made up 51% of new car sales in both October and November, according to Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). That is in line with last year and above this year\u2019s average of 48%. However, there could still be a decline, because of the three-month wait between car order and delivery. VW chief executive Matthias M\u00fcller has promised that the company will increase spending on alternative technologies such as electric and hybrid vehicles by \u20ac100m next year. Audi, VW\u2019s premium brand, has also admitted that it had not informed US authorities properly about emissions-control software in its diesel cars, and estimates the cost of fixing this problem at \u201cmid-double-digit millions of euros\u201d. Over the past two decades sales of diesel cars across Europe have been boosted by tax incentives. In 2001, for example, then Labour chancellor Gordon Brown introduced a UK tax break for diesel cars on the grounds that they emitted less CO2 than petrol cars \u2013 though it is now known that diesels emit other harmful pollutants, known as nitrogen oxides. The results of those incentives have been spectacular: in 1990, diesel cars made up only 14% of new sales in 18 European countries (according to data gathered by the industry group ACEA). By 2000, diesel\u2019s European market share had jumped to 32%, with 4.7m new cars registered, and by the end of last year diesel cars accounted for 53% of sales, or 6.4m new registrations. Outside Europe, diesel is far less popular. In the US, just 3% of car sales were diesel last year, and just 2% and 1% respectively in Japan and China. \u201cOver the past years, policy initiated by the EU institutions has focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said an ACEA spokesperson. \u201cThe European automobile industry\u2019s success in reducing CO2 emissions has been, to a greater extent, dependent on higher sales of cars with diesel engines, since they emit 15-20% less CO2 on average than comparable petrol engines.\u201d But diesel cars are a major cause of high levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) \u2013 gases linked to respiratory problems and now the subject of increasing political interest around the globe. All but two of London\u2019s boroughs exceed EU limits for nitrogen dioxide, and the mayor of Paris has announced that diesel cars will be banned from the French capital by 2020 in order to reduce pollution. In the light of the VW scandal, which has been called the car industry\u2019s \u201cLibor moment\u201d, industry experts expect diesel\u2019s share of the European market to decline. Management consultancy Roland Berger reckons it will be down to 41% by 2030. But the decline could be far sharper: in the consultancy\u2019s worst-case scenario, the percentage of diesel cars hitting the road every year drops to 10%. \u201cIt is hard, but it is possible to make diesel clean, even under the new real drive test conditions,\u201d said Roland Berger\u2019s car industry expert, Thomas Schlick. EU member states recently agreed to more realistic testing conditions, and additional combustion and after-treatment technologies could add up to \u20ac3,000 to the cost of a car, the consultancy estimates. Among higher-priced cars, said Schlick, that would be \u201cmanageable\u201d, but in the smaller car market, diesel engines were likely to lose their attraction. Among the major motor companies, BMW has the biggest proportion of diesel cars: they account for more than 80% of its new ones. VW, with a diesel share of 56%, recently announced that the next version of its luxury Phaeton car would be electric. The company is also looking for partners to set up a battery plant in Germany, so it will be less dependant on Asian suppliers for components for electric cars. \u201cThe new testing standards will be extremely difficult for automobile manufacturers to reach in a short space of time,\u201d said the ACEA. \u201cAs a direct consequence, a substantial number of diesel models will have to be phased out earlier than planned.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Barriers to becoming self-employed are holding back thousands of people who would love to work for themselves, according to a new report. Fewer than half of those who aspire to be self-employed are able to achieve their goal, according to Citizens Advice \u2013 40% of working people would like to work for themselves but only 15% of the UK workforce is currently self-employed. The charity\u2019s report, Going Solo, warns that a dire shortage of financial resources, a lack of available help with skills, such as budgeting or business planning, and a lack of practical support with tasks, such as completing tax returns, risk creating a barrier to people fulfilling their ambition of working for themselves. It claims that potentially viable businesses are failing unnecessarily for the want of guidance in the early stages. \u201cFor some people self-employment can be a good way to manage their work life balance or a necessary step for work in their industry,\u201d said the chief executive of Citizens Advice, Gillian Guy. \u201cBut too many are unable to access the help they need to go it alone with confidence.\u201d Earnings are also falling for the self-employed. Since 2008, the average has fallen from \u00a3233 to \u00a3207 per week, compared with regular employees where median income has risen from \u00a3388 to \u00a3425 per week. On average it takes three years for a business to develop before a self-employed person earns the equivalent of the national minimum wage. At the same time those working for themselves can find it a struggle to get access to working tax credits, while the government has been accused of leaving them behind in workplace pension changes. Only one in 10 are paying into a pension fund, down from four in 10 a decade ago. Single parents are disproportionally affected as they are more likely to be self-employed than the rest of the working population \u2013 18% compared to 15% \u2013 said Fiona Weir, chief executive of the charity Gingerbread. \u201cAs universal credit is phased in, there\u2019s a real concern that the new rules will make it harder to sustain self-employment,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to see the government undertake a rapid review of self employment for those on low incomes to ensure that its support takes into consideration those who need to balance work and childcare.\u201d Since 2011 the proportion of people turning to local Citizens Advice for help who are in work and self-employed has increased by 50%. \u201cSelf-employment is increasingly a mainstream career option but it can be complicated, particularly when you\u2019re first starting out,\u201d said Guy. \u201cEnsuring the right support is on hand for newly self-employed people will go a long towards helping them make a success out of their new businesses.\u201d The charity is calling for specialist staff to be available at jobcentres to help with skills including financial planning and understanding the tax system. It also calls for more understanding of when a business has been given sufficient time to develop before cutting down tax credits.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt could be me and 10 others, or we could be 300, it\u2019s always hard to know with a march,\u201d says Chris Kitchen, secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). But Keith Poulson, the union\u2019s branch secretary at Kellingley colliery in north Yorkshire \u2013 whose closure later this month is the reason for the gathering planned for 19 December \u2013 is thinking bigger. He believes that as many as 2,000 people could attend, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the last deep coal mine\u201d. He expects a media scrum along with miners and their families, and says: \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to move for TV crews on the verge out there. If we\u2019d only had as much attention when we were trying to keep the place open, then it might have been a different tale we\u2019re telling now.\u201d There is so much bitterness here that the Kellingley miners rejected an offer by management to lay on a buffet and a brass band to mark their last day at work. Then, at a 40th birthday party a few weeks ago, two women whose partners are among the 451 men still working at Kellingley decided they would arrange something. They fixed on a march modelled on one held in January, when the local Labour and Conservative MPs Yvette Cooper and Nigel Adams joined calls for the mine \u2013 which is in Adams\u2019 constituency but so close to Cooper\u2019s that she, too, is heavily involved \u2013 to be saved. Led by the Knottingley Silver Band, and with NUM officials carrying the branch banner, the marchers will process the short distance from Knottingley town hall to the Miners\u2019 Social Club. Tickets are on sale for an event later that evening, billed as \u201cThe Last Pit Party\u201d on the poster pinned up in the concourse where the miners clock in and out, and where staff from Jobcentre Plus have set up a temporary surgery to offer advice. Poulson respected union members\u2019 wishes when he agreed that they would just walk away after the final shift. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think it was good to mark the end of the industry \u2013 you only celebrate a victory, don\u2019t you?\u201d he says. But now the two women have taken the initiative, he says he\u2019s glad. \u201cTheir energy is commendable,\u201d he adds. Most of the miners I spoke to at Kellingley this week seemed to think they would join the march \u2013 although there were plenty who declined to talk to the handful of journalists allowed in, along with a documentary film crew, to have a look around before the last of more than 50 Yorkshire coal mines is shut. Alan Clasper, a welder, says he hopes the farewells \u201cwill be upbeat, though people will be feeling disappointed. Everyone sticks together, don\u2019t they?\u201d Employment prospects are grim for this ageing workforce, some of whom have worked in mines since their teens. A good number had fathers and grandfathers who were miners, and they now face little choice but to apply for unskilled warehouse and driving jobs. A notice invites applications to the new wind-turbine factory in Hull, while pointing out that 1,000 applications were received for 14 jobs. Asked if they have enjoyed working at Kellingley, the men say they will miss the camaraderie, and there is bravado as well as anger among a group who list those they hold responsible \u2013 Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair \u2013 before one tries a joke: \u201cWe\u2019re all off on gap years, aren\u2019t we?\u201d For those closest to retirement, the prospects are better, though Poulson, who is 55, will take away just \u00a313,000 in redundancy pay after 39 years. \u201cI\u2019m hoping the young \u2019uns do get lucky,\u201d says Andy Anderson, 60, who works in the medical centre. \u201cMy son is 27, he\u2019s got a daughter and his wife\u2019s pregnant. When he started here two years ago they told him he\u2019d got 10 years\u2019 work. The young men, with kids and mortgages, they\u2019re not going to have the chance to earn the same money again.\u201d This is the last of several waves of redundancy here: 205 men left in July, and 160 last year. Pay ranges from \u00a330,000 to three times that for men working underground, with bonuses and overtime. From the yard, between the two mine shafts and the conveyor belts leading to the buildings where the coal is washed and loaded on to trains, the eight huge chimneys of Eggborough coal-fired power station are clearly visible. Less than four miles in the other direction is Ferrybridge. Both are set to close next year, long before the government\u2019s recently announced deadline for coal-fired power stations of 2025. For decades, this corner of Yorkshire has been a vital source of electricity, but asked whether people know what is about to happen here, the unanimous answer is \u201cno\u201d. \u201cYou live in London. Go and ask your next-door neighbour if they think there\u2019s any deep mines left in Britain,\u201d Poulson tells me. \u201cEveryone thinks mining is already finished,\u201d says Margaret Faull, who recently retired as director of the National Coal Mining Museum after almost 30 years. Colliery manager Shaun McLoughlin, sitting behind the desk in his office, and cable bolter Tony Chappell, in a high-vis jacket covered in black dust, tell versions of the same story: when you go on holiday and get into conversation, people can\u2019t believe you work in a mine. \u201cThey don\u2019t know that up this end of the world it\u2019s always been mining,\u201d says Chappell, who is 53. Hatfield colliery near Doncaster was expected to be the last of England\u2019s three remaining coal mines to shut, and the NUM invested \u00a34m of members\u2019 money there in the hope that state aid could further extend its life. But the doubling of the carbon floor price by chancellor George Osborne in April meant that, when the mine\u2019s contracts ended, there was no buyer, leading to its closure in June. Two weeks later, Thoresby in Nottinghamshire closed, too. No one denies British coal is expensive. Labour costs, safety standards, and issues with this mine including the three hours a day miners spend travelling underground, are among the reasons \u2013 and a contract with Drax power station is the only reason Kellingley can sell what it currently produces. Local MP Nigel Adams says, \u201cThe closure of Kellingley is a tragedy for everyone who works there,\u201d and blames \u201csuccessive governments\u2019 decarbonisation policies along with cheaper coal imports\u201d, while a spokesperson for energy secretary Amber Rudd cites the \u201csignificant role in our energy history\u201d played by Kellingley and looks ahead to \u201copportunities\u201d in nuclear and gas. McLoughlin says that, as far as politics are concerned, \u201cEverything\u2019s on the back of the environmentalists.\u201d Since the Labour governments of 1997-2010 continued with the pit closures begun by the Conservatives, he doesn\u2019t think the historic antipathy between the NUM and the Conservative party, the strikes of 1972-74 that brought down Edward Heath, or the 1984-85 strike, have much to do with what is happening now. Faull agrees, points to the closure of mines in Belgium and elsewhere as evidence of a wider trend, and believes coal\u2019s reputation as dirty and polluting explains its loss of support. Coal continues to provide around a quarter of British electricity, and many are sceptical about plans to replace it. But even if the government does stick to its timetable, millions of tons of coal will be imported for the next 10 years. McLoughlin says price projections make it clear British coal would remain uncompetitive, but the miners take a different view, citing the billions of pounds of government subsidies and guarantees for the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, along with support for renewables, as evidence of bias against them. They are angry, too, about the profits made by energy companies since privatisation. \u201cThey\u2019ve knocked us down and down and down,\u201d says Poulson. \u201cYou could understand we\u2019d have to close if there was no market, but we\u2019re seven miles from Drax, the biggest coal-fired power station in Europe.\u201d \u201cThis country used to be called Great Britain and coal is part of what put \u2018Great\u2019 into that name,\u201d says Kitchen. \u201cWhen you see what has been done for others, it makes you wonder if this is anything to do with climate change, or even economics, or if it is purely a political stance: \u2018Thirty years ago we wanted to kill off the mining industry and this year we\u2019ve finally got the chance.\u2019\u201d In a few weeks\u2019 time, the only deep mine left will be Caphouse, England\u2019s National Coal Mining Museum. I was taken on the underground tour there by former miner John Carrington, who told me how, at busy times, he gets stuck behind men his age pausing in the tunnels to tell their grandchildren their life stories. The museum\u2019s visitor numbers are up this year, though funding is difficult. Carrington was a locomotive foreman before he became a guide, and he has his eye on one of Kellingley\u2019s locomotives as an addition to the collection. Already agreed is the removal to the museum \u2013 from its current spot beside the car park, where it can be seen from the canteen \u2013 of the Kellingley memorial, a bronze frieze of a bare-chested miner for which the men raised \u00a326,000 following the death of one of their number, Don Cook, in 2008. His was one of three deaths at the mine in the past nine years. At the NUM\u2019s headquarters in Barnsley, the brightly painted banners of closed collieries hang from every wall of the council chamber, which is currently being used for rehearsals of a pantomime. \u201cSome people think we\u2019ll become a museum,\u201d says Kitchen, though he is determined to prevent that. In a few weeks, the future of the union \u2013 which will see its membership fall to around 400 open-cast mine and rescue workers after Kellingley\u2019s closure \u2013 will be debated. When I visited her at home in Wakefield, Faull was unemotional about Kellingley\u2019s closure, calling it \u201csad but inevitable\u201d. She was in no doubt about coal\u2019s significance in British history, pointing to the country\u2019s reliance on it over three centuries, but said that, as a historian, she views it dispassionately. She believes the decisions that doomed coal were taken decades ago, when a pre-privatisation National Coal Board programme of fluidised bed burning was cancelled and development of small-scale boilers abandoned. \u201cThe NCB was not focused enough on the future,\u201d she says. \u201cThey took the view there would always be the need for coal. They were used to selling large-scale to power stations, and they saw marketing as negotiating how much they would get per ton.\u201d Last month, the UK government cancelled its \u00a31bn competition for the carbon capture and storage technology that could yet provide a future for coal globally. There are plans to open a new, community-owned drift mine less than 10 miles from the Caphouse museum. But no one seems to doubt that this is the end of deep coal mining in Britain. After mechanical problems last week, work is two days behind schedule at Kellingley, meaning miners may now be asked to work on 19 December, when they might otherwise have been marching to mark the end of their way of life. This article was amended on 7 December 2015 to clarify that the event on 19 December is a farewell march for the miners, their families and supporters, but not a demonstration.",

But Keith Poulson, the union\u2019s branch secretary at Kellingley colliery in north Yorkshire \u2013 whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/02/uks-last-deep-pit-coal-mines-threatened-with-closure\">closure later this month</a> is the reason for the gathering planned for 19 December \u2013 is thinking bigger. He believes that as many as 2,000 people could attend, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the last deep coal mine\u201d. He expects a media scrum along with miners and their families, and says: \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to move for TV crews on the verge out there. If we\u2019d only had as much attention when we were trying to keep the place open, then it might have been a different tale we\u2019re telling now.\u201d</p> <p>There is so much bitterness here that the Kellingley miners rejected an offer by management to lay on a buffet and a brass band to mark their last day at work. Then, at a 40th birthday party a few weeks ago, two women whose partners are among the 451 men still working at Kellingley decided they would arrange something. They fixed on a march modelled on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yvettecoopermp/status/561576289363324928\">one held in January</a>, when the local Labour and Conservative MPs Yvette Cooper and Nigel Adams joined calls for the mine \u2013 which is in Adams\u2019 constituency but so close to Cooper\u2019s that she, too, is heavily involved \u2013 to be saved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/18/will-uk-phase-out-coal-in-decade\">Will the UK phase out coal in a decade?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Led by the Knottingley Silver Band, and with NUM officials carrying the branch banner, the marchers will process the short distance from Knottingley town hall to the Miners\u2019 Social Club. Tickets are on sale for an event later that evening, billed as \u201cThe Last Pit Party\u201d on the poster pinned up in the concourse where the miners clock in and out, and where staff from Jobcentre Plus have set up a temporary surgery to offer advice.</p> <p>Poulson respected union members\u2019 wishes when he agreed that they would just walk away after the final shift. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think it was good to mark the end of the industry \u2013 you only celebrate a victory, don\u2019t you?\u201d he says. But now the two women have taken the initiative, he says he\u2019s glad. \u201cTheir energy is commendable,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Most of the miners I spoke to at Kellingley this week seemed to think they would join the march \u2013 although there were plenty who declined to talk to the handful of journalists allowed in, along with a documentary film crew, to have a look around before the last of more than 50 Yorkshire coal mines is shut. Alan Clasper, a welder, says he hopes the farewells \u201cwill be upbeat, though people will be feeling disappointed. Everyone sticks together, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>Employment prospects are grim for this ageing workforce, some of whom have worked in mines since their teens. A good number had fathers and grandfathers who were miners, and they now face little choice but to apply for unskilled warehouse and driving jobs.

Flights cancelled just hours before take-off, leaving passengers stranded abroad. Promised compensation and other expense claims first ignored, and then fought at every stage - in the hope you\u2019ll give up and go away. If you had to guess which low-cost airline this describes, most readers would likely guess it begins with an R. But it is easyJet that is filling the postbag to consumer champions at both the Guardian and Observer, with readers alleging wrongfully denied compensation and appalling customer service. Two months ago AirHelp, which provides online legal help for those claiming compensation for delays, said its data showed easyJet had the worst record of any airline for paying out what is legally due. Specialist lawyers describe how the company repeatedly puts in place legal obstacles to claims it says are perfectly legitimate. Since two major test cases went against the airlines earlier this year most carriers have been paying up without dispute \u2013 but not easyJet. Two weeks ago it announced a pre-tax profit of \u00a3686m \u2013 up 18% on the previous year, leaving passengers further incensed, and bemused that an airline that carried 68 million customers could have such an approach. Many of the problems appear to stem from the way it chose to react to a serious fire in May at Rome\u2019s Fiumicino airport. This reduced the number of flights allowed in and out but, despite knowing days in advance, easyJet chose \u2013 two months into the disruption \u2013 to cancel flights a matter hours before they were due to leave. It is the biggest airline in the UK, flying more people to and from Europe than even Ryanair, and most journeys go smoothly. But at issue is the way it responds when things go wrong. This is a flavour of what readers have been saying: \u2022 Gary Walton\u2019s five-day golfing break in Spain was wrecked when he and a friend were \u201cbumped off\u201d their flight. They had checked in online a week earlier, and had their boarding passes and seats allocated, but when they tried to check in their luggage at Luton \u2013 over two hours before take-off \u2013 they were told the flight had been overbooked. The pair were offered a direct flight departing three days later, or a flight to Paris that morning with a connecting flight to M\u00e1laga the following evening. Forced to abandon their trip, easyJet paid statutory compensation, but they lost the cost of the hotel, hire car and transfer. \u201cI thought I was buying a flight, not a lottery ticket,\u201d says Walton. \u2022 Mags Hobson missed a funeral after a minor technical problem grounded her flight from Gibraltar back to London in July 2014. She and a friend endured a 27-hour delay that involved a long bus ride to M\u00e1laga, then a second botched attempt to get on a plane in the middle of the night. She accepted that problems occur, but what she hadn\u2019t counted on was her subsequent 14-month battle to get the \u20ac400 compensation which she was due. Her friend gave up trying and has never received a penny. \u2022 Katie Chang was due to fly from Rome to Gatwick in July with a friend on an 11am flight, but at 6pm the night before she was sent a text informing her it had been cancelled. Along with hundreds of other passengers, easyJet told her that she did not qualify for compensation because it was due to \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \u2013 the get-out clause that allows airlines not to pay up. When the Guardian rang the airport to ask about the fire it emerged that airlines chose which flights to cancel with at least five days\u2019 notice. \u2022 Chris Laker of Crawley arrived at Amsterdam airport to find his flight cancelled without warning. He was told that the next possible one was in two days and that he had been booked into a hotel. However, the hotel had no record of the reservation and he was forced to spend the night in the airport. The same thing happened the following evening. After 24 hours in the airport he found and paid for a hotel himself. \u201cIt cost \u00a384 and easyJet refused to reimburse me.\u201d Others readers report being promised by airline staff that easyJet would cover hotel accommodation and other expenses following a delay or re-routing only to find that when they claimed, it was denied, again under the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d rule. Kevin Clarke, from flight delay compensation specialist lawyers Bott &amp; Co, says his firm receives more claims against easyJet for \u201cdenied boarding\u201d than for any other airline. \u201cIt tends to raise the most individual arguments of any airline. It fights the majority of cases and raises complicated legal argument after complicated legal argument \u2013 making it hard for those with little or no knowledge of the law to claim, even when they have a perfectly valid case.\u201d He says in the past it would send successful claimants a cheque in euros rather than sterling, meaning that those with a sterling account would face bank charges. A judge eventually ordered the airline to stop doing it. \u201cWe have the weight of the law behind us, but it\u2019s not so easy for a person who is told by the airline that they are entitled to nothing, or who is ignored completely.\u201d We showed easyJet a sample dossier of 10 complaints from readers. A spokeswoman told Money that it \u201cfully complies with the EU\u2019s compensation rules\u201d and claimed \u201cit was the only airline to obtain a \u2018very good\u2019 rating by a CAA examination into compliance\u201d. It added: \u201cWe aim to provide all of our customers with the highest possible levels of customer service \u2026 easyJet\u2019s customer charter includes the promise to be \u2018open and honest and putting ourselves in our customers\u2019 shoes\u2019. \u201cWe have improved the claims process and customers will get an answer in three working days and payment within a further 21. By spring next year we aim to have reduced this to seven.\u201d She defended the decision to overbook \u201csome\u201d flights and maintained that, following the Rome fire, the authorities had given it less than 48 hours notice to cancel flights \u201con some occasions\u201d, which was why compensation claims had been correctly turned down. \u201cWe understand this can be frustrating \u2026 but we will always pay compensation if it is due.\u201d",
