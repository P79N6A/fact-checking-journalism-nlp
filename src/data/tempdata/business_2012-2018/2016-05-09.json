      "bodyText": "British retailers suffered the sharpest drop in sales for eight months in April as more cautious shoppers reined in spending and cold weather affected sales of spring and summer clothing, industry figures show. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said like-for-like sales fell 0.9% in April on a year earlier, the biggest drop since last August. The weak April performance compounded pressure on retailers after a sales drop of 0.7% in March. Takings in April were flat on a year ago in total terms, which does not adjust for the effect of new store openings, as a drop in fashion sales offset a rare rise in food sales, the BRC said. The trade group predicted trading conditions would remain tough for retailers. It echoed retailers such as Next and Sainsbury\u2019s in highlighting a shift for people to spend more on nights out and holidays than on items from shops \u2013 a trend experts have dubbed the \u201cexperience economy\u201d. \u201cOverall, flat total sales mask a very mixed picture; some retailers benefitting from the healthy housing market, while others are evidently more susceptible to the effects of lower consumer confidence and a higher proportion of disposable income going into leisure and entertainment,\u201d said Helen Dickinson, BRC\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhile glimmers of hope are evident, the rapid pace of change in the industry, increasing cost pressures and other business burdens remain a cause for concern.\u201d The BRC report said the clothing and footwear sector had a \u201cdire month\u201d as a cold spell kept shoppers away from spring-summer ranges, in stark contrast to April a year ago when temperatures were unusually high. \u201cThe same trends as March continued, with outerwear, knitted leggings and essentials like socks and underwear continuing to do well while dresses, shorts and T-shirts showed significant declines,\u201d the BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor said. \u201cFootwear was the worst performing category in April ... The sales deficit came mostly from sandals and canvasses, while boots remained in demand.\u201d The performance for clothing and for footwear sales when measured over the latest three months together was the worst since BRC records began in 2010. In contrast, furniture and home accessories sales fared well and rose last month. Food sales grew for the first time since the start of the year, bringing some welcome relief for grocers\u2019 margins hurt by falling prices amid fierce competition. But the respite could prove short-lived, warned David McCorquodale, head of retail at the consultancy KPMG, the report\u2019s co-authors. \u201cAs consumers still appear to be hooked on a diet of discounts, deflationary trends in the sector look set to continue,\u201d he said. The gloomy news on sales follows other reports suggesting consumers have become more cautious thanks to a slowing economy, weakening pay growth and worries about the a knife-edge EU referendum in June. Separate figures from Barclaycard on Tuesday suggest consumer spending rose just 1.9% in April, well below a rolling 12-month average of 3.7%. Shoppers cut back their spending on essentials \u2013 hurting supermarkets most, with the category shrinking 6.1%, the worst performance since Barclaycard records began in 2011. Spending on clothing fell 3.5%, in the worst performance for three years, according to Barclaycard, which processes nearly half of all credit and debit card transactions in the UK. There was further evidence that people were prioritising leisure spending, with air travel up by 6.5% and restaurants up 11.3%. \u201cApril proved another challenging month for retail as consumers held back in the face of economic headwinds. The feel-good factor they enjoyed in 2015, encouraged by rising employment and increasing household incomes, has been hit by a combination of uncertainty on everything from oil prices to the EU referendum,\u201d said Barclaycard managing director, Paul Lockstone.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The first election campaign episode of QandA was stolen by an audience member with a simple question that split the panel like splinters. \u201cI\u2019ve got a disability and a low education, that means I\u2019ve spent my whole life working for minimum wage,\u201d said Duncan Storrar. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna lift the tax-free threshold for rich people. If you lift my tax-free threshold, that changes my life. That means that I get to say to my little girls, \u2018Daddy\u2019s not broke this weekend. We can go to the pictures.\u2019 Rich people don\u2019t even notice their tax-free threshold lift. Why don\u2019t I get it? Why do they get it?\u201d Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, the minister for small business and assistant treasurer, seemed to be reading from the rather discredited theory of trickle-down economics in reply. \u201cThe critical thing here is that we actually need to grow the pie,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to give people an incentive to work, to invest in their businesses and to employ people and create better lives for themselves.\u201d On Twitter Greens senator Janet Rice suggested the opposite to trickle-down economics might be the answer. The question of trickle-down economics was raised directly by another audience member. \u201cThe Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz totally rejected the trickle-down theory of economics where if you take care of the rich the benefits will flow down to all,\u201d Loretta Little said. \u201cWhy has the Coalition designed the budget around the fallacy of Reaganomics and the Laffer curve?\u201d Responding to the question Innes Willox, the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, brought it back to Storrar, and tried to take a hard line. \u201cDuncan, I\u2019ll be harsh in my message. If you\u2019re on the minimum wage and with a family, you would not pay much tax, if any at all. Would you? You would not pay much tax.\u201d Duncan replied to a loud applause: \u201cI pay tax every time I go to the supermarket. Every time I hop in my car.\u201d But Willox recovered and put forward the case of corporate tax cuts. \u201cWhat, according to the head of Treasury it will do, is drive $160bn into the economy over 10 years. That\u2019s a pretty good return on a $50bn investment. That will create the jobs of the future.\u201d But the sorts of jobs getting created was another issue raised on the program. One audience member said she was disappointed to not hear in the recent budget, anything about a transition from fossil fuels. \u201cA transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy seems to align perfectly with the government\u2019s mantra of jobs and growth but can anyone please explain why there is no plan for this transition in the budget?,\u201d asked Sarah McColl-Gausden. O\u2019Dwyer responded by arguing that Australia\u2019s cuts to greenhouse gas emissions are \u201cvery ambitious\u201d. Australia agreed in Paris to cut emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels. \u201cPer capita, we are up there with Brazil in actually having the highest emissions reductions in the world,\u201d she said. But relying on per-capita emissions reductions makes Australia\u2019s cuts look quite strong, since we have some of the largest per-capita emissions in the world to start with. Our absolute emissions cuts are set at 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. Climate Change Authority chairman Bernie Fraser said that puts Australia \u201cat or near the bottom of the group of countries we generally compare ourselves with\u201d. And others have said it isn\u2019t consistent with keeping warming under 2C. Andrew Leigh, Labor\u2019s shadow assistant treasurer, said: \u201cLabor believes we need more ambitious climate targets in line with what the Climate Change Authority recommends and we should get to zero net emissions by 2050.\u201d O\u2019Dwyer responded: \u201cI think it\u2019s quite irresponsible of Andrew to say that he wants an even higher target because of course the only way that he\u2019ll be able to deliver that is to impose new taxes such as a new carbon tax.\u201d But in the end it was Duncan Storrar\u2019s question that really left people thinking.",

      "bodyText": "Long experience of the eurozone debt crisis means we shouldn\u2019t get too excited tonight. Today\u2019s extraordinary meeting does seem to have made real progress, but the next two weeks could still see some turbulence. And Greece\u2019s long-term economic prospects remain deeply troubled, even if it does get finally some debt relief. But this could still be remembered as a moment when the crisis eased a little, meaning the eurozone could experience a summer free of debt dramas. Three things have been agreed: 1) Greece is on the brink of receiving a much-needed slug of bailout cash, after eurozone finance ministers welcomed its latest package of austerity measures, tax rises and pension reforms 2) However, the eurogroup are demanding more work on contingency measures in case Greece cannot hit its bailout targets. A compromise is being hammered out, which means Greece won\u2019t have to vote specific measure into law right now. 3) In a historic step, ministers actually talked about how to cut Greece\u2019s debt burden. However, in the short-term, it is only considering relatively modest changes. In the medium term, though, Greece could be granted longer grace and payment periods. And in the long-term, further debt writedowns could be considered. The FT\u2019s Mehreen Kahn has dubbed it a \u201cbaby steps\u201d approach. But encouragingly, both sides appear happy tonight. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici described the situation as \u201cwork in good progress\u201d, suggesting that officials would make good progress before the next meeting on 24 May. And Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, also seemed cheerful, declaring that: \u201cIt was a very good Eurogroup for Greece and I think a very good Eurogroup for Europe.\u201d This point has also just echoed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who is claiming success in his handling of the crisis. Tsakalotos did admit, though, that there wasn\u2019t a \u201cmeeting of minds\u201d on the debt relief issue.... But there\u2019s one major question mark tonight - we still don\u2019t know if the International Monetary Fund is going to accept this plan, and come on board. Leaving the eurogroup meeting, Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb said this is crucial. He simply doesn\u2019t have a mandate for a Finnish involvement in the Greek bailout unless the IMF are there too, for example. And there would be merry hell in the Bundestag too if the IMF walked away. So, plenty of opportunity for twists and turns in the next two weeks, until the eurogroup meets again on the 24 May. For now, though, most commentators agree this has been that rare thing, a good day for Greece. So let\u2019s enjoy that. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting! GW Over in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras is welcoming the progress made in Brussels today. Given the scale of last weekend\u2019s anti-austerity protests, Tsipras is understandably keen to argue that he\u2019s making progress. The commitment to debt relief was the only real success from last year\u2019s bailout talks, after all. Paul Mason, the former Channel 4 News economics editor, has written about the Greek crisis for the Guardian tonight. He argues that the call for Greek debt relief is part of a larger transformation in Europe: So, now it\u2019s no longer about austerity: there is a three-way battle for the soul of Europe; between a beleaguered centre that\u2019s seeing its consent to govern drain away; a resurgent nationalist and racist right; and a modernised radical left. The Greek request for debt relief poses to the European centre the question: which side are you on? Amid this, the resurgent radical left faces tough decisions of its own. To understand why, we have to understand the source of its recent strength. Podemos came out of the millions-strong indignados movement in 2011; Syriza expanded during the \u201coccupation of the squares\u201d the same year. The 188,000 people who joined the Labour party during and after Corbyn\u2019s campaign are not just trade unionists and old lefties; at their core are student activists who learned their politics during occupation movement of 2010/11, and hordes of returning Greens. Sinn Fein\u2019s transformation and growth in Ireland is likewise driven by a grassroots protest movement against water charges.... Here\u2019s the full piece: The Greek finance ministry has issued an upbeat statement, saying that further austerity measures will not be required following today\u2019s meeting: Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras should be hot-footing it to the presidential palace within 30 minutes: Euclid Tsakalotos concludes his press conference by saying he expects the IMF to come on board and support this deal. And all sides are confident that Greece can achieve its targets, meaning contingency measures may never be needed. This is one reason the Greek side are happy tonight: The Greek government did succeed in passing pension reforms, and income tax changes, last night - but it could have faced a revolt if it asked for more detailed austerity. The IMF was pleased that debt relief was discussed today, says Tsakalotos, although obviously it wants more debt relief for Greece than some countries. Euclid Tsakalotos is now outlining the new plan for contingency measures (extra austerity, if needed) If Greece misses its targets, then a presidential decree would enforce \u2018across the line\u2019 cuts, he says. The government could subsequently implement some different measures in a budget. We think this is legally binding, and will address creditors concerns. Euclid Tsakalotos says there was a \u201cvery interesting exchange of views\u201d on the issue of Greek debt relief today. Ministers didn\u2019t agree on everything, but there was a commitment to tackle the issue. He also supports the \u2018three-layer\u2019 approach, to tackle Greek debt relief on a short, medium and long-term basis (see earlier). It\u2019s a \u201cgreat relief\u201d to finally have this meeting on debt relief and talk about the specifics, to help Greece finally turn the corner. Our expectation is that by 24 May we\u2019ll have an agreement on fine-tuning the contingency measures, and we may also have agreement on debt relief too. Greece, and our creditors, both need to feel that we are turning the page and that the vicious circle of measures leading to recession, leading to new measures, is over, Tsakalotos says. Once we have the green light from creditors, it will give much-needed confidence to businesses, investors and consumers. Tsakalotos says that Greece is relieved that its contingency measures is being used as the basis for discussions. Hang on.... Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece\u2019s finance minister, is giving a press conference now. He being by telling reporters that This was a very good eurogroup for Greece, and I think a very good eurogroup for Europe. He thanks Jeroen Dijsselblom for acting as an \u2018honest broker\u2019 in the build-up to this meeting. We have agreed a package of measure of fiscal measures, and structural reforms. And once they are legislated, funds will be dispensed to Greece. Q: What happens if Greece does not legislate for extra contingency measures? And has the eurogroup made a big mistake by adding it at all? No, it was a clever idea to bridge the difference between the eurogroup and IMF forecasts, Dijsselbloem replies to the second question. We need an insurance in case the pessimists (at the IMF) are right. And on the first point, Dijsselbloem says the eurogroup has recognised Greece\u2019s concerns about voting through extra austerity that might or might not be needed We will not make the Greeks legislate specific measures up front, he says. We will make them legislate the mechanism, so it\u2019s clear what happens if the programme goes off course. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. I\u2019ll do a summary now.... Q: Do we need an agreement on the whole package, including debt relief, before the next tranche of aid is paid out? No, it\u2019s not necessary formally, or politically necessary either, says eurogroup chair Jeroen Dijsselbloem. As long as we\u2019re comfortable that the IMF are going to \u2018come on board\u2019 and support the package, we could simply move to the disbursement, he adds. Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb has tweeted that he\u2019s \u2018carefully optimistic\u2019 that there will be a deal by the next meeting on 24 May. The IMF is \u201cless optimistic, or more conservative if you will\u201d about how Greece\u2019s economy will perform by 2018, Jeroen Dijsselbloem says. Thus, the extra contingency measures are needed, in case the Fund are right. The IMF agreed and supported our approach at today\u2019s meeting, Dijsselbloem adds. Q: Are you ready to go ahead with the programme without the IMF (as Slovakia\u2019s finance minister suggested earlier) No, it\u2019s not a possibility for the eurogroup as a whole, Dijsselbloem insists. Several members cherish the involvement of the IMF, he adds [such as Germany, of course]. Q: What have you changed to Greece\u2019s proposal for contingency measures in case it misses its fiscal targets? We have accepted Greece\u2019s proposal, but with a couple of new conditions to enforce it, Dijsselbloem says. They are 1) They will initially consist of \u201cExpenditure measures across the board, discretionary and non-discretionary\u201d. Ie, Greece would have to slash spending. 2) Greece could then adjust the measures in a subsequent budget, to add revenue elements (to replace some expenditure cuts). That could make it more balanced. 3) The package must be agreed with creditors first. \u201cIt would be unfortunate if Greece implemented contingency measures and then the eurogroup said it wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d Today\u2019s meeting was about opening the debate on Greek debt sustainability and considering the options, Jeroen Dijsselbloem continues, and also deciding what officials should start to work on. Some instant reaction: Onto questions..... Q: You are only proposing long-term debt relief for Greece after 2018, if Greece hits its commitments. Will that really satisfy the IMF? It depends what is agreed by May 24, says Dijsselbloem. It is fair to assume that there will be debt sustainability with Greece, he continues, so it\u2019s likely that it will need extra help at the end of the current bailout package in 2018. Now Klaus Regling, who runs the eurozone bailout fund (the EFSF), is speaking, and confirms that Greek debt relief talks began today. The liquidity situation in Greece is getting tighter, he warns, and important debt repayments are coming up (Athens owes \u20ac3.5bn in July). Regling also points out that Greece did get a big debt writedown in 2012, when private creditors took a haircut that saved Athens billions in debt repayments each year. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is now speaking. He says that ensuring the sustainability of Greece\u2019s debt is a \u201cfundamental element\u201d of the agreement reached last summer. Dijsselbloem\u2019s decision to consider Greeces\u2019s debt relief on a short-term, medium-term and long-term basis is \u201cvery wise\u201d. Today is work in progress, but work in good progress, he concludes. The Eurogroup\u2019s aim is to make Greece\u2019s debts sustainable in the long term, Jeroen Dijsselbloem adds. Dijsselbloem turns to debt relief. Today\u2019s eurogroup meeting held a \u201cfirst round\u201d of talks about Greek debt relief, he says. They are now looking at Greece\u2019s annual gross financing needs, rather than the debt/GDP measure. And they considered Greece\u2019s short-term, medium-term and long-term debt sustainability, he says. In the short term, they are looking at ways of optimising Greece\u2019s debt to lower repayment costs. In the medium term, the eurozone working group has been asked to look at measures which could take place in 2018, at the end of the current programme. They could lower Greece\u2019s debt costs, by lowering interest rate costs or changing repayment dates. For the long term, the eurogroup stands ready, if necessary and if Greece is compliant with its targets, to consider whether further debt relief is needed. On the contingency measures, Dijsselbloem says the eurogroup took the last proposal from the Greek government and \u2018enforced it\u2019 \u2013 or amended it \u2013 to make sure revenues can be recovered if Athens fails to achieve its fiscal targets. Those measures will be \u201clegislated upfront\u201d and kick in automatically, Dijsselbloem says. That may means the Greek parliament has to vote these measure through, which could be a challenge... 8pm update: a presidential decree will be used, so there shouldn\u2019t be a revolt in parliament The press conference is starting now.... Jeroen Dijsselbloem says the eurogroup discussed three things the policy package which has been drawn up, following last summer\u2019s bailout deal the contingency mechanisms in case Greece veers off course A first-round discussion on debt sustainability. He says the eurogroup welcomed the Greek policy package, which should pave the way for the (long-awaited) successful completion of its first bailout review. The next two weeks could be quite tense as Greece and her creditors try to carve up a staff level agreement. Slovakia\u2019s Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr says today\u2019s meeting was much better than he had expected: That\u2019s not *quite* the same as saying it actually went well..... The eurogroup press conference will be broadcast here. EC vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis is tweeting that the meeting has ended. He says eurogroup ministers welcomed the package of measures which Greece has agreed. But he also says discussions will continue on May 24th, at the next scheduled eurogroup meeting. The eurogroup meeting on Greece has ended, we hear, so the press conference should begin shortly. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, warns that Greece could be driven into default unless its creditors compromise. He writes: This was a situation only narrowly averted last summer and on his way into Monday\u2019s meeting, Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants a repeat of summer 2015.\u201d Schelling spoke for many, including David Cameron, who could certainly do with Greece being out of the headlines for the next six weeks. Britain\u2019s referendum means that the eurozone has to act with unaccustomed speed and sort Greece out within a fortnight. Otherwise the issue will be parked until after June 23 and another long, hot summer will loom large. More here: The Greek government will face serious criticism back home unless it gets a substantial deal on debt relief soon. Blanka Kolenikova, senior analyst at IHS Country Risk, says it could even collapse: The government\u2019s public support will depend on progress on debt relief, which IHS maintains will take the form of extended maturities and fixing/lowering the interest rates applied to official loans. The SYRIZA-led government had campaigned strongly on an anti-austerity platform before assuming power in 2015. Achieving some degree of debt relief therefore represents a crucial life line for the administration, especially given the cost-cutting measures it has been forced to pass. Failed debt negotiations could trigger further and more violent protests (violence has so far been caused primarily by anarchist groups). Significantly increased civil disorder would put pressure on the leftist government to resign. An early election would not favour SYRIZA and would risk a political stalemate, without any party able to form a stable majority government. In turn, this would reduce Greece\u2019s ability to pass bailout-related measures and threaten its ability to secure future releases of official funding. The Wall Street Journal has seen the Greek debt sustainability analysis drawn up by Greece\u2019s creditors, which is on the table in Brussels today. It shows remarkable uncertainty over Greece\u2019s ability to reduce its debt pile. One estimate shows Athens\u2019 borrowing spiralling out of control over the next 45 years; another shows it being steadily eroded. The WSJ says: Greece\u2019s debt may rise to as much as 258.3% of gross domestic product by 2060 or fall to as low as 62.6% of GDP, according to an official analysis of the country\u2019s debt trajectory, a wide divergence that indicates difficult discussions ahead on the possibility of debt relief. More here: Official Analysis Suggests Tough Talks Over Greek Debt Relief Hopes of a breakthrough deal between Greece and creditors on debt relief have been dashed today, although in truth is never looked like (as we warned in the opening post). Instead, May 24 has been inked in as the next in a long line of Greek deadlines. That gives the eurozone two weeks to achieve three things: agree whether Greece has met the terms of its bailout, to unlock around \u20ac5bn in aid settle on \u2018contingency measures\u2019 that would kick in if Greece fails to hit bailout targets find a mutually agreeable way to make Greece\u2019s debt pile, worth 180% of GDP, more sustainable. Eurozone ministers are now hunkered down in Brussels, considering whether the austerity measures agreed by Greece\u2019s MPs last night are enough. Some key players sounded relatively optimistic, such as commissioner Pierre Moscovici: Others, such as Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb and Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, may still need convincing that Greece has done enough. And eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem says that while debt relief is on the agenda, there won\u2019t be any firm conclusions today. A press conference is scheduled for this evening, at perhaps 6pm or 7pm Brussels time (5pm or 6pm BST). Europe\u2019s finance chiefs are now gathered inside the EU council building to discuss Greece\u2019s bailout programme. These photos have just arrived, showing ministers in good spirits: Here\u2019s the Slovakian position: This may not be very practical. The financial markets might be alarmed if the IMF dropped out of the Greek bailout, and the German parliament would probably be furious. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan says his country still opposes cutting Greece\u2019s debt pile. Instead, Ireland favours giving Greece debt relief by extending the repayment dates and cutting interest rates. Noonan adds that he expects progress, but no deal today. Instead, he points to next meeting on May 24th. Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb is also playing down expectations for today\u2019s meeting: Germany\u2019s finance minister is also defending Greece\u2019s three bailout programmes: Schauble forgot to mention that much of the money went to those who held Greek debt, helping German banks to stay on their feet.... Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, speaks for us all: Austria certainly doesn\u2019t want another Greek crisis; it\u2019s already reeling from the shock resignation of chancellor Werner Faymann this morning (see earlier post) May 24th has just been inked in as the next deadline in the Greek debt saga. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has just told reporters that he hopes to make progress today, but no financial decision. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem says that he hope to reach an agreement with Greece by May 24, when ministers hold their next scheduled meting. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has just warned that a final decision on Greek\u2019s bailout, and debt relief, is not likely today. He just arrived at the eurogroup meeting in Brussels, and spoke to reporters. Q: What are the prospects for Greek debt relief to be on the table today? We\u2019re definitely going to discuss it. We\u2019ll discuss when, if, under what conditions this could take place. Is it necessary? But this is the first discussion. i don\u2019t expect any definite conclusions on it yet. Dijsselbloem also warned that ministers need more time to consider Greece\u2019s reforms, and its proposals for contingency measures: Italy\u2019s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, says ministers will not consider cutting the face value of Greece\u2019s debts: (as explained earlier, they could ease Athens burden in other ways) Pierre Moscovici also denies that the eurogroup is backtracking on its commitment to debt relief. With progress made on reforms and the contingency measures, attention can now turn to debt, he says. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has just arrived at the eurogroup meeting (for the second time - he must have sneaked out and in again). He is telling reporters that the EC believes Greece has achieved a lot. The pension reforms and income tax reforms voted yesterday are \u201cvery important steps\u201d, says Moscovici. \u201cWe should today recognise that this effort has have been taken.... It represents a very strong amount of measures - and with that, Greece will be on this way to recover growth.\u201d Moscovici adds that \u201cwe\u2019re on the right path\u201d in talks about the extra contingency measures which lenders are demanding. He also admits that the issue of debt relied is \u201ca question mostly for the member states.\u201d B he\u2019s still hopeful, declaring: I hopes today that we will set the framework for a global deal, a demanding deal. That\u2019s what the commission believes, and we believe it\u2019s possible. Spain\u2019s man in Brussels today, Luis de Guindos, says he\u2019s optimistic of a deal between Greece and creditors soon: You can watch the arrivals in Brussels on the EbS service, here: LIVE Eurogroup meeting Arrivals Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, tweets that he expects a \u2018debate\u2019 on Greece\u2019s progress. He was one of Athens\u2019 toughest critics during last year\u2019s bailout dramas. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert has tried to pour cold water on hopes of a Greek debt relief deal today. Nothing can be discussed until Greece has proved that its economic reforms are satisfactory, Seibert told a press conference this morning. More here Back in Brussels, officials are getting ready for ready for talks on how to make Greece\u2019s debts more sustainable. Options on the table could include lowering the interest rate on Greek bonds, or \u201creprofiling\u201d them to give Athens more time to repay. Here\u2019s Reuters latest: Euro zone finance ministers will start talks on Monday on how to reprofile Greek debt to make future annual servicing costs manageable for Athens despite opposition from Germany, which does not believe any relief isneeded, euro zone officials said. The International Monetary Fund believes that Athens must get debt relief for its economy to develop and wants the discussions to focus on capping Greece\u2019s annual debt servicing costs at around 15% of GDP or less. Germany believes Greece can do without debt relief for now,especially that it does not have to service its debt until after 2022, when a 10-year grace period expires. This sudden political crisis in Austria threatens to overshadow today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. Perhaps it might also encourage eurozone finance ministers to make some progress on Greece, to show populist voices that Europe can work..... More breaking news: Austria\u2019s leader, chancellor Werner Faymann, has just resigned. Faymann had been under pressures from his party, the centre-left social democrats, to work with the far-right Freedom Party. The Freedom Party, which is anti-Islam and eurosceptic, is in a strong position to win the Austrian presidency in a ballot later this month. This appears to have triggered another bout of political instability in Europe.... Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund is urging Germany speed up its public infrastructure spending, and get more refugees into work. In its latest assessment of the German economy, the IMF says: More progress on structural reforms would revitalize potential growth and enhance the authorities\u2019 leadership at the European level in this area. A more dynamic Germany would also benefit the still fragile economic recovery in the euro area. The IMF also warns that economic growth will remain moderate. Strong domestic demand will offset weak external demand, meaning Germany will continue to run a near-record current account surplus. Here\u2019s the IMF\u2019s \u2018key policy messages\u2019 to Berlin: Accelerate structural reforms to boost growth potential by broadening the labor market participation of refugees, women, and older workers, and spurring competition in the services sector. Step up public and private investment to meet infrastructure needs, while tackling administrative bottlenecks. Remove impediments to housing supply expansion to better relieve the pressure on the housing market. Develop the legal basis for real-estate-related macroprudential tools to better contain potential future excesses. Improve financial sector oversight and macroprudential policy analysis by enhancing data collection. Implement measures to strengthen the oversight role of banks\u2019 supervisory boards by increasing their responsibilities and tightening member qualifications standards. Together with the European competent authorities, complete the new bank resolution and crisis management agenda, as Germany is home to globally systemic institutions. Today\u2019s meeting could be fiery, predicts John Springford of the Centre for European Reform. The problem is that the IMF is insisting on debt relief and lower fiscal targets for Greece, otherwise it walks away. Germany isn\u2019t convinced that either are needed, but is also adamant that the IMF must be involved in the Greek programmes. We can usually rely on Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for monetary union, for some upbeat quotes. Not today, though. Moscovici has arrived at the eurogroup meeting without speaking to the press. France\u2019s finance minister, Michel Sapin, has arrived early for today\u2019s meeting. He sounds pretty upbeat: What would \u201cthe best\u201d be? Well, agreement on the contingency measures, releasing the next bailout tranche, and starting to talk about debt relief would cover it..... Update: Sapin even gave reporters a cheery wave: German vice chancellor Sigmar Gabriel has urged eurozone finance ministers to start talks about Greek debt relief today. Gabriel, who is the deputy leader of the Social Democrat Party (junior coalition partners), warned that Greece\u2019s economy cannot take further austerity. In a speech in Berlin this morning, he declared: \u201cWe must help the country to reduce its debt burden..... That\u2019s why a step must finally be made at today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting in Brussels to move towards a situation where Greece doesn\u2019t have to fight every year again to get new loans in order to repay old loans.\u201d It\u2019s an timely intervention from Gabriel, which also highlights the split with the German government over Greece. Finance minister Wolfgang Schauble has argued that Greece\u2019s huge borrowing pile is currently sustainable, meaning debt relief is not required. And those tensions could make it harder to get a deal today, warns Alex White of the Economist Intelligence Unit: Officials at the Greek finance ministry are insisting this morning that an agreement in principle has been reached on the core \u20ac5.4bn package of measures demanded by lenders. One said: \u201cThere is an agreement in principle [concerning] the contents of the review: the privatisations fund, Non Performing Loans, social security and tax [systems], indirect taxes\u201d. Greece\u2019s counter proposal to institute an automatic mechanism that would trigger across the board cuts in the event of finances veering of course \u2013 rather than extra contingency measures that would never get parliamentary approval - will be discussed in Brussels at a euro working group this morning, the ministry said. Analysts in Athens say the automatic brake is crucial if the once vehemently anti-austerity leftist-led government is to be able to return triumphantly from today\u2019s crunch meeting. \u201cThe irony is that this government has already put it name to very tough measures,\u201d the veteran politics watcher Christos Memis told me. \u201cThe protracted negotiations have been all about proving they are not traitors of the left. It is crucial that they now win this battle over extra [contingency] measures \u2026. If not, they will probably do something out of the box like early elections.\u201d Finland\u2019s finance minister, Alex Stubb, is on his way to today\u2019s eurogroup meeting. Greek bonds are rallying this morning, as traders welcome the news that MPs approved fresh austerity measures overnight. Money is flowing back into Greece\u2019s debt, pushing down the interest rate (or yield) that investors demand to hold the bonds. The yield on two-year Greek debt has fallen sharply to 9.4%, down from 10.2% on Friday. That still shows a significant risk of default, though -- many shorter-dated eurozone bonds actually trade with a negative yield today. Greece\u2019s 10-year bonds, the benchmark of financial health, are also rallying. Their yield has fallen to 8.4%, down from 8.6%, which looks like a four-month low. Patrick Jacq, European rate strategist at BNP Paribas, says the drop in Greek yields is a good sign: \u201cThe vote in parliament is constructive and positive for the Eurogroup talks and that should help the decision to give Greece additional support,\u201d said (thanks to Reuters for the quote) This pie chart, from Bloomberg, shows how the IMF and European institutions now hold most of Greece\u2019s debt: Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit also predicts trouble ahead: Greece could soon be plunged into the uncertainty of another general election, fears analyst Wolfgang Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence. He\u2019s worried that the two sides still haven\u2019t reached a decision on \u2018contingency measures\u2019 (fresh austerity) that would be implemented if Greece failed to hit the targets set by creditors. While Athens insists on an automatic fiscal brake that would trigger across-the-board cuts, the institutions, and especially the IMF, consider this option neither credible nor sustainable. In contrast, they are calling for specific measures that should be legislated upfront and have an automatic trigger. While Tsipras\u2019 preference is to conclude the review as soon as possible, the nature of the contingency package could determine the fate of his government as it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to secure the required 151 votes. Conversely, Germany will be unwilling to discuss debt relief any further without a specific Greek contingency package with automatic triggers. Teneo reckons there\u2019s a 65% chance that a deal will be reached. But.... The risk of snap polls could increase significantly if the lenders decide to play hardball by insisting on a contingency package that Tsipras cannot either accept or get approved in parliament. The Eurogroup meeting scheduled for 24 May could offer the next opportunity for a deal. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has leapt on the protests in Athens last night, as proof that Britain should quit the EU: It\u2019s worth noting that while thousands of people protested in Athens, the violence appeared to be restricted to a group of youths throwing flares and Molotov cocktails at officers who responded with volleys of tear gas. Here\u2019s our latest dispatch from Athens: The Greek crisis is returning to centre stage on today, says Bloomberg. Aid deliberations by its international creditors will signal whether the country faces a renewed period of political drift or wins some economic breathing space after six years of turbulence. Bloomberg: Greece Fights to Unlock Aid as Impasse Risks Political Unrest The Wall Street Journal says that the pension and tax measures agreed last night match the bulk of the austerity demanded by lenders. However.... Greece\u2019s most influential creditors, Germany and the International Monetary Fund, remain deadlocked over the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout plan, which the IMF thinks is badly flawed but Germany says can\u2019t be changed. The Eurogroup, as the committee of eurozone finance ministers is known, will meet in Brussels on Monday to discuss Greece\u2019s fiscal strategy and the sustainability of its debts. A resolution of the deep differences isn\u2019t expected. WSJ: Greece Passes Austerity Measures as Creditors Remain Deadlocked Over Bailout Terms The Financial Times warns that IMF and Germany are still demanding extra austerity in case Greece\u2019s bailout goes off course -- but are opposed by the Greek side, and the European Commission. Eurozone officials said that the stalemate over the contingency measures made it unlikely that any agreement to close the first review will be reached at Monday\u2019s meeting. Greece needs the additional bailout aid by July, when \u20ac3.5bn in debt comes due. The Greek government has sought to blame the IMF for the delays, and a senior Greek official said on Sunday that both the commission and the European Central Bank believed that Athens had done enough to close the review. \u201cThere are some measures that still have to be adopted but the Europeans now appear to be satisfied,\u201d the official said. FT: Greece approves pension and income tax reforms There were familiar scenes in Athens last night as MPs gathered to vote on a \u20ac5.4bn package of budget cuts and pension reforms. Thousands of demonstrators flocked to the Greek capital to protest against the austerity piled on the country, at the end of a three-day general strike. It turned violent at one stage, with riot police using tear gas after a group of masked demonstrators threw rocks and petrol bombs. There was drama inside the parliament too, with opposition leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis laying into prime minister Tsipras over his handling of the crisis. Crisis watcher Iliana Magra live-tweeted the whole thing here: Tsipras, though, insisted that Greece was making progress, saying: We have an important opportunity before us for the country to break this vicious cycle, and enter a virtuous cycle. And the PM also argued that Monday will be a \u201cvery important day\u201d, because: After six years (of crisis), the Eurogroup will meet to discuss debt relief. Despite predictions of defections, Tsipras\u2019s coalition stuck together and approved the package, including a lower income-tax threshold. Good morning. The long-running, seemingly never-ending Greek debt crisis is back on the agenda. Finance ministers from across the eurogroup will gather in Brussels this afternoon, hoping to make two important moves. They could finally complete the long-stalled first review of Greece\u2019s massive EU-IMF bailout (the one agreed last July) They could start talking about debt relief measures for Greece. The talks could be productive (at least by EU standards), as the Greek parliament has just agreed a new package of tough austerity measures overnight. That vote should pave the way to unlock the next tranche of bailout aid for Greece. That would be welcome, following months of deadlock between Athens and creditors over \u20ac3.5bn of extra \u201ccontingency measures\u201d demanded in case Greece fails to hit its budget targets. There won\u2019t be a major decision on debt relief today, of course. Officially, the eurogroup\u2019s plan is to \u201cdiscuss possible debt relief measures aiming at ensuring that Greece\u2019s gross financing needs remain at a sustainable level, with a view to reach a political agreement.\u201d But it is still an important meeting. Last Friday, the International Monetary Fund urged the eurozone to begin debt relief negotiations right away, and to recognise that the fiscal targets set for Greece last summer are simply unachievable. Otherwise, the IMF could possibly walk away from the whole adventure.... Eurozone ministers should gather in Brussels around 3pm local time (2pm BST), followed by an early-evening press conference. We\u2019ll track all the main events through the day....",

The 188,000 people who joined the Labour party during and after Corbyn\u2019s campaign are not just trade unionists and old lefties; at their core are student activists who learned their politics during occupation movement of 2010/11, and hordes of returning Greens.

The SYRIZA-led government had campaigned strongly on an anti-austerity platform before assuming power in 2015. Achieving some degree of debt relief therefore represents a crucial life line for the administration, especially given the cost-cutting measures it has been forced to pass.</p> <p>Failed debt negotiations could trigger further and more violent protests (violence has so far been caused primarily by anarchist groups). Significantly increased civil disorder would put pressure on the leftist government to resign. An early election would not favour SYRIZA and would risk a political stalemate, without any party able to form a stable majority government. In turn, this would reduce Greece\u2019s ability to pass bailout-related measures and threaten its ability to secure future releases of official funding.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c0ea6b4b67d48f382d0442a6b2b8b37a000b24b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c0ea6b4b67d48f382d0442a6b2b8b37a000b24b/0_0_4072_2714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Last night, riot policemen on the streets during anti-austerity protests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last night, riot policemen on the streets during anti-austerity protests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pacific Pres/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5730a885e4b002f4e7ed86b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-09T15:23:57.673Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Wall Street Journal has seen the Greek debt sustainability analysis drawn up by Greece\u2019s creditors, which is on the table in Brussels today.</strong></p> <p>It shows remarkable uncertainty over Greece\u2019s ability to reduce its debt pile.</p> <p>One estimate shows Athens\u2019 borrowing spiralling out of control over the next 45 years; another shows it being steadily eroded.</p> <p>The WSJ says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Greece\u2019s debt may rise to as much as 258.3% of gross domestic product by 2060 or fall to as low as 62.6% of GDP, according to an official analysis of the country\u2019s debt trajectory, a wide divergence that indicates difficult discussions ahead on the possibility of debt relief.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/eurogroup-president-jeroen-djisselbloem-says-no-immediate-decisions-on-greek-debt-relief-1462802947\">Official Analysis Suggests Tough Talks Over Greek Debt Relief</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dannyctkemp/status/729693438418034689\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Blimey <a href=\"https://t.co/91MyAVVKGR\">https://t.co/91MyAVVKGR</a></p>&mdash; Danny Kemp (@dannyctkemp) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannyctkemp/status/729693438418034689\">May 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-09T15:24:49.897Z\">at 4.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5730a717e4b0af04cb8897e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-09T15:05:15.154Z\">4.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2147b02c191bf0df5299a33f12c086de93569fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2147b02c191bf0df5299a33f12c086de93569fc/0_0_4256_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeroen Dijsselbloem ringing the bell to open today\u2019s EU eurogroup meeting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeroen Dijsselbloem ringing the bell to open today\u2019s EU eurogroup meeting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57309a8ee4b0af04cb889781\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-09T14:52:56.471Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurogroup meeting: a quick recap</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hopes of a breakthrough deal between Greece and creditors on debt relief have been dashed today, although in truth is never looked like (as we warned in the opening post).</strong><br></p> <p>Instead, May 24 has been inked in as the next in a long line of Greek deadlines.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Pensions Regulator has admitted that it only found about the controversial sale of BHS by Sir Philip Green after reading about it in the newspapers. The revelation raises further questions about the nature of the sale to Dominic Chappell, who has been bankrupt three times, and the powers of the regulator. Lesley Titcomb, the regulator\u2019s chief executive, told MPs that the body had concerns about BHS since 2012, but an \u201canti-avoidance\u201d investigation into the funding of its pension scheme was only launched after the sale to Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions in March 2015. BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at up to \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership and Retail Acquisitions receiving payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS over the last 13 months. The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. Titcomb said that if the Pensions Regulator had been told of the sale it would have taken steps to ensure provisions had been taken for the pension scheme. She said the \u201canti-avoidance\u201d investigation \u2013 which could force Green to contribute towards the deficit \u2013 should make significant progress by the end of the year. However, the regulator was criticised by MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee and work and pensions committee, who are holding a joint investigation into the demise of BHS. Richard Fuller, the Conservative MP for Bedford and Kempston, said: \u201cFor good reasons or bad, you don\u2019t sound like much of a regulator.\u201d Titcomb said the body became concerned about BHS in 2012 after a 23-year recovery plan for the pension scheme was agreed between trustees and Arcadia, Green\u2019s retail group. She said the length of the recovery plan was \u201cvery atypical\u201d but that BHS \u201cdid not meet the threshold\u201d for a proactive investigation to be launched. Alan Rubenstein, chief executive of the Pension Protection Fund, which is set to take on the BHS pension scheme, said the recovery plan was scheduled for more than twice the average of nine years and \u201crather ambitious\u201d. He called on MPs to consider introducing a natural limit to recovery plans. Rubenstein also revealed that in 2012 Arcadia withdrew a guarantee it had put in place on the BHS pensions scheme after being told it was not as valuable as the company claimed. The BHS pension deficit was guaranteed by the assets of Davenbush, a company within Arcadia holding property, which allowed Arcadia to pay a smaller levy towards the PPF. However, Rubenstein said: \u201cIt [the guarantee] wasn\u2019t worthless, but it could not have withstood a claim for \u00a3200m [the deficit at the time].\u201d The PPF boss said the pensions system had been abused by companies looking to use guarantees to lower their PPF payments. The rules have subsequently been changed so that trustees must independently value the assets behind a guarantee. The PPF faces an initial hit of about \u00a3275m for taking on the BHS pension scheme. However, Rubenstein insisted the organisation could afford to take on BHS, and potentially the \u00a315bn pension scheme behind Tata Steel UK. He said they would not \u201cundermine our long-term viability\u201d. The PPF is funded by a levy paid by defined pension schemes across the UK. Companies usually agree to pay the levy on behalf of the pension scheme. In the UK, five out of six defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit. The total deficit is \u00a3300bn. A string of investigations have been launched into the collapse of BHS. On top of the inquiries by MPs, the Insolvency Service is examining BHS and the Serious Fraud Office is considering whether there are grounds to launch a formal investigation. Green is due to give evidence to MPs in June, while Chappell has also said he is willing to appear. Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions committee, has called in two of Green\u2019s bitterest former rivals to assist the parliamentary investigation into the collapse of BHS. Sir David Norgrove, who as chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s pension fund was instrumental in scuppering Green\u2019s attempted bid for the retailer in 2004, has been appointed special adviser. Paul Myners, who also fought off Green\u2019s bid as chairman of M&amp;S between 2004 and 2006 when the former BHS owner attempted a \u00a310bn takeover, has been appointed to lead a panel of financial assessors for the committee. Lord Myners has already filed 11 questions in the House of Lords calling on the government to investigate the demise of BHS. The appointments are likely to further ratchet up the dispute between Field and Green, which kicked off last week when the MP suggested the former BHS owner should be stripped of his knighthood if he did not put up funds to pay off the retailer\u2019s pension fund deficit. Green then called for Field\u2019s resignation, suggesting the MP was prejudiced against him. The tycoon added: \u201cClearly he has made his decision as to what he feels the punishment should be without even hearing any evidence from anybody about BHS or the circumstances of the last 15 years.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Pensions Regulator has admitted that it only found about the controversial sale of BHS by Sir Philip Green after reading about it in the newspapers.</p> <p>The revelation raises further questions about the nature of the sale to Dominic Chappell, who has been bankrupt three times, and the powers of the regulator.</p> <p>Lesley Titcomb, the regulator\u2019s chief executive, told MPs that the body had concerns about BHS since 2012, but an \u201canti-avoidance\u201d investigation into the funding of its pension scheme was only launched after the sale to Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions in March 2015.</p> <p>BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at up to \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia\">Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m</a> in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership and Retail Acquisitions receiving payments of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-owner-retail-acquisitions-25m-administration\">more than \u00a325m from BHS over the last 13 months</a>.</p> <p>The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell.</p> <p>Titcomb said that if the Pensions Regulator had been told of the sale it would have taken steps to ensure provisions had been taken for the pension scheme. She said the \u201canti-avoidance\u201d investigation \u2013 which could force Green to contribute towards the deficit \u2013 should make significant progress by the end of the year.</p> <p>However, the regulator was criticised by MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee and work and pensions committee, who are holding a joint investigation into the demise of BHS. Richard Fuller, the Conservative MP for Bedford and Kempston, said: \u201cFor good reasons or bad, you don\u2019t sound like much of a regulator.\u201d</p> <p>Titcomb said the body became concerned about BHS in 2012 after a 23-year recovery plan for the pension scheme was agreed between trustees and Arcadia, Green\u2019s retail group. She said the length of the recovery plan was \u201cvery atypical\u201d but that BHS \u201cdid not meet the threshold\u201d for a proactive investigation to be launched.</p> <p>Alan Rubenstein, chief executive of the Pension Protection Fund, which is set to take on the BHS pension scheme, said the recovery plan was scheduled for more than twice the average of nine years and \u201crather ambitious\u201d. He called on MPs to consider introducing a natural limit to recovery plans.</p> <p>Rubenstein also revealed that in 2012 Arcadia withdrew a guarantee it had put in place on the BHS pensions scheme after being told it was not as valuable as the company claimed.</p> <p>The BHS pension deficit was guaranteed by the assets of Davenbush, a company within Arcadia holding property, which allowed Arcadia to pay a smaller levy towards the PPF.</p> <p>However, Rubenstein said: \u201cIt [the guarantee] wasn\u2019t worthless, but it could not have withstood a claim for \u00a3200m [the deficit at the time].\u201d</p> <p>The PPF boss said the pensions system had been abused by companies looking to use guarantees to lower their PPF payments. The rules have subsequently been changed so that trustees must independently value the assets behind a guarantee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f87f65a53562e1ae281532249936b4efc569a67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f87f65a53562e1ae281532249936b4efc569a67/0_271_2078_1246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Philip Green sold BHS for \u00a31.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Philip Green sold BHS for \u00a31.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The PPF faces an initial hit of about \u00a3275m for taking on the BHS pension scheme. However, Rubenstein insisted the organisation could afford to take on BHS, and potentially the \u00a315bn pension scheme behind Tata Steel UK. He said they would not \u201cundermine our long-term viability\u201d.</p> <p>The PPF is funded by a levy paid by defined pension schemes across the UK. Companies usually agree to pay the levy on behalf of the pension scheme. In the UK, five out of six defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit. The total deficit is \u00a3300bn.</p> <p>A string of investigations have been launched into the collapse of BHS.

The short answer is the Pensions Regulator did not think it was its job to stop him \u2013 and, indeed, it may have been unable to do anything even if it had wanted to stick its nose in. Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, told MPs she found out about the sale of BHS to Retail Acquisitions for \u00a31 in March 2015 by reading about the deal in the newspapers. This was despite the regulator having concerns about the funding of the BHS scheme as far back as 2012. \u201cYou\u2019re not much of a regulator are you,\u201d jabbed one MP. Titcomb, naturally, didn\u2019t agree, but the description was surely fair. The impression created by Monday\u2019s hearing is that the Pensions Regulator is stuffed with theoretical powers that it rarely bothers to use. Instead, it likes facilitation, engagement and flexibility \u2013 anything, in fact, to avoid throwing its weight around. In the BHS case, this hands-off approach was doubly amazing since the warning signs were obvious in 2012 when the pension fund trustees signed off an arrangement whereby the company would take 23 years to attempt to close a deficit that then stood at \u00a3200m. That period was \u201catypical\u201d, conceded Titcomb, but no consequences followed at the time. Instead, after learning that BHS had been sold, it opened an anti-avoidance inquiry that has still not reached any conclusions. Green \u2013 probably \u2013 will still end up being roasted by the MPs, as he should be. But what we learned on Monday was frightening. It seems the Pensions Regulator\u2019s role is to wait until things go wrong and then launch a leisurely inquiry. Princely sums at VW Finally, somebody with a stake in Volkswagen\u2019s future has said the way the top brass in Wolfsburg pay themselves is ridiculous. The fact he is hedge fund manager Chris Hohn, who in a previous German outing found himself branded a \u201clocust\u201d by the chairman of Deutsche B\u00f6rse, may not advance the cause. Never mind. The spiky head of TCI Fund Management, who says he speaks for a 2% interest in the carmaker, is correct when he says payments of \u20ac400m (\u00a3316m) over six years to nine members of VW\u2019s management board represent \u201ccorporate excess on an epic scale\u201d. Indeed, the most striking figure in Hohn\u2019s blistering letter is the detail that VW\u2019s head of trucks made \u20ac15m in 2015 whereas the entire eight-strong executive board of Swedish lorry firm Scania, before it was absorbed into VW in 2014, received a combined \u20ac7m. Hohn argues that excessive pay for management, unlinked to clear performance targets, has \u201cencouraged aggressive management behaviour, contributing to the diesel-emission scandal\u201d. That is hard to prove definitively but is a reasonable thesis since VW\u2019s post-scandal stance on pay has been to carry on as if nothing had happened. The management board received \u20ac63m last year, only a modest reduction from 2014, and the basis for awarding bonuses was as unfathomable as ever. Hohn suspects a cosy stitch-up, going back years, in which management knew they could get away with paying themselves princely sums as long as they protected jobs and increased wages, and thus didn\u2019t upset the trade union representatives on VW\u2019s supervisory board. Again, he\u2019s probably right. Whatever the explanation, it would be a good thing if the few shareholders outside the VW\u2019s tight circle of control \u2013 the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families, the state of Lower Saxony, the Qataris and the unions \u2013 joined Hohn in making a fuss over corporate governance. Sausage rolls on a roll It wasn\u2019t Greggs\u2019 greatest few months of recent years but a 3.7% increase in like-for-like sales was better than most of the high street is managing. The reinvention of a chain of bakeries as a food-on-the-go merchant continues apace, even if the corporate musing about the wonders of the teriyaki chicken noodles was an unnecessary adornment; one suspects the sausage rolls are not about to be replaced. Indeed, Greggs\u2019 success makes you wonder why the supermarkets, as they tried to enter this territory, didn\u2019t try to copy the cheap-and-cheeful offer. Instead, Tesco gave us Harris + Hoole, which was pitched at the \u201cartisan\u201d end of the market, complete with obligatory references to being \u201cpassionate\u201d about coffee. Greggs no-nonsense style was the one to imitate.",

Again, he\u2019s probably right.</p> <p>Whatever the explanation, it would be a good thing if the few shareholders outside the VW\u2019s tight circle of control \u2013 the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families, the state of Lower Saxony, the Qataris and the unions \u2013 joined Hohn in making a fuss over corporate governance. </p> <h2>Sausage rolls on a roll</h2> <p>It wasn\u2019t Greggs\u2019 greatest few months of recent years but a 3.7% increase in like-for-like sales was better than most of the high street is managing. The reinvention of a chain of bakeries as a food-on-the-go merchant continues apace, even if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/09/salads-and-flat-whites-boost-greggs-despite-high-street-lull\">the corporate musing about the wonders of the teriyaki chicken noodles</a> was an unnecessary adornment; one suspects the sausage rolls are not about to be replaced.<br></p> <p>Indeed, Greggs\u2019 success makes you wonder why the supermarkets, as they tried to enter this territory, didn\u2019t try to copy the cheap-and-cheeful offer. Instead, Tesco gave us Harris + Hoole, which was pitched at the \u201cartisan\u201d end of the market, complete with obligatory references to being \u201cpassionate\u201d about coffee. Greggs no-nonsense style was the one to imitate.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A former Topshop finance chief, along with a one-time managing director of Deutsche Bank, have been found guilty of insider dealing in one of the UK\u2019s most high-profile cases. Eight years after the investigation began, Andrew Hind, 56, who was finance director at Topshop in the 1990s, and his friend Martyn Dodgson, 44, who used to work in corporate broking at Deutsche and Lehman Brothers, were both convicted following a 12-week trial at Southwark crown court. The pair will be sentenced at a later date and face a maximum of seven years in prison as well as a confiscation order. The longest sentence handed down for being convicted of insider dealing in the UK is the four years given to Richard Joseph in 2013. The Financial Conduct Authority alleged that Dodgson had handed inside information he had discovered through his work to Hind, who was then alleged to have passed it on to two other men to trade on their behalf. It was alleged that the group, which also included another corporate broker, then split the profits, which the FCA claimed totalled \u00a37.4m. The three other alleged participants were all acquitted. They were: Andrew \u201cGrant\u201d Harrison, 46, who also worked in corporate broking and who was alleged to have played a similar role to Dodgson; Ben Anderson, 71, a day trader; and his former business partner, Iraj Parvizi, 50, who rose to prominence in the City after working in a Kent kebab shop. Anderson and Parvizi admitted adding their own funds to investments carried out on behalf of Hind, but both insisted they had no reason to suspect his stock picks were based on price-sensitive insider information. In order to be convicted of insider dealing in the UK, the jury has to be satisfied that defendants were aware they were trading on inside information. When arrested six years ago Dodgson, who was paid \u00a3601,000 as a managing director at Deutsche Bank, told police he had never had any involvement in share trading or spread-betting on shares. Prosecuting counsel told the court he had also said that \u201che would not dare to advise anyone on trading or spread-betting as it was too easy to lose a lot of money\u201d. On his keyring, though, investigators found the key for a secure metal box at his home in Hampstead, north London, which contained a specialist encrypted flash drive allowing users to store files and browse the internet without leaving a trace. Dodgson said he had not used the device in years and could not unlock it. By cross-checking other passwords the banker had used elsewhere, however, investigators were able to discover that the drive was opened by the password \u201cLamborghini55\u201d. The court was also told how the drive contained incriminating evidence including a spreadsheet detailing that listed coded references to the trades. Investigators also discovered Hind had bought six encrypted USB sticks, with three being found in a wall safe at his home. When asked for the passwords, he declined to provide them. Investigators have been unable to access the sticks. Dodgson is one of the most senior City figures ever to be charged with insider dealing. He moved to Deutsche Bank in October 2008 as a director and was later promoted, while he was also part of a Deutsche Bank team advising the government on its stakes in the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 May 2016. An earlier version described Andrew Hind as a former adviser to Sir Philip Green. We have been advised that Hind has never been an adviser to Green, or an employee of any company controlled by him. Hind was employed by the Arcadia group before Green and his family took control of the business.",

      "bodyText": "Seven firms are weighing up bids for Tata Steel\u2019s entire UK business, the company has revealed, raising hopes of a rescue deal that could save up to 12,000 jobs. Indian conglomerate Tata has been seeking a buyer since it said in March that a turnaround plan for its Port Talbot steelworks was \u201cunaffordable\u201d. Tata Steel UK received letters of intent from potential bidders last week and said on Monday that seven \u201chave been immediately taken forward to the next stage of the sale process\u201d. They include Liberty House, which bought two Scottish steel mills formerly owned by Tata last month, and Excalibur UK, a management buyout led by Port Talbot boss Stuart Wilkie. German steel-making group ThyssenKrupp and investment firm Greybull Capital, which recently bought Tata\u2019s long products business including its Scunthorpe operation, are also understood to be among the interested parties. Tata rejected offers from firms looking to cherrypick parts of the UK operation, adding that such bidders had been \u201cthanked for their participation in the process but informed that their expressions would not be taken forward currently\u201d. Instead it will focus on offers for all of Tata Steel UK, which employs around 12,000 people in Britain when stripping out the part of the business already sold to Greybull. The firms still in the frame are now to be given access to more information about the Tata Steel UK, which has blamed its struggles on the strong pound, cheap steel imports from China, high energy costs and business rates. Tata said the next stage of the sale process, set to include presentations by senior management, would help bidders \u201crapidly progress their interest to a binding stage\u201d. Koushik Chatterjee, finance director of Tata Steel, said the seven firms had been chosen via a \u201crobust initial assessment process with inputs received from the UK government whose views have been considered by the board\u201d. The government has been directly involved in the talks after the business secretary, Sajid Javid, said hundreds of millions of pounds in financial backing would be available \u201con commercial terms\u201d to potential buyers. Chatterjee said: \u201cThe sales process will continue as announced earlier in an expedited and robust manner to deliver greater clarity for all key stakeholders such as employees, customers and suppliers.\u201d The trade body UK Steel said the emergence of seven potential buyers showed that British steelmaking still had a future, despite the difficult conditions that had led to job losses and plant closures. Its director, Gareth Stace, said: \u201cI\u2019ve always believed the UK steel sector is viable, we were just hindered by the strong pound, underpriced imports mainly from China and also policy costs that our competitors even in Europe didn\u2019t face. \u201cWe continue to address all of those issues with government. We have seen that there is a sustainable future for the steel sector and for steelmaking in the UK.\u201d A spokesperson for the union Community said: \u201cThis news is yet further evidence of the significant interest that exists in the future of the UK steel industry. Community will continue to act as a responsible stakeholder in the sales process. \u201cWe will ensure that all potential investors recognise the importance of Tata\u2019s highly skilled workforce to any future success of the business.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "FTSE loses early gains as mining shares slump, with Anglo down 14%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After a fairly bright start, the weight of a slump in commodity prices finally took its toll on the London market. The FTSE 100 fell 10.89 points or 0.18% to 6114.81, with mining shares leading the declines as metal prices fell, with copper hitting a one month low. The catalyst was disappointing Chinese trade data, with imports and exports both falling by more than expected and renewing fears about a slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy. A strengthening of the dollar also hit commodity prices, knocking oil back after earlier gains which were partly due to the supply worries caused by the Canadian wildfires in its oil sands region. Analysts said any disruption from the wildfires was likely to be temporary. So Brent crude is currently down more than 3% at $43.89 a barrel. An uncertain start on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down around 35 points in early trading, did not help sentiment. Tony Cross, market strategist at Trustnet Direct, said: Wall Street has kicked off the session finding little to cheer and this seems to be dragging on sentiment, although once again we\u2019ve seen the commodity stocks left languishing off the back of those worryingly bad import numbers from China. Commodity stocks have been in focus as a result of this and also some see-sawing in terms of oil prices. Those fires in Canada had been lending some support earlier in the day but the fact Saudi Arabia is set to maintain its strategy of fighting for market share regardless of cost is winning out. So nine out of the leading top ten fallers in the FTSE 100 were commodity companies. Anglo American slumped nearly 14% to 559.5p, continuing its decline of the past few days, while Glencore was down almost 9% at 132.55p. Among the oil companies, BP fell 2.5% to 351.5p. Broker upgrades lifted AstraZeneca by 146p to 3944.5p and easyJet by 54p to \u00a314.70.

      "body": "<p>After a fairly bright start, the weight of a slump in commodity prices finally took its toll on the London market.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 10</strong>0 fell 10.89 points or 0.18% to 6114.81, with mining shares leading the declines as metal prices fell, with copper hitting a one month low. The catalyst was <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/08/chinese-economy-exports-fall-by-2-and-imports-by-11-in-april\">disappointing Chinese trade data</a></strong>, with imports and exports both falling by more than expected and renewing fears about a slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy.</p> <p>A strengthening of the dollar also hit commodity prices, knocking oil back after earlier gains which were partly due to the supply worries caused by the Canadian wildfires in its oil sands region. Analysts said any disruption from the wildfires was likely to be temporary. So Brent crude is currently down more than 3% at $43.89 a barrel.</p> <p>An uncertain start on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down around 35 points in early trading, did not help sentiment. Tony Cross, market strategist at Trustnet Direct, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wall Street has kicked off the session finding little to cheer and this seems to be dragging on sentiment, although once again we\u2019ve seen the commodity stocks left languishing off the back of those worryingly bad import numbers from China. Commodity stocks have been in focus as a result of this and also some see-sawing in terms of oil prices. Those fires in Canada had been lending some support earlier in the day but the fact Saudi Arabia is set to maintain its strategy of fighting for market share regardless of cost is winning out.</p> </blockquote> <p>So nine out of the leading top ten fallers in the FTSE 100 were commodity companies.</p> <p><strong>Anglo American</strong> slumped nearly 14% to 559.5p, continuing its decline of the past few days, while <strong>Glencor</strong><strong>e</strong> was down almost 9% at 132.55p. Among the oil companies, <strong>BP</strong> fell 2.5% to 351.5p.</p> <p>Broker upgrades lifted <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> by 146p to 3944.5p and easyJet by 54p to \u00a314.70. AstraZeneca also launched a \u20ac2.2bn bond issue which will be used for \u201cgeneral corporate purposes\u201d including possible repayment of debt.</p> <p>Positive updates pushed <strong>G4S</strong> 8.9p higher to 193.2p and iodine producer <strong>Iofina</strong> by 27% to 17.5p.</p> <p>Lower down the market, digital media and technology company <strong>Milestone</strong> finished 11% higher at 0.7p as it signed an agreement with footballer Louis Saha\u2019s Axis Stars, which helps sports stars around the world to manage their careers better.</p>",

The acquisition of Krispy Kreme for $21 a share, a 25% premium on Friday\u2019s closing share price, comes soon after JAB spent $30bn buying up coffee companies across the world. JAB\u2019s coffee empire ranges from Douwe Egberts and Keurig coffee pods found in hotel rooms to some hipster-favourite brands, including Portland\u2019s Stumptown Coffee Roasters and Chicago\u2019s Intelligentsia Coffee. Peter Harf, a senior partner at JAB who helps invests the fortunes of Wolfgang, Stefan, Renate and Matthias Reimann, said: \u201cWe are thrilled to have such an iconic brand as Krispy Kreme joining the JAB portfolio. This is yet another example of our commitment to investing in extraordinary brands with significant growth prospects.

This transaction puts us in the best possible position to continue to spread that joy to a growing number of people around the world while delivering significant value to Krispy Kreme shareholders. I am confident the JAB team is the right partner with whom to continue building upon our incredible legacy.\u201d As well as coffee, the Reimann siblings also own fashion labels Jimmy Choo, Belstaff and Bally; 77% of Coty, the perfume company that owns scents branded Calvin Klein, David Beckham and Vera Wang; and 8% of consumer goods conglomerate Reckitt Benckiser. Collectively, the Reimanns are worth $19bn, according to Forbes magazine. They are descendants of the German chemist Ludwig Reimann. He inherited chemical giant Benckiser after marrying one of the daughters of the company founded by Johann Adam Benckiser (JAB). Benckiser merged with Britain\u2019s Reckitt and Colman to create Reckitt Benckiser in 1999. In 2006, the Reimanns gave up their German passports for Austrian ones in order to reduce their tax bill when the family offices were moved from Ludwigshafen, near Frankfurt, to Vienna.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s that time of year again. Greece is running out of money. There are violent protests in Athens. Eurozone finance ministers are gathering in Brussels in an \u201cemergency\u201d conclave to decide what to do next. The International Monetary Fund has already made it clear what it thinks should happen. It says Europe should cut Greece some slack by easing the terms of its bailout agreement and offering a solid dose of debt relief. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, has said that if Germany and its allies in the Eurogroup of finance ministers insist on making unrealistic demands of Greece she will not risk any more of the fund\u2019s money. This makes sense because it appears clear to all but the hardliners that the situation in Greece has become a mixture of the tragic and the absurd. Tragic, because the economy has shrunk by a quarter in the past eight years \u2013 equivalent to the contraction that the US suffered in the Great Depression \u2013 and the unemployment rate is 24.4%. Absurd because most of the \u20ac86bn (\u00a368bn) that has been earmarked for Greece \u2013 provided it pushes through a raft of demand-destroying measures \u2013 will go straight out again to pay the country\u2019s main creditors: the European Central Bank and the IMF. And with each bailout (this is the third since 2010), Greece\u2019s debt mountain gets bigger. There are three possible ways forward. One is to conclude that Greece needs to find a way of paying off the money it has borrowed, and so set stiff repayment terms. Under pressure last summer, when its banks were closed and the country was running out of cash, Greece agreed it would run a primary budget surplus (an excess of tax receipts over public spending once debt repayments have been excluded) of 3.5% of GDP by 2018 and in every year thereafter. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, says Greece should stick to its promises. Lagarde says this is unworkable. Her argument is that very few European countries have a commitment to run primary budget surpluses of 3.5% in perpetuity and that Greece is not one of them. The IMF chief thinks the target is going to be difficult to achieve and will be counter-productive. She wants a second option: the target to be reduced to 1.5% of GDP and for Europe to offer relief on Greece\u2019s national debt, now running at 180% of GDP. The IMF thinks anything above 120% of GDP is unsustainable. Because it believes there is not the remotest possibility of Greece running such big budget surpluses, the IMF says it will only take part in the bailout if Athens agrees to contingent cuts worth a further \u20ac3.5bn that will be triggered if the fiscal targets are missed. Predictably enough, this has not gone down well either with the Syriza-led government, hanging on to power by its fingernails, or the Greek public. That leads to the third option: Greece runs out of money and defaults. This was a situation only narrowly averted last summer and on his way into Monday\u2019s meeting, Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants a repeat of summer 2015.\u201d Schelling spoke for many, including David Cameron, who could certainly do with Greece being out of the headlines for the next six weeks. Britain\u2019s referendum means that the eurozone has to act with unaccustomed speed and sort Greece out within a fortnight.

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has urged Germany to do more to help find work for the hundreds of thousands of refugees in the country, saying such moves would help counter the effects of an ageing population. The country should also make the most of low borrowing costs to bolster spending on infrastructure, the IMF said in its annual assessment of Europe\u2019s largest economy, known as an article IV report. The IMF said Germany\u2019s economic growth this year was expected to \u201cremain moderate as strong domestic demand buoyed by favourable fiscal and monetary conditions is offsetting weak external demand\u201d. But the potential medium-term growth was forecast to drop as the population aged. As such Germany needed to push through structural reforms, the IMF said. One key concern was the potential pressure on Germany\u2019s labour market. \u201cThe projected decline in the labour force due to ageing after 2020 calls for measures to boost labour supply in the medium term. Additional policies to integrate the current wave of refugees into the labour market, to broaden opportunities for full-time employment of women, and to extend working lives, would be important in this regard,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cThese reforms would not only counter the projected growth decline in the medium term but also stimulate private consumption and investment in the short term.\u201d German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s open-door policy towards refugees fleeing the Syrian conflict resulted in Europe\u2019s most populous state accepting nearly one in two asylum applications made by Syrians in EU member states last year. The IMF praised how Germany had integrated refugees into its labour market and noted \u201cmany supportive measures have been taken and more are under way\u201d. But more support was needed. \u201cThe government has helpfully removed a number of restrictions to access to employment and training for asylum seekers and persons with a temporary suspension of deportation. Policy measures to allow recognition of informally acquired skills and facilitate more flexible forms of vocational training, with a strong on-the-job component and intensive language teaching, should be strengthened,\u201d the IMF said. It also called for further reforms, such as better childcare and after-school provision, to enable more women to work full-time. Pension changes to promote longer working lives would also help \u201cbring the double dividend of increasing employment while reducing old-age poverty\u201d, the IMF said. The IMF\u2019s call for more private and public investment in Germany chimes with its recent warnings that politicians cannot rely solely on low interest rates and money printing programmes from central banks to shore up growth. The IMF director, Christine Lagarde, warned last month that the global economy was more fragile and urged governments to pursue growth-friendly policies.",

      "bodyText": "HMV has reclaimed is position as the second biggest entertainment retailer in the UK as high street chains enjoy a revival against their online competitors. HMV recorded a 2% year-on-year rise in sales of music, DVDs and games over the last quarter, giving it a market share of 16.9%, ahead of Tesco\u2019s 16.1%. The figures represent HMV\u2019s best performance since it collapsed into administration more than three years ago. It was eventually rescued by Hilco, the investment firm. Overall, sales of entertainment products in bricks-and-mortar shops fell by 2% during the 12 weeks to 10 April, according to Kantar Worldpanel. However, online retailers suffered a much larger decline, with sales down by 12%. Amazon, the country\u2019s biggest entertainment retailer, saw its sales fall by 0.6% year-on-year, reducing its market share from 22.6% to 22%. Analysts said that high street entertainment stores were being underpinned by music and video games. One-in-four customers still only buy CDs, while 77% of video games were bought at shops during the quarter. Tesco and Game achieved their biggest share of video game sales for five years. This helped high street stores and supermarkets to claim 69.8% of spending on all physical entertainment products, up from 67.5% a year ago. Fiona Keenan, strategic insight director at Kantar, said: \u201cDespite recent high profile casualties for high street fashion retailers the performance of bricks and mortar entertainment stores has demonstrated the strong appeal this channel still holds for consumers. \u201cSome 14% of the population now has a music subscription service and paid-for Spotify subscriptions are growing at 25%. Yet the CD is still the most popular way to consume music content. \u201cSuch a strong performance from HMV has not been seen since it entered administration in 2013. HMV has really focused on creating an in-store environment that stimulates and excites consumers like it did in its heyday. \u201cThis focus is clearly reflected in the fact that over half of its sales this quarter came from customers who hadn\u2019t planned to make a purchase \u2013 significantly higher than the market average of 38%.\u201d Across the industry, music sales dipped by 1% during the period, with DVDs down 6% and games down 8%. Popular products include David Bowie\u2019s albums Blackstar and Best of Bowie following his death in January, as well as the compilation Now That\u2019s What I Call Music! 93 and Adele\u2019s 25. The best-selling DVD during the period was Spectre, the latest James Bond film, which has sold more than 1.7m copies since it went on sale in February.",

      "bodyText": "King Canute is alive and well in Britain. While solar energy has become a global success story over the past few years, with tumbling costs and exploding deployment, Britain, which was keen on the technology, has slammed on the brakes, casting a shadow over a sector which employed more than 30,000 people but is now shedding jobs by the thousand. The big picture on solar is, well, big. Last year $161bn (\u00a3111bn) was invested around the world, more than gas and coal combined. Europe will reach a 100GW peak of solar deployed this year, enough to supply about one-fifth of the European Union population with clean power. Britain experienced a surge and now has 10GW, with 800,000 homeowners enjoying the technology\u2019s indisputable benefits. We now produce 25% of our electricity from renewables \u2013 10% from solar, with the rest mainly wind power. This is more power than we get from coal, something unthinkable just a few years ago. Solar is jobs-intensive and many small and medium-sized firms have grown to meet the demand and build up skills they are now deploying around the world \u2013 a success story at every level. But the government ditched support for solar farms last year, worrying they might push some Tory voters in the shires into the arms of Ukip. Once rid of the renewables-friendly Liberal Democrats, the new Conservative government got out the wrecking ball. It also slashed support for roof-mounted solar, leading installation volumes to collapse by 80% so far this year. The only renewable left standing was offshore wind, although it is much more expensive than onshore wind or solar, and receives a lot of government largesse. I am a fan of all renewables, but the government justifies its slashing of support for onshore wind and solar due to the cost of \u201csubsidies\u201d, as it wrongly labels the feed-in tariff or renewables obligation \u2013 mechanisms which have driven huge cost reductions. Subsidies in the true sense keep prices high and industries inefficient. Remember the EU wine lakes and butter mountains. Think, too, of the huge price being offered to Hinkley Point C nuclear station for its power up until 2060. That\u2019s a massive subsidy, as well as a burden on future generations, which will do nothing to bring costs down; quite the reverse. The energy secretary, Amber Rudd, says solar must stand on its own two feet. We in the industry agree and have all been merciless in bearing down on costs, which are down 80% over the past five years. But it is downright dishonest of the government to call for free markets without support but reserved solely for solar or onshore wind. The truth is that Britain is not a free market economy. It remains a corporatist economy run by big firms that love big solutions such as offshore wind farms (no SMEs there) or nuclear power stations. Conventional energy corporations, scared to death of the massive drop in the cost of solar, tell ministers that renewables can never be the solution. Pity the facts belie this nonsense, but the Tories have swallowed it. Solar is only a couple of years away from not needing any support at all, but still the government wants to prevent it even surviving that far. They are allocating \u00a312m a year support for the next three years \u2013 only about 1.5% of the support available to other technologies under the so-called Levy Control Framework, the details of which the government scandalously refuses to reveal. The government is not the only problem. In 2013 the EU mandated a minimum price for Chinese solar panels. This has prevented costs falling rapidly in lockstep with incentives reductions and slashed margins. Moreover, wholesale electricity prices have tumbled along with oil prices and so solar plants can earn less from the power they sell. Britain\u2019s electricity grid is a problem too. It is weak and has little capacity left for renewables to connect. Thus grid connections are scarce and expensive. Will solar survive in the UK? Well, storage technology is rapidly advancing and costs are falling. With the grid a mess, solar with storage will enable lots of warehouses and factories to be provided with clean power where and when they need it. The next couple of years will be tough, and deployment a fraction of recent levels. But fear not \u2013 the tough, innovative, solar industry will be around long after this Canute-like government has been and gone. \u2022Ashley Seager is director of Sun4net Ltd and a former Guardian economics correspondent.",

      "bodyText": "Young adults in the UK are facing inflation rates three times higher than those for pensioners, according to a new analysis that highlights the pressures of the cost of living on millennials. The widening generational inflation gap is being driven by under-30s spending proportionally more on things that are getting more expensive, such as education, dining out, rent and household bills, according to Fidelity International. At the same time, those in the demographic spend less of their budget on groceries compared with older generations, so they have not enjoyed the same boost from falling food prices. The under-30s experienced an inflation rate of 0.9% in March, compared with an official headline rate of 0.5%, according to analysts at Fidelity who used official inflation figures for different goods and services and the consumption patterns of different age groups. By contrast, the inflation rate was just 0.3% for the over-65s. It was 0.4% for both the 30-49 age bracket and for the baby boomer 50-64 age group. The findings will underscore warnings about the rising pressures on younger people as they struggle to get on the housing ladder, pay off student dent and cover their living costs while pay growth is so weak. The inflation rate in the UK was close to zero for most of last year when measured on the consumer prices index and it remains low. But headline figures were not telling the full story, said Maike Currie, the investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International. \u201cScratch beneath the surface and there is a clear generational divide when it comes to the cost of living. Millennials can be dubbed \u2018Generation Inflation\u2019,\u201d said Currie. She noted that under-30s were spending a greater proportion of their income on the areas that have seen the highest price increases \u2013 education and housing. \u201cThis leaves them with little left to save and the challenge of generating higher returns to keep up with the pace of inflation. Unfortunately for millennials this challenge is being met with equally low wage growth \u2013 wages remained below their pre-crisis average in 2015 despite unemployment falling back, which means this group is also hit by negative real earnings growth.\u201d The analysis is the first part of a series on generational inflation rates. The authors found the trend for younger people to face faster living cost rises than the average went back to September 2014, and that other generations had tracked the average UK inflation rate more closely. Figures on spending patterns suggest millennials prefer spending on experiences, so a bigger slice of their income \u2013 14% \u2013 is spent on dining out and other activities with only 8% spent on groceries and soft drinks. So the supermarket price war and rise of discount grocers such as Aldi and Lidl has done comparatively less for the younger generation\u2019s finances. The age group also spends proportionally more on housing, at 19%, than any other generation, Fidelity said. The analysis used CPI, which includes changes to the cost of renting but not to the cost of repaying a mortgage. However, with base rates stuck at a record low, mortgage costs have been falling on average.",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Bailey, the incoming head of the Financial Conduct Authority, said improving the culture of City firms is a priority and that \u201chubris\u201d needs to be added to the list of risks firms face. Giving his last speech as a deputy governor of the Bank of England before taking up his role at the FCA, Bailey pointed to the over-confidence of the management at major banks as a cause for the taxpayer bailouts and billion of pounds in fines for misconduct in recent years. \u201cWe talk often about credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, conduct risk in its several forms. You can add to that, hubris risk, the risk of blinding over-confidence ... It is a risk that can be magnified by broader social attitudes,\u201d Bailey told delegates at the City Week conference on Monday. Even so, he said the City was not being given enough credit for changes in behaviour since the financial crisis. \u201cTen years ago there was considerable reverence towards, and little questioning of, the ability of banks and bankers to make money or of whether boards demonstrated a sufficient diversity of view and outlook to sustain challenge. How things have changed,\u201d he added. Bailey, who as deputy governor of the Bank is also head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, is joining the FCA in July after George Osborne pushed out Martin Wheatley in a move that was regarded as a softening in the government\u2019s stance toward banks. Wheatley\u2019s temporary replacement Tracey McDermott was criticised in December for dropping a review into banking culture. The current head of the PRA said that the culture and people in banks mattered \u201ca great deal\u201d to financial regulators. \u201cCulture has a major influence on the outcomes that matter to us as regulators. My assessment of recent history is that there has not been a case of a major prudential or conduct failing in a firm which did not have among its root causes a failure of culture as manifested in governance, remuneration, risk management or tone from the top,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cCulture has thus laid the ground for bad outcomes, for instance where management are so convinced of their rightness that they hurtle for the cliff without questioning the direction of travel.\u201d He said that the public perception of banking, and some other areas of finance, was that the industry was still focused too much on \u201cgreed is good\u201d. \u201cMajor changes have occurred since the crisis which have improved behaviour in firms, but public opinion broadly does not recognise these developments and tends to think that nothing has changed. Culture is an important part of demonstrating that change,\u201d Bailey said. But, he added: \u201cAs regulators, we are not able, and should not try, to determine the culture of firms. We cannot write a regulatory rule that settles culture.\u201d Speaking later at the City Week conference, Chris Cummings, chief executive of the CityUK lobby group, said that he had been told by US bankers that the attitude of regulatory regime in the UK was returning to normal. \u201cMy sense is the industry has weathered the tsunami of regulation,\u201d Cummings said.",

      "bodyText": "IPhone supplier Imagination Technologies has jumped nearly 13% following news that a Chinese state-backed business has taken a 3% stake in the chip designer. The news of the move by Tsinghua Unigroup has prompted speculation the company - which also counts Apple as a shareholder - could be a possible takeover target. Earlier this year Apple said it had held talks but did not plan to make an offer \u201cat this time.\u201d Analyst Roger Phillips at Investec said: The announcement of Tsinghua Unigroup as 3% holders will likely reignite M&amp;A speculation around Imagination once again. We update our numbers to account for new management cost cutting and Apple\u2019s quarterly numbers last week. The latter were not pretty for iPhone units for the June quarter, and there are a few tricky quarters in store here, but Mediatek share regain, Spreadtrum progress and management action on cost should offset. We remain buyers with an upgraded 200p price target. He added: Tsinghua Unigroup\u2019s acquisition of a 3% stake is interesting considering this is the Chinese state-backed technology holding company that acquired RDA Microelectronics and Spreadtrum... The idea that the Chinese state\u2019s acquisition of intellectual property is a strategic priority, and that Imagination could be a target, has been floated before, but considered slightly left-field. As a result, the announcement brings this idea to the forefront, with Tsinghua having stated in press reports that it expects to invest around $47bn in the next five years, and reignites M&amp;A speculation over Imagination more generally. Analysts at Liberum said: Tsinghua Holdings has taken a 3% stake in Imagination. Tsinghua is a near $30bn Chinese state-owned fund that has been buying western technology companies. Tsinghua has already acquired Spreadtrum, RDA, HP\u2019s server business and tried to buy Micron, Spil and Western Digital. We presume Apple (owns 8%) would not let Imagination\u2019s technology go to China. This may ignite a sale process. The last four intellectual property acquisitions (Tensilica, MIPS, Arc, Artisan) have been at 7.7 times enterprise value/sales on average. Imagination trades on 3.3 times enterprise value/sales. So Imagination\u2019s shares have climbed 19.5p to 170.5p . Apple holds an 8.3% stake in Imagination, although US semiconductor group Intel sold its remaining shares early last year.",

      "bodyText": "Greggs\u2019 business suffered in March when high streets went quiet during the cold weather but the baker said business had recovered as it sold more breakfasts, hot sandwiches and flat-white coffees. The Newcastle-based company said it had made a good start to the year with total sales up 5.9% in the first 18 weeks of 2016 and sales at stores open a year or more up 3.7%. Sales growth at established stores was considerably weaker than the 6% rate in the same period last year. Greggs said it was affected by the widespread lull in retail activity as cold, damp weather and wintry storms affected much of the country. Next, the fashion retailer, partly blamed the weather last week as it cut its guidance for annual sales despite a recent pick-up in trading. Greggs said it was sticking by its expectations for the year and its shares rose 4.5% to \u00a311.16. Greggs has been revamping its shops and products to include healthier options as well as the sausage rolls and pasties for which it is best known. The baker has thrived by tapping into the coffee boom and opening stores early to sell breakfast items such as free-range omelettes and porridge. Salad sales at Greggs\u2019 1,720 stores were strong in the first few months of this year as the company added teriyaki chicken noodle and falafel with hummus to its range. Financial performance was helped by muted price rises for ingredients, helping to offset higher wage costs. In a trading update before Tuesday\u2019s annual general meeting, Greggs said: \u201cAs has been widely reported, conditions on the high street were softer in March before recovering in recent weeks. These conditions were reflected in our own performance. \u201cOur hot sandwich range and extended breakfast menu have proved particularly popular and the introduction of our flat-white coffee is helping to continue our delivery of double-digit growth in sales of hot drinks.\u201d Greggs, whose fans include the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, could become the latest company to face opposition to executive pay at the AGM in Newcastle. Pirc, the shareholder advisory group, has recommended a vote against Greggs\u2019 remuneration report, arguing chief executive Roger Whiteside\u2019s pay is too high. Whiteside\u2019s earnings more than doubled last year to \u00a32.6m as he received \u00a31.4m under the company\u2019s long-term incentive scheme. Pirc said \u00a31.95m of performance-based pay was too high compared with Whiteside\u2019s salary of \u00a3507,000 and that, at 79 times the earnings of the average Greggs employee, his pay was inappropriate. At last year\u2019s AGM Greggs\u2019 remuneration report passed with almost 100% support from shareholders who voted, but the mood of investors has hardened against high pay levels with a series of high-profile revolts starting with BP last month. Greggs rewarded Whiteside for making cost cuts last year when the company announced the closure of three bakeries, in Twickenham, Edinburgh and Sleaford, with the loss of 355 jobs. After a consultation period, Greggs is closing the Sleaford site and Twickenham and Edinburgh will shut by the middle of next year. Greggs said: \u201cOur people impacted by these proposals have demonstrated their commitment and professionalism during a difficult period and our focus now is to work with them individually to ensure that we manage these changes in line with Greggs\u2019 values as a responsible employer.\u201d",

The revelation contradicts the dire warnings of the Turnbull government that any changes to negative gearing would destroy confidence in the economy and send house prices plummeting. \u201cAny change which discourages negative gearing may be a good thing from an FS perspective,\u201d the RBA document says, with FS standing for financial stability. \u201cThe concessional rate of taxation of capital gains might encourage leverage speculation, particularly in combination with negative gearing provisions.\u201d The four-page document, which was posted on the RBA\u2019s website on 4 May, appears to have been heavily redacted and addresses issues in the Financial System Inquiry, which released its final report in December 2014. The document answers questions regarding possible implications from changing negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. It is not clear who submitted the FoI request. The Labor party wants to limit negative gearing to new properties, and cut the capital gains tax discount from 50% to 25%, to make housing more affordable by slowing the pace of house price growth. The Grattan Institute has also proposed negative gearing changes, saying the CGT discount should be reduced from 50% to 25% and negatively geared investors should no longer be allowed to deduct losses on their investments from labour income. It believes house prices would be unlikely to fall by more than about 2% as a consequence. But the prime minster, Malcolm Turnbull, and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, have vigorously attacked such proposals. They have said such changes would \u201cdeliver a reckless trifecta of lower home values, higher rents and less investment\u201d. \u201cDriving down the value of the most important asset for most Australians is not a strategy for economic growth and enhanced prosperity,\u201d they have warned. Morrison has subsequently warned any changes would \u201ccrash\u201d confidence in the economy because by undermining property values. Turnbull has promised not to make any changes to negative gearing or the capital gain tax discount going into the election. The FoI document shows that when asked if there could be any negative consequences from changes that make negative gearing less attractive to investors, RBA officials answered: \u201cPotential increase in rents? Large-scale sale of negatively geared properties? \u2013 though only if changes were not grandfathered.\u201d Turnbull has said rents would soar if Labor\u2019s negative gearing policy was introduced. The revelation comes as analysts predict the Reserve Bank could be forced to cut interest rates to 1% as it tries to engineer stronger prices and pull Australia out of a deflationary spiral. Despite reasonable economic growth, many experts now expect the RBA will cut again to 1.5% before spring and may even be forced as low as 1%. The lower rates would be a major boost for mortgage holders struggling with record household debt combined with stagnating earnings, but it would be bad news for the ranks of retirees and savers.",

    "webTitle": "Nationwide raises mortgage borrowing age limit to 85", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nationwide is to raise the maximum age limit for its mortgages from 75 to 85, the highest of any major lender, in a change of policy that it says reflects Britain\u2019s ageing population. The building society\u2019s move leapfrogs Halifax, which last week raised its age limit to 80. Many older borrowers have struggled to obtain mortgages, despite changes to employment habits, with many workers staying in their jobs until the age of 70 or more. Nationwide will grant mortgages of up to \u00a3150,000 to older borrowers if they can prove they have enough of a pension to afford the repayments. The last age at which the society will grant a mortgage is 80 years old, to run for five years. But the higher age limits are only open to borrowers who can prove that the loan will be no more than 60% of the value of their home. Mortgage broker Aaron Strutt of Trinity Financial said: \u201cUntil now, people aged in their early 60s have usually been turned down by the big banks, offered at most a five to 10 year term, which makes it impossibly expensive. They have had to abandon the idea or go to the smaller building societies and pay higher rates. \u201cI said that other lenders will follow Halifax\u2019s lead but I did not expect Nationwide to act quite so quickly.\u201d The longer age limits massively improve the affordability of loans for older borrowers. For example, a \u00a3100,000 mortgage at age 65, which has to be repaid by the age of 75, costs \u00a3966 a month at a 3% interest rate. But if the borrower can extend it to the age of 85, the cost comes down to just \u00a3555 a month. Henry Jordan, Nationwide head of mortgages, said: \u201cWe are taking a series of steps to meet a growing demand from customers to be able to borrow in later life. These customers are often asset rich, with significant equity in their home, and they wish to have the flexibility to borrow against it. \u201cAccess to the mainstream market has been a challenge for older customers, resulting in their needs going unfulfilled. This measure helps to address these needs in a prudent, controlled manner.\u201d But the loosening of age restrictions will prompt concerns about the rise of \u201cthe Bank of Granny and Granddad\u201d. Nationwide said the mortgages will be granted for \u201ca range of mortgage borrowing needs, including house purchase and further advances,\u201d but it\u2019s likely that some of the money will be passed to grandchildren to help them buy property. Last week Barclays reintroduced 100% mortgages \u2013 so long as relatives also put up funds \u2013 prompting some to warn of a new housing divide between buyers able to access parental or grandparent assistance and others left to rent in perpetuity. The moves will also enable older borrowers to access the 35 and even 40-year mortgage terms now becoming common among younger first time buyers. Halifax said the proportion of first-time buyers taking a 35-year mortgage rather than a 25-year deal has increased from 16% to 25% in the last eight years alone, as borrowers have stretched themselves to be able to buy. Following Halifax\u2019s amendments to its criteria, someone who is 45 will be able to take a 35-year mortgage, although they will have to prove they will have sufficient pension in retirement to afford it. Rising house prices and the need to save for large deposits has meant that the average age at which buyers purchase their first home has risen to 31, with many borrowers facing paying mortgages well into their later years.",

      "body": "<p>Nationwide is to raise the maximum age limit for its mortgages from 75 to 85, the highest of any major lender, in a change of policy that it says reflects Britain\u2019s ageing population. <br></p> <p>The building society\u2019s move leapfrogs Halifax, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/06/halifax-raises-mortgage-borrower-age-limit-80\">which last week raised its age limit to 80</a>. Many older borrowers have struggled to obtain mortgages, despite changes to employment habits, with many workers staying in their jobs until the age of 70 or more. </p> <p>Nationwide will grant mortgages of up to \u00a3150,000 to older borrowers if they can prove they have enough of a pension to afford the repayments. The last age at which the society will grant a mortgage is 80 years old, to run for five years. </p> <p>But the higher age limits are only open to borrowers who can prove that the loan will be no more than 60% of the value of their home. <br></p> <p>Mortgage broker Aaron Strutt of Trinity Financial said: \u201cUntil now, people aged in their early 60s have usually been turned down by the big banks, offered at most a five to 10 year term, which makes it impossibly expensive. They have had to abandon the idea or go to the smaller building societies and pay higher rates.</p> <p>\u201cI said that other lenders will follow Halifax\u2019s lead but I did not expect Nationwide to act quite so quickly.\u201d</p> <p>The longer age limits massively improve the affordability of loans for older borrowers. For example, a \u00a3100,000 mortgage at age 65, which has to be repaid by the age of 75, costs \u00a3966 a month at a 3% interest rate. But if the borrower can extend it to the age of 85, the cost comes down to just \u00a3555 a month. </p> <p>Henry Jordan, Nationwide head of mortgages, said: \u201cWe are taking a series of steps to meet a growing demand from customers to be able to borrow in later life. These customers are often asset rich, with significant equity in their home, and they wish to have the flexibility to borrow against it.</p> <p>\u201cAccess to the mainstream market has been a challenge for older customers, resulting in their needs going unfulfilled. This measure helps to address these needs in a prudent, controlled manner.\u201d</p> <p>But the loosening of age restrictions will prompt concerns about the rise of \u201cthe Bank of Granny and Granddad\u201d. Nationwide said the mortgages will be granted for \u201ca range of mortgage borrowing needs, including house purchase and further advances,\u201d but it\u2019s likely that some of the money will be passed to grandchildren to help them buy property. </p> <p>Last week Barclays reintroduced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/04/barclays-100-per-cent-mortgage-how-much-does-it-really-help-homebuyers\">100% mortgages</a> \u2013 so long as relatives also put up funds \u2013 prompting some to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/05/barclays-mortgage-parents-wealthy-homeowning-divide\">warn of a new housing divide</a> between buyers able to access parental or grandparent assistance and others left to rent in perpetuity. </p> <p>The moves will also enable older borrowers to access the 35 and even 40-year mortgage terms now becoming common among younger first time buyers. </p> <p>Halifax said the proportion of first-time buyers taking a 35-year mortgage rather than a 25-year deal has increased from 16% to 25% in the last eight years alone, as borrowers have stretched themselves to be able to buy.</p> <p>Following Halifax\u2019s amendments to its criteria, someone who is 45 will be able to take a 35-year mortgage, although they will have to prove they will have sufficient pension in retirement to afford it. </p> <p>Rising house prices and the need to save for large deposits has meant that the average age at which buyers purchase their first home has risen to 31, with many borrowers facing paying mortgages well into their later years. </p>",
