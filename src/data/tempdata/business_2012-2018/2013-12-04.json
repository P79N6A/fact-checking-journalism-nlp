      "bodyText": "\"Customers are continuing to respond positively to the changes we are making to the UK business,\" says Tesco. But does the boast amount to much if same-store sales are falling and market share is still being lost to the likes of Waitrose, Aldi and Lidl? Naturally, chief executive Philip Clarke can point to many mini-triumphs, like the success of his Hudl computer tablets and gains in sales at stores that have received a makeover. Yet third quarter like-for-like sales fell 1.5% in Britain, a weaker performance even than the slow market. Two years into a \u00a31bn self-improvement plan and with a third of Tesco's floorspace now \"refreshed\", Clarke would surely have expected to be doing better. One dodgy quarter does not make a crisis and, predictably, he is sticking to his script that he is managing for the medium and long-term. Thus there will be no price war, even if he sounds less dogmatic than in the past about defending a 5.2% profit margin. It might be 4.8%, he said \u2013 but, then again, it might be 5.6%. The main thing, he argued, is to concentrate on the products and making the business fit for the multi-channel age. On paper, the ambition sounds splendid; and long-term thinking in boardrooms is generally to be applauded. Yet those analysts who argue there is a fundamental problem with Tesco's pricing policies, and thus its margin target, are surely on to something. The \"Tesco price promise\" \u2013 a pledge to match Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons on baskets containing at least 10 items \u2013 sends mixed signals to shoppers. Yes, some customers will find it reassuring. But every money-back coupon issued sends a message that the biggest supermarket in the land is not setting the pace on prices. Or, as Dave McCarthy, HSBC's analyst, puts it: \"There are many price promises and price-matching around the marketplace, but Tesco should be able to beat all its competition on price, even the hard discounters, on comparable products. Price matching is not market-leading behaviour ... and is not the foundation on which Tesco was built.\" The Tesco counterblast says the City is worrying unnecessarily and customers' perceptions of its prices are improving. It's the kind of boast that is credible only as long as profits arrive on target. \"We are performing in line with market expectations for the full year,\" said the company on Wednesday. If Clarke can make the same boast after Christmas, and throughout 2014, he may banish the doubters. But scepticism is the current mood. Rate-rigging regulation The winner in the latest rate-rigging scandal is the system of whistle-blowing. Barclays escaped a fine of \u20ac690m (\u00a3570m) for alerting the authorities to the Euribor cartel and UBS avoided a colossal \u20ac2.5bn (\u00a32bn) by doing the same in the yen equivalent. It may seem unsatisfactory that dastardly behaviour at both banks can result in a 100% discount on fines, plus an admission of wrongdoing. But the uncomfortable truth here is that regulators too often do not have sufficient resources to uncover cartels unless somebody is prepared to confess and provide evidence against co-conspirators. Barclays and UBS, whacked by heavy fines by national regulators for attempted Libor manipulation, appear to have run off to the European commission to tell all on the anti-competitive angle. Fair play to them. Like it or not, immunity from large fines is the system most likely to encourage whistle-blowing. The result in this case is that the sheer scale of the rate-rigging scandal starts to be seen. For the first time, Deutsche Bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Citigroup and JP Morgan have agreed fines. All, one assumes, will now face confrontations with national regulators whose interest, unlike the European Commission's, extends beyond the collusion aspects. By the same token, the three banks that have rejected a settlement on the Euribor investigation \u2013 HSBC, JP Morgan and Credit Agricole \u2013 deserve to get whacked extra hard if they fight their case and lose. HSBC says it will defend itself \"vigorously\" \u2013 it had better be sure of its case. Broker Icap is being investigated on the yen side. As for Royal Bank of Scotland, it was depressing, but not surprising, to find it appearing in both the euribor and yen cartels. \"Another sobering reminder of past failings,\" reflected chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who is having a very sober week.",

It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reshaping of the sector is well underway and the bulk of banks have announced material cost reduction programmes, involving the closure of branches and staff lay-offs. These efforts will flow through to lower costs next year, even though there is still work to be done with the completion of a number of outstanding M&amp;A transactions, disposals and further cost rationalisation.</p> <p>Reforms to clean up balance sheets, such as the transfer of real-estate loans of banks that were recapitalised to the state 'bad bank', and efforts to raise loan provisioning and classification standards, should also benefit asset quality.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it warned:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>However, as a percentage of loans, the weakening of the non-performing loans ratio is likely to be more pronounced if loan books continue to contract. This is probable because, for example, greater affordability after house price falls has been almost entirely offset by the rise in lending rates, higher transaction taxes and the end of fiscal incentives for home purchases. The economy remains weak, despite the earlier-than-expected exit from recession.</p> <p>The segments that pose the greatest risk to further non-performing loans deterioration are households and SMEs, in particular those with only limited access to export markets. Nevertheless, the scrutiny and extensive provisioning exercises of the Spanish banks means they are likely to do relatively well in the ECB's asset quality review and stress tests next year, depending on the criteria applied.</p> <p>We believe further capital building will be needed to offset potentially higher asset quality risks and weak earnings prospects. Higher standards under Basel III would also influence capital needs, as would the possibility of capital shortfalls arising from the ECB's assessments, which cannot be ruled out.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full report is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/detail.cfm?pr_id=810493&amp;origin=home\">Fitch Outlook: Spanish Bank Restructure Benefits to Crystallise</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-529f350be4b0acc591790b9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-04T14:06:03.971Z\">2.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier&#xa0;Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras and European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso held a joint press conference after a meeting bptween a Greek government delegation and the EU\u2019s 28-member College of Commissioners in Brussels.

On that note, it's time to wrap up. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow for another busy day. In a slight chance from the norm, my colleagues Graeme Wearden and Andrew Sparrow will be live blogging the UK autumn statement. Meanwhile I will be covering all the latest eurozone and business developments in a separate blog, including the Bank of England and European Central Bank's latest meetings. Until then, have a good evening. In Italy, the country's top court has ruled the current electoral law is unconstitutional. The move puts more pressure on the country's political parties to pass a reform of the system, which has been promised for years, said Reuters. It added: The constitutional court cited two aspects of the system that flouted the constitution, namely a winners' bonus of seats awarded to the largest coalition without a minimum threshold, and the fact that it does not allow voters to pick an individual candidate. Ahead of tomorrow's ECB gathering: European markets have closed for the day, and a downbeat session it has been too. Mixed European PMI figures have unsettled investors, while renewed talk of the US Federal Reserve beginning to end its stimulus programme imminently has also put markets on the back foot. A slowdown in the US service sector was a negative for this idea, but there were more positives in the shape of strong ADP jobs data and a surge in house prices. So despite coming off their worst levels, markets ended in negative territory: \u2022 The FTSE 100 fell 22.34 points or 0.34% to 6509.97 \u2022 Germany's Dax dropped 0.92% to 9138.90 \u2022 France's Cac closed down 0.53% at 4150.39 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB lost 0.29% to 18,312.96 \u2022 Spain's Ibex dropped 0.67% to 9540.5 \u2022 In Athens the market ended 0.75% lower at 1211.77 But after an early decline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently virtually unchanged, up just 0.9 points. Meanwhile in Spain, 20,000 people apparently applied for just 400 jobs at Swedish furniture makers Ikea's new store in Valencia. Both the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve publish minutes of their deliberations on interest rates and quantitative easing. Not so the European Central Bank. Or at least not yet. But economists at Barclays think the ECB may announce plans to do just that after its latest meeting tomorrow. Barclays' Philippe Gudin said: We do not expect any monetary policy decision to be announced after the meeting. We think the Refi rate, the deposit rate, and the forward guidance will be kept unchanged. The focus will be on the presentation of staff projections for 2014 and 2015, and in particular on inflation forecasts. We think the governing council will also announce that the ECB is ready to publish the \u201cdeliberations\u201d of the council, or the \u201caccounts of discussions\u201d. At the August press conference, President Draghi announced that \u201cthe executive board will present a proposal to the governing council for discussion during this fall\u201d on communication and the possibility to publish \u201cminutes\u201d of the general council\u2019s meetings, with the view to improving the communication and transparency about the deliberations of the Council and enhance the understanding of the ECB\u2019s reaction function. At both the September and the October meetings, he repeated that the board was still working on it and that a proposal would be put forward. We think that this proposal is likely to be at this week\u2019s agenda and we expect the general council to endorse the board\u2019s proposal for the publication of \u201clight minutes\u201d, which would be consistent with the condition to safeguard the independence of the governors while in the same time improving the transparency of the decision making process. After the potential good news for the UK coalition from Standard &amp; Poor's, there is some worse news on the jobs front. Hewlett Packard has announced plans to cut more than 1,100 UK jobs. My colleague Sean Farrell reports: The computer manufacturer said it would cut 1,124 jobs in the first three months of next year as part of its global plan to combat falling demand and overhaul the company. The Unite union said the jobs were attached to HP's bases in Bracknell in Berkshire, Sheffield and Warrington in Cheshire. HP said it had not spelled out where the cuts would fall. Full story here: Hewlett Packard to cut 1,124 UK jobs More US economic data and more mixed signals. The rate of growth in the service sector slowed in November, with the ISM services index falling from 55.4 in October to 53.9. Analysts were expecting a level of 55, according to Reuters. The sector was still growing however even if more slowly. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: Today's print marks the weakest reading since June and is suggests that the modest recovery in the US economy has not gained much momentum in the fourth quarter. That said, the composite index remains above the 50-neutral level, a sign that activity is still running at a decent pace. We expect fourth quarter GDP to run at around 1.8% quarter on quarter annualized from an upward revised 3.3% in the third quarter (data out tomorrow). As for the labour market, the employment index fell by nearly 4 points to 52.5 in November, suggesting a less dynamic job creation in the services sector versus the prior month. Such an outcome is at odds with today's ADP report that showed an additional 178,000 jobs in the services sector. That said, comments by respondents sound cautiously optimistic and we rule out that the US economy has started a new downward trend. Meanwhile US new single-family homes surged 25.4% in October to 444,000 from September's figure of 354,000. The release of the figures had been delayed by the recent US government shutdown. Markets have regained some ground after the figures. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell back in early trading, is now up around 33 points. In particular the service sector slippage seems to be taken as a positive sign, insofar as it calls into question talk that the US Federal Reserve will begin to taper its stimulus programme before next year. Ahead of the UK autumn statement, some good news for Chancellor George Osborne. Moritz Kraemer, chief sovereign ratings officer at Standard and Poor's, has said that if soon-to-be conducted analysis shows the recent strong UK growth is sustainable, the agency could take rating action. Although Moody's and Fitch cut the UK's rating from AAA, S&amp;P kept the rating but slapped on a negative outlook. This view could now be revised, it appears, and the comments have helped lift the pound. In a webcast Kraemer said S&amp;P had been surprised by the UK growth performance so far this year. He is also quoted as saying it was premature to claim the eurozone crisis was over. Ratings agency Fitch has issued a fairly upbeat report on Spanish banks, saying recent restructuring and integration should start to reap benefits in 2014. It said: The reshaping of the sector is well underway and the bulk of banks have announced material cost reduction programmes, involving the closure of branches and staff lay-offs. These efforts will flow through to lower costs next year, even though there is still work to be done with the completion of a number of outstanding M&amp;A transactions, disposals and further cost rationalisation. Reforms to clean up balance sheets, such as the transfer of real-estate loans of banks that were recapitalised to the state 'bad bank', and efforts to raise loan provisioning and classification standards, should also benefit asset quality. But it warned: However, as a percentage of loans, the weakening of the non-performing loans ratio is likely to be more pronounced if loan books continue to contract. This is probable because, for example, greater affordability after house price falls has been almost entirely offset by the rise in lending rates, higher transaction taxes and the end of fiscal incentives for home purchases. The economy remains weak, despite the earlier-than-expected exit from recession. The segments that pose the greatest risk to further non-performing loans deterioration are households and SMEs, in particular those with only limited access to export markets. Nevertheless, the scrutiny and extensive provisioning exercises of the Spanish banks means they are likely to do relatively well in the ECB's asset quality review and stress tests next year, depending on the criteria applied. We believe further capital building will be needed to offset potentially higher asset quality risks and weak earnings prospects. Higher standards under Basel III would also influence capital needs, as would the possibility of capital shortfalls arising from the ECB's assessments, which cannot be ruled out. The full report is here: Fitch Outlook: Spanish Bank Restructure Benefits to Crystallise Earlier Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras and European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso held a joint press conference after a meeting bptween a Greek government delegation and the EU\u2019s 28-member College of Commissioners in Brussels. (Greece takes over the presidency of the EU from Lithuania in January for six months.) Athens-based newspaper Kathimerini has been tweeting the highlights: The better than expected US jobs data from ADP could suggest that Friday's non-farm payrolls could also be fairly upbeat. This of course just reinforces the views of those who fear the US Federal Reserve might cut back on its $85bn a month bond buying sooner than expected. So we're back in the good news is bad situation once more, hence the current weakness in global stock markets. Adding to that, the US trade deficit narrowed in October with exports hitting a record high. The trade gap fell 5.4% to $40.6bn while September's figure was revised to $43bn from $41.8bn. Back with the jobs figures, Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The US ADP report showed some acceleration in job creation in November. The report is not perfectly aligned with the official BLS labour market statistics. However, today\u2019s data provide further evidence in advance of the crucial release of the payroll data on Friday. The report usually offers reliable information on the direction and strength of private payrolls. That said, the size of the change in private payrolls is not always that much in line with BLS figures. Should the BLS follow the same pattern [as the ADP figures], Friday's data would show a super strong 240,000 increase in private payrolls. We rule out that such an improvement materializes in November as activity remains only on a moderate upward pace and demand is not strong enough to force companies to step up with their hiring plans. We maintain our call for private payrolls at around 190,000 in November. Time for a swift round-up of the key points: Seven banks and one broker have admitted their part in organised attempts to manipulate two important interest rates. RBS, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Citigroup and RP Martin were all fined a total of \u20ac1.71bn for their involvement in manipulating the Euribor or Yen libor, or both. Details here. Barclays and UBS avoided fines, after reporting the cartels to the EC. Three banks - HSBC, Credit Agricole and JP Morgan - and the City broker firm ICAP are being investigated after not settling with the Commission. Competition commissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia called the revelations \"shocking\", and warned that the EC's investigation into possible wrongdoing was not over. Almunia also said the Commission was looking closely at the foreign exchange market, where regulators are also investigating claims that rates were rigged. Highlights of Almunia's press conference start here In other news.... Britain's service sector grew pretty strongly in November, although the rise in activity didn't reach October's 16-year high. The picture was darker in the euro area, with Italy and France's sector shrinking. Germany and Spain reported growth though. Coverage starts here. Royal Mail has averted the risk of strike action with a pay deal. And Tesco has reported a drop in sales in the UK, and across the globe. My colleague Nick Fletcher is taking over. Thanks, as ever, for reading and for your comments. GW Positive economic news from America - a total of 215,000 new private sector jobs were created last month, according to the closely watched ADP jobs survey. That's more than Wall Street analysts had expected (the consensus forecast was for 173,000 new jobs). And in response the dollar is strengthening, US bonds are rising in price, and shares in Europe are falling. Traders are calculating that a strengthening American jobs market puts more pressure on the Federal Reserve to start slowing its bond-buying programme. Here's City editor Jill Treanor on today's record fines: The interest rate rigging scandal was reignited on Wednesday as the European commission levied a record \u20ac1.7bn (\u00a31.4bn) fine on five major banks and a broking firm \u2013 including bailed-out RBS \u2013 for colluding to fix crucial benchmark rates. Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the European competition commissioner, warned that further fines were on the cards as three banks and one broker had refused to settle on other claims being investigated by Brussels. \"This will not be the end of the story,\" said Almunia, who added that foreign exchange markets were also facing an investigation for potential manipulation. Here's Jill's full story: Banks fined record \u20ac1.7bn over benchmark interest rate rigging cartel Speaking of banks, there is some good news at long last for the Irish taxpayer over the Republic's bailed out banking sector. Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald reports: The Bank of Ireland has announced this morning that it has started the process to repay the Irish state the \u20ac1.8 billion it received to rescue it from collapse during the financial crisis. The state is to be repaid \u20ac1.3bn by private investors who will buy its preference shares and the bank will raise \u20ac580m by issuing new shares. Ireland's Finance Minister Michael Noonan said the development would enhance international confidence in the Republic, which is exiting the IMF-EU bail out programme that rescued Ireland from national bankruptcy. But on the jobs front there was worrying news from Co.Kildare today with the announcement that Viagra maker pharmaceutical firm Pfizer is to shed 150 posts at its Newbridge plant. The multi national said it would close its packaging operation there by 2015 but stressed that none of its other sites across the Republic will be effected by the closure. Pfizer employs more than 3,200 people in Ireland. In other stock market news, Royal Mail shares have climbed by 1.2% to 587p after the newly privatised postal operator reached a deal with unions over pay, pensions and conditions. The details of the agreement aren't public yet as they are being considered by the union, and must be voted on. But the breakthrough means there's no danger of a strike over the crucial Christmas period. Good news for anyone who bought shares at 330p in October's privatisation... The news that two important interest rates measures were rigged by some of the biggest players in the market has not caused much alarm in the City...although shares in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (fined \u20ac445m) and Deutsche Bank (\u20ac724m) have fallen. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's share are down1% at lunchtime, while Deutsche Bank are down 0.8%. RBS (\u20ac324m) is shaking off this latest scandal, though, and are up 0.3%. JP Morgan and Citi, the other two banks being fined, will be traded on Wall Street in under 2 hours. There have been enough leaks from Brussels in recent weeks for some of the news to be \"priced in\". The Robin Hood campaign, which wants a transaction tax imposed on the financial market, argues that fines alone won't stop banks breaking the rules. Spokesman Simon Chouffot said: Market-fixing cartels pocketing ill-gotten gains - these banks put your average mobster to shame. The string of scandals shows fines aren't enough to stop banks deceiving markets and ripping off the public - it is time governments took firmer action. We've still to be recompensed for the biggest heist of all - banks precipitated the financial crisis but taxpayers were left to pay for their mistakes. RBS chairman Sir Phillip Hampton has admitted that its systems, controls, and a small number of employees all failed to come up to scratch. Hampton said he and the board \"condemned\" those responsible for RBS's role in both cartels: We acknowledged back in February that there were serious shortcomings in our systems and controls on this issue, but also in the integrity of a very small number of our employees. Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue. The RBS board and new management team condemn the behaviour of the individuals who were involved in these activities. There is no place for it at RBS. RBS is paying \u20ac131m over the Euribor cartel, and \u20ac260m for yen Libor. Around \u00a3320m in sterling terms. That's on top of the \u00a3390m that the bank, bailed out by the taxpayer, was fined by US and UK regulators in February. JP Morgan (fined \u20ac79.9m) says that its role in the Yen Libor cartel relates to the conduct of \"two former traders during a one-month period in early 2007\". It insisted that the actions had not had any impact on its submissions to the Libor panel, and added that it is fighting the EC's claim that it also took part in the Euribor cartel. Here's the JP Morgan statement: The settlement makes no finding that JPMorgan Chase management had any knowledge or involvement in the conduct at issue, or that the traders\u2019 actions had any impact on the firm\u2019s LIBOR submissions or the published LIBOR rates. Separately, the European Commission announced today that it intends to continue its investigation of JPMorgan Chase in connection with Euro-interest-rate derivatives referenced to the EURIBOR benchmark rate. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated fully with the European Commission throughout its investigation and does not believe that the firm engaged in wrongdoing with respect to the EURIBOR benchmark. The company intends to defend itself fully. Blowing the whistle on the yen Libor cartel has saved UBS from a fine of \u20ac2.5bn. Stock broker Dan Davies tweets that someone in the Swiss Bank's compliance department could get the credit.... Barclays has confirmed that avoided a fine by \"voluntarily\" reporting that a cartel was affecting the rate at which banks were officially lending euros to each other. That penalty, according to the EC, would have been \u20ac690m. Barclays said: The European Commission has today announced that it has reached a settlement with Barclays and a number of other banks in relation to anti-competitive conduct concerning Euribor. The settlement acknowledges that the banks\u2019 conduct infringed EC competition law by attempting to distort the normal course of pricing components for interest rate derivatives referencing Euribor. As today\u2019s announcement from the Commission confirms, Barclays voluntarily reported the Euribor conduct to the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission\u2019s investigation. In recognition of this cooperation, Barclays has been granted full immunity from the financial penalties that would otherwise have applied. And that was the end of Joaqu\u00edn Almunia's press conference explaining the fines - highlights start here. The key point, I think, is that this is not the end of the EC's action over this issue. Competition commissioner Almunia said twice that the work is not over -- starting with the proceedings against Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, HSBC, JPMorgan and ICAP. He also explained how these banks broke cartel rules -- conspiring together in a \"shocking\" way to rig these official rates at which they would lend to each other. Alex Barker of the Financial Times asks about the EC's ongoing work into the sector, and cites concerns that foreign exchange traders may have been manipulating the official currency rates. Joaqu\u00edn Almunia reiterates that \"this is not the end of the story\", given the investigations into the firms who declined to settle with the EC. He added that the EC is \"looking very carefully at Forex\", but he cannot say any more today. Is there any details about what the staff at these banks had been up to? Almunia replies that the traders involved were of similar \"quality\" (his quote marks) to those at other firms involved with Libor rigging. I believe that may be a reference to instant messages which showed traders promising each other bottles of champagne or free curries if they helped fix Libor rates. The EC has not released that kind of detail today. Joaqu\u00edn Almunia points out that the Commission's fines over rate-rigging are for running cartels, rather than for market abuse - which is what other regulators have imposed fines for. Asked whether the fines were big enough to deter wrongdoing, Almunia points out that the EC is continuing to investigate three banks (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan) and one broker (ICAP). Almunia says that the recent fine against Google was criticised for being too low, as the point of such penalties is \"not only to punish but to deter\". Many other fines are attacked for being excessive, he added, concluding that in this case \"I think the fines are big ones\"\u2026..\"for the gravity [of the offence], and for the size of their businesses\". Some of the European banks fined today were seen as highly respectable before the crisis, so has your view of image of the sector changed since this investigation started? Joaqu\u00edn Almunia replies that: I am not the only one who, since the beginning of the financial crisis, has changed my view a lot of how financial institutions behave in the market. Not all institutions, but some. The commissioner for competition adds that he is no longer \"a naive believer\" in how financial markets operate as perhaps he once was. I was not much of a believer before, he adds. Speaking in Brussels, EC competition commissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia has told reporters that today's ruling \"is not the end of the story\". Even for the yen case, we have investigations going on against those firms who have not wanted to settle, he said. We have more work to do on the collusion around those two benchmarks, and beyond these benchmarks, Almunia explained, concluding: So we have a lot of work. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan have all declined to settle with the Commission over the investigation into Euribor rate-rigging -- proceedings are now being brought against them. Barclays avoided a fine of \u20ac690m by revealing the existing of the Euribor cartels to antitrust authorities, UBS avoided a fine of \u20ac2.5bn for its work with the EC. Citi avoided being fined an additional \u20ac55m, on top of the \u20ac70m is is being penalised, for co-operating over one of the cartels. The EC's announcement is online here. The EC says is has also opened proceedings against ICAP, the City interbroker firm, in relation to its yen Libor investigation. ICAP, founded by Michael Spencer, the UK businessman, was fined by UK regulators this summer over Libor. Here's the tables showing who's been fined for each offence in this record-breaking case: For Euribor: And here's the breakdown for Yen Libor: The press conference is being streamed live here. Deutsche Bank has received the largest fine, around \u20ac724m, after admitting colluding to rig the yen Libor rate and the Euribor rate (to clarify, this is the rate at which banks would lend to each other in these currencies). RBS also did the double -- being fined a total of \u20ac390m. Another bill for the taxpayer-owned bank to swallow. Barclays, though, has escaped any penalty after being the first to report the Euribor cartel. It is not involved in the yen libor case. Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, Commission Vice-President in charge of competition policy, says he is shocked by what the EC discovered: What is shocking about the LIBOR and EURIBOR scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other. Today's decision sends a clear message that the Commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector. Healthy competition and transparency are crucial for financial markets to work properly, at the service of the real economy rather than the interests of a few. BREAKING: It's official -- the European Commission has imposed fines totalling \u20ac1.71bn for \"participating in cartels in the interest rate derivatives industry\". Eight firms have been fined in total, in two different investigations -- one into interest rate derivatives denominated in Japanese yen, and one into interest rate derivatives denominated in euros. Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have reached a deal over Euribor -- with Barclays escaping a fine because it reported the offences to the Commission. UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin have settled over yen Libor, with UBS receiving no penalty as it blew the whistle in that particular case. Lots more to follow.... Today's fines will come almost 18 months after the rate-rigging scandal first broke into the public consciousness, when Barclays was fined by UK regulators over Libor fixing. Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, measures the price at which banks would lend to each other in various currencies. It measures of the willingness of banks to trust each other, and the rate of return they were agreeing to trade at. Libor was calculated from the figures which various commercial banks reported each day. We can't speculate on what the Commission has found, of course. The various cases settled so far have included evidence that traders conspired between each other to affect their individual contributions to the official Libor rate. This could potentially be profitable if a trader had taken a particular position in the market. Libor was used as the benchmark for many other interest rate products, leading to claims that households and businesses suffered from the 'wrong' Libor rate being used. Reuters' team in Brussels have published a more detailed story on the impending fines for rate-rigging. It confirms that the six banks to be fined today as Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan, Barclays and Societe Generale. As flagged up earlier, HSBC and Credit Agricole are fighting the charges, though, which means they won't get a 10% discount for settling. UBS and Barclays both get immunity having blown the whistle to Brussels. We still expect the press conference to start in around 30 minutes. In the meantime, over to Reuters.... EU Commission to fine banks 1.7 bln euros for benchmark rigging A group of leading European and American banks will be fined a record \u20ac1.7bn (\u00a31.4bn) by the European Commission for the rigging of interest-rate benchmarks, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. The penalty is the biggest yet to be handed down to banks for rigging the benchmarks used to determine the cost of lending, one of the most brazen violations of conduct seen during the financial crisis. The banks to be fined are Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan, Barclays and Societe Generale, sources have said. \"The total fine is \u20ac1.7 billion,\" the person said. If the figure is upheld, it would be the highest antitrust penalty ever imposed by the Commission, the EU's competition regulator. Commission spokesman for competition policy, Antoine Colombani, declined to comment. The benchmarks involved are the London interbank offered rate Libor, the Tokyo interbank offered rate and the euro area equivalents. They are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets ranging from mortgages to derivatives.Unlike the six banks which admitted liability in return for a 10 percent reduction in their fines, Credit Agricole has refused to settle and will likely face sanctions next year. A person familiar with the matter said HSBC has also contested the EU's proposed penalty.Both banks are expected to be formally charged on Wednesday. The EU's competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, will announce the sanctions at a press conference at 1030 GMT. Authorities around the world have so far handed down a total of $3.7 billion in fines to UBS, RBS, Barclays, Rabobank and broker ICAP for manipulating rates, while seven individuals face criminal charges.UBS paid a record fine of $1.5 billion late last year to the U.S. Department of Justice and the UK's Financial Services Authority for rate-rigging. EU fines can reach up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover.UBS blew the whistle on the Libor and Tibor cases and will not be fined as a result. Barclays will escape a fine in the Euribor case because it alerted the Commission to the offence. But before anyone gets carried away with excitement over the strength of the UK economy, check out this feature by my colleague Aditya Chakrabortty: How UK wonder substance graphene can't and won't benefit UK It explains how Britain has failed to take advantage of graphene, a carbon allotrope with exciting properties and huge potential, despite a team at Manchester University winning the Nobel Prize for their ground-breaking research on it. This tweet from Markit shows why it reckons UK growth could be accelerating this month (based on the surveys it has published this week): While we wait for more details of the rate-fixing case, we can flag up that growth in the UK service sector slowed last month, but was still pretty strong. Data firm Markit reports that the UK Services PMI (based on interviews with managers at firms across the UK) came in at 60.0, down from October's 16-year high of 62.5. That still shows \"impressively strong\" expansion, says Markit, (anything over 50 means activity rose). It beats all the major eurozone countries (see here), even though the roaring activity seen in early autumn has eased. Here's some key points: Activity and new business both continue to rise at historically sharp rates Service providers add extra staff to payrolls \uf0a7 Faster rises in prices recorded Factor in strong data from manufacturers and building firms earlier this week, and Marki's data suggests Britain's economy is still expanding at a decent rate, possibly beating the 0.8% growth seen in the third quarter. Good news for George Osborne ahead of tomorrow's Autumn Statement... Reuters is reporting that the EU will announce fines totalling \u20ac1.7bn against a group of the world's largest banks for manipulating the official rates at which financial institutions would lend to each other. We're expecting an announcement from competition commissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia in an hour's time, from 10.30am GMT, but there's nothing official yet (just a polite 'no comment') Here's Reuters' latest story: A group of leading European and American banks will be fined a record \u20ac1.7bn ($2.3 billion) by the European Commission for the rigging of interest-rate benchmarks, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. The banks to be fined are Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan, Barclays and Societe Generale, sources have said. \"The total fine is 1.7 billion euros,\" the person said. If the figure is upheld, it would be the highest antitrust penalty ever imposed by the Commission, the EU's competition regulator. The benchmarks involved are the London interbank offered rate Libor, the Tokyo interbank offered rate and the euro area equivalents. They are used to price hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets ranging from mortgages to derivatives. Scroll back to 7.50am onwards for more details of the investigation. Despite Germany's resurgence, France and Italy's decline last month meant that the overall eurozone private sector grew at a slower rate in November than October. It also suggests that the core countries at the heart of the eurozone are increasingly diverging. Markit's November Eurozone Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), fell slightly to 51.7 from 51.9 in October. On the upside, that was the fifth month of rising activity in a row. But employment in the eurozone private sector fell again, for the 23rd month in the row. Markit's chief economist, Chris Williamson, said: The final PMI data confirm that the euro area\u2019s recovery lost some momentum in November. While we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that the region is growing again, in marked contrast to the decline seen earlier in the year, it\u2019s clearly a concern that the rate of growth remains so fragile. The survey suggests that the region\u2019s economy is on course to grow by just 0.2% in the fourth quarter, providing December sees the PMI hold at its current level, having expanded by just 0.1% in the third quarter. There are some encouraging signs of robust growth in some countries, especially Germany, where the PMI indicates we may see the economy grow by 0.5% in the fourth quarter. A further upturn in the PMI for Spain adds to signs that its economy will have likewise continued to grow. These expansions are largely being driven by manufacturing, in part due to the recent upturn in global trade. However, declines in the PMIs for Italy and France raise the prospect of these countries\u2019 economies contracting again in the fourth quarter, meaning Italy\u2019s recession will have extended into a staggering tenth successive quarter and France will have slid back into a new recession. The full release is here. Germany's service sector expanded last month at the fastest rate in 29 months. It's a stark contrast with the declines in France and Italy, underlining the growing differences between Europe's biggest economies. The German services PMI jumped to 55.4, with firms saying they took on more staff to cope with increased demand. There are new fears over France's economy after activity in its service sector fell last month, according to fresh data from Markit. Like Italy (see 8.49am), the French PMI also came in below the 50-point mark, at just 48.0 in November. That's a decline on October's 50.9, showing activity contracted. French firms surveyed by Markit said that new business, backlogs of work and employment fell last month. Optimism among businesses fell to the lowest level since July. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, commented: A relapse of the French service sector in November underlines the continuing challenges facing companies. Weak demand and confidence again weighed on new business inflows, while jobs were cut at the sharpest rate in seven months. The latest data highlight the risk of a further contraction in GDP during the fourth quarter, which would tip France back into recession. The data indicates that activity across the wider French private sector dropped last month, after growing in October. France's economy is halfway back into recession, having seen GDP shrink by 0.1% in the third quarter (that could be confirmed, or revised, later today) But there's discouraging news for Italy -- its service sector has slipped back into contraction, with the main Services PMI dropping to 47.2, from 50.5 in October. That signals a drop in activity -- the first time that the Italian service sector PMI has dropped below the 50-point in three months. Encouraging news for Spain this morning. Its service sector firms reported that activity picked up last month. Data firm Markit reported that the Spanish PMI (which measures output and employment across the region), rose to 51.5 from 49.6 in October. That's a welcome return to growth, as Spain looks to leave its long recession behind it (50 is the cut-off point between expansion and contraction in Markit's survey) Back on Tesco's results this morning, here's the key chart showing how UK like-for-like sales fell in the last quarter, whether you included fuel or not: The company also warned that Europe remained tough, with a 4% drop in comparable sales (stripping out the effect of new stores). It said: Our like-for-like sales performance for the region as a whole improved slightly from the second quarter, at (4.0)%. In Ireland, our performance continues to reflect extremely challenging conditions for consumers, compounded by a more intense competitive environment. But the key point is that Tesco's like-for-like sales fell in both Europe and Asia, with the company citing \"challenging conditions in many of our markets\". Other supermarkets are coping better, though. Germany's Lidl isn't daunted by the challenge of competing for British shoppers -- it is planning to double its number of UK stores. These latest charges for manipulating interest rate benchmarks come at the end of another year pockmarked by banking scandals. A series of banks have already been fined by UK and US regulators for rigging Libor - including RBS, ICAP and UBS.. As our City editor Jill Treanor explains: The interest rate-rigging scandal that has damaged the reputation of the banking sector looks likely to be reignited as Brussels is expected to impose multimillion-pound fines on a number of major firms for manipulating crucial benchmarks. The fines are the latest to be levied on banks and financial firms for manipulating key benchmark rates. Five firms have already been fined by market regulators on both sides of Atlantic in an ongoing investigation into the manpulation of the rates, used to set interest rates on loans granted around the world. Reuters also reckons that EU competition commissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia could announce the fines as early as 10.30am GMT today... Many major banks are rumoured to be caught up in Brussels' probe, but it's not clear which banks are accused of manipulating which interest rate benchmarks. Adding to the confusion, some are rumoured to have settled while others are fighting the charges. Reuters reported last night that Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland will be hit with multi-million euro fines today. It also appears that UBS will escape a fine, because it alerted authorities to potential wrongdoing in the yen market. UBS has already been penalised $1.5bn by US authorities over separate Libor manipulation by some of its traders. Societe Generale is said to be also facing charges of Euribor rigging. HSBC and Credit Agricole, though, are reported to be fighting the EU over the allegations. And Barclays, Reuters reckons, will escape any Euribor penalties after blowing the whistle to Brussels. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. The banking sector is preparing face the music, again, over the global interest rate rigging scandal. The European Union is putting the finishing touches to big fines and charges involving as many as 10 leading financial institutions. Each company is accused of conspiring to fix the rates at which banks would lend to each other, either in euros (the Euribor rate) or yen (yen Libor, priced in London), or both. Brussels has also been probing the Tokyo rate known as Tibor. With the FT reckoning that banks could be fined a total of \u20ac800m for Euribor rigging, and again for yen, the total could break the previous record for anti-trust penalties of \u20ac1.5bn. Rumours from Brussels are that not every bank has reached a deal with the EU -- so we're likely to see a mixture of settlements and formal charges. An announcement from Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, EU competition commissioner, is expected this morning, although all sides have been keeping quiet on the precise timing.... More details to follow... UK supermarket chain Tesco is also in the spotlight this morning after reporting a drop in underlying sales in the UK. Like-for like sales in the UK fell 1.5% (stripping out VAT and petrol), showing that Tesco has not managed to reverse its slide. Chief executive Philip Clarke blamed cash-squeezed households, saying: Continuing pressures on UK household finances have made the grocery market more challenging for everyone since the summer and our third quarter performance reflects this. But it's not just the UK where Tesco is struggling -- sales were down in markets across the globe. Details and reaction to follow.... Also coming up today... we get the latest service sector data for countries across the globe. In the UK, the data (at 9.30am GMT) is expected to show another strong rise in activity last month, while France's service sector will probably report a small decline. We'll be tracking the action through the day....",

The company is aiming to convert three of its six generating plants to produce energy from biomass rather than coal, and the government confirmed a strike price of \u00a3105 per megawatt hour from 2015 for biomass generation. This is in line with a provisional announcement, but there had been some suggestions it could be scaled back. Exane BNP Paribas analyst Iain Turner told Reuters:</p> <blockquote> There were a few voices in the market saying that they're not going to get what the draft price was, and I think it's just a relief rally that they have got what they are supposed to get. <br> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Sage</strong> soared 25.5p to 372.9p after the accounting software specialist reported a 1% rise in profits to \u00a3360.5m before a \u00a3188m exceptional charge relating to disposals. It also raised its dividend by 6%.</p> <p>Analysts had been concerned about growing competition for Sage, particularly in the area of cloud computing.

Mixed signals from the US - better than expected jobs figures, strong home sales but a slowdown in service sector growth - saw shares vacillate during the day before recovering from their worst levels.

      "bodyText": "In an uncertain market there were a number of eye catching price movements. Drax, the power station owner, surged 59p or nearly 9% to 743p after the UK government set its subsidy prices for renewable energy projects. The company is aiming to convert three of its six generating plants to produce energy from biomass rather than coal, and the government confirmed a strike price of \u00a3105 per megawatt hour from 2015 for biomass generation. This is in line with a provisional announcement, but there had been some suggestions it could be scaled back. Exane BNP Paribas analyst Iain Turner told Reuters: There were a few voices in the market saying that they're not going to get what the draft price was, and I think it's just a relief rally that they have got what they are supposed to get. Meanwhile Sage soared 25.5p to 372.9p after the accounting software specialist reported a 1% rise in profits to \u00a3360.5m before a \u00a3188m exceptional charge relating to disposals. It also raised its dividend by 6%. Analysts had been concerned about growing competition for Sage, particularly in the area of cloud computing. But chief executive Guy Berruyer was upbeat about the prospects, highlighting its success with small and medium sized businesses: We remain confident of achieving our target of 6% organic revenue growth in 2015 and anticipate further progress during the year ahead. But Standard Chartered slumped 92.5p to 1338.5p after the Asia-focused bank warned profits would be flat on 2013, after difficult market conditions in the second half of the year. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 22.46 points lower at 6509.97 ahead of Thursday's Bank of England and European Central Bank meetings, the UK autumn statement and Friday's US non-farm payrolls. Investors continue to be nervous about the US Federal Reserve being to ease back on its $85bn a month bond buying programme, a key support for global markets in recent months. Mixed signals from the US - better than expected jobs figures, strong home sales but a slowdown in service sector growth - saw shares vacillate during the day before recovering from their worst levels. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Today's European session has been another disappointment as expectations of a December Santa Rally appear stuck in a snow drift, while this afternoon's surprisingly positive US ADP numbers appeared to increase the odds of a Fed move in December, though a disappointing US services ISM report tempered the effects of the sell-off.

      "bodyText": "The number of mobile network operators in Britain could soon drop from four to three, according to the chief executive of the UK's smallest carrier. Three, which has 7.8 million customers and 10% of the market, has previously opposed consolidation in the UK, arguing that prices would rise and consumers would suffer. \"Under the right circumstances the UK could operate competitively with three or with five,\" said Three chief executive David Dyson, predicting a round of consolidation in Europe from 2014. Any mergers would have to ensure balance in the market, leaving a trio of strong players at the end of the process, he added. Dyson was responding to speculation that Three, which is owned by the wealthy Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, could look to buy O2 in Britain, as it is currently seeking to do in Ireland. With outsiders such as America's AT&amp;T looking to enter the European market, bankers are predicting a wave of mega-mergers and acquisitions starting next year. Dyson said mobile operators across Europe were being pushed towards mergers as they suffer \"death by 1000 cuts\". Companies face the double pressure of falling revenues and rising costs. Just as they prepare to ramp up investment to roll out new 4G mobile internet services, their revenues are being slashed. Income from voice calls and text messages is falling as customers switch mobile communication to internet-based platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook. Regulators have also forced operators to reduce the inflated cost of using a phone abroad, and are looking to cap the amount customers are liable for on large bills run up on lost or stolen phones. Much hinges on what regulators decide in Germany in the coming months. Telefonica's O2 brand has applied for permission to merge with E-Plus, reducing the number of network owners in Germany from four to three. \"Let's see what happens in Germany first,\" said Dyson. \"We are three years into a five-year plan to double our customer base from five million to 10 million. If we can deliver on that plan maybe that makes us more interesting as a target or puts us in a position where we can do something as an acquirer.\" Three opposed the 2010 merger of T-Mobile and Orange, which reduced competition from five to four players in Britain, and has sided with the telecoms watchdog Ofcom in arguing for a minimum of four competitors. During the last spectrum auction, Three secured special protection from Ofcom to ensure it was not outbid and could continue to challenge the big three \u2013 EE, O2 and Vodafone. Research consultancy CCS Insight has forecast a merger between Three and O2 in its predictions for 2014. This would establish Three as as a leading European operator and follows recent deals struck in Ireland and Austria, said CCS, adding: \"Telefonica, O2's parent, is looking to reduce debt and may be keen to sell in a market with favourable regulatory conditions.\" Dyson was speaking as Three added the United States, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Macau to the list of countries where customers will pay the same for using their phone abroad as they do at home.",

At Tesco just off the Old Kent Road, it's the small things that are not quite right: the half dozen empty crates in the vegetable aisle nearly four hours after opening, the torn advent calendar left on the shelf, a box of festive fruit and nuts displayed upside down, contents spilling out of their neat rows. \"That makes you not want to buy it,\" says retail expert Andy Stevens of Verdict. \"It is the sort of thing they shouldn't be slipping up on.\" Tesco, still the UK's largest supermarket with 30% market share, has been slipping up a lot. Almost two years since the supermarket giant issued its first profits warning in a generation, it has published another set of horrible results. UK like-for-like sales are down 1.5%, with further falls across all its major foreign markets. The scale of the task facing Tesco is clear on the Old Kent Road, a busy south London highway lined with big brand stores and local discounters. In one direction is Asda, the UK's No 2 supermarket on some measures, offering \u2013 on this street at least \u2013 a bigger, brighter store with a halal butcher Tesco doesn't have. In the other direction is discount chain Lidl, selling basics at rock-bottom prices, as well as cut-price luxuries such as frozen lobsters and champagne at \u00a312 a bottle. Stuck in the middle is Tesco. \"The problem is that it is trying to be everything for everyone,\" says Stevens. \"But there is someone in each tier who is doing it better.\" Being \"a jack of all trades and master of none\" is especially troublesome outside the core grocery business \u2013 Stevens gives this store three out of 10 for its non-food offer. \"A lot of it is just completely wasted space,\" he says, referring to the eclectic mix of TVs, sports energy bars and white paint. \"I don't understand why anyone would come here for [paint] when there is a B&amp;Q or a Homebase next door.\" Clothing remains a strong point, he says, taking in the novelty Christmas jumpers. The problem, he thinks, is that not enough customers will browse this separate corner of the store. The store gets higher marks for food \u2013 six out of 10. \"You can tell they have made an effort,\" he says, pointing to the wooden panelling and cheery bunting on the alcoholic drinks aisle. But Tesco could still do better: the takeaway sandwiches look \"uninspired\", while not enough is being done to promote its revamped \"Finest\" range. \"There is no real promotion. You would think the buildup to Christmas is the right time to push it.\" These luxuries are becoming a key battleground. Up the road, Lidl are offering award-winning wines and chests full of British steak mince, partridge and free-range chickens. Stevens does not think many people are in the market for Lidl's \u00a340 leg of Serrano ham. \"It is more about telling people you can come into Lidl and you can get these luxury products. It gets people in \u2026 and then they see they can buy bread for 47p,\" he says. \"Throughout the downturn a lot of people have come to Aldi and Lidl for the first time and they'll stick to it.\" Facing this existential challenge, Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke wants to make Tesco into something more than a place to do the weekly shop. Tesco's flagship store in Watford offers a Harris &amp; Hoole coffee shop, a Giraffe restaurant and a community space that can be used for yoga and baby gym. \"The real challenge is how they rejig Watford to make that model work across the whole portfolio,\" says Stevens.",

    "webTitle": "Tesco sales fall across all major markets", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The scale of the task facing Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke was underlined on Wednesday as the UK's biggest grocer revealed fresh declines in every country where it operates. Like-for-like sales in the UK \u2013 which exclude gains from new shopfloor space \u2013 fell by 1.5% in the third quarter, excluding new stores and petrol, with Tesco blaming \"an unprecedented period of declining incomes\" and a \"challenging grocery market\". The dip in sales represents a deepening of Tesco's woes, following a period of stagnant UK growth. They are a further decline on the 0.7% fall recorded over the same period last year. Retail analyst Dave McCarthy at HSBC said: \"There was no good news in the statement, only confirmation that things are as bad as expected and worse in some instances.\" John Ibbotson of consultants Retail Vision said Clarke's job was now under threat, arguing that Tesco was not changing fast enough to respond to the shakeup in the grocery market. In the UK, which generates 70% of Tesco profits, the grocer is losing market share at the premium and discount ends of the market, to rivals like Aldi and Waitrose. Shoppers are also making more non-food purchases on the internet and replacing the big weekly shop with online delivery and convenience store shopping \u2013 leaving Tesco with too many big stores. Tesco fared even worse in its major foreign markets: sales in continental Europe were down 4%, with the steepest fall in Ireland, where sales plummeted by 8.1%. The fall in Slovakia was 5.7% and 4.9% in the Czech Republic, but the pace of decline slackened in Poland with a 0.7% fall, and Turkey was down 3.5%. In Asia like-for-like sales were down 5.1%, with Thailand the worst performer, down 6.9%, followed by South Korea, down 4.8%. Clarke, who has embarked on a \u00a31bn turnaround plan since taking the top job in 2011, said customers were already seeing improvements that would pay off for the company in the long run: \"We are in the middle of that business transformation plan, we are in the middle of a retail revolution and we are in the middle of the toughest retail market in a generation. It makes for some difficult quarterly reporting but we are already getting better for customers every day.\" Facing calls to copy the discounters by slashing prices, Clarke said he would not \"trade long-term health for short-term help\", adding that price was only one factor. \"We are absolutely determined to make sure that price, quality, range and service improve for customers everywhere.\" With the poor UK performance widely expected in the City, Tesco shares rose in early trading, but slipped 0.2% later to 340 pence. Investors were relieved there was no alarm bell on profits \u2013 Tesco noted it was \"performing in line with market expectations for the full year\" \u2013 but its 5.2% profit margin has been described by HSBC as unsustainable. Clark denied that Tesco was squeezing suppliers to hold up its profits. Other City analysts called on investors to have patience with the supermarket giant, which is attempting to win back customers by giving stores broader appeal, with the introduction of Harris &amp; Hoole coffee shops and family-friendly Giraffe restaurants. Tesco said it had \"refreshed\" more than 100 stores during its third quarter and claimed it had tailored 1,600 Express stores to local needs. But with more than 3,000 shops across its estate \u2013 including 1,000 superstores \u2013 Clarke said the overhaul would take time: \"We do plan to go quicker but you can only go as quick as you can go.\" As the bricks-and mortar revamp takes shape, Clarke is trying to sharpen up Tesco's internet presence by expanding click-and-collect services. The grocer also revealed that it has sold 300,000 of its Hudl tablet computers and expects to double that over Christmas. But Ibbotson said the decline in sales called Clarke's turnaround plan into question. \"Another very poor set of results from the UK's largest grocer \u2026 This, together with declining sales in key overseas markets, will put Clarke and his senior management team under threat. Everything now depends on the critical Christmas period, but schmaltzy advertising, sponsorship of Downton Abbey and promising jam tomorrow are no guarantees that things will turn around.\" The rise of the discounters meant that Tesco's attempt to blame its weaker grocery performance on \"the effects of an unprecedented period of declining real incomes\" and the \"higher cost of living\" was met with scepticism. Aldi and Lidl continue to increase their market share, according to the latest data from Kantar, by broadening their range into discounted luxuries such as fine wine and partridge. Aldi recently outlined plans to double its store numbers. But Bryan Roberts, Kantar Retail's director of retail insights, warned against the \"nuclear\" option of slashing prices. \"The recent past shows us that value is so much more than price,\" he said, advising Tesco to concentrate on improving its stores and customer service. Phil Dorrell at Retail Remedy described the results as \"a like-for-like whitewash\", but said Tesco could still turn things around. \"The re-emergence of Tesco won't happen overnight and some shareholders will lose patience with what is likely to be another year of mediocre results. Shareholders with a sense of perspective, though, will cut Tesco some slack. The long-term value and returns Philip Clarke talks about will come but it will take time.\"",

      "body": "<p>The scale of the task facing Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke was underlined on Wednesday as the UK's biggest grocer revealed fresh declines in every country where it operates.</p> <p>Like-for-like sales in the UK \u2013 which exclude gains from new shopfloor space \u2013 fell by 1.5% in the third quarter, excluding new stores and petrol, with Tesco blaming \"an unprecedented period of declining incomes\" and a \"challenging grocery market\".</p> <p>The dip in sales represents a deepening of Tesco's woes, following a period of stagnant UK growth. They are a further decline on the 0.7% fall recorded over the same period last year.</p> <p>Retail analyst Dave McCarthy at HSBC said: \"There was no good news in the statement, only confirmation that things are as bad as expected and worse in some instances.\"</p> <p>John Ibbotson of consultants Retail Vision said Clarke's job was now under threat, arguing that Tesco was not changing fast enough to respond to the shakeup in the grocery market. In the UK, which generates 70% of Tesco profits, the grocer is losing market share at the premium and discount ends of the market, to rivals like Aldi and Waitrose. Shoppers are also making more non-food purchases on the internet and replacing the big weekly shop with online delivery and convenience store shopping \u2013 leaving Tesco with too many big stores.</p> <p>Tesco fared even worse in its major foreign markets: sales in continental Europe were down 4%, with the steepest fall in Ireland, where sales plummeted by 8.1%. The fall in Slovakia was 5.7% and 4.9% in the Czech Republic, but the pace of decline slackened in Poland with a 0.7% fall, and Turkey was down 3.5%.</p> <p>In Asia like-for-like sales were down 5.1%, with Thailand the worst performer, down 6.9%, followed by South Korea, down 4.8%.</p> <p>Clarke, who has embarked on a \u00a31bn turnaround plan since taking the top job in 2011, said customers were already seeing improvements that would pay off for the company in the long run: \"We are in the middle of that business transformation plan, we are in the middle of a retail revolution and we are in the middle of the toughest retail market in a generation. It makes for some difficult quarterly reporting but we are already getting better for customers every day.\"</p> <p>Facing calls to copy the discounters by slashing prices, Clarke said he would not \"trade long-term health for short-term help\", adding that price was only one factor. \"We are absolutely determined to make sure that price, quality, range and service improve for customers everywhere.\"</p> <p>With the poor UK performance widely expected in the City, Tesco shares rose in early trading, but slipped 0.2% later to 340 pence. Investors were relieved there was no alarm bell on profits \u2013 Tesco noted it was \"performing in line with market expectations for the full year\" \u2013 but its 5.2% profit margin has been described by HSBC as unsustainable. Clark denied that Tesco was <a href=\"http://http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/28/tesco-accused-of-squeezing-suppliers\" title=\"\">squeezing suppliers to hold up its profits</a>.</p> <p>Other City analysts called on investors to have patience with the supermarket giant, which is attempting to win back customers by giving stores broader appeal, with the introduction of Harris &amp; Hoole coffee shops and family-friendly Giraffe restaurants. Tesco said it had \"refreshed\" more than 100 stores during its third quarter and claimed it had tailored 1,600 Express stores to local needs. But with more than 3,000 shops across its estate \u2013 including 1,000 superstores \u2013 Clarke said the overhaul would take time: \"We do plan to go quicker but you can only go as quick as you can go.\"</p> <p>As the bricks-and mortar revamp takes shape, Clarke is trying to sharpen up Tesco's internet presence by expanding click-and-collect services. The grocer also revealed that it has sold 300,000 of its Hudl tablet computers and expects to double that over Christmas.</p> <p>But Ibbotson said the decline in sales called Clarke's turnaround plan into question. \"Another very poor set of results from the UK's largest grocer \u2026 This, together with declining sales in key overseas markets, will put Clarke and his senior management team under threat. Everything now depends on the critical Christmas period, but schmaltzy advertising, sponsorship of Downton Abbey and promising jam tomorrow are no guarantees that things will turn around.\"</p> <p>The rise of the discounters meant that Tesco's attempt to blame its weaker grocery performance on \"the effects of an unprecedented period of declining real incomes\" and the \"higher cost of living\" was met with scepticism. Aldi and Lidl continue to increase their market share, according to the latest data from Kantar, by broadening their range into discounted luxuries such as fine wine and partridge. Aldi recently outlined plans to double its store numbers.</p> <p>But Bryan Roberts, Kantar Retail's director of retail insights, warned against the \"nuclear\" option of slashing prices. \"The recent past shows us that value is so much more than price,\" he said, advising Tesco to concentrate on improving its stores and customer service.</p> <p>Phil Dorrell at Retail Remedy described the results as \"a like-for-like whitewash\", but said Tesco could still turn things around. \"The re-emergence of Tesco won't happen overnight and some shareholders will lose patience with what is likely to be another year of mediocre results.

      "bodyText": "Hewlett Packard (HP) has announced plans to cut more than 1,100 UK jobs at the start of next year. The computer manufacturer said it would cut 1,124 jobs in the first three months of next year as part of its global plan to combat falling demand and overhaul the company. The Unite union said the jobs were attached to HP's bases in Bracknell in Berkshire, Sheffield and Warrington in Cheshire. HP said it had not spelled out where the cuts would fall. Unite said workers were told about the cuts on Wednesday and that a union representative would attend a meeting in Bracknell where the plans would be outlined. The union's national officer Ian Tonks said: \"For the last five years HP has been addicted to a culture of job cuts in the UK to such an extent that its highly skilled workforce has little faith in the way the company is being managed and will be going forward. Unite will be doing everything possible to mitigate these job losses which are a hammer blow to the UK's IT sector and very distressing for employees in the run-up to Christmas.\" The union said it expected 618 jobs to go at its Bracknell hub, where employees work at multiple locations. A further 483 jobs will be cut at Warrington and 23 at Sheffield, the union said. Unite said many of those facing redundancy either work from home or have been contracted out to companies. In a statement, HP said: \"The proposed UK workforce management plan is part of HP's global multi-year productivity initiative that was announced on 23 May 2012, and updated at its securities analysts meeting on 9 October 2013, to address current market and business pressures in support of HP's turnaround in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\" HP's share price has almost doubled over the last year as investors have warmed to new boss Meg Whitman's efforts to overhaul the company - even as sales of computers have fallen. But her plan has been at the expense of HP's workforce as Whitman has cut thousands of jobs at the computer giant's operations around the world. Personal computer sales have fallen in each of the past six quarters, hitting HP's traditional business as consumers opt for tablets and smartphones. This year will see the biggest ever drop in shipments of PCs with demand continuing to fall into 2014, according to research firm International Data Corporation. Unite said HP's European operations had little autonomy and that job cuts were driven by its head office in the US. HP said it would help workers find other jobs within the company and give them help to find other jobs if they needed it. The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has announced 150 job losses at its plant in Newbridge, County Kildare, Ireland. The factory employs 700 workers out of about 3,200 employed in Ireland by the US drugs company.",

      "bodyText": "Christmas may be the season for a festive spending spree, but Britain's cash-conscious households have restrained their annual festive blowout in the face of recession and austerity, according to a new analysis by the Office for National Statistics. As retailers pin their hopes on a last-minute surge in spending over the next couple of weeks, the ONS revealed that in real terms, Christmas spending in the average household was no higher last year than in 2006. \"Household expenditure in volume terms during Q4 2012 was at broadly the same level as in Q4 2006, reflecting changing household circumstances, including the relatively weak growth of real households' disposable income over this period,\" the ONS said in its latest economic review. Wages have consistently grown more slowly than prices over recent years, and resorting to a more frugal Christmas is one way households have managed to make ends meet. Consumers tend to ramp up spending in the final three months of the year, as they head out to Christmas parties and gear up for a frenzy of present-giving and culinary overindulgence. On average, between 1997 and 2012, the ONS says, there was a 6.7% \"festive premium\" in households' spending in the final quarter over the average for the first and third quarters of the year (leaving out the summer months, when holidays tend to distort the pattern). In 2008, as the economy plunged into recession, that festive premium fell to just 2.9% as shoppers scrimped and saved on festivities; and it has been lower than average ever since. Since the financial crisis, \"households have spent less during the final three months of the year as a proportion of their annual total, possibly in response to constrained economic circumstances and greater uncertainty about the economic outlook\", the ONS says. Spending priorities have also shifted over the years, as tastes have changed. The average person spent \u00a370 on meat during the final quarter of 1997, for example; that had risen sharply to \u00a379, adjusted for inflation, by 2007, but fell back again, to \u00a369, by last Christmas. Spending on wine per head also rose sharply in real terms, from \u00a322 in 1997 to \u00a335 a decade later, as Britain acquired a new-found fondness for the grape; but it had fallen back to \u00a331 by 2012. Meanwhile, consumption of beer was back at 2001 levels. Even the average consumer's budget for sweets was pared back in the wake of the crisis, from \u00a347 in 2007 to \u00a342 by 2012. The ONS also analyses some of the trends in Christmas presents. Spending on games has shot up, despite the tough economic times, rising by an average of 11.5% a year in real terms to \u00a392 in 2012 as electronic gaming has shot up in popularity, with the release of major new games now as big an event as a movie premiere. There has also been a sharp rise in spending on \"photographic and optical equipment\", which shows an average real-terms increase of almost 19%.",

    "webTitle": "Banks fined record \u20ac1.7bn over benchmark interest rate rigging cartel", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The already battered reputation of banks took an expensive new hit yesterday when the European commission slapped a record \u20ac1.7bn (\u00a31.4bn) fine on six firms \u2013 including the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 for colluding to fix key interest rate benchmarks. Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the European competition commissioner, warned that further fines were on the cards as three more banks, including HSBC, and one broker have refused to settle the long-running investigation by Brussels. He revealed that the authorities were in the process of unmasking a fresh scandal in the currency markets that could further damage the industry and add to the vast sums banks have had to pay for their mistakes since the financial meltdown. \"This will not be the end of the story, neither for interest-rate derivatives nor for the manipulation of benchmarks,\" Almunia said. \"One of the areas where we have received information that we are looking at very, very carefully is forex [foreign exchange].\" The latest fines \u2013 the first levied on a financial cartel by Europe since the banking crisis began \u2013 take the total penalties for rigging Libor and other key interest-rate benchmarks to \u00a33.5bn. Research by the London School of Economics (LSE) to be published next week will put a total of \u00a3100bn on the costs of misconduct for 10 major banks, including RBS, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group, in the five years to the end of 2012. That total has now risen by \u00a330bn, according to an analysis for the Guardian by MSCI ESG Research. Roger McCormick, the LSE professor who led the research team, said: \"To put that into context, the one year's budget of the 24 richest nations for international aid is \u00a380bn, and the national health service budget is \u00a3100bn to \u00a3110bn every year.\" Yesterday's announcement saw two US banks, Citigroup and JP Morgan, receive their first fines over the interest-rate rigging scandal, while the other banks received fresh penalties on top of those already imposed by regulators. Barclays, the first bank penalised for rigging Libor when it was fined \u00a3290m in June last year, was also part of the Euribor cartel, the European equivalent of Libor. However, this time the UK bank blew the whistle. In return for that help Barclays was let off another \u00a3570m fine. Similarly, the Swiss bank UBS escaped a \u00a32.1bn fine by telling regulators about the cartel that had been rigging yen Libor. It had already paid \u00a3940m in fines related to manipulating the London Libor rate. Almunia said: \"What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.\" The biggest fine \u2013 \u00a3600m \u2013 was on Deutsche Bank, putting pressure on the Treasury minister Sajid Javid, who was previously head of global credit trading for Asia and had seat on the board of Deutsche's international operations division until he left in 2009. Javid said last night that while at the German bank he was not responsible for the departments hit by the fine and as a minister he had not held any talks with Brussels or any of the firms involved. The commission also inflicted more pain on RBS, which has suspended four traders and will now pay another \u00a3320m on top of \u00a3390m already handed over to US and UK regulators. The new fine adds to its public image problems following a systems meltdown this week and recent allegations, which it denies, that it has abused its small business customers. Its chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, said: \"Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue. The RBS board and new management team condemn the behaviour of the individuals who were involved in these activities.\" The Euribor investigation focused on the period between September 2005 and May 2008 and the settlement involved Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. In yen Libor, the banks involved were UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and JP Morgan. The broker RP Martin was also involved, and fined for using its contacts with banks involved in settling Libor. Other banks yet to agree fines for fixing Euribor rates \u2013 apart from HSBC \u2013 are Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and JP Morgan. The money broker Icap, run by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, is still facing penalties for rigging yen Libor. Almunia said: \"Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector.\" Matt Moscardi, senior analyst at MSCI ESG Research, questioned whether the penalties were as hefty as they first appeared. \"If you look at RBS it is the equivalent to its revenues for five weeks. That's not much. If you think about the manipulation of a global interest rate where several trillion dollars are priced to it, you'd think they'd be more punitive.\"",

It had already paid \u00a3940m in fines related to manipulating the London Libor rate.</p> <p>Almunia said: \"What is shocking about the Libor and Euribor scandals is not only the manipulation of benchmarks, which is being tackled by financial regulators worldwide, but also the collusion between banks who are supposed to be competing with each other.\" </p> <p>The biggest fine \u2013 \u00a3600m \u2013 was on Deutsche Bank, putting pressure on the Treasury minister Sajid Javid, who was previously head of global credit trading for Asia and had seat on the board of Deutsche's international operations division until he left in 2009. </p> <p>Javid said last night that while at the German bank he was not responsible for the departments hit by the fine and as a minister he had not held any talks with Brussels or any of the firms involved.</p> <p>The commission also inflicted more pain on RBS, which has suspended four traders and will now pay another \u00a3320m on top of \u00a3390m already handed over to US and UK regulators. The new fine adds to its public image problems following a systems meltdown this week and recent allegations, which it denies, that it has abused its small business customers.</p> <p>Its chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, said: \"Today is another sobering reminder of those past failings and nobody should be in any doubt about how seriously we have taken this issue. The RBS board and new management team condemn the behaviour of the individuals who were involved in these activities.\"</p> <p>The Euribor investigation focused on the period between September 2005 and May 2008 and the settlement involved Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. In yen Libor, the banks involved were UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and JP Morgan. The broker RP Martin was also involved, and fined for using its contacts with banks involved in settling Libor.</p> <p>Other banks yet to agree fines for fixing Euribor rates \u2013 apart from HSBC \u2013 are Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and JP Morgan. The money broker Icap, run by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, is still facing penalties for rigging yen Libor.</p> <p>Almunia said: \"Today's decision sends a clear message that the commission is determined to fight and sanction these cartels in the financial sector.\"</p> <p>Matt Moscardi, senior analyst at MSCI ESG Research, questioned whether the penalties were as hefty as they first appeared. \"If you look at RBS it is the equivalent to its revenues for five weeks. That's not much. If you think about the manipulation of a global interest rate where several trillion dollars are priced to it, you'd think they'd be more punitive.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Toyota Australia faces a last-minute legal challenge from within its own workforce, which seeks to block a management plan to boost productivity and cut costs at its Melbourne assembly plant \u2013 adding to doubts over the future of local automotive manufacturing. The car maker says it needs to cut the cost of each locally produced car by $3800 in coming years to compete with Toyota plants in other countries and to win head approval to build a new model Camry and continue exporting to the Middle East. But a small group of Toyota shop stewards and employees have asked the federal court to stop management putting the changes to a vote of the workforce on 13 December, arguing that they cannot make new claims while an existing workplace agreement is in place. In reply, lawyers for Toyota have argued that the company can seek employee approval to vary the existing agreement, as occurred when Holden threatened to shut its assembly plant in AdeIaide unless workers agreed to an overhaul of its workplace practices. But the legal action has seen the date for the workplace ballot pushed back from 6 December to 13 December. The federal court is expected to deliver its judgment in the Toyota case next week, days before the workforce votes on the changes. In the meantime, the car maker has said it will continue to communicate directly with the 2500 workers at its plant at Altona in Melbourne's western suburbs. \"We're doing everything we can to secure the future for our employees and their families,\" said Toyota spokeswoman Beck Angel. \"The proposed changes are designed to remove outdated and uncompetitive practices and allowances that make it difficult to compete with other Toyota plants.\" The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union is not directly taking the legal action, but the national secretary of its vehicle building division, Dave Smith, said car industry unions had better relations with Holden\u2019s management than with Toyota\u2019s. Smith said unions were prepared to negotiate with Toyota on the need to change work practices, which would then be put to the workforce for approval. \"People need to address these issues in a joint manner and not just say 'this is what you will have to cop'. \"We're not closing the door on them [Toyota management]. That's the last thing we want,\" he said. The Holden package was supported by workers after the car maker agreed to give an outside manufacturing expert access to its internal financial information to test management claims about the need for change. The Holden workers grudgingly agreed to a three-year wage freeze, but this was contingent on the company approving $1 billion in new investment by a set date. That decision has not yet been made and the car maker had to proceed with a 3% pay rise for this year.
