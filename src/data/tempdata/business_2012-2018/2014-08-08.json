      "bodyText": "A British private investigator has been sentenced to two and a half years in jail by a Chinese court after becoming embroiled in a sex and whistleblowing scandal at the drug firm GlaxoSmithKline. Peter Humphrey, 58, was also fined 200,000 yuan (\u00a319,300), and his wife, Yu Yingzeng \u2013 a naturalised American citizen \u2013 was sentenced to two years and fined 150,000 yuan in the first case of its kind involving foreigners in China. Humphrey will be deported at the end of his sentence. GSK was not mentioned during proceedings that shed rare light on the operation of corporate sleuths in the world's second largest economy, but the firm is at the centre of a complex web of allegations. Humphrey and his wife have been detained since July last year on suspicion of using illegal means to collect data. GSK had hired them to investigate why the company's then head of China operations, Mark Reilly, had been filmed surreptitiously having sex with his Chinese girlfriend in his guarded luxury home. \"I am very sad about the court's verdict, but I hope the authorities will take into account their poor health conditions,\" Harvey Humphrey, the couple's 19-year-old son, said in a statement after the court's announcement.

    "webTitle": "And now for a vote on the actual Co-op reforms", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If you thought the Co-operative Group had already voted to adopt Lord Myners' ideas on how the organisation should be governed, think again. That 100% vote in favour in May was merely on the principles behind the Myners proposals. Now here come the actual proposals and, after a spin in the Co-op washer, some of the colours have faded. Here, for example, is what Myners said about the importance of keeping unqualified lay directors (patron pastor: Paul Flowers) off the main board: \"To insist on at least a token presence is akin to insisting that Manchester United should field a side which included at least three players from Rochdale FC.\" So what's this in the Co-op's final proposals? Three individuals on a slimmed-down main board of nine people will be \"member-nominated directors\". Don't worry, argues Co-op chair Ursula Lidbetter, a high bar will apply to ability and experience; the nominations committee will have teeth, employ headhunters and search widely. In other words, a Flowers-style applicant wouldn't get a look-in because he or she would fail to meet \"the high standards of competence commensurate with the needs of a business of the scale and complexity of the Group\". As long as that turns out to be the case, no harm may come of diluting Myners' purer vision. The risk, of course, is that expectations are managed downwards over time and the height of the bar comes to be set by the stature of the applicants. As Myners notes dryly, the commitment to setting the bar high would be greater if the lay directors who sat on the board \"over the last five disastrous years\" made it clear they won't stand for election. He's right. Once those failed directors have resigned, they should stay resigned. In other respects, the proposals for the new setup look sensible, and roughly as originally advertised. Of course, the arrangements are less than straightforward, but that's the Co-op: it's not a plc. There will be a council of up to 100 members to guard the organisation's soul and values and hold the board to account. This will have a president and, blimey, there will also be 10-15 \"senators\". Nice job title, but something less grand might suit Co-op's current station. In case anyone has forgotten amid the governance debate, the Co-op still has a very large pile of debt that needs to be paid down. Still, the final proposals on governance are a vast improvement on the old regime. The top brass should obviously vote in favour. The alternative is oblivion. Tesco reality check Tesco's shares, bizarrely, rose 1% on the day last month that the group issued a profits warning and dispatched chief executive Phil Clarke. The onvestors' hopeful thought was that incoming boss Dave Lewis would import some Unilever-style vigour and growth and all would be well with the minimum amount of pain. Since then, there's been a serious rethink. The shares have slipped 15% to 247p. That still leaves 20% to go, if HSBC analyst David McCarthy is right. He put a 195p \"target price\" on Tesco this week and explained why over 25 pages. Short version: in order to get Tesco moving forward again, Lewis needs at the outset to accept lower profits and dividends, by half on all fronts. It is a radical diagnosis, but McCarthy has been gloomy and correct about Tesco for ages and his argument is persuasive. A \"rebasing\" of profits and dividends is the traditional way for new management to tell shareholders that the business is in even worse shape than they thought. Tesco's market share has fallen from 31% to 29% in the past three years even as the group has opened 5m square feet of new shopping space, which is as much as Aldi operates in total in the UK, calculates McCarthy. That statistic alone makes a strong argument that shareholders' long-term interests are best served by swallowing some stiff financial medicine immediately to fund a better offer for customers. A 195p share price, incidentally, would return Tesco to a level first seen in 1998, the second year of Sir Terry Leahy's 13-year reign. That was also the time when Tesco became serious about expanding overseas, which may not be a coincidence. As is now horribly clear, UK customers were milked to fund overseas misadventures such as China and the US. Fixing \u2013 or selling \u2013 remaining parts of the empire will be Lewis' second task. It will take time. Lewis \u2013 who knows? \u2013 may be able to find a way through the thicket without halving profits, but the 6% yield on the shares says the current dividend is almost certainly knackered. Hurra for voting transparency Welcome news from Norway: Norges Bank Investment Management has told the FT that it will declare publicly and in advance how it will vote at shareholder meetings. What's that got to do with us? Well, Norges, manager of much of the country's oil wealth, is a monster of a fund. It has $870bn under management and chunky holdings in many large UK companies. It has influence both on the companies it invests in and on the fund management industry. Norges' thinking on transparency is excellent. Funds are answerable to their members. There is no reason why those members shouldn't be able to see in advance how their managers will vote. Let the ultimate beneficiaries join the debate. The industry's standard practice on revealing votes after the event (if at all) merely encourages the notion that fund managers have privileged insights that would be spoiled if they were shared. Nonsense. When it comes to voting on the boardroom and governance, there's no commercial disadvantage to airing an opinion. More fund managers should follow Norges' example. Company chairmen wounded by pay revolts would no longer be able to plead that shareholders never signalled their unhappiness in advance. And fund managers, investors of other people's money, remember, would have to demonstrate more clearly that they are thinking about how directors are paid and how boards are run. It's not much to ask. Shudders at Shire Are Susan Kilsby, chairman of Shire, and her boardroom colleagues getting nervous? Investors on the outside are. The drugmaker's shares are trading 10% below the price at which it has agreed to be taken over for \u00a331bn by US group AbbVie and the reason is obvious. Part of the financial appeal of the deal relies on a tax \"inversion\" by AbbVie, which plans to flip its domicile to the UK, and President Obama is on the warpath against US \"corporate deserters\". For the time being, Shire and AbbVie can afford to say nothing and pray the US Treasury doesn't follow through on its threat to act against inversions. But when the time comes to vote in the autumn, Kilsby will have to assess the risk. She has wisely negotiated a break fee should AbbVie walk away. But she is also inviting investors to accept part payment in AbbVie. Those shareholders will want to know how the merged company's financials would look if the tax gains suddenly evaporated. There will have to be a full answer.",

      "body": "<p>If you thought the Co-operative Group had already voted to adopt Lord Myners' ideas on how the organisation should be governed, think again. That 100% vote in favour in May was merely on the principles behind the Myners proposals. Now here come the actual proposals and, after a spin in the Co-op washer, some of the colours have faded.</p> <p>Here, for example, is what Myners said about the importance of keeping unqualified lay directors (patron pastor: Paul Flowers) off the main board: \"To insist on at least a token presence is akin to insisting that Manchester United should field a side which included at least three players from Rochdale FC.\"</p> <p>So what's this in the Co-op's final proposals? Three individuals on a slimmed-down main board of nine people will be \"member-nominated directors\".</p> <p>Don't worry, argues Co-op chair Ursula Lidbetter, a high bar will apply to ability and experience; the nominations committee will have teeth, employ headhunters and search widely. In other words, a Flowers-style applicant wouldn't get a look-in because he or she would fail to meet \"the high standards of competence commensurate with the needs of a business of the scale and complexity of the Group\".</p> <p>As long as that turns out to be the case, no harm may come of diluting Myners' purer vision. The risk, of course, is that expectations are managed downwards over time and the height of the bar comes to be set by the stature of the applicants.</p> <p>As Myners notes dryly, the commitment to setting the bar high would be greater if the lay directors who sat on the board \"over the last five disastrous years\" made it clear they won't stand for election. He's right. Once those failed directors have resigned, they should stay resigned.</p> <p>In other respects, the proposals for the new setup look sensible, and roughly as originally advertised. Of course, the arrangements are less than straightforward, but that's the Co-op: it's not a plc.</p> <p>There will be a council of up to 100 members to guard the organisation's soul and values and hold the board to account. This will have a president and, blimey, there will also be 10-15 \"senators\". Nice job title, but something less grand might suit Co-op's current station. In case anyone has forgotten amid the governance debate, the Co-op still has a very large pile of debt that needs to be paid down.</p> <p>Still, the final proposals on governance are a vast improvement on the old regime.

First, an appreciating exchange rate, which has risen 10% over the past year, is making UK-produced goods more expensive abroad.

      "bodyText": "And with that, we\u2019re done for the week. Thanks for all your comments and see you on Monday. The Baltic states are likely to be hit hard by Russia\u2019s ban on almost all food coming from the West, writes Mats Persson from Open Europe. [Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia] have lived in Russia\u2019s geopolitical shadow for centuries. When Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite (who by the way would have made an excellent European Commission President) was asked earlier this year if she didn\u2019t fear Putin, she referred to when Lithuania, as the first Soviet republic, declared independence in 1990, leading Moscow to impose eight-month long sanctions against Vilnius. Grybauskaite said, \u201cNo hot water. No energy. We were sitting with our gloves and coats in our offices\u2026 we survived. We\u2019re not afraid and we\u2019re used to this neighbour.\u201d He argues that there is a \u201cmoral case of sorts\u201d go compensate the disproportional burden shouldered by these three states as a result of the sanctions, but notes the potential complications of such a move. If you give compensation to one, you have to give to others. If the situation escalates this could suddenly become an unexpectedly large cost (think France and Mistral). As we\u2019ve warned before, that\u2019s the thing about sanctions, for better or worse, they\u2019re unpredictable. And what form would the compensation take? Would it come from the EU budget or via individual member states? And, would EU countries be able to agree? There\u2019s been plenty of activity in the oil markets today, after the US started bombing Iraq. The Pentagon announced that US warplanes struck artillery that was being against Kurdish forces defending the regional stronghold of Irbil. Brent crude rose more than $1 during the day but has since pared gains, to trade below $106 a barrel. It is now trading 42 cents up on the day at $105.86 a barrel. The rouble is set to end the week close to an all-time low following the announcement that Moscow would ban most food imports from the west in retaliation for sanctions over Ukraine. Igor Akinshin of Alfa Bank said: The markets are preparing for the worst based on what\u2019s going on in east Ukraine, where the fighting continues, no one wants to agree with anyone and Russia is building up troops on the border. The rouble fell 1.7% against the dollar, nearly hitting its all-time low of 36.73, last seen in March after Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea peninsula. Back to the Co-op and another lukewarm response to the restructuring it announced this morning (see below). The Institute of Directors says: In broad terms, the proposals announced today by the Co-op are a step in the right direction. Nonetheless, the overall governance structure at the Co-op remains somewhat confusing. Indeed, the Co-op group needs to adapt its governance model to the realities of the modern global economy, just as private sector boards have needed to become more professional over the last decade. We remain concerned that of the nine members of the Board, three will still be elected by other members. Without an entirely independently appointed board, there remain concerns about how much independent oversight the board will be able to exercise. This was an opportunity for a decisive change of direction for the Co-op and whilst significant progress has been made, we would like them to have gone further in addressing their governance problems. Royal Bank of Scotland is disbanding its controversial Global Restructuring Group (GRG), which was previously accused of deliberately forcing customers into default to make a profit. Derek Sach, the head of the division, will leave the bank, as will Aubrey Adams, who headed up the property function within GRG. Max Colchester at the WSJ reports: Laura Barlow has been appointed to head up RBS\u2019s restructuring activities. Her team will work alongside the group\u2019s existing businesses to help clients who are struggling with repayments. Some of the assets that are currently being restructured are being moved to the state-owned bank\u2019s \u201cbad bank,\u201d these people say. RBS was accused last November in a report by a former government adviser, Lawrence Tomlinson, of putting some distressed commercial clients out of business in order to scoop up assets for its own West Register property business. But Clifford Chance, the law firm commissioned by RBS to undertake an inquiry into the Tomlinson allegations, said there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of fraudulent activity, although it criticised other aspects of the bank\u2019s practices. Sach was defending the group just two months ago, insisting that it was not a profit centre, was not aggressive to its customers and had not threatened to remove overdrafts from small business customers. He told MPs on the Treasury select committee: Generally [I] do believe we do good overall. Market update at lunchtime. The FTSE is down by 0.5%, having regained some ground after hitting a near four-month low of 6552 points earlier in the day. Hantec Markets analyst Richard Perry said: At every corner, it seems that something else comes out of the woodwork that gives people another reason to sell. France CAC 40 down 0.3% Germany DAX down 0.8% Spain\u2019s IBEX up 0.3% FTSE MIB up 1% Some more reaction to the UK economic data. Chris Williamson at Markit says: The trade figures are some of the worst seen in recent history, and likely worsen further in July after PMI survey data showed manufacturing expanded at the slowest rate for a year in July, caused primarily by a deterioration in export growth. Exporters are being hit on two fronts. First, an appreciating exchange rate, which has risen 10% over the past year, is making UK-produced goods more expensive abroad. Second, already weak demand in many overseas markets is being hit further by growing uncertainty about the Ukraine crisis, especially in northern Europe. Escalating geopolitical events in Gaza and Iraq add to the sense that global risk aversion is creeping higher, which will inevitably mean slower economic growth. Rob Wood at Berenberg Bank says the conflicting data highlights the lopsided nature of the recovery. Escalating tensions in Ukraine seem to be weighing on the internationally exposed manufacturing sector, but construction output, the strong services PMI and rapidly rising house prices suggest the domestic recovery still has plenty of legs. There\u2019s some tub-thumping from the British Chambers of Commerce. David Kern says: [The disappointing trade] figures confirm that the pace of the UK\u2019s rebalancing towards net exports is far too slow, and if this continues we risk missing out on the Prime Minister\u2019s target of increasing exports to \u00a31tn by 2020. If we in Britain are serious about rebalancing our economy, we must invest even more in supporting and promoting international trade. On its part, the MPC must resist calls for early interest rate rises and reassure businesses that when rates start rising, increases will be modest and gradual to avoid any unwelcome surprises. Lord Myners, the City veteran charged with reforming the Co-op, has responded to the group\u2019s reforms announced today. He said: The proposals do not go as far as I recommended in my review of governance but they represent significant progress in the right direction. The acid test will be whether they are able to attract outstanding candidates to join the board without compromising on necessary standards. There needs to be rigorous application of a high test for membership of the board given the demanding business challenges facing the group. The commitment to setting the bar at the right level wold be greater if those lay directors who have sat on the board over the last five disastrous years made clear that they accepted that they fell well short of the new standard and said that they would not be standing for election to the board. Back to Italy, where parliament approved a package of support measures for the ailing economy late last night, including a cut in energy costs for small companies and measures to encourage lending to businesses. But Reuters reports that many fear the reforms do not go far enough: The package, dubbed the \u201ccompetitiveness decree\u201d when it was presented by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s government in June, got a lukewarm reception from business leaders who said it lacked a clear strategy and failed to address the real needs of industry. Prominent industrialist Alberto Bombassei, chairman of brake-maker Brembo, said the competitiveness decree contained too many minor measures and was of no help to business which would benefit far more from a reduction in corporate tax rates. \u201cIt seems a clear sign that the government has lost its direction at the moment,\u201d he said in an interview in La Stampa daily on Friday. Good read in the Standard about the City train fare dodger. Joshi Herrmann writes: The [Financial Conduct Authority] says it can\u2019t confirm or deny whether it is investigating Burrows but a spokesman said that, hypothetically, a crime such as not paying for train fares could \u201cspeak to the character\u201d of an individual, pricking its interest. When deciding whether someone was fit and proper to operate in finance, the FCA said: \u201cOne of the matters is whether the person has been the subject of any adverse finding or any settlement in civil proceedings, particularly in connection with investment or other financial business, misconduct, [or] fraud.\u201d Mario Draghi may have chosen to holiday there but he was pretty damning about Italy in the ECB press conference yesterday, saying it can only blame itself for slipping into a triple-dip recession. More on Bloomberg. Reporters Stefan Riecher and Alessandro Speciale point out that Italy ranked 65th out of 189 countries globally in the World Bank ease-of-doing-business survey, right behind St. Lucia, Belarus and Fiji. The GlaxoSmithKline trial has begun in China. Our reporter in Shanghai, Jonathan Kaiman reports: A British man and his American wife have appeared in a Shanghai court in the first formal hearing after they were accused of illegally obtaining private information about Chinese citizens. Peter Humphrey, 58 \u2013 a coporate sleuth hired by GlaxoSmithKline \u2013 and his 61-year-old wife, Yu Yingzeng, have been detained since last July on suspicion of using illegal means to get the data. GSK\u2019s China office, which is currently the target of a separate corruption probe, was one of their last clients. The year-long case has sent chills through the country\u2019s foreign business community. Here\u2019s Capital Economics on the UK trade data. June\u2019s trade data provide further evidence that the economic recovery is struggling to rebalance towards the external sector. There are plenty of headwinds which mean that exporters may continue to struggle in the near term. For one, the full effects of sterling\u2019s appreciation over the past year have probably not been felt yet. And second, the euro-zone\u2019s economic recovery remains extremely fragile. Accordingly, we doubt that the trade deficit will narrow substantially over the rest of the year. UK construction data is more upbeat, with a 1.2% increase in June, after falling by the same amount in May. That means construction is up by 5.3% in the year to June. Shaun Richards makes a good point about trade figures constantly missing forecasts. Reuters does point out: The [UK\u2019s] trade performance has been volatile in recent months due to so-called erratic goods such as aircraft, which are high in value and traded infrequently. Overall the value of goods exports fell by 1.9% in June; imports fell by 0.3%. Exports to the EU were little changed. The UK government has been trying to help British exporters, but its efforts have been hampered by weak demand in the eurozone. The UK\u2019s trade gap widened unexpectedly in June, as eurozone troubles hit demand for British exports. The ONS said the trade deficit for goods grew to \u00a39.4bn from \u00a39.2bn in June, compared with forecasts that it would shrink to \u00a38.8bn. The trade surplus in services partially offset those figures, shrinking the overall trade deficit to \u00a32.5bn. The US intervention in Iraq is just the latest in a string of events to hit the markets. UBS analysts Matthew Mish and Thibault Colle list the following... a more hawkish Fed stance heightened geopolitical risks Argentina\u2019s default another bank collapse and panicky bailout in Europe (Banco Espirito Santo) and concerns over stretched valuations The combination has seen a major shift out of risky assets to safe havens. Alternative Economics reports that investors took $7.1bn out of junk bond funds in the past week \u201ca record amount, according to Lipper\u201d. Wolf Richter writes: After having been inflated to dizzying proportions, the junk-bond bubble has been pricked. And the hot air is hissing out of it. Overnight, embattled Malaysia Airlines was taken into state hands after two high-profile disasters that killed hundreds of people. Agencies in Kuala Lumpur report: The business outlook for the Malaysian flagship carrier deteriorated after one of its aircraft, flight MH370, disappeared on 8 March. The airline\u2019s problems deepened on 17 July when another jet, flight MH17, was shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. The disastrous run sped up efforts for the government to restructure the airline, sources said \u2013 even before two almost unfathomable crashes the carrier\u2019s financial performance was among the worst in the industry. The disasters sparked a slump in bookings, which hurt already struggling operations. Malaysia\u2019s state investment fund will pay 1.4 billion ringgit (\u00a3260m) to buy out the company, a 12.5% premium to the closing share price on Thursday. The Independent has a good story on HSBC, which has been accused of \u201cshamelessly profiling\u201d its customers by ethnicity and closing bank accounts belonging to Syrian refugees and students in the UK. Maria Tadeo reports: Documents and email correspondence obtained by The Independent show that HSBC, which styles itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s local bank\u201d, sent letters to Syrian clients living in the UK telling them their accounts would be closed and giving them two months to find a new bank. It cited \u201cincreased requirements for compliance with international obligations concerning payments to and from sanctioned countries\u201d. The letters claimed that the decision to terminate their accounts was based on the bank\u2019s \u201cown assessment of risk\u201d and did not reflect the manner in which they conducted their business. The world\u2019s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, posted a huge loss in the second quarter, almost three times bigger than analyst forecasts. Italy\u2019s third biggest bank \u2013 which received \u20ac4.1bn in state aid last year \u2013 said net losses for the three months to June stood at \u20ac179m. That compares with forecasts of a \u20ac57.5m loss. Reuters reports: Bad loans are the major problem for Italian banks ahead of a pan-European review of lenders\u2019 assets and they are a major troublespot for Monte dei Paschi in particular because it has the highest proportion of soured loans among Italian lenders. Official figures out this week showed Italy slid into recession again, which will make it even harder for banks to keep a lid on bad debts. The markets have opened down, as traders take fright at the prospect of US airstrikes in Iraq adding to rising geo-political tensions around the world. FTSE 100 is down 0.5%, or 36 points at 6562 Germany DAX down 1.1% Italy FTSE MIB down 1.2% Spain IBEX down 1% France CAC 40 dwon 0.9% In the UK, the troubled Co-operative Group has unveiled proposals to change the way it is run, including crucial concessions on its board structure. While former City minister Lord Myners had recommended removing all the democratically elected members of the Co-op from the board, the mutual is now offering those members three seats on the board. More from my colleagues Julia Kollewe and Jill Treanor. There were very strong trade figures out of China overnight, pushing the trade surplus for July to an all-time high of $47.3bn. That is a 50% increase on June, and 170% higher than last year. Exports surged 14.5% from last year, to hit $213bn, as markets around the world recover, driving demand for Chinese goods. Imports dropped 1.6% to $166bn, helped by declines in commodity prices. Stock markets around the world fell and oil surged, as investors reacted to news that the US will carry out airstrikes on Iraq. Obama said in a late night statement: When we face a situation like we do on that mountain, with innocent people facing the prospect of violence on a horrific scale and we have a mandate to help - in this case a request from the Iraqi government - and when we have unique capabilities to act to avoid a massacre, I believe the United States cannot turn a blind eye,\u201d the president said in a late-night statement from the White House. Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed almost 3% down, while Australian shares were 1.3% lower. European markets are expected to follow suit. Brent crude jumped 0.9% to $106.39 a barrel, as the prime oil-producing region plunged further into chaos. Investors fled to safe haven assets, driving prices of US Treasuries higher and yields down.

Still, if you already know you have an interest in math or science, you might be better off picking a career as a chemist, a construction manager or even an economist, all of which have narrower-than-average gender pay gaps, than as a financial advisor or accountant, where the gaps are wider than average. </p> <p>The \u201cfeminist\u201d strategy: make sure you\u2019re aware of pay patterns in the industry you choose, and if it is one characterized by a big gender gap, be prepared to negotiate your starting salary, bonuses and subsequent raises particularly attentively.</p> <h2>When do you choose to start saving, and how do you invest?</h2> <p>The earlier you start saving, the more likely you are to emerge in a stronger financial position, able to make independent decisions. Watching the adventures and misadventures of the fictional Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City was great fun, but she\u2019s a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jill-knapp/6-reasons-why-carrie-bradshaw_b_5316301.html\">crappy role model</a> for reasons that have nothing to do with whether or not she\u2019s a feminist or her attitudes towards casual sex. </p> <p>Anyone who can spend $40,000 on designer shoes without realizing it, and end up with only $1,600 or so in the bank \u2013 and risk being homeless because she can\u2019t get a mortgage to buy her apartment \u2013 is probably the single biggest reminder of the consequences of the choices we make.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The troubled Co-operative Group has rowed back on a proposal by City veteran Lord Myners to remove democratically elected members from its board, under plans for sweeping internal changes announced on Friday. Seeking to draw a line under a disastrous year in which the 150-year-old mutual came close to collapse, the Co-op is proposing a board that is composed mainly of independent directors, alongside two executives. The proposals are broadly in line with what Lord Myners recommended apart from one key point: he had proposed removing all the democratically elected members from the board. The mutual is offering members three seats on the board in the hope that this concession will persuade its members to support the reforms. Lord Myners said: \"The proposals do not go as far as I recommended in my review of governance but they represent significant progress in the right direction. The acid test will be whether they are able to attract outstanding candidates to join the board without compromising on necessary standards.\" Pointedly calling for a new set of Co-op members to join the board, he added: \"The commitment to setting the bar at the right level would be greater if those lay directors who have sat on the board over the last five disastrous years made clear that they accepted that they fell well short of the new standard and said that they would not be standing for election to the board.\" The Institute of Directors voiced similar concerns. Referring to the retention of three elected members on the board, the IoD's corporate governance adviser, Oliver Parry, said: \"Without an entirely independently appointed board, there remain concerns about how much independent oversight the board will be able to exercise.\" However, Parry also welcomed the Co-op's proposals as a \"welcome break from the failings of the past\". The Co-op's interim chief executive, Richard Pennycook, hailed the proposals as a \"significant step towards meaningful reform\" which, if approved by members, will \"mark the end of the rescue phase for the group\". He added: \"It will be a very different board than we have at the moment and for the first time we'll have a couple of executive directors sitting on the board.\" Under the proposals the Co-op's board will be slashed from 18 members to 11. The Co-op chair, Ursula Lidbetter, insisted that only people with \"business acumen and commitment to cooperative values and principles\" would be chosen to serve on the board. \"The bar will be high \u2013 the most important thing is to have a highly skilled board,\" she said. Pennycook added that experience of other organisations, for example in the education or public sector, could be considered relevant. After weeks of discussions following the annual meeting in May where members agreed in principle to an overhaul, the proposals will be put to a vote at a special meeting on 30 August. The Co-op's first-half results will be published just a few days later, on 4 September. The mutual still needs to find a new chief executive to replace Euan Sutherland, who quit in March after details of his \u00a36.6m pay deal were leaked. It appears to have made little progress, with Lidbetter saying that management had been \"working flat out\" on governance reform. Myners had recommended a complete overhaul of the board, which is currently populated entirely by Co-op members. The former City minister was brought in after the organisation slumped to a \u00a32.5bn loss, the worst in its history, and was forced to give up control of its banking arm after admitting catastrophic mismanagement. Its former chairman, Paul Flowers, nicknamed the \"crystal Methodist\", resigned in disgrace amid a drugs scandal. Myners quit in May after encountering fierce resistance to his plans. Lidbetter said the mutual was \"very grateful\" to the City veteran for the work he had done. \"We built on that. You can still see the pillars that the Myners team put together.\" The new board will comprise an independent chair as recommended by Myners, five independent non-executive directors, two executive directors including the chief executive, and three member-nominated directors. Lidbetter will step down after a transitional period while Pennycook, a turnaround specialist, wants to return to his previous role of chief operating officer, and will in all likelihood sit on the board. Another important change is a switch to \"one member, one vote\". At the moment, some members are more powerful than others. The Co-op plans to start recruiting new board members immediately. A 100-strong council, led by a president elected for two years, will represent members and act as guardian of the mutual's values. A senate with 10-15 members, elected by the council, is to help coordinate its activities and act as a go-between with the board, the executive and members. Competency tests will also be applied to the council and the senate. Lidbetter said: \"These governance reforms represent the final crucial step in delivering the necessary change to restore the group and return it to health. This has been a process built on co-operation, focusing above all on creating a society where every member has a voice in shaping the group's future.\" Co-operatives UK, the independent body for the co-operative sector, has backed the new structure. The Co-op has decided to focus on supermarkets, funeral homes, general insurance and legal services. It sold its farms business to the Wellcome Trust for \u00a3249m this week, and offloaded its pharmacies for \u00a3620m last month. Pennycook said the mutual expected to sell its much smaller cash handling unit in the next month.",

Referring to the retention of three elected members on the board, the IoD's corporate governance adviser, Oliver Parry, said: \"Without an entirely independently appointed board, there remain concerns about how much independent oversight the board will be able to exercise.\" However, Parry also welcomed the Co-op's proposals as a \"welcome break from the failings of the past\".</p> <p>The Co-op's interim chief executive, Richard Pennycook, hailed the proposals as a \"significant step towards meaningful reform\" which, if approved by members, will \"mark the end of the rescue phase for the group\".

      "bodyText": "Britain's trade position worsened in June, as exports fell for a third month in another blow to the government's ambitions to rebalance the economy. The trade in goods deficit widened unexpectedly to \u00a39.4bn from \u00a39.2bn in May after British exports fell more than imports according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Economists had expected the deficit to shrink to \u00a38.8bn, and said that tensions between Russia and the west, a weak eurozone economy, and a strong pound making British goods more expensive abroad, were all likely to weigh on foreign demand for UK goods in the short term at least. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said Britain's trade position was likely to deteriorate in the coming months, weighing on UK growth. \"The trade figures are some of the worst seen in recent history. Exporters are being hit on two front. First, by an appreciating exchange rate, which has risen 10% over the past year. \"Second, already weak demand in many overseas markets is being hit further by growing uncertainty about the Ukraine crisis, especially in northern Europe. Escalating geopolitical events in Gaza and Iraq add to the sense that global risk aversion is creeping higher, which will inevitably mean slower economic growth.\" George Osborne has long argued that a sustainable future for the UK economy depends on a lesser reliance on debt-fuelled spending and the financial services and a greater reliance on manufacturing and exports. The chancellor set a target in 2012 of doubling UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020, but so far the rebalancing of the economy has proved elusive. The June data completed the trade picture for the second quarter, and showed a widening of the goods deficit to \u00a36.9bn from \u00a35.5bn in the first quarter. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg said the latest figures highlighted \"the lopsided nature of the UK's recovery\". Exports fell by \u00a3400m in June to \u00a323.5bn, largely driven by a drop in oil exports and manufacturing goods. Imported goods fell by \u00a3100m to \u00a332.9bn after a fall in oil and aircraft imports. Britain's main trading partners are the European Union and the US. In a bid to create demand for UK goods elsewhere and improve Britain's global trade position, Osborne has led various trade missions to some of the world's emerging powers, including China. However the ONS said June's fall in both exports and imports was driven by a drop in trade with countries outside the EU in the latest setback for those ambitions.",
