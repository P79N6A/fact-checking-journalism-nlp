      "bodyText": "The Duke of Westminster\u2019s death has led to calls from tax campaigners to reform the system of trusts which has allowed Britain\u2019s wealthiest families to preserve fortunes through generations by avoiding death duties. The 7th Duke of Westminster, 25-year-old Hugh Grosvenor, is now the heir to a legacy worth more than \u00a39bn. Thanks to a series of trusts, which are thought to date to the death of the 2nd Duke in 1953, Hugh and his three sisters will avoid having to pay the 40% levy ordinary families are faced with when parents die. \u201cFor people who are really wealthy, inheritance tax has become an optional choice,\u201d said John Christensen, director of the Tax Justice Network. \u201cIf you are lucky to be born into a very wealthy family you will be untaxed. For most normal people this is extraordinary and unacceptable. \u201cWealth that has become concentrated in the hands of a very small minority. Without some kind of wealth tax those concentrations will simply continue to become greater and greater. I think there should be complete reform of inheritance tax.\u201d Pressure groups are calling on the government to publish its new central register of trusts, which names their beneficiaries and settlors. They want an obligation to publish annual accounts for those collections of assets deemed to have public interest, such as the thousands of acres of urban and rural land owned by the Grosvenor family. Richard Murphy, the chartered accountant and political economist whose ideas have been adopted by the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, said the latest chapter in the history of the Dukes of Westminster highlighted the need for reform. \u201cWe should require that these trusts publish their annual accounts just like a private company,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cAnd we need a register of trusts. The need for privacy around some trusts is understandable. But where there is public interest, where they are trading, where there are substantial assets over a a certain value, the accounts should be published.\u201d Despite arguing publicly for greater tax transparency, the former prime minister David Cameron intervened personally to water down proposals by the European Parliament that would have obliged not only private companies but also trusts to make the names of their beneficiaries public. In a letter sent to the president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, in November 2013 the British prime minister argued trusts should be treated differently. \u201cIt is clearly important we recognise the important differences between companies and trusts,\u201d Cameron wrote. \u201cThis means that the solution for addressing the potential misuse of companies, such as central public registries, may well not be appropriate generally.\u201d Britain\u2019s lobbying was successful. Europe\u2019s fourth money laundering directive, enacted last year, obliges member states to create central registers of trusts. But there is no requirement for the register to be available to the public, and it need only list taxable trusts. Information on beneficiaries can only be accessed by \u201ccompetent authorities\u201d, meaning police and tax inspectors, plus bankers, lawyers and accountants making money laundering checks. George Hodgson, interim chief executive of the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners, has argued for central registers to remain private because many beneficiaries are children or vulnerable adults. The inheritance tax exemptions help to protect jobs, he added. \u201cAn awful lot of trusts are used to hold family businesses, be they farms or manufacturing businesses. Successive governments have decided that is in the best interests of the economy and therefore the public at large. Family businesses would face significant consequences if they were subject to full inheritance tax. A lot would end up being broken up and sold off.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct, which parliament has criticised for treating its lowest-paid workers \u201cwithout dignity or respect\u201d, also appears to be struggling to convince its white collar employees that it is a good place to work. Turnover among the embattled retailer\u2019s salaried UK staff, which includes those employed at its headquarters and managers in its stores, rose by more than three percentage points last year, to 22%, according to its annual report. The figure is almost three times the average turnover rate of 8% for UK employers, according to a survey last year by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. In its annual report, the sportswear chain states: \u201cStore manager stability with Sports Direct is currently sitting at 80.4%, this is a decrease of 12 [percentage points] on the [2015 full year] figure. Assistant manager and footwear manager stability currently sit at 79.8% and 83.5% respectively, which is a decrease of six [percentage points] and seven [percentage points] across the positions.\u201d The rising staff turnover rate will add to the pressure on Mike Ashley, Sports Direct\u2019s billionaire founder and majority shareholder. Jane Chesters, a partner at human resources consultancy Orion Partners said: \u201cZero churn among staff is not a good thing, but 20% within management roles would be a challenge to an organisation. \u201cWhen it comes to store manager roles, the productivity of a store can be as much to do with the calibre of the store manager as the location or the product. If you get high turnover [in those roles] it can have a significant commercial impact.\u201d The company\u2019s share price has shed more than 60% over the past year following scandals about its treatment of low-paid workers and concerns over its trading performance. It has also been operating without a full-time finance director since December 2013. A scathing parliamentary inquiry found last month that Ashley had been running Sports Direct in a manner \u201ccloser to that of a Victorian workhouse than that of a modern, reputable high street retailer\u201d, building his success on a business model that treated workers \u201cwithout dignity or respect\u201d. The report by the business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, which was triggered by a Guardian investigation last year, said Ashley had used \u201cappalling working practices\u201d and treated his \u201cworkers as commodities rather than as human beings\u201d. Ashley gave evidence to the committee in June, when he said the retailer had grown too large for him to manage. He also admitted the company had broken the law by failing to pay staff the national minimum wage. His admission confirmed the findings of undercover Guardian reporters, who revealed that the company was paying staff less than the legal minimum wage. HM Revenue &amp; Customs is now investigating Sports Direct for breaching the wage law. The company responded to last year\u2019s reports by announcing an internal review of its working practices to be led by Ashley, plus a pay rise for staff, which it said would cost it \u00a310m. The moves have failed, however, to quell negative headlines. At the group\u2019s AGM next month, shareholders will vote on a resolution calling for an independent review of its treatment of employees. The resolution brought by the Unite trade union calls on the board to commission an investigation to report back within six months. Sports Direct did not respond to a request for comment. Its annual report states: \u201cWe estimate that [the staff turnover] figure will reduce during the remaining 2011 share scheme vesting period. \u201cOur share schemes are utilised to attract, motivate and incentivise our people and potential future employees. We have found that creating a shared goal has improved employee satisfaction levels.\u201d In the summer of 2015, the group handed 2,000 managers and other permanent staff share bonuses worth almost \u00a3155m in total and an average of \u00a377,000, as part of a four year performance scheme started by Sports Direct in 2011. The payout was triggered when the group beat targets for increasing its top-line operating profit every year for four years. However, targets on a new 2015 share scheme have been missed, meaning it has failed to pay out and has now lapsed.",

    "webTitle": "Hopes rise for Tata Steel rescue deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tata Steel is increasingly confident about securing a rescue deal for its UK business and the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales, after talks with the business secretary and the Pensions Regulator. Approximately 11,000 jobs are at risk after Tata Steel threatened to pull out of the UK. However, a senior source close to the process said an agreement to secure the future of Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot was \u201cnearly there\u201d, although it might not be finalised until the final quarter of the year. Negotiations to save the business are complicated. Tata Steel shelved plans to sell its UK operations after David Cameron\u2019s government offered hundreds of millions of pounds of financial support and indicated it was ready to change the law so the company could restructure its pension scheme, which has a deficit of \u00a3700m. Tata Steel now plans to merge its European operations, including the UK business, with ThyssenKrupp. It will also sell its speciality steels business and its pipe mills, which are based in northern England and employ about 2,000 people. However, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp will include the UK operations in the tie-up only if the pension scheme can be restructured and the package of support from the government \u2013 which includes loans on commercial terms worth up to \u00a31bn \u2013 can be secured. This has been complicated by the EU referendum and the change of prime minister. Greg Clark, the business secretary, held positive talks with the Tata chairman, Cyrus Mistry, in India on Wednesday. Clark\u2019s predecessor, Sajid Javid, had pledged to help Tata Steel UK and Theresa May\u2019s government is understood to be supportive of the plan. \u201cThey are following the same route as previous,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe sentiment is the same.\u201d Talks with ThyssenKrupp are understood to be progressing well. The German conglomerate said on Thursday the EU referendum would not impact on the potential deal, but had slowed the progress of talks. Guido Kerkhoff, ThyssenKrupp\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cBrexit is something that definitely effects us on the timeline. For the discussion, it\u2019s actually neutral.\u201d He declined to say when the talks were likely to be completed, adding: \u201cSometimes one has to live with uncertainty.\u201d Tata Steel is in talks with the Pensions Regulator about the British Steel pension scheme, which was inherited by the Indian company when it bought Corus for \u00a36.2bn in 2007. The scheme has 130,000 members, liabilities of \u00a315bn and a deficit of \u00a3700m. Tata Steel is examining various options to restructure the pension scheme and lower the deficit. It is understood that the options no longer include the government changing the law so that the inflation-based annual increase in benefits is connected to the lower consumer price index, rather than the retail price index. The law change was backed by Javid, despite concerns from the Department for Work and Pensions and the Pension Protection Fund that it could create a dangerous precedent. A restructuring of the scheme could involve Tata Steel pumping money into it in return for a change in workers\u2019 benefits. A spokesperson for the Pensions Regulator said: \u201cWe continue to engage with the trustees, employer and government on the issues facing the British Steel pension scheme. We will only comment in more detail if and when it is appropriate to do so.\u201d The government said it was committed to finding a \u201clong-term viable future\u201d for the steel industry in the UK. A spokesperson for the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, created by May, said: \u201cThis is a difficult time for steel workers in Port Talbot and across the UK. The government is committed to helping the steel industry secure a long-term viable future in the UK.\u201d Trade union leaders have grown frustrated at the time it has taken Tata Steel to resolve the future of its UK business. The Indian company first warned that the future of Tata Steel UK was being reviewed in March. This led to heavy criticism of the government for not doing enough to support the industry. Javid was in Australia with his daughter when Tata Steel made the announcement. Tata Steel then invited bids for the business. It eventually shortlisted seven proposals, including a management buyout and a bid from the energy tycoon Sanjeev Gupta. However, the government\u2019s pledge to provide hundreds of millions of pounds of financial aid encouraged Tata Steel to reconsider its position and the bids were dismissed as unattractive. Tata Steel\u2019s drive to rebuild the UK business has become less urgent because the pressure on the steel industry has eased. Earlier this year Tata Steel was losing more than \u00a31m a day in the UK, with an influx of cheap steel from China driving down prices. However, steel prices have risen since March. The fall in the value of sterling also means that Tata Steel\u2019s exports have become more attractive and it is more expensive for Chinese companies to import steel into the UK. A Tata Steel spokesman said: \u201cWe remain committed to achieving the best possible outcome for our UK business. Our aim remains to find a sustainable future for our UK business. There are a number of options which we are pursuing to achieve that.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Tata Steel is increasingly confident about securing a rescue deal for its UK business and the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales, after talks with the business secretary and the Pensions Regulator.</p> <p>Approximately 11,000 jobs are at risk after Tata Steel threatened to pull out of the UK. However, a senior source close to the process said an agreement to secure the future of Tata Steel UK and<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/tata-steel-financial-aid-pledge-remains-despite-scrapping-of-sale\"> Port Talbot</a> was \u201cnearly there\u201d, although it might not be finalised until the final quarter of the year.</p> <p>Negotiations to save the business are complicated. Tata Steel shelved plans to sell its UK operations after David Cameron\u2019s government offered hundreds of millions of pounds of financial support and indicated it was ready to change the law so the company could restructure its pension scheme, which has a deficit of \u00a3700m. </p> <p>Tata Steel now plans to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/08/tata-stops-port-talbot-plant-sale-as-talks-begin-with-german-steel-group\"> merge its European operations, including the UK business, with ThyssenKrupp</a>. It will also sell its speciality steels business and its pipe mills, which are based in northern England and employ about 2,000 people.</p> <p>However, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp will include the UK operations in the tie-up only if the pension scheme can be restructured and the package of support from the government \u2013 which includes loans on commercial terms worth up to \u00a31bn \u2013 can be secured. This has been complicated by the EU referendum and the change of prime minister.</p> <p>Greg Clark, the business secretary, held positive talks with the Tata chairman, Cyrus Mistry, in India on Wednesday. Clark\u2019s predecessor, Sajid Javid, had pledged to help Tata Steel UK and Theresa May\u2019s government is understood to be supportive of the plan.</p> <p>\u201cThey are following the same route as previous,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe sentiment is the same.\u201d</p> <p>Talks with ThyssenKrupp are understood to be progressing well. The German conglomerate said on Thursday the EU referendum would not impact on the potential deal, but had slowed the progress of talks.</p> <p>Guido Kerkhoff, ThyssenKrupp\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cBrexit is something that definitely effects us on the timeline. For the discussion, it\u2019s actually neutral.\u201d </p> <p>He declined to say when the talks were likely to be completed, adding: \u201cSometimes one has to live with uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>Tata Steel is in talks with the Pensions Regulator about the British Steel pension scheme, which was inherited by the Indian company when it bought Corus for \u00a36.2bn in 2007. The scheme has 130,000 members, liabilities of \u00a315bn and a deficit of \u00a3700m.</p> <p>Tata Steel is examining various options to restructure the pension scheme and lower the deficit. It is understood that the options no longer include the government changing the law so that the inflation-based annual increase in benefits is connected to the lower consumer price index, rather than the retail price index. </p> <p>The law change was backed by Javid, despite concerns from the Department for Work and Pensions and the Pension Protection Fund that it could create a dangerous precedent.</p> <p>A restructuring of the scheme could involve Tata Steel pumping money into it in return for a change in workers\u2019 benefits.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Pensions Regulator said: \u201cWe continue to engage with the trustees, employer and government on the issues facing the British Steel pension scheme.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Mail is facing a battle with its 140,000 workers after unions threatened a campaign of action against plans to slash pension benefits. Royal Mail\u2019s plan to switch 90,000 workers out of their current pension arrangements into a new scheme that will pay out lower benefits emerged on Wednesday. If the cuts are similar to plans at the Post Office\u2019s near-identical pension scheme, it could see some workers lose up to half their projected pension. The Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents most of Royal Mail\u2019s workforce, said it overwhelmingly rejected the pension changes. Terry Pullinger, CWU deputy general secretary, said: \u201cIt is unfortunate that Royal Mail\u2019s actions have resulted in this issue being in the public domain prior to any formal consultation. \u201cThe CWU do not accept that closure of the Royal Mail Pension Plan is inevitable and will explore every avenue to defend it. We will challenge any convenient leap by the employer to close the scheme and move the entire onus on to our members.\u201d Royal Mail said the cost of its pension scheme will balloon from \u00a3400m to \u00a3900m a year unless it cuts the scheme. It wants to prevent workers from building up any future entitlement to the current career average-based pension scheme, and switch them to a pension where the outcome is entirely dependent on stockmarket movements. Pullinger added: \u201cIt is very concerning that the recent press articles, which have prompted this statement, give an impression of fait accompli. Royal Mail will need to bring far more imagination into these ongoing discussions and should be in no doubt that the CWU will use every means at our disposal to encourage the company to think again and secure an agreement that defends our members\u2019 incomes and dignity in retirement.\u201d Royal Mail said an existing agreement runs out in March 2018 and it welcomed talks. In a statement it said: \u201cWe are committed to constructive, ongoing talks with our unions about the future of the plan after March 2018.\u201d The CWU is already engaged in a battle with the Post Office, which split from Royal Mail on privatisation in 2012, over changes to its pension scheme. It called a strike ballot over changes to the Post Office pension, and other working arrangements at crown post offices, and said it expects a resounding vote in favour of action. Severe cracks are appearing in many final salary-style pension schemes because what appear to be esoteric movements in gilt yields \u2013 interest paid on government bonds \u2013 are having a dramatic impact on the financial viability of pensions. Since the EU referendum result, gilt yields have plummeted to historic lows, with interest rates on some government bonds turning negative. This hits pension funds, as gilt yields are a major component in valuing the future liabilities of a scheme. Each time yields fall, the gap between assets and liabilities grows, throwing many schemes into deficit. Figures earlier this week from the Pension Protection Fund revealed that the total deficit at nearly 6,000 of the UK\u2019s biggest company pension schemes had widened by more than \u00a324bn in a month to reach a new high of \u00a3408bn. The latest rise in the deficit of schemes covered by the pensions lifeboat points to the difficulty in tackling troubled schemes including BHS, where former owner Sir Philip Green is battling to \u201csort\u201d the problem, and Tata Steel, where a pensions restructuring could be key to a rescue bid. The latest deficit estimate comes after a 31% rise announced last month in the wake of the Brexit vote but before this month\u2019s decision by the Bank of England to cut interest rates to 0.25% and start pumping money into the economy. A spokesperson at the Pension Protection Fund said: \u201cRecord lows in gilt yields continued to put pressure on pension scheme funding. \u201cTotal liabilities increased in cash terms but the ratio of assets to liabilities is still above the all-time low of 76.4% in May 2012.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Deliveroo chief executive should know what it feels like to be a food delivery worker. When Will Shu launched the food delivery service from his London flat in 2013, the American made deliveries on his scooter for the first eight months, albeit to better understand the business\u2019s complex logistics rather than to pay the bills. The idea was hatched from Shu\u2019s experience working long hours as an investment banker on Wall Street in the early 2000s. At Morgan Stanley he received a $25 dinner allowance to sustain late-night number crunching, which he and his colleagues splurged on takeaways from local restaurants. Getting nice restaurants to deliver to your office proved to be a tougher ask when Shu transferred to the bank\u2019s London office. \u201cI was literally working the same hours as in New York but I had to go to Tesco\u2019s every night ... it just became really depressing,\u201d he told one interviewer. Ready for something new, in 2010 Shu, who was born in Connecticut to Chinese parents, returned to the US to do an MBA. After graduating, he teamed up with his childhood friend Greg Orlowski, who had been working as a software engineer. The pair went on to launch the business in early 2013 with just three restaurants on board, one of whom was the owner of the restaurant Shu lived above on the capital\u2019s upmarket King\u2019s Road in Chelsea. While Shu has been the enthusiastic public face of Deliveroo, Orlowski, a fellow American, has shunned the limelight. According to his modest LinkedIn profile, the 37-year-old was the architect of the Deliveroo logistics system and website. He left the business this year to spend more time with his wife and young family in Chicago. At that time, Shu said: \u201cWithout him, the business would not be what it is today and we remain close friends.\u201d Still just 36, Shu, who is single and lives in London\u2019s trendy Notting Hill, has stayed on to lead Deliveroo\u2019s charge for global domination. While its army of couriers are upset about being shortchanged by plans to replace an hourly wage with commission, investors cannot throw enough money at the company. Last week, Deliveroo revealed it had raised another $275m (\u00a3212m) from investors to fund expansion. It has now raised close to $500m with some analysts saying it is close to joining the \u201cunicorn\u201d herd, a label given to tech startups such as Uber and Airbnb judged to be worth more than $1bn. It may yet prove to be hubris, but Shu\u2019s old scooter has been sprayed gold and has pride of place in Deliveroo\u2019s trendy London offices.",

At Morgan Stanley he received a $25 dinner allowance to sustain late-night number crunching, which he and his colleagues splurged on takeaways from local restaurants. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/deliveroo-drivers-protest-london-changes-pay-structure\">Deliveroo riders protest in London against changes to pay structure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Getting nice restaurants to deliver to your office proved to be a tougher ask when Shu transferred to the bank\u2019s London office. \u201cI was literally working the same hours as in New York but I had to go to Tesco\u2019s every night ... it just became really depressing,\u201d he told one interviewer. </p> <p>Ready for something new, in 2010 Shu, who was born in Connecticut to Chinese parents, returned to the US to do an MBA. After graduating, he teamed up with his childhood friend Greg Orlowski, who had been working as a software engineer. The pair went on to launch the business in early 2013 with just three restaurants on board, one of whom was the owner of the restaurant Shu lived above on the capital\u2019s upmarket King\u2019s Road in Chelsea. </p> <p>While Shu has been the enthusiastic public face of Deliveroo, Orlowski, a fellow American, has shunned the limelight. According to his modest LinkedIn profile, the 37-year-old was the architect of the Deliveroo logistics system and website. He left the business this year to spend more time with his wife and young family in Chicago. At that time, Shu said: \u201cWithout him, the business would not be what it is today and we remain close friends.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fa683abd2b2f853fa2792bc3c00c3b5d590623d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa683abd2b2f853fa2792bc3c00c3b5d590623d2/0_75_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deliveroo riders protest outside the company\u2019s headquarters in London on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deliveroo riders protest outside the company\u2019s headquarters in London on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still just 36, Shu, who is single and lives in London\u2019s trendy Notting Hill, has stayed on to lead Deliveroo\u2019s charge for global domination. While its army of couriers are upset about being shortchanged by plans to replace an hourly wage with commission, investors cannot throw enough money at the company. </p> <p>Last week, Deliveroo revealed it had raised another $275m (\u00a3212m) from investors to fund expansion. It has now raised close to $500m with some analysts saying it is close to joining the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/14/square-ipo-unicorns-silicon-valley-tech-bubble\">unicorn</a>\u201d herd, a label given to tech startups such as Uber and Airbnb judged to be worth more than $1bn.

      "bodyText": "The US law firm investigating the diesel emissions scandal at Volkswagen is to examine the conduct of BHS directors in the run-up to the retailer\u2019s collapse. Jones Day has been hired by FRP Advisory, the BHS joint administrator responsible for winding up the business, to scrutinise transactions by the retailer while it was controlled by Dominic Chappell and Sir Philip Green. The law firm is a heavyweight in the legal industry and is conducting an internal investigation for VW into how cheat software was installed into its diesel vehicles. The appointment of Jones Day to scrutinise BHS was first reported by Sky News. BHS collapsed into administration in April, putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving a pension deficit of \u00a3571m. The last of the company\u2019s 164 shops will close on 20 August, while its flagship store on Oxford Street in London will close this weekend. The demise of BHS is being investigated by the Insolvency Service, the Pensions Regulator and the Financial Reporting Council. The Serious Fraud Office is also examining whether there are grounds to launch a criminal investigation. A parliamentary investigation into the collapse of BHS, led by Labour MPs Frank Field and Iain Wright, accused Green of representing the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. Green and other investors collected \u00a3586m in dividends, rent and interest during his family\u2019s 15-year ownership of BHS. He sold the retailer for \u00a31 in March 2015 to Chappell, a serial bankrupt. Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, extracted another \u00a317m from BHS before it collapsed this year. FRP was brought in as the second administrator to BHS by the Pension Protection Fund, the company\u2019s biggest creditor. The PPF did not publicly explain why it wanted another administrator to work with Duff &amp; Phelps, which was initially appointed. However, Chappell claimed to MPs that Duff &amp; Phelps were Green\u2019s \u201cponies\u201d and \u201cdo exactly what Philip tells them to do\u201d. Green denied this. Duff &amp; Phelps said in its reports to creditors, published in June, that it had identified transactions within BHS that required further investigation. \u201cDuring our preliminary investigations there are a number of transactions that on the face of it may require investigation. Additional information is required to understand the true nature of the transactions,\u201d it said. The chief executive of BHS, Darren Topp, told MPs that Chappell had his \u201cfingers in the till\u201d during his ownership of BHS. In their report, MPs said Green and Chappell had overseen the \u201csystematic plunder\u201d of BHS. Chappell has claimed that all payments made to Retail Acquisitions were contractually agreed, while Green has said that significantly more was invested in BHS than taken out while he was in charge.",

      "bodyText": "Dr Szuhsiung \u201cAllen\u201d Ho is, according to a motion filed by his lawyer, a 66-year-old American citizen who was born in Taiwan, educated in the US and lives in Wilmington, Delaware. In character statements submitted to a court in Tennessee, friends and neighbours described him as an honest and law abiding member of the community who loved the US and would eventually be exonerated of charges of nuclear espionage brought against him by the US government. Ho came to the US in 1973 to attend the University of California and married his wife Anne a year later. He received a PhD in nuclear engineering from the University of Illinois in 1980, and became a naturalised US citizen three years later. . The couple are childless, but Ho fathered a son outside the marriage in 2007. Neighbours said his wife had declared herself willing to help raise the child in the US. They are described as active members of the local Chinese American Community Centre in Wilmington, where Anne Ho is involved in running a women\u2019s book club. The couple live in a large house in the town, which has sizeable Chinese community, but Ho spends much of his time in China working for his nuclear consulting business, Energy Technology International, which was set up in 1996. Prosecutors say he has two flats in China, one of his own and another for his son and the boy\u2019s mother. Ho has worked as a consultant for China General Nuclear Power, which has a 33% stake in the UK\u2019s \u00a318bn Hinkley Point C project. Prosecutors allege that he enticed US nuclear experts at the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority energy corporation to pass sensitive information to Beijing by paying them bribes. They also allege that he failed to register with the Department of Justice as an agent of a foreign state and that he is paid by the Chinese government. Ho is charged with helping a foreign power produce nuclear material, a term that refers to enriched uranium and plutonium for nuclear reactor fuel. His lawyer, Peter Zeidenberg, said in court papers Ho had \u201cno expertise or experience in the development or production of special nuclear material\u201d. He said Ho was helping nuclear plants in China to run safely in order to avoid a Chernobyl-style disaster. Ho was arrested in Atlanta, Georgia, in April and has been jailed pending trial. If found guilty he could face life in prison. Zeidenberg has requested bail, pointing out that Ho, 66, is \u201cnot a young man\u201d and is \u201cpoorly equipped for dealing with the stress and potential dangers inherent in detention\u201d. He said that at one facility where Ho was held, he had to be segregated from other inmates after they were heard discussing a plan to harm him. \u201cIt has been brutal for him in every way imaginable,\u201d a friend of Ho\u2019s said. Neighbours and family friends have provided statements praising his character, according to filings with the court intended to support his bail request, which will be heard on Tuesday. Gwen and David Chen, also of Wilmington, said Ho was a \u201cbright, honest, warm, mild, likable [sic], and friendly man\u201d, adding that the allegations \u201cmust be some misunderstanding\u201d. Friend Amy Chien said he was a \u201cman of filial piety\u201d who always visited his family in Taiwan when he travelled to China and was \u201cwell liked and respected in his circle of friends\u201d. Shirley and Evan Tseng said he spent a lot of time in China for work, but that he had \u201croots deeply planted in Delaware\u201d and loved the US. \u201cThis is his home and his country, and he would never betray it,\u201d they said. Ho\u2019s sister-in-law, Donna En Ning Lee, said Ho \u201chas not \u2013 nor will he ever \u2013 evade the law\u201d and offered to put her house up as a bail bond. Zeidenberg said Ho was not a flight risk, had no criminal history or drug or alcohol problems, and was prepared to submit to house arrest with an ankle bracelet to monitor his movements.",

      "bodyText": "After a rollercoaster day - exaggerated by thin trading during the summer lull - European markets showed some substantial gains. It was an opening surge on Wall Street to a new record, following better than expected results from the likes of department store group Macy\u2019s as well as a 3% jump in the oil price, that helped pull European shares sharply higher. The FTSE 100, in negative territory for much of the day, managed to end the day at a new 14 months high. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE-100 has certainly been in for a volatile session...and once we take into account the toll stocks moving ex-dividend have exacted on the index, we\u2019re looking at a rather upbeat performance. That said, we\u2019re in the midst of the summer lull so thinner volumes will lend themselves to exaggerated market moves, but with more positive noises being made over oil prices stabilising, Wall Street has opened in an upbeat mood too \u2013 if these tailwinds continue, then it seems that soon enough the FTSE-100 will once again be starting with a \u201c7\u201d. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 48.29 points or 0.7% at 6914.71, its best level since 3 June 2015 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.86% to 10,742.84 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.17% at 4503.95 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.06% to 16,969.69 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.7% at 8719.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.89% to 572.33 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 129 points or 0.7%. Oil continues to rise, with Brent crude climbing 5% at one point. It is now up 4.5% at $46.05 a barrel. As for the pound, it is now down 0.36% at $1.2961 and 0.21% lower at \u20ac1.1614. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Oil continues to rise, in turn supporting global stock markets. As well as the International Energy Agency saying markets would rebalance, crude has also been boosted by comments from the Saudi oil minister about possible action to stabilise prices. Khalid al-Falih said OPEC members and non-members would discuss the market situation and any action needed at their meeting at the end of September in Algeria. Traders had been sceptical about the prospects of the OPEC meeting taking any action to stem production, especially since Saudi Arabia reported record output in July. But these new comments have helped send Brent crude up 3.4% to $45.57, while West Texas Intermediate is 3.5% higher at $43.21. So on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been testing new highs, and is currently up 131 points or 0.7%. The pound continues to weaken. It is now at around \u20ac1.1600 against the euro, down 0.33% and at its lowest level since 6 July. In the wake of the Brexit vote it hit a post referendum low of \u20ac1.1575 on that date, according to Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Olive. Against the dollar, sterling is down 0.35% at $1.2965. US markets are in buoyant mood after the oil price steadies, US weekly jobs claims fell again and a number of companies including department store group Macy\u2019s and US listed Chinese internet group Alibaba issued positive updates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 49 points or 0.26%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are also moving higher. Oil prices have edged higher after the International Energy Agency said crude markets would rebalance in the coming months. In its latest monthly report, it predicted oil stocks would reduce in the third quarter for the first time in more than two years. It said: Oil\u2019s drop...has put the \u2018glut\u2019 back into the headlines even though our balances show essentially no oversupply during the second half of the year. Brent crude is currently up 0.6% at $44.32 a barrel, having earlier fallen as low as $43.46. The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, is up 0.5% at $41.93 a barrel after hitting $41.1. Former deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sir Charles Bean, has been nominated by UK chancellor Philip Hammond to the Budget Responsibility Committee of the Office for Budget Responsibility. The vacancy at the independent OBR, which scrutinises the government\u2019s finances, comes because Sir Stephen Nickell is due to step down in December. Sir Charles said: I am delighted that the Chancellor has nominated me for appointment to the OBR\u2019s Budget Responsibility Committee. Sir Stephen Nickell and the rest of the BRC have done excellent work in establishing the credibility and reputation of the OBR, and I will be honoured to take up the post should the Treasury Committee wish me to do so. Earlier it was announced that the Office for National Statistics had begun recruiting its first data analytics apprentices, following a critical review into the quality of economic data by Sir Charles. Over to Russia, and a preliminary report from the Federal Statistics Service showed a 0.6% fall in GDP in the second quarter. But this is an improvement on recent quarters: Back with Brexit, and another suggestion that the UK economy is suffering after the vote to leave the European Union. A Reuters poll of nearly 60 economists indicated they expected the economy to contract by 0.1% in the third and fourth quarters. Ahead of the vote, they had expected similar growth to the 0.6% recorded in the second quarter. Most of those surveyed also thought the Bank of England would reduce interest rates again in November to just 0.1% after this month\u2019s reduction in borrowing costs. Two thirds of those who answered a question on fiscal measures expected the government to come up with some sort of fiscal stimulus in the Autumn statement. Back to Mongolia! The FT points out that the country\u2019s currency, the t\u00f6gr\u00f6g*, has hit a new record low today, thanks to those worries over its economy. * - bonus mark to anyone who knew that 1 t\u00f6gr\u00f6g = 100 m\u00f6ng\u00f6s If job creation was an Olympic sport, then the USA would be taking home yet another medal. The weekly job figures, just released, show that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell by 1,000 last week, to 266,000. That suggests that the US labour market is in robust health, with employers still creating new jobs. This is the 75th week running in which the initial claims figure has been below 300,000, the traditional threshold for a strong labour market. Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Weisenthal has more details: Today is so quiet that we\u2019d happily trek to Outer Mongolia for a decent bit of news..... ...and, bang on cue, Mongolian bonds are suffering a serious rout, after the government warned it faces an economic crisis. Reuters has the details: Bonds maturing in 2021 and 2022 fell 4.6 cents and 5 cents respectively, to their lowest since end-June . The 2018 bond fell 1.8 cents to 2-1/2-month lows. The selloff was sparked by the new finance Minister Battogtokh Choijilsuren, who warned earlier this week that the government may struggle to pay public sector wages. The Mongolian People\u2019s Party won a sweeping victory last month. But the honeymoon didn\u2019t last long, with Choijilsuren warning that: \u201cThe economic situation is difficult but our government is optimistic that we can develop a comprehensive plan to get out of this crisis.\u201d Choijilsuren also spoke about \u201ca deep state of economic crisis\u201d, leading investors to worry about Mongolia\u2019s ability to avoid a default. Mongolia is rich in minerals, and commodities such as coal and copper, but has been hit by falling demand from emerging economies such as China. It\u2019s shaking up to be a calm day on Wall Street, where traders expect the main share indices to open slightly higher in 80 minutes time. Sofa maker DFS isn\u2019t worried about Brexit, though. The company has hiked its profit forecast this morning, and hopes to get a sales boost out of sponsoring the Olympics (a curious tie-up, until you remember where most of us watch the action). CEO Ian Filby has told us that he expects the consumer market to remain quite resilient, despite the EU referendum uncertainty. A new survey has shown that consumer confidence has dipped in August to a two-year low. The Thomson Reuters/Ipsos Primary Consumer Sentiment Index (PCSI) eased to 49.2 from 49.4 in July. That level was last seen in early 2014. The survey found that Brits are more concerned about losing their jobs, but actually less pessimistic about the wider economy. Rating agency Moody\u2019s has joined the chorus of concern over Britain\u2019s property sector. In a new report, it predicts that the buy-to-let sector will be particularly badly hit by the Brexit vote. Recent changes to stamp duty rules, which hit second home owners, will also hurt BTL prices. Kamran Sabir, a Moody\u2019s vice president, says: \u201cWith reduced demand for credit and downward pressure on house prices, economic uncertainty will likely reverse previously positive market conditions for the UK mortgage market.\u201d The weakening pound is going to hit British holidaymakers in the pocket. Holiday group TUI has warned that sterling\u2019s recent tumble will inevitably make package tours more expensive: It\u2019s one of those days... Capital Economics predict that UK house price inflation will fall to 2% by the end of this year. They do see some glimmers of light in today\u2019s report by Britain\u2019s surveyors: This morning\u2019s RICS survey reported that the new buyer enquiries balance improved a little, from minus 36% in June to minus 27% in July. (See Chart.) And the new sales instructions balance rose from minus 45% to minus 33%. But the big picture is that the market is softening. After all, most of the readings from June were deep in negative territory and multi-year lows. So despite the modest improvements seen this month, the survey still points to fewer new buyers and sellers in July than in June. And, with the newly agreed sales balance at minus 34% and the past prices balance at 5%, the data are consistent with falling sales and low, single-digit house price growth. Swiss bank USB reckons that the pound will fall to $1.25 in the next three months, as the Bank of England launches more stimulus measures: UBS strategists Constantin Bolz and Thomas Flury say: \u201cIn our view, it is very likely that further monetary easing will be delivered in the coming months, which would weaken sterling.\u201d Ouch. Sterling has fallen to its lowest level against the US dollar since July 7. The pound has shed more than half a cent to $1.295, as traders react to the slowdown in UK housing market. Sterling is also suffering from the Bank of England\u2019s new QE programme. That\u2019s because the BoE will sending a lot of pounds overseas, to buy UK government debt from foreign investors. Kit Juckes, currency expert at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, explains: The foreign exchange conclusion of the BOE buying bonds off foreigners is very simple and sterling-negative. Throw in a soft RICS housing survey released overnight and the pound\u2019s woes don\u2019t get any less. More property gloom, via the FT.... Derwent London, the UK property landlord, has become the latest real estate group to caution that Britain\u2019s vote to leave Europe is likely to lower demand for office space in London and it has cut its expectations for growth in rental income for this year. The group, which has assets in London locations such as Clerkenwell and Fitzrovia, is braced for a slowdown in momentum in the second half of the year and has reduced its estimate of rental growth for the whole of 2016 to 1-5 per cent from a previous forecast of 5-8 per cent. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, predicts the UK housing market will suffer from the Brexit vote for some time: RICS housing prices showed that prices dipped by a drop to +5 for the month of July indicating one of the most significant drops since the middle of 2013. This trend looks set to continue as the UK struggles with the fallout and the housing market is likely to be a crucial gauge of consumer sentiment following its rapid rise over the last two years. A weaker currency is likely to fuel demand from abroad but the domestic market looks set to suffer which will permeate other crucial areas of the economy. The government should look to act swiftly to stem any unrest in these sectors so as not to cause panic amongst consumers. The former head of London estate agent Greene &amp; Co reckons buyers should be cautious: Some more context: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index had tumbled by 50 points, or almost 1%, in early trading. And housebuilding companies are leading the selloff, following the news that house price growth has hit a three-year low. Berkeley Group has fallen by 5.4%, Taylor Wimpey are down 2.1% and Barratt Development has lost 1.9%. Travis Perkins, which supplies building products, are down 2.5%. Today\u2019s report from RICS contains several charts, showing how the UK housing market slowed sharply in July. These two illustrates how house price growth slowed in July, and the number of people enquiring about properties. The slowdown is worst in the East and West midlands: And this chart shows how RICS\u2019s survey is often a good leading indicator of where the housing market is headed: Britain\u2019s house prices rose at the slowest rate in three years in July, in the latest sign that the EU referendum has hurt the economy. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reports this morning that house price growth, and transaction levels, fell sharply last month following the Brexit vote. RICS\u2019s headline price balance fell to +5 in July from +15 in June, its lowest level since April 2013. This means that just 5% more respondents nationally saw a rise rather than fall in prices. RICS says: \u2022 House price growth falters in July and near term expectations remain negative \u2022 Sales and enquiries drop further - although expectations point to a more stable picture in the coming months \u2022 Stock levels at record lows in most parts of the UK as new instructions decline markedly The decline was particularly sharp in London, reflecting concerns that the capital will suffer from the June 23 vote to leave the EU. But.... RICS also reckons that the property sector is only suffering a wobble, rather than a full-blown meltdown. Most surveyors expect prices to be higher in 12 months time, and a majority expect to be handling more sales too. That\u2019s partly because Britain still suffers from an \u201cacute shortage of property for sale\u201d. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Rics, remains optimistic, saying: \u201cThe rebound in the key 12 month indicators in the July survey suggest that confidence remains more resilient than might have been anticipated.\u201d Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, flags up that house prices in some London areas are already falling: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Today, City investors are fretting about the Bank of England\u2019s new stimulus programme after its new bond-buying spree drove UK borrowing costs to record lows. Some gilts yields turned negative yesterday after the BoE bought up \u00a31.17bn of government bonds. That\u2019s very bad news for pension funds who rely on government debt for their income. As we report this morning: Anticipation that the Bank will keep buying bonds has helped push up their price \u2013 which in turn pushes down on the yield \u2013 and for some three- and four-year bonds the price rose so much that the yield turned negative. Negative yields have happened once before since the 23 June vote, effectively meaning that the government does not have to pay any money to encourage investors to buy its debt. Pensioners face a double-whammy right now, with the BoE also slashing interest rates to just 0.25%. Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, fears that Mark Carney and colleagues are wilfully ignoring savers, saying: The Bank wants to stimulate the economy by bringing down interest rates, but the Bank is not acknowledging the negative impact these measures are having on pension deficits, and neither is the government. It\u2019s possible that gilt yields could hit fresh record lows today, given that pension funds are reluctant to give up their precious long-dated government debt. Also coming up today.... Holiday firm TUI is updating the City on its financial performance, in the light of the Brexit vote. The oil price is under pressure after the OPEC cartel warned that demand could be weak in 2017. We get another insight into the US economy at 1.30pm BST, when the weekly jobless report is released. Traders are expecting European stock markets to drop a little in early trading: And so far, that\u2019s it. Fingers crossed for more news....",

    "webTitle": "BHS scandal has long way to run despite shutters coming down", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The BHS scandal is far from over, in fact it may only just be starting. The flagship store on Oxford Street in London is pulling down its shutters for the final time this weekend and the last of the retail chain\u2019s 164 outlets around the country will all be closed by the following Saturday. However, the news that Jones Day has been brought in to investigate the conduct of BHS\u2019s directors in the run-up to its collapse shows that questions remain unanswered. Jones Day has been brought in by FRP Advisory, the joint administrator to BHS. It is standard practice for an administrator to bring in a law firm to help with an insolvency process, but this appointment stands out for two reasons. Firstly, FRP was only appointed as the second administrator in June because the Pension Protection Fund \u2013 the biggest creditor to BHS \u2013 wanted a second opinion alongside the initial administrator Duff &amp; Phelps. Secondly, Jones Day is a heavyweight US law firm. FRP could have brought in a less prestigious law firm to just help it tick a few boxes, but it has chosen the outfit that is a leading an internal investigation into the diesel emissions scandal at Volkswagen. The parliamentary report into the collapse of BHS, led by the Labour MPs Frank Field and Iain Wright, provided an impressive and detailed account of how the 88-year-old retailer was brought to its knees. It heavily criticised Sir Philip Green, the former owner of BHS, accusing him of plundering the company for his own financial gain. Field has subsequently described the billionaire tycoon as \u201cevil\u201d and asked the Serious Fraud Office to look into whether money was illegally moved around to make Dominic Chappell, who led the consortium that bought BHS from Green, look a credible buyer. Green clearly has a moral obligation, potentially a legal one too, to fill the \u00a3571m blackhole in BHS\u2019s pension scheme. However, Field\u2019s war of words with Green must not stop the mismanagement of BHS under Chappell from being thoroughly investigation. While the SFO and the Insolvency Service, which is also looking into BHS, will inevitably look into Chappell\u2019s acquisition of the retailer for \u00a31 from Green in March 2015, there are more questions about what happened in the following 13 months. These questions include: how did Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions extract at least \u00a317m from BHS while it owned the retailer? Did Retail Acquisitions breach contractual agreements with Green by taking money from the sale of BHS property? Was BHS money used to pay off the mortgage on Chappell\u2019s family home? Why did Chappell move \u00a31.5m from BHS into the unconnected BHS Sweden just days before it collapsed? The appointment of Jones Day will help to find the answers. Minimum wage The government on Thursday unveiled its new list of the companies failing to pay the minimum wage by trumpeting it as the \u201clargest ever\u201d. But the naming and shaming of so many offenders should not be celebrated; it is shameful. There are 198 employers on the list, including some recognisable names such as Greene King, Poundstretcher, and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Football Club. Sports Direct is not on the latest list, but founder Mike Ashley has admitted it is under investigation by HMRC for failing to pay staff the minimum wage. The retailer\u2019s latest annual report shows that staff turnover at the company rose to 22% last year. That is three times the national average and means that one in five at Sports Direct left the business in just 12 months. This suggests that staff are prepared to act if they are unhappy with their job. However, not all workers have the option of another job or the confidence to leave their position. The government must do more than simply name-and-shame or fine offenders. Company directors should be made personally responsible for paying their staff properly and face criminal charges if they don\u2019t. It is not difficult to ensure that staff are being paid. Virgin Media and Southampton The Premier League football season starts on Saturday after an extraordinary summer of spending, capped by Manchester United signing Paul Pogba for a world record fee of \u20ac110m (\u00a393.2m) just four years after letting him leave for \u00a3800,000. But in the parallel economic world of the Premier League, an interesting sponsorship agreement has been struck that will hopefully be a blueprint for the future. As part of its deal to sponsor Southampton, Virgin Media will subsidise tickets for away fans travelling to the south coast football club. This means ticket prices will be capped at \u00a320. The move has been welcomed by the Football Supporters\u2019 Federation, which is behind a \u201cTwenty\u2019s Plenty\u201d campaign to lower football ticket prices for travelling fans. The tie-up between Southampton and Virgin Media is evidence that the vast amounts of money flowing into football can be used to help supporters. Hopefully other companies and football clubs will follow the example.",

It is standard practice for an administrator to bring in a law firm to help with an insolvency process, but this appointment stands out for two reasons. </p> <p>Firstly, FRP was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/22/pension-fund-wants-new-insolvency-experts-to-investigate-bhs-collapse\">only appointed as the second administrator in June</a> because the Pension Protection Fund \u2013 the biggest creditor to BHS \u2013 wanted a second opinion alongside the initial administrator Duff &amp; Phelps. Secondly, Jones Day is a heavyweight US law firm. FRP could have brought in a less prestigious law firm to just help it tick a few boxes, but it has chosen the outfit that is a leading an internal investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/22/volkswagen-handling-emissions-scandal-shambles-investors-agm-german-carmaker\">diesel emissions scandal at Volkswagen</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-demise-sir-philip-green-reputation-torn-apart-in-damning-report\">parliamentary report into the collapse of BHS</a>, led by the Labour MPs Frank Field and Iain Wright, provided an impressive and detailed account of how the 88-year-old retailer was brought to its knees. It heavily criticised Sir Philip Green, the former owner of BHS, accusing him of plundering the company for his own financial gain. Field has subsequently described the billionaire tycoon as \u201cevil\u201d and asked the Serious Fraud Office to look into whether money was illegally moved around to make Dominic Chappell, who led the consortium that bought BHS from Green, look a credible buyer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/sir-philip-green-told-do-right-thing-bhs-pension-deficit\">Sir Philip Green told to 'do the right thing' and plug BHS pension deficit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Green clearly has a moral obligation, potentially a legal one too, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/06/bhs-pension-deficit-sir-philip-green-sort-it\">fill the \u00a3571m blackhole in BHS\u2019s pension scheme. </a> However, Field\u2019s war of words with Green must not stop the mismanagement of BHS under Chappell from being thoroughly investigation.</p> <p>While the SFO and the Insolvency Service, which is also looking into BHS, will inevitably look into Chappell\u2019s acquisition of the retailer for \u00a31 from Green in March 2015, there are more questions about what happened in the following 13 months.</p> <p>These questions include: how did Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions extract at least \u00a317m from BHS while it owned the retailer? Did Retail Acquisitions breach contractual agreements with Green by taking money from the sale of BHS property? Was BHS money used to pay off the mortgage on Chappell\u2019s family home? Why did Chappell move \u00a31.5m from BHS into the unconnected BHS Sweden just days before it collapsed?</p> <p>The appointment of Jones Day will help to find the answers.</p> <h2>Minimum wage</h2> <p>The government on Thursday unveiled its new list of the companies failing to pay the minimum wage by trumpeting it as the \u201clargest ever\u201d.

      "bodyText": "RWE has hailed a turnaround at its npower subsidiary in Britain, after winning back customers and reporting a 60% decline in complaints. Npower, one of Britain\u2019s big six energy companies, signed 100,000 domestic customers in July after losing a similar number between January and June. In the year to June, it had lost 350,000 accounts. The exodus of customers last year was exacerbated by billing issues that prevented the energy company from charging clients. Its German parent, RWE, Germany\u2019s second biggest utility company, responded with a shakeup of senior management at npower and embarked on a two-year restructuring plan. This appears to have paid off: the latest gains mean the total number, including business accounts, has risen to 5.2m, up from 4.78m at the end of last year. Unveiling first-half results, RWE\u2019s chief executive, Peter Terium, said npower restructuring had \u201cgot off to a good start\u201d, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re a bit ahead of plan.\u201d He added that npower\u2019s position had stabilised since the significant customer losses last year. He also said he thought the fallout from Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU would be manageable. Its bigger rival British Gas lost almost 400,000 customers in the first six months of 2016. Its parent, Centrica, said falling gas and power prices had brought new suppliers to the market, who had encouraged households to switch. The 3% fall in domestic customers left British Gas with 14.26m accounts. However, customer numbers started rising again in June. At npower, the number of complaints dropped 61% to 175,159 in the first six months of 2016, while late bills were down by a third, to 65,701. In December, npower was fined \u00a326m for sending out late and often inaccurate bills and failing to handle customer complaints effectively. Paul Coffey, who replaced Paul Massara as chief executive of npower a year ago, said: \u201cWe are starting to serve our customers better with much fewer customer complaints and much simpler processes. The recovery plan announced in March is beginning to bear fruit and we are delivering a solid performance on customer acquisition and retention versus our competitors for the first half of this year.\u201d In March, npower announced plans to slash 2,400 jobs, a fifth of its 11,500-strong workforce, to reduce costs. It slumped to an operating loss of \u00a399m for 2015 at its domestic energy business, compared with a profit of \u00a3183m a year earlier. Coffey admitted that \u201cthere is much more to do\u201d. Npower is expected to return to full-year profit by 2017. It made a \u00a367m profit in the first half of this year. Britain is RWE\u2019s second biggest market by customers after Germany. Npower accounts for about a fifth of RWE\u2019s sales. Its parent company posted a 7% drop in first-half operating profits to \u20ac1.9bn (pdf) (\u00a31.64bn), missing analysts\u2019 expectations, and blamed losses at its volatile trading business. RWE stuck to its outlook, with operating profit forecast to fall to between \u20ac2.8bn and \u20ac3.1bn this year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Steinhoff, the South African retail conglomerate, has increased its offer for struggling discounter Poundland after an activist investor amassed a shareholding with the potential to upset the takeover. Its offer, which had been accepted by the Poundland board, has been increased by 5p. Shareholders are now being offered 225p a share plus the 2p a share dividend announced in June for the year ending 27 March. The improved offer values the retailer at \u00a3610.4m. Steinhoff\u2019s chief executive, Markus Jooste, also made clear that the offer was \u201cfinal\u201d and would not be increased. He said 227p was a \u201chighly attractive\u201d 43.3% premium to the undisturbed share price, although it is still well below the 300p the retailer floated at just over two years ago. \u201cBy offering Poundland shareholders an improved cash offer we aim to bring certainty to the transaction, recognising the strength and value of the business and its management team,\u201d said Jooste. Steinhoff already owns Harveys and Bensons for Beds in the UK. Last month, it emerged that rebel investor Elliott Capital Advisors had taken control of a 13.2% stake in Poundland. Since then the US hedge fund, which has a history of pushing for better terms in takeovers, has bought more shares and now speaks for 17.5%. Steinhoff is buying Poundland via a \u201cscheme of arrangement\u201d, which means it needs the backing of investors representing 75% of the voting shares it does not already own to win control. Steinhoff, whose biggest shareholder is Christo Wiese, who also owns stakes in New Look, Iceland and Virgin Active through the Brait investment vehicle, already owns 23.6% of Poundland\u2019s shares so it would be possible to block its bid with a 19.1% stake \u2013 25% of the remainder. Because schemes of arrangement only take into account those who vote, either by proxy or at a special court meeting, if some shareholders choose not to vote at all, Elliott\u2019s stake could already be large enough to derail the takeover. \u201cThe 5p rise in the Steinhoff bid for Poundland is a pretty modest victory for shareholder activism,\u201d said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb, who suggested the small increase in the offer price would mean Elliott would \u201cbarely make it a profit\u201d for its efforts. Elliott declined to comment. Poundland\u2019s chairman, Darren Shapland, said the deal offered shareholders the chance to cash in their shares at \u201can improved price and on an enhanced premium to Poundland\u2019s undisturbed share price\u201d. \u201cSteinhoff continues to share our vision for the growth and expansion of Poundland and, as such, we believe they are a suitable and appropriate partner for our colleagues, suppliers and stakeholders,\u201d he said. At noon on Thursday, Poundland shares were down 2.5p at 221.5p.",

The improved offer values the retailer at \u00a3610.4m. </p> <p>Steinhoff\u2019s chief executive, Markus Jooste, also made clear that the offer was \u201cfinal\u201d and would not be increased. He said 227p was a \u201chighly attractive\u201d 43.3% premium to the undisturbed share price, although it is still well below the 300p <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/12/poundland-pets-at-home-float-share-price-ipo\">the retailer floated at just over two years ago</a>.</p> <p> \u201cBy offering Poundland shareholders an improved cash offer we aim to bring certainty to the transaction, recognising the strength and value of the business and its management team,\u201d said Jooste. Steinhoff already owns Harveys and Bensons for Beds in the UK.</p> <p>Last month, it emerged that rebel investor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/steinhoff-may-need-to-increase-offer-for-poundland\">Elliott Capital Advisors had taken control of a 13.2% stake</a> in Poundland. Since then the US hedge fund, which has a history of pushing for better terms in takeovers, has bought more shares and now speaks for 17.5%.</p> <p>Steinhoff is buying Poundland via a \u201cscheme of arrangement\u201d, which means it needs the backing of investors representing 75% of the voting shares it does not already own to win control. Steinhoff, whose biggest shareholder is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/27/christo-wiese-south-african-billionaire-prepares-for-move-to-uk\">Christo Wiese, who also owns stakes in New Look, Iceland and Virgin Active</a> through the Brait investment vehicle, already owns 23.6% of Poundland\u2019s shares so it would be possible to block its bid with a 19.1% stake \u2013 25% of the remainder. </p> <p>Because schemes of arrangement only take into account those who vote, either by proxy or at a special court meeting, if some shareholders choose not to vote at all, Elliott\u2019s stake could already be large enough to derail the takeover.</p> <p>\u201cThe 5p rise in the Steinhoff bid for Poundland is a pretty modest victory for shareholder activism,\u201d said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb, who suggested the small increase in the offer price would mean Elliott would \u201cbarely make it a profit\u201d for its efforts. Elliott declined to comment.</p> <p>Poundland\u2019s chairman, Darren Shapland, said the deal offered shareholders the chance to cash in their shares at \u201can improved price and on an enhanced premium to Poundland\u2019s undisturbed share price\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cSteinhoff continues to share our vision for the growth and expansion of Poundland and, as such, we believe they are a suitable and appropriate partner for our colleagues, suppliers and stakeholders,\u201d he said. </p> <p>At noon on Thursday, Poundland shares were down 2.5p at 221.5p.</p>",

Although DFS has not seen any impact on demand so far, it admitted that \u201cthe six weeks since 23 June is too short a period to permit a meaningful assessment of future furniture retail trends\u201d. The chief executive, Ian Filby, said any impact was likely to be limited. \u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged by the momentum so far. Unless you get a major economic hit like the credit crunch you find it\u2019s quite a resilient market.\u201d He noted that retail consultancy Verdict was predicting 3% growth per annum for the UK upholstery market. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s an important purchase it\u2019s not like buying a house. Every six to seven years people want to refresh their living room.\u201d He said people buying furniture when moving house accounted for less than a fifth of the UK sofa market. Cost pressures caused by the weaker pound were also likely to be limited, he said, because DFS makes many of its sofas in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire and buys most materials here, with a quarter of products sourced from Asia, in particular leather goods. Speaking from the Olympics in Rio, Filby said the company was hoping to become a more appealing brand through its sponsorship of Team GB. But he admitted the Games were a distraction, saying: \u201cAt times the Olympics can take people away from doing their sofa shopping.\u201d DFS, which returned to the London stock market last spring after a 10-year absence, reported a 7% rise in revenues for the year to 30 July, with second half revenues also up 7% from a year earlier. The group now expects to deliver results at the top end of forecasts. The City is predicting revenues of up to \u00a3755.5m and pre-tax profits of up to \u00a364.6m. Revenues have been boosted by the acquisition of Sofa Workshop and Dwell, store openings and improvements to the website, where sales are growing by double digits. The Doncaster-based company has 112 shops \u2013 105 in the UK and the rest in Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain. Stripping out acquisitions and store openings, DFS\u2019s like-for-like sales were estimated to have risen 4.5%.

    "webTitle": "Republicans have themselves to blame for the slow economy, study says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US\u2019s slow recovery from the 2008 recession is due to Republican policies on the local, state and federal level, according to a new study published by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute (EPI). The new report comes as the slow pace of recovery has emerged as a key battleground between Republican candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who will set out her economic policy on Thursday. The EPI report blames the lackluster pace of recovery on Republican-led budget cuts in 2011 following the row over the US debt ceiling, the unwillingness of local officials to spend money when Republicans in Congress were advocating cuts in spending, and the refusal to expand Medicaid in 19 states. The report comes as the Republican party once again calls for the reining in of government spending and reductions in the deficit. \u201cGiven the degree of damage inflicted by the Great Recession and the restricted ability of monetary policy to aid recovery, historically expansionary fiscal policy was required to return the US economy to full health,\u201d writes Josh Bivens, research and policy director at EPI. \u201cBut this government spending not only failed to rise fast enough to spur a rapid recovery, it outright contracted, and this policy choice fully explains why the economy is only partially recovered from the Great Recession a full seven years after its official end.\u201d This economic recovery has been the slowest over the past four business cycles. For example, the employment recovery from the trough of the Great Recession to its pre-recession peak took 51 months. Following the recession in the 1980s, employment recovery took 11 months. In the early 1990s it took 23 months, and in the early 2000s it took 39 months. The US government would have had to spend an additional $1tn in 2015 alone to match the spending that followed the 1980s recession, Bivens said. While such spending might run up the US deficit \u2013 something Republicans in Congress are opposed to \u2013 it would also have led to \u201cseveral years of full employment\u201d and the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates. There are few ways the government can help speed up economic recovery after a recession. One way is to cut interest rates to help increase borrowing, which should lead to increased spending. Similarly, to increase spending by consumers, the US government would typically cut taxes, essentially putting more money in people\u2019s pockets. The ability of the US government has been slightly limited this time around \u2013 especially when it comes to cutting the federal interest rates, which have been historically low. Interest rates At the time of the 1980s recession the federal fund interest rate was at 9.3%, whereas in the first quarter of 2009 it was 0.18%. \u201cThis means that there was much more room to move down the federal funds rates following the 1982 trough compared to the 2009 trough,\u201d Bivens wrote. Low interest rates combined with the potential of another recession are a concern for the US Federal Reserve. Fed chair Janet Yellen had previously said that the central bank has few tools to deal with another recession if it were to occur. Bivens argues that the federal government should have increased aid to state and local governments following the recession and that the Obama administration should have been more outspoken about its opposition to the fiscal austerity pushed by Republicans. The Obama administration \u201ccould have made a louder and more consistent case that the slow recovery had concrete, identifiable roots in decisions made by the Congress,\u201d Bivens wrote. \u201cHad the Obama administration made such a powerful case for why austerity was hampering growth, it could have educated the public and potentially helped build support for more sensible policy the next time the United States faces a recession.\u201d The EPI report was published hours before Clinton was scheduled to deliver her speech on the economy in Warren, Michigan. Warren is just slightly north of Detroit, where Trump delivered his economy speech earlier this week. In his speech, Trump said that the Obama-Clinton agenda had led to the loss of jobs and put undue restrictions on US businesses, making it difficult for them to compete in the global economy.",

      "body": "<p>The US\u2019s slow recovery from the 2008 recession is due to Republican policies on the local, state and federal level, according to a new study published by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute (EPI). </p> <p>The new report comes as the slow pace of recovery has emerged as a key battleground between Republican candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who will set out her economic policy on Thursday.</p> <p>The EPI report blames the lackluster pace of recovery on Republican-led budget cuts in 2011 following the row over the US debt ceiling, the unwillingness of local officials to spend money when Republicans in Congress were advocating cuts in spending, and the refusal to expand Medicaid in 19 states.</p> <p>The report comes as the Republican party once again calls for the reining in of government spending and reductions in the deficit. </p> <p>\u201cGiven the degree of damage inflicted by the Great Recession and the restricted ability of monetary policy to aid recovery, historically expansionary fiscal policy was required to return the US economy to full health,\u201d writes Josh Bivens, research and policy director at EPI. </p> <p>\u201cBut this government spending not only failed to rise fast enough to spur a rapid recovery, it outright contracted, and this policy choice fully explains why the economy is only partially recovered from the Great Recession a full seven years after its official end.\u201d</p> <p>This economic recovery has been the slowest over the past four business cycles. For example, the employment recovery from the trough of the Great Recession to its pre-recession peak took 51 months. Following the recession in the 1980s, employment recovery took 11 months. In the early 1990s it took 23 months, and in the early 2000s it took 39 months.</p> <p>The US government would have had to spend an additional $1tn in 2015 alone to match the spending that followed the 1980s recession, Bivens said. While such spending might run up the US deficit \u2013 something Republicans in Congress are opposed to \u2013 it would also have led to \u201cseveral years of full employment\u201d and the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates. </p> <p>There are few ways the government can help speed up economic recovery after a recession. One way is to cut interest rates to help increase borrowing, which should lead to increased spending. Similarly, to increase spending by consumers, the US government would typically cut taxes, essentially putting more money in people\u2019s pockets.</p> <p>The ability of the US government has been slightly limited this time around \u2013 especially when it comes to cutting the federal interest rates, which have been historically low.</p> <h2>Interest rates<br></h2> <p>At the time of the 1980s recession the federal fund interest rate was at 9.3%, whereas in the first quarter of 2009 it was 0.18%.</p> <p>\u201cThis means that there was much more room to move down the federal funds rates following the 1982 trough compared to the 2009 trough,\u201d Bivens wrote.</p> <p>Low interest rates combined with the potential of another recession are a concern for the US Federal Reserve. Fed chair Janet Yellen had previously said that the central bank has few tools to deal with another recession if it were to occur. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\" data-alt=\"Interest rates chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\">Interest rates chart</a> </figure>  <p>Bivens argues that the federal government should have increased aid to state and local governments following the recession and that the Obama administration should have been more outspoken about its opposition to the fiscal austerity pushed by Republicans. </p> <p>The Obama administration \u201ccould have made a louder and more consistent case that the slow recovery had concrete, identifiable roots in decisions made by the Congress,\u201d Bivens wrote. \u201cHad the Obama administration made such a powerful case for why austerity was hampering growth, it could have educated the public and potentially helped build support for more sensible policy the next time the United States faces a recession.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q3zq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2640383\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump outlines his economic plan \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a8d83ee4b0f5d064841920\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/08/160808economy_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\">Donald Trump outlines his economic plan</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><br>The EPI report was published hours before Clinton was scheduled to deliver her speech on the economy in Warren, Michigan.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s biggest travel company, Tui, has warned that UK holidaymakers will have to pay higher prices next summer due to the pound\u2019s tumble following the Brexit vote. The group stuck to its full-year profit forecast as it sold more package holidays to Spain, Greece and long-haul destinations, offsetting a sharp drop in tourism to Turkey and north Africa. Tui, which owns Thomson and First Choice, said UK revenues and bookings for this summer were up 6%, with \u201cno apparent slowdown in bookings as a result of the EU referendum\u201d. Friedrich Joussen, the chief executive, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a change in booking patterns since the referendum.\u201d However, he noted that sterling had lost 9% of its value against the euro, and said if this continued it would push up the cost of holidays next summer. He said: \u201cYes, you will see some price increases but in the last three years you didn\u2019t see price increases.\u201d Joussen noted that 60% of holidays sold in Britain were packages. Tui has sold 89% of its summer holidays in the UK, beating last year\u2019s figures. Long-haul bookings are up 16%, with Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica popular, as well as new destinations such as Costa Rica. UK bookings for the winter are up more than 20%, mainly to the Caribbean, Mexico, Thailand and Mauritius, as well as the Canaries and Cape Verde. Bookings for next summer have also got off to a good start. Tui, based in Hanover, Germany, reported underlying earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) of \u20ac180m (\u00a3155m) for its third quarter to 30 June, up 1.1%. Sales dropped 5.7% to \u20ac4.6bn, as demand dropped following the attempted coup and terrorist attacks in Turkey and a spate of other attacks in Europe. Like its rival Thomas Cook, Tui has switched holiday packages from the eastern to the western Mediterranean. Joussen said about 2 million customers had altered their travel plans, with bookings to Turkey down 40%. Egypt has also suffered while UK tour operators stopped offering package holidays to Tunisia for summer 2016. \u201cWhen you have a lot of incidents, that affects the industry,\u201d Joussen said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a rollercoaster, up and down,\u201d pointing to the failed coup attempt in Turkey and attacks in Nice, Paris and Brussels. However, he insisted that people were still travelling, albeit to other destinations. He was confident that customer numbers would be up from last year, and that Tui was on track to deliver at least 10% growth in underlying EBITA this year. Tui launched two cruise ships this summer and opened five hotels, with a further cruise ship due to join its UK fleet next summer. Thomas Cook has been hit more by the slump in travel to Turkey. The company lowered its full-year profit forecast last month, when it revealed a \u00a325m pretax loss on operations in the three months to June.",

Oil companies are lower as crude prices continue to slide, following an unexpected rise in US stocks on Wednesday, a rise in Saudi Arabian production and few hopes of any agreement to cut output at the next Opec meeting. So BP is down 2.2p at 420.80p and Royal Dutch Shell A shares have slipped 56.5p to \u00a318.60 as its shares went ex-dividend. With a downbeat housing survey, builders are also under pressure.

Meanwhile Tui has climbed 42p to \u00a310.54 as the travel group said it would meet its profit forecast for the year despite worries that terrorism would dampen consumer enthusiasm. The company is also less exposed than rivals to troubled areas like Turkey. Among the mid-caps there is a contrasting response to a couple of retailers. DFS has jumped 12.5% to 252p as the furniture group forecast full year results at the top end of expectations, but Card Factory has fallen 24.1p to 296.1p after disappointing first half results showed like for like sales growth of just 0.2%. On Card Factory, Liberum said: Overall, a disappointing update with store like for likes entering negative territory and online, primarily Getting Personal, flat.

      "bodyText": "Hedge funds and other western investors have been piling into gold this year, pushing investment to a record high and driving the price of bullion to its biggest first-half gain since 1980. The latest report from the World Gold Council, which represents gold miners, indicates that global gold demand reached 2,335 tonnes in the first six months of the year. Buying by institutional and retail investors, mainly in the west, hit a new high of 1,064 tonnes, 16% above the previous record set in the first half of 2009, at the height of the global financial crisis. Investment accounted for the biggest chunk of gold buying for two consecutive quarters \u2013 the first time this has ever happened. Exchange-traded funds, which track the spot price of gold, had a stellar first half, recording inflows of nearly 580 tonnes. Hedge funds, Japanese pension funds and bond investors, put off by low yields, have been buying gold amid heightened global uncertainty, according to John Mulligan, the industry body\u2019s head of member and market relations. He explained that gold, regarded as the ultimate safe haven, had become more attractive due to low or negative interest rates and uncertainty around the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU and the US presidential election. Investors have been snapping up gold bars and coins in several markets, notably the US where demand soared 101% between April and June, as gold eagle coins proved popular. The Royal Mint posted a sharp rise in profits, which it attributed partly to last year\u2019s launch of Signature Gold, an online site allowing investors to buy or sell part of the 400oz gold bars held in its vaults. The Mint said there had been a huge spike in demand after the Brexit vote. The gold price surged 25% rise to an average of $1,259.6 (\u00a3968.14) an ounce in the second quarter. The sharp rise put consumers off buying jewellery and other gold. China and India, the world\u2019s biggest gold consumers, saw jewellery purchases fall by 15% and 20% in the second quarter, to 144 tonnes and 98 tonnes respectively. In India, farmers \u2013 who account for two-thirds of the country\u2019s gold demand \u2013 are under pressure following a patchy monsoon and are buying less as a result. Government tax rises prompted widespread strikes of jewellers, which came to an end in April. The World Gold Council is predicting that the decline in global jewellery buying will be reversed in the second half of the year \u2013 similar to last year\u2019s pattern \u2013 when the Hindu festival Diwali and a return to confidence in China are expected to prompt more gold purchases. Buying by central banks fell by 40% in the second quarter but the price rise dramatically increased the value of gold they held, led by the US Federal Reserve, to $1.4tn globally.",
