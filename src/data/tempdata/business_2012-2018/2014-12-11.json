      "bodyText": "There was plenty to unsettle markets, from Russia\u2019s economic woes and its attempt to stop the rouble slide with a 1% rate rise to the Greek political crisis and the poor take-up of the European Central Bank\u2019s latest cheap loans to eurozone banks, writes Nick Fletcher. The ECB now seems set on a course of more radical measures, such as QE, but markets are not convinced president Mario Draghi has the support to push through his plans. Meanwhile, although the oil price has edged higher, it is still around five year lows. The UK market underperformed its European peers, weighed down as it is with commodity companies hit by the weak crude price. But there was some respite from the US, where positive retail sales figures saw Wall Street gain ground in early trading. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 38.34 points or 0.59% lower at 6461.70 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.64% to 9862.53 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.05% to 4225.86 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB slipped 0.09% to 19,201.07 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.34% higher at 10,431.8 In Greece, the Athens market lost another 7.35% to 827.98 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 214 points or 1.22%. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Bond expert Nick Spiro agrees that Russia\u2019s central bank has been playing an awful hand, thanks to events beyond its control. He writes: \u201cThe bottom line is that Russia is on the sharp end of the seemingly unending slide in oil prices, and there\u2019s very little the central bank can do to counter the fallout,\u201d \u201cRussia\u2019s monetary guardian is no longer a master of its own fate.\u201d Back to Russia.... this morning\u2019s interest rate hike has not strengthened the country\u2019s troubled currency. Instead, the rouble has suffered further big losses; it\u2019s down another 1.5% tonight at 55.7 roubles to one US dollar. It\u2019s the biggest rout in 16 years. The rate increase comes a week after President Vladimir Putin told the central bank and the government to take \u201charsh\u201d coordinated measures to deter speculators and steady the currency market, Bloomberg points out. Hiking interest rates by one percentage point to 10.5% sounds like a big move, but traders aren\u2019t impressed (as covered in the liveblog from here) And with the oil price near five-year lows, and inflation heading over 10% next year, it\u2019s hard to believe any rate move would have restored confidence in Russia. Further hikes in borrowing costs look likely, especially if inflation does keep climbing. And that could trigger an even deeper recession. Neil Shearing of Capital Economics says: The 100bp hike in Russian interest rates on Thursday was the minimum the central bank (CBR) had to deliver given the recent slide in the ruble. But this did little to stem the fall in the ruble, and the currency continued to weaken after the CBR\u2019s decision. With inflation set to rise further over the coming months, we think further rate hikes are likely in early 2015. The Russian stock market is also in the doldrums. The RTS index has just closed down 3.6%. One other development in Greece today, via Helena Smith: A judicial council, in a long-awaited decision, has this afternoon ordered Greece\u2019s former finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, to be tried by a Special Tribunal on charges of tampering with the infamous Lagarde list of wealthy Greeks (and suspected tax evaders) with hidden accounts held at the Geneva branch of HSBC. As regular readers will recall the socialist politician (since expelled from the Pasok party) stands accused of removing the names of relatives from the 2,000 plus list of names handed to Greek authorities by the French former finance minister Christine Lagarde. The trial must start within the next two months, with a judge being selected by lottery from the judiciary attached to the Supreme Court. It will be the first time in nearly 20 years that a politician is tried before a special tribunal in Greece. Greece\u2019s borrowing costs have moved further into danger zone territory too. The 10-year bond is now yielding 9.1% tonight, up from 8.7% last night. And the three-year bond yield has soared to 10.7%, up from 9.5%. That means investors are treating short-term Greek debt as riskier than long-term bonds, suggesting a bigger risk of default or restructuring in the next few years. Some news from Washington... the International Monetary Fund has said it will return to Athens next month for another assessment of its bailout programme: IMF SPOKESMAN SAYS GREECE INTENDS TO TREAT IMF LOAN PROGRAM AS PRECAUTIONARY IMF SPOKESMAN SAYS NEXT FUND MISSION WILL RETURN TO GREECE IN JANUARY Greece\u2019s stock market has just closed, with another jaw-dropping fall of over 7%. Many stocks have suffered double-digit declines; here\u2019s the biggest fallers: Investors are clearly ditching stocks before MPs hold their first vote to choose a new president, on December 17th. The big vote isn\u2019t until the 29th, when MPs have a third and final opportunity to approve the government\u2019s candidate, Stavros Dimas. Reject him three times, and a general election is triggered. And the Syriza party, which is demanding a debt restructuring, is the front-runner to seize power. That puts the Greek stock market on track for its biggest weekly fall in over two decades. Conservative MEP Dan Hannan tweets a graph showing the meltdown in the Greek stock market since Tuesday morning. The US stock market is shrugging off the losses in other parts of the world. The Dow Jones index is up around 1%, or 170 points, in early trading, recovering some of yesterday\u2019s 268-point tumble. Wall Street is cheering the latest retail sales figures, showing a 0.7% rise in November, up from 0.5% in October. That\u2019s the biggest monthly increase since March. Chris Williamson of Markit says: The upturn in sales supports survey evidence that the economy\u2019s recent growth surge is showing few signs of stalling, despite a gloomier-looking global economy. We expect, however, that the upturn is cooling compared to the heady rates of expansion seen in the summer. And the falling oil price means less pressure to raise interest rates. But for a real crash, check out the Middle East. The Dubai stock exchange tumbled over 7% today, in its biggest one-day drop since autumn 2009. That\u2019s a reaction to the drop in the oil price in recent days, which is likely to hurt economic growth in the region. The Greek stock market is plunging to new depths, after the prime minister issued dire warnings of chaos ahead if his party were ejected from power. And bond yields are surging, after Antonis Samaras told his MPs that Greece\u2019s membership of the eurozone could soon be at risk again. Samaras told members of his own New Democracy party that Greece risked locking itself out of the bond markets again if early elections are called next year, and the left-wing Syriza party wins. The Kathimerini newspaper has the details: Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras on Thursday accused opposition SYRIZA of bringing back Grexit fears and sending a message to the markets not to lend to the country by declaring its sovereign debt unsustainable. Speaking to New Democracy deputies on Thursday, Samaras said that former EU commissioner Stavros Dimas would be the presidential candidate for all three ballots in the upcoming election whose first round is scheduled to take place on December 17. \u201cSYRIZA is after power it cannot manage,\u201d Samaras told conservative MPs. The Greek premier added that there were those who were trying to cancel the country\u2019s success. \u201cDeputies have a duty to keep Greece in Europe,\u201d he said. I\u2019m not sure what effect Samaras was going for. But the impact has been immediate on the financial markets. Athens exchange has now tumbled by 7%, meaning it has shed 20% of its value since Samaras decided to accelerate the presidential election to next week. And bonds are plunging, pushing their interest rates higher into the danger zone. The 10-year Greek bond is now yielding over 9%, up from 8.7% last night. And the three year bond is now yielding more than 10%, as nervous investors demand a bigger premium for holding debt that matures sooner. Better news for the US -- the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell last week, to 294,000. Another sign that its economy is chugging along. Bad news for Russia, and other oil exporters... the cost of US crude oil is falling towards the $60 per barrel mark. It\u2019s down 0.75% today, to hit $60.48 just after 1pm GMT (or 8am EST): It\u2019s been a busy morning for central bankers, who are in the eye of the storm as the world economy ends 2014 on a low. The Central Bank of Russia, as expected, hiked interest rates again \u2013 to 10.5% from 9.5%. The bank also cut its economic growth forecasts over the next three years, and predicted that inflation could break through 10% early next year. The move did little to help the rouble, though, which has crashed through the 55-mark against the US dollar for the first time ever. Analysts say the 1% hike isn\u2019t enough to give the rouble a lift. Barclays has now chipped in, predicting another rate rise early next year: We expect a further 100bp hikes in Q1 15 bringing the key policy rate to 11.5%. And bank chief Elvira Nabiullina has warned that rates could be raised again if inflation isn\u2019t tamed. While Russia was hiking borrowing costs, the Norwegian central bank was cutting. The Norges Bank surprised the markets, and sent the Krone sliding, with a quarter-point rate cut to 1.25%. It warned that Norway\u2019s economy was suffering from the lower oil price, and the weak eurozone. The Swiss central bank was also active - leaving rates unchanged, but warning that the deflation risk was growing. And the Bank of England has embraced a new era of openness, with a plan to release the transcripts of its meetings (with an eight-year delay). The BoE also intends to cuts its meetings to eight per year, and release the minutes on the same day. Mark Carney signals Bank shakeup And most European markets are down the afternoon. Blame growth fears, the falling oil price, and the latest Greek political crisis. Newsflash from Moscow: RUSSIAN CENTRAL BANK\u2019S NABIULLINA SAYS BANK READY TO RAISE KEY RATE IF INFLATION RISKS GROW, LOWER RATE IF RISKS SUBSIDE Evgen Vorobiov, or the Polish Institute of International Affairs, says the Russian rate hike has raised fears over its economy: The financial markets are having another bad day, as a cocktail of bad news sweeps through the City. Greece is leading the selloff, with the main Athens index tumbling another 4% on fears that the government might call an early election. The weak oil price is also weighing on shares; Brent crude is hovering near a five-year today, at $65 per barrel. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, says oil is a worry: The oil-inspired selloff continues to dampen any pre-Christmas optimism, although opportunistic shorters are still keeping one eye on the oncoming \u2018Santa Rally\u2019 that is likely to kick off from next week. Concerns over global growth have knocked the mining sector, sending the FTSE 100 down 57 points at 6443. Beauchamp adds that this morning\u2019s corporate news brought little relief: Retailers have hit the headlines in London, as Sports Direct (down 2%) and SuperGroup (down 7% ) posted updates. The former did well, hitting all the right notes, and in the right order, as it reported continued expansion in Europe along with a rise in earnings. However, the latter\u2019s torrid year has seen no improvement thanks to the unseasonably warm weather of October. Our Datablog team have put the weakening Russian economy under the microscope. They show how the weakening rouble, tumbling oil prices and rising bond yields pose major challenges to Vladimir Putin, and Russian companies. Falling oil, rising cucumber prices: how much trouble is Russia in? It includes this chart, showing how the Russian central bank still has some firepower to prop up the rouble. Here\u2019s their conclusion When the Soviet Union collapsed, Putin was a KGB agent stationed in East Germany. He will have experienced the USSR\u2019s fall, and the regime change that followed, first hand. He will want to avoid a rerun. It may not be 1991 or 1998 all over again for Russia, but today\u2019s financial misfortune means that several of Putin\u2019s tools of economic control and influence will now be less sharp - and over time, if sustained, the political implications of this may come to matter just as much. Despite the president\u2019s necessary ramblings against the west during his latest state of the nation speech, there are already hints of greater caution and prudence. Maybe even concern. The financial markets are \u201cclearly disappointed\u201d that Russia\u2019s central bank didn\u2019t announce a large rate hike, says Andy Scott of foreign currency specialists HiFX. Scott predicts trouble ahead: \u201cRussia\u2019s economy looks in bad shape going into 2015 with the central bank predicting lower growth, whilst saying it would continue to raise interest rate if inflation risks strengthened \u2013 a toxic combination. Vladimir Putin might have stoked a nationalist spirit amongst Russians following the annexation of Crimea that has seen his approval ratings at an all-time high, but as inflation spirals upwards and if unemployment starts to rise, I suspect that the blame might be aimed at the West, but the anger directed at Mr Putin. A storm is definitely in the making, with the fall in the rouble just the beginning.\u201d The fall in the rouble\u2019s value since the rate hike is a blow to Moscow. Policymakers must must have hoped to see it strengthen and pull away from the 55-to-the-dollar mark, rather than hitting new record lows. So, if raising interest rates doesn\u2019t bring the rouble any relief, what can Moscow do? One option would be capital controls, limiting the amount of money that people can take out of banks and transport over the border. That would be a drastic step (we last saw them imposed in Cyprus in 2012, when it sought an IMF-EU bailout). But it could put a floor under the rouble. It is currently stuck in a vicious cycle where every fresh fall encourages people to switch roubles into harder currencies such as dollars and euros. The FT\u2019s Lex writer, Joseph Cotterill, reckons it\u2019s a plausible option. Last week, the Daily Telegraph quoted Lars Christensen of Danske Bank saying: \u201cWe know that voices close to president Vladimir Putin want capital controls, and we cannot rule this out.\u201d Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst at Caxton FX, fears that raising interest rates is \u201ctoo little too late\u201d to help the rouble: \u201cA combination of low oil and commodity prices has damaged the country\u2019s economic outlook, as the economy depends on oil and gas for 16% of the GDP, and the oil and gas sector makes up over 70% of the country\u2019s exports. Combine the poor outlook with economic sanctions from the west, and it is a recipe for disaster for the Russian currency.\u201d Our economics editor Larry Elliott says hiking Russian interest rates by one percentage point isn\u2019t enough to strengthen the rouble or fight inflation. Clearly the Russian central bank is worried that the impact of high borrowing costs on its \u201calready crumbling economy\u201d, he adds. Look how the rouble has weakened against the US dollar, hitting 55.22 roubles to the $1. The Russian central bank has also warned that inflation could exceed 10% in the first quarter of 2015. And it has also cut its growth forecasts for 2015-16 to almost zero. The rouble is hitting fresh record lows as the news of the 1% rate hike breaks. It just hit 55.12 against the US dollar, a drop of around 0.5% today. Looks like today\u2019s interest rate rise will not be enough to restore confidence in the Russian currency.... BREAKING: The Russian central bank has hiked the country\u2019s interest rates by a full percentage points. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation has just announced that borrowing costs will rise to 10.5%, up from 9.5%. The move is an attempt to prop up the rouble and peg inflation, in light of the recent tumble in oil prices. It\u2019s broadly in line with forecasts -- but some economists had warned that a bigger rate hike was necessary to really get to grips with the depreciating rouble (which hit a record low a little while ago). Reaction to follow.... Breaking: Eurozone banks have borrowed almost \u20ac130bn from the European Central Bank, through its offer of cheap loans. That\u2019s roughly in line with expectations, and is also short of the ECB\u2019s hopes when it announced the TLTRO plan last summer. The two phases of TLTRO have now pumped around \u20ac212bn of cheap credit into the banking sector, barely half the \u20ac400bn on offer. As explained in the introduction, a low TLTRO take-up raises the pressure on the European Central Bank to consider more unconventional measures to stimulate the euro economy. Here\u2019s some instant reaction from Finance twitter: George Osborne has welcomed the proposals to make the Bank of England more transparent by releasing minutes on the same day as a rate decision, and by releasing transcripts (rather than wiping them) after eight years. The Chancellor said: \u201cEnsuring the Bank is well positioned to fulfil its vital role of overseeing monetary policy and financial stability is a key part of the Government\u2019s long term economic plan. (is that *anything* that isn\u2019t part of the long term economic plan?) Osborne also indicates that he supports the idea of cutting MPC meetings from 12 to eight per year. Just in. The Bank of England is proposing cutting the number of interest rate-setting meetings to eight per year, down from 12, starting in 2016. It is also planning to publish the minutes of the meeting on the same day, from August 2015. And it will also embrace openness, by releasing the actual transcripts of its meetings, with an eight-year timelag. Currently, these transcripts are not ever released. (the BoE won\u2019t be totally open -- it is suggesting extending the MPC meetings to three days, with the first day firmly off the record). This follows a review by Kevin Warsh, a former US Federal Reserve governor. There\u2019s a press conference underway now, being streamed here. Parliament would have to approve cutting the number of MPC meetings, a move which would bring the Bank into line with the ECB and the Fed. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney says it is \u201cthe most significant set of changes to how we present and explain our interest rate decisions\u201d since the Bank got control of interest rates in 1997. The weakening rouble puts more pressure on the Russian central bank to act today with a rate rise. Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote, says the Bank must \u201cact decisively before the rouble deprecations truly gets out of control\u201d. \u201cAt today rate decision, we are looking for a conclusive 125bp hike to 10.75%. This will provide a clear message that policymakers have not completely abandoned control and provide temporary stability. However, a lack of action or even a marginal hike will clearly disappoint the market and accelerate the Ruble collapse.\u201d Reminder, we get the Russian interest rate decision in an hour\u2019s time.... The Russian rouble has just hit a new record low against the US dollar. The rouble slipped through the 55 roubles to the dollar mark for the first time ever, as Russia\u2019s top central bankers debate whether to raise borrowing costs. Reuters data shows that at 09:19 GMT the rouble was 0.28% weaker at 55.00 against the dollar, and 0.18% down at 68.37 against the euro. Norway\u2019s central bank has warned that the country\u2019s economy has weakened, as it outlines the reasons for the shock interest rate cut to 1.25% that just rattled the markets. The bank said that lower oil prices and the weak eurozone economy are hurting the Norwegian economy. It says: \u201cGrowth prospects for the Norwegian economy have weakened....Activity in the petroleum industry is softening and the sharp fall in oil prices is likely to amplify this tendency.\u201d \u201cThis will have spillover effects on the wider economy and unemployment may edge up ahead.\u201d The Norges Bank has also cut its growth forecasts. It now sees economic growth on the mainland (excluding the offshore oil and gas sector) of just 1.5% next year, below earlier forecasts for 2.25%. ....and the Norwegian Krone is sliding, hitting a five-year low of 9 Krone to the euro. The recent tumble in the oil price appears to have prompted the Norwegian central bank into today\u2019s rate cut. Norway has just cut interest rates, by a quarter of one percent to 1.25%. The first central bank decision of the day is in -- the Swiss National Bank has left interest rates unchanged at 0%, and reiterated that it will not allow the franc to appreciate above \u20ac1.20. There had been speculation that the Swiss might prepare a move towards negative rates today. The SNB warned that deflation risks have risen, and cut its inflation forecasts: Europe\u2019s main financial markets are pretty calm this morning. The FTSE,. German DAX and French CAC are all up around 0.3%. But shares in SuperGroup, the company behind fashion brand Superdry, fell 7% at one stage after posting a 30% drop in profits. It\u2019s a disappointing debut for its new chief executive, the former Co-op boss Euan Sutherland. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: The company, whose clothes are worn by David Beckham and Pixie Lott, has been hit by the unusually warm autumn weather which put shoppers off buying coats and knitwear. Underlying profits before tax fell to \u00a312.5m for the six months 25 October, from \u00a317.9m a year earlier. Overall revenues climbed 8.4% to \u00a3208m but like-for-like sales dropped 4.1%. Sutherland brushed off the impact of the mild autumn, and insisted that the company was \u201cwell prepared for the important peak season\u201d.... The rouble is calm in early trading, around 54.87 roubles to the US dollar . A year ago, before the Ukraine crisis erupted, one dollar was worth 32 roubles. The City\u2019s finest minds don\u2019t have a clue about how the Russian central bank will react to the deteriorating economy, weakening ruble and rising inflation: The Wall Street Journal has done a great job rounding up all the forecasts; showing a wide range of views. Here\u2019s a flavour: Luis Saenz, head of equity and derivative sales trading at BCS Financial Group: \u201cWe reckon the central bank will hike rates by 50 basis points Thursday. Will it help? I am not sure. They have done other hikes so far this year and they did not do much.\u201d Piotr Matys, rates strategist at Rabobank: \u201cI expect the Bank of Russia to raise its base rate to 12% from 9.5%. The ruble rout not only worsened the outlook for inflation, but more importantly poses a major threat to financial stability in Russia. Fairly aggressive interest rate hikes should prove a far more efficient tool to finally discourage speculators and stabilise the battered ruble rather than large scale FX interventions. Tatiana Orlova, Russia economist at RBS: \u201cMy base case is that the CBR will sit on its hands this time as they hiked by 150 basis points six weeks ago and the full impact of that hefty hike has not been fully realised. However I see an about 25% chance of another 50 basis point hike given that the fresh inflation numbers continue to exceed official forecasts. Business Insider has nailed it -- writing that \u201cRussia\u2019s Central Bank Is Meeting On Thursday \u2014 And It Only Has Terrible Options\u201d. They provide these charts, showing how Russian inflation has risen, despite a series of rate hikes earlier this year: BI\u2019s Myles Udland concludes: The Russian government has been defiant in the face of a declining ruble and an economy that appears headed towards recession in 2015. The official word out of Moscow has been that the declining value of the ruble, the increase in inflation, and the tumbling price of oil are all things Russia can overcome. And maybe they are. But on Thursday, Russia\u2019s central bank only seems to have bad options. And so here is Russia\u2019s problem: Damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. Today\u2019s Russian central bank rate decision is a \u201cthriller\u201d, say Fredrik Skoglund, analyst at SEB (Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken). Skoglund, who expects rates to go up by 100 basis points (1%), says the Bank is being pulled in two opposite directions. One the one hand, the bank is losing credibility that it is serious about fighting inflation and providing stability to the rouble precisely when it is moving to an inflation-targeting policy regime. On the other hand, a rate hike in the area of 250bp would further slow economic growth, which is already suffering from the deteriorating investment climate. If the CBR is \u201cserious about stabilising the ruble and reducing inflation\u201d, the hike should be larger than 100bp, he adds. On balance, economists polled by Bloomberg predict that the Russian central bank will raise interest rates by a full percentage point today, from 9.5% to 10.5%. But there\u2019s no real consensus. Nine analysts predict a bigger increase -- one even reckons we could see a 400 basis point move, to 13.5%! Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, eurozone and business. When faced with rising inflation and a sliding currency, central bankers usually reach for the rate-hike lever. And that\u2019s the picture facing the Central Bank of The Russian Federation today, when it holds its monthly monetary policy meeting. Russian interest rate are already at 9.5%, but they could easily be raised over 10% today in an attempt to prop up the rouble and prevent capital flight. But that would cause even more damage to an economy heading into recession, gripped by Ukrainian sanctions. So perhaps they won\u2019t raise rates...although that would presumably prompt another kicking for the rouble. The rouble has lost over 40% of its value against the US dollar since June. And Piotr Matys, currency strategist at Rabobank International in London, believes the Russian central bank must act. He told Bloomberg: \u201cThe worst ruble rout since the 1998 default implies that inflation will continue to rise in the coming months and also poses a major risk to Russia\u2019s financial stability,\u201d \u201cPreventing a full-scale financial crisis is far more important than avoiding recession.\u201d The decision comes at 1.30pm Moscow time, or 10.30am in the UK, followed by a press conference in Moscow. Also on the agenda..... French and German inflation data has just been released this morning, confirming that price pressures are weak. French inflation is up just 0.3% year-on-year, compared to 0.6% in Germany. The European Central Bank is making another attempt to stimulate the struggling eurozone economy, with a huge offer of fresh offer of cheap loans to eurozone banks. The TLTRO programme lets banks borrow at very low rates from the ECB, so long as they use the money to help the \u2018real economy\u2019 by lending it onto firms and consumer. But take-up could be disappointing; analysts predict that just \u20ac130bn of TLTRO cash will be taken up today, on top of the \u20ac82bn in the first round three months ago. That\u2019s barely half the \u20ac400bn offered by the ECB -- and could renew calls for fresh stimulus such as a government bond-buying programme. TLTRO, which trips off the tongue as \u201cTelltrow\u201d, stands for Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operation. We get the results at 10.15am GMT, I think. We\u2019ll be tracking events in Greece ahead of next week\u2019s presidential election. Stock markets are expected to continue falling again, as the weak oil price and the Greek crisis weights on sentiment. And in the corporate world, Sports Direct, Ocado, Whitbread, and SuperGroup are all reporting results.",

The company jumped 136p or 3% to \u00a345.65 after a positive response to its investor day on Wednesday. Analysts at Jefferies said: The R&amp;D day provided the first opportunity to meet a broad selection of senior management within Shire and we were impressed by clear strategic direction and rational development plans. We also gained visibility on Shire\u2019s early-stage research and technology platforms, as it highlighted its 22 product pipeline. We came away with the view that there is more value in the pipeline than is ascribed in the current $41bn valuation. Credit Suisse kept its neutral rating but raised its net present value on the business: Management kept the broad $10b revenue by 2020 made up of $7b from marketed and $3b from new drugs.

      "bodyText": "Legal &amp; General is leading the FTSE 100 after a positive note from Nomura and the results of a regulatory study into the annuity market. The Financial Conduct Authority proposed changes to the market, saying competition was not working to give customers the best deal. But with this year\u2019s Budget announcement that there should no longer be a requirement to buy an annuity, the FCA said people will get more choice, and its study found no widespread evidence of mis-selling. Meanwhile Nomura raised its rating on L&amp;G - up 3.9p at 245.2p - from neutral to buy, saying: L&amp;G was a relative early mover in focusing on cash, which was precipitated by the financial crises and a consequent cut in the dividend. Since 2009, L&amp;G has increased the dividend by 25% per annum. We believe L&amp;G is well placed to carry on this trend. We also believe the market is under-appreciating the strong operational momentum at the group. We believe L&amp;G\u2019s market-leading position in bulk annuities is a differentiator, where we see strong growth. Meanwhile, other segments should also see good growth such as protection and L&amp;G Capital, while Legal &amp; General Investment Management should remain stable. Nomura also recommended Direct Line, up 1p at 291p: We believe investors should have exposure to at least one UK non-life stock, given the sub-sector\u2019s high yield at a relatively lower PE. We continue to prefer Direct Line among the UK non-life names. Overall, with Russia raising interest rates to little effect on the rouble\u2019s slide and the European Central Bank reporting a low take up of its cheap loans to eurozone banks, leading shares have lost their early gains. The FTSE 100 is now down 41.26 points at 6458.78, despite the oil price - one of the factors dragging the market lower in recent days - making a slight revival. Brent crude is now up 1.2% at $65.",

      "body": "<p>A new study by the Grattan Institute on wealth across generations shows that the older Australians benefitted the most from the strong economic times of the early 2000s, and that by virtue of being effectively shut out of the housing market, members of \u201cGeneration Y\u201d may be the first generation to be less wealthy than that of their parents.</p> <p>Whenever younger generations are discussed in the media, invariably comments will be made that Generation Y are unemployable, lazy, spendthrifts who need to learn discipline if they want to get ahead. They\u2019re essentially the same comments that were made 20 years ago about Generation X and 15 or 20 years before that about the various incarnations of the baby boomer generation. Very little changes.</p> <p>But a new report by the Grattan Institute\u2019s, \u201c<a href=\"http://grattan.edu.au/report/the-wealth-of-generations/\">The Wealth of Generations</a>\u201d suggests that one aspect of Generation Y is different from previous ones \u2013 they are on track to have less wealth than the generation before them. </p> <p>The report makes it abundantly clear that the good economic times of the late 1990s and early 2000s were of benefit mostly to older Australians, and such people \u201care capturing a growing share of Australia\u2019s wealth, while the wealth of younger Australians has stagnated\u201d.</p> <p>In 2003-04, households whose main earner was under 34 accounted for 6.52% of all household wealth in Australia. By 2011-12 such households only accounted for 4.52%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/QLCge/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The biggest eaters of the wealth pie in that time were those over 55. They now hold 58% of all wealth, up from the 51% held by such households back in 2003-04.</p> <p>But it is not just in the share of the pie that the younger generations lost out, their wealth has also gone down in real terms. </p> <p>The Grattan Institute found that households across all age groups are wealthier now than their comparative aged households were in 2003-04. All that is except for those aged 25-34 years. </p> <p>The wealth of households aged 45-54 years old from 2003-04 to 2011-12 grew by $163,000 (in 2012 dollar terms) \u2013 a 23% increase. Those aged 55-64 saw their wealth in that time rise $174,000 (19%), while the wealth of 65-74 year old households rose a staggering $216,000, (27%). </p> <p>The households of 24 to 34-year-olds however lost $10,400 in wealth \u2013 a 4% drop:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/mjJkk/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"620\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So where did all this wealth for older households come from? </p> <p>The big factor was housing. </p> <p>Across all households housing accounts for around half of total net worth. And while, for example, households in the 55-64 year age bracket might hold on average $467,000 in housing assets, those in the 25-34 bracket hold just $183,000:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/CmMJR/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Not surprisingly, older aged households also hold more superannuation than younger ones.</p> <p>Had you taken a snapshot of the breakdown of the wealth by age bracket any time in the past 30 to 40 years, a similar picture would likely have emerged. Younger households generally will hold less wealth in housing because, as a general rule, your first home purchase is smaller than is the case when you age, gain more income and then \u201cupscale\u201d to a bigger home when you start a family. </p> <p>The problem is that is not what is happening now. </p> <p>Since 1981, roughly 70% of all Australian households have been homeowners. There has been a slight fall since the GFC and now the rate is around 68%. However, the big change has occurred in the age of homeowners. </p> <p>In 1981, 61% of 24-34 year olds owned a home, now it is just 48%. For 35 to 44-year-olds the drop is from 75% to 65%.

      "bodyText": "A new study by the Grattan Institute on wealth across generations shows that the older Australians benefitted the most from the strong economic times of the early 2000s, and that by virtue of being effectively shut out of the housing market, members of \u201cGeneration Y\u201d may be the first generation to be less wealthy than that of their parents. Whenever younger generations are discussed in the media, invariably comments will be made that Generation Y are unemployable, lazy, spendthrifts who need to learn discipline if they want to get ahead. They\u2019re essentially the same comments that were made 20 years ago about Generation X and 15 or 20 years before that about the various incarnations of the baby boomer generation. Very little changes. But a new report by the Grattan Institute\u2019s, \u201cThe Wealth of Generations\u201d suggests that one aspect of Generation Y is different from previous ones \u2013 they are on track to have less wealth than the generation before them. The report makes it abundantly clear that the good economic times of the late 1990s and early 2000s were of benefit mostly to older Australians, and such people \u201care capturing a growing share of Australia\u2019s wealth, while the wealth of younger Australians has stagnated\u201d. In 2003-04, households whose main earner was under 34 accounted for 6.52% of all household wealth in Australia. By 2011-12 such households only accounted for 4.52%: The biggest eaters of the wealth pie in that time were those over 55. They now hold 58% of all wealth, up from the 51% held by such households back in 2003-04. But it is not just in the share of the pie that the younger generations lost out, their wealth has also gone down in real terms. The Grattan Institute found that households across all age groups are wealthier now than their comparative aged households were in 2003-04. All that is except for those aged 25-34 years. The wealth of households aged 45-54 years old from 2003-04 to 2011-12 grew by $163,000 (in 2012 dollar terms) \u2013 a 23% increase. Those aged 55-64 saw their wealth in that time rise $174,000 (19%), while the wealth of 65-74 year old households rose a staggering $216,000, (27%). The households of 24 to 34-year-olds however lost $10,400 in wealth \u2013 a 4% drop: So where did all this wealth for older households come from? The big factor was housing. Across all households housing accounts for around half of total net worth. And while, for example, households in the 55-64 year age bracket might hold on average $467,000 in housing assets, those in the 25-34 bracket hold just $183,000: Not surprisingly, older aged households also hold more superannuation than younger ones. Had you taken a snapshot of the breakdown of the wealth by age bracket any time in the past 30 to 40 years, a similar picture would likely have emerged. Younger households generally will hold less wealth in housing because, as a general rule, your first home purchase is smaller than is the case when you age, gain more income and then \u201cupscale\u201d to a bigger home when you start a family. The problem is that is not what is happening now. Since 1981, roughly 70% of all Australian households have been homeowners. There has been a slight fall since the GFC and now the rate is around 68%. However, the big change has occurred in the age of homeowners. In 1981, 61% of 24-34 year olds owned a home, now it is just 48%. For 35 to 44-year-olds the drop is from 75% to 65%. By contrast in 1981, of those aged over 65, 78% owned a home \u2013 now it is 82%: The fall in home ownership rates since 1981 has not just been younger folk either, it is poorer households as well. Across all age groups the decline in home ownership is characterised by the biggest falls coming from the poorest of households, and across all income groups the drop off in homeownership also declines with age: The reason for the decline becomes clear when you look at the comparison of house prices and average income since 1970: From 1970 to 1997, the average full-time earnings grew at roughly the same pace as housing prices. But since then, while average earnings have grown by 27%, housing prices have grown in real terms by 121%. Given the lack of wealth younger people have to use as collateral for a loan, this has meant the amount of savings required to afford a deposit for a home loan has exploded well beyond what similar first home buyers needed 15, 25, or 40 years ago. This situation is further hampered by the fact that 20 to 24-year-olds on average have less pre-tax income than people did in the 1980s and 1990s: This in itself is a good thing as it actually means such people are staying longer in education, but it means it takes longer to build up savings and, thus again, makes it more difficult to raise a mortgage deposit. The increase in wealth has also come from government benefits. The mining boom, which brought large increases in revenue for the government, also saw a large increase in benefits and government spending \u2013 especially in health. Households of those aged 65 and over now receive around $8,500 extra a year in health benefits and $4,344 in cash benefits than similar households did in 1998. Once taxation changes are included, such households are now $12,689 better off a year from government benefits. By contrast, 25 to 34-year-old households are just $2,723 better off than such households in 1998. The mining boom and the rise in incomes it created spurred a housing and taxation revenue boom. It was a boom that benefitted those who already held the most wealth in Australia. The housing boom has without any doubt made it more difficult for Generation Y to buy a first home than any generation before them. Rather than a rising tide lifting all boats, the baby boomer generation massively improved its own wealth position while the younger generation have found themselves less wealthy than were their forebears, both in the share of the wealth pie, and in real dollar terms. Little wonder that they get a bit tetchy when they\u2019re told their generation is too lazy and just needs to save up and work hard like their parents did.",
