      "bodyText": "The release of the annual taxation statistics by the ATO offers a plethora of information about Australian workers that gives us an excellent snapshot of the nation. And the figures highlight that middle Australia earns much less than the government would have you believe and that women across all occupations continue to earn much less than men. As we get closer to the budget, the phrase \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d will be put on high rotation in politician\u2019s talking points. Last year the phrase was mostly used to justify the government raising the second highest income tax threshold from $80,000 to $87,000. Last year, Malcolm Turnbull said it showed the government was \u201cfocusing on ensuring that Australians, middle-income Australians, those that are on average full-time earnings, which, as you know is nudging $80,000, don\u2019t move into the second top tax bracket\u201d. And yet, the 2014-15 taxation statistics released last week revealed that the median taxable income of the 9.95m Australians with a taxable income was just $54,543. If you earned more than that, then you earned more than at least half of Australians. We always need to be a bit careful, however, before suggesting that is the median Australian income. Taxation statistics provide information on individuals, not households. If two adults living together with no children are both earning $54,543, they are most likely doing a lot better than half of Australian households. And the difficulty is that we need to talk about more than just average and median, we also need to talk gender. When Turnbull talks about average full-time earnings nudging $80,000, he is talking about men, not women. The current average total earnings for men working full-time is $89,221, for women full-time workers it is $72,212. But when we look at median earnings we see that these amounts are well above what half of Australia earns. While the median income for all workers in 2014-15 was $54,543, there is a big difference for the median men and women. Men overwhelmingly earn more than women: There are numerous reasons for this but the two key ones are that women are more likely to work part-time and are also more heavily employed in lower-paying occupations. It means that while the median income for all taxpayers was $54,543, the median for all women was just $47,125, while it was $61,711 for men. Either way, however, both are well below $80,000, let alone the new threshold of $87,000: Had you earned $80,000 in 2014-15 you would have earned more than 67% of men and 83% of women and 74% of all Australians \u2013 hardly in the middle: But while the figures do demonstrate the difference between the myth of what politicians would have us believe is middle Australia and the reality, the gap between the earnings of men and women is perhaps the most startling. Women made up 45% of all people earning a taxable income in 2014-15, and yet they accounted for just 25% of those in the richest 10% but 57% of those in the poorest decile: It goes without saying that if you earn a large income you are more likely to be a man and if you earn a small income you are most likely to be a woman \u2013 and it really does not matter what your job is. It is no shock to discover that, of the professional sportspeople, men are much better off. Nineteen per cent of the 9,600 sportsmen earned more than $80,000 in 2014-15, compared with just 2.7% of the 3,300 women earning a living playing sport: And it is perhaps also unsurprising to see the gender earnings divergence among CEOs and managing directors. In 2014-15 CEOs were the ninth-highest paying occupation by median income. But while 20% of male CEOs were in the top tax bracket, only 11% of women were: Women made up 27% of all CEOs but just 17% of those in the top tax bracket, and by contrast accounted for 36% of CEOs whose income was below $18,200. But it is somewhat more surprising to see the divide even among professions considered favourable to women. There are well over double the number of women working as HR professionals and yet 40% of the men earn over $80,000 compared with just 22% of women: Similarly there are almost the same number of female and male accountants and yet men once again are much more likely to earn six figures: Female journalists also suffer compared with their male counterparts, despite there being more women in the profession than men. Forty-one per cent of male journalists earned over $80,000 in 2014-15 compared with a mere 24% of female journalists: The breakdown of secondary school teachers incomes is instructive. The higher-income teachers are those with extra responsibility as well as seniority. And yet while women make up 62% of all secondary teachers, they account for just over half of those earning over $80,000. Of the nearly 88,000 women teaching in secondary schools, only 33% earn over $80,000 compared with 46% of the 54,000 male teachers. Such divergence can certainly be explained by greater numbers of women working part-time but in other professions the sense of gender bias appears rather stark. There are roughly the same number of male and female barristers in Australia \u2013 807 men, 847 women. And yet male barristers, by a massive amount, are situated in the highest tax bracket compared with women: Nearly two-thirds of female barristers earned less than $37,000 in 2014-15 compared with just over a quarter of their male counterparts. Is that really only because women choose to work less or in lower-paid areas of law? Or is it just possibly the well-known issues of the boys\u2019 club in the legal profession is reflected in the type of work and earnings female barristers achieve? But even among the low-paid occupations, such as sales assistants, women are more likely to be among the lowest-paid workers: Yes, a tendency toward greater part-time work is a reason. These figures don\u2019t suggest women are being paid less for the same level of work \u2013 but they do suggest women are not able to reach the same level of work that would see them earn higher incomes. And it occurs across every job. Sure, much of it is choice. But that choice is greatly influenced by social norms. As we saw last week when the ABS release the data on the \u201ctypical Australian\u201d, the typical Australian women does five to 14 hours of unpaid housework a week compared to the typical male, who does less than five. So long as women are expected to do more housework, more of the childcare (which as I have noted, occurs regardless of the employment status of either partner), women will struggle to earn an equal amount as men \u2013 regardless of which job they do. And of course this has real consequences. That income gap adds up \u2013 and it is most clearly seen in the difference in superannuation balances of men and women as they age: The median superannuation balance for a woman aged 55 to 59 is $40,000 less than a same aged man. That\u2019s fine if you happen to be married to such a man but it highlights that the sacrifice of staying at home results in a level of income dependence for women in retirement that most men don\u2019t have to worry about.",

Tosh. Do theatres book seats twice because sometimes people don\u2019t show up? Does London\u2019s Festival Hall sell 110% of its tickets? Airlines rely on selling more seats than they really have, just as they rely on many other devices to wring more money from passengers, because their business model is wrong. Flying costs more than the customer is charged. The \u201ccheap\u201d seat is misleading, and will become ever more so when airlines are forced to pay for the extraordinary damage they are doing to the environment, in terms of both air and noise pollution. Careless passengers? Oops, I forgot my flight from London to Malaga today. Maybe throwing away \u20ac150 or more is careless in Jenkins\u2019s world, but in mine it\u2019s not. Paul Griseri La Genetouze, France \u2022 Simon Jenkins on the United saga tells us we have only ourselves to blame for shoddy service from big business. He overlooks the simple fact that airlines would not suffer a surfeit of passengers if they could resist the temptation to sell seats twice. This does not happen at the sports stadium, theatre, concert or restaurant \u2013 all of which manage to make a profit regardless. The airlines are greedy.

It has since garnered more than 15m hits on YouTube, and the episode became a PR disaster for United. To its credit, the airline asked to use the video in customer-service training. It doesn\u2019t seem to have learned a great deal since then. Time, perhaps, for Carroll to compose a follow-up \u2013 \u201cUnited Breaks Your Face\u201d? Clifton Melvin Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire \u2022 Shouldn\u2019t someone have told United Airlines that the phrase \u201cbumping passengers off an overbooked flight\u201d wasn\u2019t meant to be taken literally (Asia seethes over footage of passenger manhandled off US plane, 13 April)?

      "bodyText": "The proposed merger between Tata Steel and the steel operations of Thyssenkrupp, which would secure the future of the Port Talbot steel works and a total of 8,000 UK jobs, is at risk because of complex negotiations around pensions and opposition from German trade unions. Talks between Tata Steel and German company Thyssenkrupp about combining their European steel operations have been ongoing for months but there are still major hurdles to overcome. Germany\u2019s largest trade union, IG Metall, confirmed this week it was opposed to the tie-up and described it as \u201chigh risk\u201d amid fears it would lead to thousands of job losses and the closure of plants in Germany. In the UK, the Pensions Regulator has warned about \u201csignificant issues\u201d to be resolved regarding the pension scheme behind Tata Steel, which is called the British Steel Pension Scheme. Earlier this year Tata Steel\u2019s UK workers voted in favour of proposals to rescue the business and 8,000 jobs, including about 4,000 at Port Talbot. Tata Steel UK has been under threat of closure since March 2016 when its Indian parent company revealed it was considering a sale, sparking a political crisis. However, under the turnaround plans Tata Steel will invest \u00a31bn in modernising its UK operations in return for replacing its final salary pension scheme with a less generous contribution scheme. But while Tata Steel has won the backing of workers to change their future retirement benefits it is still battling to find a solution for the existing liabilities in the British Steel Pension Scheme. The pension fund has 130,000 members and liabilities of \u00a315bn. Thyssenkrupp is reluctant to take on this burden so Tata Steel has been in talks with regulators about spinning it off or letting it enter the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), a government-backed pensions lifeboat funded by a levy paid by UK pension schemes. However, the pension scheme would be by far the largest ever taken on by the PPF. For the scheme to enter the fund, Tata Steel must persuade the regulator that it is on the brink of insolvency and cannot continue to support it. The Indian company is likely to have to pump hundreds of millions of cash into the scheme in order for the regulator to allow it to be offloaded. Workers will suffer a 10% cut to their benefits if the scheme enters the PPF. The Pensions Regulator said: \u201cWe continue to have discussions with the employer and the trustee about the future of the British Steel Pension Scheme. There are still significant issues to be resolved and we will consider any proposals carefully in light of their impact upon the 130,000 pension scheme members and PPF levy payers.\u201d The PPF added: \u201cDiscussions between all relevant parties on the future of the British Steel Pension Scheme are continuing. In the event that there is no future employer able to support the scheme, the Pension Protection Fund will work with all parties to find a solution that is in the best interest of our levy payers and the 11 million people who are protected by us, including the members of the British Steel scheme.\u201d If the proposed joint venture between Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp falls apart then Tata Steel will have to consider whether to press ahead with its turnaround plan for the business alone or seek a different deal. Tata Steel said: \u201cWe continue to be engaged in constructive discussions with Thyssenkrupp regarding a potential merger of the steel businesses of the respective companies in Europe. However, until a definitive agreement is reached, there can be no assurances these discussions will result in a transaction. \u201cMeanwhile, Tata Steel UK continues to be deeply engaged with the pension scheme trustee, the trade unions and relevant regulatory and government bodies to identify the best prospects for the future sustainability of its UK operations and a fair and practical outcome for the members of the British Steel Pension Scheme.\u201d",
