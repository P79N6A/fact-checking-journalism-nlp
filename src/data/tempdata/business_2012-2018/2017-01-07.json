Between 50 and 100 demonstrators led by the union United Voices of the World, which represents some of the west London store\u2019s waiters and kitchen staff, brought Brompton Road almost to a standstill on Saturday. The union has claimed in the past that Harrods\u2019s Qatari owner retains up to 75% of the service charge, a situation it says reduces the pay of its members by up to \u00a35,000 a year. An unspecified percentage of the service charge collected at Harrods\u2019s 16 cafes and restaurants is shared among kitchen and waiting staff, and the union is calling for a more transparent system. Petros Elia, the UVW general secretary, said Harrods had admitted to staff at a meeting on Friday that it took 50% of the service charge automatically added to bills. \u201cThey said that\u2019s going to change and the system was going to be more transparent for everyone,\u201d Elia said.

The software has proved controversial because a number of companies have allegedly used the restaurant management system to cream off money without customers or staff necessarily being aware. Elia said Harrods had now promised restaurant staff it would bring in an independent head of the tronc system and allow staff to sit on the committee operating it. The union said it was attracting a growing number of members within Harrods, and the promised changes showed that working together to demand change was working. The allocation of tips and service charges applied to bar and restaurant bills has become a hot topic, with a series of well-known chains found to be holding on to all or part of the money. A public consultation on measures to ensure staff get a bigger share of tips finished in the summer and responses are expected to be published by the business department early next year.

      "bodyText": "A reliable high street stalwart and City favourite for years, fashion chain Next rocked the City last week as it admitted to having had a gloomy Christmas, after a poor year, and warned of an even gloomier outlook for 2017. Traditionally the first major retailer to report on Christmas trading, Next has long been viewed as a bellwether for the high street and news of its poor performance dragged down the share prices of Marks &amp; Spencer and others. Even Next\u2019s ever-reliable winter sale \u2013 when eager customers queue up for its 5am Boxing Day opening \u2013 was a disappointment, with sales down 7% on last year. The company said store sales in the weeks before Christmas were down 3.5%, and profits for 2017-18 could come in a full \u00a3100m below market forecasts thanks to extra costs from rises in the minimum wage for over-25s, business rates and the new apprenticeship levy. The shares plunged 14% and are now changing hands at just over \u00a340 \u2013 valuing the chain at \u00a36bn \u2013 down from almost \u00a380 little more than 12 months ago. And even \u00a340 is too high for Next boss Lord Wolfson, it would seem. In recent years he has bought back shares worth hundreds of millions of pounds; now he has chosen instead to pay special dividends \u2013 a move that suggests he still doesn\u2019t think the shares are good value. Wolfson blamed the poor performance on unseasonal weather and a shift in consumer spending away from fashion in favour of eating out and holidays. It also forecast that fashion sales were likely to be squeezed further in 2017 as inflation leaves consumers with less money spare for non-essentials. But a number of analysts believe Next\u2019s problems are more fundamental, with some voicing fears that it is running into the problems that have beset Marks &amp; Spencer for years \u2013 ageing customers, dull ranges and a tired brand. Emily Stella of Verdict Retail said: \u201cNext\u2019s customer is ageing, and it is not attracting the people they think are their core customer \u2013 25-44-year-olds who are buying furniture and childrenswear as well as clothing. It really needs to improve its product and make something more relevant and inspirational for that demographic.\u201d Verdict\u2019s research indicates that less than half of Next\u2019s shoppers, 46%, are now in that key 25-44 age group, compared with 64% a decade ago. Younger shoppers have defected to competitors such as Zara, Ted Baker, Primark and online retailer Asos. \u201cIt could be going down the same route as M&amp;S, which is not where anyone wants to be going,\u201d said Stella. For years, the Next Directory online and catalogue business benefited from a combination of an attractive credit offer and slick delivery \u2013 both of which outclassed its rivals. \u201cDirectory has been driven by consumer credit rather than the desirability of the product,\u201d said veteran analyst Tony Shiret. \u201cNow credit has become more widely available.\u201d Shiret added that by focusing on credit, Next had failed to invest enough in keeping its online operations up to speed. Last Christmas, there was a dramatic shift towards buying via smartphones, and Next did not at the time have a specialist mobile site. Next\u2019s UK online sales rose just 1.4% in the year to 24 December \u2013 a poor performance compared with the 18% growth for online fashion in general last year, according to trade body IMRG. \u201cThere is clear evidence that in terms of an online offering, Next has been squeezed by new, more nimble entrants,\u201d said Clive Black of Shore Capital. He believes last year was the \u201capex of profit generation\u201d for Next and that erosion of earnings is likely to continue. Last week, Wolfson promised to spend \u00a310m in the coming year on improving its website and online marketing, but there are other problems. Fixing Next\u2019s fashion ranges may be trickier. Wolfson has admitted that all UK growth is coming from selling brands other than Next. The group\u2019s Label catalogue sells its own young fashion brand, Lipsy, alongside brands such as Calvin Klein, Nike, Whistles and Ted Baker, but those names are not stocked in Next\u2019s high street stores and that\u2019s where the real disappointment lay over Christmas. Partly of course, Next has the same issue as its great rival Marks &amp; Spencer in being a mature business with high market share \u2013 which means finding new converts is tough. It\u2019s a long time since Next has excited fashion editors, but that didn\u2019t stop it enjoying fairly consistent growth for years. However, 2014\u2019s loss of product director Christos Angelides after 28 years may have hit it harder than expected. The retailer is still generating big profits, and the cerebral Wolfson is by no means in panic mode. In recent years he has focused on larger department store-style locations and points to a downturn in Christmas shopper numbers in those shops of only 4%. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s a turning point,\u201d he says. But if the retailer can\u2019t revive shoppers\u2019 interest, closing stores, or downsizing, may have to move on to the agenda.",

      "bodyText": "Marisol Galarza floundered after finishing high school, but she eventually found her way to a job on an assembly line at a General Motors plant in the central Mexican state of San Lu\u00eds Potos\u00ed. Determined to get ahead, she started studying industrial engineering on Saturdays through a company-sponsored program and currently works in that department. \u201cI like what I do and I like what I\u2019m studying and what I\u2019m seeing there,\u201d said Galarza, 24. \u201cGod willing, I\u2019ll finish my studies this year.\u201d She had thought her future was secure here, in a state where more than 50,000 jobs depend on the car industry. But that future suddenly seems much less certain after a tumultuous week in which Mexico\u2019s automobile sector was thrown into disarray \u2013 and thousands of manufacturing jobs were threatened \u2013 by the US president-elect. In a string of tweets, Donald Trump chided car companies for operating in Mexico, apparently seeking to bully them into shifting production to the US. On Tuesday, Trump threatened to slap a \u201cbig border tax\u201d on General Motors for importing compact cars to the US market from Mexico. Hours later, Ford announced it had cancelled plans to build a $1.6bn plant in Villa de Reyes, saying that instead it would expand a facility in Michigan. Trump greeted the move as \u201cjust the beginning\u201d. Two days later, he turned his sights on Toyota, again threatening punitive taxes if the Japanese company continued with plans to open a new plant in Baja California. The company already has a facility in the Baja California city of Tijuana and is actually planning to open a facility in the central state of Guanajuato. Ford has insisted that its change of plans had nothing to do with Trump, but that has done little to change the perception that \u2013 even before he takes office \u2013 Trump is wreaking havoc with an industry which until now had been booming for twenty years. \u201cThere\u2019s real worry over what happened with Ford,\u201d said Galarza. \u201cIt could be that one day you\u2019re fired and they say the plant is going to close.\u201d The looming Trump administration has already sent the Mexican peso plunging to record lows and threatens to unravel commercial ties so close that more than $1m of merchandise crosses the Mexico-US border every minute. Throughout the election campaign, Trump trashed Mexico mercilessly, and on Friday, the president-elect repeated his pledge to wall off the border, saying Mexico would repay the construction costs \u201clater\u201d. His threats could not have come at a worse time for Mexico as the country confronts stalling economic growth and a spate of violent protests over an increase in the government-set gasoline price. \u201cTo @realDonaldTrump : The more jobs you destroy in M\u00e9xico, the more immigrants the American people will have. Think a little!\u201d ex-president Felipe Calder\u00f3n wrote in Twitter. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has appealed for national unity, but his government has struggled for a coherent response to the many challenges it faces. On Wednesday, he named a former finance minister who arranged Trump\u2019s humiliating pre-election visit to Mexico as the country\u2019s new foreign minister \u2013 prompting speculation that the president is pinning his hopes on forging a close relationship with Trump\u2019s inner circle. Meanwhile, economists and Mexican politicians have warned that Trump\u2019s tantrums portend further economic problems as companies shy away from the public shaming that could come with investment in the country. Federico Est\u00e9vez, a political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, said that danger for Mexico was not a potential trade war, but the chilling effect Trump\u2019s words would have on foreign investment. \u201cThey\u2019ll be careful about their capital expansion programs in a place like Mexico because Trump will jawbone them \u2013 not in private: in public,\u201d he said. Much of the foreign direct investment in Mexico has gone to the car industry, which took hold in states such as San Luis Potos\u00ed and sent GDP growth in the region soaring above 5% per year. The industry\u2019s roots in Mexico date back over decades \u2013 for years Volkswagen produced the Beetle in the state of Puebla \u2013 but the sector has grown steadily since the 1980s, to the point that most of the world\u2019s major automakers have opened plants in the country. \u201cOne of the main advantages automakers have in Mexico is high productivity and low wages in these plants. That\u2019s attractive,\u201d said Harley Shaiken, a geography professor at the University of California at Berkley, who studies the Mexican auto industry. An average car factory worker in Mexico earns around $8 an hour, compared to the $60 an hour that Ford spends on a US employee, including pay and benefits. \u201cYou have mega transnational companies that are able to earn a lot of their investment in Mexico, in part because productivity is high and wages are depressed.\u201d Officials in San Luis Potos\u00ed recite a litany of other advantages which fall to companies that relocate to their region: Mexico has free trade deals with more than 40 countries, major highways and railway lines crisscrossing the region and a location in the geographic heart of Mexico, roughly halfway between Mexico City and the Texas border. Left unmentioned are incentives from state and national governments, such as a 10-year payroll tax holiday and 60 hectares of land which were given to Ford \u2013 the price of which will be returned, the state government says. BMW collected incentives worth more than 3.5 billion pesos ($160m) to build in San Luis Potos\u00ed, the newsweekly Proceso reported. Critics say that such deals also include arrangements to curb the influence of unions. One arrangement allows companies to strike an agreement with a union \u2013 often aligned with the political party in power \u2013 prior to hiring any employees, rather than the employees forming a union selecting their representation. \u201cAll workers that enter the firm have to belong to that union,\u201d said Guillermo Lu\u00e9vano Bustamante, a professor at the Autonomous University of San Luis Potos\u00ed. Local officials chafe at suggestions that the abundance of low-paying jobs has any downside. \u201cIt\u2019s been a total transformation,\u201d said Arturo Berm\u00fadez, town treasurer in Villa de Reyes, a municipality where people once survived on subsistence agriculture coaxing corn and beans out of the harsh desert landscape. Before the car plants opened, \u201cmaybe 5% of people had a car\u201d, he said. \u201cNow, only 5% don\u2019t have a car.\u201d But not everyone expresses such enthusiasm \u2013 especially as the plunging peso has reduced purchasing power. \u201cThey\u2019re paying the bare minimum, which, for me, is misery,\u201d said Salvador Mart\u00ednez, a long-haul trucker in Villa de Reyes \u2013 where most jobs depend on the auto industry either directly or indirectly. \u201cGasoline, tortillas, everything increasingly costs more. Everything goes up except salaries.\u201d And in Villa de Reyes, anger with Trump often appears to be tempered by discontent with Mexico\u2019s politicians. Much of that anger is focused on Pe\u00f1a Nieto himself, who has the lowest approval ratings of any Mexican president in over two decades and has been been at the centre of string of conflict of interest scandals and pushed through economic reforms popular with foreign investors but unpopular at home. \u201cDonald Trump is one thing, but it\u2019s another when your own president is screwing the country,\u201d said Jorge de la Cruz, a mechanic.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u201cI like the car I\u2019m in now. It\u2019s a Chevrolet Suburban. Made in the USA,\u201d Donald Trump told the Detroit News last year when the then presidential hopeful was asked to name his favorite car from his 100-plus vehicle fleet that includes a scissor-door Lamborghini Diablo and a 1956 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud. For General Motors, Chevy\u2019s owner, it was nice PR, the latest in a series of endorsements from the Trumps that reach back like a stretch limo to the Cadillac Trump\u2019s landlord father Fred used to pick up his rent checks. In the 1980s Donald Trump even worked on building a Trump-branded Cadillac, complete with VCR and paper shredder. The Trumps may be fans of the US\u2019s largest car manufacturer but GM, and the car industry in general, should have been paying more attention to the final sentence of his pre-election endorsement: \u201cMade in the USA.\u201d Trump hit out at the car industry last week like a drive-by shooter, firing off a series of angry tweets about their outsourcing of US jobs. Those tweets will be the hottest topic this week as Detroit\u2019s annual car jamboree, the North American International Auto Show, gets started. It\u2019s a chance for the industry to show off all its latest products and for its executives to address the media about the future. Trump\u2019s blimp-like shadow is overhanging the event as executives and analysts fret about how this overtly interventionist president will use the bully pulpit of his office, and his Twitter account, to try and force a radical change in the way they do business. \u201cPretty much everybody is dreading being the subject of a tweet. Getting hauled out into the court of public opinion with virtually no warning is not something anybody wants to get engaged with,\u201d said Kristin Dziczek, director of the industry, labor and economics group at the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research (CAR). The auto industry matters to the US and to Trump. Six years after a recession that almost destroyed it, the US car industry has made a miraculous recovery. Last week it reported record sales for 2016. Auto manufacturers, suppliers and dealers employ over 1.5 million people and directly contribute to the creation of another 5.7m jobs, according to the CAR. Trump won thanks in large part to states where the auto industry is strongest. The Republican candidate took Michigan, home to the auto show and still the industry\u2019s hub, from the Democrats for the first time since 1988 with a campaign that tore into companies that have sent those voters\u2019 jobs abroad, especially to Mexico. Ford bore the brunt of Trump\u2019s attacks during the election. Last week it was GM\u2019s turn. Then Toyota\u2019s. \u201cGeneral Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax!\u201d the president elect warned via his favorite megaphone, Twitter. Two days later, he was after Toyota. \u201cToyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for US. NO WAY! Build plant in US or pay big border tax,\u201d he tweeted. Toyota\u2019s plans were old news but the tweet came on the same day that its president, Akio Toyoda, had told reporters he was keen to work with the president-elect. These were the latest in a series of attacks on major US employers, including Carrier, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, that have so far brought CEOs running, cap in hand, to Trump Tower to make up for their alleged corporate misdeeds. Shortly after the GM tweet, Ford announced it had canned plans to open a $1.6bn plant in Mexico and would add new jobs building electric and hybrid vehicles at a plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. Trump hailed the move: \u201cThank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the US. This is just the beginning \u2013 much more to follow,\u201d he tweeted. Matt DeLorenzo, managing editor for Kelley Blue Book, said Trump was \u201cplaying to his base and a lot of the voters who put him in office were industrial midwest, blue collar, union workers. All his tweets and pronouncements have been geared to addressing that audience,\u201d said Matt DeLorenzo, managing editor for Kelley Blue Book. Ford had already warned that the car industry was expecting a slowdown in sales, especially of smaller vehicles like the ones that would have been built in Mexico. So scrapping the plan makes economic as well as political sense for the company, but market watchers doubt the industry and Trump\u2019s agendas will remain compatible. GM is expected to start laying off more than 3,000 factory workers in Michigan and Ohio, another state that voted for Trump, starting later this month. Will they defend that decision if Trump goes on the attack? The car industry is truly international and China is its largest market. GM and its joint venture partners sold 3.87m vehicles in China in 2016, up 7.1% from the previous year. China accounts for a third of GM\u2019s sales. Like its corporate peers, GM has \u2013 so far \u2013 remained silent over Trump\u2019s anti-China rhetoric, but a trade war would be a disaster for the company. Some wonder if Trump will really translate tough talk into policy. \u201cThere is always a difference between campaigning and governing and we have not yet seen what governing looks like,\u201d said Dziczek. Others are more concerned. Trump is in a honeymoon period because \u201cthere is nobody speaking out\u201d, said Daniel Ikenson, director of the Herbert A Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute. Republicans have remained silent as he has attacked businesses they once defended and the business community has even gone out of its way to endorse Trump cabinet picks that have overt protectionist views, he said. The incoming president has clearly signalled that Obama\u2019s trade-friendly, internationalist era is over, said Ikenson. The US steel industry lawyer Robert Lighthizer is Trump\u2019s choice for United States trade representative, the anti-China economist Peter Navarro is set to head the newly created National Trade Council at the White House and the billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, a staunch critic of the US\u2019s existing trade agreements, is Trump\u2019s pick to lead the commerce department. \u201cThese are people who if you mentioned them a few months ago, businesspeople would shudder. Now: \u2018Hey, great idea, we like the enforcement mentality.\u2019 They are scared. To me, this is extremely disconcerting and dangerous. This silence of people who should be speaking out is reminiscent of the 1930s. The stakes might be different but the it\u2019s a similar sort of thing,\u201d Ikenson said. So far, corporate reaction to Trump\u2019s election has been bland; business leaders like that he\u2019s is \u201cpro-growth\u201d and wants to cut red tape. But that may change once Trump is in office. The president may also find that changing the industry is harder than he thinks. The auto industry is a global supplier with a global supply chain. While it\u2019s politically easy to target US neighbours like Mexico for \u201ctaking American jobs\u201d, the real picture is more nuanced than anything you could fit into a 140-character tweet. Forty per cent of the parts that make up the average vehicle imported to the US from Mexico were made in the US. \u201cWe are sending them parts, engines, transmissions that then come back to us as vehicles that have been assembled,\u201d said Dziczek. Imposing duties on foreign imports makes about as much sense as \u201cbuilding a concrete wall in the middle of what used to be Ford\u2019s Dearborn plant\u201d, said Ikenson. \u201cThe factory floor spans borders and oceans now. Imposing tariffs like this is like separating the chassis line from the engine line.\u201d CAR is predicting Mexican auto assembly capacity will more than double in size between 2010 and 2020, thanks in part to lower labour costs but also to Mexico\u2019s free trade agreements with 40 countries that give it access to 47% of the world\u2019s automotive market. In the next five years, CAR predicts, most Mexican car exports will go to countries outside the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which Trump has attacked for taking US jobs. Dziczek doubts one man, even the US president, can hold back those forces. \u201cYou put a plant in place for 30 or 40 years. You don\u2019t worry about four to eight years. Plants last a lot longer than presidents,\u201d she said. As Trump prepares to take office, Ikenson said he worried that autoworkers and other voters who backed Trump in part as a protest against the impact of decades of free trade may not like what they get. If trade agreements are scrapped and imports imposed on foreign goods, \u201cthey will be the first wave of casualties. We went from 19m workers in manufacturing in 1979 to about 12m today. That goes down to 10m workers,\u201d he predicted. But Trump and Trump\u2019s voters have heard this argument before and they aren\u2019t buying it. On the crowded floor of Detroit\u2019s Cobo Center this week, and in the suites and conference rooms of its hotels, the car industry\u2019s biggest brains will all be working overtime trying to figure out how to deal with the man their workers elected.",

In the 1980s Donald Trump even worked on building a Trump-branded Cadillac, complete with VCR and paper shredder. The Trumps may be fans of the US\u2019s largest car manufacturer but GM, and the car industry in general, should have been paying more attention to the final sentence of his pre-election endorsement: \u201cMade in the USA.\u201d</p> <p>Trump hit out at the car industry last week like a drive-by shooter, firing off a series of angry tweets about their outsourcing of US jobs. Those tweets will be the hottest topic this week as Detroit\u2019s annual car jamboree, the North American International Auto Show, gets started. It\u2019s a chance for the industry to show off all its latest products and for its executives to address the media about the future. Trump\u2019s blimp-like shadow is overhanging the event as executives and analysts fret about how this overtly interventionist president will use the bully pulpit of his office, and his Twitter account, to try and force a radical change in the way they do business.</p> <p>\u201cPretty much everybody is dreading being the subject of a tweet. Getting hauled out into the court of public opinion with virtually no warning is not something anybody wants to get engaged with,\u201d said Kristin Dziczek, director of the industry, labor and economics group at the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research (CAR).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de85b4485656879e95d7d12b2fae2604de010ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de85b4485656879e95d7d12b2fae2604de010ae3/0_68_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside Donald Trump\u2019s 1988 Cadillac: the \u2018best limo in the world\u2019 had rosewood interiors and was equipped with a fax machine, TV, VCR, paper shredder and a built-in safe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside Donald Trump\u2019s 1988 Cadillac: the \u2018best limo in the world\u2019 had rosewood interiors and was equipped with a fax machine, TV, VCR, paper shredder and built-in safe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jules Annan / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The auto industry matters to the US and to Trump. Six years after a recession that almost destroyed it, the US car industry has made a miraculous recovery. Last week it reported record sales for 2016. Auto manufacturers, suppliers and dealers employ over 1.5 million people and directly contribute to the creation of another 5.7m jobs, according to the CAR.<br></p> <p>Trump won thanks in large part to states where the auto industry is strongest. The Republican candidate took Michigan, home to the auto show and still the industry\u2019s hub, from the Democrats for the first time since 1988 with a campaign that tore into companies that have sent those voters\u2019 jobs abroad, especially to Mexico. Ford bore the brunt of Trump\u2019s attacks during the election. Last week it was GM\u2019s turn. Then Toyota\u2019s.<br></p> <p>\u201cGeneral Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax!\u201d the president elect warned via his favorite megaphone, Twitter.<br></p> <p>Two days later, he was after Toyota. \u201cToyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for US. NO WAY! Build plant in US or pay big border tax,\u201d he tweeted. Toyota\u2019s plans were old news but the tweet came on the same day that its president, Akio Toyoda, had <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/toyota-president-strikes-friendly-tone-on-trump-1483637844\">told reporters</a> he was keen to work with the president-elect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2017/01/auto-employment-map/\" data-alt=\"Auto industry jobs across the US.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2017/01/auto-employment-map/\">Auto industry jobs across the US.</a> </figure>  <p>These were the latest in a series of attacks on major US employers, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/03/donald-trump-carrier-factory-indiana-jobs-tax-breaks\">Carrier, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/06/trump-boeing-air-force-one-cost\">Boeing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/23/lockheed-f-35-fighter-project-in-doubt-after-trump-tweet-encourages-rival-boeing\">Lockheed Martin</a>, that have so far brought CEOs running, cap in hand, to Trump Tower to make up for their alleged corporate misdeeds. Shortly after the GM tweet, Ford announced it had canned plans to open a $1.6bn plant in Mexico and would add new jobs building electric and hybrid vehicles at a plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. Trump hailed the move: \u201cThank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the US. This is just the beginning \u2013 much more to follow,\u201d he tweeted.</p> <p>Matt DeLorenzo, managing editor for Kelley Blue Book, said Trump was \u201cplaying to his base and a lot of the voters who put him in office were industrial midwest, blue collar, union workers. All his tweets and pronouncements have been geared to addressing that audience,\u201d said Matt DeLorenzo, managing editor for Kelley Blue Book.<br></p> <p>Ford had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/14/ford-steep-decline-financial-performance-2017\">already warned</a> that the car industry was expecting a slowdown in sales, especially of smaller vehicles like the ones that would have been built in Mexico. So scrapping the plan makes economic as well as political sense for the company, but market watchers doubt the industry and Trump\u2019s agendas will remain compatible.<br></p> <p>GM is expected to start laying off more than 3,000 factory workers in Michigan and Ohio, another state that voted for Trump, starting later this month. Will they defend that decision if Trump goes on the attack?<br></p> <p>The car industry is truly international and China is its largest market. GM and its joint venture partners sold 3.87m vehicles in China in 2016, up 7.1% from the previous year. China accounts for a third of GM\u2019s sales. Like its corporate peers, GM has \u2013 so far \u2013 remained silent over Trump\u2019s anti-China rhetoric, but a trade war would be a disaster for the company. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/10/first-actions-trump-president-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b99d\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2880535\"            data-video-name=\"What will be the first actions Trump takes as president? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"the guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5824e8b1e4b05c05c52f393f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/10/161109TRUMP_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/10/161109TRUMP.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/10/161109TRUMP_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/10/first-actions-trump-president-video\">What will be the first actions Trump takes as president?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Some wonder if Trump will really translate tough talk into policy. \u201cThere is always a difference between campaigning and governing and we have not yet seen what governing looks like,\u201d said Dziczek. Others are more concerned. Trump is in a honeymoon period because \u201cthere is nobody speaking out\u201d, said Daniel Ikenson, director of the Herbert A Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute. Republicans have remained silent as he has attacked businesses they once defended and the business community has even gone out of its way to endorse Trump cabinet picks that have overt protectionist views, he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/07/fear-and-threats-mexico-hits-back-over-trumps-bullying-of-automakers\">'Fear and threats': Mexico hits back after Trump pressures automakers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The incoming president has clearly signalled that Obama\u2019s trade-friendly, <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/lighthizer-completes-trumps-protectionist-triumvirate\">internationalist era is over</a>, said Ikenson. The US steel industry lawyer Robert Lighthizer is Trump\u2019s choice for United States trade representative, the anti-China economist Peter Navarro is set to head the newly created National Trade Council at the White House and the billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, a staunch critic of the US\u2019s existing trade agreements, is Trump\u2019s pick to lead the commerce department.<br></p> <p>\u201cThese are people who if you mentioned them a few months ago, businesspeople would shudder. Now: \u2018Hey, great idea, we like the enforcement mentality.\u2019 They are scared. To me, this is extremely disconcerting and dangerous. This silence of people who should be speaking out is reminiscent of the 1930s. The stakes might be different but the it\u2019s a similar sort of thing,\u201d Ikenson said.<br></p> <p>So far, corporate reaction to Trump\u2019s election has been bland; business leaders like that he\u2019s is \u201cpro-growth\u201d and wants to cut red tape. But that may change once Trump is in office. The president may also find that changing the industry is harder than he thinks. </p> <p>The auto industry is a global supplier with a global supply chain. While it\u2019s politically easy to target US neighbours like Mexico for \u201ctaking American jobs\u201d, the real picture is more nuanced than anything you could fit into a 140-character tweet. </p> <p>Forty per cent of the parts that make up the average vehicle imported to the US from Mexico were made in the US. \u201cWe are sending them parts, engines, transmissions that then come back to us as vehicles that have been assembled,\u201d said Dziczek. <br></p> <p>Imposing duties on foreign imports makes about as much sense as \u201cbuilding a concrete wall in the middle of what used to be Ford\u2019s Dearborn plant\u201d, said Ikenson. \u201cThe factory floor spans borders and oceans now. Imposing tariffs like this is like separating the chassis line from the engine line.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2017/01/mexican-auto-production/\" data-alt=\"Mexico\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2017/01/mexican-auto-production/\">Mexico</a> </figure>  <p>CAR is predicting Mexican auto assembly capacity will more than double in size between 2010 and 2020, thanks in part to lower labour costs but also to Mexico\u2019s free trade agreements with 40 countries that give it access to 47% of the world\u2019s automotive market. In the next five years, CAR predicts, most Mexican car exports will go to countries outside the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which Trump has attacked for taking US jobs.
