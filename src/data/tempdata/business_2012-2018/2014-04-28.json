He has also suggested we need to increase people\u2019s incentives to work. However, the solutions to these two problems actually conflict because tighter means testing can actually decrease people\u2019s willingness to work, because the more you earn the less you receive from the government. Australia, as I noted a couple weeks ago, already has arguably the most targeted means testing in the world. This was further highlighted by the preliminary release of the OECD\u2019s 2014 Taxing Wages report, which noted that Australia has one of the most progressive income taxation systems globally. But the main reason it is so progressive is not because our tax rates increase sharply with our income but because, as the OECD noted, as our income increases there is a sharp \u201cwithdrawal of the generous benefits (e.g. in relation to children and/ or in-work benefits)\u201d. This is revealed by looking at the \u201ctax wedge\u201d across the OECD for couples with children. Tax wedges in essence measure the tax burden, as they take into account not just the taxes and social security payments paid by employees, but also the benefits received from the government. On this score we can see how the tax burden in Australia significantly increases for a couple with two children as the second partner earns more money. The tax wedge for a couple with only one partner earning the average wage is 16.9%; when the second partner earns 67% of the average wage as well, the tax wedge rises to 25.2%, one of the biggest jumps among the OECD. And this brings us to the problem of Hockey wanting to tighten the means testing and also increase people\u2019s incentive to work. The OECD notes that the highly progressive tax systems in countries like Australia \u201chave to be designed with care in order to prevent too large work disincentives\u201d. This is because tightening the means testing of welfare actually increases the disincentive to work. To understand why, we need to think about the effective marginal tax rates we pay at certain incomes. Effective marginal tax rates calculate not just the extra income tax you pay by earning an extra dollar, but also the amount of welfare you lose. For example, the Family Tax Benefit A base payment for one child under 13 is $4,489.50 a year. But it is reduced by 20 cents for every dollar that the combined income of the parents goes over $48,837. This means the effective marginal tax rate they pay increases once they earn more than $48,837. In essence, earning under $48,837 means they only have to pay income tax. Earning over it means they pay income tax and also lose welfare payments. As Canberra blogger David Plunkett shows with some excellent effective marginal tax rate graphs on his blog, there are a number of situations where for people on Newstart or other benefits, where you are actually better off not earning any more money because while you might earn more money, you will lose a greater amount in welfare payment reductions. And this is where the problem for the government arises. If Hockey, for example, wanted to reduce the number of people receiving Family Tax Benefit A, he could do it by reducing the base payment of $4,489.50. At this amount and with the 20 cents per dollar reduction rate, the maximum you can earn and still get this payment is $64,350. But if the base amount was reduced to (for example) $3,500 it would cut out much earlier \u2013 at around $59,000. But that would mean everyone on the payment would now get less money, not just the higher income earners. Hockey could instead tighten the payment by increasing the rate at which it is reduced \u2013 say to make it reduce by 30 cents for every dollar you earn over $48,387. This would again reduce the maximum income threshold, while still seeing the poorest getting the same amount, but it would also reduce people\u2019s incentive to work. Whereas before, earning over $48,837 saw you only lose 20 cents of welfare per extra dollar of income, now it would be 30 cents \u2013 meaning your incentive to work is reduced because you end up getting less money than you did before from doing the same amount of work. The government is currently spending a lot of time worrying about whether the right people are getting welfare, and also about people being encouraged to work. Given our welfare system is already among the most targeted in the world, perhaps they should be less concerned about whether the right people are getting welfare, and more concerned about whether the right people are getting enough.",

The company, which has been hit by a series of scandals including charging the government for electronically tagging prisoners who had died or were back behind bars, warned investors that its profits will fall far short of expectations and it needs an urgent injection of cash.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is preparing to order eight of the UK's biggest banks and building societies to ensure they are strong enough to withstand sharp drops in house prices and sudden rises in interest rates. Before the formal publication of the tests, Sky News said banks would be required to show they could survive a 35% fall in house prices and interest rates jumping to 5%, after five years at a record low of 0.5%. The conditions that banks must be able to withstand are to be outlined by the Bank of England on Tuesday. The so-called stress tests are to be conducted by the Bank's Prudential Regulation Authority. Seven banks \u2013 the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, as well as Barclays, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Co-operative and the UK arm of Spain's Santander \u2013 are to be subjected to the Bank of England's tests, along with Nationwide building society. The tests are being announced as the EU's banking regulator prepares to outline details of its co-ordinated programme to make the financial system across the EU resilient enough to withstand market turmoil, with a sample of about 124 banks to be included. Only four UK banks \u2013 Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS \u2013 will be part of the EU's examination. The scenarios being drawn up will not be forecasts by the Bank but are intended to demonstrate that the institutions are being subjected to severe tests. \"The government created the new regulatory system in order to build a resilient economy and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. Building strong and resilient banks is a core part of our long-term economic plan,\" the Treasury said. The tests take place at a time when much focus is being placed on rising house prices amid warnings of a London \"superbubble\", with price rises rippling outwards across the country. In February, house prices in the capital soared almost 18% on a year earlier to an average of \u00a3458,000, according to the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics. It also reports house price growth picking up steam across most parts of the UK, adding to fears that a bubble could spread. That has chimed with anecdotal evidence from estate agents and surveyors in recent months that the surge in activity and prices has started to spread beyond the south-east, buoyed by growing confidence in the economy and government initiatives to support buyers with small deposits. For the UK as a whole, house prices were up 9.1% in February, the fastest annual inflation for more than three and a half years. As of the weekend, new tests are being conducted on would-be borrowers to ensure they have enough cash to repay mortgages at current rates, as well as at a higher rate of 7%. Banking stress tests have been in focus since the 2008 crisis when banks across Europe were found to have run short of resources to withstand losses on loans and changes in the way they could raise finance on the money markets. But early tests were discovered to be too lenient after Ireland's banks, for instance, were given a clean bill of health just before they ran out of capital. The tests are expected to cover three years to 2016, and the European Banking Authority, which is overseeing the tests, is allowing local regulators \u2013 such as the Bank of England \u2013 to make their tests tougher. Last year the Bank of England announced its intention was to conduct annual stress tests of all the major banks and subsidiaries after a consultation with the industry. A year ago, policymakers at the Bank of England warned banks needed to find \u00a325bn of extra capital to cover bad loans and mis-selling claims. The US already conducts such tests and on Monday one of the country's biggest banks \u2013 Bank of America \u2013 was forced to retake its tests with the Federal Reserve after uncovering a banking error that dated back to 2007. As a result, Bank of America, which bought Merrill Lynch as Lehman Brothers was collapsing in 2008, has been forced to suspend its plans to increase its dividend payout to shareholders.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A senior City regulator has come under sustained pressure from MPs to explain why he did not order a full-blown investigation into the sell-off of Royal Mail after the shares rose by 38% on the first day. Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), repeatedly told the public accounts committee that he had not seen any evidence to warrant an investigation by his regulator into the sale of the postal operator last year. Royal Mail shares have risen as much as 87% since their flotation in October, although they have now fallen back from their highs to close last night at 511.5p. They were initially priced at 330p. During often hostile questioning, Wheatley said the regulator would launch enquiries into unexplained share movements but that Royal Mail did not fall into this category. \"What's an unusual share price movement if it's not 38%?\" said Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the committee. Wheatley said: \"Most IPOs are priced to see some jump on the first day, and around the world that's a familiar model. Maybe this was a bigger increase than most, but typically they are priced to go.\" Wheatley was giving evidence at the start of a week in which parliamentarians are putting the focus back on the sale of Royal Mail after the National Audit Office (NAO) concluded the government had cost taxpayers \u00a3750m in a single day by selling the shares too cheaply. Vince Cable will give evidence to the business select committee on Tuesday alongside the business minister Michael Fallon, after being recalled in the wake of the damning NAO report. On Wednesday the public accounts committee will meet again to take evidence from senior City figures involved in handling the sale. Sixteen City investors were given priority access to the shares on the basis they would hold them for the long-term, but six sold out entirely with out weeks. \"Would that not have raised a bit of concern?\" asked Labour MP Anne McGuire, given that the government's intention had been to have stable, long-term investors. Also attending the committee hearing, which is open to the public, was private equity expert Jon Moulton, whose firm Better Capital bought Royal Mail competitor City Link from Rentokil a year ago for \u00a31. Wheatley elicited cries of incredulity when he said, sitting alongside his colleague William Amos, that he could not name any fines handed out by the FCA for conflicts of interest within investment banks between advisors handling share sales and the fund management arm which would buy the shares. There is supposed to be a \"Chinese wall\" between the two, and Wheatley said a threshold for an investigation had not been passed by either the share price move or the large number of banks involved. Another MP, Austin Mitchell, said that Lord Nelson would have made a good chairman of the regulator, which was created by the coalition in response to the 2008 banking crisis. Wheatley said: \"An IPO [initial public offering] that goes, on the back of a prospectus and a marketing campaign, to a premium, does not of itself generate a suspicion of regulatory failure.\" \"Our job is to look at whether there has been regulatory failure and there's nothing that I've seen so far that suggests that there was,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p>For a glimpse of what may lie ahead for AstraZeneca should Pfizer succeed in its takeover bid, look no further than the US pharmaceutical group's recent history of major acquisitions.</p> <p>A surge of takeovers began in 2000. That year Pfizer paid $112bn (\u00a367bn) for the US company Warner-Lambert, and its hugely successful anti-cholesterol drug, Lipitor. Then followed the acquisition in 2003 of Pharmacia, a Swedish biotech. In 2009, Pfizer took over another US company, Wyeth, for its biotech drugs and vaccines.</p> <p>What happened next?

      "bodyText": "For a glimpse of what may lie ahead for AstraZeneca should Pfizer succeed in its takeover bid, look no further than the US pharmaceutical group's recent history of major acquisitions. A surge of takeovers began in 2000. That year Pfizer paid $112bn (\u00a367bn) for the US company Warner-Lambert, and its hugely successful anti-cholesterol drug, Lipitor. Then followed the acquisition in 2003 of Pharmacia, a Swedish biotech. In 2009, Pfizer took over another US company, Wyeth, for its biotech drugs and vaccines. What happened next? Once the businesses were under its wing, Pfizer made deep cuts to meet what it called \"business objectives\". Entire research facilities were closed down. Tens of thousands of jobs were axed. The Wyeth deal alone saw Pfizer scrap 19,000 staffers. The strategy aims to grow Pfizer's top line, but it has a serious flaw. Drug companies that slash their investments in research and development similarly cut their chances of making a discovery that leads to a breakthrough drug. Just as science is making greater strides in understanding diseases, the drugs industry is becoming less and less able to turn that knowledge into treatments. Awkwardly for Pfizer, the shortcoming in the company's strategy was pointed out by an authoritative source.

Investors buy currencies for two main reasons: they like the look of the way an economy is performing or they are attracted by the higher interest rates on offer.

But a stronger pound cuts the cost of imports, holding down increases in the cost of living and thus making it easier for the Bank of England to hit the government's 2% inflation target. As measured by the consumer prices index, inflation is currently running at 1.6%, making it relatively simple for the Bank to fend off calls for tighter policy.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. Here's a brief closing summary. Concern is growing that jobs could be cut if Pfizer succeeds in a \u00a360bn takeover of AstraZeneca. The Unite union called on the UK government to demand guarantees on employment and research spending from Pfizer, which has a month to decide whether to launch a bid or walk away after confirming its interest at 7am London time today. Unite national officer Linda McCulloch warned: \u201cIt is absolutely crucial that if Pfizer succeeds in its bid there must be guarantees of no jobs losses and for the protection on the UK\u2019s research and development base. AstraZeneca is strategically significant for the UK economy. We expect the UK government to pay special attention to this bid and do everything possible to protect jobs and to support the UK\u2019s knowledge base.\u201d The opposition Labour party proposed three tests that Pfizer must pass before any deal goes through -- no job cuts, protection of R&amp;D, and long-term commitment to invest in Britain. The GMB union claimed that jobs and R&amp;D work would be shipped out to the Far East. David Cameron's spokesman said that government has no objections, in principle, to an overseas firm buying a UK one. Shares in AstraZeneca closed the day up 14%, valuing the firm at almost \u00a359bn. Earlier, Pfizer's CEO told reporters that a deal would be good news for both companies, and mean the UK gained the world's biggest pharmaceuticals firm. But Ian Read refused to give any firm guarantees on UK jobs. My earlier lunchtime summary has full details. In other news this afternoon.... S&amp;P has downgraded Gazprom and Rosneft, after the US government announced fresh sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. Rosneft's CEO, Igor Sechin, was added to the list. The UK's Serious Fraud Office has opened a probe into possible money laundering from Ukraine, and frozen $23m of assets. MPs have grilled the head of the FCA, Martin Wheatley, over why the City regulator has not investigated the privatisation of Royal Mail, despite widespread concern that the IPO was botched. Highlights start here. There is optimism that the US housing market is picking up, after the number of \"pending home sales\" rose in March, reversing recent falls. Thanks, and goodnight. GW The Serious Fraud Office just announced that it has begun a probe into possible money laundering involving Ukraine, and frozen $23m of assets in the UK. Here's the full, brief, statement: The Director of the SFO has opened a criminal investigation into possible money laundering arising from suspicions of corruption in Ukraine. The SFO has obtained a restraint order freezing approximately $23m of assets in the UK in connection with this case. For reasons of confidentiality we cannot say more at this time. Europe's main stock markets ended the day slightly higher, partly thanks to the M&amp;A optimism. FTSE 100: up 14 points at 6700, + 0.22% German DAX: up 44 points at 9446, + 0.5% French CAC: up 16 points at 4460, +0.4% CMC Market's Jasper Lawler says: New sanctions on Russia from the US Treasury failed to significantly move European stock markets today as the FTSE 100 consolidates around 6700 and the German Dax drifts between 9400 and 9500. He points out that several other pharma stocks rose (although not as dramatically as AstraZeneca's 14% surge): The potential M&amp;A pushed Europe\u2019s pharmaceutical sector higher with Shire, GlaxoSmithKline, BTG and Dechra Pharmaceuticals all making gains. In other M&amp;A news, consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser (the firm behind Cillit Bang, Dettol and Nurofen) has just told the City that it is in talks with Germany's Merck regarding \"an offer for its consumer health business.\" There's no guarantee that it will be successful, it added. News broke over the weekend that Merck was close to selling its consumer healthcare unit, perhaps for almost $14bn, with Reckitt and Bayer both in the running. Reckitt's shares fell over 2% today. Here's the biggest risers on the FTSE 100, with AstraZeneca leading the way: And here's the biggest fallers: Shares in AstraZeneca have closed at \u00a346.66p, a gain of more than 14%. That's five pence above the price which Pfizer suggested paying in January (see opening post). S&amp;P also cut Gazprom's credit rating from BBB to BBB-, with a negative outlook. Not a good day for Rosneft -- S&amp;P just cut its credit rating by one notch to BBB-, a couple of hours after the US imposed sanctions on the company (details here), with a negative outlook. ITV's Joel Hills has written a nice piece explaining why Pzifer is so keen to buy AstraZeneca. Here's a flavour: Crudely put, [Pfizer's CEO Ian Read] thinks this mega takeover (let's call it what it would be) would buy Pfizer: ownership of an exciting pipeline of drugs that AstraZeneca is in the process of developing (in the area of cancer in particular); a phalanx of highly-skilled staff; and the opportunity to save a shed load of money. Mr Read was careful not to elaborate about the \"significant operational synergies\" he spies but they would, of course, involve job losses. They would also involve some large tax savings. Joel also points out that Britain suffered the last time a well-known UK firm was taken over by a US company: The Business Secretary, Vince Cable will want some cast iron reassurances about its long-term commitment to the UK. In 2010 Kraft promised to keep a factory near Bristol open when it took over Cadbury, in 2011 Kraft closed it. In the same year Pfizer closed its R&amp;D centre in Sandwich where 2,400 people worked. More here: Why US drug giant Pfizer's interest in a 'mega takeover' of AstraZeneca concerns us all Correction - it's the Public Accounts Committee that is grilling Martin Wheatley about the Royal Mail privatisation (not the Treasury committee as I wrote before). And the PAC aren't buying Wheatley's argument that there's no sign of \"regulatory failure\" over the float. MPs are demanding to know exactly how the FCA can be confident that all is well, if it hasn't held an actual investigation. Asa Bennett of Huffington Post tweets the details, including veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell apparently comparing Wheatley to Admiral Horatio Nelson (of \"I see no ships\" fame) PAC's chair, Margaret Hodge, is also unimpressed: As Jill Treanor explains here, Goldman Sachs and UBS will face tough questioning from the PAC over their role in the Royal Mail IPO. And here's the key quotes from Martin Wheatley, explaining why the FCA isn't planning to investigate the Royal Mail float (via Reuters): An IPO that goes, on the back of a prospectus and a marketing campaign, to a premium, does not of itself generate a suspicion of regulatory failure. Our job is to look at whether there has been regulatory failure and there's nothing that I've seen so far that suggests that there was a regulatory failure.\" Martin Wheatley, the head of the Financial Services Authority (the City watchdog) has told MPs that he doesn't seen any reason to launch an inquiry into the privatisation of Royal Mail. He's appearing before the Public Accounts Committee this afternoon, a month after the National Audit Office reported that the government's caution of the pricing of the float cost taxpayers \u00a3750m of potential revenue. Pfizer's bid interest in AstraZeneca is giving Wall Street a lift today. Pfizer's shares are still up 3%, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 115 points, or 0.7%, right now. Those upbeat US pending home sales figures also cheered investors, who are not fretting so much about the Ukraine crisis today. Wall Street is looking towards this week's economic data -- including the first estimate of US GDP on Wednesday, and the monthly jobs report on Friday. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York, said: Clearly investors are shifting focus to the rich economic calendar we have this week and other events like the FOMC meeting and away from geopolitical concerns. The latest economic news from America suggests its housing market is, finally, picking up after a winter lull. The National Association of Realtors reported that \"Pending home sales\" (effectively the number of people exchanging contracts on a house) rose by 3.4% month-on-month in March. That suggests actual sales should bounce back as spring turns into summer, having fallen in recent months as mortgage rates crept up, and as the US suffered a pretty grim winter. Back to the future of AstraZeneca.... the Unite union has joined the Labour Party (see here) in calling for guarantees from Pfizer that jobs will not be cut in Britain. Unite national officer, Linda McCulloch warned that Astra staff have been unsettled by Pfizer's interest, and urged the UK government to protect its R&amp;D operations. McCulloch said: \u201cIt is absolutely crucial that if Pfizer succeeds in its bid there must be guarantees of no jobs losses and for the protection on the UK\u2019s research and development base. AstraZeneca is strategically significant for the UK economy. We expect the UK government to pay special attention to this bid and do everything possible to protect jobs and to support the UK\u2019s knowledge base.\u201d As we reported from Westminster earlier, David Cameron's spokesman says the government has no objections in principle to a foreign firm taking over a UK one. Pfizer's shares jumped 3% at the start of trading in Wall Street, gaining almost one dollar to $31.70. AstraZeneca's shares are still up 15% in London. Often, the predator in a takeover battle sees its shares fall. In this case, US investors may be cheered that Pfizer could put some of its offshore tax mountain to good use, and by the prospect of moving its tax base to Britain (see earlier summary). Gazprom's shares have risen 1%, though, after its executives were not hit with sanctions by the US government Shares in Russian oil firm Rosneft have slid almost 2% after the US government added its CEO, Igor Sechin, to the list of executives facing sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. Several other individuals, including Russia's presidential envoy to Crimea, have also been added to the list. A swathe of companies are also being sanctioned, although Rosneft itself is not one of them. fastFT has the full list. The news also sent BP's shares down 1.5% -- it holds a 20% stake in Rosneft, its Russian partner. According to Reuters, CEO Ian Read went on to say Pfizer would be 'disciplined' in how much it would pay for AstraZeneca (it initially proposed a 30% premium in January, but AZ's shares are now higher than that offer). Read also explained that Pfizer usually has between 70 and 90% of its cash reserves outside the US, and would use some to finance an Astra bid. That cash pile was run up by its overseas divisions, and is sitting offshore to avoid being taxed by the US authorities. Ian Read, Pfizer's CEO, is pitching the merits of an AstraZeneca takeover to the US audience. Here's the Reuters snaps: 28-Apr-2014 13:42 - PFIZER CEO SAYS MERGER WOULD BOOST PFIZER EARNINGS THE FIRST FULL YEAR AFTER DEAL IS COMPLETED 28-Apr-2014 13:42 - PFIZER CEO SAYS EPS* GROWTH WOULD ACCELERATE IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS * EPS= earnings per share The opposition Labour party has declared that any takeover bid for AstraZeneca should be subject to three tests -- whether it is good for jobs, protects Britain's high-tech skills base, and whether there are solid guarantees of long-term investment. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: \u201cLabour is clear that any potential takeover of AstraZeneca by Pfizer should be judged on three tests: whether it promotes jobs and growth in the UK pharmaceuticals industry; whether it protects Britain\u2019s knowledge, research and skills base; and whether it comes with guarantees of long-term investment in the UK. We want to see Britain\u2019s research and development capabilities strengthened. This is crucial for expanding the high-skilled jobs we need to earn our way to higher living standards. \u201cWe also want to see a long-term view taken into account when takeovers happen rather than an exclusive focus on the immediate returns for investors and increased transparency over advisors\u2019 fees which are likely to be substantial in a deal of this size.\u201d Pfizer's shares have risen 1.5% in pre-market trading in New York, Reuters reports, ahead of the official opening of Wall Street in 90 minutes time (2.30pm BST). The prospect of a \u00a360bn takeover bid for AstraZeneca helped to drive the pound up to its highest level against the US dollar since 2009, hitting $1.6847 this morning. Our economics reporter Katie Allen writes: Traders said the latest push for the pound came partly from confirmation by the US pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer that it had bid for its UK rivalAstraZeneca and, despite being rebuffed, was still looking at pursuing the biggest ever foreign takeover of a UK company. Expectations of Pfizer sticking with its plan and of other international takeover activity raised the prospect of foreign firms having to buy pounds and so helped strengthen the UK currency. \"This fits into the bigger picture and underlines increasing global demand for assets in the UK and the eurozone... which is why we have seen both the pound and the euro outperform expectations this year,\" said Nawaz Ali, UK market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions Full story: AstraZeneca bid and economic optimism push pound up against dollar David Cameron's official spokesman said the government has no objection in principle to takeovers of British companies by foreign firms, reports our political correspondent Rowena Mason. The PM's spokesman said: \"The fact that Britain has an open trade-based economy which is open both to investment but also British firms investing overseas, that is a strength to the UK. In terms of measures that the UK government takes to attract investment to the UK, in R&amp;D [research and development] and the like, what we have done in the pharmaceutical sector.... we have a range of policies that make us a very attractive place to do business.\" Asked about whether Cameron has any worries for British jobs if Pfizer takes over AstraZeneca, the spokesman said: \"I'm not privy to potential commercials details, but in terms of is the UK a good place to do business for the reasons that I've given, yes it is. We will continue to work with employers and businesses from around the world to continue to see what we can do to make the UK an attractive place to do business. I think we have a strong record in terms of private sector job creation.\" Downing Street could not say whether government ministers have been involved in discussions between AstraZeneca and Pfizer, Rowena adds. As mentioned earlier, Pfizer said it had begun \"initial, preliminary discussions\" with the UK government, and wants to have a fuller conversation to explain why a deal makes sense. AstraZeneca's shares are now up almost 17%, at \u00a347.70. That's one dollar above Pfizer's approach in January, which was rebuffed by AZ (details in the opening post). The GMB union fears that Pfizer could ship AstraZeneca's manufacturing and R&amp;D operations \"to the Far East\", should a takeover to through. It urged the government to refer any bid to the competition authorities. ITV has the details: GMB national officer Allan Black said the Government had a duty to protect against a \"hostile approach\" which would see business going abroad, adding that such a move would also weigh on the balance of payments deficit. Here's a summary of the key points from Pfizer's conference call (coverage starts here) Pfizer has made contact with the UK government over its desire to merge with British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca. Chief executive Ian Read said the combined company would move its tax base to Britain, meaning the world's largest pharmaceutical company would be domiciled in the UK. He told reporters that: We reached out to the UK government this morning. We've have some initial preliminary discussions We want to have a conversation with the government about the excitement we have about combining these portfolios, the excitement we have about the strength of UK research.\" \"This combination, if it occurs, would create domiciled in the UK the largest pharmaceutical company in the world and would bring an injection of about $100 billion into the UK economy.\" But Read could not promise that UK jobs and investment would not be cut, if the deal goes through. He said Pfizer could not make \"any firm commitments\" in this area, although he believes Britain is a good place to do science. He cited the UK's tax breaks for research and development. Read also argued that the merger would benefit patients, as a combined Pfizer-AZ would have a stronger research and development operation. Pfizer didn't give details about whether America's tax revenues would suffer if the deal goes through, but said it didn't want to expose AstraZeneca's revenues to the US corporation tax rate of 38%, compared to the UK's 21%. The final question goes to Helen Thomas of the Financial Times: How Pfizer will explain its change of strategy to its shareholders, after years of making itself smaller and more efficient? Ian Read denies that the pursuit of AstraZeneca is a u-turn in strategy. We will continue to assess whether Pfizer's operations are better inside the company, or outside it, he insists. And that's the end of the call. On that tax angle.... My colleague Sean Farrell is on the call, tweeting the key points: Should the US government be worried about loss of tax revenue, given Pfizer's comments about the tax efficiencies that the deal would yield? Pfizer's Ian Read replies that it does not want to expose AZ's revenues, currently taxed at 21% in the UK, to the US's 38% corporation tax rate. America will remain a hugely important market for us, he adds, and we'd continue to invest there. Why should patients welcome such a deal, given AstraZeneca's clear opposition to a merger, asks ITV's Joel Hills. Ian Read replies that pharmaceuticals firms have been tackling their overlapping portfolios and obsolete products in recent years. That has delivered efficiency savings, and fuelled \"a reacceleration of the research pipeline in the last decade\", he says. Why would Pfizer continue to be listed on the New York stock market if it plans to redomicile its tax base in Britain after the Astra deal? Read says the US stock market is the biggest, and deepest, in the world - so the best place for such a huge company. Can Pfizer make any commitments that jobs won't be cut in the UK, or about future investment? Ian Read cannot. He cautions that: I cannot make any firm commitments.... We do see the UK as an attractive place to do science. And he reiterates that Britain does offer attractive incentives, and that jobs and R&amp;D usually follow those kind of incentives. Pfizer has not yet held talks with the US government about the deal. Ashley Armstrong of the Telegraph also asks about the prospect of job cuts if the deal goes through. Read says that is already plenty of consolidations in the pharma industry, as the markets demand \"improved efficiencies and productivity. Ben Griffiths of the Daily Mail asks how many jobs will be cut if AstraZeneca is taken over, and whether Pfizer will pay the full rate of corporation tax. Ian Read replies that one attractive side of the deal is that Pfizer would domicile the largest pharmaceuticals company in the world in Britain. The UK offers attractive incentive for firms to conduct research and development in Britain. \"Investment and jobs follow\" appropriate incentives, the Pfizer CEO adds. And on tax, Read insists that Pfizer complies with the tax code, and \"fully pay our tax bills in every country we operate in\". Why are big deals back in fashion in the pharmaceuticals world? Read says pharma firms must deliver products faster, deliver more product, and achieve better value for money. Mergers, and asset swaps, are a good way of achieving it. Onto questions...after a slight hiccup. Has Pfizer had discussions with the UK government about the deal, about issues such as jobs guarantees? Read says it \"reached out\" to the UK government this morning, to explain the excitement it feels about the deal. We had very early discussions. He mentions the prospect of enhancing R&amp;D in the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle. He also told the government that Pfizer would redomicile its tax base in the UK, meaning Britain would host the world's biggest pharmaceutical firm. And the deal would also inject around $100bn into the UK economy (that's the current value of AstraZeneca). What impact would redomiciling Pfizer's tax base in Britain have? It's too early to say, but Pfizer would indeed redomicile in the UK, the company adds. Ian Read concludes by saying Pfizer will abide by the UK takeover code -- it could choose to walk away, or make a firm offer. Pfizer's Ian Read, incidentally, is that rare thing -- a Brit running a US company, having been born and raised in Scotland. Turning to his own company, Read says AstraZeneca shareholders may not know that Pfizer generated revenues of $51.6bn last year, and operates in 150 countries with 56 manufacturing sites worldwide. Financially we're a strong company, he says, with a track record of returning cash to shareholders. Our total return to shareholders from 2011-2013 (share price gain plus dividends) was over 97%, he adds, ahead of the Wall Street average. On the medical side, Read says merging with AstraZeneca would enhance Pzifer's offering in oncology, immunology, cardiovascular and diabetes products, and R&amp;D. It would also boost its footprint in emerging markets. Pfizer's CEO is running through the announcement issued to the London stock market this morning (online here). Read says Pfizer is \" currently reconsidering our options regarding AstraZeneca\", after making its second approach to AZ on Saturday. But it still believes a combination makes sense, creating a company better able to develop new pharmaceutical products. There's a \"compelling\" case for merging AZ and Pfizer, he says. Read also repeats that Pfizer has great respect for AZ's \"proud heritage\" as a leader in the biopharmaceutical business. We'll get onto questions shortly. Heads-up: Pfizer is holding a conference call with journalists now, with chief executive Ian Read. I'm dialled in, so will cover the key points... Just in: AstraZeneca has urged its shareholders to sit tight and take no action regarding Pfizer's declaration of interest in their company. In a statement to the City, AstraZeneca confirmed that they did receive a new approach on Saturday, but declined (again) to engage with Pfizer. It said: On 26 April 2014, Ian Read, Chairman and CEO of Pfizer, contacted Leif Johansson, the Chairman of AstraZeneca for the first time since January 2014. In this discussion, the Chairman of Pfizer did not make a specific proposal regarding an offer to acquire AstraZeneca, but nevertheless Pfizer requested that both companies issue a joint statement, prior to the market open on 28 April 2014, announcing that they had entered into discussions regarding a combination. The Board of AstraZeneca considered this request and concluded that, absent a specific and attractive proposal, it was not appropriate to engage in discussions with Pfizer. Astra also explained that it rebuffed Pfizer's first approach, in January, because it \"materially undervalued\" its assets. It also expressed concern that the bid was largely priced in Pfizer shares, and insisted that it enjoys bright prospects as an independent company. The statement is online here. The prospect of a \u00a360bn takeover bid for AstraZeneca from Pfizer has given the City another dose of M&amp;A fever today. Peter Dickinson, partner at international law firm Mayer Brown, points out that many companies are sitting on huge cash piles, and may now be confident enough to dip into them. He says: \u201cSince the start of 2014 we have seen a definite increase in investor confidence as macro-economic conditions improve, which in turn has led to a material up-turn in cross-border merger and acquisitions activity. Many large corporates are sitting on enviable cash piles, and feel that now is the time to benefit from the economic recovery. Large scale pharmaceutical mergers can also bring huge cost savings across two groups, and investor demand for big deals remains healthy.\u201d Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, cautions that deal-making is an tricky business: \"Merger news is all the rage in the sector at the moment, but over-eager corporate executives should heed the words of GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, who noted that major deals in the sector often result in firms acquiring unwanted elements along with the core business. This makes integration a longer and messier business. The current breakdown in the Publicis/Omnicom merger, which was supposed to be a done deal, is also a salutary lesson for those keen on making their name through empire building.\" Back in the stock market, shares in oil and gas producer BG Group have tumbled almost 4%. It warned that ongoing problems in Egypt mean it will only reach the lower end of its production target. It also announced the immediate departure of its CEO, Chris Finlayson, for \"personal reasons\". Chairman Andrew Gould suggested that BG must pick up its game, saying: The Company must accelerate the creation and delivery of the longer-term value for our shareholders, while delivering the Group's business plans. The Board felt that it was in the best interests of the Group to accept Chris' resignation and seek fresh leadership to deliver both of these priorities. Italy's new prime minister Matteo Renzi appears to have worked his magic on the country's weary population, as consumer confidence in Italy hits its highest level in four years. ISTAT, the country's statistics body, reported that consumer morale jumped this month. Its confidence climate index hit 105.4, much stronger than March's 101.9 -- suggesting Renzi's pledge to cut income tax for low earners has cheered Italians, and could deliver a much-needed spending boost. In the eurozone, Slovenia's sovereign bonds are being hit after the country's prime minister lost the leadership of her party. The yield, or interest rate, on Slovenian 10-year debt has jumped to 3.948% this morning, from 3.7% on Friday night. That follows Alenka Bratu\u0161ek's ousting as leader of the Positive Slovenia (PS) party over the weekend, which is likely to lead to her resignation as PM, and possibly early general elections. Bratu\u0161ek had won credit in Europe for avoiding a bailout; last December, Slovenia announced plans to recapitalise its struggling banks without external help. But her programme of austerity and privatisations proved unpopular in Slovenia, leading to her defeat to Zoran Jankovic, the mayor of Ljubljana, late on Friday. Jankovic has criticised Bratu\u0161ek's spending cuts, and called for more initiatives to stimulate growth and employment. At 3.9%, Slovenia's yields are still some distance from the 7% 'danger zone', where it would be locked out of the markets. But today's move shows concern that Slovenia's economic reform programme could be deadlocked for months, if the government falls. The cost of insuring Slovenia's debt against default has also risen, as this tweet shows: Here's the full story of Pfizer's attempts to hook up with Astra, by Sean Farrell: Pfizer has set the stage for a battle to buy Britain's AstraZeneca after the US drugs giant said it was willing to pay almost \u00a360bn to secure the biggest foreign takeover of a UK company. The news sent AstraZeneca's shares soaring by 15%, to \u00a346.91, adding almost \u00a38bn to the company's market value. In a statement to the stock exchange, the world's biggest drug group said it had approached AstraZeneca twice this year about a takeover but had been rejected both times. Pfizer made its first approach in January and indicated it was willing to pay \u00a346.61 a share in cash and shares, valuing the AstraZeneca at \u00a358.8bn. The companies discussed a potential deal but AstraZeneca broke off talks on 14 January. The US company contacted AstraZeneca again on Saturday about reopening talks but the UK company rejected the approach. Pfizer, best known for producing Viagra, said it was considering its options and that it was considering a cash and shares offer at a \"significant premium\" to AstraZeneca's share price. Under takeover rules it has until 26 May to make a firm offer unless an extension is granted. More here: Pfizer preparing \u00a360bn bid for AstraZeneca The FT's Joseph Cotterill cautions that a merger could actually hurt both companies research arms, in the short term: The pound has hit a four-and a half-year high against the US dollar, this morning, up almost half a cent to $1.685. Not great news for British exporters (such as AstraZeneca) who have already been warning that the strength of sterling has hit demand for their goods. City AM has a good take on this issue today, flagging up that \u00a33.5bn has been wiped off this year\u2019s dividend payments from FTSE 100 companies (partly because many pay divi's in dollars). BRITISH investors will lose out on billions of pounds due to soaring sterling, raising fears the currency will undermine the competitiveness of City-based multinationals and hammer shareholders. Here's their full story: City squeezed by stronger pound Which includes this neat graphic: Interesting angle on taxation too -- Pfizer plans to create a new UK-incorporated holding company if the merger goes ahead. That would means AstraZeneca's non-US profits would not be subject to US tax, it says. What's in it for the public? Pfizer claims that patients across the globe would benefit from combining its research and development operations with Astra's. Ian Read, Pfizer CEO, says a shared commitment to R&amp;D could yield: potential new therapies that help to fight some of the world's most feared diseases, such as cancer. AstraZeneca is one of Britain's most important companies -- it sells \u00a37bn of medicines overseas each year, or 2.3% of the UK's total goods exports. It employs 7,000 people directly, and reckons it 'supports' 30,000 jobs in all. Pfizer has tried to calm fears that a takeover could lead to major job losses or economic damage, saying: \"We have great respect for AstraZeneca and its proud heritage as an innovation-driven biopharmaceutical business with a rich science-based foundation in both the United Kingdom and Sweden. In addition, the United Kingdom has created attractive incentives for companies to manufacture products and maintain and protect intellectual property, and we have seen that capital and jobs have followed these types of incentives.\" That's not a full-blown commitment not to cut jobs or operations in the UK, of course . Pfizer says that a merged company would maintain head offices in the US, and be listed on Wall Street, with management in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Update: It's confirmed that the company's tax domicile would shift to the UK. Astra's surging share price has driven the FTSE 100 index up by 0.3%, back over the 6,700 point mark to 6708. That share surge has boosted AstraZeneca's value by almost \u00a38bn -- the company is now being valued at over \u00a351bn. Shares in AstraZeneca have jumped 15% at the start of trading in London, as investors react to Pfizer's public declaration of interest. They have hit \u00a347.07, above the \u00a346.61 which Pfizer proposed paying in January. Justin Urquhart Stewart, head of City firm Seven Investment Management (7IM), reckons we could see an old-style hostile takeover battle: Here's Pfizer's full statement confirming its interest in Astra, and revealing it made a second approach on Saturday: Pfizer Inc: Statement re Possible Offer Good morning. Big news to start the day -- Pfizer has confirmed that it is interested in merging with Britain's AstraZeneca, in what would be the biggest foreign takeover of a UK listed company. The US pharmaceuticals giant announced that it made a new approach to AstraZeneca on Saturday, in an attempt to hammer out a deal that could be worth $100bn, or\u00a360bn, but had been rebuffed by their UK rival. In a statement to the City, it said: In light of recent market developments, Pfizer contacted AstraZeneca on 26 April 2014 seeking to renew discussions in order to develop a proposal that could be recommended by both companies to their shareholders. AstraZeneca again declined to engage. Pfizer is currently considering its options with respect to AstraZeneca. Pfizer also confirmed that it had made a initial approach in January. At that stage, it was prepared to pay almost a third more than the company was valued -- some \u00a346.61 per AstraZeneca share, compared to their value of \u00a335.86 on 3 January 2014. Astra's shares soared last week as after Pfizer's initial approach was reported, closing at \u00a340.80. January's slapdown hasn't put Pfizer off -- it says it is confident that a combination can be \"consummated\". Pfizer's CEO, Ian Read, claimed the two firms could make an enticing combination, declaring: The combination of Pfizer and AstraZeneca could further enhance the ability to create value for shareholders of both companies and bring an expanded portfolio of important treatments to patients. A potential combination with AstraZeneca aligns with Pfizer's current structure and fully supports its existing strategy to build world-class businesses. The combination would complement our two innovative businesses and our Global Established Pharmaceutical business, allowing us to maintain the flexibility for the potential future separation of our businesses whilst at the same time broadening our pipeline breadth and potential new product launches over coming years. But with AstraZeneca rejecting Saturday's approach, the lines have been drawn for a dramatic takeover tussle. Reaction to follow, including how Astra's share price responds to Pfizer's public declaration of interest..... I'll also be tracking all the other key events in the markets, economics, the eurozone and business through the day...",

      "standfirst": "Francois Hollande met GE and Siemens representatives amid concerns over French jobs at the manufacturer of TGV trains", 
      "body": "<p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande met rival German and US bidders for Alstom, one of France's biggest industrial groups, on Monday amid concerns that it could fall into American hands.</p> <p>At a hastily called meeting at the Elys\u00e9e Palace, the French president talked to representatives from General Electric and Munich-based Siemens and General Electric in a move to protect French jobs at the group that makes the French rail network's TGV trains and the Pendolino fleet used by Virgin Trains, as well as owning an energy business. The loss of Alstom to a US buyer would be a political and public blow to the country's beleaguered and unpopular Socialist administration, with the interest of Siemens viewed as a route to a more acceptable compromise.</p> <p>Hours before Monday's meeting, several government ministers were summoned by Hollande to discuss the future of the company. The French state sold its interest in Alstom in 2006 and has little power to intervene directly, but Hollande and his ministers have made it clear they prefer a European rather than US solution to Alstom's difficulties, and expect to be closely consulted about the its future.</p> <p>The discussions centre on whether Siemens will relinquish its transport arm to Alstom in return for the French company handing over its energy division, to create what one Siemens source told Le Monde would be \"two European champions; one in energy, the other in transport\".</p> <p>The French government stepped in last week after it emerged that talks between Alstom and GE were already at an advanced stage. The US company had offered around \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.2bn) for Alstom's energy unit, which accounts for 70% of group revenues and whose products include coal-powered turbines.</p> <p>Hollande said on Monday night that the French state had an interest in what happened to Alstom, \"because the state places orders [for] a certain number of purchases in sectors that are strategic, namely energy. That's the reason the state uses its position and why everyone understands this \u2026 and so that the offers are improved regarding jobs and activities carried out in France.\"</p> <p>Speaking to a gathering of local administrative chiefs, he said: \"Those who thought that it would be the market that determined my choices, that it would be solely private individuals who might use agreements and contracts to override the general interest, were wrong.</p> <p>\"The French are very attached to their state, and they want an efficient state.\"</p> <p>The economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, who had warned of \"patriotic\" concerns over a GE deal last week, told France's RTL radio on Monday he would not accept that \"in three days, Alstom can decide to sell \u2026 a national jewel behind the backs of the employees, the government, most of the board and senior executives\".</p> <p>Describing the situation as unacceptable, Montebourg said: \"French firms are not prey. However, we are prepared to make alliances enabling us to face global competition. In the last few days we have taken several initiatives, the first being to reject a fait accompli.\"</p> <p>Around three-quarters of Alstom's portfolio is in the energy sector \u2013 the company also makes steam turbines for nuclear power plants \u2013 and it employs 93,000 people around the world, including 18,000 in France.</p> <p>Following the French government's obvious disquiet over GE's offer, Siemens wrote to Alstom's management at the weekend saying it was ready \"to discuss future strategic opportunities\".</p> <p>Siemens had expressed an interest in its rival Alstom's energy holdings in 2004 \u2013 around the time the French government ordered a bailout to save the group and it shed its shipbuilding interests \u2013 but its advances were rebuffed. Two years later the government sold its stake in the company. In spite of intense pressure from the government, Patrick Kron, Alstom's chief executive, is opposed to any partnership or takeover by the German company.</p> <p>Following Siemens' counter-offensive, Alstom announced that dealing in its shares on the French stock exchange would be suspended for two days of \"strategic reflection\". A decision is expected on Wednesday. It said in a statement: \"Alstom is continuing and deepening its strategic reflection and will inform the market some time before the morning of Wednesday 30 April. As a result, the company has asked that trading in its shares remains suspended.\"</p> <p>Hollande met the head of GE, Jeff Immelt, on Monday morning and was scheduled to meet the president of Siemens, Joe Kaeser, later. Martin Bouygues, Alstom's main shareholder with a 29.4% stake in the company, was due for talks at the Elys\u00e9e on Monday evening.</p> <p>After the meeting Immelt issued a statement saying: \"The talks were open, friendly and productive \u2026 it was important to hear in person President Hollande's point of view and to discuss our plans. We have agreed to work together.\"</p> <p>The economist Nicolas Bouzou said the government's only weapon was verbal pressure, and said he feared the French state's bullish approach to GE would have the opposite effect to that desired.</p> <p>He told the newspaper Le Parisien: \"The state's position is legitimate, given that the government wants to protect a company that is in the strategic sectors of transport and energy, but acting for the sake of public opinion is no good. Some back room diplomacy would be better.\"</p> <p>Montebourg told Le Monde: \"Alstom is a symbol of France's industrial power and our ingenuity.

At a hastily called meeting at the Elys\u00e9e Palace, the French president talked to representatives from General Electric and Munich-based Siemens and General Electric in a move to protect French jobs at the group that makes the French rail network's TGV trains and the Pendolino fleet used by Virgin Trains, as well as owning an energy business. The loss of Alstom to a US buyer would be a political and public blow to the country's beleaguered and unpopular Socialist administration, with the interest of Siemens viewed as a route to a more acceptable compromise. Hours before Monday's meeting, several government ministers were summoned by Hollande to discuss the future of the company. The French state sold its interest in Alstom in 2006 and has little power to intervene directly, but Hollande and his ministers have made it clear they prefer a European rather than US solution to Alstom's difficulties, and expect to be closely consulted about the its future. The discussions centre on whether Siemens will relinquish its transport arm to Alstom in return for the French company handing over its energy division, to create what one Siemens source told Le Monde would be \"two European champions; one in energy, the other in transport\". The French government stepped in last week after it emerged that talks between Alstom and GE were already at an advanced stage. The US company had offered around \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.2bn) for Alstom's energy unit, which accounts for 70% of group revenues and whose products include coal-powered turbines. Hollande said on Monday night that the French state had an interest in what happened to Alstom, \"because the state places orders [for] a certain number of purchases in sectors that are strategic, namely energy. That's the reason the state uses its position and why everyone understands this \u2026 and so that the offers are improved regarding jobs and activities carried out in France.\" Speaking to a gathering of local administrative chiefs, he said: \"Those who thought that it would be the market that determined my choices, that it would be solely private individuals who might use agreements and contracts to override the general interest, were wrong. \"The French are very attached to their state, and they want an efficient state.\" The economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, who had warned of \"patriotic\" concerns over a GE deal last week, told France's RTL radio on Monday he would not accept that \"in three days, Alstom can decide to sell \u2026 a national jewel behind the backs of the employees, the government, most of the board and senior executives\". Describing the situation as unacceptable, Montebourg said: \"French firms are not prey. However, we are prepared to make alliances enabling us to face global competition. In the last few days we have taken several initiatives, the first being to reject a fait accompli.\" Around three-quarters of Alstom's portfolio is in the energy sector \u2013 the company also makes steam turbines for nuclear power plants \u2013 and it employs 93,000 people around the world, including 18,000 in France. Following the French government's obvious disquiet over GE's offer, Siemens wrote to Alstom's management at the weekend saying it was ready \"to discuss future strategic opportunities\". Siemens had expressed an interest in its rival Alstom's energy holdings in 2004 \u2013 around the time the French government ordered a bailout to save the group and it shed its shipbuilding interests \u2013 but its advances were rebuffed. Two years later the government sold its stake in the company. In spite of intense pressure from the government, Patrick Kron, Alstom's chief executive, is opposed to any partnership or takeover by the German company. Following Siemens' counter-offensive, Alstom announced that dealing in its shares on the French stock exchange would be suspended for two days of \"strategic reflection\". A decision is expected on Wednesday. It said in a statement: \"Alstom is continuing and deepening its strategic reflection and will inform the market some time before the morning of Wednesday 30 April. As a result, the company has asked that trading in its shares remains suspended.\" Hollande met the head of GE, Jeff Immelt, on Monday morning and was scheduled to meet the president of Siemens, Joe Kaeser, later. Martin Bouygues, Alstom's main shareholder with a 29.4% stake in the company, was due for talks at the Elys\u00e9e on Monday evening. After the meeting Immelt issued a statement saying: \"The talks were open, friendly and productive \u2026 it was important to hear in person President Hollande's point of view and to discuss our plans. We have agreed to work together.\" The economist Nicolas Bouzou said the government's only weapon was verbal pressure, and said he feared the French state's bullish approach to GE would have the opposite effect to that desired. He told the newspaper Le Parisien: \"The state's position is legitimate, given that the government wants to protect a company that is in the strategic sectors of transport and energy, but acting for the sake of public opinion is no good. Some back room diplomacy would be better.\" Montebourg told Le Monde: \"Alstom is a symbol of France's industrial power and our ingenuity. The government is concerned and urges patriotic vigilance.\"",

      "bodyText": "At first glance, the letter in the Financial Times (\u00a3) looks like another rant about Barclays' pay policies. The bank is an easy target after last week's acrimonious annual meeting where investors large and small rounded on the bank over its decision to increase its bonus pot by 10% in a year when profits fell by 32% and shareholders were asked to back a \u00a35.8bn cash call. But it is the signature at the end \u2013 Robert Pickering \u2013 that makes the latest attack more painful. Pickering used to run Cazenove, now JP Morgan Cazenove after a deal struck by the former partnership with the US investment bank. He takes umbrage at the use of the phrase \"death spiral\" by the Barclays boss Antony Jenkins to explain the need to pay out higher bonuses after the bank's investment bankers, particularly those in the US, threatened to leave. Pickering writes about how he was \"regularly held up at gunpoint\" by colleagues demanding bigger pay cheques to stop them leaving (usually for Goldman Sachs), and argues that investment bankers have an interest in perpetuating the myth of this so-called \"death spiral\". \"It is absolutely ingrained in the culture of these organisations and Mr Jenkins' antagonists at (the investment bank) in the US, having been schooled in the rough, tough world of Lehman Brothers, will be master exponents of the art form,\" he wrote. Pickering provides his own anecdote about succumbing to the demands: \"In the febrile days of 2000, my predecessor was told that the very survival of the 200-year-old firm was dependent on the continued employment of a 20-something individual who had been in the industry for about 18 months. We offered him a partnership but he left anyway. A few years later I reminded my senior management team of this incident and none of us, myself included, could remember his name.\" His remedy? A tough and experienced manager who can face down the threats. Pickering \u2013 who left the banking industry in 2008, no doubt cushioned by a number of fat pay cheques \u2013 does not appear to think Jenkins can be described this way. He concludes: \"It is possible that Mr Jenkins will prove his doubters wrong and come out on top, but from my armchair it looks like an unequal fight and my money would be on the investment bankers.\" Pickering has penned a number of letters to the FT from that armchair, on subjects ranging from the Olympics opening ceremony to investment banks overcharging for their services. His latest missive, though, strikes a popular chord. Jenkins, of course, will not need this reminder as only last week he was promising shareholders he would not do it again. The message then was wait for the outcome of the investment banking strategy review on 8 May. We'll see how tough Jenkins can be then.",

The US company contacted AstraZeneca on Saturday but AstraZeneca refused to hold talks without a specific proposal for an attractive offer. A fund manager at one of AstraZeneca's top 10 investors said he was unhappy that details of January's approach were forced out by Pfizer's statement and that AstraZeneca should talk to Pfizer. \"I think what Pfizer is attempting to do is to put pressure on AstraZeneca's board to engage. I would have thought the board would be under increased pressure to think seriously about the correct valuation of this business. \"This is important news and it is potentially unwise for boards not to disclose this sort of information. This is a credible approach from another of the world's biggest companies.\" AstraZeneca said Pfizer's overture undervalued the company and only offered shareholders 30% of the price in cash. It also raised concerns about risks involved in Pfizer's proposal to move its headquarters to the UK for tax purposes. Under Pfizer's plan, the combined company would be incorporated in the UK with shares listed in New York and management in Britain and the US. The arrangement would mean Pfizer would not pay US tax on its non-US earnings. Ian Read, Pfizer's Scottish-born chief executive, said the tax structure would protect AstraZeneca's revenues from the 38% rate of corporation tax in the US. UK corporation tax is 21% and will fall to 20% next year. A deal would raise concerns about job losses among AstraZeneca's 7,200 employees in the UK and 50,000-strong workforce worldwide. Pfizer recently closed its main UK research and development centre at Sandwich in Kent with the loss of 2,400 jobs. The closure was a blow to the local economy and the government's ambition to increase high-skill jobs. Read said the proposed deal would let Pfizer eliminate \"redundant functions\" and overlapping operations and refused to pledge that manufacturing would stay in the UK. \"I can't make any firm commitments. We see the UK as an attractive place to do science and manufacturing. Jobs and investment tend to follow incentives. \"You need to look at this restructuring in the context of an industry responding to society's request for increases in efficiency and productivity.\" A takeover of AstraZeneca, which is one of the biggest employers in Chancellor George Osborne's Tatton constituency, would be by far the largest foreign acquisition of a UK company, dwarfing Kraft's \u00a312bn buy-up of Cadbury in 2010 and Telefonica of Spain's \u00a317bn takeover of O2 in 2005. Osborne said last week that a bid by Pfizer was \"a commercial matter\" for the two companies. Allan Black, the GMB union's national officer for the chemicals industry, said: \"What we face here is a hostile approach by this US company to eventually migrate these well paid UK-based manufacturing and research and development jobs to the Far East.\" Pfizer said it was was considering an offer at a \"significant premium\" to AstraZeneca's share price. Under takeover rules it has until 26 May to make a firm offer unless an extension is granted. Pfizer said an offer for AstraZeneca would give the UK group's shareholders a payout worth much more than the \"undisturbed\" share price on 17 April, before bid speculation started. The shares closed that day at \u00a337.83 but after Pfizer's announcement jumped to \u00a347.07 \u2013 above Pfizer's earlier mooted offer and valuing AstraZeneca at \u00a359.5bn. Speculation about a possible bid from Pfizer has sent AstraZeneca's shares up since Easter. The UK company's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said last week a takeover at a standard premium would undervalue the company and the progress it was making in developing new products, for example cancer drugs. Pfizer is said to be keen to put to use some of its \u00a340bn cash pile obtained from its foreign subsidiaries, which would trigger big tax bills if it was repatriated to the US to be paid in dividends.",

A new report released on Monday says ANZ, Westpac, National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth Bank have invested in a range of countries across the Asia Pacific that had been involved in land grabs that left locals homeless. \u201cFrom PNG and Cambodia to Indonesia and Brazil, our banks have backed companies accused of forcing people from their land,\u201d said Oxfam Australia\u2019s chief executive, Dr Helen Szoke. \u201cThis involvement has also resulted in billions of dollars of exposure for everyday Australians who have their money in accounts with these banks, or who own bank shares directly or through their superannuation funds.\u201d According to the report, ANZ Bank provided financial support for a sugar plantation involving child labour and forced evictions, and Westpac is supporting a timber company logging rainforest in Papua New Guinea. NAB funds a palm oil company, Wilmar, which has been linked to land grabs in Indonesia and Malaysia, and the Commonwealth Bank has invested in an agricultural business which operates a Brazilian sugar mill that is accused of evicting indigenous communities from their land. \u201cThe banks need to say which companies they\u2019re investing in, and where those companies have pushed people off the land, to work with those companies to change their practices and provide compensation to communities,\u201d Szoke said.
