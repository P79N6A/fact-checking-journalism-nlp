      "bodyText": "US stock markets dropped dramatically on Friday afternoon, dragging overall global markets to their worst week of the year as concerns about the health of the Chinese economy rattled investors across the world. All of the main US indices closed down more than 3% on Friday, the fourth consecutive day of falls. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 531 points, or 3.1%, to 16,460 \u2013 the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.2% to 1,971 and the Nasdaq closed down 3.5% to 4,706. Most major markets around the world also suffered bruising losses as new data suggested Chinese factory activity had slowed to levels last seen in 2009 and added to investors\u2019 fears about the country\u2019s economy since Beijing devalued its currency last week. US oil prices also crashed down to below $40 a barrel a one point, a level not seen since the financial crisis. The dollar fell to a two-month low against the euro and added to speculation that the Federal Reserve may now not raise US interest rates next month, as had been widely expected by economists. The Dow Jones index has lost about 10% from its record closing high on 19 May, mean it is entering a correction \u2013 a fall of at least 10% from a recent peak. The Dow has not fallen into correction territory since October 2011. Friday\u2019s fall takes the Dow to its sharpest weekly decline in four years. Stocks had already fallen sharply in Europe, Asia and Australia. In London, the FTSE 100 closed down 180 points, or 2.8%, to 6,187 \u2013 the lowest it has been this year and the biggest one-day fall since October 2014. The UK index closed down for nine straight sessions \u2013 its longest losing streak since 2011. The FTSE 100 has fallen by 5.6% this week, which equates to around \u00a393bn ($146bn) being wiped off the value of the UK\u2019s largest listed companies. The Euro Stoxx 50, the continent\u2019s 50 biggest companies, closed down 2.94% to 3,254.77 points and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 1.8% to 1,450.18 points, its lowest level since January and on course for its biggest weekly fall of the year. France\u2019s CAC-40 declined 2.2% while Germany\u2019s DAX fell 1.9%. The global stock market falls came after Beijing released manufacturing data showing fresh evidence of problems at the heart of the Chinese economy. The preliminary Caixin China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for August fell to a 77-month low. Following the report the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 4.3% to its lowest level since March. \u201cChina has sent shockwaves through global markets and raised numerous questions on the outlook,\u201d analysts at Societe Generale said. \u201cTo our minds, the gradual recovery taking shape in the advanced economies can weather what we expect will be a prolonged period of weaker growth in a number of the major emerging markets.\u201d David Madden, market analyst at IG, said: \u201cChina has been on a mission to keep up the illusion of a gradual slowdown, but dealers aren\u2019t buying it anymore.\u201d Nigel Green, chief executive of financial consulting firm deVere Group, told Reuters: \u201cThere are many, and legitimate, contributing factors to the global economic slowdown narrative. These include China-related issues, such as the recent devaluation of its currency, the stock market\u2019s boom and bust in recent months, and slower GDP growth. \u201cI believe that this volatility is likely to remain with us, at least until the end of the year ... But for most long-term investors, fears of a near-term financial apocalypse are overdone.\u201d Connor Campbell, an analyst at Financials, predicted more lows to come. Oil and mining stocks were \u201cdrowning in losses\u201d from the beginning of the day, he said. Japan\u2019s Nikkei average dropped almost 3% to six-week lows on Friday, while the Kopsi index in South Korea fell 1.92%. The Australian stock market, which is heavily loaded with companies reliant on Chinese growth, closed down 1.4%. The benchmark ASX 200 has lost 8.5% so far this month \u2013 the steepest monthly fall since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Australian dollar, considered a liquid proxy for China demand, slid to $0.7285 at one point and was last trading at $0.7330, a fall of 0.08%. The Malaysian ringgit hit a 17-year low and South Korea\u2019s won fell again to take its weekly losses against the dollar to 1.8%. \u201cThe perfect storm that has enveloped EM local markets looks set to continue,\u201d Barclays analysts said in a note. Crude oil prices, which have come under growing pressure from oversupply from the US, Russia and the Middle East, fell in response to concerns that lower manufacturing output in China will cut world demand. Brent crude closed at $45.30 a barrel, down from more than $60 in June and $115 little more than a year ago. Lower oil prices are expected to boost growth in the US, Japan and the major importing nations in Europe in the longer term, but the initial impact has been felt on emerging economies that export oil and other basic commodities that have also slumped in price. Oil\u2019s run of weekly losses is its worst since 1986, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) ramped up production and sent it as low as $10 a barrel.",

      "bodyText": "World stock markets have suffered their worst week of the year so far as concerns about the health of the Chinese economy rattle investors across the globe. Amid growing concern over a potential hard landing for China and the prospect of a US rate rise, there have been sharp moves on commodity and currency markets as well. \u201cMarkets finished the week much the way they started; worried about the impact of a sell-off in emerging market stocks and currencies. No market has been spared this week since slowing global growth has a global impact,\u201d commented Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets UK. Here are the big six factor affecting markets. 1. China\u2019s stock market rout Chinese shares have tumbled in recent weeks against the backdrop of a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Buoyed by an army of individual investors, many of whom borrowed heavily to speculate on shares, the Shanghai stock market had surged more than 150% in 12 months before heavy selling started in June. Despite emergency measures from Beijing officials designed to stabilise the markets and restore confidence in the economy, this week alone the Shanghai Composite Index fell more than 11%. 2. The falling yuan China\u2019s surprise currency devaluation earlier this month only served to heighten fears about the state of its economy and the potential impact on the rest of the world. In the biggest one-off devaluation of its currency in two decades the country\u2019s central bank allowed the yuan, also called the renminbi, to weaken by nearly 2%. Economists note that the fall has been significant enough to dent investor confidence around the world but at the same time probably too small to do much for Chinese exports. 3. Tumbling oil prices The apparent slowdown in China, the world\u2019s biggest energy consumer, has combined with a pick-up in crude production to knock oil prices down sharply. The price of Brent crude has more than halved since a peak of $115 per barrel last summer. The news this weak of a sharp drop in Chinese manufacturing fanned fears that demand for oil has further to fall and at under $46 per barrel now, Brent crude is near a six-year low reached earlier this year. US crude prices have fallen for eight weeks running, the most protracted decline since 1986. 4. An interest rate shock waiting to happen? Monetary policy has been ultra-loose in advanced economies for years now. The global financial crisis prompted record low interest rates and saw central banks pump floods of electronic money into gridlocked financial markets, via quantitative easing (QE) programmes. Now investors are asking when the policymakers will tighten the screws. In the US, the main policy rate has been held at near-zero since the 2008 crisis. Recent signals from the US Federal Reserve suggest the central bank is gearing up for the first interest rate increase in nearly a decade as soon as next month. The prospect of higher borrowing costs and a strengthening dollar have unsettled financial markets and prompted big moves of capital. 5. Emerging markets rattled During the years of cheap money on the back of vast QE programmes in advanced economies, there were large flows of funds to developing economies. With interest rates low at home, investors from advanced economies parked their money in the higher-yielding currencies of the emerging economies. But now expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike in coming months have prompted money to pour back out of emerging markets. Such markets suffered an outflow of almost $1tn of funds in the past year. On top of that, China\u2019s slowdown and stock market woes are rippling out to knock confidence in other emerging markets. Malaysia\u2019s ringgit currency has been one of the big losers, falling to a fresh 17-year low on Friday. The falls in emerging market currencies, which also include the Indonesian rupiah and Thai baht, make it harder for governments and businesses to make payments in dollars. 6. Gold in demand Gold prices have been choppy in recent weeks, as two big market forces play off against each other. Gold does not pay any kind of interest or dividend to its holders and so money has flowed out of the precious metal on the prospect of higher US interest rates. It hit a five-year low in July. But at the same time gold continues to be seen as a safe investment in times of trouble and the latest market jitters and fears of a global slowdown have lifted the price. Against the backdrop of tumbling stocks and a sliding dollar, gold touched a six-week high on Friday.",

Such markets suffered an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/19/emerging-markets-shine-dims-as-capital-flight-nudges-1tn-in-a-year\">outflow of almost $1tn of funds</a> in the past year. On top of that, China\u2019s slowdown and stock market woes are rippling out to knock confidence in other emerging markets. Malaysia\u2019s ringgit currency has been one of the big losers, falling to a fresh 17-year low on Friday. The falls in emerging market currencies, which also include the Indonesian rupiah and Thai baht, make it harder for governments and businesses to make payments in dollars.</p> <h2>6.

      "bodyText": "Lidl has begun testing a loyalty scheme in Scotland as the discounter tries to keep up the pace of growth in the face of a fightback by major supermarkets. The German-owned chain has sent out 4m \u201csmarter shopping\u201d cards by direct mail, through newspapers and via its 90 Scottish stores \u2013 less than a year after it took out full-page adverts mocking Morrisons\u2019 Match &amp; More loyalty card. The ad focused on the many stages Morrisons shoppers needed to go through to secure the scheme\u2019s promise to match Lidl\u2019s prices. Shoppers will not have to register their details to participate in Lidl\u2019s scheme, which will begin with a promise of \u00a35 off if cardholders spend at least \u00a325 in store over two weeks. The company said the initiative would run for 10 weeks with different promotions \u2013 such as discounts on particular products \u2013 launched every week after the first fortnight. Lidl, which has about 620 stores in England, Scotland and Wales, said the smarter shopping card was not a loyalty card as it did not rely on building up points over time and the grocer would not be collecting data on shoppers or asking for contact information. \u201cThis is very very straightforward and very simple,\u201d said a Lidl spokeswoman. The company said the response from customers to the card, which launched quietly on Monday, had been \u201cphenomenal\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s an innovative way to reward our existing customer base as well as encourage new customers to try us as a supermarket that they can do their main weekly shop with,\u201d said Lidl. But analysts said the scheme \u2013 a world first for German-based Lidl \u2013 reflected a market that was becoming increasingly tough for discounters. Andrew Stevens, a retail analyst at Verdict, said Lidl\u2019s move was a sign of tougher times for the discounters now that the major supermarket chains had invested heavily in cutting prices. He said consumers were likely to feel less inclined to shop around for bargains now that they had more disposable income. \u201c[The retailers] are under quite a lot more pressure than they have been,\u201d he said. \u201cPreviously they had to just sit there but now they have to try harder to win shoppers over.\u201d Lidl\u2019s sales rose by 11.3% in the 12 weeks to 19 July, according to market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. That pace of growth is some distance ahead of the grocery market as a whole, which rose just 0.8%, and well ahead of the major supermarkets, all of which lost sales over the period. The pace of growth at Lidl and its fellow discounter Aldi is partly being driven by opening lots of stores, unlike their bigger rivals, many of which have closed outlets. The two chains have nevertheless seen the pace of growth slip back \u2013 Lidl\u2019s sales were rising by about 20% a year ago and Aldi\u2019s by more than 30%. Stevens said Lidl\u2019s scheme was likely to be low cost, because it did not have to invest in IT to enable it to collect and process data on shoppers, but would enable it to judge the potential of a longer-lasting loyalty programme. He added: \u201cThe typical Lidl shopper would probably rather have consistently low prices.\u201d Lidl said there were no plans to extend the scheme outside Scotland or beyond the 10-week trial. \u201cObviously we are going to look at this promotion and once we have evaluated it there could be discussions about [further rollout],\u201d Lidl said. Rival grocery chains employ a variety of promotional schemes to win over shoppers. The Nectar scheme used by Sainsbury\u2019s, and Tesco\u2019s Clubcard both rely on collecting points relating to the amount customers spend. Match &amp; More points relate to the amount cardholders could have saved by shopping elsewhere. The MyWaitrose card carries perks including free coffee and 20% off shoppers\u2019 10 favourite items.",

    "webTitle": "Greek elections won't derail bailout, says EU, as Syriza splits - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It has been a traumatic day - and indeed week - for global stock markets, and investors shied away from shares amid growing fears about the outlook for the Chinese economy. These worries accelerated after poor manufacturing data from the world\u2019s second biggest economy. Meanwhile there is also uncertainty about the timing of a US rate rise, and if there\u2019s one thing markets hate it is uncertainty. Slower than expected US manufacturing growth did little to clarify the picture. And then there was Greece. A day after Alexis Tsipras resigned as prime minister and called new elections, a couple of dozen members of the Syriza party broke away to form a new party they called Popular Unity. Party leader Panagiotis Lafazanis immediately held a press conference and said the breakaway group would campaign on an anti-bailout ticket. However the European Commission said it wasn\u2019t surprised aboutAlexis Tsipras\u2019s decision to resign last night, and insisted the snap elections wouldn\u2019t hold up the task of implementing sweeping reforms in Greece. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again on Monday. Back with Greece: Former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has said he would not be on the Syriza ticket in the forthcoming elections, maintaining \u201cwe betrayed the majority of the Greek people.\u201d A Greek Reporter story has the comments, made in an interview with French magazine Nouvel Observateur just before Alexis Tsipras called the new ballot: Varoufakis [said] that \u201che will not be a candidate of a party that would aim to implement the July 13 decision, even if this party has wide acceptance among Greek people.\u201d The former Finance Minister said he opposed the decision Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras took to accept the proposals of Greece\u2019s international creditors on July 13. According to Varoufakis, upon returning from the Euro Summit, Tsipras set a specific dilemma: Either we accept this agreement or the Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble plan for the country\u2019s exit from the euro is implemented. \u201cIt is in this dilemma that my disagreement with Alexis Tsipras lies,\u201d he said. \u201cI personally believe that the acceptance of the third Memorandum is essentially the starting point for the country\u2019s exit from the euro.\u201d Asked whether he will remain politically active, Varoufakis said that he will, whatever happens. He said that the questions of the Greek debt and austerity should be addressed on a European level. They should be addressed through the people and their representatives and not through the Eurogroup. He said there should be a European movement for more democracy in the Eurozone. Investors have been running for the hills ahead of the weekend, with leading markets all recording major falls. China\u2019s decision to devalue the yuan earlier this month set off concerns about the outlook for the world\u2019s second largest economy and sent its market sharply lower. Since then China\u2019s economic data has been poor, with disappointing manufacturing figures earlier proving the latest reason for investors to bail out. On top of that there is uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates, with this week\u2019s minutes just adding to the confusion. Worse than expected US manufacturing PMIs from Markit suggested a rate rise in September may now not happen, but markets have been unsettled by the lack of clarity. In Greece the decision by Alexis Tsipras to call elections next month has reawakened concerns about the eurozone, with possible Grexit being mentioned once more. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 180.24 points or 2.83% at 6187.65. This is the biggest daily percentage fall since 15 October and the lowest level since 15 December. Some \u00a346bn wiped off the value of top companies today alone Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.95% to 10,124.52 France\u2019s Cac closed down 3.19% at 4630.99 The Athens market ended 2.49% lower at 635.31 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 264 points or 1.55% lower. Commodities have been victims of the worries about a global slowdown amid possible oversupply. Brent crude has slid another 2.85% to $45.29 while copper has fallen seven weeks in a row. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the current state of play among major markets (and it\u2019s gloomy): Another German warning that the Greek agreement has to stand despite the forthcoming elections, this time from Jens Spahn, a deputy to finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble: The market sell-off is gathering pace. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 216 points or 1.2%, while the FTSE 100 is on course for its worst weekly performance this year, off 125 points or nearly 2%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at SpreadEx, said: Nothing really happened this afternoon to inspire the widening of losses, beyond the already sign-posted dismal US open and a weaker than expected US flat manufacturing PMI. Perhaps investors aren\u2019t too keen on carrying any risk into the weekend, with the threat of more Chinese instability constantly looming over the markets. That manufacturing miss for America merely helped cast more doubt on a September rate hike, and caps off a string of inconsistent data and mixed messages this week. The preliminary second quarter GDP next Thursday could provide the markets with a bit more clarity, but if the Chinese drag continues the figure could get lost in another wave of negative trading. European consumers may be slightly more confident according to the latest sentiment figures but they remain realistic, says ING Bank\u2019s Bert Colijn, as low oil prices vie with problems in Greece and China: Consumers in the Eurozone regained some confidence in August, after a drop in July amidst the Greek crisis (confidence up to -6.8 from -7.1 last month). The fact that the bounce back was small indicates that consumers continue to be less certain about the direction of the economy than they were in the first months of the year. As turmoil in China and Greece continues to make concerning headlines, the labour market improves only slowly and growth in the Eurozone does not accelerate as it did at the end of last year, consumers are showing some realism. That does not mean that consumers are now downbeat, they are still more confident than in 2005 and 2006, which were strong years of economic growth. Even though the global environment remains turbulent, European consumers do see moderate improvements in their personal situation and the European economy around them. The current levels of confidence indicate a continued moderate recovery of consumption. The upward trend in consumption has leveled off a little in the second quarter, which coincided with declining consumer confidence. As mentioned before though, current levels of confidence are far above long-term average and remain close to the 2007 peak. This means that growth in consumption is likely to continue in the coming months, but a continuation of the acceleration seen in the beginning of the year seems unlikely. One factor that does contribute positively to the consumption outlook is the recent drop in oil prices. Oil currently trades at $45 a barrel, pushing down prices at the pump. This means that consumers again experience a boost in spending power, which could spur consumption in the months ahead. Eurozone consumer confidence has increased slightly from July to August, but is still in negative territory. It improved from -7.1 to -6.8, according to the European Commission. The forecast was for -6.9. Markit\u2019s Tim Moore added: According to survey respondents, the strong dollar continued to put pressure on export sales and competitiveness, while heightened global economic uncertainty appeared to have dampened client spending both at home and abroad. Alongside this, manufacturers of investment goods widely cited growth headwinds from the slump in capital spending across the energy sector. Growth in US manufacturing came in lower than expected, according to an industry survey, casting fresh doubt on when the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. The Markit preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to 52.9 in August, compared to a final July reading of 53.8 and expectations of 54. This was the lowest level since October 2013. Tim Moore at Markit said: August\u2019s survey highlights a lack of growth momentum and continued weak price pressures across the US manufacturing sector, which adds some fuel to the dovish argument as policymakers weigh up tightening policy in September. This week\u2019s Fed minutes cast a little doubt on whether a September rise was on the cards, especially given that since the meeting fears of a global economic slowdown - led by weakness in China - have gained ground. Wall Street has, as expected, followed the global market sell-off and fallen sharply in early trading as fears of a slowdown in growth gain ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 170 points or 1%, with European markets also heading back down to their lows of the day. The FTSE 100 has fallen 102 points or 1.6%, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.3% and France\u2019s Cac has dropped 1.5%. In Athens the market is down 2.5%. The Dutch have joined in with the theme that the Greek bailout deal stands despite Alexis Tsipras calling a general election: The latest developments in Greece show the risks to the country\u2019s bailout agreement, says ratings agency Fitch. In a new report it said: The snap Greek general election highlights the risk that uncertainty in domestic politics and future relations with official creditors pose to the success of the country\u2019s third bailout programme... A September election would occur before the first programme review in October and may well hamper and delay the technical work and political decisions necessary for its completion. Relations with creditors appear to have improved in the run-up to the bailout agreement on 14 August. But the likely pause in legislating for reforms during the election campaign coming so soon after the agreement was concluded may rekindle or reinforce some creditors\u2019 concerns about Greece\u2019s ability to meet the programme\u2019s requirements. Opinion polls and [prime minister Alexis] Tsipras\u2019s personal popularity rating suggest that a Syriza-led coalition government of MPs and parties that have so far supported the new bailout agreement is a possible outcome. However, the election result is inherently unpredictable. It is not clear how the split within Syriza will affect the party\u2019s support (Greek media reports on Friday indicated that up to 25 Syriza MPs may join a break-away party). Election campaigning may demonstrate ambivalence rather than \u2018ownership\u2019 towards elements of the programme by the Greek authorities and electorate. We highlighted the continuing risks associated with snap elections, delayed programme reviews, and the time it will take to rebuild trust between Greece and its creditors when we upgraded Greece\u2019s sovereign rating to \u2018CCC\u2019 from \u2018CC\u2019 on 18 August... Nevertheless, a \u2018CCC\u2019 sovereign rating indicates that default on privately held bonds remains a real possibility. The full comments are here: Fitch: Early Greek Election Shows Risks to Bailout Remain High Investors should keep a very firm eye on Greece over the next few weeks, says Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at The Share Centre. Forrest cautions against assuming that Alexis Tsipras will stroll back into power when elections are held this autumn: \u201cWith the formation of a new party comprised of rebel Syriza MPs, the outcome of the election is highly uncertain. Although Tsipras remains popular, there is a possibility that the emerging government may be more left-wing and opposed to the reforms and austerity measures agreed in the bailout deal. Investors should note that this is likely to weaken the Euro and lead to further market volatility until the outcome, and the implications for Greece\u2019s economy are known.\u201d Vowing to end austerity and overturn Greece\u2019s bailout deals drove Alexis Tsipras to power in January. Now, Panagiotis Lafazanis appears to be aiming to repeat the trick this autumn. He says his left-wing Popular Unity party will offer a \u201crealistic alternative\u201d to the deal drawn up with creditors. The key goal is to cancel the memorandums and write down Greece\u2019s debt, says Lafazanis, adding that any euro exit would be \u201corderly.\u201d Popular Unity believes that Greece must make a \u2018planned exit\u2019 from the eurozone, Lafazanis continues: The head of Greece\u2019s newest political movement has swiftly challenged Alexis Tsipras, and vowed to run on an anti-bailout ticket. Panagiotis Lafazanis says that the MPs who split from Syriza to form Popular Unity will harness the energy of the No campaign, who won last month\u2019s referendum on Greece\u2019s bailout. There are also reports that four more Syriza MPs have jumped the fence, giving Popular Unity 29 members. The left-wing MPs who broke away from Syriza this morning to form the anti-austerity Popular Unity movement are holding a press conference now: It\u2019s being led by leader Panagiotis Lafazanis: I sense a trend forming. Germany\u2019s government has told reporters that it, too, wasn\u2019t shocked by Alexis Tsipras\u2019s resignation last night and doesn\u2019t expect the bailout programme to be affected. Spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters in Berlin that: \u201cThe move from Prime Minister Tsipras is not surprising. Of course the government, as well as Greece\u2019s other European partners, expects the agreements that are in this programme to be implemented,\u201d he said. Back in Athens, the leader of the right-wing New Democracy party, Vangelis Meimarakis, is meeting the left-wing parliamentary speaker, Zoe Konstantopoulou. They\u2019re discussing whether a unity government could be created, to avert elections next month. Judging by Konstantopoulou\u2019s body language, Meimarakis\u2019s mission may not be successful (parliamentary arithmetic suggests it\u2019s not really possible either) The European Commission has revealed that it wasn\u2019t surprised that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s decision to resign last night. It also insists that snap elections won\u2019t hold up the task of implementing sweeping reforms in Greece. Annika Breidthardt, EC spokesperson, just told reporters in Brussels that Commissioner president Jean-Claude Juncker has been in very regular contact with Tsipras. She refused to be drawn, though, on whether Juncker had been tipped off well in advance, even before the bailout deal was agreed. Asked about last night\u2019s drama, Breidthardt said: The Commission respects the decision of prime minister Tsipras to go to the polls swiftly. For us this was not a surprise, following the repeated phone calls between president Juncker, prime minister Tsipras and president Pavlopoulos. We expected it. The Commission considers it important that there is full backing for the stability support programme that was signed by Greece. Most opposition parties actually voted in favour of it in the Greek parliament last friday. Broad support and timely delivery of the measures contained in the programme will be necessary for its success. Breidthardt also insisted that Brussels isn\u2019t worried that the Greek bailout could be knocked off course: Reforms have been decided on by the Greek government and voted on by the parliament. They can be implemented now. Regardless of elections, reforms can now be implemented, she added. There is \u201cno need\u201d for a new political decision. So are you saying that Tsipras told Juncker well in advance that he would call elections, asks our Europe editor, Ian Traynor. This wasn\u2019t a surprise for us, we expected it. Briedthardt reiterates. August has been a month to forget for Australian cricketers touring England, and also for investors back home. The benchmark ASX200 posted a 1.3% decline today, extending its recent losses. And that leaves the index facing its worst monthly fall since the global financial crisis. Here\u2019s the full story: European stock markets are now clawing their way back from their lowest points. The bounce-back follows new manufacturing data from the eurozone, which shows output grew at a steady rate in August. Although French factories were weaker than expected, that was balanced out by strong growth in Germany. That left the eurozone manufacturing PMI unchanged at 52.4 in August, the same as in July. This graph from fastFT shows the details: The FTSE 100 has recovered from its early slide, and is now trading around 35 points lower, a drop of 0.5%. That\u2019s still its lowest level since January, having hit an eight-month low earlier. Brenda Kelly of London Capital Markets explains: The FTSE looks set to put in its worst week since mid-December of last year with futures dropping as low as 6205 prior to the open but has since recovered off these lows aided and abetted by some of the major precious metal producers who continue their rebound on the back of the surging gold price. Defensive stocks, most notably the UK supermarkets are also catching a bid in early trade. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister has accused Alexis Tsipras of acting cynically by seeking snap elections last night, on the day Greece received its first tranche of bailout money: Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr also reckons a mere election won\u2019t change Greece\u2019s obligations to its creditors: Ka\u017eim\u00edr clearly isn\u2019t chastened by the row last month, after he tweeted that Greece\u2019s tough bailout conditions were the result of the \u201cGreek Spring\u201d. The sharp selloff in Asia has pushed Hong Kong\u2019s index into bear market territory. The Hang Seng index fell 1.5% today, the sixth daily fall in a row, to close at its lowest level since May 2014. That means it has now shed 20% since its recent peak, in late April, as shares were hit by fears that the Chinese economy is weakening. Today\u2019s PMI survey, showing the biggest drop in Chinese factory activity since 2009, didn\u2019t help. According to Tim Condon, an economist at ING Group in Singapore: \u201cUncertainty about China growth is now the main swing factor in markets. Today\u2019s data reinforced the doubts about global growth.\u201d (quote via Reuters) Alexis Tsipras\u2019s resignation last night has hit the Greek stock market this morning. The index of 20 largest shares in Athens fell 2% in early trading, with bank shares down around 3%. Here\u2019s a list of the left-wing Greek MPs who have just broken away from Syriza to form their own party. It appears to be written in the Comic Sans font. Better than Wingdings, I guess. The head of Greece\u2019s largest opposition party, New Democracy, has just been handed the three-day \u201cmandate\u201d to form a new government: If Evangelos Meimarakis can\u2019t form a government, the mandate passes to the third-largest Greek party. That was going to be the extreme right-wing Golden Dawn party; now, though, it should be Popular Unity. Breaking away from the markets... there are important political developments in Greece. Twenty five far-left members of the Syriza party have just broken away to form their own party. It\u2019s called \u201cPopular Unity\u201d -- an ironic title, given the disunity within Syriza over Greece\u2019s bailout which prompted Alexis Tsipras to resign as prime minister last night. Popular Unity will be led by Panagiotis Lafazanis, the former energy minister who was sacked last month for voting against the bailout deal. It will be the third-largest group in the Athens parliament. Chinese authorities appear to have intervened to prop up the Shanghai stock market, in the last few minutes of trading: China\u2019s stock market has suffered another bad day. The Shanghai Composite index just closed, down over 4%, in a nervy selloff after factory activity fell at the fastest rare since the crisis began. Selling in May and going away would have been an excellent trading strategy this year. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has fallen more than 11% since hitting its record high in April, to hit its lowest level of 2015 this morning: The latest political turbulence in Greece is also hitting stock markets, says Augustin Eden of Accendo Markets: He blames: ....further deterioration of the Chinese growth outlook (dire manufacturing data overnight) and political turmoil in Greece that continues to hamper investor sentiment. Greek PM Tsipras officially resigned last night, with snap elections slated for 20 Sept and endorsed by the EU. Technology firm ARM Holdings is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index this morning. ARM\u2019s semiconductors are used in billions of mobile devices, so it\u2019s vulnerable to a slowdown in emerging markets such as China. And we\u2019re off! The FTSE 100 has shed 1.3% at the start of trading in the City. The index of leading blue chip shares dropped by 80 points to 6286, its lowest level since last December, in a wave of selling. Only one share is rising - gold producer Randgold. Other European markets are falling too. Italy is down 1.7%, Spain is down 1.8% and the the German Dax has lost 1.9%. A weakening global economy means less demand for energy. And that\u2019s why the price of oil has fallen by around 1% this morning. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, has dropped to $46 per barrel, the lowest since January. It\u2019s nearly time for Europe\u2019s stock markets to open. Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Norwegian financial group Nordea, sets the scene: Equity markets plunged globally. In the US, S&amp;P 500 tumbled by 2.11%, leaving the index at its lowest since February. Prices have continued to drop overnight in Asia, with e.g. China down by another 3%, and the weakness will extend into European markets this morning. Core bonds have rallied, oil prices remain in free fall, while the EUR/USD is heading higher. The pressure on emerging market currencies continues. Two factors are driving today\u2019s sell-off; China\u2019s economic slowdown, and confusion over when America\u2019s central bank will raise interest rates. Until recently, many economists had been pricing in a US rate hike next month. But some investors now believe that China\u2019s woes make that much less likely - creating fresh uncertainty. And markets don\u2019t like that at all. Angus Nicholson of IG, the City firm, explains: Global markets are in panic mode as the full scale of China\u2019s slowdown becomes clearer and the market pricing for a Fed September rate hike is unwound. Asian markets are a sea of red. Oil has fallen a further 1% in Asia trading today, and the word on everyone\u2019s lips is deflation \u2013 poison for equity markets. The phenomenal six-year bull market may finally meet its match in China-induced global deflation. The excess supply of commodities and the potential for further devaluations in the Chinese yuan not only make a Fed rate hike in September unlikely, but increasingly even put a December rate hike at risk. And here\u2019s the damage in Asia: Asian stock markets went into \u2018panic mode\u2019 today, after China\u2019s factory sector reported a sharp slowdown, writes my colleague Martin Farrer in Australia: China\u2019s factory sector shrank at its fastest pace in more than six years in August as domestic and export demand dwindled, a private survey showed, adding to worries that the world\u2019s second-largest economy may be slowing sharply and sending financial markets into a tailspin. China\u2019s surprise devaluation of the yuan and heavy selling in its stock markets in recent weeks have sparked fears that it could be at risk of a hard landing which would hammer world growth. Markets in countries whose economic fortunes are closely linked to China\u2019s growth tumbled. Japan\u2019s Nikkei average dropped more than 2% to six-week lows on Friday while the Kopsi index in South Korea fell 2.25%. Shares in Australia are having their worst month since the global financial crisis hit in October 2008. On Friday afternoon the benchmark ASX200 was down 2.2% at 5,173 points and is down 8.8% so far in August, according to broker Commsec. Here\u2019s the full story: Good morning. Global stock markets are being routed today, as fears over the strength of the global economy spook investors worldwide. Shares in Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong and beyond have been hit, as the selloff which began early this week intensified. And after a late selloff on Wall Street on Thursday night, European markets are facing heavy losses when trading begins at 8am BST. Oil is also likely to be hit. The selloff has been triggered by some particularly disappointing data from China\u2019s factory sector overnight. The flash Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) dropped to 47.1 in August, the worst reading in six years. That shows a sharp deterioration in conditions, and intensifying fears that China is slowing fast. Herald van der Linde, head of Asian equity strategy at HSBC, warns: \u201cMarkets are pricing in the worst right now.\u201d We\u2019ll also be watching events in Greece, after Alexis Tsipras resigned as prime minister last night to trigger new elections. First, though, the head of the largest opposition party gets a chance to form his own government. And the leftist bloc of Tsipras\u2019s own party could announce plans to break away today. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

China\u2019s decision to devalue the yuan earlier this month set off concerns about the outlook for the world\u2019s second largest economy and sent its market sharply lower.

That manufacturing miss for America merely helped cast more doubt on a September rate hike, and caps off a string of inconsistent data and mixed messages this week. The preliminary second quarter GDP next Thursday could provide the markets with a bit more clarity, but if the Chinese drag continues the figure could get lost in another wave of negative trading.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55d73720e4b084894f2224ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-21T14:39:48.062Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European consumers may be slightly more confident according to the latest sentiment figures but they remain realistic, says ING Bank\u2019s Bert Colijn, as low oil prices vie with problems in Greece and China: </p> <blockquote> <p>Consumers in the Eurozone regained some confidence in August, after a drop in July amidst the Greek crisis (confidence up to -6.8 from -7.1 last month). The fact that the bounce back was small indicates that consumers continue to be less certain about the direction of the economy than they were in the first months of the year. As turmoil in China and Greece continues to make concerning headlines, the labour market improves only slowly and growth in the Eurozone does not accelerate as it did at the end of last year, consumers are showing some realism. That does not mean that consumers are now downbeat, they are still more confident than in 2005 and 2006, which were strong years of economic growth. Even though the global environment remains turbulent, European consumers do see moderate improvements in their personal situation and the European economy around them.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac77bb4ea8e67c5217d5cf406b1f4747410beb28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac77bb4ea8e67c5217d5cf406b1f4747410beb28/0_0_3516_2111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Falling petrol prices set to lift consumption.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Falling petrol prices set to lift consumption.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>The current levels of confidence indicate a continued moderate recovery of consumption. The upward trend in consumption has leveled off a little in the second quarter, which coincided with declining consumer confidence. As mentioned before though, current levels of confidence are far above long-term average and remain close to the 2007 peak. This means that growth in consumption is likely to continue in the coming months, but a continuation of the acceleration seen in the beginning of the year seems unlikely. One factor that does contribute positively to the consumption outlook is the recent drop in oil prices. Oil currently trades at $45 a barrel, pushing down prices at the pump. This means that consumers again experience a boost in spending power, which could spur consumption in the months ahead.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55d731aae4b084894f222493\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-21T14:11:56.203Z\">3.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdf3ef97671dd6e080723e4c7d51db50e7208aab\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/21/1440166313412/aeee107c-69fc-4f5b-b9fe-41d5f6761e0f-460x337.png\" alt=\"European consumer confidence\" width=\"460\" height=\"337\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European consumer confidence</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: European Commission</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55d72ffee4b030434a2b0412\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-21T14:05:52.317Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Eurozone consumer confidence has increased slightly from July to August, but is still in negative territory.</strong></p> <p>It improved from -7.1 to -6.8, according to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/surveys/index_en.htm\"><strong>the European Commission</strong></a>.

Relations with creditors appear to have improved in the run-up to the bailout agreement on 14 August. But the likely pause in legislating for reforms during the election campaign coming so soon after the agreement was concluded may rekindle or reinforce some creditors\u2019 concerns about Greece\u2019s ability to meet the programme\u2019s requirements.<br></p> <p>Opinion polls and [prime minister Alexis] Tsipras\u2019s personal popularity rating suggest that a Syriza-led coalition government of MPs and parties that have so far supported the new bailout agreement is a possible outcome. However, the election result is inherently unpredictable. It is not clear how the split within Syriza will affect the party\u2019s support (Greek media reports on Friday indicated that up to 25 Syriza MPs may join a break-away party). Election campaigning may demonstrate ambivalence rather than \u2018ownership\u2019 towards elements of the programme by the Greek authorities and electorate.<br></p> <p>We highlighted the continuing risks associated with snap elections, delayed programme reviews, and the time it will take to rebuild trust between Greece and its creditors when we upgraded Greece\u2019s sovereign rating to \u2018CCC\u2019 from \u2018CC\u2019 on 18 August...<br></p> <p>Nevertheless, a \u2018CCC\u2019 sovereign rating indicates that default on privately held bonds remains a real possibility. </p> </blockquote> <p>The full comments are here:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/site/fitch-home/pressrelease?id=989767\">Fitch: Early Greek Election Shows Risks to Bailout Remain High</a></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-08-21T13:13:09.628Z\">at 2.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55d71df2e4b030434a2b03cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-21T12:50:15.703Z\">1.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"09f240ac9f9516cb4be850a9c30b9ece89715cd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09f240ac9f9516cb4be850a9c30b9ece89715cd3/954_30_2516_1510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Investors should keep a very firm eye on Greece over the next few weeks, says Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at The Share Centre.</strong></p> <p>Forrest cautions against assuming that Alexis Tsipras will stroll back into power when elections are held this autumn:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWith the formation of a new party comprised of rebel Syriza MPs, the outcome of the election is highly uncertain.</p> <p>Although Tsipras remains popular, there is a possibility that the emerging government may be more left-wing and opposed to the reforms and austerity measures agreed in the bailout deal.

      "bodyText": "It has weathered storms of controversy over sexy adverts that bordered on porn and accusations that its flamboyant founder sexually harassed his young employees, but in the end money, not sex, has proved the undoing of American Apparel. Unable to ride out a terminal collapse in sales the company warned this week it may go bankrupt within months. The clothes retailer known not just for its lurid marketing but also for making all of its disco shorts, hot pants and tank tops in the USA, warned investors this week that it won\u2019t have enough cash to \u201csustain operations for the next twelve months\u201d. Which raises \u201csubstantial doubt that we may be able to continue as a going concern\u201d. Some analysts said it was ironic that American Apparel, which has grown to operate from 260 stores in 19 countries, had reached its nadir so soon after investors succeeded in their long-fought battle to oust founder Dov Charney from the company he has led since he first hit upon the idea in his Tufts University dorm room in 1989. \u201cAfter everything this company has been through, it could be all over by October,\u201d said Howard Davidowitz, chief executive of retail consulting and investment banking firm Davidowitz &amp; Associates. \u201cThrough all the sex, and the sex scandals they survived, but now the writing is really on the wall it comes down to economics if you can\u2019t make money you won\u2019t survive.\u201d American Apparel, which is based in downtown Los Angeles, where it makes most of its products, reported a $19.4m loss in the second quarter \u2013 its 10th consecutive quarterly loss \u2013 as sales dropped 17%. Davidowitz said American Apparel has come back from the brink of collapse several times but the emergency cash injections had always been secured by the charismatic Charney. \u201cIn the past, believe it or not, it has always been him that has secured the miracle rescue package,\u201d Davidowitz said. \u201cHow he did it, I\u2019ll never know, with all the things he did \u2026 I could never figure it out, but somehow he was able to pull the rabbit out of the hat. Without him I don\u2019t think they will be able to do it.\u201d Charney, a 46-year-old Canadian, who had said he hoped American Apparel would become a heritage brand and would \u201clive beyond my lifetime\u201d, was sacked in December following an internal investigation into the latest in a string of sexual harassment allegations from employees and former staff. The allegations, which included claims that he made an 18-year-old sales clerk his \u201csex slave\u201d, became so serious and numerous that the company could no longer afford to pay for legal insurance against more expected lawsuits against him. Charney, who had conceded that he is his \u201cown worst enemy\u201d, is suing his former company for $100m in damages. American Apparel\u2019s legal costs ran to $3.6m in the last quarter alone. Under Charney, many of American Apparel\u2019s problems came down to sex \u2013 either the sexual activities he was getting up to, including masturbating eight times in the presence of a female journalist profiling him and sending explicit texts to employees, or the sexual nature of its adverts. American Apparel ads have been banned in various countries, including the UK, for being offensive and for appearing to sexualise children. Charney\u2019s line has always been that: \u201cSex is inextricably linked to fashion and apparel. It has been and always will be. And our clothing is connected to our sexual expression.\u201d However, now that he\u2019s gone, sex is off the table in the boardroom and its adverts. American Apparel\u2019s new CEO, Paula Schneider, a veteran fashion executive, has banned sex in all its forms and vowed to \u201crecast the brand in a positive, inclusive, socially inclusive light\u201d. Nicky Baird, an analyst at Retail Systems Research, said being sexy was \u201coriginally very successful for American Apparel but then turned into something icky\u201d. \u201cWhen the allegations that he was sexually inappropriate arose it turned something that was fun and exciting into something creepy,\u201d she said. Baird said it was good that American Apparel had cooled down the sex but warned that it was \u201ca bit too little too late\u201d. She said structural problems with the company were of a greater concern. \u201cIt is a company that has built itself on basics, when some of those basics moved into athleisure [the new term for athletic wear that is nice enough to wear to a bar even if you\u2019ve got no intention of going to the gym],\u201d Baird said. She said American Apparel might have been able to survive the bad publicity surrounding its ads and its founder\u2019s alleged inappropriate activities, if it had actually been able to keep up with consumers\u2019 changing demands, but in the end it hasn\u2019t done either. \u201cThere is definitely enough bad press about it,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially in an age of social media, it has a big impact \u2013 people on the street know about it.\u201d Rival brand Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has also vowed to stop hiring topless male models in an attempt to improve its image and halt a decline in sales. Does it mean sex no longer sells? \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you could universally say sex doesn\u2019t sell any more,\u201d Baird said. \u201c[But] as soon as the brand loses that genuine claim to be something fresh and representing its customers, it has got to find something else to pitch itself as, and I\u2019m not sure American Apparel has.\u201d Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD Group, said American Apparel had lost the total trust of the consumer and building that back will be hard slog. But he said the company\u2019s real problem has been taking its eye off the ball while it dealt with the fallout from Charney\u2019s antics. \u201cMy biggest concern for the company is that a slew of competitors are ready to eat its lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore they were the leaders to go after, now they are playing catch-up.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Supermarkets in Britain have slashed their petrol prices as the cost of crude oil continued to slide. Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco all announced on Friday a cut in the price of unleaded fuel by 2p, leading to predictions that motorists could soon be buying petrol on the forecourt for \u00a31 a litre. \u201cIf the conditions stay right, we could see some even lower prices in a few weeks as people return to work after the summer and the school run begins again,\u201d said Rod Dennis from motoring group RAC. \u201cAnd if Brent crude were to move to the $40 a barrel mark, the prospect of some enterprising retailers selling fuel for \u00a31 per litre will make a return,\u201d he said. Asda and other supermarkets are now selling unleaded petrol at 109.7p a litre compared with around 132p in the summer of last year. The 17% fall comes after the price of crude has more than halved over the same period. Brent North Sea oil was trading at $45.53 per barrel on Friday, down over 2% on the day, while the equivalent US crude, West Texas Intermediate, fell to a fraction above $40. American oil is now facing its longest run of weekly declines in almost 30 years, raising pressure on the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to meet and agree a cut in output to try to put a brake on further falls. The oil price is down from highs of $115 in the summer of last year due to a glut of production combined with lower-than-expected demand. New output from US shale fields, Iraq and even the North Sea has swamped the market but Opec has so far refused to cut back its production targets. The latest falls have been driven by expectations of new oil coming from a post-sanctions Iran but also from growing fears about a slump in the Chinese economy causing a global downturn. New data from Beijing showed the manufacturing sector had declined in August by its largest amount for six and a half years while the government has also unnerved traders with a surprise devaluation of the currency earlier this month. China is the world\u2019s largest oil importer and there are fears of lower crude demand in the country in the second half of the year when global oil supply is expected to rise even further. A number of new forecasts have suggested the current period of low oil prices could continue into next year and potentially as far ahead as 2018.",

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 has hit its lowest level this year after further signs of a weakening Chinese economy spooked global investors. Britain\u2019s leading share index had fallen 1.5% to 6,272 by Friday afternoon, with Wall Street opening lower as the Dow Jones industrial average fell 123.13 points, or 0.72%, to 16,867.56. The drops on both sides of the Atlantic mirrored stock markets across Asia-Pacific markets early on Friday after they went into \u201cpanic mode\u201d when further signs of a weakening Chinese economy compounded overnight losses on Wall Street and European bourses. China\u2019s factory sector shrank at its fastest pace in more than six years in August as domestic and export demand dwindled, a private survey showed, adding to worries that the world\u2019s second-largest economy may be slowing sharply and sending financial markets into a tailspin. Tony Cross, an analyst with Trustnet Direct in London, said the FTSE could be heading for its worst week this year. \u201cAs it stands, the FTSE 100 is on course to post its biggest weekly decline of the year so far and there\u2019s not a great deal on the agenda that would appear to have the ability to salvage the situation before the weekend break,\u201d he said. Connor Campbell, an analyst at Financials, also predicted fresh lows. Oil and mining stocks were \u201cdrowning in losses\u201d from the beginning of the day, he said. European shares also fell to a seven-month low on mounting concerns about China\u2019s economy. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 1% to 1,462.78 points, its lowest level since January and on course for its biggest weekly fall of the year. Germany\u2019s DAX declined 0.5%, which was some 16% below record highs reached in April. Elsewhere on Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 lost 13.94 points, or 0.68%, to 2,021.79 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 76.26 points, or 1.56 percent, to 4,801.23. China\u2019s surprise devaluation of the yuan and heavy selling in its stock markets in recent weeks have sparked fears that it could be at risk of a hard landing, which would hammer world growth. Markets in countries whose economic fortunes are closely linked to China\u2019s growth tumbled. Japan\u2019s Nikkei average dropped almost 3% to six-week lows on Friday, while the Kopsi index in South Korea fell 1.92%. \u201cGlobal markets are in panic mode as the full scale of China\u2019s slowdown becomes clearer,\u201d said Angus Nicholson at IG Markets in Sydney. The long-awaited interest rate rise by the US federal reserve, pencilled in for as early as September by many analysts, was now looking much less likely, Nicholson said. \u201cThe potential for further devaluations in the Chinese yuan not only make a US rate hike in September unlikely, but increasingly even put a December rate hike at risk.\u201d The Hang Seng stock index in Hong Kong was down 1.92% while the Shanghai Composite index was 4.2% lower. Commodities also suffered. US crude hit fresh six-and-a-half year lows near $40 a barrel as it headed for its eighth straight weekly decline, the longest weekly losing streak since 1986. Brent crude for October delivery was down more than 1% at $46.02 by lunchtime in London. Shares in Australia are having their worst month since the global financial crisis hit in October 2008. The benchmark ASX200 closed down 1.4% at 5,214 points, taking the loss for August so far to 8.5%, according to broker Commsec. The Australian dollar was also hammered, falling 0.45% and went as low as US72.85c. The Aussie, which is seen as a proxy for the Chinese economy, has fallen about 1% in the past week. Japan\u2019s economics minister, Akira Amari, said on Friday he expected China\u2019s government to take steps to prevent its economic slowdown from becoming a global problem. The preliminary Caixin/Markit China manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) stood at 47.1 in August, well below economists\u2019 expectations of 47.7 and down from July\u2019s final 47.8. The reading was the worst since March 2009, the depths of the global financial crisis, and the sixth straight one below the 50-point level, which separates growth in activity from contraction on a monthly basis. The flash PMI, the earliest economic measure to be released about China each month, is closely followed by global investors for clues on the health of the economy. \u201cThe poor number confirms what higher frequency data has been suggesting, that more weakness in the economy is likely,\u201d said Chester Liaw, an economist at Forecast in Singapore. He added: \u201cThe authorities claimed that there will be a rebound in demand in the second half but it appears that the opposite is happening. With first half GDP scraping the bottom of the barrel at 7%, the authorities will have a fight on their hands to ensure that the second half of the year comes in at even the same level.\u201d A detailed breakdown of the activity survey showed conditions were deteriorating on almost every level, with factory output sinking to a near four-year low, domestic and export orders declining at a faster rate than in July and companies laid off more workers. US Federal Reserve policymakers discussed China, Greece\u2019s debt crisis and the weak state of the global economy at their last meeting in July, according to minutes of the meeting released this week. US stock futures fell sharply after the PMI report and most Asian stock markets and the Australian dollar extended early losses. Overnight on Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 sank to a more than six-month low on concerns about how China\u2019s slowdown would impact US firms\u2019 earnings and global growth.",

    "webTitle": "UK income tax receipts reach surplus in July", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A record month for income tax receipts helped the government achieve its first July surplus on the public finances for three years, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics said there was a surplus of \u00a31.3bn last month for the public sector, excluding the financial impact of state-controlled banks. That was in line with City expectations and compared with a small deficit of \u00a3100m in July last year. It was the first time since 2012 that government receipts exceeded outgoings in July. The continued improvement in the public finances last month left Chancellor George Osborne on track to meet a forecast for a smaller deficit this financial year, made by the fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). \u201c[Friday\u2019s] data confirmed the improving trend in the public finances and suggests that the government could be on track to reduce the budget deficit this year by somewhat more than the OBR forecast in July,\u201d said John Hawksworth, chief economist at consultancy PwC. Against the backdrop of a pick-up in employment and earnings this year, there was a boost to the public coffers from income tax receipts in July. The ONS said income tax receipts of \u00a318.5bn were the strongest for a July since records began in 1997 and compared with \u00a317.6bn a year earlier. Public finances traditionally record a surplus in July, but tepid wage growth in the previous two years has depressed the usual surge in payments from individuals filing self-assessed income tax returns. The figures were welcomed by Osborne, who has pledged to cut and eventually eliminate the deficit \u2013 the gap between government spending and income \u2013 in order to bring down Britain\u2019s stock of outstanding debt. That stood at \u00a31.5tn in July, equivalent to 80.8% of GDP, and was \u00a373bn higher than a year earlier. The chancellor said the latest figures were testimony to the economic recovery but that the government would continue to work on cutting Britain\u2019s deficit. \u201cWith debt over 80% of GDP the job is not done,\u201d he said. For the financial year so far the deficit was \u00a324bn, down \u00a37.3bn, or 23%, from the same April to July period a year ago. Osborne said in his summer budget last month that he wanted to bring down the deficit for the whole of this financial year and the OBR has forecast it will come in at \u00a369.5bn. Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said it was too early in the financial year to conclude that \u201cthe second phase of the fiscal squeeze is going to plan. There are eight months of the fiscal year to go and revisions to estimates of borrowing in the early months of the year are often large. Accordingly, it is too soon to conclude that the chancellor is meeting his fiscal plans with room to spare and could therefore reduce the scale of the austerity measures set to hit the economy,\u201d he said. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said Osborne could beat his deficit target for this year. But Kern was cautious about the longer-term and Britain\u2019s struggle to shake off the legacy of the financial crisis. \u201cThe ability of Britain\u2019s banking sector to generate profits and tax receipts was hit hard during the recession, and together with much lower oil and gas receipts means that the country\u2019s ability to generate tax revenue is seriously reduced,\u201d Kern said. \u201cThe progress made this year in cutting the deficit provides the chancellor with greater flexibility, which will enable him to put more emphasis on ways to boost economic growth. This must include investing in infrastructure and boosting exports.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A record month for income tax receipts helped the government achieve its first July surplus on the public finances for three years, according to official figures.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said there was a <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/psa/public-sector-finances/july-2015/stb-july-2015.html\">surplus of \u00a31.3bn last month</a> for the public sector, excluding the financial impact of state-controlled banks. That was in line with City expectations and compared with a small deficit of \u00a3100m in July last year. </p> <p>It was the first time since 2012 that government receipts exceeded outgoings in July. The continued improvement in the public finances last month left Chancellor George Osborne on track to meet a forecast for a smaller deficit this financial year, made by the fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).<br></p> <p>\u201c[Friday\u2019s] data confirmed the improving trend in the public finances and suggests that the government could be on track to reduce the budget deficit this year by somewhat more than the OBR forecast in July,\u201d said John Hawksworth, chief economist at consultancy PwC.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of a pick-up in employment and earnings this year, there was a boost to the public coffers from income tax receipts in July. The ONS said income tax receipts of \u00a318.5bn were the strongest for a July since records began in 1997 and compared with \u00a317.6bn a year earlier. Public finances traditionally record a surplus in July, but tepid wage growth in the previous two years has depressed the usual surge in payments from individuals filing self-assessed income tax returns. </p> <p>The figures were welcomed by Osborne, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/10/george-osborne-public-finances-victorian-values\">has pledged to cut and eventually eliminate the deficit</a> \u2013 the gap between government spending and income \u2013 in order to bring down Britain\u2019s stock of outstanding debt. That stood at \u00a31.5tn in July, equivalent to 80.8% of GDP, and was \u00a373bn higher than a year earlier.</p> <p>The chancellor said the latest figures were testimony to the economic recovery but that the government would continue to work on cutting Britain\u2019s deficit. \u201cWith debt over 80% of GDP the job is not done,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hmtreasury/statuses/634646773164830721\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Read the Chancellor, George Osborne&#39;s response to today&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ONS\">@ONS</a> Public Sector Finances: <a href=\"http://t.co/Jya5EAmQuS\">pic.twitter.com/Jya5EAmQuS</a></p>&mdash; HM Treasury (@hmtreasury) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hmtreasury/status/634646773164830721\">August 21, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>For the financial year so far the deficit was \u00a324bn, down \u00a37.3bn, or 23%, from the same April to July period a year ago. Osborne said in his <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/summer-budget-2015/summer-budget-2015\">summer budget</a> last month that he wanted to bring down the deficit for the whole of this financial year and the OBR has forecast it will come in at \u00a369.5bn.<br></p> <p>Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said it was too early in the financial year to conclude that \u201cthe second phase of the fiscal squeeze is going to plan. There are eight months of the fiscal year to go and revisions to estimates of borrowing in the early months of the year are often large. Accordingly, it is too soon to conclude that the chancellor is meeting his fiscal plans with room to spare and could therefore reduce the scale of the austerity measures set to hit the economy,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/18/tax-receipts-from-north-sea-oil-predicted-to-fall-to-40-year-low\">Tax receipts from North Sea oil predicted to fall to 40-year low</a> </p> </aside>  <p>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said Osborne could beat his deficit target for this year. But Kern was cautious about the longer-term and Britain\u2019s struggle to shake off the legacy of the financial crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe ability of Britain\u2019s banking sector to generate profits and tax receipts was hit hard during the recession, and together with much lower oil and gas receipts means that the country\u2019s ability to generate tax revenue is seriously reduced,\u201d Kern said.</p> <p>\u201cThe progress made this year in cutting the deficit provides the chancellor with greater flexibility, which will enable him to put more emphasis on ways to boost economic growth. This must include investing in infrastructure and boosting exports.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Spire Healthcare, the independent hospital group, has slumped 13% after it warned of a slowdown in business for the National Health Service and cut growth forecasts. The company said the suspension of penalties for lengthening waiting lists at the NHS - announced earlier this month - meant there was less urgency in outsourcing to the private sector. Some trusts will financing problems were also sending patients to the NHS rather than private firms. It said: At least in the immediate short term there is likely to be a slowing in the growth rate of Spire\u2019s NHS business. Our previous guidance of \u2018low double digit\u2019 growth envisaged stronger growth in the first half (our first half NHS revenue actually grew at 16.2%) following by single digit growth (against strong comparatives) in the second half. We now expect flat NHS revenues in the second half. It said growth for the year was forecast to be 4% to 6%, compared to earlier predictions of mid to high single digit rises. It remained positive about the medium term and said its private medical insurance and self-pay businesses continued to grow. The warning on the NHS came alongside news that first half underlying earnings had climbed 8% to \u00a383.4m. The shares, which floated at 210p just over a year ago, have dropped 51.6p to 350p on the news. But there is some support from the fact that South African private hospital group Mediclinic International took a 29.9% stake earlier this year. Analysts at Investec said: First half results were weaker than we anticipated, with NHS revenue growth falling short of the 20% growth we expected from the unwinding of pre-election waiting lists. Private medical insurance revenues declined versus a strong prior year, but self-pay growth was good. With more NHS volumes expected to remain in the public sector in the first half, to address hospital deficits, Spire is downgrading 2015 revenue and EBITDA guidance. Management are now guiding to sales and EBITDA growth of 4-6%, from mid-high single digit growth previously, which implies around 3% downgrades to our sales and EBITDA estimates. Valuation remains underpinned by Mediclinic\u2019s recent investment (29.9% stake) and expectations of a complete takeover at some point in the future, but we expect the shares to be weak today. We put our estimates and target price under review. Numis said: While this recent NHS development creates near term uncertainty, we note that NHS waiting lists are at the highest level seen since February 2008, which we would expect to drive self-pay markets and expect Spire to continue to benefit from its high quality and transparent pricing model.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "America\u2019s oil boom is faltering, and with US crude oil prices hitting lows unseen since 2009 this week, experts believe the fall may continue taking thousands of jobs with it. Consumers may cheer the lower prices at the pump, but jobs are being lost in the energy industry across the world. In June, the Energy Information Administration said the US petroleum industry lost about 6.5% of its jobs from October to April, or about 35,000 of its 538,000 workers, citing US Bureau of Labor Statistics data. On Wednesday, Royal Dutch Shell said it would eliminate 6,500 jobs worldwide as the company tries to reduce costs because of the lower oil prices. Declines in oil and natural gas extraction and support employment tend to lag declines in crude oil prices, so given the recent return to lower prices, more job cuts could be on the way. Global stock markets have been rattled by the fall and continuing woes in China. The Dow Jones Industrial average hit a low for 2015 on Thursday and is expected to come under renewed pressure on Friday. \u201cGlobally there\u2019s probably been approaching a quarter-million layoffs from the oil industry. And hundreds and billions in cancelled projects,\u201d said Walter Zimmermann Jr, vice president and chief technical analyst at United-ICAP. \u201cHouston is getting hit especially hard. You go to Houston and nobody talks about the economic benefit of lower oil prices. And certainly no one is talking about that in the Bakken Field [North Dakota].\u201d So far, he added, the impact on consumers is limited. \u201cThe problem is when people think of consumers saving a few pennies at the pump, they\u2019re not going to take that money and buy a new house or a new car or send their child to college. They\u2019re probably going to buy extra socks and potatoes,\u201d Zimmermann said. The boom that started in 2008 when oil prices reached nearly $150 a barrel \u2013 high enough to make new fracking technology affordable. All that fracking oil has contributed to a glut and the inevitable boom and bust cycle has come full circle again. But the price is also being hit by the jitters affecting financial markets overall, such as the stronger US dollar, general weakness in commodity prices, fears about China\u2019s economy and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve\u2019s possible interest-rate hike. On Wednesday, US futures prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil, the US benchmark, settled at $40.80 a barrel, the lowest since March 2009, while Brent prices closed at $46.90. Prices are slightly higher Thursday. Demand isn\u2019t all that bad. International Energy Agency raised its global oil-demand forecast by 1.6m barrels daily, the fastest pace in five years. But supply is overwhelming use. Although the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries has a production quota of 30m barrels a day June, the cartel said on 11 August in its monthly oil market report that it pumped an average of 31.5m barrels a day in July, the most in three years. US supplies are stout, too. On Wednesday the Energy Information Administration surprised market participants when it said supplies rose 2.62m barrels to 456.21m barrels last week, the highest inventory levels in 80 years. Traders had expected a drop in supplies. \u201cNews on the supply side gets worse each passing day,\u201d said Bill O\u2019Neill, one of the principals with LOGIC Advisors. There could be further supply problems down the road. If the Iran nuclear deal is passed, it will allow the Middle East nation to start shipping oil, possibly as much as one million barrels a day, said Commerzbank in a research note. However, Iranian oil won\u2019t come online immediately since it will take time to restart operations. Commerzbank sees Iranian oil output at a maximum of 500,000 barrels per day until year-end and by another 500,000 barrels per day next year. Dan Heckman, national investment consultant for US Bank Wealth Management, said China\u2019s moves to shore up its recent problems also affected oil. China is a major consumer of most commodities and its actions have great impacts on the sector. \u201cChina sent a major shockwave through this market and others as well when the devaluated the currency. One, [it was] a surprise move which markets never like, and two, people started to realize perhaps their economic issues are worse than people realize,\u201d he said. As far as where prices may go from here, for now the direction points down. O\u2019Neill said his firm has held a target price of $39 for WTI, adding that prices still could drift lower. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be anything on the immediate horizon to turn things around,\u201d he said. Some energy-market watchers have predicted prices could get as low as $10 or $15. Zimmermann said those extreme calls might be a sign that crude-oil prices are reaching a bottom. He said when oil prices reached nearly $150 in July 2008 there were similar calls for oil to hit $250. Instead it fell to about $34 at year\u2019s end during the financial crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re entering the general timing window of a 15-year cycle low,\u201d he said.",

Instead it fell to about $34 at year\u2019s end during the financial crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re entering the general timing window of a 15-year cycle low,\u201d he said.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Why is it, Eileen Burbidge asks, that girls at primary school are required to wear skirts and play netball rather than wear shorts and play football. \u201cAt seven years old, what are you saying to the children at that age?\u201d asked Burbidge, a newly appointed member of David Cameron\u2019s business advisory panel. A key investor in companies at the forefront of financial innovation, Burbidge is concerned that gender stereotyping is a real problem. But despite a recent controversy over diversity in Silicon Valley, she does not feel being a woman in her industry has held her back. \u201cThe tech industry as a sector has been good for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI might benefit from other sterotypes \u2026 in general being a women hasn\u2019t been to my detriment. \u201cI do feel the tech sector is much more meritirocatic [than other sectors] ... People underestimate women in tech at their own peril.\u201d After graduating in computer science from the University of Illinois in the early 1990s, Burbidge ended up in Silicon Valley where she worked at some of the biggest tech names, such as Apple and Sun. Then she came to the UK for what she thought would be a short stint. Ten years on, she has not returned to her native America and is spearheading part of George Osborne\u2019s drive to improve the productivity of UK plc. In last month\u2019s productivity plan, the chancellor set out his ambition to make the UK the leading centre for financial innovation in the world and named her special envoy for Fintech \u2013 the branch of the technology sector bidding to revolutionise financial services, from mobile banking and money transfers to fundraising and even asset management. As part of the plan Osborne intends to launch a benchmarking exercise in the autumn to establish where the UK lies in the world league. Meanwhile, from a trendy, loft-like office space in Clerkenwell, central London, Burbidge and her two partners at Passion Capital have become one of the go-to destinations for entrepreneurs looking for finance for businesses in the earliest stages of development. Can the UK really take on the might of Silicon Valley? Burbidge has no hesitation. \u201cWith regards to fintech, I don\u2019t merely think the UK can \u2018take on\u2019 Silicon Valley. I know for certain that we can lead it and the rest of the world \u2013 and that we are in fact already doing so. There is no question that most technology innovation in financial services is coming from London.\u201d The online jobs agency Adzuna and the car enthusiasts\u2019 website CarThrottle have both been backed by Passion, which was established in 2009 and has launched two funds which have received \u00a343m of taxpayers\u2019 money through the British Business Bank. \u201cYour tax money at work\u201d is how she put it, saying it is being invested \u201cprincipally for the benefit of the UK economy\u201d. Additional investment money from wealthy individuals takes both funds to \u00a383m in total. The chancellor\u2019s ambition to challenge Silicon Valley follows the Tech City initiative launched by the coalition in 2010. Even before that, the term Silicon Roundabout had been coined as the name for the Shoreditch area in east London where dotcom startups were basing their operations. Several factors work in Britain\u2019s favour, Burbidge says: the regulatory environment, the UK\u2019s banking heritage, and the time zone \u2013 between Hong Kong to the east and the US, and Silicon Valley, to the west. More broadly, she says: \u201cI\u2019m certain that the UK can take on Silicon Valley and don\u2019t even like phrasing it that way as I feel that ambition is too low given our potential. \u201cWe have all the ingredients for success here in the UK and are now also slowly experiencing a cultural shift which brings respect and support for ambition and entrepreneurship in our society,\u201d she says. Burbidge has not lost her American accent, but she nevertheless talks about \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d when discussing the UK. Britain is now her home. In the Queen\u2019s birthday honours she received an MBE for services to business. In the run-up to the election she signed a letter published in the Guardian backing the Conservatives. \u201cNow that I do have citizenship, four kids that are British and going to go through school from here ... I genuinely now am invested personally and of course professionally in the country,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like footballers, you want to play in the top league.\u201d Her first taste of investing came through Ambient Sound Investments, the vehicle set up by the Estonian engineers behind Skype to invest their proceeds from the ill-fated $2.6bn sale to eBay. Her first role in the UK was as one of five employees in London with the video chat service, although she was fired before the eBay deal went through. Eventually, she ended up at Passion with her two partners, Stefan Glaenzer, who founded the German auction site ricardo.de which was sold to rival qxl.com, and Robert Dighero, qxl\u2019s former finance director. They are backing businesses in their very early stages. Performance figures for the first fund, which has invested in 42 companies, show the value of the businesses has risen more than three times since the initial investment \u2013 although with subsequent rounds of fundraising included the actual return is 1.6 times. Those figures were bolstered by the \u00a345m sale of Mendeley, an academic social website, to Reed Elsevier in 2013. Burbidge had been an angel investor \u2013 investing her own money \u2013 before Passion stepped in. She says systems have been put in place to avoid conflicts and that she and her partners will not invest in companies that Passion is backing. Burbidge is known for her outspoken approach, operating on a golden rule that she sums up as \u201cno jerks\u201d. She explains: as an early stage investor, startups tend to come without detailed business plans to review. \u201cWe are basically investing in the people.\u201d She adds: \u201cIf you are a genuine person it is easier for you to attract great talent, it\u2019s easier for you to retain that talent and easier for you to relate to your customers ... and it makes it stronger in the long run and makes the business more scaleable so it is not just all about you. \u201cWe have some cases where the three of us \u2026 thought: \u2018Great, it\u2019s a great market and these guys will probably be the ones who will do it \u2026 so let\u2019s make this investment.\u2019 And we\u2019ve gone round the table and said: \u2018Who\u2019s taking the board seat?\u2019 and we each assume the other was going to take the board seat. And as soon as we realise none of us wants to sit on the board with these people we have changed our minds and not made the investment.\u201d Five startups to watch Digital Shadows: Passion Capital has backed this cybersecurity business, an area that Burbidge highlights for its vast opportunities given online attacks on businesses, such as Ashley Madison and Sony. She sits on the board of the startup which aims to alert companies to potential cyber threats. GoCardless: A payments system, launched in September 2011 and backed by Passion, that allows merchants to take direct debits online and avoid taking credit card payments. It is trying to crack an area dominated by huge players, such as Visa, Mastercard and PayPal. Mondo: Passion Capital set up a special \u00a32m fund just to back this banking app which is now applying for a banking licence from the Bank of England. It aims to be digital only \u2013 no branches \u2013 and the banking equivalent of Google. Onfido: Not backed by Passion, it automates the collection of necessary data for firms needing background checks on individuals. Prospective employees, for instance, enter their personal details via a web link and Onfido then conducts the necessary searches. Revelin: An online fraud protection business that is still in its early stages. Based in the offices of Passion Capital, which has invested, it uses historical data to analyse signals and patterns in transactions with a view to detecting fraud.",
