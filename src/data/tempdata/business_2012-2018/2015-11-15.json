      "bodyText": "Former HBOS bosses who are expected to be heavily criticised this week over their role in the bank\u2019s near-collapse are likely to escape fines because regulators\u2019 report into the matter took so long to complete. HBOS had to be rescued by rival Lloyds in September 2008 and the enlarged institution was later bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayers\u2019 cash. A Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority report into the debacle is to be published on Thursday after a series of delays. The former chairman, Lord Stevenson, and chief executives James Crosby and Andy Hornby are expected to be heavily criticised in the 500-page report and could face bans from the financial services industry. But fines cannot be imposed for any wrongdoing unless the report reveals significant new information, because regulators did not warn executives of any enforcement action before a six-year statute of limitations ran out last year. The main report, which reviewed more than 200,000 evidence documents, was completed 18 months ago. But regulators have spent the last year and a half dealing with more than 1,500 representations from 35 HBOS executives whom they were legally obliged to consult about comments relating to them in the report \u2013 a process known as Maxwellisation. A 100-page report by an independent QC, Andrew Green, also to be published on Thursday, will examine whether the former banking regulator, the Financial Services Authority, was right to have taken action against just one former HBOS executive. Peter Cummings, who ran the bank\u2019s commercial lending division, was banned for life from the industry and fined \u00a3500,000 in 2012. The report into the collapse of HBOS was not started until that year, once the enforcement action, and appeals against it by Cummings, had taken place, but was initially expected to be completed in 2013. The parliamentary commission on banking standards, set up in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal, has already published its own account of the collapse. It accused Crosby, Hornby and Stevenson of \u201ccolossal\u201d management failures and questioned why only Cummings had been censured by the City regulator. Hornby returned to business life in 2009 as chief executive of Alliance Boots. He is now chief operating officer of Gala Coral, and will hold the same senior role when its merger with Ladbrokes is finalised. Crosby resigned from several City positions, and asked for his knighthood to be revoked, in 2013 after the parliamentary report found that he sowed the \u201cseeds of destruction\u201d at HBOS. Paul Moore, the HBOS whistleblower, said last week he feared the report could turn out to be \u201ca cover-up and a fudge\u201d. He has called for a criminal investigation, as well as a judicial inquiry into the auditing of all the big banks and the conduct of the credit ratings agencies.",

      "bodyText": "The deadline to dispense further rescue loans to debt-stricken Greece was extended by eurozone countries once again on Sunday amid continuing deadlock between Athens and its creditors. With negotiations still bogged down over failure to agree on a new foreclosure law \u2013 legislation the leftist-led government says would push austerity-hit Greeks over the edge \u2013 lenders postponed a critical Eurogroup Working Group until Tuesday. The meeting, a final assessment of the reform progress Athens has made since it signed up to a third bailout in July, is crucial to unlocking \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.41bn) in rescue loans and \u20ac10bn for the recapitalisation of Greek banks. Finance ministers gathered in Brussels last week had insisted talks should be concluded by Monday, to trigger the release of the next instalment of the \u20ac86bn euro bailout programme. But announcing the delay, Jeroen Dijsselbloem who chairs the Eurogroup of euro area finance ministers, also heaped praise on Greece saying headway had been made. \u201cI welcome that good progress has been made between the Greek authorities and the institutions in the discussions on the measures included in the first set of milestones,\u201d the Dutch politician said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cAgreement has been reached on many issues.\u201d The Eurogroup Working Group sets the tone for decisions taken by finance ministers representing EU member states in the single currency. Talks were meant to have been completed by mid-October but have repeatedly stalled on the issue of how much protection local home-owners should be given in the event of defaulting on mortgages. Greek banks have been weighed down by a mountain of bad loans with lenders claiming that many are the result of strategic defaulters deliberately failing to keep up with payments. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government \u2013 backed by the political opposition \u2013 insist the law would hit the most vulnerable, dispossessing thousands of primary residences at a time of acute social hardship. The two sides failed to bridge their differences during marathon, 14-hour negotiations that lasted until 2am Sunday morning. Both sides described the 48-hour delay as \u201ca window of opportunity\u201d to finally settle the issue. Policymakers have voiced fears that the constant delays are chipping away at Greece\u2019s financial sustainability, with fiscal targets becoming ever more elusive. Athens\u2019 Syriza-dominated government is keen to use the \u20ac2bn loan to implement relief measures alongside painful spending cuts set as the price of receiving a third financial rescue package in five years. Recapitalisation of Greek banks is seen as a vital next step if the cash-starved economy, wracked by six years of recession, is to stay afloat. Both the EU and IMF have said they will only begin debt relief talks once the negotiations are completed and Greece is given a good progress report. With debt amounting to 180% of GDP, a write-down is an important step towards long-term economic recovery.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "European and Asian stock markets were expected to fall sharply on Monday amid fears that the terror attacks in Paris would hurt Europe\u2019s economic recovery. Financial analysts predicted that markets would be rattled by the attacks, in which 129 people died and hundreds more were injured. Middle Eastern markets have already fallen, with Saudi Arabia\u2019s main index hitting a 35-month low on Sunday. European markets are on track to shed 2% when trading begins, with the French market likely to bear the brunt of the sell-off. A full-blown financial crash was not expected, though, with economists hopeful that the French people would remain resilient following the worst terror attack in Europe for a decade. \u201cWe are going to get off to a negative start in Asia, and then Europe will follow,\u201d said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see panic selling following the tragic events in Paris.\u201d \u201cThe tragedy has a lot of people asking questions, at a time when markets are already starting to look vulnerable after a strong October,\u201d he added. A 2% fall would wipe more than 100 points off Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, sending it down to a six-week low. Several Middle Eastern stock markets fell sharply on Sunday, with investors from Cairo to Dubai selling shares following Friday\u2019s attacks. The benchmark Saudi index, or Tadawul, shed almost 3% to its lowest level since the first trading day of 2013. Traders said falling oil prices last week had helped to push shares down, reflecting fears that the global economy is weakening. Egypt\u2019s main index, the EGX 30, tumbled by over 4%. The United Arab Emirates\u2019 market shed 3.6% with many stocks suspended after slumping 10%, the daily limit. The Paris stock market was scheduled to open as normal on Monday, despite the co-ordinated attacks across the capital on Friday night. Yogi Dewan, the chief executive of Hassium Asset Management, also predicted that shares would fall sharply. He told Bloomberg he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised to see markets down 2% to 3%, maybe even more\u201d. \u201cSectors will be impacted in Europe such as insurance, travel and leisure,\u201d Dewan added. Economists fear that French consumer confidence will be hurt by the atrocities in Paris, hurting an economy that returned to growth this autumn after stagnating over the summer. \u201cIt is obviously likely to significantly hit the Paris economy in the near term, and there could also be a knock-on effect elsewhere in France,\u201d said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. \u201cThere could also be an adverse impact on tourism in some European countries where people think attacks are most likely to occur \u2013 not just in France.\u201d However, Archer believes France will avoid being pulled back into recession. \u201cAs horrific as these events are \u2013 and this is truly awful \u2013 economic activity does tend to be pretty resilient. The UK, Spain and France itself has all seen its economies little damaged by terrorist atrocities in the past. \u201cAt the end of the day, people have to get on with their lives. And that is the best way of putting up two fingers to the terrorists.\u201d The attacks also raise the chances that the European Central Bank will announce new stimulus measures next month, to combat fears that the eurozone could sink back into deflation. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said further action was \u201cpretty much inevitable\u201d. \u201cThe impact on consumer confidence could well be considerable, and anything that causes European consumers to retrench further is likely to be a significant concern for a European Central Bank already concerned about deflation and a lack of demand,\u201d he said.",

There are plenty of uses for the surplus funds swimming around in pension funds, sovereign wealth funds or simply languishing on company balance sheets. Hardly an economy exists that couldn\u2019t benefit from more investment, whether on infrastructure or the latest manufacturing processes. Yet seven years after the crash the funds are frozen in cash accounts, lent to safe-haven countries or diverted into speculative betting on currency fluctuations, junk bond futures and the price of oil in a year or two. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell held the first meeting of his economic advisory group last week to consider a way of breaking the logjam. The consensus view around the table was that the government needs to step in and take its proper role alongside the private sector to spur investment. If confidence is the issue, according to the Keynesian storybook, then the government can at least provide a backbone of solid, long-term investment that gives everyone a belief in the future of UK plc. There is plenty of evidence that without the sustained commitment of public sector funds, innovation dies. Free marketeers can point to car manufacturing and other consumer durable industries as bastions of long-term private investment, but the hard stuff, like healthcare, transport infrastructure, energy, affordable housing and promoting the digital economy, need a public/private partnership at the very least. McDonnell\u2019s problems, and those of Ed Balls before him, are twofold. There is very little trust among the electorate in public sector bodies to invest sensibly. The catalogue of IT failures under Labour dented the public\u2019s faith. Post-war public housing, rightly or wrongly, is considered a disaster. More recently, the west coast mainline upgrade delays, botched health service reforms and dithering over airport expansion under the coalition have done little to improve the public\u2019s jaded view. These delays and cock-ups are no worse than we see in the private sector, but that doesn\u2019t seem to matter - a trust deficit persists. Then there is the funding issue. Not that there should one. Governments can borrow cheaply and speculate with some assurance that the returns to economic growth, though difficult to measure, will improve the nation\u2019s competitiveness. Again the electorate is nervous. And that is understandable when the fragility of the global recovery is writ large in headlines almost every day. How can we make multibillion-pound outlays when there could be another financial calamity around the corner?, they ask. Europe\u2019s refugee problem and the Paris terrorist attacks all fuel a sense of anxiety. The answer could be to pay cash for infrastructure improvements from tax receipts. However, the same nervousness applies, especially among an older generation who have acquired a decent income and some property and pension assets. They don\u2019t want to pay higher taxes to fund investment spending. It\u2019s one reason why only one in five voters over the age of 65 put a cross in Labour\u2019s box at the last general election. This leaves McDonnell with little room for manoeuvre, especially when the next government is likely to be overwhelmed with calls for extra spending. If nothing else, the current health crisis will be seen as merely a bitter hors d\u2019oeuvre for the indigestible dish to come. And there will be plenty of other emergencies to soak up public sector funds. That is not to say George Osborne\u2019s National Infrastructure Commission is worthless. It must be a positive thing that around \u00a3130bn will be allocated to the English regions, and more than \u00a330bn will go to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland combined under the government\u2019s infrastructure pipeline. The sums are just not enough. So what about the private sector? Thinktanks across Europe and the US have deliberated on the lack of business investment. A report by the investment bank UBS in September pointed out that over the past two years US corporations have amassed huge fortunes, only to hand them back to shareholders. Spending on share buybacks in the last two years has climbed 45% in the US, with a 21% rise in dividends. Capital expenditure, by contrast, has climbed just 11%, the report found. Corporates mainly borrowed to fund mergers and takeovers or, like Apple, to pay a shareholder dividend while the company\u2019s cash remained in a tax haven offshore. \u201cA recent survey of US loan officers showing that the main reasons for strong credit demand were mergers and acquisitions and debt refinancing: capital investment didn\u2019t even register. To put this in a broader historical context, in the 1970s American companies invested 15 times as much cash as they distributed to shareholders. Now this ratio has sunk to below two,\u201d the report added. Short-termism is not new to corporate life. For decades analysts have lamented how executives obsess about hitting quarterly targets to please shareholders and secure their bonuses. This is compounded by the shareholder\u2019s representative - the fund manager - seeking to hit their own quarterly targets. UBS, like most of its cousins in the financial community, wants the government to encourage investment with tax breaks and fewer regulations. But it also backs a growing enthusiasm for restraining corporate short-term thinking. The Paris-based thinktank, the OECD, examined the dearth of private investment earlier this year and was striking in its support for restrictions on share buybacks as a way to force company owners to invest. It recommends changing the law to \u201crestrain them directly\u201d. A government needs to step in, they argue, because no boardroom can act alone, especially when the short-term measurement of success is so ingrained in the financial system. All public companies submit to it, and do little to support reform while the personal rewards remain bountiful. So rather than a knee-jerk tax on the incomes of the rich executive class, better to tackle the source of their bonuses and share plans, built as they are on targets stretching over just two or three years at most. Without this kind of jolt, corporates will continue to take their cash, often offshore, and find tax-free ways to benefit shareholders. And investment in the long-term health of their businesses, let alone the public realm, will suffer further delay.",

    "webTitle": "Warmer autumn weather triggers coat and knitwear discounts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fashion retailers are rolling out the discounts early for the second autumn in a row after warmer than average weather hit sales of coats and knitwear. Marks &amp; Spencer is offering 20% off coats and jackets and up to 60% off selected other items, despite its efforts to cut back on discounting. Debenhams is offering up to half price on women\u2019s knitwear; Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Bhs and Oasis are all offering up to 30% discounts while New Look and French Connection are advertising 25% off many knitwear items. The discounts have kicked in a fortnight before Black Friday, when many fashion chains are expected to join in with the traditional US discount day. It comes after a poor week for fashion retailers which have already suffered from unseasonably chilly weather over the summer. Clothing chains suffered a 6.6% fall in sales in the week to 8 November compared with the same week last year, according to figures from BDO\u2019s survey of mid-sized chains. That was on top of a weak trading period a year before when sales fell 3.6%. BDO said all fashion retailers had suffered as the number of people visiting high streets and shopping centres fell. The mild temperatures also contributed to a 0.6% fall in fashion sales at John Lewis in the week to 7 November, particularly in cold-weather gear, coats and jackets. The figure was partly affected by strong sales in the previous week when John Lewis was price-matching against a promotional event at House of Fraser. \u201cThere is a sense that retailers have managed their stocks more efficiently this year but with like-for-like numbers struggling, they will no doubt be considering their promotional activity as Black Friday looms and the savvy consumer holds out for stronger promotions,\u201d said Sophie Michael, national head of retail at BDO. She said she expected promotions to be more selective than \u201cblanket\u201d. On Tuesday, Anders Kristiansen, the boss of New Look, said he didn\u2019t think this year\u2019s warmer weather was affecting sales. \u201cAlthough it is warm now, in September we had an early cold spell and that helped change people\u2019s mindset to buying outerwear and knitwear.\u201d He said that did not happen last year, when retailers were forced to discount heavily to clear stock after an unseasonably warm autumn. However, a number of other fashion executives told the Guardian that trading was disappointing, particularly in comparison with last year\u2019s weak figures with stocks of cold weather gear building up. \u201cThe levels of discounting so far this season have been lower than in the previous three years, but we expect activity on the high street to step up in the next 10 days to two weeks unless the weather changes and there is a cold snap,\u201d said one retailer. The chance of that cold snap emerging is not promising, despite storm Abigail bringing heavy rains and high winds over the weekend. The Met Office is predicting day to day variations in the temperature, with milder, wetter spells interspersed with colder, showery spells, in the next two weeks. Its forecast predicts: \u201cOverall [temperatures] should average out at near or slightly above normal for the time of year.\u201d In October the UK mean temperature was 10C, 0.5C above the long-term average but the temperature hit a high point of 22.7C in Braemar, Aberdeenshire. It was also the driest month since October 2007 with locations in the west and north with less than a third of average rainfall in a few locations. Overall the UK overall received only 57% of average rainfall. Tony Shiret, an analyst at Haitong Research, said that poor sales in October and early November made it difficult for clothing chains to clear their coats and jumpers. \u201cThey are going to be sitting around with excess inventory in the run-up to Christmas and if you give people a taste of discount they are just going to wait for the big sales kick. \u201cI\u2019m working on the assumption that the whole season is going to be spoilt by markdowns and overhanging stock against an incredibly weak season last year. \u201cWhat is more difficult to judge is how much the current trade also reflects the continuing switch from shops to online. That is much more of an issue structurally.\u201d",

Debenhams is offering up to half price on women\u2019s knitwear; Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Bhs and Oasis are all offering up to 30% discounts while New Look and French Connection are advertising 25% off many knitwear items.</p> <p>The discounts have kicked in a fortnight before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/black-friday\">Black Friday</a>, when many fashion chains are expected to join in with the traditional US discount day. </p> <p>It comes after a poor week for fashion retailers which have already suffered from unseasonably chilly weather over the summer. </p> <p>Clothing chains suffered a 6.6% fall in sales in the week to 8 November compared with the same week last year, according to figures from BDO\u2019s survey of mid-sized chains. That was on top of a weak trading period a year before when sales fell 3.6%. </p> <p>BDO said all fashion retailers had suffered as the number of people visiting high streets and shopping centres fell.</p> <p>The mild temperatures also contributed to a 0.6% fall in fashion sales at John Lewis in the week to 7 November, particularly in cold-weather gear, coats and jackets. The figure was partly affected by strong sales in the previous week when John Lewis was price-matching against a promotional event at House of Fraser.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a sense that retailers have managed their stocks more efficiently this year but with like-for-like numbers struggling, they will no doubt be considering their promotional activity as Black Friday looms and the savvy consumer holds out for stronger promotions,\u201d said Sophie Michael, national head of retail at BDO. She said she expected promotions to be more selective than \u201cblanket\u201d.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Anders Kristiansen, the boss of New Look, said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/10/new-look-to-open-20-menswear-stores-as-expansion-gathers-pace\">he didn\u2019t think this year\u2019s warmer weather was affecting sales</a>. \u201cAlthough it is warm now, in September we had an early cold spell and that helped change people\u2019s mindset to buying outerwear and knitwear.\u201d</p> <p>He said that did not happen last year, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/26/winter-fashion-warm-weather-high-street-discounts\">retailers were forced to discount heavily to clear stock after an unseasonably warm autumn</a>.</p> <p>However, a number of other fashion executives told the Guardian that trading was disappointing, particularly in comparison with last year\u2019s weak figures with stocks of cold weather gear building up.</p> <p>\u201cThe levels of discounting so far this season have been lower than in the previous three years, but we expect activity on the high street to step up in the next 10 days to two weeks unless the weather changes and there is a cold snap,\u201d said one retailer.</p> <p>The chance of that cold snap emerging is not promising, despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/13/heavy-rain-warning-for-northern-britain-in-wake-of-storm-abigail\">storm Abigail bringing heavy rains and high winds over the weekend</a>.</p> <p>The Met Office is predicting day to day variations in the temperature, with milder, wetter spells interspersed with colder, showery spells, in the next two weeks. Its forecast predicts: \u201cOverall [temperatures] should average out at near or slightly above normal for the time of year.\u201d</p> <p>In October the UK mean temperature was 10C, 0.5C above the long-term average but the temperature hit a high point of 22.7C in Braemar, Aberdeenshire. It was also the driest month since October 2007 with locations in the west and north with less than a third of average rainfall in a few locations. Overall the UK overall received only 57% of average rainfall.</p> <p>Tony Shiret, an analyst at Haitong Research, said that poor sales in October and early November made it difficult for clothing chains to clear their coats and jumpers.</p> <p>\u201cThey are going to be sitting around with excess inventory in the run-up to Christmas and if you give people a taste of discount they are just going to wait for the big sales kick.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m working on the assumption that the whole season is going to be spoilt by markdowns and overhanging stock against an incredibly weak season last year.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is more difficult to judge is how much the current trade also reflects the continuing switch from shops to online. That is much more of an issue structurally.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Star Wars: The Force Awakens opens next month, and is sure to put an exclamation point on what has been the year of the mega-movie. Next year \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 looks even bigger. Fueled by a combination of hugely popular franchises like The Avengers and Jurassic Park, and big animated hits such as Inside Out, 2015 is on track to be a record year for Hollywood. Paul Dergarabedian, a senior analyst at media measurement firm Rentrak, estimates the domestic box office this year will top $11bn (a 5% gain), while globally it could hit the $40bn mark. \u201cThat\u2019s impressive considering all the competition out there for audiences being pulled in myriad directions by content on the small screen and on various platforms,\u201d he said. That intensifying competition \u2013 from all kinds of entertainment options including Netflix and HBO, to PlayStation, to video increasingly on Facebook and other apps \u2013 is forcing the major studios more than ever to deliver the big-budget spectacles that drive audiences into theaters. Another key factor is the growing importance of reaching international audiences as box office growth in the US flattens out. Jurassic World showed the way this summer as the fastest film to gross $1bn worldwide \u2013 hitting the milestone in 13 days. That all points to a greater reliance on high-profile franchises, more likely to generate returns on the hefty investments required to make blockbuster movies. Consider that seven of the top 10 highest-grossing films this year are sequels or part of well-known franchises. The bigger is better movement has had a disastrous impact on smaller, independent movies. Independent movies failed to score a breakout hit this summer and studios\u2019 obsession with the mega-movie is likely to mean less time and money for smaller productions. \u201cI am big. It\u2019s the pictures that got small,\u201d Norma Desmond railed in Sunset Boulevard. How wrong she was. No company highlights the focus on mega properties better than Walt Disney, where executives often refer to its \u201ctentpole strategy\u201d for feature films. A prime example of that approach is its Marvel franchise, whose films have averaged $820m in global box office receipts to date, according to Disney. The latest, Avengers: Age of Ultron, is approaching $1.5bn at the worldwide box office. With the $4bn acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, the media giant snapped up the prized Star Wars franchise to go along with Marvel and its immensely successful Pixar Studio. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the volume, it\u2019s about how good the quality is. And you\u2019re going to be much better off as a company making fewer things, and concentrating on those,\u201d explained Disney\u2019s CEO, Bob Iger, speaking at an industry event last December. Disney\u2019s box office results this year suggest that less can indeed be more. The company has grossed about $1.5bn domestically from just 13 films, with four in the top 10. Universal is easily No 1, at $2.3bn, but that\u2019s from 19 films, through last weekend. Warner Bros has grossed $1.4bn from 30 films, and Fox, $1.2bn from 37, per Rentrak. In short, Disney and Universal have gotten more bang for their buck. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have 24 movies, and try by sheer volume, to generate some kind of big box office market share,\u201d noted Dergarabedian. That isn\u2019t to say Warner Bros and Fox eschew tentpoles. Hardly. But for Warner Bros, in particular, 2015 has marked a fallow stretch as its powerhouse franchises like the The Hobbit, Dark Knight and Harry Potter all but dried up. And in their place came major flops like Pan and Jupiter Ascending. Fox, meanwhile, showed with its reboot of the Fantastic Four this summer that even superhero movies aren\u2019t always a sure bet. Its poor performance contributed to parent company 21st Century Fox missing analysts\u2019 revenue estimate for the quarter ending 30 September. Fox\u2019s film division overall reported revenue of $1.79bn, down 28% from a year ago, while its profit fell by two-thirds to $149m. But the flameout of the Fantastic Four, which took in only $56m domestically, hasn\u2019t discouraged Fox from thinking big. Along with Warner Bros, it is banking on a return to the franchise formula in 2016. The most widely anticipated release in that regard is Warner Bros\u2019 Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, set to open in March. The film will kick off the studio\u2019s planned release of 10 DC Comics-based titles over the next five years, featuring other superheroes like Wonder Woman, The Flash, and Aquaman. Next year will also see Warner Bros try to conjure the old Harry Potter magic with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a prequel to the immensely popular films based on the JK Rowling books about the boy wizard. \u201cOn paper, it looks like it should be a better year for Warner Bros in 2016,\u201d said Tim Nollen, a senior analyst with Macquarie Securities who follows Time Warner. For its part, Fox will fire up the X-Men franchise again next year, with X-Men: Apocalypse, along with new installments for hit animated properties Kung Fu Panda and Ice Age. Assassins Creed, starring Michael Fassbender and coming next December, could launch another lucrative franchise. Representatives for Fox and Warner Bros said they expect to end up with about the same number of releases as this year, given the shifting of release dates or film acquisitions likely to take place during the next year. Fox has 17 on its 2016 schedule and Warner Bros has 22, according to Rentrak. But given industry trends, Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research, suggests Disney\u2019s lean-and-mean approach to releases may become more common. Discussing Time Warner in a recent research report, he expressed a lack of optimism \u201cfor more than middling expansion for the theatrical filmed entertainment space for Warner Bros (as well as for its peers), as slow box office and home entertainment growth leads to reduced investments into fewer, if slightly more profitable titles\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "You could not make it up. Our ultra-smooth prime minister has complained to the Conservative leader of Oxfordshire county council about the cuts to local authority services being made in David Cameron\u2019s constituency, which is itself in Oxfordshire. We owe this great story to the Oxford Mail, to which organ a certain exchange of letters, or possibly emails, was leaked. Welcome to the real world, Dave! When a prime minister finally wakes up to the consequences of the ideologically driven austerity policies of his own chancellor, then perhaps he should be tempted to follow the example of his hero, Harold Macmillan, and sack him. Of course he cannot. The prime minister and chancellor are, to coin a phrase, in this together. Cameron has now discovered what dawned on many of his fellow Conservative MPs some time ago in the case of the tax credits fiasco: that Osborne\u2019s austerity policies are not as popular as they assumed when they were re-elected. As Gordon Brown says: \u201cThe majority of today\u2019s poor, and the biggest losers from [Osborne\u2019s] tax credit changes, are not the unemployed or \u2018chaotic\u2019 families but hardworking parents and their children.\u201d It is good, by the way, that Brown has emerged from hiding and is speaking out. The first Big Lie perpetrated by Osborne was that the Great Recession was caused by Labour\u2019s spending rather than by the banking crisis. The second was that the budgetary problems of the UK were comparable to those of Greece. The third was that a vast proportion of the welfare budget went on the unemployed and the \u201cfeckless\u201d. As Brown points out, 1.5% of the welfare budget goes to the registered unemployed, not the 40% that the British people apparently believe, according to polls \u2013 a belief shamelessly fomented by the rightwing press. And now, hey presto, we have a fourth Big Lie: that, again according to the Gospel of Osborne, the budget deficit is a threat to national security. The truth is that the budget cuts being demanded of the armed forces and the police are themselves a serious threat to national security. The cuts being demanded of other departments, and of local authorities, such as those affecting the prime minister\u2019s constituents, may not threaten the security of the nation, but they do not do much to relieve the anxiety of people who are already experiencing financial hardship. Many people feel nervous for their own security. I fear that this egregious chancellor of the exchequer is a quintessential exponent of Orwell\u2019s dictum that \u201cpolitical language is designed to make lies sound truthful\u201d. If the underlying situation were not so serious, Osborne\u2019s policies and Big Lies would be laughable. Unfortunately they are not. Meanwhile, there is a potential economic crisis in store for the government in general and the chancellor in particular that is much more serious than the putative budgetary one. Even various erstwhile cheerleaders for Osborne, including the Financial Times, are beginning to wake up to the possibility. If it happens \u2013 and you never quite know in this mad world of financial flows \u2013 it will be a deficit crisis, but not a budget deficit crisis. It will be an old-fashioned balance of payments crisis, evoking memories of the Black Wednesday debacle in 1992. The financial markets are slowly becoming aware that the UK has been experiencing the biggest deficit on its current balance of payments in recorded history \u2013 in peacetime, that is. It had been obvious for some time that the overseas trade figures, which record the total cost of imports and the value of exports, are in marked deficit. This has reflected the cumulative impact of the damage done to manufacturing industry by the neglect of this sector during the Thatcher years, and the aggravation of this situation by sporadic periods when the pound has been too strong for the good of British industry \u2013 under governments of both major parties. Manufacturing may account for a small proportion of gross domestic product, but it still accounts for more than half of our export earnings. Until relatively recently the deleterious impact of the trade gap has been largely offset by a positive balance of investment income from our assets overseas. But it now looks as though the outflows of income from all those foreign-owned sectors of \u201cBritish\u201d industry have been eating into the traditional surplus. This is the real problem facing the British economy, and austerity policies that have contributed to the slowest recovery from recession on record have not helped when it comes to investing in the plant, machinery and service sectors that should be providing the capacity for Britain to pay its way in the world. It is truly remarkable that so much of the public debate has focused on the so-called need to cut the budget deficit faster than the balance of the economy requires. It has been a characteristic of British economic policymakers for decades that they become obsessed with the pursuit of something they think will lead them to the economic philosopher\u2019s stone. Cameron\u2019s constituents are not the only victims of this obsession, but it is good that the message has been delivered to his doorstep.",

Our ultra-smooth prime minister has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/11/david-cameron-offered-oxfordshire-council-leader-access-to-advisers\" title=\"\">complained to the Conservative leader of Oxfordshire county council</a> about the cuts to local authority services being made in David Cameron\u2019s constituency, which is itself in Oxfordshire. We owe this great story <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/13948252.David_Cameron_clashes_with_council_over_cuts_to_frontline_services/\" title=\"\">to the <em>Oxford Mail</em>,</a> to which organ a certain exchange of letters, or possibly emails, was leaked.</p> <p>Welcome to the real world, Dave! When a prime minister finally wakes up to the consequences of the ideologically driven austerity policies of his own chancellor, then perhaps he should be tempted to follow the example of his hero, Harold Macmillan, and sack him.</p> <p>Of course he cannot. The prime minister and chancellor are, to coin a phrase, in this together. Cameron has now discovered what dawned on many of his fellow Conservative MPs some time ago in the case of the tax credits fiasco: that Osborne\u2019s austerity policies are not as popular as they assumed when they were re-elected.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/10/tax-credits-osborne-poverty-working-parents-children?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">As Gordon Brown says</a>: \u201cThe majority of today\u2019s poor, and the biggest losers from [Osborne\u2019s] tax credit changes, are not the unemployed or \u2018chaotic\u2019 families but hardworking parents and their children.\u201d</p> <p>It is good, by the way, that Brown has emerged from hiding and is speaking out. The first Big Lie perpetrated by Osborne was that the Great Recession was caused by Labour\u2019s spending rather than by the banking crisis. The second was that the budgetary problems of the UK were comparable to those of Greece. The third was that a vast proportion of the welfare budget went on the unemployed and the \u201cfeckless\u201d. As Brown points out, 1.5% of the welfare budget goes to the registered unemployed, not the 40% that the British people apparently believe, according to polls \u2013 a belief shamelessly fomented by the rightwing&#xa0;press.</p> <p>And now, hey presto, we have a fourth Big Lie: that, again according to the Gospel of Osborne, the budget deficit is a threat to national security.</p> <p>The truth is that the budget cuts being demanded of the armed forces and the police are themselves a serious threat to national security. The cuts being demanded of other departments, and of local authorities, such as those affecting the prime minister\u2019s constituents, may not threaten the security of the nation, but they do not do much to relieve the anxiety of people who are already experiencing financial hardship. Many people feel nervous for their own security.</p> <p>I fear that this egregious chancellor of the exchequer is a quintessential exponent of Orwell\u2019s dictum that \u201cpolitical language is designed to make lies sound truthful\u201d.</p> <p>If the underlying situation were not so serious, Osborne\u2019s policies and Big Lies would be laughable. Unfortunately they are not.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there is a potential economic crisis in store for the government in general and the chancellor in particular that is much more serious than the putative budgetary one. Even various erstwhile cheerleaders for Osborne, including the <em>Financial Times</em>, are beginning to wake up to the possibility. If it happens \u2013 and you never quite know in this mad world of financial flows \u2013 it will be a deficit crisis, but not a budget deficit crisis. It will be an old-fashioned balance of payments crisis, evoking memories of the Black Wednesday debacle in 1992.</p> <p>The financial markets are slowly becoming aware that the UK has been experiencing the biggest deficit on its current balance of payments in recorded history \u2013 in peacetime, that is. It had been obvious for some time that the overseas trade figures, which record the total cost of imports and the value of exports, are in marked deficit. This has reflected the cumulative impact of the damage done to manufacturing industry by the neglect of this sector during the Thatcher years, and the aggravation of this situation by sporadic periods when the pound has been too strong for the good of British industry \u2013 under governments of both major parties.</p> <p>Manufacturing may account for a small proportion of gross domestic product, but it still accounts for more than half of our export earnings.</p> <p>Until relatively recently the deleterious impact of the trade gap has been largely offset by a positive balance of investment income from our assets overseas. But it now looks as though the outflows of income from all those foreign-owned sectors of \u201cBritish\u201d industry have been eating into the traditional surplus.</p> <p>This is the real problem facing the British economy, and austerity policies that have contributed to the slowest recovery from recession on record have not helped when it comes to investing in the plant, machinery and service sectors that should be providing the capacity for Britain to pay its way in the world.</p> <p>It is truly remarkable that so much of the public debate has focused on the so-called need to cut the budget deficit faster than the balance of the economy requires. It has been a characteristic of British economic policymakers for decades that they become obsessed with the pursuit of something they think will lead them to the economic philosopher\u2019s stone. Cameron\u2019s constituents are not the only victims of this obsession, but it is good that the message has been delivered to his doorstep.</p>",

Many of the postal workers who received free shares in the October 2013 flotation may well wish they could follow suit, but sadly for them they are locked in for another year or so. Still, given that employees paid nothing in the first place, they will still make some kind of profit even if the shares fall from their current level of 444p. And they could well do that, because the company faces a number of challenges in the months ahead. Competition continues to eat away at its business, with the likes of Amazon muscling in on the delivery market with its own network. Royal Mail continues to cut costs to cope, but there is always the prospect of industrial action in the background. With the all-important Christmas trading period ahead, this week\u2019s half-year results are expected to show a 7% fall in operating profits to \u00a3322m, according to analysts at Jefferies. They said: \u201cWe don\u2019t expect the company to paint a bullish outlook pending a new labour agreement, and the parcel market is increasingly competitive.\u201d Investec is more optimistic, pointing to the prospect of changes to Royal Mail\u2019s pension scheme, its lack of debt and an estimated \u00a3600m of surplus property to be sold. Interesting birthday for easyJet It has been a striking few days for easyJet. The budget airline last week celebrated its 20th anniversary and has now launched a loyalty scheme for frequent flyers. But of course the dominant event in the aviation world recently has been the fallout from the Metrojet crash in Egypt, which left thousands of passengers \u2013 including those of easyJet \u2013 stranded in Sharm el-Sheikh. The subsequent confusion over rescue flights did the airline no favours, and the effect on future bookings is yet to be determined. Analysts will be looking for clarification on this issue when it reports full-year results on Tuesday. In September easyJet forecast annual profits of \u00a3675m-\u00a3700m (an increase on the previous forecast of \u00a3620m-\u00a3660m). Those figures will not be affected by the Egyptian crash, which took place after the year end, but the airline\u2019s first-quarter performance is likely to be a different matter. The City will also be watching for any comments on the low oil price, and whether this will feed through into lower ticket prices, as competition in the budget airline sector continues to grow. Signs of interest in the US? Those who like to read the runes of central bank speak will be looking forward to Wednesday, when the US Federal Reserve releases the minutes of its October meeting. Although the Fed left interest rates on hold last month, it omitted a key phrase about \u201cglobal risks\u201d which had been included in the September statement, and that encouraged the belief that it was keen to sanction dearer borrowing costs at its December meeting (the next one on the calendar, since the Fed skips November). A stronger-than-expected US jobs figure since the October meeting has only strengthened this view, despite the announcement of some weak retail sales figures on Friday. But the minutes will be scrutinised for any indication of how many of the Fed\u2019s rate setters are likely to back an increase, since there still seems to be a divide in opinion between the various members. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, said: \u201cThe doves, led by Lael Brainard and Charles Evans, appear to be in the minority. These minutes will be very useful for judging just how persuasive Brainard\u2019s arguments have been.

      "bodyText": "We all have our own techniques for extracting that last dollop of tomato ketchup or mayonnaise from the bottle. Some prefer the knife in the jar trick; others simply bang and squeeze. Some inventive souls have even been known to use a dash of vinegar to swirl out the very last drop. It\u2019s not just sauces - extracting toothpaste and beauty products from plastic containers can be a tricky process too as the contents stick stubbornly to the sides of the tube. For mayonnaise lovers at least, help is at hand. In the next few months a Norwegian company is launching a product that won\u2019t stick to the sides of the bottle but instead slips easily onto the plate. It\u2019s not the mayonnaise that\u2019s new, nor the packaging. The innovation is a coating developed in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that sits between the product and the packaging and which works to create a slippery surface that enables the sauce to slide from the bottle. Mayonnaise from the Norwegian foods company Orkla will be the first consumer product to employ technology from LiquiGlide, the Massachusetts-based firm established to develop the coating technology. \u201cThe product, whatever it may be, lotion or mayonnaise, is sliding on our liquid layer. So it is a liquid to liquid interface, which is what makes it slippery,\u201d Leslie Rose of LiquiGlide said. She compares the effect to oil on a frying pan. The coating technology was developed when LiquiGlide\u2019s now chief executive, Dave Smith, was studying under Professor Kripa Varanasi at MIT. They were working on the prevention of clogging in oil and gas pipelines and how to stop ice forming on airplane wings. They came up with a system of \u201cliquid-impregnated surfaces\u201d where coatings cling to surfaces - such as glass or plastic - and allow the liquid to slide out seamlessly. The coatings are each made up of different materials which work with the liquid in the container - such as a mayonnaise - to allow it to slide out. In the case of some foods, a substance similar to a vegetable oil is used. A database of hundreds of combinations of materials has been devised by the company so that the make-up of the coatings work with the corresponding liquids. When used in food packaging, the coatings are made up of foods while for shampoos and lotions, they are made up of health and beauty product ingredients, said Smith. The exact formulations of the coatings has not been revealed. \u201cWe will want to be as clear as possible that these coatings are made from food [in the case of foods] and make sure someone is well informed of that so won\u2019t get nervous. I think this will soon become a common thing in packaging,\u201d he said. Varanasi said that the development was \u201cparadigm shifting\u201d in terms of the range of applications which could be used for the coatings. The mayonnaise container from Orkla will be the first consumer application while the first industrial application is expected next year. The technology has been licensed to Elmer\u2019s, a US glue company, and Pact, an Australian packaging firm. The coatings are not toxic, according to the company, and could be scraped off and eaten in the case of those on the side of ketchup bottles. LiquiGlide does not manufacture the coatings but develops the formulations for companies to spray them on the inside of packaging. What knock-on effect this will have to the consumer will be down to the company which licences the technology, said Rose. The company is quick to play up the implications on waste and the savings that will be made as a result of the entirety of liquids being used. Smith said that between 5% and 20% of foods can typically be left behind in packaging at present. \u201cWe want regular packaging to soon look old-fashioned. If there [are] any initial barriers [in people\u2019s understanding of the coatings], we will get over that pretty quickly and I think people are going to come to expect this in their packaging,\u201d he said. So far, 30 different companies are working on plans for their technology, with a diverse range of potential uses from nail polish and water desalination to clog prevention in medical stents, countering moulds in manufacturing machinery and preventing the corrosive build-up of oil in pipelines. The coatings work on smooth surfaces such as glass, plastic, ceramics and metals. The technology does not work with solids, however. Rose said there had been queries about using the materials on boats, cars and toilets but because the coatings are wet to the touch, in the case of vehicles, dust and dirt would stick to a car windshield. The lifespan of the coating is designed to be the same as that of the particular product it shares a container with, said Rose. And to companies concerned that less waste will mean fewer products are bought, LiquiGlide said the turnaround time for using goods will be quicker - and should thus increase sales. Slippery business How does it work? Each of the coatings are developed to correspond to the product in the container. The coating is a a \u201cliquid impregnated surface\u201d which results in a permanently wet feel that allows liquids such as ketchup to slip out. This is achieved by layers on top of the container. First is a solid which clings to the structure of the container, such as glass. That solid traps a liquid lubricant - the next layer - and creates a permanently slippery, liquid surface. As a result, the liquid in the bottle or container is sliding on another liquid. In the case of mayonnaise, the corresponding liquid is similar to a vegetable oil. \u201cWe create this textured solid on the package \u2013 like a mini mountain range or a sponge \u2013 then we apply a liquid which is attracted to that textured solid and it fills in the valleys and covers the peaks of that mountain range and it is held there through capillary forces,\u201d Rose said. \u2022You can read our archive of The Innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

They were working on the prevention of clogging in oil and gas pipelines and how to stop ice forming on airplane wings. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6e3451e7591b93aaab893b2a17751dc1467368e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e3451e7591b93aaab893b2a17751dc1467368e3/0_39_631_379/500.jpg\" alt=\"Dave Smith\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LiquiGlide co-founder CEO Dave Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They came up with a system of \u201cliquid-impregnated surfaces\u201d where coatings cling to surfaces - such as glass or plastic - and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPJa_eZBPGI\">allow the liquid to slide out seamlessly.</a></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://liquiglide.com/tech/\">coatings</a> are each made up of different materials which work with the liquid in the container - such as a mayonnaise - to allow it to slide out. In the case of some foods, a substance similar to a vegetable oil is used. A database of hundreds of combinations of materials has been devised by the company so that the make-up of the coatings work with the corresponding liquids. <br></p> <p>When used in food packaging, the coatings are made up of foods while for shampoos and lotions, they are made up of health and beauty product ingredients, said Smith. The exact formulations of the coatings has not been revealed.</p> <p>\u201cWe will want to be as clear as possible that these coatings are made from food [in the case of foods] and make sure someone is well informed of that so won\u2019t get nervous. I think this will soon become a common thing in packaging,\u201d he said.</p> <p></p> <p>Varanasi said that the development was \u201cparadigm shifting\u201d in terms of the range of applications which could be used for the coatings. The mayonnaise container from Orkla will be the first consumer application while the first industrial application is expected next year. The technology has been licensed to Elmer\u2019s, a US glue company, and Pact, an Australian packaging firm.</p> <p>The coatings are not toxic, according to the company, and could be scraped off and eaten in the case of those on the side of ketchup bottles. LiquiGlide does not manufacture the coatings but develops the formulations for companies to spray them on the inside of packaging. What knock-on effect this will have to the consumer will be down to the company which licences the technology, said Rose. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eb404b2a22174e9c67099a85b6bebd50f2c3c83d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb404b2a22174e9c67099a85b6bebd50f2c3c83d/0_603_2832_1699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LiquiGlide\u2019s co-founder Professor Kripa Varanasi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LiquiGlide co-founder Professor Kripa Varanasi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The company is quick to play up the implications on waste and the savings that will be made as a result of the entirety of liquids being used. Smith said that between 5% and 20% of foods can typically be left behind in packaging at present. \u201cWe want regular packaging to soon look old-fashioned. If there [are] any initial barriers [in people\u2019s understanding of the coatings], we will get over that pretty quickly and I think people are going to come to expect this in their packaging,\u201d he said.</p> <p>So far, 30 different companies are working on plans for their technology, with a diverse range of potential uses from nail polish and water desalination to clog prevention in medical stents, countering moulds in manufacturing machinery and preventing the corrosive build-up of oil in pipelines. The coatings work on smooth surfaces such as glass, plastic, ceramics and metals.</p> <p>The technology does not work with solids, however. Rose said there had been queries about using the materials on boats, cars and toilets but because the coatings are wet to the touch, in the case of vehicles, dust and dirt would stick to a car windshield. </p> <p>The lifespan of the coating is designed to be the same as that of the particular product it shares a container with, said Rose. And to companies concerned that less waste will mean fewer products are bought, LiquiGlide said the turnaround time for using goods will be quicker - and should thus increase sales.<br></p> <h2><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5161cd828586e53f39ca9897e4b51309bea84ae8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5161cd828586e53f39ca9897e4b51309bea84ae8/0_0_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LiquiGlide test\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LiquiGlide can work with various products, from glue to face creams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liquiglide</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Slippery business</h2> <p>How does it work? Each of the coatings are developed to correspond to the product in the container. The coating is a a \u201cliquid impregnated surface\u201d which results in a permanently wet feel that allows liquids such as ketchup to slip out. This is achieved by layers on top of the container. First is a solid which clings to the structure of the container, such as glass. That solid traps a liquid lubricant - the next layer - and creates a permanently slippery, liquid surface. As a result, the liquid in the bottle or container is sliding on another liquid. In the case of mayonnaise, the corresponding liquid is similar to a vegetable oil. </p> <p>\u201cWe create this textured solid on the package \u2013 like a mini mountain range or a sponge \u2013 then we apply a liquid which is attracted to that textured solid and it fills in the valleys and covers the peaks of that mountain range and it is held there through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_action\">capillary forces</a>,\u201d Rose said.</p> <p><em>\u2022You can read our archive of The Innovators columns <a href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/the-innovators-column\">on the Big Innovation Centre website</a> where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "How ironic that just as Indian prime minister Narendra Modi was in Britain last week talking up the trading links between the two countries, defence group BAE Systems was announcing 371 UK job losses that are due in no small part to decisions made by India in 2012. If India had agreed back then to buy 126 BAE-made Eurofighter Typhoon jets, British manufacturing might not be under the pressure that it feels today. That deal would have been worth around \u00a37bn, with the order securing the jobs of thousands of workers at BAE plants across the UK. Instead, India chose to order the same number of Rafale aircraft from French manufacturer Dassault. With limited overseas demand for the Typhoon, BAE has had to slow down production of the fighter jet and cut jobs. When production began in the 1990s, it was hoped that overseas orders would pour in to underpin the project. But, a controversial order from Saudi Arabia apart, tie-ups with India, the UAE and other countries have failed to materialise. And BAE is not the only aerospace manufacturer in Britain feeling the pinch. Engine maker Rolls-Royce issued a profits warning last Thursday that wiped a fifth off the value of its shares. The problems facing Britain\u2019s aerospace industry can be summed up in two aircraft: the Typhoon and the Airbus A380 superjumbo. Rolls-Royce makes engines for both aircraft. The company placed a bet on large, wide-bodied aircraft such as the A380 and on the next generation of narrow-bodied, or short-haul, planes that will come after the Airbus A320neo and the Boeing 737 Max. That bet went wrong, however, as long-haul airlines focused instead on smaller, single-aisle planes that are becoming increasingly cheap to run. Airlines have decided they don\u2019t need large planes to cross the world and, as a result, orders for the A380 have been disappointing. This is having a twofold effect on Rolls-Royce: not only is demand for engines for larger planes down, but airlines\u2019 existing smaller planes are proving so viable that the company may also have to wait longer than hoped for orders for the new generation of narrow-bodies. The group is also being dragged down by a slowdown in Rolls-Royce\u2019s other businesses \u2013 including defence, nuclear and marine. Warren East, the new Rolls-Royce chief executive, is reviewing the company\u2019s strategy and has plans to cut costs by up to \u00a3200m each year. But this will not fix the strategic error made by his predecessors, Sir John Rose and John Rishton, which has seen Rolls-Royce miss out on the boom in the narrow-bodied civil aerospace market. Rolls-Royce is in for a rough few years. For George Osborne, the march of the makers has become the malaise of the manufacturers. Rolls-Royce and BAE are two of the country\u2019s biggest and best-known companies in this sector. It is difficult to get manufacturing in the UK firing on all cylinders and contributing to economic growth when FTSE 100 giants like these are struggling, and with them the hundreds of small businesses that supply them with parts. To make matters worse, Jaguar Land Rover, the greatest success story of British manufacturing since the financial crisis, is also pausing for breath. The carmaker is reviewing its operation and could cut \u00a34.5bn of costs. To be fair to the manufacturers, they are battling against a collection of adverse global factors. A slowdown in Chinese economic growth and the fall in the price of oil has hit demand in their key markets. BAE, Rolls-Royce and JLR will fight back. Although the performance of manufacturers can fluctuate with the global economy, they are anchored around long-term investors. These three companies have invested billions in technology and remain at the forefront of their markets, with extraordinary talented people in their ranks. In 10 years\u2019 time, Rolls-Royce could be enjoying extraordinary demand for engines for next-generation planes, and we could all be praising the decision to focus on developing new technology rather than supplying old. But with BAE also grounded, British manufacturing could struggle to take wing until then. The Bank has not thrown its doors open wide enough More of Britain\u2019s institutions should throw open their doors to the public. It is good to see how the suits that make so many important decisions conduct themselves and to get them to answer a few questions. When the Bank of England welcomed 200 members of the public last week to the Guildhall in London and a similar event in Edinburgh, it provided an insight into the way central bank officials think and some of their priorities. In an era when democratic institutions increasingly defer to unelected officials, any chance to get close to where the power lies must be important. Yet this was not an exercise that could be compared to a company\u2019s annual general meeting. The open forum exercise orchestrated by Bank governor Mark Carney was a distinctly controlled affair, which meant the day avoided comparison to an annual meeting\u2019s long lines of shareholders addressing their concerns to the chairman of the board, who must, through time-honoured tradition, offer long and often detailed answers. There were a few questions from the floor, but not many. And too often speakers fell back on indecipherable jargon to get their point across \u2013 step forward, European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi. It would be better if Carney had chosen a simpler exercise, much as the Bank\u2019s sister regulator has done for many years. The Financial Conduct Authority holds an annual general meeting that must be gruelling for its board members, offering as it does the opportunity for experts and the public alike to grill them mercilessly. An open forum is one thing. But providing a well-informed and feisty public with the chance to grill Bank insiders would be a better way to enhance democracy. Monetary policy affects everyone and the Bank\u2019s persistent failure to judge the course of the recovery must be worth a few questions from inquisitive outsiders. \u2018The Lidl with a lav\u2019 could flush away a big advantage Not content with proffering cheap champagne and Iberico ham, Lidl is aiming to pamper its new middle-class fans with new luxuries such as customer toilets and self-service checkouts. Its new \u00a32m Rushden store, the \u201cLidl with a lav\u201d, is bigger and glossier than its usual outlets and marks a change in the way the German discounter wants to be perceived in Britain. If the economy improves it could be a smart move by Lidl, ensuring it doesn\u2019t get left behind as people have more money to spend and become less interested in shopping around. The risk is that all the bells and whistles of a traditional supermarket will need to be paid for by price increases. Then shoppers will be left with a not-so-cheap, limited range of groceries and still have to visit other stores to get all they need. Lidl will have to be careful, or it could see its point of difference flushed away.",
