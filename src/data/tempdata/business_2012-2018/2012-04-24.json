      "bodyText": "Europe's financial markets have recovered their poise after Monday's panic sell-off, despite clashes in the Dutch parliament over the country's austerity measures. Share prices plunged at the start of the week, after Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's strong showing in Sunday's first round of the French presidential election. Nervous investors fear that support for Hollande, and the surprise collapse of the Dutch government, reveal a growing Europe-wide backlash against the austerity policies Brussels believes are the only way of safeguarding the single currency. However, the Netherlands managed a successful debt auction on Tuesday, selling \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.6bn) of bonds in two minutes, suggesting financial markets have not lost confidence in the country's ability to fix its finances. Analyst Lyn Graham-Taylor of Rabobank said the results were \"by no means a disaster given we've seen the biggest upheaval ahead of a Dutch bond sale for many years\". The smooth running of the debt sale helped to restore a mood of calm to financial markets and, in London the FTSE 100 closed up 43 points, or 0.78%, at 5709, while the French market bounced by more than 2%, and the German DAX by more than 1%. The Dutch political crisis deepened, however, as opposition politicians said they could not back the prime minister's budget plans, raising doubts over whether the country can meet the 3%-of-GDP deficit target imposed by Brussels. Without new spending cuts the deficit is expected to be 4.6% of GDP. Mark Rutte, who offered his resignation as prime minister on Monday, appealed for cross-party support to impose an austerity package worth between \u20ac14bn and \u20ac16bn, but Socialist leader Emile Roemer said: \"I understand that you have to bring finances in order but you cannot cut rigorously because it hurts the economy and people.

Fresh evidence of the impact of the latest austerity measures on Greece's recession-ravaged government came from Bank of Greece governor Giorgos Provopoulos, who predicted that the economy would shrink by 5% this year, with wages set to decline by another 10%. The hefty price of the deficit-cutting measures Greece signed up to as part of its latest bailout deal is helping to boost support for fringe political parties in the runup to elections next month, which could make it hard to form a stable government. Unemployment in Greece is already above 20%. With Hollande pledging that he will seek to renegotiate the tough \"fiscal compact\" which allows Brussels to impose strict spending limits on eurozone member countries, there are growing fears in financial markets that the carefully negotiated Europe-wide deal that came with the rescue package for Greece could be about to collapse.",

      "bodyText": "The struggling flooring specialist Carpetright has fired off its seventh profit warning in just over a year as rising living costs and a stagnant housing market stifles the high street. Carpetright, which is run by its founder, Lord Harris, said annual profits would collapse to \u00a33m-\u00a34m, sharply down from the \u00a312m to \u00a317m forecast in October, after an ill-starred move into bed sales. The specialist chain, which relies on people moving house to stimulate sales, made profits of \u00a328m last year. Carpetright's travails came as a key consumer spending barometer showed the spending power of the average UK household had fallen back to the levels of November 2008, when the country was mired in recession. Families had \u00a310 a week less to spend in March than a year ago, according to the Asda Income Tracker. The survey said households had disposable income of \u00a3144 in March, 6.5% lower than in 2011, as they struggled with higher utility bills and transport costs. The cost of electricity and gas remained well above last year, up more than 8% and 16% respectively in March, with petrol and diesel prices also more than 4% higher. \"Family budgets in 2012 are continuing to be squeezed by the three pressures of high unemployment, very weak wage increases and stubbornly elevated inflation,\" said Charles Davis, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. \"While growth in the price of essentials is likely to fall back slowly this year, the tough conditions in the UK labour market look set to prevail.\" The income tracker also showed some parts of the country continuing to be harder hit by the downturn than others, with households in Northern Ireland and the north-west of England much worse off than those in the south-east. Irish families had \u00a383 for extras compared with the UK average of \u00a3144, in the first quarter. In London, spending power was higher, at \u00a3184 a week for the three-month period. Last week official figures showed the first rise in inflation for five months, partly due to higher food and clothing costs. The consumer price index rose to 3.5% in March, up from 3.4% in February, according to the Office for National Statistics, well above the average 1.1% pay rises being pushed through by companies. The plight faced by Britons was also highlighted by latest figures from Kantar Worldpanel which showed the grocery market growing at 5% in the 12 weeks to 15 April, the biggest increase in more than two years due to higher food prices. The squeeze is encouraging shoppers to go to \"no frills\" chains such as Lidl and Iceland, which posted sales uplifts that were streets ahead of that of the big four supermarkets. Aldi chalked up growth of 27.9% in the 12 weeks to 15 April, compared with the market leader Tesco, which managed 4.2%. Edward Garner, an analyst at Kantar, said shoppers were seeking out \"strong value-for-money messages\"; Waitrose was also beating the market as shoppers bought more expensive groceries rather than splash out on a restaurant meal. \"The discounters and Waitrose are outperforming the middle ground as shoppers polarise their spend,\" Garner said. With many families struggling to cover the basics, household goods retailers like Carpetright, which has 475 stores in the UK, are finding it hard to drum up custom as big purchases such as a new carpet or bed are postponed. Although UK like-for-like sales did pick up to 1.4% in the 11 weeks to 14 April, its profits were hit after bed sales fell short of expectations. \"The fragile confidence of our customers continues to produce a weak and volatile floor coverings market,\" said Harris, its chairman and chief executive.

Carnwath has held the post for less than a year, so it seems unlikely she would be keen to quit even if the vote against her re-election as a director approaches the rumoured 15%. But Barclays, after the chaotic and bitter build-up to this year's annual meeting, needs to make a fresh start on pay \u2013 and that would be best achieved if Carnwath stood down from the pay committee. Barclays, remember, is an organisation that says it fully understands that pay arrangements in banking must change. \"Compensation has to adjust to the new reality of lower returns for the sector,\" says chairman Marcus Agius. Part of the debate, then, is whether Barclays is adjusting fast enough in directing a greater share of the spoils towards shareholders and away from employees \u2013 and it's a large part of the job of Carnwath's committee to ensure that it does. Last week's concessions (chief executive Bob Diamond and finance director Chris Lucas volunteered to make half their 2011 bonuses subject to the eventual achievement of an acceptable return on capital) were, in effect, an admission that Barclays got it wrong. If the remuneration committee had done its job properly, a panicky 11th-hour attempt to contain the level of shareholder revolt would not have been necessary. If Carnwath had been on the ball and had lived up to her reputation as a tough boardroom cookie, she could have insisted on such conditionality in the first place. Instead her committee agreed simply staggering payouts to Diamond &amp; co in a lousy year for the bank. The chief executive was awarded an annual bonus worth 200% of salary in a year in which return on equity fell from 7.2% to 5.8%. The financial performance was so far away from the ambition of 13% that Diamond himself labelled it \"unacceptable\". That judgment was reinforced by a graph that leaps from the pages of the remuneration report: \u00a3100 invested in the FTSE 100 index in December 2006 was worth \u00a3108 at the end of last year; \u00a3100 invested in Barclays shares became \u00a329. Yet the pay committee seemed incapable of grasping the basic point that handing a total of \u00a317m to Diamond (that's ignoring the \u00a35.7m \"tax equalisation\" handout) in this circumstance would be also be unacceptable to a large constituency of shareholders. The only alternative explanation is that Carnwath lacked the bottle to deliver some hard truths to the executives. Either way, appointing a new chair of the remuneration committee would be quickest way to try to repair the damage to the bank's relations with its owners. Barclays is not alone in the banking world in dragging its feet on pay reforms. Citigroup's Vikram Pandit discovered that most shareholders disapproved of his pay last year; other US banks may also receive similar messages. But the fact that the banking industry as a whole finally seems to be exhausting the patience of shareholders is not a reason for Carnwath to cling on.",

      "body": "<p>Leading shares recovered some of their losses after Monday's sell off, despite lingering eurozone worries and a mixed bag of US economic data, which prompted talk of further Federal Reserve measures to boost the world's largest economy.</p> <p><strong>Man</strong> was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, as bid hopes returned after the hedge fund group's recent poor performance. It has been under pressure on worries about slowing growth and weak results from its key AHL fund. But its shares added 4.45p to 97p after UBS analysts said it could be a prime target for a north American asset manager, with a bid of 150p a share possibly being enough to win the day. Analyst Arnaud Giblat said a break up value on the business would be 100p, with any bidder having to pay a premium:</p> <blockquote> We estimate that Man is currently trading 5% below the combined value of AHL being run off (38p a share), GLG (33p a share), the institutional business (9p a share) and its net cash position (20p a share). With Man shares having traded below 150p for a six-month period, we believe that a 50% plus premium bid offer to the current share price would be sufficient to obtain shareholder approval. <br> We would not be surprised to see a bid from a north American asset manager that is trading on high earnings multiples, has surplus capital and has stated its intent to diversify geographies and product exposures. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Singer Capital Markets also repeated its buy rating on the business, albeit cutting its price target from 190p to 170p.</p> <p><strong>National Grid</strong> was also in demand. Its shares ended up 14.5p at 667.5p after Morgan Stanley moved its recommendation from equal weight to overweight ahead of regulator Ofgem publishing its initial review of the company's business plans in June. The bank said it believed the review would be much better for the company than originally feared, and that it was unlikely to need another cash call as had been suggested:</p> <blockquote> Concerns on new UK regulation are overdone, in our view; Grid will deliver decent growth and not require any equity issuance. The UK regulatory asset base will grow at 10% per annum, we estimate, justifying a higher valuation than other regulated utilities, and [its US business] should deliver improved returns and rate base growth. We think Grid could cut costs further. The culmination of the UK regulatory reviews and recent board changes could be the necessary catalysts. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile UBS added the company to its top 40 global stock list due to its dividend yield, which it forecast would reach 6.2% this year.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 43.92 points higher at 5709.49 after its 106 point decline on Monday. There was still uncertainty over the situation in Holland, as its government resigned amid disagreements over its austerity budget.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares recovered some of their losses after Monday's sell off, despite lingering eurozone worries and a mixed bag of US economic data, which prompted talk of further Federal Reserve measures to boost the world's largest economy. Man was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, as bid hopes returned after the hedge fund group's recent poor performance. It has been under pressure on worries about slowing growth and weak results from its key AHL fund. But its shares added 4.45p to 97p after UBS analysts said it could be a prime target for a north American asset manager, with a bid of 150p a share possibly being enough to win the day. Analyst Arnaud Giblat said a break up value on the business would be 100p, with any bidder having to pay a premium: We estimate that Man is currently trading 5% below the combined value of AHL being run off (38p a share), GLG (33p a share), the institutional business (9p a share) and its net cash position (20p a share). With Man shares having traded below 150p for a six-month period, we believe that a 50% plus premium bid offer to the current share price would be sufficient to obtain shareholder approval. We would not be surprised to see a bid from a north American asset manager that is trading on high earnings multiples, has surplus capital and has stated its intent to diversify geographies and product exposures. Meanwhile Singer Capital Markets also repeated its buy rating on the business, albeit cutting its price target from 190p to 170p. National Grid was also in demand. Its shares ended up 14.5p at 667.5p after Morgan Stanley moved its recommendation from equal weight to overweight ahead of regulator Ofgem publishing its initial review of the company's business plans in June. The bank said it believed the review would be much better for the company than originally feared, and that it was unlikely to need another cash call as had been suggested: Concerns on new UK regulation are overdone, in our view; Grid will deliver decent growth and not require any equity issuance. The UK regulatory asset base will grow at 10% per annum, we estimate, justifying a higher valuation than other regulated utilities, and [its US business] should deliver improved returns and rate base growth. We think Grid could cut costs further. The culmination of the UK regulatory reviews and recent board changes could be the necessary catalysts. Meanwhile UBS added the company to its top 40 global stock list due to its dividend yield, which it forecast would reach 6.2% this year. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 43.92 points higher at 5709.49 after its 106 point decline on Monday. There was still uncertainty over the situation in Holland, as its government resigned amid disagreements over its austerity budget.

Haldane used three examples to demonstrate this point.</p> <p>First, he noted that performance measures in banking, such as returns on equity and executive compensation, rose dramatically in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. As banks tried to keep up with their competitors by growing their balance sheets, returns on equity and executive pay spiralled. Generally, the bigger a firm's market value, the bigger the bonus.</p> <p>\"That Himalayan rise in bank executive salaries made the financial sector salary boom of even the 1920s look like a foothill,\" said Haldane. This resulted in a \"high-leverage equilibrium\" that \"sowed the seeds of the financial crisis\".</p> <p>Secondly, the technological revolution in financial markets created a quest for speed in trading activities, dubbed a \"race to zero\". Haldane argued that the emergence of high-frequency trading, which has some clear benefits, also created uncertainties. Thirdly, investors' pre-crisis quest for return has been replaced by a quest for safety. As a result, a large and rising number of global banks' refinancing has taken place on secured terms. But Haldane argued that the quest for individual safety may generate system-wide instability: \"At high levels of encumbrance, the financial system as a whole may even be riskier, as it is more susceptible to pro-cyclical swings in the underlying value of banks' assets.\"</p> <p>Haldane suggests that these arms races \u2013 in return, speed, and safety \u2013 could have been prevented. But to be effective, policy intervention would have needed to constrain behaviour across the financial system as a whole. In other words, \"policy needs to have a macro-prudential, as distinct from micro-prudential, perspective\".</p> <p>Haldane then turned to the tools that agencies such as the FPC might need to tackle financial arms races. Constraints on banks' leverage could have \"defused the return on equity race at source\". Restrictions on cash distributions by banks, a favoured recommendation of the FPC over the past six months, can also help. Haldane welcomed measures such as maximum order cancellation ratios and strengthening circuit-breakers to curb speed races in financial markets. Finally, the FPC has paid increasing attention to the systemic risk posed by rising levels of bank encumbrance (the fraction of banks' liabilities that are secured against their assets). Haldane suggests that greater transparency and maximum limits on asset encumbrance could be considered.</p>",

Generally, the bigger a firm's market value, the bigger the bonus. \"That Himalayan rise in bank executive salaries made the financial sector salary boom of even the 1920s look like a foothill,\" said Haldane. This resulted in a \"high-leverage equilibrium\" that \"sowed the seeds of the financial crisis\". Secondly, the technological revolution in financial markets created a quest for speed in trading activities, dubbed a \"race to zero\". Haldane argued that the emergence of high-frequency trading, which has some clear benefits, also created uncertainties. Thirdly, investors' pre-crisis quest for return has been replaced by a quest for safety. As a result, a large and rising number of global banks' refinancing has taken place on secured terms. But Haldane argued that the quest for individual safety may generate system-wide instability: \"At high levels of encumbrance, the financial system as a whole may even be riskier, as it is more susceptible to pro-cyclical swings in the underlying value of banks' assets.\" Haldane suggests that these arms races \u2013 in return, speed, and safety \u2013 could have been prevented. But to be effective, policy intervention would have needed to constrain behaviour across the financial system as a whole. In other words, \"policy needs to have a macro-prudential, as distinct from micro-prudential, perspective\". Haldane then turned to the tools that agencies such as the FPC might need to tackle financial arms races. Constraints on banks' leverage could have \"defused the return on equity race at source\". Restrictions on cash distributions by banks, a favoured recommendation of the FPC over the past six months, can also help. Haldane welcomed measures such as maximum order cancellation ratios and strengthening circuit-breakers to curb speed races in financial markets. Finally, the FPC has paid increasing attention to the systemic risk posed by rising levels of bank encumbrance (the fraction of banks' liabilities that are secured against their assets). Haldane suggests that greater transparency and maximum limits on asset encumbrance could be considered.",

      "bodyText": "The British government borrowed more than expected last month, but still managed to meet its target for the financial year. City economists said the high March shortfall highlighted the pressure on the chancellor to stick to his austerity measures, especially as the credit rating agencies Moody's and Fitch have put the UK's AAA-rating on negative outlook. But Labour warned that George Osborne risked choking off the recovery, with falling tax receipts last month underlining the fragile state of the economy. Public sector net borrowing, excluding the effect of the banking bailouts \u2013 the government's preferred measure \u2013 rose to \u00a318.2bn last month, from \u00a318bn a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics. This was worse than the \u00a316bn predicted by City economists. Tax receipts fell and government departments went on an unusually large spending splurge ahead of the end of the fiscal year. However, downward revisions to previous months (the February shortfall was trimmed to \u00a312.2bn from the previously reported \u00a315.2bn) meant Osborne met his full-year target. The government borrowed \u00a3126bn over the 2011/12 financial year, bang in line with the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast in the March budget, and far below the \u00a3136.8bn deficit run up last year. \"These figures show that last year George Osborne borrowed \u00a39bn more than he planned to at the time of his spending review,\" said Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. \"There do need to be tough decisions on tax, spending and pay. But by choking off the recovery, pushing up unemployment and so borrowing billions more to pay for economic failure, cutting spending and raising taxes too far and too fast has backfired. And this government's pledge to balance the books by 2015 is now in tatters.\" As a percentage of GDP, borrowing fell to 8.3% in 2011/12 from 9.3% in 2010/11, also in line with government forecasts. The chancellor has vowed to largely eliminate Britain's budget deficit in coming years. It was at a record 11% when the coalition government took power in 2010. Britain's net debt climbed to \u00a31.02tn in March, equivalent to 66% of GDP, the highest since records began in 1993. When the government set out its deficit reduction plans in 2010, it pencilled in tax increases worth \u00a329bn and spending cuts worth \u00a383bn over the next five years. However, Blerina Uci at Barclays Capital said the five-year plan had turned into a seven-year plan: \"The OBR has lowered its GDP growth forecast for 2011-12 to 0.5% from 2.4% and its 2012-13 forecast to 1% from 2.9%. This has led the government to slow the pace of fiscal consolidation in the medium term. The government has eased both the pace of spending cuts and the pace of tax increases \u2013 the net effect has, however, been for fiscal consolidation to last for longer and to be even more severe in the long run (cumulative spending cuts have increased to \u00a3126bn).\" Tax receipts were disappointing in March, which suggests that weaker economic activity took its toll. Income and capital gains tax receipts were down by 3.6% year-on-year, while the VAT take fell 1%. \"With the economic recovery continuing to stutter, we think it will become increasingly difficult for the government to meet its ambitious deficit reduction plans in the coming fiscal year,\" said Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics.",

Find out what City economists and Labour made of the numbers.</p> <h2>Nida Ali, economic advisor to the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club<br></h2> <p>A lacklustre end to the financial year, with March seeing a slight increase in public borrowing, compared to a year earlier. However, thanks to strong figures in the first 10 months of the financial year, this didn't prevent the chancellor from meeting the OBR's forecast of lowering borrowing to \u00a3126bn in 2011/12.</p> <p>It is discouraging that the rate of increase in central government spending outpaced the rise in tax revenues. A closer look at the release reveals some unpalatable trends. For instance, VAT receipts that until the end of last year, had been boosted by the increased VAT rate, fell in March reflecting weak consumer spending.</p> <p>The outlook for the UK's public finances is very uncertain. The eurozone crisis continues to pose a significant threat to the economic outlook, and it's possible that the OBR's growth forecasts will prove to be too optimistic. This will inevitably have adverse consequences for public finances and suggests that borrowing may not come down as quickly as the OBR currently expects.</p> <h2>Allan Monks, UK economist at JPMorgan Chase</h2> <p>Although revenues undershot expectations for most of the year, spending was generally also lower than expected. But the last two monthly readings have shown both weaker tax revenues and higher spending. The OBR's forecast for lower borrowing in the upcoming fiscal year, which started in April, implies this recent trend will reverse.</p> <h2>Blerina Uci, UK economist, Barclays Capital<br></h2> <p>We are now 22 months into the five-year fiscal consolidation plan the government announced in June 2010, when it laid out plans to eliminate the structural deficit by the end of the current parliament. To this end it announced tax increases worth \u00a329bn and spending cuts worth \u00a383bn cumulatively over the five-year period. Since then, activity data has been significantly worse than expected \u2013 the OBR has lowered its GDP growth forecast for 2011-12 to 0.5% from 2.4% and its 2012-13 forecast to 1.0% from 2.9%.

      "bodyText": "Government borrowing was higher than expected last month, but downward revisions to previous months meant that over the 2011/2012 year the deficit was bang in line with the \u00a3126bn target. Find out what City economists and Labour made of the numbers. Nida Ali, economic advisor to the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club A lacklustre end to the financial year, with March seeing a slight increase in public borrowing, compared to a year earlier. However, thanks to strong figures in the first 10 months of the financial year, this didn't prevent the chancellor from meeting the OBR's forecast of lowering borrowing to \u00a3126bn in 2011/12. It is discouraging that the rate of increase in central government spending outpaced the rise in tax revenues. A closer look at the release reveals some unpalatable trends. For instance, VAT receipts that until the end of last year, had been boosted by the increased VAT rate, fell in March reflecting weak consumer spending. The outlook for the UK's public finances is very uncertain. The eurozone crisis continues to pose a significant threat to the economic outlook, and it's possible that the OBR's growth forecasts will prove to be too optimistic. This will inevitably have adverse consequences for public finances and suggests that borrowing may not come down as quickly as the OBR currently expects. Allan Monks, UK economist at JPMorgan Chase Although revenues undershot expectations for most of the year, spending was generally also lower than expected. But the last two monthly readings have shown both weaker tax revenues and higher spending. The OBR's forecast for lower borrowing in the upcoming fiscal year, which started in April, implies this recent trend will reverse. Blerina Uci, UK economist, Barclays Capital We are now 22 months into the five-year fiscal consolidation plan the government announced in June 2010, when it laid out plans to eliminate the structural deficit by the end of the current parliament. To this end it announced tax increases worth \u00a329bn and spending cuts worth \u00a383bn cumulatively over the five-year period. Since then, activity data has been significantly worse than expected \u2013 the OBR has lowered its GDP growth forecast for 2011-12 to 0.5% from 2.4% and its 2012-13 forecast to 1.0% from 2.9%. This has led the government to slow the pace of fiscal consolidation in the medium term and the five-year plan has turned into a seven-year plan. The government has eased both the pace of spending cuts and the pace of tax increases \u2013 the net effect has, however, been for fiscal consolidation to last for longer and to be even more severe in the long run (cumulative spending cuts have increased to \u00a3126bn). At the time of this year's budget, the OBR forecast that the government would borrow \u00a377bn more during the course of this parliament than the interim OBR had expected at the time of the June 2010 \"emergency\" budget.

      "bodyText": "There are renewed signs of companies going on a bit of a spending spree, with an oil industry bid and a couple of fundraisings for future acquisitions. Cove Energy, the Mozambique-focused exploration group, has been the subject of a bidding war, but now it has recommended a new \u00a31.12bn, 220p a share offer from Royal Dutch Shell. Shell has increased its original offer following a rival bid from Thailand's state controlled PTT. Cove's directors - who speak for more than 4% of the company - have accepted the bid, while PTT has said it is examining its options in the wake of the Shell move. In the market Cove has climbed 8p to 225p as investors cling on to the hope of a rival offer, while Shell's A shares are 12p better at \u00a321.22. Stuart Joyner at Investec said: The Cove sale process has taken what may be its final turn with a recommended cash offer from Shell. The formal sale process has now concluded and the data room has closed. Competing offers can still be made and the shares will now likely trade to a slight premium on the hope that PTT (now the underbidder) will trump Shell. We raise our target to the bid level of 220p [from 195p] and remain at hold. Meanwhile Capita has lost 29p to 690p after the outsourcing group unveiled plans to raise around \u00a3290m with a placing of around 40m shares. As it reported a 17% rise in first quarter sales, the company said it would use the funds for acquisitions. It spent \u00a3341m on bolt on businesses last year and \u00a391m so far this year.
