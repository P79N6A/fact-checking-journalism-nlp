      "bodyText": "The McArthur River mine in the Northern Territory \u2013 one of the world\u2019s biggest zinc, lead and silver mines \u2013 must shut immediately and owner Glencore must cover the clean-up costs, say traditional owners who will protest outside the company\u2019s headquarters in Sydney on Thursday. Coinciding with Glencore\u2019s annual general meeting in Switzerland on Thursday, a delegation of the four groups that share responsibility for the river \u2013 the Gudanji, Garawa, Yanyula and Mara people \u2013 will be joined by protests in other communities impacted by Glencore mines around the world. Protests will occur in Bangladesh, South Africa, Zambia and London, organising under the banner #makethempay. A 2014 independent report found the mine contaminated the McArthur river, concluding 90% of fish stock in a nearby creek had shown dangerously high levels of lead. Residents and environmentalists have also complained of a large pile of smouldering waste, which the independent report said was polluting surrounding water and emitting poisonous fumes. Glencore then delayed erecting signs warning of the contaminated fish for over a year, despite members of the clans that control the river fishing extensively from it for food. The mining group, which turned five executives into paper billionaires when it floated on the London stock market in 2011, later said it was waiting for regulatory approval from authorities for the signs. Government documents later showed the Northern Territory government and Glencore knew about the signs of contamination but did not fully inform the communities. Glencore now has plans to double the size of the mine, but will need to submit an application to the federal government for approval. The company has denied polluting the river, pointing to other 2014 findings which did not show evidence of \u201cmine-derived lead\u201d in McArthur river and Surprise creek, and only recorded elevated levels in \u201csmall non-eating fish deep within the mine itself\u201d. \u201cGlencore had no right to poison our river and damage the land,\u201d said Gadian Hoosan, spokesman for the Garawa Land Trust, whose land is situated downstream of the mine. \u201cAll four clan groups rely on that river. It was our main food source and livelihood and they took that away from us.\u201d Lauren Mellor from the Mineral Policy Institute\u2019s legacy mines project, said the mine has been a disaster for people living downstream. \u201cInstead of digging itself into a bigger hole by pursuing expansion plans, Glencore must move its operations to a closure and clean-up phase and guarantee rehabilitation of the site.\u201d ActionAid helped facilitate the protests, and have been fighting what they say is Glencore\u2019s \u201ctax dodging\u201d around the world. Archie Law, the executive director of ActionAid, said: \u201cGlencore is robbing communities all over the world of their livelihood and the public funds that should be paying for basic infrastructure and public services.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And finally..... here\u2019s my colleage Jana Kasperkevic on today\u2019s Fed minutes: The US Federal Reserve could rase interest rates as early as June, according to minutes from its April meeting, with Fed members arguing the risks of a slowdown in the global economy have receded. Yet even as the members have become more bullish about US economic resilience, they remained cautious about raising rates. They voted 11-1 to keep interest rates unchanged for a third time this year at the April meeting. The minutes released on Wednesday listed concerns about the slowing growth ofUS economy in the first quarter, Britain\u2019s potential exit from the EU and lingering uncertainty over China\u2019s economy. \u201cSince the March FOMC [Federal Open Markets Committee] meeting, foreign financial market conditions eased, on net, and overall risk sentiment appeared to have improved,\u201d the Fed noted in its minutes. Yet concerns about potential risks of a slowing US economy and global markets remain. Here\u2019s the full story: And with that, goodnight and thanks for reading... GW The New York stock market has closed for the night, pretty much where they started it: The Dow Jones index has only shed 5 points, or 0.03%, at 17,524. The broader S&amp;P 500 index closed flat, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index finished 0.5% higher. Basically, the selloff sparked by the Fed minutes did wipe out early gains, but didn\u2019t prompt a rout. Tariq Zahir, crude oil trader and managing partner at Tyche Capital Advisors, reckons the US dollar could continue to strengthen. He says: \u201cWe think people really had a June rate hike off the table. \u201cBut with the Fed disputing that, we could have a much stronger dollar from here, which is typically bearish for oil and other commodities.\u201d This afternoon\u2019s dollar rally has already driven down commodity prices, and sunk oil\u2019s latest attempt to hit the $50/barrel mark for the first time this year. Brent crude is ending the day down 1.5% at $48.55. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago, has got the Fed\u2019s message, telling Reuters that: \u201cThey are ready to pull the trigger on a rate increase in June.\u201d Poor Janet Yellen.... As Fed chair, she\u2019s going to have to keep a close eye on the nitty-gritty of Britain\u2019s EU referendum battle, points out the FT\u2019s Mehreen Khan. Wall Street now reckons there\u2019s a 25% chance of a June rate hike - up from below 5% last week: The Federal Reserve is pretty clear that Britain\u2019s EU referendum is a potential shock to the world economy, as is China\u2019s slowdown. The minutes state that: [Many policymakers] indicated that they continued to see downside risks to the outlook either because of concerns that the recent slowdown in domestic spending might persist or because of remaining concerns about the global economic and financial outlook. Some participants noted that global financial markets could be sensitive to the upcoming British referendum on membership in the European Union or to unanticipated developments associated with China\u2019s management of its exchange rate.\u201d The next Fed meeting takes place just a week before Britain goes to the polls in a vote that will determine its place in, or our, of the European Union. So the Fed might well judge it too risky to raise borrowing costs after all (as Joseph Lake, US analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, suggested earlier today) The yield, or interest rates, on US government bonds has spiked sharply since the minutes were released. That\u2019s another sign that investors are now expecting American interest rates to rise earlier than before. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange firm World First, reckons the Federal Reserve are trying to signal to the market.... Ironically, by pushing up the dollar, markets create the kind of tighter monetary conditions that allow the Fed to hold off actually raising rates at all..... Investors are rapidly repricing their expectations for US interest rate moves this year. There\u2019s now a greater expectation that borrowing costs could rise during 2016, based on market moves in the last 20 minutes. However, they still don\u2019t think that a June hike is terribly likely, despite the Fed saying that many policymakers think it could be justified if the data improves. CNBC has the details: June rate hike: 26 percent chance, up from 19 percent prior to the minutes being released July: 46 percent chance, up from 38 percent September: 62 percent, up from 57 percent November: 64 percent, up from 60 percent December: 78 percent, up from 74 percent February 2017: 80 percent, up from 76 percent More here: Rate hike odds spike across the board after Fed minutes Shares on Wall Street have erased all their gains after the Fed minutes revealed that a June rate hike is certainly possible. And the dollar is soaring... hitting a nine-week high against the Swiss franc and a three-week high against the yen. Breaking: Policymakers on the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy-setting committee are leaning towards raising interest rates at their next meeting in June. That\u2019s the top line from the minutes of last month\u2019s meeting, which just hit the wires. They show that \u201cmost\u201d policymakers judge that a June rate hike would be appropriate, if data suggest that the US economy is recovering this quarter after its winter slowdown. And some Fed officials are concerned that the markets aren\u2019t ready for a June hike -- that\u2019s true, given many investors only expect one hike in 2016. This is the key quote from the minutes: \u201cMost participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor markets continued to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward the committee\u2019s 2 percent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June.\u201d However, the minutes also show that the Fed is concerned that Britain\u2019s EU referendum could spook the financial markets next month. Nearly time for the final event of the day....the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s April monetary policy meeting. Paul La Monica of CNN hopes we don\u2019t get too carried away... Another mixed day for stock markets, with the FTSE 100 hit by falling commodity stocks in the wake of the strong dollar but a rebound in banks providing support elsewhere. And even the FTSE 100 managed to end virtually unchanged on the day. Tony Cross, markets analyst at Trustnet Direct said: It seems fair to say that today could have been a whole lot worse for equity markets and by all accounts that shock IPSOS/MORI poll on the referendum does seem to have played at least some part in helping ensure the FTSE-100 rounds the day out broadly unchanged. It paints a picture that the remain campaign is quite literally a country mile ahead and whilst the stronger pound has done little to help commodity stocks, many other sectors seem to be finding some solid support off the back of this shift in sentiment. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually flat, down 1.97 points or 0.03% at 6165.80 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.54% to 9943.23 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.51% to 4319.30 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.23% to 17,713.62 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.88% at 8775.1 In Greece, the Athen\u2019s market added 0.31% to 628.29 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currentlyi up 33 points or 0.19%. Meanwhile oil prices have shaken off their earlier dip following a surprise rise in US crude stocks. Brent is now up 0.65% at $49.60 a barrel. More on the Fed: There has been much talk about when the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again after December\u2019s hike, and the minutes of last month\u2019s Fed meeting which will be released later could give further clues. On Tuesday two - albeit non-voting - members said the June meeting was a live one, and two to three rate increases could be expected this year. Along with stronger than expected US data, this seemed to put a June rise firmly on the table. Not everyone agrees, however, with Joseph Lake, US analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, suggesting there will be no move until at least September: All eyes today are on the release of the minutes of the April FOMC meeting, which will give markets an indication of the future direction of interest rates, and the likelihood of a Fed rate rise in June. This will influence the future direction of the US dollar, and have a large bearing on whether commodity prices can sustain their recent rally. Politics will play a key role in when the Fed decides to increase the policy rate. The next FOMC meeting is on June 14-15, just one week before the UK votes on whether it will leave or remain in the European Union. Although the EIU expects the UK to vote to remain in the EU, polls are close and the vote will be tight. This will weigh on financial markets and factor in to the Fed\u2019s decision. It would be risky to lift US interest rates just one week before a UK poll which could have wide ranging consequences for the global economy. Had the domestic economic data been overwhelmingly positive in the past two months, the Fed would probably have moved in June. However, while economic data has been positive, it has not been overwhelmingly so and, combined with the Brexit vote, this will be enough to persuade the Fed to delay the next rate increase. It is unlikely to move at the following FOMC meeting, in July, as it is not accompanied by a press conference. Although the Fed insists that all meetings are live, given the very gradual nature of this tightening cycle, and the importance of clear communication, the Fed will probably skip July, leaving the following FOMC meeting in September as the most likely date of the next policy rate increase. Thereafter, politics will once again enter the Fed\u2019s calculations, but this time it will be domestic matters. The lead up to the November presidential and congressional elections will increase investor uncertainty, and raise volatility in financial markets. Although we think the domestic economic prospects for the second half of 2016 are bright, the uncertainty generated by politics will deter the FOMC from tightening policy at the November meeting, leaving the FOMC gathering in mid-December as the last chance to increase the policy rate for a second time in 2016. A quick look at what is expected at this week\u2019s G7 finance ministers\u2019 meeting in Japan, from Capital Economics. In sum, not much: This weekend\u2019s G7 finance ministers meeting in Sendai, Japan, is likely to focus on exchange rate and fiscal policy and to end with another warning about the dangers of Brexit. However, no major policy announcements are on the cards. In more detail: The hosts, Japan, will be looking for support for the view that currency intervention can be a legitimate policy option in some circumstances. After all, the appreciation of the yen, of 10% so far this year, has been much bigger than that of the euro (and has had a major impact on corporate earnings. And Japanese officials have hinted recently that they may intervene to push the yen down...US officials are not likely to criticise the euro-zone\u2019s or Japan\u2019s exchange rate policy too heavily at this weekend\u2019s meeting because neither the ECB nor the Bank of Japan has been intervening to weaken their currencies. Indeed, the US is more concerned about China, which is of course not a G7 member, though the People\u2019s Bank has been selling foreign currency over the past year in order to prop the renminbi up, rather than trying to gain competitive advantage. All in all, it seems highly likely that the G7 will stick to its established formula on exchange rate policy. The key elements are a commitment to market-determined exchange rates and to using fiscal and monetary policies to achieve domestic objectives. Finance ministers will also discuss fiscal policy, with Germany likely to be singled out for criticism once again. But the Japanese government is unlikely to push for a coordinated statement in favour of fiscal stimulus given implacable opposition from Germany itself. Moreover, Japan is not in a good position to argue for a coordinated fiscal stimulus: under current plans, its fiscal policy will be tightened more than that of any other G7 economy apart from the UK during 2016-2020. Finally, the G7 will surely issue yet another warning about the dangers posed by Brexit. With only five weeks to go until the referendum, getting this in any formal communique\u0301 will be the only significant objective of the UK government. But this would surely do little to change anybody\u2019s view on the merits of Brexit. Oil is still in negative territory following the US inventory figures, but it is not seeing a major slide, with Brent crude down just 0.2% at $49.17 a barrel. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index, said: Crude oil dropped in the immediate aftermath of the latest official US oil inventories report from the EIA as traders responded to the headline build of 1.3m barrels. Clearly this wrong-footed many speculators who had expected to see another drawdown following last week\u2019s 3.41m barrel decrease in US oil stocks. This is the second time in as many weeks that the API has got it completely wrong. [The American Petroleum Institute earlier this week reported a 1.1m barrel drop in US crude oil supplies.] But the other aspects of the oil report were not too bad at all. For a start, oil production fell once again. What\u2019s more, there were larger-than-expected draws in distillates and \u2013 more importantly for this time of the year \u2013 gasoline stocks as refineries processed more crude now that the driving season is underway. Hence, [US benchmark] oil has not exactly fallen off a cliff (yet). Back with the latest shareholder spring, and nearly 32% of the votes cast at Paddy Power Betfair\u2019s annual meeting were against the approval of the remuneration report. Unsurprisingly, oil prices have fallen on the US inventory news. Brent crude, having touched $49.54 a barrel earlier, is now down 0.3% at $49.13. Reuters has the report on the US data: U.S. crude stocks rose unexpectedly last week even as gasoline and distillate inventories fell more than expected, data from the Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday. Crude inventories rose by 1.3 million barrels in the week to May 13, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations for an decrease of 2.8 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 461,000 barrels, hitting a fresh record high, the data showed. Refinery crude runs rose by 192,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates rose by 1.4 percentage points. Gasoline stocks fell by 2.5 million barrels, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations in a Reuters poll for a 150,000-barrel drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 3.2 million barrels, versus expectations for a 642,000-barrel drop, the EIA data showed. U.S. crude imports rose last week by 22,000 barrels per day. US crude stocks have unexpectedly risen compared to expectations of a weekly decline. According to the Energy Information Administration, crude stocks rose by 1.3m barrels to 541.29m compared to forecasts of a 2.8m draw. US oil inventory data is due shortly and the crude price is steadying ahead of the news, given the recent supply problems including the Canadian wildfires. Brent is currently up 0.3% at $49.45 a barrel having earlier fallen as low as $48.88. The US stock market has opened in the red, as Wall Street continues to ponder the possibility of a hike in interest rates. Hawkish comments from some Federal Reserve policymakers yesterday, plus strong inflation data, have reignited talk about higher borrowing costs. We\u2019ll get a better clue at 7pm tonight (2pm Washington time), when the minutes of last month\u2019s Fed meeting are released. In the meantime, the Dow has lost 30 points or 0.2% to 17,499, extending yesterday\u2019s selloff. Bloomberg\u2019s Lucy Meakin has shown how the pound has jumped against all major currencies today, as Brexit fears suddenly ease..... Money is continuing to pour into sterling, after the latest EU referendum poll gave the Remain side a shock 18 point lead. Investors are reacting to the news that 55% of those polled want to stay in the EU, while 37% want so leave, according to IPSOS MORI. The pound has now surged by 1.2 cents against the US dollar to $1.459, up from $1.446 overnight. That\u2019s a two-week high. Sterling has also jumped by 1.5 eurocents against the single currency, to \u20ac1.2935 \u2013 a 10-week high. And the pound is also surging against the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar, sending it to a three-month high against a basket of currencies. Investors are clearly calculating that this poll is a turning point in the EU campaign, and suggests Britain will decide against Brexiting the EU. However, it\u2019s only one poll \u2013 others have suggested that the race is tighter, especially as Leave voters are more likely to actually vote.... Indeed, Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, told the Evening Standard that: \u201cRemain has been boosted by a Conservative swing, but they are also more likely to change their mind, so in this volatile election, with voters divided over the short and long-term impacts of their decision, nothing can be taken for granted.\u201d The test manipulation scandal that is gripping the automobile industry has claimed another casualty. The president of Mitsubishi Motors, Tetsuro Aikawa, has resigned today, four weeks after the company admitted it had falsified fuel efficiency reports for decades. Mitsubishi\u2019s mistake was not to adjust its testing to reflect new rules introduced in 1991 to better reflect stop-start urban driving. Aikawa\u2019s departure \u2013 marked with a traditional Japanese bow \u2013 came hours after rival carmaker Suzuki revealed that it had also used improper methods to test the fuel economy of its vehicles. Shares in Suzuki plunged by 10%. By delaying sanctions against Spain today, the EC could be preparing the ground to rebuke the next Spanish government (if they don\u2019t comply with Brussels\u2019 demands)... Speaking of Europe...Spain and Portugal have just been given more time to get their finances into order. The European Commission had been expected to get tough with both countries for running deficits over the 3% target mandated by Brussels. It could even have imposed its first ever fines against a member state. But with political tensions high in both countries, and the Brexit vote threatening to destabilise Europe, eurocrats have taken a softly-softly approach. Spain, which is holding a general election in June, has now been given until the end of the year to cut its deficit. Portugal\u2019s deadline for fixing its public finances will be extended to 2017 - a boost for its new socialist government. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has admitted that political concerns played a factor: The FT\u2019s Mehreen Khan explains why: The delay will be a source of relief for Madrid, where voters will be heading to the polls in a second general election in just seven months. Spain\u2019s incumbent prime minister Mariano Rajoy was defiant ahead of today\u2019s showdown with Brussels, promising to implement a fresh round of tax cuts should he be re-elected in the summer.... More here: Breaking away from the jobs report, the pound has jumped after a new opinion poll showed a big lead for the campaign to Remain in the EU. IPSOS MORI reports that 55% of the public are planning to vote to stay in Europe in June\u2019s referendum, with just 37% backing Brexit. The poll also found that the public haven\u2019t swallowed some of the more alarmist claims from the two sides. That includes the prime minister\u2019s warning that Brexit would raise the risk of another World War..... Here\u2019s the story. Josh Hardie, CBI Deputy Director-General, reckons that George Osborne\u2019s new \u2018national living wage\u2019 is starting to hit the labour market: \u201cWhile it\u2019s encouraging that employment has risen there are some signs of a softening in the labour market, particularly with job vacancies falling back. \u201cHowever, continued uncertainty could be weighing on hiring intentions. In addition we are seeing evidence that employers are considering the impact of the National Living Wage, introduced last month.\u201d The NLW means that all workers aged 25 and over are now legally entitled to at least \u00a37.20 per hour, which will rise to \u00a39 per hour by 2020. The Department for Work and Pensions have riffled through their old collection of vinyl to give today\u2019s report some musical context: (Disappointing lack of Stone Roses, but otherwise pretty neat) John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, has sent over a handy summary of today\u2019s jobs report. \u201cToday\u2019s data confirms that the great UK job creating machine slowed somewhat in the first quarter of this year, with unemployment flattening off at pre-crisis levels and average earnings growth remaining relatively muted at around 2%. \u201cThe employment rate is still rising, however, reaching record levels of 74.2% in the first quarter, fuelled in part by more women in the 60-64 age group working as the state pension age rises. \u201cContinued strong inflows of workers from other EU countries has also been important, accounting for over half of the net rise in UK employment over the past year. This has helped the economy to grow steadily over this period without sparking inflationary wage pressures. \u201cThe relative cooling of the jobs market in the first quarter may in part reflect worries about the global economy, which reached a peak in January and early February, and in part uncertainty related to the EU referendum outcome, particularly from mid-February onwards once the timetable for this became clear. If these uncertainties abate after the vote on 23rd June, we may see both jobs and earnings growth pick up in the second half of the year.\u201d The pound has dipped a little this morning, despite Britain\u2019s employment rate hitting a record high. Andy Scott, economist at HiFX, says traders are concerned that March\u2019s claimant count was revised high this morning, to show the biggest jump since autumn 2011. Today\u2019s figures continue to show that the UK economy has lost momentum with the claimant count rising by almost 15,000 in March \u2013 the biggest increase for over four years. There was some positive news on average earnings including bonuses which rose unexpectedly, but even if you strip out some potential impact from Brexit concerns, underlying growth has weakened. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, is concerned that wage growth has dipped. It could be a worrying signal.... \u201cThe jobs market has been a standout success for the UK economy in recent years, delivering record levels of employment and one of the lowest jobless rates in Europe. \u201cBut the momentum of job creation has eased in recent months and we still haven\u2019t seen lift-off for wages. \u201cIndeed, real wage growth has slowed in the last year, a development that represents a real risk to the consumer-led recovery.\u201d Ian Brinkley, chief economic advisor at Lancaster University\u2019s Work Foundation, flags up that young people are continuing to get a rough deal: For the first time in many quarters, there was no rise in permanent jobs. All of the increase was for the self-employed and temporary employee workers. With weak hiring it is the young, as usual, who lose out. Overall unemployment remained unchanged at 5.1% but unemployment among 18 to 24 year olds went up from 12% to 12.2%. Brinkley also thinks it\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d that the EU referendum is hurting the labour market. Worsening world trade conditions pushing some export based sectors such as manufacturing into recession and increased costs from the introduction of the National Living Wage are more immediate explanations for employers being more cautious about new hires.\u201d If you adjust for inflation, then average earnings have fallen from their recent peak: Here\u2019s the main charts points from today\u2019s labour force report: Some fascinating historical context from Royal Bank of Scotland: Digging into today\u2019s report, its clear that the employment rate has hit a record high partly because more women are working longer. That\u2019s because of changes to the retirement age, pushing it up to 65 for men and women by November 2018, and then 66 by October 2020 (more details here) The ONS explains: 79.3% of men and 69.2% of women aged from 16 to 64 were in work the employment rate for men (79.3%) was the highest since January to March 2005 the employment rate for women (69.2%) was the highest since comparable records began in 1971, partly due to ongoing changes to the state pension age for women resulting in fewer women retiring between the ages of 60 and 65 It\u2019s also possible that more older people of both gender are having to work longer, of course, for economic reasons, but that isn\u2019t spelled out in today\u2019s report. Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has welcomed this latest rise in the employment total, and the small drop in unemployment: \u201cThese are another record-breaking set of figures, with more people in work than ever before and the unemployment rate is the lowest in a decade at 5.1%. More people in work means that more families across the UK are benefiting from the security of a regular wage and the fulfilment that employment brings. \u201cBut the job is not done, which is why our welfare reforms, such as Universal Credit, are making sure that it always pays to be in work.\u201d Real wages continues to grow in the last quarter, the Office for National Statistics reports. But it\u2019s a mixed picture. Average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain increased by 2.0% in January-March, up from 1.9% in October-December. But if you strip out bonuses, pay rose by 2.1%, down from 2.2% the previous quarter. Today\u2019s report also shows that the number of people out of work dipped by 2,000 in the last quarter, to around 1.69m. That\u2019s 139,000 fewer than for a year earlier. Breaking: The proportion of people in work across the UK has hit a new record high. The latest labour market report, just released, shows that the employment rate has hit 74.2%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. The total number of people in work has risen again, by 44,000 in the last three months, to 31.567 million. Here are other key points from the report, just released: Britain\u2019s unemployment rate remains unchanged at 5.1% in the January-March quarter. Surprisingly, the claimant count (the number of people receiving unemployment benefit) has fallen in April, to 738,000. But March\u2019s claimant count has been revised up, to show a gain of 14,700 \u2013 the biggest monthly rise since September 2011. More to follow.... A new report has warned that Britain\u2019s government is \u201cyears behind schedule\u201d in its bid to halve the employment gap between disabled and non-disabled people. According to the TUC union, the target may not be hit until 2030 - a whole decade later than planned. The Daily Mirror explains: Tory promises to halve the unemployment gap of disabled workers will be missed by a shameful 10 years, research shows. The election manfesto pledge is \u201cyears behind schedule\u201d at current rates of progress, according to a TUC study. Ministers had promised to reach the milestone of halving the employment gap between disabled and other workers by 2020. That would see nearly two-thirds (63%) of disabled people in work by the end of the decade, but the government is on target to miss the target by 11% with just over half (52%) in work. More here: The US dollar has hit a three-week high against the euro, on that renewed talk of an American interest rate hike. This has pushed the euro down to $1.1265, from $1.1311 last night. A weaker euro will be welcomed by the European Central Bank, as it should help exporters and raise inflation. Fashion chain Burberry is under pressure again this morning after it issued yet another downbeat report to the City. Burberry posted a 10% drop in profits for the last financial year, and warned that earnings in the current financial year will be at the bottom of analyst expectations. Shares have slumped by 4%, making it the worst performer on the FTSE 100. The company has been hit by slowing demand in key markets such as China and Hong Kong, where consumer have been cutting back. It tells shareholders that: Burberry\u2019s performance [last year] reflected a difficult period for the luxury sector as a whole as demand slowed in many markets for both cyclical and structural reasons. Burberry is now launching a three year plan aimed at raising revenues, improving productivity and deliver at least \u00a3100m of cost savings. And CEO Chris Bailey warns that he expects \u201cthe challenging environment for the luxury sector to continue in the near term\u201d. More here: World stock markets are sliding this morning as investors begin to worry that America\u2019s central bank might raise interest rates again soon. The FTSE 100 has shed 40 points, down 0.7%, to 6125, which erases all yesterday\u2019s gains. Other European markets are down too, following a selloff on Wall Street last night. The selloff is being driven by speculation that America\u2019s central bank could be closer than thought to raising borrowing costs again, possibly in June. Yesterday Dennis Lockhart, the head of the Atlanta Fed, told reporters he still expects two or three rate hikes before the end of the year. Investors had expected fewer \u2013 quite possibly none \u2013 due to signs of economic slowdown, particularly in an election year. But yesterday\u2019s surprisingly strong US inflation data, which showed core inflation above 2.1%, is causing some rethinking.... Overnight, Japan made a rather spectacular escape from recession. New growth figures showed that the Japanese economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.7% in the last three months (meaning it grew by over 0.4% during the quarter). Economists had only expected growth of 0.3% \u2013 but Japan surprised them with unexpectedly strong consumer spending. Here\u2019s our story: Now the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, must decide whether to press on with a sales tax that could hurt growth but improve the battered Japanese public finances.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The resilience of Britain\u2019s labour market has been one of the more remarkable aspects of the aftermath of the financial crisis. Despite the government\u2019s austerity crackdown, the jobless rate has fallen steadily from 8.4% in autumn 2011 to just 5.1% at the start of 2016. But last month, the unemployment total jumped by a worrying 21,000 while wage growth stalled. And new figures released at 9.30am will show whether this trend is continuing. Economists expect earnings growth (including bonuses) to have slipped again, from 1.8% to 1.7%. The employment total, which has regularly hit record highs, could possibly have bottomed out. And the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit is tipped to have risen by 4,500, on top of a 6,700 jump last month. That might show that jitters over the EU referendum are hitting the labour market, but may also reflect the fact that Britain\u2019s growth appears to be slowing. If the numbers are bad, we can probably expect the government to warn about the dangers of Brexit. And if the numbers are good, we can also probably expect the government to warn about the dangers of Brexit. Also coming up today.... The European Commission is announcing its latest review of national budget policies around 11am BST (I think). This may include penalties against countries who have failed to hit fiscal targets, such as Spain and Portugal.... We\u2019re also getting results from luxury fashion chain Burberry, beermaker SAB Miller and energy firm SSE. And late tonight (7pm BST), the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent meeting are released. That\u2019s quite timely, after US inflation jumped yesterday - putting talk of another rate hike back on the agenda....",

Along with stronger than expected US data, this seemed to put a June rise firmly on the table. Not everyone agrees, however, with Joseph Lake, US analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, suggesting there will be no move until at least September:</p> <blockquote> <p>All eyes today are on the release of the minutes of the April FOMC meeting, which will give markets an indication of the future direction of interest rates, and the likelihood of a Fed rate rise in June. This will influence the future direction of the US dollar, and have a large bearing on whether commodity prices can sustain their recent rally. </p> <p>Politics will play a key role in when the Fed decides to increase the policy rate. The next FOMC meeting is on June 14-15, just one week before the UK votes on whether it will leave or remain in the European Union. Although the EIU expects the UK to vote to remain in the EU, polls are close and the vote will be tight. This will weigh on financial markets and factor in to the Fed\u2019s decision. It would be risky to lift US interest rates just one week before a UK poll which could have wide ranging consequences for the global economy.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ea65c5fa59bd872d20cbb3bd5167e0701dc8336\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ea65c5fa59bd872d20cbb3bd5167e0701dc8336/0_78_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US Federal Reserve building in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US Federal Reserve building in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Had the domestic economic data been overwhelmingly positive in the past two months, the Fed would probably have moved in June. However, while economic data has been positive, it has not been overwhelmingly so and, combined with the Brexit vote, this will be enough to persuade the Fed to delay the next rate increase. It is unlikely to move at the following FOMC meeting, in July, as it is not accompanied by a press conference. Although the Fed insists that all meetings are live, given the very gradual nature of this tightening cycle, and the importance of clear communication, the Fed will probably skip July, leaving the following FOMC meeting in September as the most likely date of the next policy rate increase.</p> <p>Thereafter, politics will once again enter the Fed\u2019s calculations, but this time it will be domestic matters. The lead up to the November presidential and congressional elections will increase investor uncertainty, and raise volatility in financial markets. Although we think the domestic economic prospects for the second half of 2016 are bright, the uncertainty generated by politics will deter the FOMC from tightening policy at the November meeting, leaving the FOMC gathering in mid-December as the last chance to increase the policy rate for a second time in 2016.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573c91eae4b0451a6f482647\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-18T16:05:21.819Z\">5.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A quick look at what is expected at this week\u2019s G7 finance ministers\u2019 meeting in Japan, from Capital Economics.

However, no major policy announcements are on the cards. </p> </blockquote> <p>In more detail:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The hosts, Japan, will be looking for support for the view that currency intervention can be a legitimate policy option in some circumstances. After all, the appreciation of the yen, of 10% so far this year, has been much bigger than that of the euro (and has had a major impact on corporate earnings. And Japanese officials have hinted recently that they may intervene to push the yen down...US officials are not likely to criticise the euro-zone\u2019s or Japan\u2019s exchange rate policy too heavily at this weekend\u2019s meeting because neither the ECB nor the Bank of Japan has been intervening to weaken their currencies.</p> <p>Indeed, the US is more concerned about China, which is of course not a G7 member, though the People\u2019s Bank has been selling foreign currency over the past year in order to prop the renminbi up, rather than trying to gain competitive advantage.</p> <p>All in all, it seems highly likely that the G7 will stick to its established formula on exchange rate policy. The key elements are a commitment to market-determined exchange rates and to using fiscal and monetary policies to achieve domestic objectives.</p> <p>Finance ministers will also discuss fiscal policy, with Germany likely to be singled out for criticism once again. But the Japanese government is unlikely to push for a coordinated statement in favour of fiscal stimulus given implacable opposition from Germany itself. Moreover, Japan is not in a good position to argue for a coordinated fiscal stimulus: under current plans, its fiscal policy will be tightened more than that of any other G7 economy apart from the UK during 2016-2020.</p> <p>Finally, the G7 will surely issue yet another warning about the dangers posed by Brexit. With only five weeks to go until the referendum, getting this in any formal communique\u0301 will be the only significant objective of the UK government. But this would surely do little to change anybody\u2019s view on the merits of Brexit. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573c876ae4b0451a6f482617\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-18T15:22:04.877Z\">4.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oil is still in negative territory following the US inventory figures, but it is not seeing a major slide, with Brent crude down just 0.2% at $49.17 a barrel.</strong> Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Crude oil dropped in the immediate aftermath of the latest official US oil inventories report from the EIA as traders responded to the headline build of 1.3m barrels.

At the Foxtons AGM, where the chief executive, Nic Budden, received a 19% salary increase to \u00a3550,000, 20% of shareholders voted against the remuneration report and the company promised to consult further with investors. At Paddy Power Betfair, 30% of investors voted against the remuneration report, although the figure rises to 40% if deliberate abstentions are included. Shareholders expressed concern about the treatment of bonuses handed out before the merger of Paddy Power and Betfair last year. The company said: \u201cUltimately, key employees were retained, the momentum of both legacy businesses was maintained, the merger completed smoothly and the employees will receive no more remuneration than if the merger had not happened.\u201d Pay is also on the agenda at boardrooms outside the UK, with German carmaker Volkswagen admitting that its needs to change pay policies after 12 current and former board members were paid \u20ac63m, despite the emissions scandal.

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley is understood to have been outbid by rivals including the owners of Matalan and Edinburgh Woollen Mill as administrators try to secure the future of BHS. Sources said Ashley had put in a \u201clow-ball offer\u201d for the business, which collapsed into administration at the end of last month, putting 11,000 high street jobs at risk. Sources said administrators were leaning towards a consortium led by John Hargreaves, the founder of cut-price chain Matalan who has teamed up with Turkish entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Retail, for a last-minute bid. Hargreaves spent several hours on Tuesday meeting senior management and staff at BHS. Bids from Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner Philip Day and a mystery fourth bidder \u2013 which some believe to be a European retailer and others a finance house \u2013 are also thought to be ahead of Ashley in the running. But sources said it was too early to predict the final outcome of the bidding process with administrators not expected to finalise a deal until next week \u2013 later than their deadline of this weekend. Administrators are understood to be considering only bids for the entire business including the brand, in the hope of saving as many jobs as possible. A number of other bidders, thought to include Dominic Chappell, the head of BHS\u2019s former owner Retail Acquisitions and Yousuf Bhailok, a Preston-based property entrepreneur, have dropped out. The 88-year-old retail chain collapsed little more than a year after Green sold it to the little-known collection of financiers, lawyers and accountants, led by Chappell, who has been declared bankrupt at least twice. The fall of BHS, which still has a \u00a3571m hole in its pension fund, is now the subject of inquiries including an Insolvency Service investigation launched by the business secretary, Sajid Javid, and the hearings being held by the two select committees. MPs are expected to summon lawyers, accountants and financial firms who advised companies on both sides of the transaction. The work and pensions committee and the business innovation and skills committee on Wednesday confirmed plans to call 29 witnesses including Chris Martin, chairman of the BHS pension fund trustees and his predecessor Margaret Downes, advisers to Retail Acquisitions and Green, BHS chief executive Darren Topp and his predecessor Richard Price as well as Chappell and Green. Frank Field, chairman of the work and pensions committee, has also written to Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pension Regulator, asking for confirmation that it rejected a restructuring of BHS under which Green would have injected \u00a380m into the company\u2019s pension fund.",

      "bodyText": "The US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as early as June, according to minutes from its April meeting, with Fed members arguing the risks of a slowdown in the global economy have receded. Yet even as the members have become more bullish about US economic resilience, they remained cautious about raising rates. They voted 11-1 to keep interest rates unchanged for a third time this year at the April meeting. The minutes released on Wednesday listed concerns about the slowing growth of US economy in the first quarter, Britain\u2019s potential exit from the EU and lingering uncertainty over China\u2019s economy. \u201cSince the March FOMC [Federal Open Markets Committee] meeting, foreign financial market conditions eased, on net, and overall risk sentiment appeared to have improved,\u201d the Fed noted in its minutes. Yet concerns about potential risks of a slowing US economy and global markets remain. \u201cMany others indicated that they continued to see downside risks to the outlook either because of concerns that the recent slowdown in domestic spending might persist or because of remaining concerns about the global economic and financial outlook,\u201d according to the minutes. \u201cSome participants noted that global financial markets could be sensitive to the upcoming British referendum on membership in the European Union or to unanticipated developments associated with China\u2019s management of its exchange rate.\u201d The US central bank left interest rates unchanged at 0.25%-0.5% for a third time this year when it met in April. After the Fed raised rates from near zero for the first time in almost a decade in December, it was expected to hike rates four times this year. The forecast has since been adjusted to just two hikes in 2016. A recent slowdown in consumer spending also failed to deter Fed members keen on a rate raise. \u201cWhile the recent data suggested markedly slower growth in consumer spending in the first quarter than seen in 2015, most participants expected to see a pickup in the growth rate of consumer spending in coming months in light of the still-solid fundamental determinants of household spending,\u201d according to the minutes. Speaking at a Politico event on Tuesday, the Atlanta Fed president, Dennis Lockhart, and the San Francisco Fed president, John Williams, said there was a possibility of two to three more rate hikes this year. They emphasized that the June meeting would be a \u201clive meeting\u201d where the decision to raise interest rates could be made. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take it off the table,\u201d said Lockhart, adding that \u201cmarkets are more pessimistic than I am\u201d. Williams pointed out that more data would be released before the June meeting. Among the data to be released before the next meeting are revisions of the first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data \u2013 the broadest measure of economic health \u2013 and May\u2019s jobs report. The meeting will take place about a week before the UK votes on whether it wants to leave the EU, known as the Brexit, which according to some Wall Street analysts could delay the interest rate hike. At its next meeting, the Fed will have to determine if a Brexit could have an impact on the US economy, Lockhart said on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to make some judgment as to whether it has the potential to feed back into the US economy in a meaningful way. And if the assessment is \u2018probably not\u2019, then I see no reason why it gets in the way of a real serious discussion in June,\u201d he said. Williams pointed out that if there was too much uncertainty in mid-June, the Fed was scheduled to meet again six weeks later, in July. Both Lockhart and Williams are non-voting members of the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee. Esther George, the Kansas City Fed president, is the only voting member who has voted in favor of increasing interest rates in both March and April.",

    "webTitle": "Christopher Bailey: from Burberry chief executive to chief hatchet man", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry\u2019s Christopher Bailey has two jobs already, chief executive and chief creative officer, and now he has a third: chief hatchet man. Strictly speaking, he can perform the cost-cutting role while wearing his CEO trench coat, but the size of the task is greater after a 10% fall in annual profit and a prediction of another decline to follow. Last year\u2019s modest cost-saving programme was about inspecting his executives\u2019 minibar receipts and trimming a few people\u2019s bonuses, or so it seemed. For 2016-17, the thinking is bolder: remove at least \u00a3100m of hard overheads. The removal period extends as far as March 2019, which might be seen as leisurely. But the exercise will plainly be a shock to a company that has not worried about internal efficiencies during its astonishing 15-year rise from unloved subsidiary of the old Great Universal Stores to winner in the global luxury goods love in. The drop in profits, barely softened by a \u00a3150m share buyback, flows from slower sales in luxury markets such as Hong Kong, Macau and Japan. Burberry is no different from the rest on that score. But the company may have forgotten, or never acquired, basic disciplines. Profits per square foot in the shops are said to dismal by comparison with competitors; Burberry also has wider product ranges than most. Both factors may reflect the company\u2019s history as more of a wholesaler than a retailer. It\u2019s time to adjust to a switch that happened years ago. The share price, down by 2.7% on Wednesday, sits within pennies of its lowest level since Bailey took on his dual role in 2014. Thus, the calls from frustrated investors for Bailey to be given a helper are understandable. To be fair to the man, there is no evidence that Burberry\u2019s fashion edge has slipped while he has been doing double shifts. But a high-ranking retail specialist is probably overdue. Don\u2019t just blame Bailey for the absence. Sir John Peace has been chairman for 14 years and is better placed to explain why Burberry, at the first arrival of tougher trading conditions, has suddenly confessed to serious overcomplexity and an urgent need for reform. Ed Miliband\u2019s surprise legacy: energy switching Woz it Ed Miliband wot did it? Something seems to have happened in the energy market to encourage higher rates of switching. The former Labour leader\u2019s proposal for an energy price freeze was widely condemned as economically illiterate at the time. But his attack on \u201cripoff\u201d energy suppliers in his conference speech of September 2013 is, very roughly, when consumers started to switch in greater numbers. In November 2013, there was a spike in switching. Activity, inevitably, fell in the following months, but an upward trend has been seen since. Energy regulator Ofgem reports that 25% more customers switched suppliers in the first three months of 2016 compared with the same period last year. SSE, one of the big six suppliers, said on Wednesday that it had lost 370,000 customers in the past 12 months. That\u2019s about 4% of its total. British Gas shed 220,000 in the first three months of this year. Both are feeling the heat from the arrival of new, independent suppliers. In the words of SSE, \u201c11 have come to market in the past year alone\u201d. Maybe the new entrants have done it for themselves. Or perhaps the mere fact of an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority (as opposed to the limp remedies) played a role. However, since Miliband was half responsible for the CMA inquiry, he can probably claim some credit. It\u2019s not quite the full political legacy he was hoping for, but, hey, it\u2019s something. Beers all round at SABMiller SABMiller, soon to fall into the AB InBev mash-up, painted its last year of independence as a complete triumph. If one ignores plunging currencies in most of SAB\u2019s emerging markets, that\u2019s a fair assessment. Unfortunately, currency values are a fact of life and pre-tax profits fell by 16% to $4.07bn (\u00a32.79bn). Short-termist shareholders will congratulate themselves for selling out at a good moment. SAB\u2019s advisers and senior staff, sharing $160m in fees and retention payments, will celebrate with something superior to AB InBev\u2019s bland Budweiser. And, since the costs are ultimately on the bidder\u2019s tab, nobody will explain how such a sum could be chalked up. Going out on a high? You bet. The nuclear option for boardroom pay Boardroom pay is too high, says Sir Gerry Grimstone, the chairman of Standard Life, one of the country\u2019s largest asset managers. Well said. But here\u2019s the rider: something akin to \u201cmultilateral nuclear disarmament\u201d is required. Does he mean that meaningful reductions are impossible to achieve \u2013 and he won\u2019t go first?",

      "body": "<p>Burberry\u2019s Christopher Bailey has two jobs already, chief executive and chief creative officer, and now he has a third: chief hatchet man. Strictly speaking, he can perform the cost-cutting role while wearing his CEO trench coat, but the size of the task is greater after a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/18/burberry-to-overhaul-retail-operations-after-10-percent-fall-in-profits-bags\">10% fall in annual profit</a> and a prediction of another decline to follow.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s modest cost-saving programme was about inspecting his executives\u2019 minibar receipts and trimming a few people\u2019s bonuses, or so it seemed. For 2016-17, the thinking is bolder: remove at least \u00a3100m of hard overheads.</p> <p>The removal period extends as far as March 2019, which might be seen as leisurely. But the exercise will plainly be a shock to a company that has not worried about internal efficiencies during its astonishing 15-year rise from unloved subsidiary of the old Great Universal Stores to winner in the global luxury goods love in.</p> <p>The drop in profits, barely softened by a \u00a3150m share buyback, flows from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/15/chinese-slowdown-hits-burberry-sales\">slower sales in luxury markets</a> such as Hong Kong, Macau and Japan. Burberry is no different from the rest on that score. But the company may have forgotten, or never acquired, basic disciplines. Profits per square foot in the shops are said to dismal by comparison with competitors; Burberry also has wider product ranges than most. Both factors may reflect the company\u2019s history as more of a wholesaler than a retailer. It\u2019s time to adjust to a switch that happened years ago.</p> <p>The share price, <a href=\"http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/b/burberry-group-plc-ordinary-shs-0.05\">down by 2.7% on Wednesday</a>, sits within pennies of its lowest level since Bailey took on his dual role in 2014. Thus, the calls from frustrated investors for Bailey to be given a helper are understandable. To be fair to the man, there is no evidence that Burberry\u2019s fashion edge has slipped while he has been doing double shifts. But a high-ranking retail specialist is probably overdue.</p> <p>Don\u2019t just blame Bailey for the absence. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/16/profile-sir-john-peace-experian-controversy\">Sir John Peace has been chairman</a> for 14 years and is better placed to explain why Burberry, at the first arrival of tougher trading conditions, has suddenly confessed to serious overcomplexity and an urgent need for reform.</p> <h2>Ed Miliband\u2019s surprise legacy: energy switching</h2> <p>Woz it Ed Miliband wot did it? Something seems to have happened in the energy market to encourage higher rates of switching. The former Labour leader\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/24/ed-miliband-labour-freeze-prices-2017\">proposal for an energy price freeze</a> was widely condemned as economically illiterate at the time. But his attack on \u201cripoff\u201d energy suppliers in his conference speech of September 2013 is, very roughly, when consumers started to switch in greater numbers.</p> <p>In November 2013, there was a spike in switching. Activity, inevitably, fell in the following months, but an upward trend has been seen since. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/data-portal/retail-market-indicators\">Energy regulator Ofgem reports</a> that 25% more customers switched suppliers in the first three months of 2016 compared with the same period last year.</p> <p>SSE, one of the big six suppliers, said on Wednesday that it had <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/18/sse-sheds-370000-customers-gas-prices-profits-competition\">lost 370,000 customers</a> in the past 12 months. That\u2019s about 4% of its total. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/18/british-gas-owner-cuts-jobs-as-braces-for-pay-row-at-agm\">British Gas shed 220,000</a> in the first three months of this year. Both are feeling the heat from the arrival of new, independent suppliers. In the words of SSE, \u201c11 have come to market in the past year alone\u201d.</p> <p>Maybe the new entrants have done it for themselves. Or perhaps the mere fact of an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority (as opposed to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/watchdog-proposes-capping-gas-and-electricity-prices-for-4m-homes-on-pre-paid-meters\">the limp remedies</a>) played a role. However, since Miliband was half responsible for the CMA inquiry, he can probably claim some credit. It\u2019s not quite the full political legacy he was hoping for, but, hey, it\u2019s something.</p> <h2>Beers all round at SABMiller</h2> <p>SABMiller, soon to fall into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/13/sabmiller-agrees-ab-inbev-takeover-68bn\">AB InBev mash-up</a>, painted its last year of independence as a complete triumph. If one ignores plunging currencies in most of SAB\u2019s emerging markets, that\u2019s a fair assessment. Unfortunately, currency values are a fact of life and pre-tax profits fell by 16% to $4.07bn (\u00a32.79bn).</p> <p>Short-termist shareholders will congratulate themselves for selling out at a good moment. SAB\u2019s advisers and senior staff, sharing $160m in fees and retention payments, will celebrate with something superior to AB InBev\u2019s bland Budweiser. And, since the costs are ultimately on the bidder\u2019s tab, nobody will explain how such a sum could be chalked up. Going out on a high? You bet.</p> <h2>The nuclear option for boardroom pay</h2> <p>Boardroom pay is too high, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/17/standard-life-chairman-says-boardroom-pay-is-too-high\">says Sir Gerry Grimstone</a>, the chairman of Standard Life, one of the country\u2019s largest asset managers. Well said. But here\u2019s the rider: something akin to \u201cmultilateral nuclear disarmament\u201d is required. Does he mean that meaningful reductions are impossible to achieve \u2013 and he won\u2019t go first?</p>",

The owner of British Gas, fresh from rows over annual domestic energy profits, has been awarded rights to explore in the Barents Sea off Norway. Greenpeace said it was astonishing that Centrica would risk the enormous financial costs of a spill in such pristine waters when larger companies such as Shell had recently abandoned operations in the Alaskan Arctic. \u201cMuch bigger players than Centrica have been forced to acknowledge that the frontiers-led growth model is fundamentally flawed,\u201d said Charlie Kronick, an oil campaigner with Greenpeace UK. \u201cThe industry just isn\u2019t capable of exploring in the Arctic safely, let alone profitably, so this folly could raise British bills for the sake of oil and gas which we really, really don\u2019t need.\u201d A spokeswoman for Centrica said it had no plans to drill in the Barents Sea at this time, saying its focus was on concessions further south in the Norwegian and North Seas. But she said that the company would take the utmost care to weigh up any risks if it did look at drilling in the Barents Sea. \u201cClearly, before we started to do anything, we would undertake a comprehensive environmental survey to identify any issues and reduce any potential risk to the environment.\u201d Centrica has been reducing its capital spending on exploration and development spending but says it still needs to find or buy gas if it is going to serve the needs of its 14 million residential customers. Centrica is among a group of oil and gas companies, including the local group Statoil, which have won licences from the Norwegian government. The only other British firm is Tullow Energy.

If the companies are successful in their exploration, northern Norway will enter a new era.\u201d Greenpeace said the credibility of Norwegian ministers had been wrecked by the decision to press ahead with licensing in a sensitive area, although one where there are already two working oil and gas fields: Sn\u00f8hvit and the just-opened Goliat.

      "bodyText": "Burberry is to cut jobs and reduce its product range by up to one-fifth in an attempt to save at least \u00a3100m a year, following a 10% fall in profit. Christopher Bailey, the chief creative officer of the British clothing brand, who also became its chief executive in 2014, said \u201cchange is not a choice\u201d as the market for luxury goods faces challenging trading conditions. The company, famous for trench coats, said it expected profit to come in towards the bottom of market forecasts in the year to March 2017 amid investment in staff training and IT, and a sharp slowdown in China, the retailer\u2019s biggest market. Burberry has been affected by a decline in the number of Chinese tourists visiting its stores in Europe and weak demand in Hong Kong after a change to visa rules. Pre-tax profits fell by 10% to \u00a3421m in the year to 31 March, after underlying revenue for the year declined by 1% to \u00a32.5bn. Bailey, who was previously the label\u2019s creative director, said: \u201c2015/16 was a challenging year for our industry shaped by macro trends including volatile financial markets and geopolitical tensions, as well as changes to dynamics of luxury consumption, not least in Hong Kong.\u201d However, in a show of confidence about the future, the company revealed a 5% increase to its full-year dividend and a \u00a3150m share buyback starting next year. Burberry is aiming to cut annual costs by \u00a3100m by 2019, about 10% of its non-fixed expenses, by simplifying the company\u2019s operational processes, cutting jobs and slimming down the range of products. Burberry would not say where job reductions would come or how many people would be affected, but Bailey said he wanted to eliminate duplication between central, regional and local operations. The company will also bring down the number of products it sells as he puts the entire range under the single Burberry brand this autumn. Previously, catwalk items went under the Prorsum label, while the rest of the collection was split between the London and Brit lines. Staff in stores will be retrained to improve service, partly using IT to give them more information about customers. Bailey said Burberry had the opportunity to improve sales per square foot to a level \u201cmore in line with our peers\u201d by changing the way its stores operated and improving customer loyalty. \u201cPeople want more distinct experiences, newness, more authenticity and a personal relationship with the brands they love,\u201d Bailey said. He acknowledged that Burberry needed to bring in more expertise, particularly in retail and digital, to help improve performance. Bailey declined to comment on rumours that he is seeking a right-hand man or woman, but said: \u201cWe acknowledge that there\u2019s a lot going on in the company and there\u2019s great change ... We have identified skills we need to beef up in the organisation.\u201d He said Burberry was committed to growth and pledged that the brand would increase sales by more than the 2% to 3% expected for the luxury industry as a whole over the next few years. The group said that after successfully relaunching its trench coat and scarves over the past couple of years, it would next focus on bags, a category that is growing faster than clothing and an area of weakness for Burberry compared with its peers.",

Pre-tax profits fell by 10% to \u00a3421m in the year to 31 March, after underlying revenue for the year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/fewer-wealthy-chinese-tourists-hits-burberry-sales-europe\">declined by 1% to \u00a32.5bn</a>.</p> <p>Bailey, who was previously the label\u2019s creative director, said: \u201c2015/16 was a challenging year for our industry shaped by macro trends including volatile financial markets and geopolitical tensions, as well as changes to dynamics of luxury consumption, not least in Hong Kong.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/hands-behind-the-heritage-inside-the-burberry-factory\">The hands behind the heritage: inside the Burberry factory in Yorkshire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, in a show of confidence about the future, the company revealed a 5% increase to its full-year dividend and a \u00a3150m share buyback starting next year.</p> <p>Burberry is aiming to cut annual costs by \u00a3100m by 2019, about 10% of its non-fixed expenses, by simplifying the company\u2019s operational processes, cutting jobs and slimming down the range of products. </p> <p>Burberry would not say where job reductions would come or how many people would be affected, but Bailey said he wanted to eliminate duplication between central, regional and local operations. The company will also bring down the number of products it sells as he puts the entire range <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/03/burberry-invest-50m-new-trenchcoat-factory-leeds\">under the single Burberry brand</a> this autumn. Previously, catwalk items went under the Prorsum label, while the rest of the collection was split between the London and Brit lines.</p> <p>Staff in stores will be retrained to improve service, partly using IT to give them more information about customers. Bailey said Burberry had the opportunity to improve sales per square foot to a level \u201cmore in line with our peers\u201d by changing the way its stores operated and improving customer loyalty.</p> <p>\u201cPeople want more distinct experiences, newness, more authenticity and a personal relationship with the brands they love,\u201d Bailey said.</p> <p>He acknowledged that Burberry needed to bring in more expertise, particularly in retail and digital, to help improve performance. Bailey declined to comment on rumours that he is seeking a right-hand man or woman, but said: \u201cWe acknowledge that there\u2019s a lot going on in the company and there\u2019s great change ... We have identified skills we need to beef up in the organisation.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said Burberry was committed to growth and pledged that the brand would increase sales by more than the 2% to 3% expected for the luxury industry as a whole over the next few years.</p> <p>The group said that after successfully relaunching its trench coat and scarves over the past couple of years, it would next focus on bags, a category that is growing faster than clothing and an area of weakness for Burberry compared with its peers.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European commission has avoided handing a propaganda weapon to those campaigning for Britain to leave the EU by delaying a decision on disciplinary action against Spain and Portugal for breaking budget rules until after the EU referendum. Brussels said the postponement of possible action, which could include fines, was due to the general election in Spain on 26 June, three days after the referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership. The announcement by Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic affairs, that the two countries \u2013 which were badly affected by the eurozone crisis \u2013 would be given more time to repair their public finances will also be a relief to David Cameron. The prime minister has been buoyed by recent polls suggesting that the remain campaign is pulling ahead in the referendum battle, but is keen that potential punishments for countries breaking EU fiscal rules, along with decisions on other potentially toxic topics such as Greece\u2019s debt and migration, should be delayed for just over a month. Following an intervention from Jean-Claude Juncker, the EC president, Moscovici told a news conference in Brussels that the commission did not consider that this was the right moment economically or politically to get tough. The inability of Spain\u2019s caretaker government to take budget decisions ahead of the election justified putting off a decision until early July, he said. Instead, Brussels said it wanted to see further action to reduce borrowing, adding that it would review the positions of Portugal and Spain in early July. They have both failed to reduce their budget deficits below the limit of 3% of national output demanded by the EC. Brussels also granted Italy the maximum flexibility under EU fiscal discipline procedures in response to demands from Rome to be given more space to revive anaemic growth and cope with the cost of taking in refugees. The respite for Spain and Portugal may prove brief, since hardline eurozone countries, led by Germany, are insisting that enforcement action be taken in early July. In theory, the commission could fine the two countries up to 0.2% of their GDP for breaking the rules. Spain was set a target to reduce its budget deficit to 4.2% of GDP in 2015, but is on course for a 5.1% shortfall. Portugal\u2019s 2.7% of GDP target will be breached by 1.7 percentage points. Moscovici cited the Spanish election and the fact that a caretaker government was unable to make decisions on the budget among the factors in the decision to defer action. \u201cWe are proposing new deadlines for both countries to correct their excessive deficits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe propose that each country receives one extra year and one extra year only. The new deadline for Portugal will be 2016, and for Spain, 2017.\u201d Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING, said the decision on Spain made technical sense, since a new government in Madrid would be needed to implement any possible recommendations from the commission. \u201cAt the same time, however, this decision also has a slight air of avoiding a political clash during the election campaign, as [the] Spanish prime minister, [Mariano] Rajoy, has recently caught attention with promises to cut taxes after the elections. \u201cAt the current juncture, with most eurozone countries desperately trying to revive growth and tackle unemployment, today\u2019s decision was in our view the right decision. It is not always a bad thing if barking dogs don\u2019t bite.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The president of Mitsubishi Motors is to step down to take responsibility for the Japanese carmaker\u2019s test-fixing scandal. Tetsuro Aikawa, who became the company\u2019s president and chief operating officer in June 2014, has denied any personal involvement in the scandal \u2013 which involved 625,000 cars over 25 years \u2013 but has apologised to customers and shareholders. His resignation is expected to take effect on 24 June, once it is approved by shareholders. A successor is yet to be announced. The scandal that has engulfed Mitsubishi has widened, as fellow Japanese carmaker Suzuki said it had found discrepancies in its fuel economy testing. About 2.1m vehicles are affected across 16 models. The company said proper testing had since shown that the mileage data did not need amending. Suzuki\u2019s chief executive, Osamu Suzuki, denied faking tests, saying that employees did not intentionally use improper data. \u201cThe company apologises for the fact that we did not follow rules set by the country,\u201d he said. The news sent Suzuki shares down 15% at one stage on Wednesday and they closed 9.4% lower. Suzuki\u2019s improper tests do not affect any models sold abroad. The Japanese government ordered all carmakers to check their mileage tests and re-submit fuel economy readings on all their vehicles by Wednesday, after the Mitsubishi scandal broke in late April. Nissan, Japan\u2019s second biggest carmaker after Toyota, moved in to take a controlling stake in Mitsubishi last week, and vowed to rebuild trust in the company. A month ago, Mitsubishi admitted using fuel-economy testing methods that breached Japanese regulations for 25 years. It manipulated test data for four mini-car models sold in Japan, including two it produced for Nissan. Mitsubishi has since extended its investigation to cover cars made for overseas markets. The carmaker reiterated on Wednesday that top management had not ordered the mileage fraud, saying that aggressive internal targets had put pressure on employees to overstate the fuel economy of its cars. The company also admitted that it did not carefully inspect much of the mileage-testing work that was carried out by a subsidiary. The test manipulation may affect all models sold in Japan, including discontinued ones, it has said. Shares in Mitsubishi have lost more than 30% of their value since the scandal surfaced. Nissan discovered mileage tests had been faked because of a discrepancy with its own tests on Mitsubishi-made minicar models sold under its brand. Mitsubishi came close to collapse in the wake of another scandal more than 15 years ago, when the company admitted systematically covering up customer complaints for more than two decades. It was bailed out by other Mitsubishi Group companies. Recent auto industry scandals \u2022 Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s biggest car manufacturer, shocked the world last September when it admitted cheating in emissions tests to make its cars appear less polluting than they were. The manipulation affects more than 11m diesel vehicles worldwide. A number of other European carmakers, such as France\u2019s Renault and Peugeot along with Germany\u2019s Daimler, are also under scrutiny and some have had their offices raided by anti-fraud investigators. \u2022 A potentially lethal fault with Japanese air bag manufacturer Takata\u2019s product has led to the largest ever car industry recall. Some 63.8m cars are affected in the US \u2013 equivalent to more than a quarter of the country\u2019s vehicles \u2013 and the recall process is expected to last until 2019. The defect causes the air bag inflator to explode in humid conditions and has been linked to a dozen deaths \u2013 11 in the US and one in Malaysia \u2013 and injuries in more than 100 cases. \u2022 General Motors paid a $900m fine in September 2015 to settle US federal criminal charges relating to faulty ignition switches on Chevrolet Cobalts and other models that have been linked to more than 100 deaths. GM has recalled 2.6m vehicles affected by the fault and is paying out $575m to settle 1,385 civil lawsuits related to the defect.",

      "bodyText": "A row over \u201crip-off energy prices\u201d has resurfaced after SSE admitted it had lost 370,000 customers over the last 12 months but still managed to keep its retail operating profits level at \u00a3455m. Critics said that SSE group profits hitting \u00a31.5bn showed that customers who did not switch provider were likely to enrich one of the big six firms that still control over 85% of the market. \u201cSSE\u2019s results show once more that if you don\u2019t switch it\u2019s only your supplier who will get rich. If you stay on standard prices you will get ripped off and overpay massively for your energy,\u201d said Mark Todd, co-founder of price comparison site energyhelpline.com. Peter Earl, the head of energy at comparethemarket.com, agreed: \u201cOur research indicates that consumers have been leaving the big six in droves over the past months, often in favour of smaller challengers \u2013 and SSE\u2019s loss of 370,000 customers in the past year demonstrates that SSE has not done enough in terms of pricing or perceived service levels.\u201d The cost of energy and the behaviour of the large companies has long been a subject of public anger and political debate but bills have generally fallen in the last 18 months, albeit slowly compared with a collapse in commodity prices. An 18-month investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority concluded that there had been overcharging but radical options such as breaking up the big six has been abandoned in favour of lighter measures such as a price cap for those on prepaid meters and encouraging customers to switch to lower cost providers. SSE said its overall group profits before tax and after adjustments were down by 3.3% to \u00a31.5m due to lower gas prices, mild weather and price controls in the distribution side of the business. But the company still raised its annual dividend by 1.1% to 89.4p. SSE said the retail arm has been bolstered by growth in business customers but it had suffered from cutting gas prices to domestic customers earlier this year, its third such reduction in 12 months. Alistair Phillips-Davies, SSE\u2019s chief executive, admitted the company was feeling the heat from newer independent retail supply companies such as First Utility, Ecotricity and Ovo Energy: \u201cThe operating environment presented a number of complex issues, including the impact of low wholesale gas prices and intense retail market competition.\u201d SSE said its retail customer base in Britain and Ireland had fallen from 8.58 million to 8.21 million. The figures are released a month after British Gas revealed it had lost 119,000 last year but an additional 225,000 in the first three months of 2016 alone. But Phillips-Davies also signalled SSE was happier that there was less pressure on the suppliers now that the CMA had finished most of its work and that energy appeared off the frontline agenda in Westminster. Although it had been a challenging year, said Phillips-Davies, \u201csome of the mist is beginning to clear around the legislative, political and regulatory environment and SSE will continue to invest for the future\u201d. The company said it would spend up to \u00a36bn over the next four years on upgrading the UK\u2019s electricity and gas infrastructure, with some of the cash going on new transmission lines and some on wind farms. The company continued to bring new onshore wind capacity and now generates more than a third of its total wholesale power from renewable sources. SSE also announced it would be considering the sale of its stake in the SGN gas distribution business.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s employment rate reached a record high and wages ticked up in March, dashing government claims that the job market was being seriously damaged by the threat of a leave vote in the EU referendum. The number of people employed increased by 44,000 to 31.58 million, while total pay including bonuses edged up by 2%, from 1.9% in February, on the rolling quarter-on-quarter measure used by the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said much of the rise in employment could be attributed to rules forcing women to retire later. In recent years, the government has started to push up the retirement age for women from 60, which has added thousands of people to the employment register who would have previously retired. The employment rate for women reached 69.2% in March, the highest since comparable records began in 1971, the ONS said. A steep rise in the number of workers from the rest of the EU also fuelled an increase in the overall employment rate to 74.2%, a record. The number of migrant workers increased by 224,000 to a record 2.15 million over the past year, compared with a 185,000 rise in the number of Britons working in the UK labour force. Total wages, including bonuses, increased month on month from 1.2% in February following heavy revisions of the data to 2.6% in March, as bonuses paid to City traders took effect. The rebound from a weaker picture in the first three months of the year defied the predictions of City analysts, who expected a further deterioration in total pay to 1.7%. In more good news for the government, unemployment fell slightly to 1.69 million, a decline of 2,000 on the previous month. Last month, the work and pensions secretary, Stephen Crabb, said the rise in unemployment in February, the first for seven months, could be the result of Brexit fears. There would be companies \u201clooking at major investments into the UK who are hanging back and considering whether that\u2019s the right thing to do. So of course that will have an impact\u201d, he said. Jeremy Cook, the chief economist at currency dealer World First, agreed with Crabb\u2019s analysis that the figures were indicative of a listless labour market weighed down by fears of a vote to leave the EU in the referendum on 23 June. \u201cEmployment in the UK could easily be topping out as we head into the UK\u2019s referendum on its EU membership. Naturally, as an economy gets closer to full employment, the incremental gains that can be made in the labour market weaken; record highs of employment see to that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile wages have grown slightly this month \u2026 these numbers are relatively meaningless in the short term. \u201cWe can say wage pressures are building and be content that industries are not losing workers ahead of the referendum, or [experiencing] a near-term slowdown in output, but what was once the crown jewel of UK economic data has been shown to be slightly less lustrous than originally thought.\u201d Laura Gardiner, a senior analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said there were clear signs that the labour market recovery had been slowing in recent months. \u201cWhile uncertainty associated with the EU referendum may well have contributed a little to this cooling, the truth is that employment has been broadly flat since October last year. Given this backdrop, today\u2019s figures instead suggest that the UK\u2019s jobs recovery is reaching its limits,\u201d she said. The senior ONS statistician David Freeman said: \u201cThe employment rate has hit another record high, but this time the increase is quite modest. With unemployment very little changed, that is further evidence the jobs market could be cooling off.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s labour market has reached a plateau. The number of people working has risen slightly to a record level. Regular pay growth has edged down a fraction. The unemployment rate is holding steady at 5.1%. There are two reasons for this. The first is that 2015 was a year in which employment grew by almost 600,000, and a pause for breath was always in prospect after such a rapid increase. Progress towards full employment will inevitably be slower from this point. Secondly, the economy has lost a bit of momentum over the winter. The slowdown has not been dramatic, but enough to make employers think twice about hiring, particularly in sectors such as retailing, hotels and catering, which will be affected by the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. The latest labour market data from the Office for National Statistics covers the period from January to March 2016, so the impact of speculation about Britain leaving the EU, which became particularly relevant in late February, is unlikely to have been a big factor. However, the possibility of a leave vote will keep the labour market in a holding pattern for the second quarter. Research from RBS, which goes back further than official figures, suggests that the only time the employment rate has been higher is when the economy was operating flat out during the second world war. The expansion of the workforce is the result of a number of different trends: the population is rising, Britain has become a magnet for those looking for work elsewhere in the EU and people are working longer before they retire. But wage growth is running a long way behind jobs growth. In the three months to March, regular pay was up 2.1% on the same period in 2015. This represented a slower annual rate of increase than that recorded in the early months of last year. The higher minimum wage, which came into force in April, will push up average earnings for those on the lowest incomes. The Labour MP Frank Field has come up with one suggestion. He is proposing that the Department for Work and Pensions should set up pilot projects bringing together Jobcentre Plus district managers, local authorities and local enterprise partnerships. They would be given a pot of City Deals funding tied to a specific target of boosting real earnings among people who have been helped into work, but are stuck on low pay. Under Field\u2019s plan, case workers would help those on lower pay secure longer hours or move to higher paying jobs, either within the same company or at another in their local area. It is an interesting idea and one worth considering, because whatever the result of the EU referendum on 23 June, the key issue for the UK economy will be how to turn rising employment into rising productivity and rising real wages.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s steel trade body and unions have called on the UK and the EU to take urgent action to stop Chinese steel dumping, after the US government increased tariffs to more than 500%. In an escalation of the trade spat, the US has raised its tariffs on imports of cold rolled steel from China to 522% from 266%, citing a refusal to cooperate with anti-dumping investigations. By comparison, the EU has imposed provisional tariffs on China of 16% for cold rolled steel, which is used to manufacture cars and appliances and in construction. The UK is one of 14 countries that have been blocking EU plans to impose tougher sanctions on cheap Chinese steel imports. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has said it would not be right for the EU to scrap regulations known as the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d, which some countries want to end in order to allow higher tariffs on Chinese steel. Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, welcomed the US move. He said: \u201cThe United States has quickly identified the problem with China dumping steel and imposed effective and robust trade barriers. The EU has been slower and the result is we\u2019re still haggling over tariffs and action to prevent unfairly traded Chinese steel. Britain and the EU need to stop treading on egg shells and take decisive action following America\u2019s impressive lead.\u201d A spokesman for the Community trade union said that unfairly traded Chinese steel was still hurting UK and European steel producers. \u201cWe have repeatedly said that there needs to be swifter and more robust action by the European commission but unfortunately, it\u2019s the UK government that is among the countries preventing this happening due to its continued opposition to ending the lesser duty rule.\u201d At the Unite union, Tony Burke, assistant general secretary with responsibility for manufacturing, said: \u201cThe continued failure to agree to tariffs for Chinese steel reflects really badly on the UK government. It sends out all the wrong signals while we are working day in, day out to try to secure a future for the sector. \u201cOn this, the UK government cannot face two ways. It has to decide where its priorities lie: in giving this core industry a fighting chance or cosying up to the Chinese? When it comes to steel it cannot do both.\u201d US and EU unions, including Unite, will meet at an event in Frankfurt next week to come up with a common approach to China. China\u2019s steel exports reached a record 112.4m tonnes last year, up 19% \u2013 but their value fell 10.5% to $62.8bn (\u00a343.2bn) as a result of falling prices. This has led to a global steel glut, which has plunged European producers into crisis. India\u2019s Tata has put its UK steel factories up for sale, putting thousands of jobs at risk across the country, including more than 4,000 in Port Talbot. There are seven bidders jostling for the business: a management buyout team, steel and property group Liberty House, three foreign steelmakers and two private equity firms. In defiance of the US move, China, the world\u2019s largest steel producer, said it would push on with controversial tax rebates to steel exporters to support the sector\u2019s restructuring after a slowdown in demand at home. China\u2019s ministry of finance said it would continue to implement a tax rebate policy on steel exports to fund a costly capacity closure plan. It plans to eliminate 100m-150m tonnes of annual production \u2013 more than the US produces every year \u2013 over the next five years. The US commerce department said on Tuesday the new duties would in effect increase by more than fivefold the import prices on Chinese-made steel products, which totalled $272.3m in 2015. The department found they were being sold in the US below cost and with unfair subsidies. China\u2019s commerce ministry hit back by expressing its \u201cstrong dissatisfaction\u201d with the move. It said: \u201cThe United States adopted many unfair methods during the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese products, including the refusal to grant Chinese state-owned firms a differentiated tax rate.\u201d Analysts said the US duty increase would not have a big impact on China\u2019s overall steel exports because its shipments to the US account for just 2% of the total. The Group of Seven leading industrial countries plans to discuss the steel glut when it meets in Japan this month. China denies that its mills have been dumping their products in other countries, arguing that its steelmakers are more efficient.",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s steel trade body and unions have called on the UK and the EU to take urgent action to stop Chinese steel dumping, after the US government increased tariffs to more than 500%.</p> <p>In an escalation of the trade spat, the US has raised its tariffs on imports of cold rolled steel from China to 522% from 266%, citing a refusal to cooperate with anti-dumping investigations. By comparison, the EU has imposed provisional tariffs on China of 16% for cold rolled steel, which is used to manufacture cars and appliances and in construction.</p> <p>The UK is one of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tata-steel-uk-government-accused-of-failing-to-protect-british-workers-by-blocking-eu-plans-to-allow-a6962446.html\">14 countries that have been blocking EU plans to impose tougher sanctions</a> on cheap Chinese steel imports. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sajid-javid\">Sajid Javid</a>, the business secretary, has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/10/david-cameron-accused-failing-uk-steel-industry-blocking-eu-lesser-duty-proposal\">it would not be right for the EU to scrap regulations</a> known as the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d, which some countries want to end in order to allow higher tariffs on Chinese steel.<br></p> <p>Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, welcomed the US move. He said: \u201cThe United States has quickly identified the problem with China dumping steel and imposed effective and robust trade barriers. The EU has been slower and the result is we\u2019re still haggling over tariffs and action to prevent unfairly traded Chinese steel. Britain and the EU need to stop treading on egg shells and take decisive action following America\u2019s impressive lead.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Community trade union said that unfairly traded Chinese steel was still hurting UK and European steel producers. </p> <p>\u201cWe have repeatedly said that there needs to be swifter and more robust action by the European commission but unfortunately, it\u2019s the UK government that is among the countries preventing this happening due to its continued opposition to ending the lesser duty rule.\u201d</p> <p>At the Unite union, Tony Burke, assistant general secretary with responsibility for manufacturing, said: \u201cThe continued failure to agree to tariffs for Chinese steel reflects really badly on the UK government. It sends out all the wrong signals while we are working day in, day out to try to secure a future for the sector.</p> <p>\u201cOn this, the UK government cannot face two ways. It has to decide where its priorities lie: in giving this core industry a fighting chance or cosying up to the Chinese? When it comes to steel it cannot do both.\u201d</p> <p>US and EU unions, including Unite, will meet at an event in Frankfurt next week to come up with a common approach to China.</p> <p>China\u2019s steel exports reached a record 112.4m tonnes last year, up 19% \u2013 but their value fell 10.5% to $62.8bn (\u00a343.2bn) as a result of falling prices.<br></p> <p>This has led to a global steel glut, which has plunged European producers into crisis. India\u2019s Tata has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/tata-set-to-announce-sale-of-uk-steel-business-port-talbot\">put its UK steel factories up for sale</a>, putting thousands of jobs at risk across the country, including more than 4,000 in Port Talbot. There are <a href=\"http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/seven-bidders-Tata-Steel-s-UK-business-revealed/story-29279249-detail/story.html\">seven bidders jostling for the business</a>: a management buyout team, steel and property group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/06/sanjeev-gupta-uk-steel-tata\">Liberty House</a>, three foreign steelmakers and two private equity firms.</p> <p>In defiance of the US move, China, the world\u2019s largest steel producer, said it would push on with controversial tax rebates to steel exporters to support the sector\u2019s restructuring after a slowdown in demand at home.</p> <p> China\u2019s ministry of finance said it would continue to implement a tax rebate policy on steel exports to fund a costly capacity closure plan. It plans to eliminate 100m-150m tonnes of annual production \u2013 more than the US produces every year \u2013 over the next five years.</p> <p>The US commerce department said on Tuesday the new duties would in effect increase by more than fivefold the import prices on Chinese-made steel products, which totalled $272.3m in 2015. The department found they were being sold in the US below cost and with unfair subsidies. <br></p> <p> China\u2019s commerce ministry hit back by expressing its \u201cstrong dissatisfaction\u201d with the move. It said: \u201cThe United States adopted many unfair methods during the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese products, including the refusal to grant Chinese state-owned firms a differentiated tax rate.\u201d <br></p> <p>Analysts said the US duty increase would not have a big impact on China\u2019s overall steel exports because its shipments to the US account for just 2% of the total.</p> <p> The Group of Seven leading industrial countries plans to discuss the steel glut when it meets in Japan this month. </p> <p>China denies that its mills have been dumping their products in other countries, arguing that its steelmakers are more efficient. </p>",

Weak pay growth, a drop in savings, and higher prices weighed heavily on family budgets in May, the survey by Markit found. The headline index on personal finances \u2013 where anything below 50 indicates decline \u2013 fell to 42.3 in May from 45.1 in April. It was the lowest level in 22 months, described by Markit as \u201ca substantial deterioration in financial wellbeing\u201d. Philip Leake, economist at the research company, said: \u201cIn a period of heightened uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum, Markit\u2019s household finance index pointed to a marked financial squeeze in May, but households\u2019 expectations for the year ahead were little-changed since April. \u201cUnderlying data highlighted stronger price pressures as a key reason behind the downturn. Current inflation perceptions picked up to a 17-month high. Along with higher prices, households reported weak pay growth and a sharper drop in savings.\u201d The tighter squeeze on personal finances was broad-based and felt by employees of all job sectors included in the survey and across all regions of the UK. People working in media and culture jobs were the most pessimistic, closely followed by people working in the retail industry. The biggest declines in personal finances were felt in Wales, followed by London. Households said a pick-up in price pressures was weighing on finances, with inflation perceptions at the highest in 17 months. UK inflation was steadily picking up from a low of -0.1% in October 2015, until official figures published on Tuesday revealed the first drop in annual inflation in seven months in April. The consumer prices index fell to 0.3% from 0.5% in March. The Markit report also revealed a sharp drop in household savings, which fell at the fastest rate since September 2014. The outlook for financial wellbeing over the next 12 months was a little less bleak, nudging up to 49.6 in May, from 49.5 in May. Public sector workers were more gloomy about the future than those in the private sector, Markit said. \u201cDownbeat sentiment was recorded overall in spite of sustained optimism in the private sector \u2013 largely due to greater pessimism among public sector workers.\u201d Despite the view among households that inflationary pressures were building, they pushed back their expectations for a rise in UK interest rates. The proportion of those expecting a rate hike in the next six months dropped to 22% in May from 25% in April. Looking further ahead, 46% of households thought the Bank of England would raise rates within the next 12 months, down from 51% in April.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Leading shares are falling back as the strong dollar, lifted by renewed talk of a US rate rise in June, hits the mining sector. But among the risers is Arm, up 6p at 934p as the chip designer announced the $350m purchase of imaging specialist Apical. Arm said Apical\u2019s technology is used in more than 1.5bn smartphones and 300m other devices including cameras and tablets. Arm said the move supported its long term growth strategy by giving it access to imaging products for driverless cars, security systems, robotics, mobile and other applications. Arm chief executive Simon Segars said: Computer vision is in the early stages of development and the world of devices powered by this exciting technology can only grow from here. Apical is at the forefront of embedded computer vision technology, building on its leadership in imaging products that already enable intelligent devices to deliver amazing new user experiences. But long term seller Liberum questioned the price paid: Apical is a UK-based business, founded in 2002 and has 100 employees. No financials/numbers are given in the release but according to Companies House Apical had revenue of \u00a316.6m in 2015 (March year end) and operating profit of \u00a38.7m. Arm is therefore paying 14.5 times enterprise value/sales and 28 times enterprise value/EBIT, or \u00a32.4m per employee. Apical\u2019s products are targeting intelligent vision for smartphones, connected cars, robots etc. Many other companies (CEVA, Qualcomm, Imagination) are developing products for this area. Computer vision is a very hot space at present and Arm appears to have paid a high price to get into the market. Overall the FTSE 100 has dropped 40.39 points to 6127.38, after mixed UK jobless and earnings news. With the dollar strengthening mining shares were among the leading fallers, with Anglo American down 38.2p at 590.5p and Glencore 5.75p lower at 130.75p. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: The FTSE-100 has started the session sharply lower with the vast majority of constituents sitting firmly in negative territory. Wall Street closed in a rather downbeat mood yesterday amidst escalating fears that the Fed could be on course to hike interest rates in June \u2013 something that we may get a bit more visibility of in tonight\u2019s FOMC minutes release \u2013 and this is really setting the pace. Natural resources stocks would suffer off the back of a rate hike as this would not only strengthen the dollar but also push up borrowing costs for many emerging markets, so it\u2019s little surprise that it\u2019s the miners that have been left scattered across the foot of the index, although ongoing support for oil prices is at least leaving the energy stocks out of the fray. Burberry has dropped 21p to \u00a311.22 after a disappointing update and a restructuring. Richard Hunter, head of research at Wilson King Investment Management, said: Burberry\u2019s recent chequered history continues as the beleaguered company looks to within for progress.The ambitious cost cutting programme will be aligned with an attempt to boost productivity, but in the meantime metrics such as earnings per share and profits have moved in the wrong direction, largely attributed to a challenging environment and, as previously flagged, Hong Kong in particular. Despite the obvious difficulties, however, revenues have remained broadly flat, margins are still comfortable even if declining, and the share buyback programme should be supportive. The increase to the dividend, currently yielding a respectable 3.5%, is confirmation of Burberry\u2019s confidence on future prospects. .. The shares have yet to benefit from this renewed optimism... The return of the Asian consumer to previous spending habits is far from clear and may well prove something of a drag until evident. As such, the current market consensus of the shares as a hold is likely to remain in place for the time being. Elsewhere easyJet has climbed 11p to \u00a314.48 after RBC raised its target price from \u00a315 to \u00a315.50 with an outperform rating. But British Airways owner International Airlines Group is down 3.5p at 515p despite Qatar Airways announcing it had increased its stake from 12% to 15%. Credit Suisse was positive about the move: Deepening relationship between Qatar Airways and IAG [is] likely to result in revenue synergies...We see Qatar as building its holding in IAG with a view to ultimately supplementing the existing cargo joint venture between the carriers (and codeshares between BA, Iberia, Vueling and Qatar) with a passenger-focussed joint business likely providing transfer services for IAG airlines onward from Doha to APAC and African destinations that cannot justify service with IAG metal. Among the mid-caps cash and carry group Booker has jumped 6% to 174.8p after Goldman Sachs upgraded from neutral to buy and raised its target price from 171p to 198p.",

Arm said Apical\u2019s technology is used in more than 1.5bn smartphones and 300m other devices including cameras and tablets.</p> <p>Arm said the move supported its long term growth strategy by giving it access to imaging products for driverless cars, security systems, robotics, mobile and other applications. Arm chief executive Simon Segars said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Computer vision is in the early stages of development and the world of devices powered by this exciting technology can only grow from here. Apical is at the forefront of embedded computer vision technology, building on its leadership in imaging products that already enable intelligent devices to deliver amazing new user experiences.</p> </blockquote> <p>But long term seller Liberum questioned the price paid:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apical is a UK-based business, founded in 2002 and has 100 employees. No financials/numbers are given in the release but according to Companies House Apical had revenue of \u00a316.6m in 2015 (March year end) and operating profit of \u00a38.7m. Arm is therefore paying 14.5 times enterprise value/sales and 28 times enterprise value/EBIT, or \u00a32.4m per employee. </p> <p>Apical\u2019s products are targeting intelligent vision for smartphones, connected cars, robots etc. Many other companies (CEVA, Qualcomm, Imagination) are developing products for this area.</p> <p>Computer vision is a very hot space at present and Arm appears to have paid a high price to get into the market.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has dropped 40.39 points to 6127.38, after <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/18/markets-us-rate-hike-talk-uk-unemployment-report-business-live?page=with:block-573c27f8e4b0670dcbee9401#block-573c27f8e4b0670dcbee9401\">mixed UK jobless and earnings news.</a></strong></p> <p>With the dollar strengthening mining shares were among the leading fallers, with <strong>Anglo American</strong> down 38.2p at 590.5p and<strong> Glencore</strong> 5.75p lower at 130.75p. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The FTSE-100 has started the session sharply lower with the vast majority of constituents sitting firmly in negative territory. Wall Street closed in a rather downbeat mood yesterday amidst escalating fears that the Fed could be on course to hike interest rates in June \u2013 something that we may get a bit more visibility of in tonight\u2019s FOMC minutes release \u2013 and this is really setting the pace. Natural resources stocks would suffer off the back of a rate hike as this would not only strengthen the dollar but also push up borrowing costs for many emerging markets, so it\u2019s little surprise that it\u2019s the miners that have been left scattered across the foot of the index, although ongoing support for oil prices is at least leaving the energy stocks out of the fray.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Burberry </strong>has dropped 21p to \u00a311.22 after<strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/18/burberry-to-overhaul-retail-operations-after-10-percent-fall-in-profits-bags\"> a disappointing update and a restructuring.</a></strong> Richard Hunter, head of research at Wilson King Investment Management, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Burberry\u2019s recent chequered history continues as the beleaguered company looks to within for progress.The ambitious cost cutting programme will be aligned with an attempt to boost productivity, but in the meantime metrics such as earnings per share and profits have moved in the wrong direction, largely attributed to a challenging environment and, as previously flagged, Hong Kong in particular. Despite the obvious difficulties, however, revenues have remained broadly flat, margins are still comfortable even if declining, and the share buyback programme should be supportive. The increase to the dividend, currently yielding a respectable 3.5%, is confirmation of Burberry\u2019s confidence on future prospects. .. </p> <p>The shares have yet to benefit from this renewed optimism... The return of the Asian consumer to previous spending habits is far from clear and may well prove something of a drag until evident. As such, the current market consensus of the shares as a hold is likely to remain in place for the time being.</p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>easyJet</strong> has climbed 11p to \u00a314.48 after RBC raised its target price from \u00a315 to \u00a315.50 with an outperform rating. But British Airways owner <strong>International Airlines Group</strong> is down 3.5p at 515p despite Qatar Airways announcing it had increased its stake from 12% to 15%. Credit Suisse was positive about the move:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Deepening relationship between Qatar Airways and IAG [is] likely to result in revenue synergies...We see Qatar as building its holding in IAG with a view to ultimately supplementing the existing cargo joint venture between the carriers (and codeshares between BA, Iberia, Vueling and Qatar) with a passenger-focussed joint business likely providing transfer services for IAG airlines onward from Doha to APAC and African destinations that cannot justify service with IAG metal. </p> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps cash and carry group <strong>Booker</strong> has jumped 6% to 174.8p after Goldman Sachs upgraded from neutral to buy and raised its target price from 171p to 198p.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labor plans to introduce a \u201cnational interest test\u201d for all energy companies that want to expand their export facilities to sell more of Australia\u2019s natural gas overseas. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, says local manufacturers are being crushed by the current regime because they\u2019re failing to secure reliable gas supplies at competitive prices, forcing many local businesses to close down while household prices are being pushed up. Labor would establish a domestic gas review board to consider whether any new gas export facility, or proposal to expand an existing one, would meet Australia\u2019s national interest, Bowen said. It would also require foreign companies to say how much gas they plan to make available for local manufacturers and households. But Bowen stopped short of calling for gas quotas to be introduced to force energy companies to sell an agreed amount of gas to local manufacturers. \u201cNatural gas belongs to all Australians. We want to ensure it\u2019s extracted in the national interest,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cWe want to ensure that we don\u2019t face a situation in the future, as has been predicted, that more and more manufacturing facilities face closure, not only because of the price of gas but because they just can\u2019t get any gas.\u201d The proposed review board would operate in a similar way to the Foreign Investment Review Board, which considers the national benefit of foreign investment proposals. It would require energy companies to demonstrate how their newly expanded export facilities would boost Australia\u2019s exports and national income, increase the overall gas supply, and deliver a \u201cpredictable and affordable source of gas\u201d for local manufacturers. Bowen says other western countries already have a domestic gas national interest test, including the United States and Canada. It will cost $2.4m over four years to implement, he says. \u201cAfter nearly three years in government the Liberals have refused to recognise the impact soaring LNG exports are having on Australian businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to protect local LNG exporters, local manufacturing businesses and households.\u201d Australia is the world\u2019s second-largest LNG exporter and is expected to become the world\u2019s largest LNG exporter by 2020. Prior to becoming a world leader in LNG exports, much of the gas produced up and down Australia\u2019s eastern seaboard was not linked to international markets and was instead used purely for domestic consumption, giving local manufacturers access to an affordable and predictable source of energy, helping them compete in the global marketplace. Labor says the LNG export boom has put that gas supply at risk, and manufacturers are complaining they can\u2019t secure reliable supplies of gas anymore for long periods of time. Labor\u2019s new policy will go some way to placating demands from the Australian Workers\u2019 Union to reserve a proportion of Australia\u2019s gas for domestic use at affordable prices. The AWU\u2019s national secretary, Scott McDine, said the AWU has been leading the Reserve Our Gas campaign that has been pushing for the government to legislate and create the option to reserve natural gas for domestic use. \u201cAustralia finds itself the only developed nation on the planet which allows gas exporters to extract our gas and sell it to the highest international bidder without any restriction whatsoever,\u201d McDine said. \u201cAustralian households and industry are being forced to match the highest international prices for our own gas. Last month, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found that gas suppliers on the east coast of Australia have used a market restructure to hike prices on domestic consumers, with evidence pipeline operators have set monopoly prices. It said the lack of competition in the local gas market even warranted consideration of whether joint marketing by one of the largest suppliers, the Gippsland Basin joint venture between Esso Australia and BHP Billiton Petroleum, had substantially lessened competition.",

The cash rate is already at a record low of 1.75% after the RBA lowered it by 0.25% on 3 May in the wake the biggest fall in inflation for seven years. David Bassanesse at the investment group Betashares said the RBA was for the first time trying to encourage higher rather than a lower wage inflation. \u201cThat\u2019s why the RBA cut interest rates earlier this month even though the economy is growing reasonably well, and it\u2019s why it will likely cut again. Trend growth and steady unemployment is insufficient to boost the pace of wage growth and hence inflation over time,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, the RBA is effectively targeting a decline in the unemployment rate and higher wages \u2013 which is only possible through a return to above-trend economic growth. Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, agreed and noted that Australia\u2019s economy was following a trend in other developed economies where improving labour markets and falling unemployment rates had not translated into higher wages. \u201cToday\u2019s data will be seen as increasing the possibility of another rate cut by the RBA, perhaps as soon as August,\u201d he said. \u201cLower wages will tend to entrench reduced price pressure throughout the economy. As the inflation outlook declines, employers will be more likely to offer sub 2% annual wage rises. \u201cSoft wage growth also tends to weigh on consumer confidence and spending.\u201d The wage price figures came the day after the RBA had expressed confidence that a forecast pickup in economic growth and downward drift in unemployment would start to lift wages growth within a couple of years. The minutes of its 3 May policy meeting, released on Tuesday, said: \u201cIn addition, information from the bank\u2019s business liaison suggested that firms generally had been unwilling to make offers of wage growth below two per cent.\u201d But Wednesday\u2019s ABS figures show the bank\u2019s confidence may be misplaced because wages growth among businesses had already fallen below the 2% pace well before the RBA\u2019s board had even met. The outlook for wages is a key plank in the RBA\u2019s forecast for price inflation, which in turn feeds into its interest rate decisions. The RBA wants to boost economic growth to head off a vicious cycle of lower expectations feeding into smaller wage and price rises, which in turn validate and entrench those expectations.",
