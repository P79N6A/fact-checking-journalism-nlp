      "bodyText": "Lush has threatened to focus its planned expansion outside the UK because of the government\u2019s \u201clack of clarity\u201d over Brexit. The British cosmetics firm said it is exploring options for growth abroad, blaming the government for not having a viable exit plan. It also revealed that more than 80 of its staff took up an offer to move to its new factory in Germany as a direct reaction to the result. The company, based in Poole, Dorset, said last year\u2019s referendum sent shockwaves through the business, in particular the 20% of its staff who do not hold British citizenship who \u201csuddenly felt unwelcome and understandably upset\u201d. Lush, known for its fizzing bath bombs and ethical approach, offered those wishing to leave the country after the vote positions in its new factory in Dusseldorf, with more than 80 staff to date having taken the opportunity to move. In a statement, the company said its focus in 2017 is to \u201clook after and invest in\u201d its staff, \u201cparticularly in the current political climate\u201d. The group also warned that leaving the EU would mean higher taxes and could jeopardise expansion in Britain. The statement said: \u201cTo date Lush has flourished from the freedom of movement of people and goods, and now we face uncertainty in both of these areas. The negotiation of new trade agreements could take years, but the risk is that we will be paying more import duties across the business. \u201cWith Britain close to full employment and with a severe skills shortage we are concerned that restrictions on free movement of people will impact the availability of both the skilled and the unskilled restricting future growth in both our UK manufacturing and buying facilities. \u201cHaving opened our new Germany manufacturing facility during the year we will be reviewing other options for growth outside of the UK. With little clarity on the government\u2019s approach to the implementation of Brexit this remains a key uncertainty for the business going forward.\u201d In Poole, where Lush is headquartered, 58% of voters opted to leave. The company employs around 1,400 people in the Dorset town and 4,057 in the UK as a whole. About a third of those employed in Poole and 20% of its UK employees (782) are not British citizens. Immediately following the vote, co-founder Mark Constantine expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d and a \u201csense of sadness at the loss of opportunity\u201d. The company, which has 928 stores across 49 countries globally, has not suffered so far as a result of the vote. Its annual results continued to show growth in both sales and profits. Brand turnover rose 26% to 723.3m and group turnover rose 21% to 394.9m in the year ended 30 June 2016. Lush said pre-tax profit for the year to 30 June rose 76% to \u00a343.2m, despite troubles in its Japan operations. In terms of trading it said it had not noticed a material impact on UK revenues since the Brexit vote, and higher costs of raw material imports \u2013 a result of sterling weakness \u2013 were being offset by the cheaper cost of exports. It also confirmed it would be paying the living wage, as set by the Living Wage Foundation, for all UK permanent staff from April 2017, and would be increasing parental leave and childcare funding benefits.",

      "bodyText": "Charlotte Hogg faces a crucial 24 hours for her future as MPs prepare to publish a report into whether she is suitable to hold the post of deputy governor of the Bank of England. Hogg has been braced for criticism since her admission to MPs on the Treasury select committee that she had she failed to disclose potential conflicts of interest. The committee is expected to deliver its opinion on Hogg\u2019s suitability for the post on Tuesday. Although the MPs have only an advisory role, a tough response could put pressure on the 46-year-old to withdraw her candidacy. One committee member said on Monday evening that Hogg\u2019s promotion had to be scrapped. \u201cFeelings have undoubtedly hardened and I cannot possibly see how her promotion can go ahead,\u201d said Labour MP John Mann. Mann described her position as untenable when her breach of the Bank\u2019s code of conduct was revealed last week. In a hearing last month, Hogg had told the Treasury select committee that she had disclosed to the Bank that her brother Quintin Hogg worked at Barclays. But days later she was forced to write to admit that she had not made the disclosure \u2013 and had breached the code of conduct she had helped drawn up when she joined the Bank of England in 2013 as chief operating officer. In an attempt to draw a line under the matter, Bank of England governor Mark Carney issued Hogg with a verbal warning after her admission. Last week at a hearing with MPs, members of the Bank\u2019s court \u2013 which oversees its management \u2013 had defended her position. Bradley Fried, deputy chairman of the Court, said that while her role should not be altered, the events of the recent days \u201cwill go down as a watershed moment in Ms Hogg\u2019s professional and public life\u201d. Hogg is part of the new team brought in by Carney when he arrived from Canada in 2013. Her career includes a spell at Spanish bank Santander, credit checking business Experian, and a stint working in the US. Both her parents are peers. Her father is Douglas, who retired from parliament shortly after the expenses scandal, and is the 3rd Viscount Hailsham. Her mother, Sarah Hogg, now a baroness, headed John Major\u2019s No 10 policy unit and then become the first woman to chair a FTSE 100 company.",

    "webTitle": "Employment agency at centre of Sports Direct scandal axed by Amazon", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Transline Group, one of the employment agencies at the centre of the Sports Direct scandal, has been axed from supplying temporary warehousing staff to Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer. Transline workers deployed in five of Amazon\u2019s 12 UK warehouses are to be transferred to two rival employment agencies over the coming days and weeks in the latest blow to the recruitment group that was exposed by the Guardian in December 2015 for failing to pay its workers at Sports Direct the national minimum wage. The decision, which has been taken in the past few days, will affect Transline workers at two sites in Doncaster plus one each in Peterborough, Swansea and Dunfermline. It is not known how many workers are involved, but the employment agencies benefiting from the change are understood to be Adecco and PMP. A spokesman for Amazon said: \u201cWe do not comment on our relationships with suppliers.\u201d However, the decision to replace Transline was confirmed by an anonymous insider, who said that the agency had been discarded as part of a routine review. The move will be seen as Transline\u2019s biggest setback since the Sports Direct revelations. The expos\u00e9s prompted a parliamentary inquiry by the business, innovation and skills select committee, which concluded that the workers at the sportswear retailer\u2019s \u201cVictorian workhouse\u201d were treated \u201cwithout dignity or respect\u201d. Transline, which supplied around half of Sports Direct\u2019s 3,000 warehouse workers at the time of the scandal, was also accused of misleading MPs during the inquiry, which prompted the committee chairman, Iain Wright MP, to call on Sports Direct\u2019s founder, Mike Ashley, to axe the firm. In a letter to the controversial billionaire, Wright wrote: \u201cWe ask you to think seriously about continuing to use Transline, a company that treats their workers and conducts its business in a way that is inconsistent with your own aspirations for Sports Direct to be on a par with likes of Selfridges and John Lewis.\u201d Transline, which denied ever misleading parliament, supplies far fewer workers to Amazon than to Sports Direct, as the former uses a smaller proportion of temporary workers. Transline confirmed it was still supplying Sports Direct, but did not respond to invitations to comment specifically on its Amazon contract. The employment firm is one of the largest in its sector, and its clients have also included other top names including the high street chain Argos and the online fashion group Asos. Many large retailing businesses use temporary employment agencies, particularly around busy shopping periods, as it gives the flexibility to take on more staff to meet increased demand. Transline was co-founded in 1989 by Paul Beasley, 50, and Jonathan Taylor, 48, who, along with a third director, the 49-year-old sales boss, Mark Elms, each held 5% of the company the last time it released details of individual shareholders in April 2016. The remaining 85% of the equity in the business was then held by Beasley\u2019s father, Colin, 72, who remains the majority owner of the business, which turned over almost \u00a3230m in 2015.",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s pledge to protect England\u2019s pubs by giving them a \u00a31,000 business rates discount has been described as a \u201cstay of execution\u201d rather than long-term support by a Labour MP, as new industry estimates suggested thousands of businesses would get no help at all. Jim McMahon said it was welcome that chancellor Philip Hammond had shown some recognition of the pressures on pubs in last week\u2019s budget when he announced those with a rateable value of less than \u00a3100,000 would receive a \u00a31,000 discount on their business rates bill this year. But the MP for Oldham West and Royton said industry estimates suggested the chancellor may have overstated how many pubs would qualify for the support, which forms part of a \u00a3435m relief package designed to dampen criticism of the controversial changes to business rates. McMahon said said there were also serious questions over how pubs would afford to stay open when the support ends as scheduled in April 2018. \u201cPubs are at the heart of community life. So it\u2019s disappointing that all the chancellor can muster is a half-hearted response. For many in the pub industry this feels like a stay of execution. It does little to reassure the hard-working business owners that the Tories keep promising to help,\u201d said McMahon. \u201cI\u2019m calling on the government to issue clarity on this important issue.\u201d In his budget speech last Wednesday, Hammond said that 90% of all pubs had a rateable value of less than \u00a3100,000. But industry group the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) estimated a smaller proportion were likely to qualify for the discount, partly because of rules on how much state aid can go to any one pub company. EU rules restrict state aid to \u20ac200,000 (\u00a3174,000) per business over three years. The BBPA said that meant larger pub-owning companies with managed premises might not be able to receive the business rates discount, or would be eligible only for part of it. In other words, pubs that are part of chains such as JD Wetherspoon or Greene King risk getting no support at all. \u201cOur analysis suggests that between 3,000 and 4,000 pubs could miss out on the relief. This would mean that of rate-paying pubs, we would expect 72% to 75% to benefit from relief, as opposed to the 90% stated,\u201d said a spokesman for BBPA. The BBPA chief executive, Brigid Simmonds, said the one-year relief was still welcome but it did not go far enough. \u201cPubs pay 2.8% of the total rates bill, yet contribute only 0.5% of rate-paying businesses turnover. To really help pubs, the government should increase rate relief to \u00a35,000 per year, every year, until a full and fair review of business rates has taken place,\u201d she said. \u201cPub-specific business rates relief amounts to \u00a325m, but this is wiped out by a 3.9% increase in beer duty, which will cost pubs \u00a347m this year alone.\u201d The criticism of the government\u2019s plans follows claims last week by property consultancy Gerald Eve that a maximum of 61% of pubs would benefit. It found there were just under 40,000 properties in England described as public houses and 3,700 of these had a rateable value of more than \u00a3100,000, meaning they did not qualify for the discount. Of the remainder, about 12,000 pubs already got rates relief because they were classed as small businesses. A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cThe budget announced a \u00a31,000 business rates discount for the 90% of pubs in England which have a rateable value below \u00a3100,000. We were clear that this is subject to state aid limits, and even businesses with more than one pub could receive up to the full \u00a3174,000 limit in one year. In addition, pubs can also access the \u00a3300m of discretionary relief controlled by local authorities. \u201cThis is on top of \u00a39bn of rates cuts coming into effect in April for all businesses, including pubs, and \u00a33.6bn of transitional relief to support businesses as part of the revaluation.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Finally, George Mudie MP asks if the possibility of Scotland breaking away from the UK will be modelled in the next OBR forecasts Robert Chote replies that the OBR bases its work on UK government policy, so it all depends on the situation in November. And that\u2019s the end of the session, and this blog. See you tomorrow.. GW The Treasury Committee have also been considering the issue of Charlotte Hogg, the new deputy governor of the Bank of England who broke its code of conduct by not reporting that her brother works for Barclays bank. The Committee is due to issue a report on her appointment, and it doesn\u2019t look terribly good for Hogg. Here\u2019s the FT\u2019s latest: Q: What impact has the gig economy had on the UK labour market, and on weak wage growth? Chote says the OBR has made an assumption that self-employment numbers will grow faster than the rest of the labour market (previously it assumed they rose in parallel). And in the past, increases in self-employment has been \u201cmore disadvantageous\u201d than the OBR expected, because many of those jobs were low paid. Wes Streeting, another Labour MP, asks the OBR about its persistent habit of over-estimating wage growth. Q: What are you going to do about it? Robert Chote defends the watchdog\u2019s track record, pointing out that while wage growth has been weaker than forecast, employment growth has been stronger. So the OBR\u2019s broad assessment of the economy may be right, but the gains are going into new jobs, not higher pay. John Mann MP asks the OBR about Brexit Q: What is your projection for a reduction on EU nationals in the years after Brexit? Robert Chote says the OBR doesn\u2019t make its own forecasts, but it uses projections drawn up by the Office for National Statistics. Treasury committee chairman Andrew Tyrie asks about the data which the Treasury supplies to the OBR to help it draw up its forecasts. Q: Why can\u2019t the figures be released publicly? Is there any confidential data about individual taxpayers in there? The OBR say they don\u2019t see any individual taxpaper information, so that shouldn\u2019t be a problem. But there might be a risk of giving information about tax loopholes. Robert Chote looks wary of exposing the Treasury\u2019s numbers to public gaze -- if this happened, ministers might get \u201ca lot less candid\u201d about what they told the OBR. Really, asks Tyrie. We can\u2019t rule out doing anything just because someone might throw a tantrum, he insists. Back at parliament, Jacob Rees-Mogg MP asks the OBR about the UK tax take. This is heading towards the highest levels since Harold Wilson was prime minister at the end of the 1960s (at around 38% of national income, I think). Q: Is it as high as it can get? Robert Chote points out that many countries have a rather higher tax take, while others have much lower levels. Q: But aren\u2019t we close to the highest levels appropriate for the UK? Sir Charlie Bean replies that he suspects we are \u201csome way from the Laffer Curve tipping point\u201d (where a rise in tax rate brings in less money). However, \u201cwe may be at the political equilibrium\u201d, Bean adds, where politicians won\u2019t be willing to propose higher tax rates. Investors won\u2019t have to worry about article 50 being triggered tomorrow, it seems. Westminster correspondents are reporting that Theresa May won\u2019t fire the Brexit starting gun until the end of this month. Scotland\u2019s push for a new independence referendum may have forced the PM into a delay. Our political editor Heather Stewart reports: The government insists this isn\u2019t a u-turn, but Sam Coates of The Times says many won\u2019t agree: Back in parliament, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility is fielding questions on the budget. Q: Did the OBR come under any undue pressure when drawing up its economic and fiscal outlook, and its assessment of last week\u2019s budget? OBR chief Robert Chote says it did not come under pressure from ministers, and all its requests for information from government departments were met. In the past, we have received \u2018unsolicited submissions\u2019, Chote smiles - which didn\u2019t feel like pressure compared to some of the actual pressure he\u2019s felt at times. Q: Now we are moving to one fiscal event a year, rather than two, do we need two statements from the OBR each year? Sir Charlie Bean, who joined the OBR recently, says it is \u201cperfectly reasonable\u201d to think that the second set of economic forecasts should be dropped. That would also limit the temptation for ministers to put pressure on the watchdog. Q: The chancellor announced a new transitional relief fund to help companies facing higher business rates. How many firms will it actually help? Chote says the funds will be handled by local authorities, who don\u2019t have much instruction on how to use it. They could provide significant help to the worst cases, or spread the support across more companies. We just don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do yet. That transitional relief will also \u2018taper off\u2019 over the next few years, while business rates are set to rise steadily. The FTSE 100 index has also closed higher, up 0.3% at 7367. Mining stocks rallied, following a pick-up in commodity prices. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies has closed at a new record high. The FTSE 250 finished at 19,029 points, showing that Brexit angst isn\u2019t hitting the markets yet. The rally was driven by engineering firm Amex Foster, which closed 11% high after agreeing a takeover bid from John Wood. Housebuilder Bovis, which is being courted by Redrow and Galliford Try, jumped by 9,9%. Over at parliament, the Treasury committee are questioning the Office for Budget Responsibility over last week\u2019s Budget. Robert Chote, head of the independent watchdog is there, along with Sir Charlie Bean and Graham Parker. It\u2019s being streamed live here. I\u2019ll keep an eye out for any early fireworks... (we did hear a lot from the OBR last week). Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, predicts that sterling could get spooked if Scotland does press on with a second referendum (one of Fitch\u2019s five challenges today). He also believes the independence campaign will need to reassure voters about the economic case for breaking away from the UK, and some more detailed answers (ie, which currency they might use). Turner writes: \u201cWhile Brexit has, of course, added a new dimension, the economic concerns that led the majority in Scotland to vote to remain a part of the UK have not disappeared. Scottish GDP lags behind the UK and declining oil revenues have raised questions over the fiscal sustainability for an independent Scotland \u2013 especially if it intends to retain the pound. While EU membership may provide Scotland with a preferable trade agreement, carving a new membership would be no mean feat and the UK still remains Scotland\u2019s largest trading partner. \u201cMarket reaction to Sturgeon\u2019s speech has been muted so far, most likely because she still has a long way to go to achieve approval for a second Referendum and the announcement was well-flagged. Yet if approval becomes increasingly likely, we expect volatility in sterling to rise.\u201d The Scottish government\u2019s push for a fresh referendum on independence isn\u2019t hurting the pound. Sterling is holding onto this morning\u2019s gains, and changing hands at $1.223 against the US dollar, up 0.5% today. Kathleen Brooks of City Index believes traders believe Scotland would vote to remain in the UK (assuming this second referendum actually happens). She says; A second referendum for Scotland is not a key event risk for UK asset markets right now for a couple of reasons: firstly, Nicola Sturgeon didn\u2019t give an actual date for this referendum, it could happen sometime between 2018 and 2019, which is probably too far in the future for the markets to start worrying and pricing in the break up of the United Kingdom. Also, the latest opinion polls suggest that a second referendum would go the same way as the first, and the majority of voters would choose to stay in the United Kingdom. While opinion polls still can\u2019t be fully trusted, it\u2019s enough, at this stage, to keep UK markets calm. Another reason for calm is that the UK government (which must approve the plan) has tried to slap down the idea, saying another referendum would be divisive (!) and cause economic uncertainty (!!). Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has tweeted her opposition too. European Central Bank Mario Draghi has warned that productivity in the eurozone is being held back because too few firms are embracing new technology. Opening a conference on \u201cFostering Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the Euro area\u201d, Draghi argues that the future was brighter than coms fear. He says: If, as the world\u2019s second largest economic area, we were to dismantle barriers to innovative activity in the euro area, it would clearly give a boost to global innovation. Europe, though, has been slower than America when it comes to using new technologies such as computers, Draghi continues: This is a long-standing issue for the euro area: better adoption of ICT in the United States appears to explain most of the productivity gap between the US and the EU15 from 1995 to 2007. And small firms, Draghi concludes, need to catch up! There are many reasons why it is a priority today in the euro area to address weak productivity growth. But while some progress can be made in innovation, it is not in my view the sole issue. Equally important for the euro area is to facilitate and encourage the spread of new technology from the frontier to the laggard firms. Simply by diffusing better the technology we already have in the euro area, we could make sizeable gains in productivity. In other words, there is much we can still do to reverse the aggregate productivity slowdown and dispel pessimism about our future. Wall Street has just opened for the week, but there\u2019s not much excitement. The Dow Jones index and the S&amp;P 500 have both dipped by a mere 0.01%. Maybe traders are feeling lethargic after losing an hour\u2019s sleep on Sunday as America moved to Daylight Saving Time (Britain doesn\u2019t make the leap until 26 March). Is some UK economic data being leaked before publication, and are some unscrupulous investors profiting? New research published in the Wall Street Journal this morning suggests that some people in the markets may be making a killing by trading on official reports from the Office for National Statistics before they\u2019re published. The WSJ\u2019s Mike Bird writes: UK. government-bond futures often move sharply in the 24 hours before sensitive economic reports are released, an analysis of trading data shows, a phenomenon that suggests some investors may be trading with knowledge of official statistics before they are made public. On average, between April 2011 and December 2016, U.K. government-bond futures correctly anticipated the rise or fall that ultimately happened when economic data were published, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Alexander Kurov, associate professor of finance at West Virginia University. More here: Market Drift Suggests Some Investors May Be Trading on U.K. Economic Data Ahead of Release ONS reports are typically distributed among more than 100 people in government circles in the run-up to the official publication. And I can remember a few occasions over the years when gilts, or the pound, suddenly rose or fell just before 9.30am (when many ONS reports hit the wires). That\u2019s not proof of a leak, of course. But any hint of wrong-doing is a serious concern. Sam Bowman, Executive Director of the Adam Smith Institute, wants action: \u201cReports that markets are moving ahead of official ONS data releases in a way that is consistent with leaks and insider trading must be taken extremely seriously by the government and the ONS. \u201cIf flaws in ONS procedures are enabling market-moving leaks to take place, allowing some individuals to profit off secret information, then something has gone badly wrong. The Cabinet Office should review ONS procedures and consider substantial reforms in light of this new evidence. Bowman argues that Britain could learn from America: \u201cWe could follow the lead of the United States, where these suspicious market movements are seldom seen, and data is released less than 24 hours after completion and statistical reports are physically delivered to the President. \u201cAn alternative option would be to make the process entirely open, so that the public (and the markets) can see ONS data in real-time as it is generated, and markets can price in new information immediately and openly. The ONS is already working on this, but today\u2019s findings should be an urgent call to action for them to speed up the process.\u201d Up in Edinburgh, first minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that she\u2019ll ask the Scottish parliament to vote next on week on whether to hold a second independence vote. Sturgeon is arguing that Scotland shouldn\u2019t be taken down the path of \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 without being offered the alternative of an independent future inside the EU. It adds yet another dimension to the Brexit story...but the pound is curiously unmoved by this added political uncertainty. Rating agency Fitch has fired a sobering blast at anyone who thinks Britain\u2019s departure from the EU will be simple. In a new commentary, James McCormack, Fitch\u2019s Global Head of Sovereign Ratings, outlines five challenges facing Theresa May as she prepared to trigger article 50. McCormack points out that May doesn\u2019t have the luxury of controlling the agenda of the Brexit talks. This means some leaders can refuse to discuss future trade links, for example, until other contentious issues have been nailed down - such as Britain\u2019s outstanding financial promises to the bloc. As McCormack puts it: Lack of full control over the negotiating agenda is the most important of these. While Prime Minister May has said a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU is one of the government\u2019s objectives, some European leaders have suggested that post-exit trade arrangements can only be considered after the terms of exit have been agreed. A related challenge will be settling the financial terms of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, which is likely to be among the issues EU leaders seek to resolve up front. The UK will have a strong incentive to settle its \u201cexit bill\u201d quickly to preserve as much of the two-year negotiating period as possible for more difficult and important issues. But in so doing, it risks criticism at home of an early and unnecessary concession McCormack also spies three domestic challenges on the horizon, including the prospect of the United Kingdom breaking up. Scotland may seek a bespoke solution to allow continued access to the single market, raising the risk of a second independence referendum if its objectives are unmet. Scotland\u2019s First Minister is giving a speech on Brexit and Article 50 right now! Our Politics Liveblog is on the case: And that still leaves the possibility that some Brexit supporters get cold feet, if negotiations with the EU go badly. Beyond Scotland, there is certain to be plenty of open opposition to the government\u2019s negotiating strategies and priorities, exposing possible political pressure points that can be exploited by EU negotiators. Finally, it will prove challenging for the government to manage expectations over a two-year period, and negotiating setbacks may be reflected in heightened financial market volatility. The biggest associated risk is a decided swing in public opinion toward a more negative view of Brexit, lending support for either a greater Parliamentary role in approving the final negotiated agreement or another opportunity for the electorate to formally express its view. Plenty for investors to fret about, then. The FT\u2019s Gideon Rachman has written a good piece today about the uncertainty that shrouds Brexit - and worries the markets. He writes: Brexit is still shrouded by uncertainty. As one UK official closely involved in the process puts it: \u201cSome days I wake up and think it\u2019s all going to be fine. Other days, it feels like a disaster in the making.\u201d I feel the same way. It seems to me likely that Brexit will work out badly for Britain and fairly badly for the EU. But there are so many different variables involved that nobody sensible can be sure. There are three main \u201cknown unknowns\u201d. First, the negotiations themselves. Second, events in the wider world. Third, the unpredictable economic effects of what ever deal is struck. When it comes to the negotiations, both sides are talking tough. The EU is likely to demand a costly \u201cdivorce settlement\u201d of up to \u20ac60bn to settle Britain\u2019s unpaid bills and may refuse to discuss a trade deal until the UK has agreed to pay up. The early British response has been uncompromising. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has evoked the ghost of Margaret Thatcher. He and the Daily Mail will surely soon follow up with references to Winston Churchill. There is a high chance that the money issue will cause negotiations to break down before they really get going. However, it is also clearly possible that both sides are bluffing, and will back off. The more realistic voices in the UK government understand the dangers of a \u201ccliff edge\u201d Brexit in which the parties fail to agree a deal. And there are costs for the EU too. Britain is Germany\u2019s third-largest export market...... More here: Anyone caught up in today\u2019s rail strikes may be due compensation. So this chart from Money.co.uk could be useful: More info here: Southern Rail: Delay Repay compensation Northern Railways: Delay Repay Application Merseyrail: Refunds and Compensation Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk urges passengers to seek compensation: \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that travelling by train is becoming such a headache. The only consolation is you can claim a full refund if your train is cancelled and compensation if it\u2019s delayed. Most people don\u2019t know they can get money back from the train company if their travel plans are ruined by strike action. You can fill in a claims form online, it takes 5 minutes and gives you something to do if you\u2019re left standing at the station so it\u2019s definitely worth doing. Transport workers in Britain and Germany have downed tools this morning, leaving some passengers marooned and others struggling to get to work. In the UK, the Merseyrail and Northern rail networks have been hit by strike action that affects Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle. Unions are protesting against plans to introduce new trains with doors that can be operated by the driver, rather than guards. That\u2019s on top of (yet another) strike affecting Southern rail, as the ongoing row between unions and management continues. While in Germany, hundreds of flights have been cancelled as airport ground crews hold a 25-hour stoppage. They\u2019re calling for a pay increase and better working hours, to reflect an increase in their workloads. Anxiety over Wednesday\u2019s likely US interest rate rise is weighing on Europe\u2019s stock markets this morning. The UK, French and German trading floors are all rather subdued, meaning the main indices are little changed from Friday. With a rate hike priced in, investors will be happier when the Federal Reserve meeting is done and dusted. Chris Beauchamp of City firm IG says: Anyone wondering why the market is so quiet this morning will have to look no further than the Fed meeting for a reason. Another rate hike could be just days away, indeed, given the way the Fed\u2019s policymakers have been talking, it is practically a certainty at this point. Friday\u2019s jobs report reinforced the narrative, but the key now will be what the statement and press conference say. As a result we are likely to see the bullish flows that have dominated since the US election pause for breath, at least until Wednesday is out of the way. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets flags up that the drop in the dollar is pushing up commodity prices, and thus shares in miners. The oil price has hit a three-month low this morning. Brent crude slid to $51.26 per barrel, the weakest level since last November. And \u2018implied volatility ha surged, suggesting traders expect the price to move dramatically in the coming weeks. The selloff is being driven by signs that America\u2019s shale industry is boosting production. Figures released on Friday showed a rise in the number of oil rigs in action, and earlier data showed inventories are building. This could all undermine the deal hammered out by Opec members last autumn to cut supplies. Currency experts predict that the pound will face further pressure once Theresa May launches Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. Bloomberg has a good take. Here\u2019s a flavour: \u201cWe reject the notion that sterling has fully priced Article 50 and beyond. Risks to the currency remain to the downside on a disruptive start to negotiations,\u201d Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists including Kamal Sharma said in a note to clients on March 2, adding they see a dip before a recovery into the end of the year. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is also bearish. It recommended on March 3 selling the pound against the dollar at 1.2250, with a stop at 1.2530, as it sees the currency as the most over-valued in the Group-of-10 and investor confidence as vulnerable. Bank of America\u2019s preferred strategy is to bet on greater swings in the pound, rather than its direction. It has recommended buying three-month forward volatility, a measure of expected swings, with a target for it to gain around 20 percent from current levels. Societe Generale SA also sees opportunity in options, as it expects two-month implied volatility to pick up if cable falls below $1.20.... Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index has hit a fresh all-time high this morning, driven by merger activity. The FTSE 250, which is made up of medium-sized companies, hit 19,048 points in early trading. The rally is being led by engineering firm Amec Foster, which has surged by 19% after agreeing a takeover offer from larger rival John Wood (which is up 7.5%). Bovis\u2019s gains are also helping. The FTSE 250 has gained over 25% since the immediate aftermath of last June\u2019s EU referendum, defying speculation that the Brexit vote would cause financial trauma and a recession. In the City....shares in housebuilder Bovis Homes have surged by 8% in early trading, following takeover approaches from Redrow and Galliford Try. Although Bovis has rejected both offers, investors clearly suspect that a deal will be done - especially as Bovis is reeling from complaints of shoddy workmanship from hundreds of customers. Bovis shares are trading around 890p - and Neil Wilson of ETX Capital suggests a winning bid might be rather higher. Redrow\u2019s offer is valued at \u00a38.14 per Bovis share, while Galliford Try\u2019s is worth 886p per share. There is a strong chance that one will succeed and that should support the stock. But Bovis should hold out for a better premium. Joint brokers Deutsche Bank and Jeffries have price targets of 969p and 886p respectively. A successful bid might need to at least split the difference to satisfy the board. Although even that might not be enough \u2013 only in January Deutsche Bank was targeting 1066p for Bovis. Above \u00a310 a share might be more appropriate.\u201d Over in Westminster, the chatter is that Theresa May could trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on Tuesday. The prime minister is due to update MP on events at last week\u2019s EU council meeting tomorrow, and could take the opportunity to get the Brexit ball rolling. It\u2019s not quite as simple as that. First, MPs would have to remove amendments inserted into the Brexit legislation by the House of Lords last week, which give parliament the right to veto May\u2019s eventual deal. Parliament is also digesting a warning that Britain would find itself in a dire position if it doesn\u2019t agree a trade deal with Europe. Labour MP Pat McFadden has accused some government ministers of \u201cdangerous complacency\u201d, over their claims that Britain would be fine without a deal. My colleague Peter Walker explains: Open Britain, which groups a series of formerly pro-remain MPs from Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, said leaving with no deal would mean the UK \u201cchoosing the most extreme position of all major trading nations\u201d. The research, by the House of Commons library, found that the EU does not currently trade with any G20 member without some sort of preferential trade arrangement in place. While many of these fell short of full FTAs, some G20 countries, notably Australia and Japan, were now seeking more comprehensive deals, Open Britain said... More here: After strong US jobs data last Friday, there\u2019s a strong feeling in the markets that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates on Wednesday. That should encourage investors to hold the US dollar, as they can anticipate receiving a higher rate of return. But...the dollar\u2019s actually down this morning, shedding half a cent against the pound and the euro. So the pound is trading at $1.222, while the euro hit a one-month high of $1.0699. Why? FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed reckons it\u2019s a case of \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d. Investors are almost convinced that the Fed will move forward in tightening monetary policy, with speculators pricing in 89% chance of a rate hike according to CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool. Friday\u2019s robust non-farm payrolls report removed all doubts and now even skeptical investors believe that three rate hikes are the base scenario for 2017. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s going to be a busy week for the markets. The US Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates on Wednesday, accelerating the process of normalising monetary policy nearly a decade after the financial crisis began. Britain is poised to trigger Article 50 and begin the process of leaving the European Union. This could spark volatility in the foreign exchange world, with worries that the UK could crash out of the EU in 2019 without a trade deal. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say: In the UK, going into the week that should see that Brexit-article 50 bill going finally through parliament, the press is full with reports about the government preparing for a scenario where no trade deal is struck with the EU in 2 years\u2019 time. Government officials, including various ministers, stress, however, that they expect a deal to be signed in due time. There\u2019s plenty of geopolitics to worry about too. German chancellor Angela Merkel meets US president Donald Trump on Tuesday; will Trump raise concerns over the German trade surplus? Finance ministers from the G20 group of leading economies are due to meet on Friday and Saturday. Plus, European elections are dominating attention too, as investors fret about the chances of another populist revolt. The Dutch go to the polls this week, and there is talk that the Green party could do well. Far-right leader Geert Wilders appears to be losing support, though.... Plus, the Bank of England will set UK interest rates and consider adjusting its stimulus programme on Thursday. Also coming up today Today\u2019s agenda is a little light, but there\u2019s a couple of items to watch: 1.30pm: ECB president Mario Draghi gives opening address on \u201cFostering innovation and entrepreneurship in the euro area\u201d, at a conference in Frankfurt 4.15pm: Robert Chote, head of Britain\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility, testifies to the Treasury committee.

As one UK official closely involved in the process puts it: \u201cSome days I wake up and think it\u2019s all going to be fine. Other days, it feels like a disaster in the making.\u201d</p> <p>I feel the same way. It seems to me likely that Brexit will work out badly for Britain and fairly badly for the EU. But there are so many different variables involved that nobody sensible can be sure. There are three main \u201cknown unknowns\u201d. First, the negotiations themselves. Second, events in the wider world. Third, the unpredictable economic effects of what ever deal is struck.</p> <p> When it comes to the negotiations, both sides are talking tough. The EU is likely to demand a costly \u201cdivorce settlement\u201d of up to \u20ac60bn to settle Britain\u2019s unpaid bills and may refuse to discuss a trade deal until the UK has agreed to pay up.</p> <p>The early British response has been uncompromising. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has evoked the ghost of Margaret Thatcher. He and the Daily Mail will surely soon follow up with references to Winston Churchill. There is a high chance that the money issue will cause negotiations to break down before they really get going.</p> <p>However, it is also clearly possible that both sides are bluffing, and will back off. The more realistic voices in the UK government understand the dangers of a \u201ccliff edge\u201d Brexit in which the parties fail to agree a deal. And there are costs for the EU too.

    "webTitle": "Anglo American caps bonus payouts after shareholder revolt", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mining company Anglo American is attempting to head off a fresh row over executive pay by capping the size of bonus payouts in the face of sharp movements in its share price. More than 40% of its shareholders voted against its pay deals last year and the company is issuing its pay schemes this year at a time of renewed scrutiny over directors\u2019 bonuses following Theresa May\u2019s pledge to clamp down on corporate excess. The mining company\u2019s share price has formed a V-shape in the past two years, falling from \u00a311.60 in early 2015 to below 225p in January 2016 before rallying to more than \u00a311 again. These movements have an impact on executive pay as bonuses are linked to awards of shares relative to salary: when the share price is low the executive receives a higher number of shares and when the share price rallies the shares that are released from long-term schemes are worth more. For instance Mark Cutifani, the chief executive, is entitled to shares worth 350% of his \u00a31.3m salary that pay out after a three-year performance period. In 2015 he received 360,000 shares. Last year he received 993,000 shares \u2013 then valued at \u00a34.4m but now worth nearly \u00a312m. Sir Philip Hampton, the non-executive director who chairs the remuneration committee, said: \u201cWe were determined to address investors\u2019 concerns about the potential windfall gains for executive directors arising as a result of the volatility of the company\u2019s share price and the mining industry more generally.\u201d Cutifani will now be able to receive shares worth 300% of his \u00a31.3m salary compared with 350% and will have his gains from bonuses issued between 2014 and 2016 limited at \u00a313.1m. From this year onwards, gains will be limited to twice the face value of the shares when they were granted. His pay in 2016 was \u00a34m, up from \u00a33.4m, fuelled by a \u00a32.3m bonus. The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association said the proposed change did not go far enough. \u201cWhile Anglo American\u2019s direction of travel is to be welcomed, an annual bonus potentially worth 300% of a salary, on top of fixed pay approaching \u00a32m, still seems far too generous,\u201d Luke Hildyard, a policy lead at the PLSA, told Reuters. Another executive who received a rise in pay last year was Nicandro Durante, chief executive of British American Tobacco, who got \u00a37.6m in 2016 compared with \u00a34.5m a year earlier. Durante\u2019s pay was boosted by a \u00a32.9m payout from his long-term bonus plan, which had paid out \u00a3414,000 in 2015. Durante\u2019s salary is rising by 5% to \u00a31.25m from April to recognise his \u201coutstanding performance in 2016, in particular his individual leadership of the business in the year and his pivotal role in driving the group\u2019s growth agenda\u201d. UK employees are receiving rises between zero and 8%. Earlier this year BAT announced plans to buy the 58% it did not already own of Reynolds American. Its rival Imperial Brands was forced to abandon plans for a pay rise for its chief executive Alison Cooper from a potential \u00a35.5m to a potential \u00a38.5m to head off a shareholder revolt at its annual meeting earlier this year.",

In 2015 he received 360,000 shares.

      "bodyText": "SSE has become the last of the big six energy companies to raise its prices \u2013 and the news isn\u2019t good. Dual fuel prices will go up by 6.9% or \u00a373 a year for the dual fuel bills of 2.8 million standard tariff customers from the end of April. While it\u2019s not the worst out of the five suppliers who have declared a rise \u2013 that accolade goes to Npower \u2013 comparison sites have still condemned it as \u201chammer blow\u201d for householders. British Gas has frozen its prices, but only until August when it is expected to raise them, and experts say its standard tariff deal isn\u2019t good value anyway. \u201cThe picture is grim \u2013 everyone on a standard tariff from the big six, including British Gas, is being ripped off,\u201d says Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com. Given this parlous state of affairs, what can be done? Introduce a relative price cap John Penrose, a former minister at the Cabinet Office and a Conservative MP, has called on the government to introduce a relative price cap, where the worst-value standard variable tariffs are no more than a certain percentage more expensive than the best-value fixed deals. \u201cWe still get lots of competition, lots of choice, but it does mean the most vulnerable of us or those of us with least time to switch suppliers don\u2019t get ripped off,\u201d said Penrose. Penrose has secured a House of Commons debate on Thursday on energy bills. \u201cIn most things in life if you are a loyal customer you are valued and rewarded. But apparently for your energy bill, loyal customers in the view of big energy firms are there to be exploited and not rewarded \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t seem fair,\u201d he said. Impose a price cap After the Npower price rise, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, suggested he would cap price rises if he came to office, but Labour has yet to flesh out the details. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, used his budget to reiterate the government\u2019s promise to intervene if markets failed people. Industry figures have said that, despite the tough talk, there is little appetite among ministers for a cap in the green paper out in April. There are also fears it would kill off competition. \u201cTinkering with ideas like price caps as a magic bullet to bring down energy bills is a knee-jerk reaction that will leave consumers even more out of pocket in the long term,\u201d said Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at uSwitch.com. Investment bank Jefferies has calculated that capping standard tariffs \u00a350 below their current level would knock British Gas hard, denting profitability per customer from \u00a350 to \u00a335. A cap, but just for vulnerable customers Energy regulator Ofgem announced an energy price cap last month from 1 April for about 4m households on prepayment meters. Such coin- and token-operated meters are mostly used in rental properties and for customers who have fallen behind on their payments. Consumer group Citizens Advice is calling for that cap to be extended to people on the Warm Homes Discount, a scheme for those who find it difficult to pay their energy bills. Switch more This is the solution favoured by industry and, unsurprisingly, comparison sites. Moneysupermarket says the best value deals are \u00a3229 cheaper than the standard tariffs that many people are on. But even those cheaper, fixed deals are heading north: in March 2016 the site said the best fix was \u00a3751, which has jumped to \u00a3834 at present. But the main problem with switching, as an investigation by the competition watchdog concluded last year, is that not enough people do it. Although the number of people switching rose by 30% last year, around two-thirds of billpayers are still on the worst-value standard tariffs. Trials are under way this year on how best to encourage those \u201chard to reach\u201d people to switch. Energy efficiency The government abolished the green deal, its flagship scheme for bringing down household energy bills through insulation and more efficient boilers, shortly after coming to power in 2015. There are no signs that ministers have any plans to replace it this parliament. Energy efficiency advocates said the recent rises showed that switching was \u201clittle more than a short-term fix.\u201d Julie Hirigoyen, chief executive at the UK Green Building Council, which is urging ministers to establish a new national energy efficiency programme, said: \u201cImproving our draughty and poorly insulated housing stock should be an urgent national priority.\u201d More renewable energy - or less? SSE blamed its hike on the increasing cost of government policy, much of which involves subsidies for renewable energy projects such as windfarms. A recent Lords committee report blamed such support for recent price rises. However, green energy payments only accounted for 10% of the rise in bills between 2003 and 2016. Most of the increase was due to rising wholesale electricity and gas prices. Even the latest round of rises is primarily to do with fossil fuel prices, according to Ofgem. Figures published by the regulator last week show costs to energy suppliers have continued to increase since January, mainly due to wholesale prices going up. So there is also a school of thought that says extending the amount of electricity the UK gets from renewables \u2013 currently at 25% \u2013 would be the best way to protect billpayers from fluctuating wholesale prices. Ditch smart meters Under government plans, every home will have a smart meter by the end of 2020, doing away with the need for estimated bills. The cost of installing the meters was one of the reasons cited by ScottishPower for its 7.8% price hike. While no major figures or companies are currently calling for the end of 2020 deadline to be abolished or postponed, there is grumbling within the industry about the costs of the project \u2013 both for fitting them and maintaining the Capita-run body that will look after the data. Unions also complain that the companies are not training enough people or putting enough money into the upgraded programme.",

      "bodyText": "Developing countries are struggling with steep rises in their debt payments after being hit by a double whammy of lower commodity prices and a stronger dollar, with more pain to come once the US central bank raises interest rates this week, campaigners warn. The Jubilee Debt Campaign said that some of the world\u2019s poorest countries have seen the cost of repaying their debts \u2013 as a proportion of government revenue \u2013 hit the highest level for a decade. Government coffers have been depleted by lower revenues from commodity exports and the size of dollar-denominated debts has risen as the US currency has strengthened. The dollar has risen more than 6% against a basket of other big currencies over the past six months as investors anticipate that big spending plans by President Donald Trump will boost US growth and that the US Federal Reserve will follow up December\u2019s interest rate rise with more increases this year. After the latest US jobs numbers on Friday beat expectations, a rate rise from the Fed\u2019s policymakers when they meet this Wednesday is seen as imminent among investors. That would further increase the cost of debt payments for poor countries, which have taken out big loans in recent years from western countries where interest rates have been low, said the Jubilee Debt Campaign. Tim Jones, economist at the campaign group, warned the rising cost of debt payments was putting developing countries under extra strain just when they needed to be spending more money at home to meet the UN sustainable development targets \u2013 a series of goals for human development intended to be achieved by 2030. \u201cThe rapid increase in debt payments in many countries comes after a boom in lending, a fall in commodity prices, the rising value of the US dollar and now increasing dollar interest rates,\u201d said Jones. He warned there was a danger that loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other lenders would be used to bail out \u201creckless lenders\u201d who were at risk of not getting repayments from crisis-hit countries. That would lead to year of economic stagnation, just as in debt-laden Greece, Jones added. \u201cInstead, reckless lenders should be made to shoulder some of the costs of recent economic shocks by accepting lower payments,\u201d he said. Analysis by the Jubilee Debt Campaign showed that average government external debt payments across the 122 developing countries for which data is available have increased from 6.7% of government revenue in 2014 to 9.7% in 2016. That is the highest level since 2007. It used IMF and World Bank databases to calculate how a fall in commodity prices since mid-2014 had depleted government revenues and how the strengthening dollar had raised payments on external debts, which tend to be owed in dollars. The analysis found countries with the highest debt payments in 2016 included commodity producers such as Ghana, Mozambique, Angola, Laos and Chad as well as countries on the frontline of refugee flows from Syria, including Lebanon and Jordan.",

      "bodyText": "Households have spent \u00a3180m over the past three years on spare power capacity that was never used, according to a report that comes as MPs prepare to debate what can be done about rising energy bills. Power stations have been put on standby over the winter since 2014 as part of the National Grid\u2019s supplemental balancing reserve but the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) has found that the scheme, which closed in February, was never used. The thinktank said a new scheme to be introduced this winter would see the annual cost jump to \u00a3387m. Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the ECIU, said: \u201cThe clear message from this report is that paying to boost spare capacity in Britain\u2019s electricity system can be very expensive and potentially unnecessary.\u201d He calculated that increasing the capacity margin, the percentage difference between electricity supply and demand, would be extremely costly. The margin was 6.6% last winter, prompting a Lords committee last month to call for it to be boosted to 10%. But Marshall found that the cost of building enough capacity for a 10% margin would reach \u00a312.4bn with nuclear power, and even cheaper gas power plants would hit \u00a31.7bn to 2.1bn. The ECIU said that reserves could be more affordably secured through energy storage, greater interconnectivity with Europe and smart technology to help reduce demand from big energy users at crunch times. The National Grid defended the reserve scheme as a cost-effective insurance policy, and added that the winters had been mild. \u201cWe believe the supplemental balancing reserve was a prudent and efficient use of money to ensure we had extra power available to us in all eventualities,\u201d a spokeswoman said. The Met Office said the last three winters had seen above average temperatures. But Marshall said the standby scheme was about coping during dark, windless cold snaps, so temperatures across the season were not key. Over the weekend, the National Grid and Google\u2019s Deepmind confirmed they were in early talks about how artificial intelligence could be deployed to more efficiently manage power supply and demand. Last year Deepmind said it had cut total energy use at its data centres by 15% by using machine learning. The row over how much spare capacity the UK should have to pay for comes ahead of a House of Commons debate about energy bills on Thursday. Four of the big six energy suppliers have announced price rises over the winter including E.ON, which last week announced it was hiking dual fuel prices for 2.5 million customers by 8.8%.",

      "bodyText": "Rents in Britain have recorded their first annual drop for six years, according to the UK\u2019s biggest estate and lettings agency. In February, the average rent in Britain was \u00a3921 a month, \u00a35 lower than a year earlier, and the first annual decrease since 2011. Countrywide, which compiled the figures, said the buying frenzy ahead of the hike in stamp duty last year pushed up the supply of new homes for letting by 10%. Meanwhile tenant demand has been dropping, particularly in London, possibly related to Brexit. Rents are falling fastest in the capital, down 4.3% over the year to an average of \u00a31,246 a month. It means tenants are now typically paying \u00a363 a month less to secure an apartment compared to last year. Rents in the south-east have also dropped, by an average of 2.6%, but in other parts of the UK they are still rising. Countrywide said rents in Wales were up 5.3% over the last 12 months to an average of \u00a3636 per month, while in the east of England they rose 3.1% to \u00a3945. In London, the supply of new homes to let is up 18%, but the number of tenants looking for properties has fallen by 3%. Tenant demand is also falling in the south-east, but in other parts of the UK it continues to rise. Johnny Morris, research director at Countrywide, said: \u201cEconomic and housing sentiment \u2013 both in sales and rental markets \u2013 has been affected by our vote to leave the EU, in London more than anywhere else. This uncertainty causes tenants to be more cautious, meaning less likely to move and more likely to look for cheaper accommodation, eg sharing. With the private rented sector home to around three-quarters of new migrants, any future substantial shift in migration patterns would likely have a knock-on effect on rents.\u201d Any falls in rents will come as welcome relief to tenants after years of rises. Despite the small decrease over the past 12 months, the average rent in Britain is still \u00a3112 higher than the previous peak in 2007, even though average incomes have only edged ahead since the financial crisis. The government\u2019s white paper on housing last month acknowledged that England\u2019s housing market is \u201cbroken\u201d, with the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, telling the House of Commons that rents in many places swallow more than half of take-home pay. Separate figures from LSL Property Services, which includes estate agents Your Move and Reeds Rain, paint a similar picture of a slow market in the south and much busier activity in the Midlands and north. It said annual house price growth dropped to 2.4% in February from 3.9% the month before, the 12th month in a row that the annual rate of inflation has fallen. It said London had been the most challenging market. \u201cEvery borough [of London] has seen a reduction in transactions for the three months to the end of January, compared to a year before, and London has seen the largest drop in transactions in the country, down 22%,\u201d LSL said. Prices in once-booming markets such as Camden, Hackney, Fulham and Richmond have all fallen over the past year said LSL, although they are currently falling fastest in Tower Hamlets, home to Canary Wharf\u2019s skyscrapers and residential tower developments. In contrast, it said house prices in Birmingham and Merseyside had hit a new peak. Average prices in Birmingham have hit \u00a3190,504, up 6.2% on the year. However the location with the biggest percentage price rise over the past 12 months is Merthyr Tydfil, normally a byword for property depression. Homes in the former mining town have jumped in price by 12.7% over the past year but, at an average of \u00a3120,682, are still among the cheapest in the UK. LSL added that a low volume of transactions in the area makes price reports highly volatile. Nationally, turnover in the property market has been falling, with the number of transactions down 9% on the year. Flats had the biggest reduction in sales volumes, falling 15%.",
