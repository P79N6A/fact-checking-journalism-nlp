      "bodyText": "The founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos briefly overtook Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates to become the world\u2019s richest person. Bezos leapfrogged Gates, who has been the richest man on the planet since 2013, after a rise in the share price of Amazon ahead of its latest results due Thursday night. According to a real-time billionaires index compiled by Forbes, the rise pushed the value of Bezos\u2019s fortune to $91bn (\u00a369bn) \u2013 compared with Gates\u2019 wealth of $90bn. Their riches are calculated on the share prices of their respective companies and at the current values Bezos\u2019s stake is twice as big as carmaker Ford. But the Amazon share price fell back leaving Gates on top, but with less than $1bn separating them. Bezos \u2013 born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1964 \u2013 keeps a relatively low profile, but has used some of the wealth he has amassed to buy the Washington Post and invest in space travel through Blue Origin, a company he founded in 2000. He began Amazon in 1994 when he sold books from his garage in Seattle before expanding into a huge range of other products and capturing the global rush to online shopping. Amazon now accounts for 43% of everything sold online in the US and 64 million people have signed up for its Prime service \u2013 which gives access to free deliveries and video streaming. Amazon shares have soared this year \u2013 making the company worth more than $500bn. At the start of 2017, Bezos was ranked fourth-richest in the world, behind Gates, the investor Warren Buffett and Amancio Ortega, who founded Inditex, the company behind retailer Zara. The share price rally comes despite accusations by Donald Trump, during the US election campaign, that Amazon was \u201cgetting away with murder, tax-wise\u201d. He said Bezos was using the Washington Post for \u201cpolitical influence\u201d. In January, Bezos pledged the full legal resources of his company to fight the travel ban instituted by the new US president against seven Muslim-majority nations. Amazon floated on the stock market in 1997. Every year Bezos reprints the letter he sent to shareholders that year, insisting it is only Day 1 for the company and pledging to focus on the long-term and be the market leader. He has not joined the club of billionaires who pledge to hand over the majority of fortunes to charity \u2013 started by Gates and his wife, along with Buffett \u2013 but recently tweeted to ask for philanthropic ideas to help in the short term, which he said was in contrast to his long-term approach to running the business. \u201cI want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now \u2013 short term \u2013 at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact.\u201d Forbes started tracking billionaires in 1987 and Bezos is the seventh person to hold the title of the world\u2019s richest person. In a report on his rise to the top of the rankings, Forbes said Bezos would not be at the top if Gates had not given so much of his wealth away and has calculated that Gates has been the richest person in the world for more than half the 30 years it had been watching the wealth of billionaires. The closing share price of Amazon and Microsoft on Thursday will determine whether Bezos cements his position at the top of the league. Microsoft\u2019s shares were down on Thursday. Technology stocks have been outpacing the rest of the US stock market, but wobbled last month amid concerns that the sector might run of steam. Amazon and others then started to rally again. It remains to be seen whether Bezos is able to permanently claim the top slot. Amazon has now expanded beyond retailing. It now sells cloud computing services to thousands of businesses ranging from Netflix to the UK\u2019s ministry of justice. It also makes TV shows and the Echo smart speaker, which allows users to speak to Alexa, an electronic personal assistant.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The potential end of an era looms in British aviation after Sir Richard Branson announced he is selling 31% of Virgin Atlantic, relinquishing his controlling interest in the airline he founded in 1984. Branson will net \u00a3220m from the deal to sell the 31% stake to Air France-KLM and remain as chairman of the airline. He retains a 20% interest, leaving the US giant Delta as the largest shareholder in Virgin Atlantic with 49%. Virgin Atlantic is expected to retain its independence as a UK airline and will continue to fly under the Virgin brand. The deal forms part of an extensive tie-up on lucrative transatlantic routes announced by Virgin, Delta and Air France-KLM on Thursday. The three airlines, along with ailing Italian carrier Alitalia, will join together in a single joint venture on flights between Europe and the US, co-operating on schedules and frequent flyer schemes \u2013 an alliance that will step up competition with the partnership between American Airlines and Branson\u2019s great rival, British Airways. Branson said it was \u201ca fantastic opportunity to extend our network and create a stronger customer champion, as well as being extremely beneficial to our people and the Virgin Atlantic brand\u201d. The 67-year-old entrepreneur, probably the most famous face in the modern aviation industry, started out by chartering and selling seats on his first plane when a flight was cancelled in the Caribbean. He later positioned his Virgin Atlantic airline as an exciting, glamorous upstart trying to break the grip of a stuffy BA on UK aviation. That rivalry intensified in the \u201cdirty tricks\u201d battle in the 1980s, which saw Branson win a large libel settlement from BA. He later presented the airline\u2019s first tie-up with Delta, announced in 2012, as a response to the national carrier\u2019s dominance from Heathrow to the US. Delta bought a 49% stake in Virgin in 2013 \u2013 a move that BA\u2019s chief executive, Willie Walsh, predicted would end in Branson ceding control within five years. Virgin Atlantic edged into profit from 2014 to 2016, but had forecast losses this year on the back of the Brexit referendum and the fall in sterling. In a letter to staff on Thursday, Branson said it was an exciting day for the airline, and said he would still remain as the largest individual shareholder, adding that his new partners all agreed the brand should survive. But he noted that the airline had been operating for half his lifetime, and added: \u201cAs I get a little older, I want to be certain that all the necessary building blocks are in place for Virgin Atlantic to continue to prosper and grow for the next 50 years. \u201cThe airline industry has consolidated over Virgin Atlantic\u2019s lifetime and it\u2019s now our turn to put ourselves at the heart of an important alliance ... With these three partners in place and with me \u2013 and one day, the wider Branson family \u2013 still very much involved, we have the foundations to make sure this is so.\u201d Atlanta-based Delta already had a joint venture with Air France-KLM dating back to 2009, including Alitalia from 2010. Delta also announced on Thursday it would buy a 10% stake in Air France-KLM for \u20ac375m (\u00a3335m), as will China Eastern, with both joining the European airline conglomerate\u2019s board, subject to regulatory approval.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The controversial Walkie Talkie tower in the City of London has commanded a record-breaking price for a single building in the UK \u2013 \u00a31.3bn in a sale to a Hong Kong manufacturer of oyster sauce. The Lee Kum Kee condiment company is a fitting arrival to the Square Mile\u2019s sky-high dinner party, where the Gherkin and Cheesegrater await the arrival of the squat Can of Ham. The Hong Kong family sauce business, established in 1888, appears to have a growing appetite for high profile London towers: it acquired a docklands office building for \u00a337m in 2016 and approached owners of the Gherkin earlier this year, even though it wasn\u2019t for sale. Neither was the Walkie Talkie, but that didn\u2019t prove to be an obstacle. \u201cWe weren\u2019t in a position where we wanted to sell assets,\u201d said Rob Noel, chief executive of Landsec, the co-developer of the building with Canary Wharf Group. \u201cBut no asset is sacrosanct and this is a price at which we have to sell it. We started it in 2010 and people asked \u2018what on earth are you doing\u2019 \u2013 now it\u2019s sold at a record pricing.\u201d That incredulity seemed apt, given that the 37-storey tower at 20 Fenchurch Street was plonked on the skyline outside the designated \u201ccluster\u201d of tall buildings, on a site surrounded by conservation areas. It was given permission by the City\u2019s then chief planner, Peter Rees, on the basis that it would provide a Babylonian \u201csky garden\u201d at its summit, a new public piazza for the Square Mile from where people could admire the motley collection of buildings behind them . Unfortunately, the resulting rooftop lounge has all the charm of Stansted airport, and it comes with a similar level of security and pre-booking to gain entry. Designed by New York-based Uruguayan architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, the Walkie Talkie made headlines in 2013 before it had even opened, when its concave glass facade was found to channel the sun into a scorching beam of heat on to the street below. Repeating exactly the same mistake he made with his similarly concave Vdara hotel in Las Vegas, Vi\u00f1oly\u2019s \u201cdeath ray\u201d succeeded in melting the bumper of a Jaguar, blistering painted shopfronts and singeing carpets, with temperatures proving hot enough to fry an egg on the pavement. Nor was it much safer when the sun went in: the tower\u2019s glacial cliff-face was accused of channelling winds so strong that pedestrians were in danger of being blown into the road. Standing as the comedy villain of the City, like a broad-shouldered banker bursting out of a cheap pin-striped suit, it is only fitting that the Walkie Talkie should reap the biggest bounty in history \u2013 representing a profit of 167% on the development cost. It was designed as a ruthless diagram of market values, swelling out to provide the largest floorplates at the more expensive upper floors, and it has been slammed as a planning mistake of such magnitude that it\u2019s unlikely to be crowded out by other towers, its thuggish silhouette forever destined to stand alone as a reminder of the forces that rule the capital.",

The Hong Kong family sauce business, established in 1888, appears to have a growing appetite for high profile London towers: it acquired a <a href=\"http://www.costar.co.uk/en/assets/news/2016/December/Chinese-soy-sauce-giant-buys-Clearbell-Docklands-offices/\">docklands office building for \u00a337m in 2016</a> and approached owners of the Gherkin earlier this year, even though it wasn\u2019t for sale.

      "bodyText": "It damaged cars with scorching reflected sunlight, has been accused of creating a wind tunnel that can topple pedestrians and has split the capital into lovers and haters. Now, London\u2019s landmark Walkie Talkie building has broken records with its \u00a31.3bn sale to a Hong Kong firm best known for making oyster sauce. The controversial skyscraper, officially called 20 Fenchurch Street, is being bought by the property arm of Lee Kum Kee Health Products Group, a conglomerate that makes condiments and healthcare products and also develops property. The price tag is the highest ever paid for a single UK building. The deal easily surpasses the previous record price for a single building in the UK. The Qatar Investment Authority paid \u00a31.17bn to acquire the HSBC tower in Canary Wharf in December 2014. Property company Land Securities, whose other investments range from Brighton Marina to the Lakeside shopping park in Thurrock, Essex, said it had exchanged contracts to sell its 50% stake in the City of London building. Lee Kum Kee is buying the other 50% from Canary Wharf Group. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of August. The 37-storey Walkie Talkie, nicknamed for its distinctive top-heavy shape, has been dividing opinion since before its completion in 2014. In 2013, the building\u2019s south-facing glass facade channelled the sun\u2019s rays into a beam of heat, which melted the bumper of a Jaguar, blistered painted shopfronts and singed carpets. The heat was so intense that a journalist on a City newspaper managed to fry an egg on the pavement. The incidents earned the building new nicknames, including the Walkie Scorchie and Fryscraper, and the builders were forced to apply sun shading to resolve the issue. The architect, Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, said he had predicted the building might reflect the sun\u2019s rays on to the street below, but \u201cdidn\u2019t realise it was going to be so hot\u201d. He admitted that \u201ca lot of mistakes\u201d had been made with the Walkie Talkie that needed to be put right. On the top of the building is the three-storey Sky Garden visitor attraction, offering bars and restaurants, and the larger floors at the top of the structure make the most of views over London. But its bulbous shape, which looms over nearby buildings, is not universally appreciated. In 2015 it won the Carbuncle Cup, an annual award for the ugliest building of the year presented by architecture magazine Building Design. One judge called it \u201ca gratuitous glass gargoyle graffitied on to the skyline of London\u201d, while another described it as a \u201cBond villain tower\u201d. The Walkie Talkie is the latest trophy London building to be bought by investors from China, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong, who, despite Brexit, are taking advantage of the low value of the pound to snap up property bargains in the capital. Chinese investors have spent \u00a33.5bn on property in the City and the West End so far this year. The nearby \u201cCheesegrater\u201d tower, officially called the Leadenhall Building, was sold to China\u2019s CC Land for \u00a31.15bn in March, while Beijing Capital Development Holdings, a state-owned group, bought a 15-storey block on the edge of the City for \u00a3210m late last year. Lee Kum Kee purchased the glass-fronted 3 Harbour Exchange building in Docklands in December for \u00a337m, and earlier this year the group tried and failed to buy the Gherkin. LKK is a 129-year-old family business that specialises in oyster sauce, shrimp paste and Chinese herbal medicine, and is controlled by 88-year-old billionaire Lee Man Tat. James Beckham, head of London capital markets at property advisory firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said: \u201cThis record-breaking deal demonstrates the enormous investor appetite in London, and in the City\u2019s reputation as the global place to do business. \u201cSince the vote to leave the EU, capital targeting London from the Asia-Pacific region has increased to record levels. This is partly due to currency fluctuations, but is more indicative of longer-term confidence in London and investment strategies which are not derailed by short-term political uncertainty.\u201d Beckham described London as the \u201cnumber one destination\u201d for Asian investors who want to invest abroad. The Walkie Talkie is thought have been a commercial success for its developers. The 17,000 sq ft ground floor (about the same size as a small supermarket) is occupied by retail outlets, while the office space above, which is especially popular with insurance firms, is fully let. Robert Noel, chief executive of Land Securities, said the property company had achieved \u201can exceptional price\u201d for the building, which had been \u201can immensely successful project\u201d. Sammy Lee, chairman of LKK Health Products Group, which includes the Infinitus Property Investment division, said: \u201cWe are delighted to acquire 20 Fenchurch Street in central London to expand our global presence through strategic investments.\u201d The group also owns and manages office and retail space in Guangzhou and Shanghai in China, as well as in central Hong Kong.

    "webTitle": "BBC women let pay gap happen, review co-chair says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The co-chair of a government-commissioned review into increasing the number of women in senior business roles has been accused of being \u201cpeculiarly out of touch\u201d after he said female BBC staff allowed the gender pay gap at the corporation to materialise. Sir Philip Hampton, a City grandee working to remove barriers preventing women from rising to senior business posts, came under fire after he told the Evening Standard he had \u201cnever, ever had a woman ask for a pay rise\u201d. On the gender pay row that has engulfed the BBC since it published a list of its top earners last week, Hampton said: \u201cHow has this situation arisen at the BBC that these intelligent, high-powered, sometimes formidable women have sat in this situation? \u201cThey [female broadcasters] are all looking at each other now saying: \u2018How did we let this happen?\u2019 I suspect they let it happen because they weren\u2019t doing much about it.\u201d Hampton went on to urge the BBC to tackle the pay gap, saying most people would see it as \u201cunjustified differentials\u201d. \u201cThis BBC data has been so powerful because these are people who sit together in a radio studio and do what most listeners think is exactly the same job, and yet the bias is very clear towards men,\u201d he said. But he faced a backlash on Thursday for his comments about employees not asking for pay rises. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of women reporting to me or coming in to talk to me about their careers \u2013 either for general guidance or employees of companies where I\u2019ve been working,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a list long enough for all men who\u2019ve asked. Lots of men have trooped into my office saying they are underpaid, but no woman has ever done that.\u201d Hampton is co-chair with Dame Helen Alexander of the Hampton-Alexander review into increasing the number of women at executive level in FTSE 350 companies. He is the non-executive chairman of drugs company GlaxoSmithKline and previously chaired the Royal Bank of Scotland and J Sainsbury. He said he believed many chief executives would echo his comments. \u201cIt is far more common for men to ask for more money than it is for women,\u201d he said. But the BBC Woman\u2019s Hour presenter Jane Garvey told the Standard: \u201cThe likes of Sir Philip Hampton can never begin to understand. He seems peculiarly out of touch given the task he has. Many women have learnt to question their position in the workplace, partly because of the dominance and success of people like him.\u201d Women\u2019s hesitance to ask for a pay rise and a lack of assertiveness is one of the most common explanations cited for the persistence of the gender wage gap. But last year, a study found that men and women ask for pay increases at the same rate, seemingly debunking this claim. Using data from 4,600 Australian workers across more than 800 employers, the study from the University of Wisconsin in the US and the University of Warwick and Cass Business School in the UK found \u201cno difference\u201d in the likelihood of asking. The study found that when like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked. Labour MP Stella Creasy tweeted that women do ask for pay rises but men are more likely to get them, citing the study. Dame Helena Morrissey, founder of the 30% Club, which campaigns for female representation on company boards, commended Hampton\u2019s work in gender equality. \u201cFrom all my dealings with him over many years, I do think he\u2019s a good guy and very committed to progress on gender equality and has been for a long time, so [this] sounds like a misunderstanding,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate \u2013 clearly it\u2019s not BBC women\u2019s fault that they have been less well paid. \u201cI am surprised if Sir Philip meant to imply it was women\u2019s own fault, but the quotes look like that\u2019s what he said. Sometimes I think the men are exasperated that we don\u2019t ask for more, but that misses the point. We shouldn\u2019t have to play by the men\u2019s game to succeed.\u201d Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury committee, who appointed Hampton to carry out the review, told the Standard: \u201cSurely we have moved beyond it being about who marches into the boss\u2019s office asking for a pay rise. \u201cThat\u2019s why the gender pay gap disclosures put the burden on senior management to think about pay differentials in their organisation. \u201cPresumably the [BBC] presenters relied on the fact that the BBC was a world-renowned organisation and would treat people equally. Clearly that has proven to be a mistake.\u201d The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Jo Swinson, said in a statement that Hampton\u2019s comments \u201cheap insult on injustice\u201d and at best were \u201castonishingly ill-judged\u201d. His remarks that women allowed the pay gap to happen, she added, displayed a \u201cworrying lack of understanding of the structural, race and class bias across all of society at all levels, including the BBC. \u201cBlaming women for the gender gap in organisations gets us nowhere. We need to recognise the endemic problem of sexism and all take proactive steps to solve it.\u201d Responding to the criticism, Hampton said: \u201cI\u2019m not blaming women \u2013 not remotely. It\u2019s just acknowledging the differences [in behaviour between men and women].\u201d In a statement the Hampton Alexander review said: \u201cThere was an unfortunate comment in reference to the BBC gender pay debate. In no way does Sir Philip think that it was the responsibility of women at the BBC or in any organisation to have done more.\u201d The government declined to criticise Hampton when asked whether he should keep his advisory role, and it is understood he will still be asked to deliver his report on women in business later this year. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThere are many factors that contribute to the gender pay gap, but we know transparency is important in tackling it. This is why we\u2019ve changed the law to require all large employers to publish their gender pay gap figures. They have until next April to publish the information and we are pleased to see some organisations stepping up and doing this well ahead of the deadline.\u201d The BBC\u2019s pay list showed that only one-third of its top earners were women and the top seven were all men, with male co-presenters frequently earning more than their female colleagues. Earlier this week, Rachel Burden, the co-presenter of BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast, said female journalists were \u201cignored or belittled\u201d when they asked senior managers whether they were paid the same as comparable male colleagues. More than 40 of the BBC\u2019s most high-profile women, including Burden, as well as Claire Balding, Newsnight presenters Emily Maitlis and Kirsty Wark and One Show host Alex Jones, wrote to Tony Hall, the director general, calling on him to urgently correct the gender pay gap. In response, Hall said he hoped the BBC could close its gender pay gap sooner than 2020. Hampton also said it was \u201chealthy\u201d that the BBC now talked more openly about salaries and accused male-dominated companies of \u201cliving in the past\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "With this, we are closing the blog for today. Good-bye and thank you for all your great comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Wall Street has got off to flying start: US stocks have risen to fresh record highs boosted by a flurry of strong company results. The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 70 points, or 0.4%, to 21778.96 while the S&amp;P 500 advanced nearly 4 points, or 0.15%, to 2481.73. and the Nasdaq climbed 33 points, or 0.5%, to 6455.67. Here in London, the FTSE 100 index is still in negative territory, down nearly 13 points at 7439.65, a 0.2% drop. Investors are breathing a sigh of relief after US durable goods data showed a better than expected 6.5% gain in orders in June, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at online broker UFX.com. A downbeat assessment on current inflation levels at yesterday\u2019s Fed Reserve meeting had cast further uncertainty over the next interest rate, although today\u2019s numbers suggest the US economy remains in good health.\u201d The greenback could claw back some of yesterday\u2019s losses against major European counterparts. Attention now turns to tomorrow\u2019s all-important GDP data. The US economy must continue to meet expectations if Janet Yellen is to confirm an interest rate hike in September. Phillip Hammond has found a new Bank of England deputy governor to replace the disgraced Charlotte Hogg from within his own Treasury ranks. The chancellor has appointed the Treasury\u2019s chief economic adviser, Sir David Ramsden to replace Hogg, who resigned earlier this year after failing to disclose that her brother was a senior executive at Barclays \u2013 a bank she would have regulated. Ramsden\u2019s full title will be deputy governor of markets and banking. Hogg was also chief operating officer, but that post is going to someone else. The Bank of England will make a separate announcement about that post later today. Ramsden has a long list of responsibilities in his new role, the Treasury said, including : specific responsibility for managing the balance sheet, the government\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, and the gathering of market intelligence relevant to policy decisions. Sir Dave, as he is known, will also be a member of the monetary policy committee, the financial policy committee, the prudential regulation committee and the court of the Bank of England. The world\u2019s oil consumption could peak as early as the late 2020s as electric cars become more popular, says Royal Dutch Shell boss Ben van Beurden. But he added that oil would still be needed for several more decades, arguing that it will remain the main fuel used in planes, ships and heavy trucks. He told reporters after Shell, Europe\u2019s biggest oil company reported a sharp rise in quarterly profits: Even if the UK, France and the western world in general will all go to 100% electric vehicles, that would be great, but that wouldn\u2019t be enough... We still have less advanced economies that cannot do that switch. He even admitted that he would get an electric car the next time he buys a new vehicle, in an interview with Bloomberg. The International Energy Agency, the energy watchdog, does not expect oil demand to peak before 2040. Shell, which has been producing oil since 1907, and its rivals are increasingly switching to less-polluting natural gas. France has decided to nationalise the STX France shipyard, marking president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s first major industrial policy decision, Reuters is reporting, citing Le Monde. The French government has been in an ownership standoff with Italy over the shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, north-western France. Reuters says: As France\u2019s most pro-business leader in decades, few would have predicted the former investment banker\u2019s first big move in the corporate sector to be a nationalisation. However, his action fits with the interventionist style of other postwar French leaders. It also crosses into the strategically sensitive defence sector where many national governments prefer to wield influence over ownership. The Economy Ministry would not comment on the report when asked by Reuters, but said it would hold a news conference on the subject at 3:00 pm (1300 GMT). Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire had given the Italians until Thursday to accept an offer for 50/50 ownership of the shipyard, brandishing the threat of a temporary nationalisation to buy time to find another solution if the offer were rebuffed. \u201cThe aim is not to nationalise Saint-Nazaire, but we have to temporarily.\u201d The warm summer weather added a sizzle to Britain\u2019s high streets this month: retail sales growth hit a three-month high as shoppers updated their summer wardrobes and bought more groceries, according to a monthly survey from the CBI employers\u2019 group. Its retail sales balance rose to 22 in July from 12 in June, marking the highest reading since April. Expectations for next month were the strongest since last December, but the CBI warned it might not last. Anna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the CBI, said: While retailers expect a similar pace of growth next month, the factors underpinning their sales growth are more shaky. Although employment is strong, real incomes are falling in the wake of higher inflation, and that\u2019s expected to feed slower consumer spending growth ahead.\u201d Time for a quick market round-up. The FTSE 100 index has slipped into negative territory, trading down some 2 points at 7450.24. AstraZeneca\u2019s woes are weighing on the index, as is the stronger pound, which is rising against the dollar after a more cautious statement from the US Federal Reserve last night suggested the next interest rate hike may be some way off, and sent the greenback sliding. Sterling has risen as high as $1.3157, its highest level since mid-September \u2013 good news for holidaymakers heading to the US. It has eased back to $1.3141, but is still about 1% higher than before the Fed statement. However, the euro has also rallied against the dollar and sterling is still close to eight-week lows on expectations that the European Central Bank will tighten policy later this year. It is trading at 89.21 pence per euro. AstraZeneca is the biggest faller with a 16.1% loss to \u00a342.87 after news of a key lung cancer drug trial failure, and the stock is on track for its worst day ever. Lloyds Banking Group is also among the biggest losers after reporting another \u00a31bn charge for PPI claims. Its shares are down 2.3% at 67.49p. Drinks giant Diageo is the biggest riser, with the shares up 6.5% at \u00a324.20. The maker of Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff raised its profitability target and unveiled a share buyback programme. Sky has also reported results this morning. Our media correspondent Mark Sweney reports: Sky is to hire 300 new technology staff to keep pace with rivals such as Netflix and Amazon as the broadcaster suffered a drop in full year profits and an increase in the rate of customers defecting to rivals. Here is our full story on Lloyds. AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot is fielding numerous questions about whether he\u2019s leaving to join Israel\u2019s Teva. With a sigh, he said The head of Britain\u2019s financial markets watchdog just said that the UK will scrap the scandal-hit Libor interest rate benchmark from the end of 2021, when a substitute index should be in place. Libor is based on banks\u2019 submissions of interest rates they believe they would be charged for borrowing money. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said in a speech in London that work must \u201cbegin in earnest\u201d on shifting to an alternative index, saying that aiming for the end of 2021 would ensure a smooth transition. AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot is speaking on a conference call to journalists after the failure of a key lung cancer drug trial sent the company\u2019s shares down more than 15%, to \u00a343.24. The stock is heading for its worst day ever. Soriot, whilst saying that the company never comments on market speculation and rumours, has tried to squash the speculation triggered by a recent media report that he could jump ship and defect to Israel\u2019s Teva, the world\u2019s biggest generics drugmaker. He said: I\u2019m impressed with the progress we\u2019ve made. I\u2019m proud to be the CEO of this company and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing on our journey ahead... I\u2019m committed to delivering our strategy of returning to growth. Travel company Thomas Cook as announced that it will start selling holidays in Tunisia again soon, after the UK changed its travel advice yesterday. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser told journalists: The foreign office came to the conclusion that it is again safe to travel. We didn\u2019t have any programme for the winter so we are setting up a really good quality offer for Tunisia and this is going to take some time. I suppose that we are gong to start during the winter season, but more towards the spring. The Walkie Talkie skyscraper in the City has been sold to a Hong Kong oyster sauce maker for \u00a31.28bn in a record-breaking deal. Land Securities has sold the building at 20 Fenchurch Street to Hong Kong-based Lee Kum Kee, a sauces company that specialises in oyster-flavoured sauce. It is the latest trophy building in London to be acquired by Asian investors, and marks the biggest sale ever of an office building in the UK. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Foxtons, the London-based estate agent known for its fleet of Minis, has seen its shares tumble 7% to 89.75p, after a 64% plunge in first-half profits, as the London market cooled. Pretax profits dropped to \u00a33.8m in the six months to June, from \u00a310.5m a year earlier. Chief executive Nic Budden said: Our performance has been resilient in the context of a London property market that has been further impacted by unprecedented economic and political uncertainty. Whilst sales commissions in the second quarter as a whole were down 3% versus prior year, sales exchanges and our under offer pipeline weakened through June and the early part of July. Shares in AstraZeneca have crashed more than 16%, after the drugmaker suffered a major setback with the failure of an key lung cancer trial. The shares plunged as low as \u00a342.71, wiping about \u00a310bn off the company\u2019s market value. The long-awaited initial results from the Mystic study found that a combination of two injectable immunotherapy drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab, failed to help patients. Chief medical officer Sean Bohen described the results as \u201cdisappointing\u201d but said the trial would continue to assess overall survival. The news came as Britain\u2019s second-biggest pharmaceuticals firm reported an 8% fall in revenues in the second quarter to $5.05bn at constant currencies, while core earnings per share rose 6% to 87 cents. Let\u2019s have a look at the company results. Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds has set aside another \u00a3700m to meet PPI claims, taking the PPI charge in its first half to \u00a31bn. However it has also reported its biggest first-half profit in eight years \u2013 a statutory pretax profit of \u00a32.5bn, 4% higher than last year \u2013 and lifted the interim dividend. Lloyds is reporting its first results since the government sold the last chunk of its shareholding in the lender in May, after rescuing during the financial crisis with a \u00a320.3bn bailout. Its chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio has just told journalists on a call: \u201cI have no intention of going anywhere,\u201d trying to squash speculation that he could be on the way out. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has hit $1.3146, its highest level since last September against the dollar, after last night\u2019s US Federal Reserve statement. The dollar is sliding after the Fed adopted a more cautious tone on the inflation outlook \u2013 boosting expectations that the next interest rate hike may be delayed until next year. The Fed kept rates unchanged last night and said it expected to start paring back its huge bond holdings \u201crelatively soon\u201d \u2013 cementing expectations this will start in September. But while it expects the economy to keep strengthening, it noted that inflation had declined. The Fed statement sent the dollar to 13-month lows against a basket of major currencies. The euro hit $1.1777, its highest level since early 2015. There is a raft of company results today, while the economic agenda is light. In Germany, consumer confidence reached a 16-year high, according to the GfK market research group. Its indicator rose to 10.8 going into August from 10.6 in July. Here in the UK, the latest retail sales survey from the CBI should shed some light on what\u2019s going on on the high street, a day after official figures showed that the British economy remains stuck in a soft patch. It grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of this year, with the film industry a rare bright spot, following 0.2% growth in the first quarter. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its growth forecast for the UK to 1.7% this year, while upgrading the four biggest eurozone economies - Germany, France, Italy and Spain.

She also plans to offload 130 non-core brands and possibly sell off the unit that works on treatments for rare diseases. Walmsley, the former head of the drugmaker\u2019s consumer healthcare business, who took over from Sir Andrew Witty as chief executive in April, said the company would focus more on backing the \u201creal winners\u201d \u2013 medicines that generate substantial returns. Some 33 programmes were to be cancelled, sold or partnered. They included 13 in clinical development, including treatments for hepatitis C, psoriasis, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, and about 20 in preclinical development. Ninety-four clinical drug development programmes were in progress at Britain\u2019s biggest pharmaceuticals firm. GSK did not release the number of its preclinical programmes, but its rare diseases unit was also under review. Walmsley stressed the research-and-development budget would not be cut and that the money saved would be spent on other areas. To improve the weak late-stage drug pipeline, research would focus on just four areas \u2013 respiratory, HIV and infectious diseases, cancer and immuno-inflammation conditions such as arthritis \u2013 and they would get 80% of the research spending. \u201cWe have been much more thinly spread but also our spend per asset has been a bit low,\u201d said Walmsley. \u201cMore and more. we need to make sure we are backing the assets that are winning \u2026 We should be spending where we believe we have an asset that can be competitive, and reallocating money appropriately.\u201d Walmsley\u2019s efficiency drive will see the number of GSK\u2019s suppliers cut by a quarter by 2020, the sale of 130 minor brands such as Horlicks and MaxiNutrition in Britain and an old antibiotics business, and the streamlining of administrative processes. She wants \u00a31bn of annual cost savings by 2020, which will be used to fund the development and launch of new products and offset the impact of pressure on drug pricing. GSK already announced last week that it would sell its Horlicks UK brand, shut the Slough factory where the malt drink is made, ditch plans for a new biopharmaceutical factory in Cumbria and outsource some manufacturing from its Worthing site in West Sussex, with the loss of 320 jobs in Britain. Walmsley said GSK would make the US its \u201cNo 1 priority market\u201d \u2013 adding this had nothing to do with Brexit. GSK\u2019s revenues in the second quarter rose 12% to \u00a37.3bn, boosted by the weak pound (they were up 3% at constant exchange rates).

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Sky, Jeremy Darroch, is cashing in \u00a311.5m in shares, the company announced as it reported a hefty fall in annual profits. Darroch and Sky\u2019s finance chief, Andrew Griffith, are to sell a combined 1.9m shares, worth \u00a318.3m at Thursday\u2019s share price of \u00a39.65, which were awarded as part of Sky\u2019s long-term incentive plan. In 2015 and 2016, Darroch\u2019s total remuneration was \u00a317.9m and \u00a34.7m respectively. Darroch has also been awarded 600,000 shares under the incentive scheme, worth \u00a35.8m at the current share price. Griffith received 350,000, worth \u00a33.4m. They will vest in July 2019, subject to hitting performance targets. The broadcaster, which is waiting to see whether Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn takeover bid will be referred to competition authorities, reported a 14% fall in operating profits to \u00a31.3bn at its UK and Ireland operation. The decline was mostly due to a one-time rise in the cost of its Premier League rights deal of \u00a3629m. It said that in the UK and Ireland \u2013 its most important market, accounting for almost 90% of profits \u2013 it added 280,000 new customers in the year to the end of June, with 111,000 subscribers taking its TV services. However, the rate at which customers left Sky for rivals, a key metric watched by analysts and investors, rose from 11.2% to 11.5% over the year. The company said the rate had come down since March, but that it was too high. \u201cIt is a competitive world out there,\u201d said the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch. \u201cThere is more movement between platforms [rivals] than in the past. We need to keep focused and keep executing our plans. We have good plans in place.\u201d These plans include the creation of the 300 new tech roles, which will increase its software engineering workforce by 25%, for its Sky Labs operations in Milan, Leeds and London to keep pace with rivals such as Netflix and Amazon. The company said the staff will be tasked with driving the development of its streaming services, which are set to expand with a new service in Spain and a broadband-delivered TV service for those who cannot, or will not, have a satellite dish. Earlier this week Amazon, which runs the Prime TV service, announced it is doubling the number of research and development staff it employs in London. Earlier this month Netflix, which has grown rapidly to an estimated 6.4 million UK subscribers, passed the 100 million customer mark globally. Darroch said that services such as Netflix, which Sky does not allow customers to access via its set-top box, were not a direct threat to his business. \u201cWe try hard to be friendly with everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of our customers take Netflix alongside their bundle, not at the expense of Sky but alongside Sky.\u201d Sky is also beefing up its budget for original programmes by 25%, thought to be as much as \u00a3150m annually, as it looks to continue to reduce its reliance on sport and remain competitive with deep-pocketed rivals such as Netflix. Darroch said that with the new investment, which brings Sky\u2019s total budget for original shows to potentially as much as \u00a3750m a year, it will see four original dramas launch each quarter for each of its territories. Sky also announced the first fruit of a $250m (\u00a3190m) co-production deal with HBO, the US network behind hits such as Game of Thrones and Sopranos, a mini-series called Chernobyl based on the 1986 nuclear plant disaster. The company\u2019s total operating profits fell by 6% to \u00a31.47bn for the year, which it said was an \u201cexcellent\u201d result given the additional Premier League cost and \u00a351m spent to date getting its Sky Mobile service up and running. Darroch said the protracted process surrounding Rupert Murdoch\u2019s bid to take full control of Sky, which has so far cost it \u00a316m in advisory fees, was not affecting the day-to-day running of the business.",

    "webTitle": "Lloyds takes fresh \u00a31bn hit from PPI compensation claims", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has taken a fresh \u00a31.6bn hit in the first six months of the year to cope with a new wave of claims from consumers missold payment protection insurance and to rectify treatment of mistreated mortgage customers. The figure includes an additional \u00a31bn charge for PPI \u2013 a scandal that has now cost the bank \u00a318.1bn since it first started taking provisions in 2011. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the bank\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged that the costs marred what he described as \u201can important day for Lloyds\u201d as it is the first set of results since the government sold off all its shares after the 2008 bailout. As the bank reported a 4% rise in first half profits to \u00a32.5bn, Horta-Os\u00f3rio also said the bank would always incur costs for redress to customers as a cost of doing business. In addition to the \u00a31bn PPI charge, the bank set aside another \u00a3540m in the first half. This includes a previously announced \u00a3100m for compensating customers hit by the HBOS Reading fraud for which two former employees were jailed in February and other issues, including the misselling of packaged bank accounts \u2013 where insurance and other products are bundled into current accounts \u2013 and compensating customers whose mortgage arrears were mishandled. The bank announced it was reimbursing about 590,000 customers following a review of the way it handled mortgage holders who were in arrears and has set aside a total of \u00a3552m to tackle the issue. The Financial Conduct Authority said \u00a3283m of this would be paid to customers after the the bank had acknowledged that when customers fell into arrears, it did not always do enough to ensure their arrears payment plans were affordable and sustainable. Another \u00a358m will be used to cover the administrative costs of paying the compensation, while another \u00a3212m is related to arrears handling of unsecured lending. There was no increase in the provision for the HBOS Reading fraud despite the TV celebrity Noel Edmonds increasing his claim to \u00a3300m \u2013 three times the amount set aside for all 67 victims. The banking group\u2019s \u00a32.5bn half-year profits were the largest in eight years \u2013 since taxpayers pumped \u00a320bn into the bank as it took over HBOS at the height of the crisis \u2013 but its shares slipped to 68p as they were lower than analysts\u2019 expectations. The bank is paying a dividend of 1p a share. The additional charges for misconduct \u2013 described as \u201cstubbornly high\u201d by analysts at Jefferies \u2013 were larger than had been expected as the PPI scandal continued to dominate the figures. Lloyds said the latest provision was needed because complaints had increased to 9,000 a month ahead of the FCA\u2019s time bar on complaints of August 2019. As a result of a turnaround programme put in place by Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the bank is now focused on the UK and faces questions about its exposure to the economy at a time of Brexit and concerns voiced by officials at the Bank of England about the growth in lending to customers on credit cards and personal loans and to buy cars. But the Lloyds chief executive said he was confident about the UK economy, which he insisted \u201cremains resilient\u201d. \u201cInflation is however now rising above disposable income given the recent depreciation in sterling and, while this may affect consumption going forward, the economy should benefit from rising exports and earnings from foreign assets,\u201d he said. He defended the bank\u2019s exposure to credit cards \u2013 the bank has taken over MBNA \u2013 and car lending, where the bank has a 14% market share through its Lex Autolease and Black Horse arms. Credit card lending had risen 1% a year over the last six years, he said. Horta-Os\u00f3rio \u2013 who is facing speculation that he will leave now that the taxpayer stake has been sold \u2013 said he was \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d and is working on the next strategic plan which will be announced alongside full-year results in February.",

    "webTitle": "AstraZeneca shares dive after failure in key lung cancer drug trial", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than \u00a310bn has been wiped off the market value of AstraZeneca after a major setback in a key lung cancer drug trial sent its shares plunging by more than 16%. The problems heaped further pressure on Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of Britain\u2019s second-biggest pharmaceuticals company, who refused to deny reports that he was close to joining the Israeli generic drugs company Teva. Soriot declined to comment directly on the \u201crumours\u201d, but stressed: \u201cI\u2019m not a quitter. In my professional life I\u2019ve experienced good times and not so good times. You put your head down and focus on the goal.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m impressed with the progress we\u2019ve made. I\u2019m proud to be the CEO of this company and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing on our journey ahead ... I\u2019m committed to delivering our strategy of returning to growth.\u201d Initial results from the closely watched Mystic drug study showed that a combination of two injectable immuno-therapies, Imfinzi (durvalumab) and tremelimumab, was no more effective than chemotherapy at halting the growth of tumours in lung cancer patients. Imfinzi is already approved for bladder cancer in the US. The study forms a key part of Soriot\u2019s promise to rebuild the company\u2019s drugs pipeline and boost revenues to $45bn by 2023, after rejecting a $118bn (\u00a369bn) takeover bid from US rival Pfizer in 2014. AstraZeneca shares dragged down the FTSE 100 index, suffering their biggest daily fall to as low as \u00a342.60 at one point, well below the Pfizer offer of \u00a355 a share. Soriot said the Mystic trial would continue to assess overall survival and noted: \u201cIt takes time for immuno-oncology products to have an effect. The drug works, but it takes longer. It doesn\u2019t behave like chemotherapy.\u201d However, many City analysts are doubtful that the final results from the Mystic trials in 2018 will be much better for a therapy that was forecast to have peak sales of $4bn in 2023. Ketan Patel, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, said: \u201cIt is difficult to think of a time when a large-cap pharmaceutical company has suffered such a large setback in share price in one day. This pipeline failure will only add further pressure on Pascal Soriot, who promised much when he rebuffed a premium bid by Pfizer in 2014.\u201d Drug companies are racing to develop immunotherapies, which enhance the immune system\u2019s ability to fight tumours and promise to revolutionise cancer care. Lung cancer is seen as the biggest market opportunity. The Mystic setback came as AstraZeneca reported another drop in revenues in the second quarter, hit by a loss of patents on blockbuster medicines such as the cholesterol pill Crestor. Revenues fell by 8% at constant currencies to $5.05bn in the second quarter, while core earnings per share (EPS) \u2013 a closely watched measure of profitability \u2013 rose by 6% to 87 cents. AstraZeneca made a pretax profit of $492m compared with a $30m loss a year earlier. The company reiterated its outlook for the full year that revenue would decline at a low to mid single-digit percentage rate, with EPS dropping by a percentage in the low-to-mid teens. Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said: \u201cMystic has been a key component of AstraZeneca\u2019s long-term growth. With the failure of Mystic, at least on the progression-free survival endpoints, now likely to be fully factored into expectations, the dividend may now look less safe and we expect some investors will start to question its long-term sustainability, despite prior reassurances from management. However, the company still has a number of other interesting pipelines.\u201d In better news, AstraZeneca announced positive trial results for its lung cancer pill Tagrisso. It also unveiled a collaboration with US rival Merck to study cancer drug combinations using AstraZeneca\u2019s treatment Lynparza, which is approved for ovarian cancer, but could be used for other types of cancer when combined with immunotherapies. Merck will pay AstraZeneca up to $8.5bn in exchange for half of future Lynparza sales.",

This pipeline failure will only add further pressure on Pascal Soriot, who promised much when he rebuffed a premium bid by Pfizer in 2014.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/26/gsk-chief\">GSK to cut drug development projects to focus on 'winners'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Drug companies are racing to develop immunotherapies, which enhance the immune system\u2019s ability to fight tumours and promise to revolutionise cancer care.

With the failure of Mystic, at least on the progression-free survival endpoints, now likely to be fully factored into expectations, the dividend may now look less safe and we expect some investors will start to question its long-term sustainability, despite prior reassurances from management.

      "bodyText": "Profits at London-focused estate agent Foxtons have plunged by 64%, hurt by slowing demand and increased economic uncertainty. Foxtons said pre-tax profits in the first half of this year dropped to \u00a33.8m from \u00a310.5m in the same period of 2016. Group revenue fell 15% to \u00a358.5m in the period. Once known for its pioneering coffee shop-style outlets and fleet of Mini cars, Foxtons floated in 2013 ahead of a market peak and has since failed more than once to meet market expectations. The company has been warning since 2014 that double-digit price rises and strong demand in London were cooling, hitting its profits. Foxtons chief executive Nic Budden blamed \u201cunprecedented economic and political uncertainty\u201d for the fall in profits. Sales revenue crashed 29% to \u00a322.2m in the period, with Foxtons saying the performance was set against a surge in the first quarter last year, when transactions were brought forward ahead of the stamp duty surcharge on buy-to-let investments and second homes. The estate agent again also pointed to \u201cinflationary pressures on household incomes\u201d. Budden said in March that the London market was \u201cseverely impacted\u201d by the Brexit vote, which he claimed had led to a \u201csubstantial reduction in property sales transactions\u201d. The numbers come after official figures showed annual house price growth cooled down further in May. Britain\u2019s housing market has slowed sharply since last June\u2019s vote to leave the EU, when prices were growing by almost 10% a year. The UK\u2019s third-largest housebuilder, Taylor Wimpey, said earlier that it believed the risk of material impact on the market from the EU referendum in the short term has significantly reduced. Revenue from lettings, a strong area for the firm that could be hit as the government introduces a ban on one-off tenant fees, fell by 2% to \u00a332.1m. The letting fees, which are to cover the cost of conducting viewings, verifying references and drawing up contracts, have become an increasingly important money-earner for the industry, averaging \u00a3337. Lettings now represent 55% of Foxtons\u2019 revenue. \u201cAs the lettings market grows, it is becoming more complex too, with significant new regulation, legislation and tax changes introduced in recent years,\u201d the company said in a statement. In the longer term, while recent political events have produced uncertainty for buyers and sellers, Foxtons said it expected London to remain a highly attractive property market for both sales and lettings.",

      "bodyText": "Suppose our fire department was staffed with out-of-shape incompetents who didn\u2019t know how to handle a firehose. That would be really bad news, but it wouldn\u2019t be obvious most of the time because we don\u2019t often see major fires. The fire department\u2019s inadequacy would become apparent only when a major fire hit, and we were left with a vast amount of unnecessary death and destruction. This is essentially the story of modern economics. The problem is not that modern economics lacks the tools needed to understand the economy. Just as with firefighting, the basics have been well known for a long time. The problem is with the behavior and the incentive structure of the practitioners. There is overwhelming pressure to produce work that supports the status quo (for example, redistributing to the rich), that doesn\u2019t question authority, and that is needlessly complex. The result is a discipline in which much of the work is of little use, except to legitimate the existing power structure. In terms of the poor quality of work, it is easy to point to the failure to recognize the size and risks posed by the housing bubble in the last decade. This failure has been unbelievably costly to the US and the rest of the world. If we compare the most recent estimates of the potential GDP of the US economy from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) with the projections made in 2008, before the severity of the crash was recognized, the difference is $1.8tn. This is an annual figure; it implies a loss of $18tn over the course of the decade. This amount averages out to more than $54,000 for every person in the country. Other countries have seen even larger losses. CBO is not God, so it could have been overly optimistic before the crash and is arguably too pessimistic at present. But even if we cut the number in half, we are still looking at a loss of $9tn over the course of a decade, or $27,000 per person. It is also worth noting that CBO\u2019s numbers are useful here not only because they are seen as authoritative, but they are in the center of the profession by design. CBO raises or lowers its numbers if they are out of line with the consensus of economic forecasters. The retrospective analyses of the overall crash have focused on the financial crisis specifically. These analyses have worked hard to convince people that seeing an impending financial crisis is an extremely difficult undertaking, but the reality is that the financial crisis was very much secondary. The overwhelming reason for the downturn and the weak recovery was the collapse of housing bubbles in the US and elsewhere that were driving growth. It was not difficult to recognize these bubbles. House prices had risen at an unprecedented pace in the years from the mid-1990s until the crash, with no remotely plausible basis in the fundamentals of the housing market. This could be seen by a variety of measures, but most obviously from the fact that rents were still following the overall rate of inflation, as they ordinarily do. The record vacancy rate \u2013 even before the crash \u2013 might also have been a red flag, especially to people who believe in supply and demand determining prices. Also, the fact that housing was driving the economy was clear from the record share of residential construction in GDP, as well as an unprecedented consumption boom driven by housing wealth. Of course these sources of demand would disappear when the bubble burst; what could anyone expect to replace six percentage points of GDP in annual demand (around $1.1tn in today\u2019s economy)? When I tried to raise these issues in years prior to the crash, my arguments were largely laughed off by a wide range of economists. I didn\u2019t have the stature, and besides, the argument was far too simple. This is not the first time that I had a problem with making arguments that were too simple. Back at the time of the debate over President George W Bush\u2019s social security privatization plan, I pointed out that his administration\u2019s assumed rates of return in the stock market were impossible given the current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios in the market and the economic growth rates assumed by the social security trustees. This was an argument based on simple algebra. Brad DeLong wanted to make this into a Brookings paper and enlisted Paul Krugman in the effort. Together they produced a paper (generously leaving me as lead author) that had an intertemporal optimization model with declining labor force growth as its key feature. (You don\u2019t have to know what an intertemporal optimization model is; just that it added complexity.) This model had nothing to do with the underlying point (the stock market would yield the assumed returns if its price-to-earnings ratio was near its historic average of 15, rather than the P/E level near 25 that we were seeing at the time), but it was necessary to have something more complex than simple algebra to be taken seriously at Brookings. It is easy to extend the list of failings in the economics profession. It is just now becoming accepted that our pattern of trade imposes substantial costs on large segments of the working population. This didn\u2019t require any new or novel innovations. This is a prediction of the completely mainstream Stolper-Samuelson theorem, first published three-quarters of a century ago. And why is there so little research devoted to analysis of alternatives to patent financing of prescription drug research? The markups associated with patent protection in the sector are equivalent to tariffs of many thousand percent. Every competent economist knows that a gap that large between a government-protected price and a free-market price is a recipe for massive waste and corruption. The gap between patent-protected drug prices and free-market prices is now approaching $400bn a year in the US alone (more than 2% of GDP). This doesn\u2019t require new economic thinking; it requires economists who know introductory economics. And how about a little accountability for economists when they mess up? There is much literature on the importance of being able to dismiss workers who do not perform their jobs well. We all know and expect that a dishwasher who keeps breaking the dishes or a custodian who can\u2019t clean the toilets loses his job. I have suggested that economists who prescribe policies that turn out badly, or who can\u2019t see multitrillion dollar housing bubbles coming whose collapse sinks the economy, ought to pay a price in terms of their careers. Invariably people think I am joking. When they realize I am serious, they think I am crazy or vindictive. Leaving aside motives, let me just speak to the economics. If we have a profession in which people are rewarded with high pay and career advancement for saying the same thing as everyone else, and never face any consequences when the accepted wisdom proves to be wrong, then we should expect to see economists like the firefighters mentioned at the beginning of this piece. They aren\u2019t qualified to do the job and our only hope is that we don\u2019t see any more major fires. This piece was first published on democracyjournal.org",

The record vacancy rate \u2013 even before the crash \u2013 might also have been a red flag, especially to people who believe in supply and demand determining prices.</p> <p>Also, the fact that housing was driving the economy was clear from the record share of residential construction in GDP, as well as an unprecedented consumption boom driven by housing wealth. Of course these sources of demand would disappear when the bubble burst; what could anyone expect to replace six percentage points of GDP in annual demand (around $1.1tn in today\u2019s economy)?</p> <p>When I tried to raise these issues in years prior to the crash, my arguments were largely laughed off by a wide range of economists. I didn\u2019t have the stature, and besides, the argument was far too simple. This is not the first time that I had a problem with making arguments that were too simple.</p> <p>Back at the time of the debate over President George W Bush\u2019s social security privatization plan, I pointed out that his administration\u2019s assumed rates of return in the stock market were impossible given the current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios in the market and the economic growth rates assumed by the social security trustees. This was an argument based on simple algebra.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/j-bradford-delong\">Brad DeLong</a> wanted to make this into a Brookings paper and enlisted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-krugman\">Paul Krugman</a> in the effort. Together they produced a paper (generously leaving me as lead author) that had an intertemporal optimization model with declining labor force growth as its key feature. (You don\u2019t have to know what an intertemporal optimization model is; just that it added complexity.) </p> <p>This model had nothing to do with the underlying point (the stock market would yield the assumed returns if its price-to-earnings ratio was near its historic average of 15, rather than the P/E level near 25 that we were seeing at the time), but it was necessary to have something more complex than simple algebra to be taken seriously at Brookings.</p> <p>It is easy to extend the list of failings in the economics profession. It is just now becoming accepted that our pattern of trade imposes substantial costs on large segments of the working population. This didn\u2019t require any new or novel innovations. This is a prediction of the completely mainstream <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolper%E2%80%93Samuelson_theorem\">Stolper-Samuelson theorem</a>, first published three-quarters of a century ago.</p> <p>And why is there so little research devoted to analysis of alternatives to patent financing of prescription drug research? The markups associated with patent protection in the sector are equivalent to tariffs of many thousand percent. Every competent economist knows that a gap that large between a government-protected price and a free-market price is a recipe for massive waste and corruption. The gap between patent-protected drug prices and free-market prices is now approaching $400bn a year in the US alone (more than 2% of GDP). This doesn\u2019t require new economic thinking; it requires economists who know introductory economics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/apr/06/kate-raworth-doughnut-economics-new-economics\">Old economics is based on false \u2018laws of physics\u2019 \u2013 new economics can save us | Kate Raworth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And how about a little accountability for economists when they mess up? There is much literature on the importance of being able to dismiss workers who do not perform their jobs well. We all know and expect that a dishwasher who keeps breaking the dishes or a custodian who can\u2019t clean the toilets loses his job.</p> <p>I have suggested that economists who prescribe policies that turn out badly, or who can\u2019t see multitrillion dollar housing bubbles coming whose collapse sinks the economy, ought to pay a price in terms of their careers. Invariably people think I am joking. When they realize I am serious, they think I am crazy or vindictive.</p> <p>Leaving aside motives, let me just speak to the economics. If we have a profession in which people are rewarded with high pay and career advancement for saying the same thing as everyone else, and never face any consequences when the accepted wisdom proves to be wrong, then we should expect to see economists like the firefighters mentioned at the beginning of this piece.

Five of the top 10 most jam-packed trains from spring 2016 and two from autumn were operated by Southern, with Department for Transport monitors recording 242 passengers squeezed on to two cars on the 5.40am service from Uckfield to London Bridge. In the autumn, 1,366 passengers were on a Southern train with space for 640, as it approached London Bridge from East Grinstead at 8.20am. Six of the other most crowded services were Thameslink or Great Northern trains, part of the same Govia franchise as Southern, and two more were evening London Midland departures from Euston to Crewe, also operated by Govia. Only TransPennine Express rivalled Southern for overcrowding, with four trains in total in the two seasonal top 10s. At worst, 361 passengers squeezed on to a four-car Glasgow to Manchester airport train designed for 191, as it passed Oxford Road station in Manchester. The statistics confirm that there are in total more passengers than seats on trains arriving in central London every morning, the only UK city where this is the case. Half of daily arrivals into London are in the morning peak, whereas in other cities this figure is around one-third. More than 583,000 passengers travel into the capital every morning by train, compared to 42,000 in Birmingham. The biggest percentage growth in rush hour train usage was in Manchester and Leeds last year, both at more than 7%. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, signalled last week that he was planning to scrap first-class carriages on more commuter trains in an effort to ease overcrowding. Separate compartments have already been reduced on shorter routes, and the Southeastern franchise is set to eliminate more first-class seating when it is renewed. All of the most crowded services found by DfT researchers had first class compartments. Last year\u2019s figures showed the busiest 2015 train was a Thameslink service, with Glasgow-Manchester airport trains close behind.",

Chairman Peter Bazalgette, when he wasn\u2019t crowing about Love Island (please stop), offered an interesting statistic: Netflix\u2019s share of viewing in Britain is about 4%, which roughly equates to that of a successful digital channel. The figure understates Netflix\u2019s cultural impact. Its audiences will also probably continue to grow and fuel the shift towards targeted digital advertising, where ITV has been slow out of the blocks. Even so, live TV is still reckoned to account for 80% of overall viewing. That should mean that ITV\u2019s virtual monopoly on primetime ad slots in Britain should remain a valuable asset for a while yet.

It is not defenceless. Emma Walmsley seeks long-term health for GSK All chief executives of GlaxoSmithKline, it seems, start their reigns by declaring they are on a mission to improve productivity in the pharmaceutical labs. Sir Andrew Witty created \u201cdiscovery performance units\u201d to get the scientists to work more efficiently. Now Emma Walmsley, his successor, is dishing out stiffer prescriptions. She is cutting 30 development programmes and declaring that 80% of the capital will be allocated to just four \u201cpriority\u201d therapy areas, including respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases, where GSK is already big. The new policy makes sense. Drug companies must spread themselves thinly when they are pursuing original discoveries because they don\u2019t know what they will find. But in the development stage, which is when the bills become huge, they cannot bet on everything. If you\u2019re spending $4.5bn (\u00a33.5bn) a year on R&amp;D, taking a hard-headed commercial view of the best prospects sounds entirely fair. Investors sounded bored, however. The share price fell 2.5%, which wasn\u2019t solely caused by GSK\u2019s slight trim to earnings estimates after choosing to accelerate the launch of an important HIV drug. Maybe a long-term story of self-improvement was bound to sound dull but, whatever the reason, Walmsley should not be deterred. She has committed to GSK\u2019s current corporate structure, which houses complex pharmaceuticals, vaccines and consumer products under one roof. After generic competition for asthma drug Advair arrives (probably next year), GSK\u2019s next big patent cliff isn\u2019t until 2026. The same-again dividend is virtually guaranteed for this year and next. She can afford to take a long-term approach.

      "bodyText": "A regulatory regime intended to crack down on the behaviour of bank bosses is to be extended to 47,000 firms including dentists, gyms and tool hire companies that offer credit to customers. The Financial Conduct Authority estimated that the new regime would cost firms \u00a3550m, with up to \u00a3190m of ongoing costs for the firms involved. It had been expected that the additional firms would be covered by the senior managers and certification regime (SMCR) from 2018, although the FCA\u2019s consultation document does not indicate if this is still the timetable. The SMCR came into force for almost 900 banks and building societies in March 2016 and was intended to tackle the fact that no bank bosses were held to account when their firms collapsed in 2008. It requires the responsibilities of top managers to be spelt out and for them to certify their key staff are suitable for their roles. This certification must now happen annually, whereas under the previous system the FCA approved individuals only once, unless they moved roles. The FCA\u2019s consultation paper sets out five \u201cconduct\u201d rules for firms: act with integrity; act with due care, skill and diligence; be open and cooperative with regulators; pay due regard to customer interests and treat them fairly; and observe proper standards of market conduct. The Treasury had called for the broadening of the new regime two years ago when it also dropped a plan to \u201creverse the burden of proof\u201d for managers, which would have forced them to demonstrate they had done the right thing if wrongdoing emerged on their watch. Marian Bloodworth, an employment partner at law firm Kemp Little, said: \u201cThe change will also mean the end of the FCA register for the majority of financial services employees ... This has been a cause for concern for those in the existing regime already, as it means there is no publicly available list of advisers for customers to review.\u201d The FCA warned that some cost increases on firms will pass through to consumers in the form of higher prices, while senior managers \u201cmay demand bigger pay deals\u201d.",
