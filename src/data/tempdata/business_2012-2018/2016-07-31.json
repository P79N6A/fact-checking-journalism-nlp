      "bodyText": "Bank lending to businesses is set to fall in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, while demand for consumer credit and mortgages will also weaken as people spend less on big-ticket items, a report predicts. Business lending is predicted to shrink by around 1% this year, 1.8% next year and a further 1% in 2018, according to the EY Item Club\u2019s latest report on financial services. Lending had been expected to rise this year and beyond, after a steady decline since the financial crisis. Item warned that lending would slow as businesses delayed investments and consumers postponed the purchase of big-ticket items, including property, as they waited for details on both the timetable for the UK to leave the EU and the results of negotiations. Item has already slashed its predictions for UK economic growth following the referendum from 2.6% to 1.9% this year and from 2.3% to 0.4% in 2017. Mortgage lending and consumer credit are still expected to grow, but at a slower pace than previously thought. Annual growth in mortgage lending is set to fall to less than 1% a year on average over the next three years, from 3% in 2014 and 2015. Omar Ali, UK financial services managing partner at EY, said: \u201cWe had hoped 2016 would be the year that total lending recovered to pre-crisis levels, but with the revised economic outlook this looks increasingly unlikely. Whilst banks are still willing to lend, there is a strong sense of wait and see from business and consumers as they await details of what Brexit will look like in reality.\u201d The UK banking sector passed the latest EU-wide health checks on Friday. The Bank of England said the stress tests, which were overseen by the pan-European banking regulator, showed that the British financial industry was resilient enough to cope with downturns in the economy and the markets. RBS and HSBC will report interim results this week. RBS is expected to post a \u00a31.2bn loss for the second quarter on Friday. Analysts are hoping for an update on the spinoff of Williams &amp; Glyn. The European commission has demanded that 300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches be sold in return for RBS\u2019s \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout, but RBS has already said it could miss the deadline, which has already been extended to December 2017. HSBC, Britain\u2019s biggest bank, is likely to unveil a big drop in first-half profits on Wednesday, and some analysts have flagged concerns about the dividend. Pre-tax profits are expected to fall by around 20%. The bank has been cutting back its operations, with the \u00a33.9bn sale of its Brazilian division completed in July.",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons is to provide a post-referendum boost to shoppers by cutting the price of more than 1,000 products by an average of 18%. The reductions are the latest phase of the battle between Britain\u2019s largest supermarkets to win back customers who have turned to the discounters Aldi and Lidl. They will be introduced from Monday, and include cutting the price of 1kg of beef mince from \u00a33.86 to \u00a33 and 750g of chicken thighs from \u00a32.25 to \u00a31.57. The supermarket is also reducing the price of toiletries and seasonal fruit and vegetables by as much as 56%. Overall it will cut prices on 1,045 products. The fact the reductions are being introduced after the EU referendum is significant, because analysts said the vote could lead to inflation in supermarket prices. This is because the fall in the value of sterling since the vote has made importing ingredients and products more expensive. Morrisons hopes the price cuts will reassure its customers. Consumer confidence suffered its biggest fall in more than 26 years in July, market researchers GfK said last week, as households become gloomier about the economy and their finances following the referendum. The latest supermarket figures from Kantar Worldpanel show sales in the industry fell by 1.1% in the four weeks to 17 July, the worst performance for at least two years. Analysts, however, blamed the performance on disappointing summer weather compared with the same time last year, rather than the fallout from Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. All of the \u201cbig four\u201d grocery chains \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 suffered a decline in their sales. Andy Atkinson, Morrisons\u2019 customer and marketing director, said: \u201cWe are constantly listening to our customers and know they are concerned about whether food prices will go up following the Brexit vote, especially on imports. \u201cMorrisons is unique as a food-maker and shopkeeper, and unlike the rest of the industry manufactures food, both in our own food processing plants and our 500 stores. \u201cWe are British farming\u2019s biggest supermarket customer, which means we can better control our prices, and this latest round of crunches demonstrates our commitment to offering the best possible value to our customers this summer.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Online spending on films, music and games in the UK has bounced back, thanks to Star Wars: The Force Awakens and consumers buying the back catalogues of David Bowie and Prince. More than a third of shoppers in the physical entertainment market bought a product with the online retailer Amazon in the 12 weeks to 3 June. This helped the company to achieve its highest ever share of spending on DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs and games outside the Christmas period, according to Kantar Worldpanel. Online sales of physical entertainment products stuttered during 2015 as the high street, led by HMV, made a fightback. Consumers, however, have turned back to Amazon and other online sites because of the size of their catalogue as they look for classic songs and albums by Prince and David Bowie, who both died this year. Prince sold more albums during the 12-week period than any artist apart from Adele. Sales of CDs more than six months old grew by 9% year on year, helped by Prince and Bowie. No music titles, however, made it into the top 30 entertainment products for the quarter. Following its box office success, the latest Star Wars movie was the bestselling title in the entertainment market, with 1.8 million shoppers picking up a copy of the DVD or Blu-ray. Tesco was the big winner, taking nearly a third of all spending on the product. Tesco\u2019s overall sales fell 0.5% in the entertainment sector, meaning its market share dropped slightly to 15.2%. On the high street, HMV\u2019s sales rose 2.3% year on year, increasing its market share from 14% to 16.3%. Amazon\u2019s sales rose 0.5%, increasing its share of spending from 22.5% to 23%. Fiona Keenan, Kantar\u2019s strategic insight director, said: \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens has become the biggest Blu-ray film title since Avatar over six years ago and there are signs it has helped get people back into the market \u2013 encouraging, given the competition Blu-ray and DVDs face from digital streaming services such as Netflix. \u201cOnline spend across the industry has bounced back from declines over the past year and now accounts for over a third of spend \u2013 the highest it has been since this time in 2015. \u201cHaving the availability of a wide back catalogue means online retailers are extremely well placed to cater to changes in consumer demand, as exemplified by the recent surge in sales of Bowie and Prince albums following the death of both iconic artists earlier this year.\u201d",

A parliamentary investigation into the collapse led to accusations by Field and his fellow Labour MP Iain Wright that Green represented the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d and was overseeing the \u201csystematic plunder\u201d of the company. Green and other investors were paid \u00a3586m in dividends, rent and interest during his 15-year ownership of BHS.He sold the store for \u00a31 in March 2015 to Dominic Chappell, a serial bankrupt. Chappell\u2019s consortium extracted another \u00a317m from BHS before it collapsed earlier this year. Field has previously said that Green should write a big cheque to fix the BHS pension scheme. On Sunday he told the BBC: \u201cThe idea that it is a kangaroo court, it is just displacement therapy for him - facing up to the evil that he has done in destroying BHS, workers\u2019 jobs, and pension fund liabilities, and a need now for him to do something about it, which is write that big cheque. \u201cThis is the man that\u2019s responsible for the destruction of 11,000 jobs, putting 22,000 pensions at risk. He said he was going to \u2018fix it, fix it, fix it\u2019, when he was with us. He hasn\u2019t done so.\u201d Green declined to comment about Field\u2019s latest criticism. In his letter to Field sent on Saturday, however, the billionaire tycoon accused the Labour MP of being \u201cutterly disingenuous\u201d by suggesting he could solve the problems of the BHS pension scheme by writing a cheque. \u201cThe Pensions Regulator has its own processes that we are obliged to follow,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been pleased that recently real progress has been made with the Pensions Regulator in progressing towards a solution for the BHS pension schemes. Our team of professional advisers has been instructed to ensure that, on our side, we do all we can to drive this forward to a positive conclusion \u201cBut you should be in no doubt, Mr Field, that any solution relies on a voluntary decision on our side to support the BHS pension schemes. There is no legal liability to make any payment to support the schemes. Indeed, I am unaware of any precedent for any private company or individual doing so.\u201d Green also said Field\u2019s comments could jeopardise a deal with the Pensions Regulator. The Pensions Regulator is also understood to be looking into Arcadia, Green\u2019s main retail business, which controls Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Wallis. Arcadia has a pension deficit of \u00a3190m, despite paying Green\u2019s family a \u00a31.2bn dividend in 2005. The BHS scandal has ensured that pensions and corporate governance are top of the agenda for Theresa May\u2019s new governnment. Downing Street said this weekend that the triple lock, which guarantees rises in the state pension, would remain in place, after a former pensions minister said it would become unaffordable after 2020. Lady Altmann, who left the government in July, called for the mechanism to be scrapped and suggested that May could be more open to the idea than David Cameron. Altmann warned of the \u201cenormous\u201d cost of keeping the safeguard, under which pensions go up by the annual rate of inflation, the growth in average earnings or 2.5%, depending on which is highest.",

    "webTitle": "UK interest rates set to be cut by Bank of England on Thursday", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis this week and lower its UK growth forecasts by the biggest margin on record, in response to the uncertainty caused by the EU referendum result. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee will announce a decision on Thursday, when the latest inflation report and growth forecasts will be published. If interest rates are cut, it will be the first time they have changed since being set at 0.5% in March 2009. The MPC held off reducing official borrowing costs from their record low in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote on 23 June. However, the committee has dropped heavy hints that it will act this week when fresh forecasts for the economy are published. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, warned before the referendum that voting to leave could push Britain into a recession. The Bank\u2019s forecasts are expected to include an unprecedented downgrade of the prospects for the British economy. In May\u2019s inflation report, it forecast that the economy would grow by 2.3% this year, but economists believe this could now be slashed to less than 1%, which would be the largest downgrade in the Bank\u2019s forecasts between inflation reports since it became independent in 1997. The nine-member MPC will make its decision nearly two weeks after business and consumer surveys conducted folowing the vote to leave the EU signalled a decline in activity and confidence. Cutting borrowing costs could shore up activity in a jittery housing market by lowering mortgage costs. The Bank will also hope to boost business sentiment and companies\u2019 willingness to keep investing amid the uncertain outlook. As such, it may go further than rate cuts and announce a programme of money printing or lending schemes. The Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has called for a big package of measures to support the UK\u2019s post-referendum economy. The policymaker Martin Weale, who has previously opposed the rest of the committee and voted for rate rises, suggested that he was likely to use this week\u2019s meeting to support some form of stimulus for the economy. Some economists have warned that cutting interest rates on the basis of the early reaction to the Brexit vote would be premature, but most experts believe the Bank will want to act swiftly, and the consensus is that it will cut rates to 0.25%. In a Reuters poll of 49 economists published last week, all but three expected the Bank to cut at least 25 basis points to 0.25%. It is a stark contrast to expectations before the vote to leave the EU, when the next move in interest rates was seen as likely to be upwards. Allan Monks, an economist at JP Morgan. said: \u201cThe Bank of England seems all but certain to ease policy, with only the scale and form of easing in question.\u201d Monks is predicting a bigger cut than many of his peers in the City, pencilling in a drop in official interest rates to zero. \u201cWe see little reason for the Bank of England to restrict itself to a 25 basis point rate cut in August, in terms of both the need for a larger policy response and the Bank of England\u2019s ability to deliver one,\u201d he said. There are expectations that the Bank will expand the quantitative easing (QE) programme, whereby it creates electronic cash to buy bonds and so inject money into the financial system. But economists are wary of predicting that such a move will come as soon as this week. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said there is a mood of caution in the City after the Bank confounded many analysts by not changing interest rates in July. \u201cHaving had its fingers burnt at the July meeting, the market is understandably sceptical, as are we, about the extent of the package to be unveiled at the August meeting,\u201d he said, predicting that interest rates will be cut to 0.25%, with a possible \u00a350bn expansion of QE. In the past, the QE programme has been criticised for not providing enough help to the real economy. Adam Marshall, the acting director general at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the Bank could design the next phase of QE to help small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). \u201cIf you could package up SME debt and use QE to buy it, that could be very interesting in terms of raising money when people are risk averse,\u201d he said. There are some expectations that the Bank could revitalise the funding for lending scheme, under which it has provided incentives for high street banks to lend more to households and businesses. There is also the option of so-called helicopter money, under which a central bank prints money so that finance ministries can hand it out to citizens or spend it on big infrastructure projects. Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, said: \u201cThis option conveys visions of airborne aircraft dropping \u00a320 notes on the streets of the UK. However, in practice, a helicopter money policy would most likely take the form of the BoE buying government perpetual bonds, perhaps covering specific infrastructure projects.\u201d But economists have warned that the impact of the Bank\u2019s potential actions could be limited. \u201cInterest rate cuts and QE are not panaceas for political uncertainty,\u201d said Holger Schmieding and Kallum Pickering of Berenberg. \u201cThe crucial factor weighing on the UK growth outlook is the uncertainty relating to the Brexit negotiations and new trade deal with the EU.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The timing could hardly be better. In six months time, the annual festival of globalisation takes place in Davos, the small town in Switzerland where the World Economic Forum holds its annual meeting. The helicopters and the limos will bring the bigwigs up from Zurich into the high Alps for four days, when they will talk about the need for inclusive growth and a capitalism that works for everybody. At the end of the week, the choppers and the limos will take them back down the mountain and nothing will change. Next year might be different though. By chance, the Friday of Davos week in 2017 falls on 20 January, the day when the next US president will be sworn in. It could be Donald Trump. As a businessman, Trump would fit in well at Davos. He is a billionaire who likes to cut a deal, and Davos is full of filthy rich people who hoof it to Switzerland each January not just for the skiing and the fondue but to closet themselves in a quiet room well away from the TV cameras to do some business. As a president, though, Davos would have some issues with Trump. The WEF priesthood adheres to an orthodox creed: a belief in free markets, open borders and liberalised trade. Its dream is to create a tech-savvy, barrier-free, global village. As far as one can tell from his various and often contradictory policy statements, Trump is running for office on a completely different ticket. He is a throwback to a different era, when the US was protectionist and isolationist, which it was for much of its history. It has only been since the end of the second world war that it has championed free markets and taken on the role of global policeman. No question, Hillary Clinton would be much more to Davos\u2019s taste. To say Trump\u2019s economic policies are a work in progress is something of an understatement. It is not clear how he squares promises of tax cuts three times bigger than those offered by George W Bush with his insistence that the US national debt is too high. Like Bush and Ronald Reagan, he seems to set great store by the idea, popularised by the economist Arthur Laffer, that tax cuts generate higher levels of growth and so pay for themselves. This has not, however, worked in the past. Trump has also equivocated about the minimum wage. At one time, he said setting the rate should be left to individual states. More recently he has proposed that he would raise the national minimum wage. As far as Wall Street is concerned, Trump has been more like a traditional Republican, saying he would repeal the Dodd-Frank Act, which sought to curb the excesses of the financial sector. This looks curious for someone trying to surf a tidal wave of populist anger against the bankers. According to the traditional rules of politics, Trump should not have a prayer. He is loud and obnoxious. He seems to enjoy insulting large sections of the US electorate, women and the Hispanic community in particular. As Russell Jones said in a recent note for Llewellyn Consulting, his inventory of policy proposals are striking for their naivety and incoherence. \u201cIt is a litany of simplistic ideas, with no guiding principle, little clear direction and no overarching notion of how these various initiatives might fit together to deliver short-term macro-economic stability, or improved long-term growth potential and flexibility.\u201d The Labour peer, Meghnad Desai, offered a more positive appraisal in an analysis for the OMFIF thinktank. If he became president, Trump would be the first occupant of the White House since Eisenhower not to have held elected office, although Ike did of course mastermind the invasion of France in 1944. Desai envisages Trump doing what Eisenhower did in the 1950s, with a big programme of investment in the country\u2019s old and decaying public infrastructure. With interest rates so low, Desai says a capital spending programme of 5% of US GDP would raise $900bn (\u00a3680bn), draw in private investment and go a long way to fulfilling Trump\u2019s goals of boosting growth and raising living standards. So could he really win? You only have to look at the way Clinton has been forced to take a tougher line on trade and promise her own infrastructure package to receive the answer. Few US political experts gave Trump a prayer of securing the Republican nomination when he first announced his run. They take him a lot more seriously now, as well they should, because if the opinion polls are right he will give Clinton a real run for her money. Trump\u2019s core economic message is simple. If globalisation is such a great idea, why is it that only 15% of the additional growth the US has generated since the 1970s has gone to the workers? The other 85% has boosted corporate income, which helps to explain why the pressure for free trade deals is coming from the boardroom rather than the factory floor. Clearly, there is an element of nostalgia to this, but Trump\u2019s appeal is not just about nostalgia. The fact is that the US middle class, which in Britain we would call the working class, really did enjoy more rapid increases in living standards and a much higher degree of job security three or four decades ago. It is also true that the offshoring of production has brought benefits through cheaper imports, but these gains tend to seem more nebulous than lost jobs and year after year of flat or falling pay. A quick look at what has been happening to the US economy in recent years sheds light on the problem. As in Britain, jobs have been created but productivity has been exceptionally weak. One reason is that companies have not been investing. Rather executives have been borrowing money cheaply for share buyback schemes that boost the value of the equity they hold in their own companies. They have gorged themselves at the expense of the wider US economy and been able to do so because organised labour is so weak. There is no chance Trump will be championing new rights for unions, but he is the beneficiary of a raw form of populist politics. Parallels can be drawn with the great recession of 2008 and 2009, the buildup to which was a prolonged affair. Asset bubble followed asset bubble. Financial crisis followed financial crisis. There were opportunities to change course after the peso crisis in Mexico, after the Asian financial crisis and after the dotcom bubble collapsed. The warnings were not heeded and the disease worked its way from the periphery of the global economy to its American core. Politics is following the same pattern. Trump could win.",

There is no chance Trump will be championing new rights for unions, but he is the beneficiary of a raw form of populist politics.<br></p> <p>Parallels can be drawn with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/07/global-financial-crisis-key-stages\">great recession of 2008 and 2009</a>, the buildup to which was a prolonged affair. Asset bubble followed asset bubble. Financial crisis followed financial crisis. There were opportunities to change course after the peso crisis in Mexico, after the Asian financial crisis and after the dotcom bubble collapsed. The warnings were not heeded and the disease worked its way from the periphery of the global economy to its American core. Politics is following the same pattern. Trump could win.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018Hello, it\u2019s Monika!\u201d a woman next to me calls out as we enter an empty New York City studio apartment. Neither of us lives here. Neither of us has ever met the owner. We are not breaking in. We are here to help. Monika, 46, is an Alfred \u2013 a modern-day butler \u2013 and I am tagging along to one of her jobs. Forget Siri and other so-called \u201cintelligent\u201d personal assistants. Can Siri let the plumber in to repair that leaky sink? Make your bed? Wait for the cable guy? No. But Alfred can. Founded by two women in their late 20s, Hello Alfred is supposed to be an accessible and affordable way to get the help you need to balance work and personal life. The service is named after Batman\u2019s trusty butler and focuses on building relationships between clients and Alfreds. After all, once you\u2019ve signed up online, downloaded the app and had your in-person consultation, you are handing over the keys to your house. \u201cIt\u2019s a different feeling to have a human being, who you trust, who you feel is taking care of you and when you come home, you have a feeling of relief and a connection with another human being,\u201d says Marcela Sapone, one of Alfred\u2019s co-founders. \u201cYou meet almost everyone,\u201d Monika tells me, noting that sometimes people work from home or end up being sick. \u201cYou feel like you have a connection with everyone. And that\u2019s crucial. You add your personal touch to it.\u201d She has been with this particular client for about a year, but has yet to meet her. \u201cShe is one of the tidiest people I know,\u201d Monika says. The studio looks ready for a photoshoot and I wonder whether my place would look as stylish if I had a butler of my own. Monika gets right to work \u2013 disappearing in a walk-through closet (there is a bathroom on the other end) to put away dry cleaning we picked up from the building\u2019s concierge. Swiftly she transfers her client\u2019s clothes from the wire hangers they were delivered on to her own and puts them into their appropriate spots. Today is Monika\u2019s second weekly visit to this particular client\u2019s home. Alfred charges $32 a week for one visit and $58 for two visits. A typical appointment lasts an hour. Earlier this week, Monika had dropped off dry cleaning and run some other errands. Usually her duties include making the bed, taking out the garbage, getting groceries and putting them away, dealing with the clothes and letting in the cleaner sent by MyClean, a tech-enabled cleaning service. \u201cYou get to know the client better over time,\u201d Monika says as she moves over to make the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the first visit when you have to look where everything is.\u201d By now, she has finished making the bed. This client likes her pillows fluffy, Monika explains as she lines up pillows on the bed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, but a pillow likes a little bit of a harsh treatment,\u201d she adds, moving to the sofa and fluffing one pillow after another. Monika might have never met this particular client but she knows quite a bit about her. As she moves through the apartment, she picks up a stray pair of shoes to put away. She grabs an empty glass from the table and puts it into the dishwasher. Before we leave, Monika opens the refrigerator to make sure it\u2019s stocked with enough water. Satisfied, she closes it. \u201cYou learn people\u2019s habits,\u201d Monika says smiling. \u201cFor someone, one pack of paper towels is enough. For others, it\u2019s not.\u201d \u2018We accidentally made Alfred for ourselves, to solve our problem\u2019 Lack of time and too many errands is exactly how Alfred first began. Its co-founders \u2013 Sapone and Jessica Beck \u2013 met at Harvard business school. They both knew they wanted to start a business and were trying to figure out how to fit it into their everyday life. \u201cWe said: \u2018How are we going to have a family, have a career and have a personal life?\u2019\u201d said Sapone. To figure out the formula for being able to juggle all that, they turned to other women for answers. They called women in venture capital, media, and tech and asked: how are you able to do this? \u201cEveryone of them had a similar answer and that was: help. And it was usually personal help \u2013 personal assistant, a nanny, [or] their mom lived with them,\u201d explained Sapone. \u201cSo, Jess and I said: OK how can we create leverage in a more accessible way? Because at 27 years old, we couldn\u2019t afford personal assistants. So we booked help for ourselves.\u201d At the time, help came in form of Jenny \u2013 a woman they found on Craigslist. \u201cWe asked Jenny to help us with the basic chores that were time consuming: picking up dry cleaning, letting the cleaner in and grocery shopping for us. Basically, we trusted her to do what she thought was right. We gave her keys to our home and split the cost,\u201d said Sapone. At the time, she and Beck lived in the same building. \u201cOver time, our neighbors said: \u2018That\u2019s really interesting. Could we share Jenny?\u2019\u201d And so Alfred was born. \u201cWe accidentally made Alfred for ourselves, to solve our problem,\u201d says Sapone. That was back in March 2013. Over the next year, the duo encouraged their friends to sign up for the service as they ran a year-long experiment. Hello Alfred was officially launched in September 2014 at a TechCrunch Disrupt event in San Francisco, where it won $50,000. Hello Alfred differs from some of the other on-demand startups in that Alfreds are all company employees and not independent contractors, like Uber drivers for example. Some, like Monika, work nine to five, others work more flexible hours and maybe just two days a week. Employees range in age and profession \u2013 some are actors who attend auditions in between taking care of their clients and some, like Monika, are working moms. According to Sapone, the starting salary is $16 and after two months it automatically increases to $18. Alfreds can earn up to $30 an hour and are encouraged to move up the ladder and become part of corporate staff, she said. When I ask Monika how much she makes an hour, she laughs. \u201cI thought no one in this country talked about money,\u201d she says, before telling me that she makes $25 an hour. Sapone would not say exactly how much Alfred has grown in the past two years, but notes that its clients are \u201cin the thousands\u201d. At the moment, Alfred is focused on growing and improving its operations in New York, Boston and San Francisco. \u201cWe want to become very large in those three cities first before we expand,\u201d says Sapone. \u2018Come home happy\u2019 Alfred\u2019s growth has had a very direct impact on Monika, who has been with the company for over a year. \u201cWe have many, many more clients,\u201d she tells me. Back when she first started, she used to have clients in Midtown as well as in Greenwich Village where we are at the moment and had to take subways in between appointments. At one point, when she first started the job, she decided to track how many miles she walked in one day and found out that it was between 12 and 13 miles. Yet as Alfred grew, it became easier to group clients by area. Now that her clients are closer together, she does not walk as much. On a typical day, Monika has eight clients. Today, four of them live in the same building and the other four live nearby. \u201cBy itself the number of clients doesn\u2019t mean much,\u201d she explains. Instead it depends on how messy or organized the client is. Do they need you to replace candles? Water the plants? Drop off shoes to be repaired? After a while, knowing all this becomes a part of a routine especially when you have the same clients all the time, the way Alfreds do. Monika does not mind all the walking and running around required for the job. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to see new things, meet new people,\u201d she says as I walk with her back to the Alfred headquarters where she will do paperwork before wrapping up for the day. Among things that Monika dealt with today was a dry cleaning delivery that was rescheduled and a new cleaner who was running a few minutes late. The clients, of course, know nothing of this. They come home and everything is where it is supposed to be. Alfred\u2019s slogan, after all, is \u201cCome home happy\u201d. Worrying is Monika\u2019s job.",

    "webTitle": "All hail the CFPB: banking watchdog hangs in balance as election nears", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Almost, but not quite, lost in all of the noise surrounding the back-to-back presidential nominating conventions in Cleveland and Philadelphia in July was the fact that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) celebrated its fifth birthday. What does this have to do with election day? Well, depending on who wins, it might not get a sixth. The CFPB, the watchdog agency charged with ensuring that the financial markets work for ordinary consumers and to police financial institutions, was the brainchild of Elizabeth Warren, then a law professor at Harvard. Her advocacy of the financial interests of ordinary, middle-class Americans, and her understanding of the situation in which they found themselves even before the financial crisis wreaked further havoc on their personal balance sheets, catapulted her to political stardom, even as it won her a host of enemies among bankers. Today, a sizable group of Democrats still quietly mourn the fact that Warren, now a Massachusetts senator, won\u2019t be their standard bearer in November\u2019s election, and wasn\u2019t chosen as Clinton\u2019s vice-presidential candidate. Regardless of her official status, she may wield as much influence as the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. But while most Democrats celebrate Warren and her accomplishments, the Republicans deplore both the senator and the CFPB. Warren seems to have gotten under the skin of the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump. The two have traded barbs on Twitter. And as for the CFPB, well, Republican language turns downright Trumpian. Ted Cruz dubbed it \u201ca runaway agency\u201d that doesn\u2019t do much to protect consumers; the Republican party\u2019s platform described it as a \u201crogue\u201d agency that should be abolished or overhauled if those consumers are really going to be protected. I interviewed Warren in July 2009, when the CFPB was still merely a proposal, and I doubt that any of these reactions \u2013 or overreactions \u2013 would come as much of a surprise to her today. \u201cThe big banks want things to go back to the way they were,\u201d she said then, in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, and only a few months after the stock market had begun to struggle back to life. \u201cThey made billions of dollars from consumers who didn\u2019t fully understand the products these banks were selling. That whole process brought this economy to the brink of collapse and must be changed. We all have an interest in a safer consumer credit market.\u201d And while hardball Washington politics meant that when it came time for Barack Obama to nominate the first head of the CFPB, he tapped Richard Cordray, the former attorney general of Ohio, rather than Warren, who stood beside the president and Cordray at the Rose Garden ceremony. It had been made very clear that, if Obama had nominated her, the Senate would never have confirmed her in the role. That didn\u2019t stop the CFPB from becoming what Jennifer Lee, a partner in the banking and financial services practice of Dorsey and Whitney (and herself a former CFPB enforcement attorney) describes as \u201cone of the most powerful and aggressive agencies in the country\u201d. Its accomplishments, she argues, \u201care voluminous for a baby agency\u201d. Lee says one of the reasons the CFPB has been successful is the way it has responded to its track record. \u201cWith each successive new development, the agency gets emboldened to do more,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe current appetite for increased enforcement is not going to change.\u201d That\u2019s clearly true. Even as the Republicans were rattling their freshly sharpened sabers, the agency announced a new line of attack. This time, it plans to crack down on abusive debt collection practices, tightening the rules that govern the industry. The goal is to ensure that debt collectors are pursuing those who actually owe the debt, that they aren\u2019t harassing debtors, and that they abide by statutes of limitations barring them from trying to collect on older debt. That would make a significant difference to the estimated one in three Americans who have an a debt that has reached the stage where it\u2019s in the hands of a collection agency. So far, the CFPB\u2019s pursuit of financial institutions, from banks to payday lenders, that have relied on a lack of financial sophistication or understanding on the part of consumers to take advantage of them has resulted in the payment of about $11.7bn to more than 27 million of those consumers directly. Another $500m or so has been generated in penalties. The largest of those settlements was with Ocwen, the country\u2019s biggest nonbank mortgage loan servicer, under the terms of which the company refunded $2bn to 185,000 borrowers whose mortgages were underwater. \u201cOcwen took advantage of borrowers at every stage of the (mortgage) process,\u201d Cordray said at the time. This is pretty much what Warren hoped the agency would accomplish when she drew up the blueprint for it following the financial crisis. \u201cAny market in which a credit card agreement is more than 30 pages long and mortgage documentation runs into the hundreds of pages \u2013 none of which is designed to be easily read and understood by the consumer \u2013 is a broken market,\u201d she said. Not all banks suffer from this: smaller banks, for instance, that offer more straightforward products \u201cget drowned out by multimillion dollar advertising campaigns\u201d for credit cards and mortgages by bigger institutions that may not offer consumers such favorable terms. She saw part of her mission as levelling the playing field. \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise that the biggest banks with the most powerful lobbyists seem ready to declare all-out war on a readable contract and other minimal consumer protections.\u201d Unsurprisingly, the same groups are still at war today with the CFPB, which carries on Warren\u2019s mission. Even before the November election, warning lights were flashing. Jeb Hensarling, the Republican member of Congress who chairs the House financial services committee, has declared he won\u2019t rest until he tosses post-financial crisis reforms like the Dodd-Frank Act \u201con to the trash heap of history\u201d. Hensarling is also a fierce opponent of the CFPB, which has calls a \u201cdangerously out-of-control agency\u201d. Hensarling\u2019s plan to repeal Dodd-Frank and replace it with a patchwork quilt of lightweight, bank-friendly rules, unveiled in June, would gut the CFPB. It would deprive the agency of the right to scrutinize some kinds of lending altogether (such as auto loans), and it would politicize the entire process. Right now, the CFPB is about as independent as any Wall Street agency can be: its head is appointed by the president and left to get on with his job, with independent funding received from the Federal Reserve. If Hensarling gets his way, the CFPB would become completely accountable to Congress, having five commissioners appointed by party leaders, and having to fight for an annual budget. In other words, the same politicians who receive lobbying funds from Wall Street would be deciding who runs the agency that protects consumers from Wall Street \u2013 and how much money that agency should get. That hasn\u2019t always worked out terribly well for the SEC, which has battled for its budget, and which is still waiting for the Senate to confirm two nominees to its five-member commission. So let\u2019s celebrate the CFPB\u2019s fifth birthday, and its success in fighting for the interests of the ordinary borrowers and debtors against the big financial institutions that seem to have the decks stacked in their favor. Let\u2019s also hope that the Republicans remember that there is tremendous bipartisan support for financial regulation, and for the agency in particular. Turning it into a scapegoat to make the banks happy could prove to be a very costly error for all concerned.",

      "body": "<p>Almost, but not quite, lost in all of the noise surrounding the back-to-back presidential nominating conventions in Cleveland and Philadelphia in July was the fact that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) celebrated its fifth birthday.<br></p> <p>What does this have to do with election day? Well, depending on who wins, it might not get a sixth.</p> <p>The CFPB, the watchdog agency charged with ensuring that the financial markets work for ordinary consumers and to police financial institutions, was <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/11/elizabeth-warren-201111\">the brainchild of Elizabeth Warren</a>, then a law professor at Harvard. </p> <p>Her advocacy of the financial interests of ordinary, middle-class Americans, and her understanding of the situation in which they found themselves even before the financial crisis wreaked further havoc on their personal balance sheets, catapulted her to political stardom, even as it won her a host of enemies among bankers.<br></p> <p>Today, a sizable group of Democrats still quietly mourn the fact that Warren, now a Massachusetts senator, won\u2019t be their standard bearer in November\u2019s election, and wasn\u2019t chosen as Clinton\u2019s vice-presidential candidate. Regardless of her official status, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-2016_us_56b4f8cee4b01d80b2462dc3\">she may wield as much influence</a> as the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. </p> <p>But while most Democrats celebrate Warren and her accomplishments, the Republicans deplore both the senator and the CFPB. Warren seems to have gotten under the skin of the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump. The two have traded barbs on Twitter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/741774067368402945\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career.

That whole process brought this economy to the brink of collapse and must be changed. We all have an interest in a safer consumer credit market.\u201d</p> <p>And while hardball Washington politics meant that when it came time for Barack Obama to nominate the first head of the CFPB, he tapped Richard Cordray, the former attorney general of Ohio, rather than Warren, who stood beside the president and Cordray at the Rose Garden ceremony. It had been made very clear that, if Obama had nominated her, the Senate would never have confirmed her in the role.</p> <p>That didn\u2019t stop the CFPB from becoming what Jennifer Lee, a partner in the banking and financial services practice of Dorsey and Whitney (and herself a former CFPB enforcement attorney) describes as \u201cone of the most powerful and aggressive agencies in the country\u201d.

Now changes in Chinese culture, more pressure from the US and an upcoming trade agreement are combining to undermine this contraband trade.</p> <p>The US banned the importation of dog and cat fur and skin, which <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/1308\">is punishable</a> by fines up to $10,000, as part of the Dog and Cat Protection Act of 2000. But distinguishing dog and cat leather from cow, sheep and pig leather is no easy matter, making it possible for unscrupulous manufacturers to pass off leather from dogs as leather from legal animals. A <a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RS22640.pdf\">report</a> by the Congressional Research Service shows that in 2014, the US imported $8.5bn in leather articles from China. It is unknown how much of each year\u2019s total might be dog or cat leather.</p> <p>The controversy over dog leather reached new heights in 2014 when an undercover investigator working for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) Asia discovered that dogs were being killed for leather production in China. According to Peta, which is calling on American consumers to forgo all leather goods in favor of vegan substitutes, employees at the facility said that 100-200 dogs were killed there a day and confirmed that the resulting leather was intended for export to and sale in the US market. The investigation shone a light on the underreported underbelly of the animal industry in China, which currently has no comprehensive animal welfare law.</p> <p>\u201cThe dog leather investigation we did, groups that are in the country with us really had no idea,\u201d said Jason Baker, Peta Asia\u2019s vice-president of international operations. \u201cWhile [the investigations] shock people internationally, they also shock people in China.\u201d</p> <p>Peta\u2019s footage of the dog slaughterhouse spurred congressional interest. In December 2015, Democratic congressman Alcee Hastings <a href=\"http://www.peta.org/blog/congress-member-alcee-l-hastings-seeks-inquiry-into-dog-leather-entering-u-s-marketplace/\">joined</a> colleagues Dina Titus and Steve Cohen in sending <a href=\"http://www.mediapeta.com/peta/PDF/121815CBPDog-LeatherLetter.pdf\">a letter</a> to the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) commissioner, R Gil Kerlikowske, calling for better regulation of leather importation to combat the use of dog leather.</p> <p>\u201cIn American culture, dogs are cherished pets and are considered a member of the family,\u201d the letter states. \u201cAccordingly, Americans would not want to hold their four-legged companion\u2019s leash with a dog-skin glove.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://alceehastings.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=100680\">Hastings</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hslf.org/news/press-releases/hslf-endorses-titus.html\">Titus</a> and <a href=\"https://cohen.house.gov/press-release/congressman-cohen-receives-perfect-rating-humane-society\">Cohen</a> all have strong track records when it comes to animal welfare issues, and Titus and Hastings, in interviews, both separately described the footage as \u201cdisturbing\u201d; the <a href=\"http://investigations.peta.org/china-dog-leather/\">graphic undercover footage</a> taken by the Peta Asia investigator showed dogs being bludgeoned before having their throats cut and their skin removed, sometimes, seemingly, while still alive. </p> <p>Despite the horrors of Peta\u2019s investigation, Peter Li, associate professor of east Asian politics at University of Houston-Downtown and a China policy specialist and consultant for Humane Society International, says dog fur facilities are few and far between in China. Li said that the dog leather trade is dependent on the dog meat trade; since killing dogs for meat is not illegal in China, the byproducts, including skin and fur, may be used for other purposes.</p> <p>\u201cDog leather or dog fur use in garments or other products are not that common in China. While there are a few sweatshops producing dog furs in different places, dog fur is largely a byproduct of dog meat trade,\u201d Li said in an email. \u201cWhen China outlaws dog eating and the dog meat trade, dog leather as a product shall be gone.\u201d</p> <p>The dog meat trade has become a focal point in the conversation around Chinese animal welfare, with local animal activists organizing to <a href=\"http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/animal-activists-notch-a-win-against-dog-traders/?_r=0\">rescue hundreds of dogs bound for the meat market</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/23/chinese-dog-eating-festival-backlash-yulin-animal-rights\">protesting against dog consumption</a>; Peta Asia has also focused its efforts on promoting veganism and vegetarianism in the country, and the consumption of dog meat is <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1537990/yulin-festival-dog-meat-sales-down-activists-take-fight-tradition\">believed to be declining</a> as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-china-blog-27952543\">pet ownership booms</a>. </p> <p>Though China, which is the world\u2019s largest <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/est/COMM_MARKETS_MONITORING/Hides_Skins/Documents/COMPENDIUM2013.pdf\">leather and fur producer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.spca.org.sg/documents/tenthingsfur.pdf\">exporter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wearefur.com/our-trade/about-the-fur-trade\">consumer</a>, lacks anti-animal abuse legislation, the animal welfare movement has been growing: China <a href=\"http://www.hsi.org/news/press_releases/2014/06/china-implements-rule-change-063014.html\">ended</a> mandatory animal testing of domestic cosmetics in 2014, local groups have worked to enforce spay and neuter programs, and Bloomberg News <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-22/dont-kidnap-my-dog-an-animal-rights-movement-starts-in-china\">reported</a> that in 2014 there were more than 100 animal welfare groups active in the country. Baker, of Peta, said that China was \u201cwhere Peta is shining the most, but it\u2019s also where the movement as a whole is shining\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cChina seems to be the center of animal protection movement in East Asia \u2026 The momentum in China is more robust than in Korea and Japan,\u201d Li said. But he added that government resistance to animal welfare legislation in China remains, due to economic concerns. \u201cThe concern of the Chinese government is that such a law could force a lot of the Chinese firms out of business,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese authorities remain obsessed with GDP growth and employment.\u201d</p> <p> While the dog meat and leather trades persist for now, the US\u2019s new interest in preventing the importation of dog leather could help curtail its production, and the terms of the new Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, of which China is not a member nation, may also have an impact. Although TPP is expected<a href=\"http://trade.gov/fta/tpp/industries/consumer.asp\"> to provide \u201csignificant new access\u201d</a> to certain leather markets, it also includes an<a href=\"https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/TPP-Chapter-Summary-Environment.pdf\"> environment chapter</a> which, though<a href=\"https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/TPP%20revised.pdf\"> criticized by some</a> for not doing enough to protect farm and livestock animals, nevertheless represents a significant step forward for animal protection and sustainability.</p> <p>\u201cI believe China would listen to concerns over dog leather export if the issue was raised by foreign governments including the US,\u201d Li said. \u201cAnimal welfare consideration in TPP should alert the mainland Chinese authorities that how we treat animals is as much as an international trade issue as a domestic issue. This will force the Chinese authorities to give up the old thinking that \u2018animal welfare is used as a trade tool against Chinese exports\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Likewise, Titus, who worked on last year\u2019s US congressional letter, believes that public advocacy in the US could be a powerful tool to help end the practice of the dog leather trade.<br></p> <p>\u201cPets are a part of people\u2019s lives here and animal protection is something that\u2019s a very emotional and serious issue. I think it should be an issue for animal lovers to kind of put pressure on the Customs [and Border Protection] commissioner [R Gil Kerlikowske] to be sure that they do everything they can to prevent this from happening, and I think there would be a public uproar about it,\u201d Titus said. \u201cIt is possible [that Americans are inadvertently using dog leather], and I think they\u2019d be horrified.\u201d<br></p>",

The investigation shone a light on the underreported underbelly of the animal industry in China, which currently has no comprehensive animal welfare law. \u201cThe dog leather investigation we did, groups that are in the country with us really had no idea,\u201d said Jason Baker, Peta Asia\u2019s vice-president of international operations. \u201cWhile [the investigations] shock people internationally, they also shock people in China.\u201d Peta\u2019s footage of the dog slaughterhouse spurred congressional interest. In December 2015, Democratic congressman Alcee Hastings joined colleagues Dina Titus and Steve Cohen in sending a letter to the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) commissioner, R Gil Kerlikowske, calling for better regulation of leather importation to combat the use of dog leather. \u201cIn American culture, dogs are cherished pets and are considered a member of the family,\u201d the letter states. \u201cAccordingly, Americans would not want to hold their four-legged companion\u2019s leash with a dog-skin glove.\u201d Hastings, Titus and Cohen all have strong track records when it comes to animal welfare issues, and Titus and Hastings, in interviews, both separately described the footage as \u201cdisturbing\u201d; the graphic undercover footage taken by the Peta Asia investigator showed dogs being bludgeoned before having their throats cut and their skin removed, sometimes, seemingly, while still alive. Despite the horrors of Peta\u2019s investigation, Peter Li, associate professor of east Asian politics at University of Houston-Downtown and a China policy specialist and consultant for Humane Society International, says dog fur facilities are few and far between in China. Li said that the dog leather trade is dependent on the dog meat trade; since killing dogs for meat is not illegal in China, the byproducts, including skin and fur, may be used for other purposes. \u201cDog leather or dog fur use in garments or other products are not that common in China. While there are a few sweatshops producing dog furs in different places, dog fur is largely a byproduct of dog meat trade,\u201d Li said in an email. \u201cWhen China outlaws dog eating and the dog meat trade, dog leather as a product shall be gone.\u201d The dog meat trade has become a focal point in the conversation around Chinese animal welfare, with local animal activists organizing to rescue hundreds of dogs bound for the meat market and protesting against dog consumption; Peta Asia has also focused its efforts on promoting veganism and vegetarianism in the country, and the consumption of dog meat is believed to be declining as pet ownership booms. Though China, which is the world\u2019s largest leather and fur producer, exporter and consumer, lacks anti-animal abuse legislation, the animal welfare movement has been growing: China ended mandatory animal testing of domestic cosmetics in 2014, local groups have worked to enforce spay and neuter programs, and Bloomberg News reported that in 2014 there were more than 100 animal welfare groups active in the country. Baker, of Peta, said that China was \u201cwhere Peta is shining the most, but it\u2019s also where the movement as a whole is shining\u201d. \u201cChina seems to be the center of animal protection movement in East Asia \u2026 The momentum in China is more robust than in Korea and Japan,\u201d Li said. But he added that government resistance to animal welfare legislation in China remains, due to economic concerns. \u201cThe concern of the Chinese government is that such a law could force a lot of the Chinese firms out of business,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese authorities remain obsessed with GDP growth and employment.\u201d While the dog meat and leather trades persist for now, the US\u2019s new interest in preventing the importation of dog leather could help curtail its production, and the terms of the new Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, of which China is not a member nation, may also have an impact. Although TPP is expected to provide \u201csignificant new access\u201d to certain leather markets, it also includes an environment chapter which, though criticized by some for not doing enough to protect farm and livestock animals, nevertheless represents a significant step forward for animal protection and sustainability. \u201cI believe China would listen to concerns over dog leather export if the issue was raised by foreign governments including the US,\u201d Li said. \u201cAnimal welfare consideration in TPP should alert the mainland Chinese authorities that how we treat animals is as much as an international trade issue as a domestic issue. This will force the Chinese authorities to give up the old thinking that \u2018animal welfare is used as a trade tool against Chinese exports\u2019.\u201d Likewise, Titus, who worked on last year\u2019s US congressional letter, believes that public advocacy in the US could be a powerful tool to help end the practice of the dog leather trade. \u201cPets are a part of people\u2019s lives here and animal protection is something that\u2019s a very emotional and serious issue. I think it should be an issue for animal lovers to kind of put pressure on the Customs [and Border Protection] commissioner [R Gil Kerlikowske] to be sure that they do everything they can to prevent this from happening, and I think there would be a public uproar about it,\u201d Titus said. \u201cIt is possible [that Americans are inadvertently using dog leather], and I think they\u2019d be horrified.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Movies fall into two categories. There are arthouse movies, films full of hidden delights and subtlety that appeal to the initiated only. And there are blockbusters, no-nonsense cinematic experiences designed to wow the audience with a straightforward storyline and special effects. During his first three years as governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney has been like the director of a film in which there is plenty of talk but not much else. This week he needs to channel his inner George Lucas. The City does not want C\u00e9line and Julie Go Boating; it wants Star Wars. Carney\u2019s latest production will be unveiled to the public on Thursday, six weeks to the day since the UK voted to leave the European Union. All the signs are that Brexit has led to a complete rewrite of the Bank of England\u2019s script. Had the referendum gone the other way, the Old Lady would have been preparing the ground for interest rate increases over the next few months. Now its job is to shore up growth and confidence in an all-action performance. Anticipation ahead of a meeting of the monetary policy committee (MPC) has rarely been higher. Threadneedle Street cannot afford to do what the Bank of Japan did on Friday and leave the markets underwhelmed. A cut in the official cost of borrowing is a nailed-on certainty. For many years it had been assumed that Bank rate could go no lower than 0.5%, where it has been pegged since the economy was deep in recession in early 2009. Brexit has put paid to that notion. Expect rates to be cut to 0.25%. That, though, is unlikely to be the end of things. The Bank has made it clear that it is considering a \u201cpackage\u201d of measures, and Andy Haldane, its chief economist, has talked of the need for a \u201csledgehammer\u201d. A 0.25-point cut in interest rates will not live up to the advance billing. The Bank has a range of other options. It could cut rates even further, to 0.1%. It could use forward guidance to send out a message that interest rates will remain at ultra-low levels for a considerable period to come. It could restart quantitative easing (QE), adding to the \u00a3375bn of government bonds it bought between 2009 and 2012. It could widen the QE programme to include corporate bonds. It could expand its Funding for Lending programme, which led to a marked pick-up in activity when first introduced in the summer of 2012. Or it could come up with some new initiative that nobody is expecting: a twist in the tale that takes the audience by surprise. The Bank has shown in the past that it can make a bold statement. When the economy was collapsing in late 2008, the MPC didn\u2019t tinker around with half-point rate cuts: it slashed them from 4.5% to 3% and continued hacking away until borrowing costs stood at a historic low of 0.5%. Business surveys released since Brexit have nearly all been pretty downbeat but most were conducted in the confused days immediately after the referendum when companies were dumbstruck by the result. There is a possibility that sentiment will have improved as a result of the calmer conditions in the financial markets and the early arrival in Downing Street of Theresa May. But why take the risk? In the current circumstances, the Bank\u2019s job is to demonstrate that it won\u2019t allow the economy to slide into recession through official neglect. A show of shock and awe can buy some time while the government fleshes out its post-Brexit plan. If there is an argument for holding back, it is that more stimulus will be required in the months to come. Thursday will not be the end of the story. As with all the best blockbusters, there will be a sequel. By any measure, going ahead with Hinkley would be madness As the UK government readies itself to \u201cconsider carefully all the component parts\u201d of the \u00a318bn Hinkley Point project, it should start with first principles. The nuclear power station, as currently financed, is a threat to the UK\u2019s national energy security. It would be absurdly expensive for UK consumers. And the technology hasn\u2019t been shown to work. Any of those reasons ought to be enough to condemn Hinkley to the bin, to be remembered only as a prize example of successive governments\u2019 craven indulgence of the nuclear lobby. Taken together, they make the case overwhelming: Hinkley is not the answer to the UK\u2019s looming energy crisis. On the national security point, Theresa May should start by reading an excellent analysis by Nick Timothy, her joint chief of staff, published last October. The government is \u201cselling our national security to China\u201d, argued Timothy, noting the alarm of the security services that a Chinese state-backed firm could take a one-third stake in Hinkley as a precursor to building its own nuclear reactor in Bradwell in Essex. Others make the financial point that the former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s grovel for Chinese cash wasn\u2019t merely embarrassing but also baffling. The UK government can currently borrow at 0.7% for 10 years. Why not take advantage of that, rather than play off-balance-sheet games to the benefit of Beijing? The costs of Hinkley are now well known. The UK insulated itself from cost overruns in the construction phase by granting EDF a licence to print money for 35 years. The price of oil, taken as proxy for the cost of wholesale energy, would have to average $150 a barrel, compared with $42 currently, for three decades for Hinkley to represent good value. Yes, nuclear-generated electricity is reliable. But if that is what we want, build smaller and cheaper modular reactors. In any case, \u201creliable\u201d is not a good description of EDF. Its attempts in Finland and Normandy to build Hinkley-style European pressurised reactors (EPRs) are years behind schedule. If you want reliable energy, do not order an EPR from EDF. May, untainted by Osborne\u2019s obsession with Hinkley, has a chance to free the UK from the madness. She must take it. One signature from Sir Philip is all that is required Last week hundreds of BHS staff picked up their final paycheques and there were multiple pictures of battered department stores closing their doors for the last time. They were the starkest possible contrast to the long-lens shots of Sir Philip Green lounging around the Aegean on his new \u00a3100m yacht, Lionheart. Green wasn\u2019t in total relaxation mode. He was busy firing off legal letters to Dominic Chappell, the man who shepherded BHS into administration just a year after buying it from Green for \u00a31, and to Frank Field, the MP who compared Green to the former Mirror publisher and pensions thief Robert Maxwell. Green\u2019s clearly mad as hell about taking the rap for the demise of BHS. He has promised to \u201csort\u201d the \u00a3571m pension scheme hole, and the mounting controversy \u2013 over his billions, his boat and his knighthood while BHS staff face pension cuts \u2013 would recede if he did exactly that. A single cheque is all that is required \u2026",

Threadneedle Street cannot afford to do what the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/bank-of-japan-blames-brexit-as-it-unleashes-more-monetary-stimulus\" title=\"\">Bank of Japan</a> did on Friday and leave the markets underwhelmed.</p> <p>A cut in the official cost of borrowing is a nailed-on certainty. For many years it had been assumed that Bank rate could go no lower than 0.5%, where it has been pegged since the economy was deep in recession in early 2009. Brexit has put paid to that notion. Expect rates to be cut to 0.25%.</p> <p>That, though, is unlikely to be the end of things. The Bank has made it clear that it is considering a \u201cpackage\u201d of measures, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/15/bank-of-england-chief-economist-calls-for-big-post-brexit-stimulus\" title=\"\">Andy Haldane</a>, its chief economist, has talked of the need for a \u201csledgehammer\u201d. A 0.25-point cut in interest rates will not live up to the advance billing.</p> <p>The Bank has a range of other options. It could cut rates even further, to 0.1%. It could use forward guidance to send out a message that interest rates will remain at ultra-low levels for a considerable period to come. It could restart quantitative easing (QE), adding to the \u00a3375bn of government bonds it bought between 2009 and 2012. It could widen the QE programme to include corporate bonds. It could expand its Funding for Lending programme, which led to a marked pick-up in activity when first introduced in the summer of 2012. Or it could come up with some new initiative that nobody is expecting: a twist in the tale that takes the audience by surprise.</p> <p>The Bank has shown in the past that it can make a bold statement. When the economy was collapsing in late 2008, the MPC didn\u2019t tinker around with half-point rate cuts: it slashed them from 4.5% to 3% and continued hacking away until borrowing costs stood at a historic low of 0.5%.</p> <p>Business surveys released since Brexit have nearly all been pretty downbeat but most were conducted in the confused days immediately after the referendum when companies were dumbstruck by the result. There is a possibility that sentiment will have improved as a result of the calmer conditions in the financial markets and the early arrival in Downing Street of Theresa May.</p> <p>But why take the risk? In the current circumstances, the Bank\u2019s job is to demonstrate that it won\u2019t allow the economy to slide into recession through official neglect. A show of shock and awe can buy some time while the government fleshes out its post-Brexit plan.</p> <p>If there is an argument for holding back, it is that more stimulus will be required in the months to come. Thursday will not be the end of the story. As with all the best blockbusters, there will be a sequel.</p> <h2>By any measure, going ahead with Hinkley would be madness</h2> <p>As the UK government readies itself to \u201cconsider carefully all the component parts\u201d of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\" title=\"\">\u00a318bn Hinkley Point project</a>, it should start with first principles. The nuclear power station, as currently financed, is a threat to the UK\u2019s national energy security. It would be absurdly expensive for UK consumers. And the technology hasn\u2019t been shown to work.</p> <p>Any of those reasons ought to be enough to condemn Hinkley to the bin, to be remembered only as a prize example of successive governments\u2019 craven indulgence of the nuclear lobby. Taken together, they make the case overwhelming: Hinkley is not the answer to the UK\u2019s looming energy crisis.</p> <p>On the national security point, Theresa May should start by reading an excellent analysis by Nick Timothy, her joint chief of staff, published last October. The government is <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/10/nick-timothy-the-government-is-selling-our-national-security-to-china.html\" title=\"\">\u201cselling our national security to China\u201d</a>, argued Timothy, noting the alarm of the security services that a Chinese state-backed firm could take a one-third stake in Hinkley as a precursor to building its own nuclear reactor in Bradwell in Essex.</p> <p>Others make the financial point that the former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s grovel for Chinese cash wasn\u2019t merely embarrassing but also baffling. The UK government can currently borrow at 0.7% for 10 years. Why not take advantage of that, rather than play off-balance-sheet games to the benefit of Beijing?</p> <p>The costs of Hinkley are now well known. The UK insulated itself from cost overruns in the construction phase by granting EDF a licence to print money for 35 years. The price of oil, taken as proxy for the cost of wholesale energy, would have to average $150 a barrel, compared with $42 currently, for three decades for Hinkley to represent good value. Yes, nuclear-generated electricity is reliable. But if that is what we want, build smaller and cheaper modular reactors.</p> <p>In any case, \u201creliable\u201d is not a good description of EDF. Its attempts in Finland and Normandy to build Hinkley-style European pressurised reactors (EPRs) are years behind schedule. If you want reliable energy, do not order an EPR from EDF.</p> <p>May, untainted by Osborne\u2019s obsession with Hinkley, has a chance to free the UK from the madness. She must take it.</p> <h2>One signature from Sir Philip is all that is required</h2> <p>Last week hundreds of BHS staff picked up their final paycheques and there were multiple pictures of battered department stores <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/27/bhs-frank-field-calls-on-sfo-to-launch-formal-inquiry-into-demise-philip-green-dominic-chappell\" title=\"\">closing their doors</a> for the last time. They were the starkest possible contrast to the long-lens shots of Sir Philip Green lounging around the Aegean on his new \u00a3100m yacht, Lionheart.</p> <p>Green wasn\u2019t in total relaxation mode. He was busy firing off legal letters to Dominic Chappell, the man who shepherded BHS into administration just a year after buying it from Green for \u00a31, and to Frank Field, the MP who compared Green to the former <em>Mirror</em> publisher and pensions thief Robert Maxwell. Green\u2019s clearly mad as hell about taking the rap for the demise of BHS. He has promised to \u201csort\u201d the \u00a3571m pension scheme hole, and the mounting controversy \u2013 over his billions, his boat and his knighthood while BHS staff face pension cuts \u2013 would recede if he did exactly that. A single cheque is all that is required \u2026</p>",

      "bodyText": "During the EU referendum debate almost the whole global economic and financial establishment lined up to warn of the consequences of Brexit, and yet 52% of the country ignored them. For many Remain voters it is a clear sign of the shift into an era of post-truth politics. While economists developed rigorous, evidence-based arguments, Leave campaigners slandered experts and appeared to pluck numbers out of the air. Yet they won. Post-truth politics is indeed a scary prospect but to avoid such a future we cannot simply blame \u201cpopulist politicians\u201d or \u201cill-informed voters\u201d. We must understand the referendum in its wider context; economists must realise that they are both part of the problem and a necessary part of the solution. We are living in an econocracy. Such a society seems like a democracy, with political parties and elections, but political goals are expressed in terms of their effect on \u201cthe economy\u201d, and economic policymaking is viewed as a technical, not a political, activity. Areas of political life are increasingly delegated to experts, whether at the Bank of England, the government\u2019s behavioural insights team, the Competition Commission or the Treasury. As members of Rethinking Economics, an international student movement seeking to reform the discipline of economics, we are campaigning for a more pluralist, critical and participatory approach. We conduct workshops in schools, run evening crash courses for adults, and this year launched Economy, a website providing accessible economic analysis of current affairs and a platform for lively public debate. We want economists and citizens to join us in our mission to democratise economics. That\u2019s because the language of economics has become the language of government, and as the experts on \u201cthe economy\u201d, economists have secured a position of prestige and authority. Their rise has gone hand in hand with the increasing importance over the 20th century and beyond of the idea of the economy in political and social life. This idea in its modern use took hold only in the 1950s but today GDP growth is one of the central indicators of success for governments, and it is unheard of for a political party to win a general election without being viewed as competent on the economy. We have also seen the economisation of daily life, so that parts of society as diverse as the arts and healthcare now justify their value in terms of their contribution to the economy. But in this process economists have largely ignored citizens and failed to consider their right to participate in discussion and decision-making. In the wake of the referendum, Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Britain\u2019s most authoritative economic thinktank, lamented that economists had \u201cfailed to communicate basic economic concepts to politicians, journalists and businesspeople, never mind the public\u201d. Johnson\u2019s soul-searching highlights a broader feeling within the economics profession that it has been ignored and diminished by the result of the EU referendum. The Leave campaign explicitly attempted to devalue economic expertise, including Michael Gove\u2019s now infamous claim that \u201cpeople in this country have had enough of experts\u201d. This is an effective strategy in an econocracy because it exploits the fact that people feel cut off from, and unrepresented by, economics. Our view is that experts are essential in the modern world but that, in the case of economics, they have in many ways overreached themselves, undermining democracy and fuelling popular discontent in the process. In polling we did with YouGov, just under half of respondents reported talking about economics only once a month or less. Only 12% felt that politicians and the media talked about economics in an accessible way. This isn\u2019t to say that economic issues weren\u2019t an important part of the debate. After all, social class and location were key determinants in the outcome of the vote, with Leave voters much more likely to have a lower income and be from poorer areas. What is striking is how unlikely most of those people are to use the language of economics to describe their views. Instead nationalism and immigration have filled the vacuum left by the absence of a public language and spaces in which people could air their economic grievances. Nationalist and anti-immigration arguments had more resonance with many people\u2019s lived experience of the economy than those provided by economics. The referendum illustrates clearly a nation divided between a minority who feel they own the language of economics and those who don\u2019t. Unless economists find a way to give people a voice to engage in debate, economics risks becoming completely disregarded as irrelevant or propaganda. Economists\u2019 tools and theories fail to describe the lives of many people in the UK. It is only through sustained and two-way public engagement that economists can regain the trust of the public and prevent the scary drift towards a world of post-truth politics. To those who are saying that the vote for Brexit showed we shouldn\u2019t let people make these decisions, we say that we need more democracy, not less. At Rethinking Economics we are trying to be the change we want to see, and we call on economists and citizens to join us in our mission to democratise economics.
