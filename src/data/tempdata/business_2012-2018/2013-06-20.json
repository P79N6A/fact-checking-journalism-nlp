    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stock markets worldwide plummeted on Thursday, after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, rattled investors by signalling an end to America's drastic recession-busting policy of quantitative easing. Share prices across the globe have surged over the past year, helped by an unprecedented injection of cheap money, with the Fed buying up $85bn (\u00a355bn) worth of bonds every month, and the Bank of Japan pledging \"shock and awe\" QE to revive a stagnant national economy. But when Bernanke laid out a timetable on Wednesday night for cutting off the Fed's bond purchases by mid-2014, his words prompted a violent sell-off, which began in New York after European markets were closed, and ricocheted around the world on Thursday, from Tokyo to Istanbul and Oslo to Jakarta. In London, the 2.98% decline in the FTSE 100 index was the steepest since September 2011. Elsewhere in Europe, shares suffered their biggest one-day fall in 19 months, with Spain's Ibex losing 2.9%, and the German, French and Italian markets all down by more than 3%. The slide on Wall Street resumed when US markets reopened on Thursday. After heavy selling throughout the day the Dow Jones closed down 2.3%. \"We've had a market that for some years has been addicted to stimulus, and it's taken a brave man to say it has to end somewhere,\" said Neil Mellor, of BNY Mellon. He added that the true test of whether the US economy was strong enough to cope without QE would come when the prop of cheap money had been removed. \"We don't know if there's a credible recovery there; we're peeling back the plaster.\" Bond prices also fell worldwide, a trend that will push up borrowing costs for governments and consumers if it is sustained. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's outspoken director for financial stability, warned last week that through QE, policymakers had deliberately inflated \"the biggest bond bubble in history\". He added that a \"disorderly reversion in the yields of government bonds globally\" was the greatest risk to financial stability. The yield \u2013 or interest rate \u2013 on British government 10-year bonds jumped to 2.3%, the highest level for more than a year, although it remains low in historical terms. Growing fears of problems in China's banking sector, as the authorities try to manage the transition from rampant, export-led growth to a more sustainable, consumer-led economic model, also helped stoke investors' alarm. Those concerns sent the price of many commodities \u2013 dependent on Chinese demand \u2013 deep into the red. The price of gold plummeted more than 6% on the day, falling through $1,290 an ounce, down 30% from its peak. Investors who feared that QE would unleash a wave of inflation have taken refuge in the safe haven of the precious metal over the past two years. Silver fell even further, down more than 8% on the day. The cost of a barrel of oil also dropped, by almost $4. Commodity firms were among the biggest fallers on the FTSE, with BHP Billiton down by 4.6%, and mining and trading company Glencore Xstrata down by 4.75%. Bernanke, who looks likely to leave his job at the end of his term next January, was careful to stress that bond purchases would be halted only if the economy continued to improve. But investors nevertheless took his statement as a strong signal that the days of cheap money are coming to an end. \"The markets are extrapolating,\" said Russell Jones, of Llewellyn Consulting. \"The danger for policymakers is that if it continues, and you get a big interest rate shock through the bond markets, and a big equity market shock, that in itself slows the economy down. There comes a time when this sort of reaction becomes self-defeating. We're not there yet, but if this goes on, it's a risk.\" With bond yields rising and currencies falling across scores of emerging markets, there is also a risk that vulnerable countries, heavily dependent on flows of \"hot money\" from foreign investors, will be plunged into crisis. In Turkey, where a wave of recent protests has highlighted the political risks for investors, shares closed more than 21% lower than their high last month.",

      "body": "<p>On Monday, in Question Time, Wayne Swan <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F5b6d8876-4831-481f-8b5b-85bb0fbe651f%2F0120%22\">called</a> Joe Hockey a \u201cbonehead\u201d for describing the current employment situation as mediocre.</p> <p>So is it a bonehead statement, or is Australia\u2019s employment level mediocre? Incidentally, the term \"bonehead\u201d was first used in Parliament in 1986 by <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1986-04-15%2F0015%22\">John Dawkins to Ian Sinclair.</a></p> <p>Since 1978 Australia\u2019s unemployment rate has averaged 7.0%, with a median rate of 6.6% (ie half of the time it has been above that rate and the other half below it). So the current rate of 5.5% seems rather better than mediocre.</p> <p>However, in the past 10 years the unemployment rate has averaged 5.1%, so perhaps Joe Hockey has a point. But compared to other nations which were on par with us during that period, we are doing OK:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9cc79226-2d2f-41b1-a05b-0dc706914736\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/19/1371633163739/cf33cb61-24c9-43ca-9d32-103aa68e46a4-460x264.jpeg\" alt=\"Unemployment rate: Australia, UK, US\" width=\"460\" height=\"264\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unemployment rate: Australia, UK, US Photograph: /ABS, BLS, ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Looking at the unemployment rate isn\u2019t the only way to judge these things, and when trying to decide how much capacity there is in the labour market, it\u2019s better to look a bit deeper \u2013 by including people who might be \u201chidden\u201d by the unemployment rate.</p> <p>Fortunately, if you do want to look deeper, the <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mediareleasesbyCatalogue/46DFE12FCDB783D9CA256B740082AA6C?Opendocument\">ABS provide you with another figure</a> \u2013 one which they only measure every quarter \u2013 that of under-employed workers. This measure counts part-time workers who wish to work more hours, and full-time workers who worked less than 35 hours per week (the standard measure of a full-time job).</p> <p>The latest figure, released last week, has the current underemployment rate at 7.3%. This figure, combined with the unemployment rate, gives us the \u201cunderutilized rate\u201d of 12.8% (I should warn you at this point there\u2019s going to be a lot of use of \u201cunderemployment\u201d, \u201cunemployment\u201d and \u201cunderutilisation\u201d).</p> <p>So what is the real figure? First, let\u2019s not be tricked into thinking the unemployment rate is a fudge used by politicians because it\u2019s the lowest. It\u2019s a standard measure used across the world. It\u2019s also important to remember that underemployment is only a recent concern. Prior to the 1990s recession, as I noted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/grogonomics/2013/jun/17/australia-s-flexibility-keeps-it-strong\">earlier this week</a>, an overwhelming majority of men worked full-time. During the 1980s the underemployment rate rarely went above 4%, whereas the actual unemployment rate was rarely below 6%.</p> <p>The growth of part-time work and a greater percentage of women working has made underemployment an issue. And just in case you think women are content with their employment levels, the underemployment rate for women is 9.3% compared to that of men of 5.6%.</p> <p>So is this a mediocre amount of underemployment?</p> <p>Well the level of underutilisation in the labour market caused by underemployment has actually fallen recently. But this is more because unemployment has risen rather than people suddenly being able to find more hours. Indeed, the underemployment and unemployment rates have moved pretty much in sync for the past 10 years.</p> <p>So what about underutilisation? Is 12.8% mediocre, and if so how low should it be?</p> <p>To determine this we need to think about \u201cfull employment\u201d.</p> <p>When trying to find the rate of \u201cfull employment\u201d economists like to use the \u201c<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIRU\">non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment</a>\u201d. That is, they\u2019re looking for the lowest unemployment rate which doesn\u2019t cause inflation to rise.</p> <p>Importantly, this figure is not set in stone and can shift up and down. In the 1980s it was thought to be around 6%, and during the past decade we saw pretty clear evidence that it shifted to around 5%.</p> <p>But to make sure we don\u2019t miss out on the underemployed workers let\u2019s see if we can find \u201cfull utilisation\u201d instead.</p> <p>The way to do this is to chart a version of the \u201c<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve\">Phillips curve</a>\u201d by comparing the underutilisation rate with inflation:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3de81421-db0a-469b-ae74-eecd9f0c4594\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/19/1371633227953/2e86baf7-a0fe-437a-a0c0-599543e0311e-460x264.jpeg\" alt=\"Inflation and underutilization rate\" width=\"460\" height=\"264\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inflation and underutilization rate Photograph: /ABS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From around May 2002 to May 2007 the underutilisation rate fell without causing inflation to rise. But once the underutilisation rate went below 10.7%, inflation began to increase.</p> <p>Then the GFC hit, inflation fell and underutilisation rose. By the middle of 2009 we were back where we were in 2002 and, rather nicely, we started back on the same path.</p> <p>But since February 2011 things have got a bit jumbled. And we now find ourselves at a lower level of inflation than we would expect given our underutilisation rate.</p> <p>So is our current situation mediocre? Well, it is certainly below the level of full utilisation. Compared to 2007 there\u2019s 2% of the labour force (about 250,000 people) either not working, or not working enough - before a rise in inflation.</p> <p>Given the current weak state of the world economy, and given our current level of inflation is expected to rise because of our falling exchange rate, the more important question is whether the level of full utilisation of May 2007 has shifted.</p> <p>After 10 years are we about to move off this nice loop and onto a different path?</p> <p>And is it a path to economic mediocrity or superiority?</p>",

The growth of part-time work and a greater percentage of women working has made underemployment an issue. And just in case you think women are content with their employment levels, the underemployment rate for women is 9.3% compared to that of men of 5.6%. So is this a mediocre amount of underemployment? Well the level of underutilisation in the labour market caused by underemployment has actually fallen recently. But this is more because unemployment has risen rather than people suddenly being able to find more hours. Indeed, the underemployment and unemployment rates have moved pretty much in sync for the past 10 years. So what about underutilisation? Is 12.8% mediocre, and if so how low should it be? To determine this we need to think about \u201cfull employment\u201d. When trying to find the rate of \u201cfull employment\u201d economists like to use the \u201cnon-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment\u201d. That is, they\u2019re looking for the lowest unemployment rate which doesn\u2019t cause inflation to rise. Importantly, this figure is not set in stone and can shift up and down. In the 1980s it was thought to be around 6%, and during the past decade we saw pretty clear evidence that it shifted to around 5%. But to make sure we don\u2019t miss out on the underemployed workers let\u2019s see if we can find \u201cfull utilisation\u201d instead. The way to do this is to chart a version of the \u201cPhillips curve\u201d by comparing the underutilisation rate with inflation: From around May 2002 to May 2007 the underutilisation rate fell without causing inflation to rise. But once the underutilisation rate went below 10.7%, inflation began to increase. Then the GFC hit, inflation fell and underutilisation rose. By the middle of 2009 we were back where we were in 2002 and, rather nicely, we started back on the same path. But since February 2011 things have got a bit jumbled. And we now find ourselves at a lower level of inflation than we would expect given our underutilisation rate. So is our current situation mediocre? Well, it is certainly below the level of full utilisation. Compared to 2007 there\u2019s 2% of the labour force (about 250,000 people) either not working, or not working enough - before a rise in inflation. Given the current weak state of the world economy, and given our current level of inflation is expected to rise because of our falling exchange rate, the more important question is whether the level of full utilisation of May 2007 has shifted. After 10 years are we about to move off this nice loop and onto a different path? And is it a path to economic mediocrity or superiority?",

Analysts said Pixmania lost \u00a331m and the retailer's southern European stores lost \u00a324m. Dixons ended the year with \u00a342.1m of net cash, having started it with \u00a3104m of net debt.

      "bodyText": "Barclays, Co-operative Bank, Nationwide and the two bailed-out banks Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group have been ordered to plug a \u00a327bn capital shortfall identified by the new banking regulator \u2013 sparking concerns about the impact the financial repairs would have on their ability to lend. The Prudential Regulation Authority, part of the Bank of England, also surprised the City by instructing Barclays and Nationwide to reduce the risks they take after focusing on a new measure of the risks being taken, called the leverage ratio. Both banks have, according to the PRA, a leverage ratio which is below an internationally agreed standard of 3% - which allows banks to have assets worth 33 times their capital - which must be hit by 2019. The two have been given until the end of the month to come up with a plan to reduce their leverage although the PRA did not say when the target must be hit. This focus on the leverage ratio was unexpected and could result in both of the firms \u2013 which have been actively lending to businesses and households \u2013 needing to find extra capital in addition to the shortfalls already identified. Analysts at Credit Suisse estimated that Barclays might need an extra \u00a32.4bn or may have to cut back its assets by \u00a381bn. However, there were also suggestions that the requirement could be even larger \u2013 as much as \u00a37bn \u2013 if action was needed swiftly. Barclays has a plan to hit the ratio by 2015. Of the \u00a327.1bn capital shortfall identified by the PRA, some \u00a313.7bn of capital had already been found by the end of last year. But even as chancellor George Osborne fired the starting gun on a sell-off the taxpayers' 39% stake in Lloyds, the PRA said the bailed out bank had needed \u00a38.6bn of additional capital and still had some \u00a37bn to find. It will do so by selling off assets and reducing risks. The biggest hole was at RBS, the 81% government-owned bank which Osborne said on Wednesday said he could yet split intotwo \u2013 good and bad \u2013 banks. But the \u00a313.6bn shortfall identified at RBS has now fallen to \u00a33.2bn, a \u00a33bn shortfall at Barclays has been reduced to \u00a31.7bn and Co-op said it will fill its \u00a31.5bn hole by listing shares on the stock market. Nationwide building society had a \u00a3400m shortfall which has filled but the mutual now has to tackle the implications of the leverage ratio measure. Nationwide, which has a leverage ratio of 2.1%, described it as \"a less sophisticated measure which ignores the quality of assets or the business model\". It is the first time the City regulator has published such detailed information about the shortfalls but the move was criticised for potentially restricting lending and hindering future economic growth after the chancellor said in his Mansion House speech that the economy had \"left intensive care\". Kevin Burrowes, UK financial services leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: \"While more transparency is welcome, it is debatable whether this disclosure is supportive of pushing economic growth or facilitates more bank lending.\" In total eight financial firms were assessed \u2013 HSBC, the UK arm of Santander and Standard Chartered were given the all clear \u2013 to ensure they had taken large enough provisions for: compensating customers for mis-selling payment protection and interest rate swaps; further losses on loans after offering forbearance to customers by tweaking borrowing terms; and the way they value risks on their balance sheets. The PRA said firms had been asked to produce plans to \"address shortfalls that do not reduce lending to the real economy\".",

On Tuesday of this week the SFO announced that Hayes had been charged with eight counts of conspiracy to defraud in setting Libor prices but did not disclose any further details before his appearance in court on Thursday. The SFO's investigation is ongoing. So far international regulators have made announcements about fines for three banks: Barclays which was fined \u00a3290m a year ago; RBS which was fined \u00a3390m in February; and the Swiss bank UBS which was fined \u00a3940m in December. Of the firms named in court on Thursday, and said to have employed Hayes' co-conspirators, all either declined to comment or re-iterated past comments confirming they were helping the authorities with their inquiries. Tullett Prebon maintained it still had no evidence suggesting its brokers acted improperly or are under criminal or regulatory investigation in relation to Libor. The inter-deal broker privately claims to have conducted a thorough review and found no reason to suspend anyone. The firm's chief executive Terry Smith has been one of the most outspoken advocates of criminal prosecutions for anyone found to have attempted to fix Libor rates. In June last year, he said on his blog: \"For the record, my view [is] that the banks do not have any integrity left and that criminal proceedings should be instituted against those who had manipulated Libor.\" The Financial Conduct Authority, which has replaced the Financial Services Authority, has said it is continuing to investigate four other financial firms but has not yet identified them. When the UBS fine was announced in December Hayes, a British national, was charged by the US authorities with conspiracy, wire fraud and an anti-trust violation. He was one of the three individuals arrested by the SFO in December as part of its investigation into Libor-rigging, which was was launched in the wake of the Barclays fine announcement last June.

      "bodyText": "Here's our latet news story about the events in the market today, by my colleague Heather Stewart: Violent sell-off in world markets after Federal Reserve signals end to QE Stock markets worldwide plummeted on Thursday, after Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke rattled investors by signalling an end to America's drastic recession-busting policy of quantitative easing. Share prices across the globe have surged over the past year, helped by an unprecedented injection of cheap money, with the Fed buying up $85bn (\u00a355bn)-worth of bonds every month, and the Bank of Japan pledging \"shock and awe\" QE to revive a stagnant national economy. But when Bernanke laid out a timetable on Wednesday night for cutting off the Fed's bond purchases by mid-2014, his words sparked a violent sell-off, which began in New York after European markets were closed, and ricocheted around the world on Thursday, from Tokyo to Istanbul and Oslo to Jakarta. In London, the 2.98% decline in the FTSE 100 index was the steepest since September 2011. Elsewhere in Europe shares suffered their biggest one day fall in 19 months, with Spain's IBEX losing 2.9%, and the German, French and Italian markets all down by more than 3%. The Brazilian stock market fell by more than 3%, while the real hit a four-year low against the dollar. The slide on Wall Street resumed when US markets reopened on Thursday. By lunchtime, every share in the Dow Jones industrial average index had fallen. And that's where we'll leave thing for the day. Thanks for reading, and goodnight. Wall Street remains deep in the red this aftenoon, with the Dow Jones hovering around a 200-point loss. Here's the latest prices from New York (top two entries), along with the closing prices for the key European and Asian markets: British goverment debt suffered its biggest one-day fall this year, as gilts followed the rest of the sovereign debt market by falling as investors scrambled for the safety of the dollar. The yield on 10-year gilts remains around 2.3% tonight, sharply higher than yesterday's 2.13%. That means it will cost the UK government more to issue new debt. Bond yields (which rise when the price of the debt fall) have been creeping steadily higher since the start of May as bond traders anticipated the winding-down of the Federal Reserve's stimulus plan. This graph shows how the FTSE 100 fell sharply at the start of trading, and then plumbed further depths though the afternoon session: Mining stocks were the biggest fallers in London, due to the drop in the commodities prices (gold is still its lowest since September 2010, below $1,300 per ounce). Here's the biggest fallers today: Brenda Kelly, senior market strategist at IG, fears that Bernanke has \"fired the starting pistol\" on a wave of selling that might last through the summer, adding: Today\u2019s market action was like a day out at Alton Towers only with more spills than thrills and a plethora of nauseating effects. It's official - the FTSE 100 index has closed down 189 points, or nearly 3%, in its biggest percentage fall since September 2011. That means that \u00a348bn has been wiped off the value of the 100 companies that make up the Footsie. Details and graphs to follow..... Big, big losses on the main continental exchanges, as European shares suffered their biggest one day fall in 19 months. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 2.9% -- with every index sharing the fall. Spain's IBEX has finished 2.9% down, Italy FTSE MIB lost 3.1%, Germany's DAX lost 3% and France's fell 3.3%. That's it.... stock market trading is over in Europe for the day. In a few minutes we'll know the full damage on the FTSE 10 (once the closing auction has taken place) Over in Istanbul, another day of heavy losses ended with the benchmark ISE 100 index down more than 21% compared with its recent high last month. Turkish shares had already fallen steadily since anti-government protests began in the capital, before today's Bernanke-inspired volatility. With less than 30 minutes to go, Europe's stock markets are sliding even deeper into the red. In London, the FTSE 100 has now shed more than 3% and is around 200 points lower at 6149. Meanwhile, the US dollar continues to strengthen against everything in sight, as investors sell bonds and stocks in favour of the safely of cash. And nothing's as safe on these occasions as the greenback. That's pushed the euro down almost 1% to $1.317 and the yen to \u00a598 against the US dollar, from \u00a596.5 yesterday. Surprisingly, the Norwegian Krone is the biggest loser, tumbling around 4%. That was prompted by the Norwegian central bank announcing that it would not raise interest rates until late 2014, rather than next spring. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The Norwegian krone has been absolutely caned after the central bank governor indicated that there was room for rates to remain at their current level, \u201cor somewhat lower\u201d, which caught a lot of people by surprise. Brazil is suffering from the global drubbing. Its benchmark index tumbled by over 3%, and the Brazilian Real has lost another 2% to a four-year low, despite the country's central bank intervening again in an attempt to strengthen it. Glauber Romano, a trader at the Intercam brokerage in Sao Paulo, told Reuters that investors were spooked: Markets are going through a panic moment. The central bank, within its possibilities, is doing its job (to calm down investors) but the sentiment is pretty bad. Two pieces of encouraging economic data have been released \u2013 but they've not brought any relief to the stock markets 1) Consumer confidence in the eurozone rose sharply in June to a 22-month high, according to data released by the European Commission (here's the full report) 2) The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's monthly survey of business confidence in America has jumped back into positive territory, showing US firms are more optimistic about business conditions, with new orders rising. That sounds encouraging....but shares have actually fallen further. The theory goes that if central bankers really are working off the data, this will encourage an end to ultra-loose monetary policy Further evidence that commodities prices are being hit \u2013 the cost of a barrel of Brent crude oil has dropped by almost $3 to $103.07. Oil's a pretty decent measure of economic growth predictions, and today's decline is being blamed on this morning's poor Chinese factory data (see 8.38am). Every share in the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen, as the selloff that began when the Federal Reserve announces its monthly monetary policy decision comes full circle. Industrial machinery giant Caterpillar is the biggest faller on a list of worst performers dominated by some of the most famous companies in the world: It's not a full-blown rout, though -- partly because traders already got their chance to sell shares last night (Bernanke started speaking at 2.30pm New York time, and Wall Street closes at 4pm). Over on Wall Street the opening bell has been rung, and shares are falling as the global selloff reaches New York* The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 175 points, or 1.1%, adding to yesterday's 206 point drop in the immediate aftermath of Bernanke's press conference. The S&amp;P 500, a broader measure of US corporates, is down by 1%. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has dropped by over 1.25%. More reaction to follow. \u2022 - where it began last night, of course: Art Hogan, managing director at Lazard Capital Markets in New York, predicts that traders will overreact to Bernanke's guidance by pushing shares lower: The market tends to overshoot and will continue to do so. We\u2019ll probably see an overreaction to this. Hogan also cited the fears over China, and the fact the eurozone is still in recession -- two factors that could imply the Fed's stimulus may be needed for longer. The key to the Fed's quantitative easing strategy is the state of the US jobs market, and today's weekly jobless data (released a few minutes ago) doesn't really change the big picture. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit rose last week to 354,000, from 336,000. However the measure of 'continued claims' dropped by 40,000 to 2.951m -- which suggests the labour market is improving, in line with the Fed's forecasts. Mike Ingram, market strategist at BGC Brokers, warns that Ben Bernanke may have kicked off a bout of 'economic guerrilla warfare'. He told clients: It\u2019s not often that I am seriously surprised by economic policy makers, but last night\u2019s performance by the US Federal Reserve certainly qualifies for this dubious honour. With an unexpectedly upbeat assessment of the US\u2019 economic prospects, an exit path from quantitative easing (QE) was duly mapped out. I was clearly not alone in being caught off guard; markets worldwide have plunged in response. The tide of red now engulfing my screens is indeed impressive in its breadth-if not yet depth. Virtually every financial asset has been sold. Equity, credit, bonds, commodities; all have suffered. At the epicentre of Fed action, 10 year bond yields are now at their highest level in 2 years and still rising. Average US mortgage rates are pushing through 4% and rising at their fastest level in more than a decade. In Europe today, equity markets have suffered even bigger losses and pushed them into negative territory for the year. Ominously, the bonds of Europe\u2019s troubled periphery seem to have been singled out for particular punishment. Europe's stock markets have kept falling as Fed chair Ben Bernanke's signal that the US will rein in its stimulus package later this year (story) hits the financial world hard. In London the FTSE 100 fell to its lowest level since late January. It's currently down 142 points, or 2.2%, at 6206. Traders often talk about screens being bathed in red -- and this was the picture at lunchtime: The Footsie, like other share indices, had climbed to higher-and-higher levels in recent months as central banks kept stimulating their economies through money printing, which helped to reassure investors. Having been whipped up over the 6,800 point mark by mid-May, it's now experienced an (overdue?) correction since \u2013 as investors recognised that the party couldn't last forever. Mining stocks dominate the fallers in London, partly due to concerns over the Chinese economy after its factory output took a dive this month. Slowdown fears dominate. In Europe, though, luxury goods firms are suffering, with Swatch and Richemond falling over 3%. Amid the selloff, France's CAC index and Germany's DAX are down 2.4%, the Spanish IBEX is 2.2% lower, and Italy's FTSE MIB is off 1.8%. Cavendish Asset Management's European equities fund manager Caroline Vincent told Reuters that she expects European markets to retreat over the next few months, but doesn't expect a full-blown crash. I think we will have a quiet few months but I don't see any reason for a crash. I'm not turning more defensive. See 11.31am for a full round-up of reaction. And round we go.... Wall Street is expected to join the global selloff when trading begins in New York in just under three hour's time. The futures market suggests the Dow Jones industrial average will drop 120 points at the open, on top of the 200 point slide last night as US traders reacted to Bernanke's press conference. Here's a round-up of analyst reaction to the heavy falls in Europe and Asia's stock markets, and the drop in the price of commodities. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets UK, puts his finger on the contradiction in today's selloff \u2013 the Federal Reserve is going to slow its money printing programme because the US economy is improving. Basi explains: Within minutes of the statement equity indices were trading markedly lower, as traders demonstrated the market\u2019s dependence on the artificial stimulus of quantitative easing when it comes to support for risk assets. He adds that rumours that the Chinese government is cracking down on lending have added to the alarm. Weaker data out of China and speculation over tightening credit conditions added weight to the bear argument, and has left shareholders wearing sharp losses this morning. Luca Jellinek, head of European interest-rate strategy at Credit Agricole, told Reuters that Ben Bernanke had caught the markets out by painting such a clear path towards more normal conditions. Bernanke came across as being quite clear and I think people were hoping for a less clear cut path to higher rates and that came as a little bit of shock. Over at IG, sales trade Yusuf Heusen says Ben Bernanke has \"put the cat well and truly among the pigeons\" by predicting that the Fed will start to slow its asset purchase scheme. It does feel as if the Fed chairman has pulled the rug from underneath the stock market rally, and he certainly seems to have dealt a killer blow to gold. Mr Bernanke might have said that the Fed wasn\u2019t looking to apply the brakes on easing, but he certainly had that effect on stocks. The US economy might be getting better but this will be cold comfort for investors today. Until the dust settles, it is hard to say where the latest bout of selling will end. James Humphreys, senior investment manager at Duncan Lawrie Private Bank, is encouraged by the world's most powerful central banker's comments: We see (Bernanke's statement) as a good sign in the long-term as it shows that a return to normal monetary policy is in the offing, that economic growth is picking. But on Twitter, analysts, traders and fund managers are sounding the alarm: Oil, gas and foodstuffs have also fallen in value today alongside precious metals, underlining the extend of today's selloff. Here's the latest prices, from the Reuters terminal: Here's the details of the precious metals selloff: The gold price has dropped to a two-year low of $1,288 per ounce, down $85. Silver is down 2% to $21.18 per ounce, the lowest since autumn 2010. Today's tumbling shares, bonds and commodities appears to confirm two truths \u2013 the markets have become dangerously obsessed with central bank help, and they're deeply worried about China. Last night's comments from Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke (full story here) could have been taken as a positive signal -- the Fed is actually more optimistic about getting the US unemployment rate down over the next year. But that means the central bank will probably stop buying US debt and mortgage securities by next summer \u2013 it's currently mopping up a jaw-dropping $85bn in newly created money each month. The news that factory output in China fell again this month has left economists wondering quite how seriously its economy is slowing (see the 8.38am post for details). Better news \u2013 UK retail sales bounced back last month, as online shopping and discounting at superrmarkets lured consumers to spend again. Sales were 2.1% higher in May than April, smashing economist forecasts. The selloff in the financial markets has intensified through the first 90 minutes of trading. Gold has hit a two year-low, and silver is at its weakest point since September 2010, as commodities prices slid. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains that the gold price could fall further. Gold prices, for so long the preferred safe haven play are starting to near precarious territory in the wake of last night\u2019s statement by the US Federal Reserve, as they moved closer to the exit door of their multi trillion dollar stimulus program. Currently at three year lows there is a risk we could see an even bigger sell-off if the $1,300 level is breached significantly. Shares and government bonds continue to be thumped too, as Ben Bernanke's comments about the Fed slowing its bond-buying plan drives. Here's the damage: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 125 points at 6223, -2% \u2022 German DAX: down 202 points at 7996, -2.5% \u2022 French CAC: down 89 points at 3749, - 2.33% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 127 points at 7,970. -1.6% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 196 points at 15,849, -1.22% And in the bond markets, sovereign debt has fallen across the board. US Treasuries continue to weaken, pushing the interest rate, or yield, on 10-year American bonds up to 2.37% - adding to yesterday's losses as investors anticipate an end to the Fed's bond-buying. Eurozone peripheral debt has also suffered, from German to Greece. And as explained at 9.06am, British 10-year gilts have fallen to their lowest price since March 2012. More gloom for the eurozone \u2013 Germany's private sector suffered a slump in new business this month, suggesting that Europe's largest economy may have failed to grow over the last three months. Markit's flash PMI survey (a monitor of private sector output) rose to 50.9 in June, but also showed that its manufacturing sector probably shrank. On a brighter note, the contraction in France's private sector eased, which meant the 'composite' PMI for the eurozone hit a 15-month high. But the suggestion that Germany has stagnated between April and June is bad news for the region. Britain's borrowing costs have jumped this morning, as government debt falls across the board in a wide-ranging selloff. The yield (or effective interest rate) on UK 10-year gilts rose as high as 2.29%, from 2.13% yesterday before Ben Bernanke gave his clearest signal yet that the US's monetary stimulus programme will slow later this year. That's the highest yield on UK gilts since March 2012, which means it will cost the Treasury more to sell new government debt to investors. The graph above shows how gilt yields have been rising since the start of May, as traders anticipated an end to the bull market for bonds. However, it's still quite low in historical tems -- 10-year gilts were yielding more than 4% five years ago, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Markets have also been hit by disappointing data from China overnight, showing that factory output has fallen to its lowest level since last September. The nine-month low raised new fears over the strength of China's economy, which already appeared to be losing some impetus. The flash HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 48.3 in June from May's final reading of 49.2, which means a sharper contraction in activity. Reuters has more details: China's economy grew at its slowest pace for 13 years in 2012 and so far this year data has been weaker than expected, bringing warnings the country could miss its growth target of 7.5 percent for this year, though possibly not by much. And as the economy shows signs of faltering, a squeeze in Chinese money markets over the past two weeks has sharply tightened monetary conditions, adding to the pressure on the People's Bank of China to take steps to ease policy. \"Headline activity indicators such as industrial production and fixed asset investment are weak but are not collapsing, while labour market conditions remain tight,\" said Zhang Zhiwei, economist at Nomura International in Hong Kong. \"We believe the government is committed to tolerating short-term pain to achieve its policy objectives \u2013 containing financial risks and secure sustainable growth in the long term.\" More Asian losses - China's CSI300 slid 3.3% to a six month low, while Seoul's market hit its lowest level in nearly 11 months. Mining groups are leading the fallers in the City, led by Randgold Resources. That follows a fall in the gold price overnight after Bernanke's press conference. With every share losing ground on the FTSE 100, here's the 10 companies that have fallen the most (including seven miners). Europe's stock markets are trading, and there are heavy losses across the board as investors get their first opportunity to respond to Ben Bernanke's performance last night (see 7.33am onwards). In volatile early moves, the FTSE 100 fell by as much as 98 points, or 1.5%. Every single share has fallen. It's a simiilar picture across Europe, with the German Dax falling 1.4%, Spain's IBEX off 1.5% and France's CAC down 1.6%. As suspected, traders have not liked the sound of the Fed's stimulus programme being slowly withdrawn, even though that would mean that the US economy had recovered. Details to follow It's not just shares that are falling today \u2013 India's rupee has hit a new record low against the US dollar overnight. The rupee, which has been under pressure for weeks, hit a low of 59.935 to the dollar at one stage. This prompted the government's chief economic adviser to tell the press that India will take action if needed to stabilise its currency. We're not short of instruments if necessary, Raghuram Rajan said. Asia felt the effect of Bernanke's QE predictions overnight, with Japan's Nikkei falling 1.75% or 230 points to close at 13,014. It had been clawing its way back from last week's rout, as this graph shows: And in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng fell more than 3% to a nine-month low. If you missed Bernanke's press conference, I covered it in last night's liveblog, from around 7.30pm. There's also details of the Fed's monetary policy decision, and its new economic forecasts (it's more optimistic about the US labour markets) from 7pm. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. It's shaping up to be a rough day in the financial markets, after the Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke gave the clearest signal yet that America will start the process of slowing its stimulus package later this year. Asian stock markets have fallen overnight, and the future's market suggests Europe will follow. IG was calling the FTSE 100 down nearly 100 points. At last night's press conference, Bernanke told reporters that the Fed expects to start the process of slowing its bond-buying programme (currently $85bn per month) during 2013, assuming its economic forecasts are accurate. On that timetable, it would stop the whole process by next summer. As our Wall Street correspondent, Dominic Rushe, points out, Bernanke tried not to cause alarm: In an effort to assuage investors' concerns over the consequences for the world's largest economy, Bernanke likened the move to \"letting up the bit on the gas pedal as the car picks up speed, [and] not pressing on the brake.\" Here's Dom's story from last night: Federal Reserve hints it could end stimulus program next year However, this clarity about the Fed's plans may not be welcomed in the financial markets, where the steady flow of easy money \u2013 and the confidence it created \u2013 has help fuelled the recent stock market rally. Meanwhile in the eurozone, finance ministers from across the single currency are gathering for a Eurogroup meeting. On the agenda - Cyprus, after the island republic flagged up the pain caused by its bailout programme. And in Greece, the coalition leaders are set for a third meeting to discuss the political crisis created by the closure of its state broadcaster last week. Tin hats on, as they say in the City...",

Economists said the latest data suggested the broader economy was likely to grow by 0.5% in the second quarter, beating the 0.3% rise in GDP in the first quarter. \"Improved consumer confidence helped drive retail sales to the highest ever in June, adding to signs that the UK economic recovery is gaining momentum,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. \"However, falling real incomes remain a concern and will weigh on the recovery, limiting the rate at which the economy can grow,\" he added. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the better-than-expected retail sales eased the pressure on Bank of England policymakers to further loosen monetary policy with additional quantitative easing. The Bank's monetary policy committee has already pumped \u00a3375bn into the economy through QE, and interest rates have been held at a record low of 0.5% since March 2009.",
