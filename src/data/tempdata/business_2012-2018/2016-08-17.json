Activity Band would be a means of getting kids to be more active, Digital Trends reported. On Wednesday, it voluntarily removed the device from its restaurants and was \u201cinvestigating\u201d the issue. \u201cWe have taken this swift and voluntary step after receiving limited reports of potential skin irritations that may be associated from wearing the band,\u201d Terri Hickey, a McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman said in a statement. The colorful plastic device strapped on like a watch and tracked steps. It blinked as the wearer walked and blinked more rapidly the faster they moved. \u201cPhysical activity is important to everyone of all ages. We very much support children\u2019s well-being,\u201d Michelle McIlmoyle, senior marketing manager for McDonald\u2019s Canada, said in an earlier press release according to Digital Trends. The news of the fitness-minded move was seemingly tied to the Rio Olympics, which the chain sponsors. McDonald\u2019s has made numerous Rio-themed tweets since the Games began \u2013 many of them showing kids playing sports. In the Olympic village, athletes and coaches get free McDonald\u2019s and have been taking full advantage. The line is often out the door. Athletes have been ordering so much that there\u2019s now a limit on how much one person can order, according to the Washington Post. With Step-it, McDonald\u2019s seemed to be jumping onto a recent trend of step counting. Many smartphones and smartwatches come with the feature. An entire industry has formed around the device as brands like FitBit or Jawbone become even more popular and high tech. Mashable tried out the McDonald\u2019s device and noted that it didn\u2019t seem built to last or accurate. \u201cNevertheless, for the children who will use the Step-It, the apparent progress shown on its tiny screen will likely be enough to encourage the wearer to keep trying to rack up the steps,\u201d Mashable reported. On Twitter, the National Eating Disorders Association criticized McDonald\u2019s for associating fitness tracking with meals. \u201cKids shouldn\u2019t have to \u2018earn\u2019 a meal!\u201d the association tweeted. The chain has been criticized in the past for giving out toys with its food. Fitness trackers have been praised by certain healthcare experts as a way to motivate kids to exercise. \u201cI love it that Happy Meals will include a Step-it because it promotes physical activity,\u201d Lisa Gualtieri, an assistant professor of public health at Tufts University School of Medicine, told Boston Magazine. \u201cIt gives children a greater awareness of their step count. From a public health perspective, increasing awareness of and providing education about physical activity is beneficial.\u201d Others pointed out the irony of the fast food chain giving away a health minded object. Many rushed to try it out. Already, one parent posted a video of his five-year-old daughter running around gleefully with the step counter. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s, you did right,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can\u2019t stop. It\u2019s just constant. She\u2019s gonna sleep great.\u201d The chain put out similar activity toys during the 2012 Olympics in London.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Government proposals to impose heavy fines on banks, accountants and lawyers who market tax avoidance schemes will fail without more resources for HM Revenue &amp; Customs to pursue offenders, campaigners have said. The Treasury is suggesting that professionals who facilitate unlawful tax avoidance should pay penalties of up to 100% of the tax owed if schemes are defeated in tribunals. Under proposals published on Wednesday, the tax office could also name and shame repeat offenders. \u201cIn principle what this government is proposing sounds good, but the means are not there to deliver it,\u201d said Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at the University of Essex and a leading voice in the tax reform debate. \u201cWe simply do not have the judicial capacity to deal with this. It needs court time, and these proposals are are not curbing giving advice on tax avoidance, only if that advice is deemed unlawful will a penalty be imposed. So the game continues.\u201d Vicky Johnson, the president of the Association of Revenue and Customs, called on the government to \u201cprovide HMRC with the investment it needs to be properly resourced\u201d. The rate at which government tax inspectors are leaving the civil service for far better paid jobs at big accountancy firms is increasing, Johnson said. After rounds of job cuts, pay caps and more recently pay freezes, HMRC was facing the \u201cperfect storm\u201d, she said, with a sizeable group of senior inspectors nearing retirement and younger trainees, recruited in their hundreds since 2012 to replace them, ready to take private sector jobs. The proposals to fine enablers are designed to target a small group of repeat offenders. They will apply to banks, trustees, accountants, lawyers, financial advisers and company formation agents such as Mossack Fonseca, the law firm at the centre of the Panama Papers, an unprecedented leak of 11.5m files from the database of the world\u2019s fourth biggest offshore law firm. The consultation states: \u201cThe vast majority of tax agents, intermediaries and others who provide services in relation to the taxation consequences of commercial arrangements, or who facilitate their implementation, operate within the spirit of tax law and do not enable tax avoidance. But a minority do enable tax avoidance.\u201d An investigation by MPs on the public accounts committee in 2013 found that the commissions paid to the promoters of tax avoidance schemes can be up to 20% of the tax saved. The committee, then chaired by Margaret Hodge, suggested following the example of Australia, which requires promoters of avoidance schemes to get a ruling from the tax office before implementing them. It highlighted the abuse of tax breaks for film and video game productions by accountants including Ingenious Media. Earlier this month, HMRC claimed victory in a four-year battle against Ingenious for a scheme that allowed investors in blockbusters including Avatar to claim tax relief. In 2014, HMRC won its eighth tribunal case against the tax consultancy NT Advisors, saying its pursuit of the company had protected \u00a3750m in tax. The radio presenter Chris Moyles was among those penalised. He had been an investor in NT\u2019s Working Wheels scheme, which involved notional trading in secondhand cars. KPMG, one of the big four accountancy firms potentially targeted, welcomed the new measures. A spokesman said: \u201cTimes have changed and the debate around tax has changed too. What was seen as acceptable behaviour is no longer regarded as appropriate.\u201d Jolyon Maugham QC, a tax barrister, described the proposals as \u201cvery strong medicine indeed\u201d in a Twitter post, saying advisers who seek to profit from avoidance \u201cshould be put at risk\u201d. HMRC says it wins 80% of cases that go to court, and that it has collected more than \u00a32bn from users of tax avoidance schemes under rules introduced by the government in 2014, which mean avoiders must pay tax upfront while their returns are investigated. There was, however, a backlog of 27,000 cases waiting to be heard at HMRC tax tribunals as of last December. A spokesman said: \u201cHMRC is tripling the flow of avoidance cases to the tribunals over the next two years. \u200eThe government has given \u00a37m of additional funding to HMRC, and an additional \u00a370m to the Ministry of Justice to handle the increased flow of cases.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve held off on raising interest rates in July due in large part to possible long-term risks related to Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Minutes from the July meeting, which were released on Wednesday, mentioned Brexit 20 times. The economic uncertainty triggered by the referendum vote is one of a number of factors that have split the Fed\u2019s board. The minutes show several Fed members believe the continuing strength of the US job market means a rate increase could soon be warranted, while others argued for caution and to keep rates at their historic lows. Analysis by the US central banks showed that the US reaction to the EU referendum was temporary. \u201cFollowing the outcome of the 23 June referendum in the United Kingdom in which a majority indicated a preference to leave the European Union (EU), yields on US Treasury securities fell sharply, US equity prices declined, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar increased,\u201d the Fed pointed out. \u201cHowever, these changes generally reversed in subsequent weeks.\u201d The Fed also noted that following the vote, the early indicators pointed to a slowdown in economic growth in UK and that while the \u201cnegative sentiment surrounding the Brexit\u201d had been alleviated, \u201cseveral long-term global risks related to Brexit remained\u201d. In the US, the Fed expected the labor market to continue to strengthen even as some members noted that a slowdown in job creation might lead to a delay in future interest rate rises, the July minutes show. Earlier this week, New York Fed president William Dudley noted that an interest rate rise in September \u201cis possible\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re edging closer towards the point in time where it will be appropriate, I think, to raise interest rates further,\u201d Dudley said in an interview on the Fox Business Network. According to him, strong job growth and potential wage growth signal that the economy is in \u201cOK shape\u201d. Dudley is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-setting part of the Fed. In June, the Fed held off on raising the interest rates for the fourth time this year due to the disappointing May jobs report. However, job creation has been up in the two months since, with 292,000 jobs added in June and 255,000 jobs added in July. About 190,000 jobs had been added each month over the past three months, Dudley pointed out. Despite the strong labor market, a Reuters poll of 95 economists found that they believed there was only a 25% chance of a rise in September. Most economists expect just one rate rise this year. And while the Fed will be meeting three more times before the end of 2016 \u2013 in September, October and December \u2013 the rise is expected to come in December, bringing the interest rate range to 0.50%-0.75%, up from 0.25%-0.50%. \u201cThe election is one of the reasons why they can\u2019t go sooner,\u201d Justin Lederer, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, told Reuters. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the Fed will want to disrupt the election.\u201d The Fed\u2019s meeting on 13 and 14 December will mark one year since the Fed last raised rates. After raising rates for the first time in almost a decade, the US central bank was expected to raise rates four times this year. Since then, uncertainty about the Chinese economy, low oil prices and Brexit have all contributed to the Fed\u2019s decision to hold off on another interest rate rise.",

      "bodyText": "If you put Brexit to one side, the latest unemployment figures are no surprise. They show that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate remained at 4.9% at the end of June, the lowest since 2005, while the number of people claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance dropped by 8,600 to 763,600 in July, the first fall since February 2016. These headline figures are a continuation of recent trends and reflect a growing economy. However, economists were surprised by the numbers because they had expected a rise in the claimant count on the back of the result of the EU referendum on 23 June. With hindsight, a Brexit-driven shift in the unemployment numbers was unlikely. While companies such as Unilever, JP Morgan and Airbus warned that voting to leave the EU would make doing business in Britain more difficult, they had little incentive to cut jobs immediately after the referendum. As it stands, Britain is still in the EU and we have little idea about what Brexit will look like. The drop in the value of sterling has actually made doing business in Britain more profitable for companies exporting goods and services from the country. The early evidence suggests consumers are more bothered about the warm weather than Brexit, so shops, pubs and other high street businesses do not need to make cutbacks. Retail sales rose by 1.9% year on year in July, the best performance since January according to the British Retail Consortium and KPMG, as shoppers splashed out on summer clothing and barbecue food. The impact of Brexit on the economy will not be known for some time. It will be judged by the size of company cutbacks, but also by planned investments and expansion plans that are scrapped. This is why the Bank of England has cut forecasts for 2017 and 2018 rather than this year. So while the unemployment figures show the economy did not go into shock straight after the vote, Brexiters have little reason to celebrate yet. Is Deliveroo\u2019s model under threat in courier row? The protests by Deliveroo workers about their pay highlights that the online revolution is still to solve the biggest conundrum facing shops, restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses \u2013 the last mile. The \u201clast mile\u201d is the phrase used in retail and logistics to describe the process of getting a customer\u2019s order to their front door. For online businesses, the last mile is remarkably inefficient compared with the rest of their operation. Even the zaniest technological advances imaginable do not change the fact that a business must find a way to get its product to the customer. The beauty of a shop or restaurant is that this cost is put on the shopper. In a supermarket, for example, the shopper travels to the store, picks the products off the shelf, then goes home. But online food retailers, such as Ocado, have to bear these costs themselves. This is why a string of online businesses, including the mighty Amazon, have struggled to make a profit despite growing sales rapidly. It is also a good reason why the restaurants for which Deliveroo delivers food were not doing it themselves. Deliveroo has to keep costs under control to make its model work, meaning the amount it pays its couriers is key. The company does not publish its financial results so the health of its balance sheet is not clear. William Shu believed he had identified a gap in the market when he founded Deliveroo in 2013. But a mile is a big gap to fill. TfL\u2019s English language exam proposal for cabbies tests everyone\u2019s patience Transport for London\u2019s attempts to rein in Uber are becoming ugly. TfL is proposing that drivers applying for a private-hire licence who are from countries where English is not the main language will have to present a certificate showing they have a B1 level of English on the Common European Framework. This certificate requires a two-hour exam that costs \u00a3200 to sit. The new requirements are more stringent than those facing bus drivers, train drivers and other public servants. Uber accepts that drivers should be proficient at spoken English, but believes the proposals go too far and that the company and its drivers are being unfairly targeted \u2013 hence the legal action. TfL says it wants to enhance public safety, but it would be wise to reconsider its position. While public safety and reducing the number of cars on London\u2019s roads are laudable targets, fighting against technological developments and protecting the status quo \u2013 which is what this looks like \u2013 are not. Uber has grown rapidly in London and other cities because its users believe it offers value and convenience compared with the alternatives. The company is not going away. It should be considered as part of a solution for London\u2019s traffic problems, rather than a problem. Rivals who have lost market share because of Uber should focus on improving their service, while TfL should focus on more important things than making taxi drivers write essays.",

      "bodyText": "The British public\u2019s confidence in the economy recovered in August as the country appeared to shrug off concerns that the Brexit vote would harm prospects for jobs and higher wages. The rebound in sentiment followed a slump in July as consumers fretted about the impact that leaving the EU would have on disposable incomes. Low earners and public sectors workers were the most pessimistic in the latest monthly survey, while the highest earners and private sector workers were the most confident about the outlook for their finances. Confidence measures are watched closely by economists, who say a drop can cause people to stop spending, which hurts the economy and stifles investment. Expectations for finances over the next 12 months picked up to 49.8 on the Markit household finances index in August, from 47.1 in July. Anything below 50 signals deterioration, so households believe the outlook is stable, but they are still feeling cautious. Jack Kennedy, a senior economist at the financial data provider, said that July represented a wobble following the Brexit vote. \u201cConcerns seem to have eased in line with the removal of some of the immediate political uncertainty arising from the shock referendum result, combined with a strong monetary policy response from the Bank of England aimed to cushion the economy and head off any lurch towards recession,\u201d he said. A counterpoint to Markit was provided by a survey from the pollster TNS, which found household confidence had fallen sharply since the vote to leave the EU, with 33% of Britons believing the economy has worsened compared with a year ago, up 11 percentage points from April. The snap poll of 1,199 people also showed that fewer expected to see a pay rise in the next 12 months and more thought the economy would fare worse over the next year. \u201cThe latest data suggests that confidence in the economy is back down at levels last seen in 2011/12, when the country [last flirted with] recession,\u201d said Luke Taylor, the head of social and political attitudes at TNS. Retail sales data on Thursday will provide the first official steer on how consumer demand has been affected by the unexpected result of the 23 June referendum, after other measures have painted a mixed picture. Major retailers including Tesco, Next and John Lewis say they have not been affected so far by the referendum result, and the British Retail Consortium said spending in shops bounced in July. A CBI survey of wholesalers and retailers, however, found that sales volumes declined more rapidly in July than at any time since January 2012, with weaker consumer confidence a likely factor in the immediate period following the referendum. The long-running GfK survey, Britain\u2019s main gauge of consumer morale and considered a reliable indicator of future household spending over the years, suffered its sharpest drop since 1990 last month.",

      "bodyText": "British Airways cabin crew have voted for industrial action, but have stopped short of going on strike in the first dispute between the airline and its flight attendants since the bitter battles of 2010. Members of the 8,800-strong British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association (BASSA), a section of the country\u2019s largest trade union Unite, backed action short of a strike, with 91% of votes returned in favour. The move comes as union officials have been pressing the airline to drop its new performance review system, which provides onboard staff with immediate feedback on their performance from passengers and colleagues. The information is presented via a \u201cdashboard\u201d that includes staff league tables and red warning lights showing if the cabin crew member\u2019s performance has been rated as poor. The airline says such systems are common in all industries and help to improve staff performance. Unite claims its members are getting blamed for situations that are not their fault, including crew receiving poor feedback from passengers disgruntled about faults in the entertainment systems or air conditioning. Matt Smith, a regional Unite officer, said: \u201cOur members have voted overwhelmingly against the introduction of this flawed dashboard scheme. The BA management should note the enormous strength of feeling against this policy with what, we suspect, is a hidden agenda of future job losses. A perfectly adequate performance management policy already exists. \u201cIt is completely unfair to expect them to be placed in a league table, competing against each other, over onboard issues that are clearly out of their control. \u201cCabin crew time spent on these wasteful performance schemes is crew time not giving passengers value for money in a highly competitive premium market.\u201d The industrial action will take the form of cabin crew declining to engage with the new performance management system, including refusing to sign off feedback forms. The action is a far cry from the bitter dispute of six years ago over staffing levels, when thousands of staff took part in 22 days of walkouts that cost BA \u00a3150m. BA\u2019s decision to cut staffing levels on long-haul flights, which triggered the dispute, was not reversed. In response to the Unite vote, BA said: \u201cWe can reassure our customers that they will experience no inconvenience as a consequence of this ballot result. Unite has been clear from the start that it would not take strike action. \u201cThe system we have recently introduced includes feedback from customers about how they are looked after onboard. This sort of feedback is common in all industries and enables us to commend cabin crew who perform well and support those that need to improve. \u201cA similar system already exists for many crew. It allows us to offer our customers the very highest standards of service. We remain open to discussions with our cabin crew and their union representatives about this new system.\u201d",

In the week that sterling slipped to a new three-year low against the euro following the Brexit vote, researchers found that bureaux de change at Stansted and Luton airports were offering just 99 cents for every pound exchanged. Last month, \u00a31 was buying \u20ac1 at some airport currency exchange bureaux, but these rates have now worsened, according to currency specialist Caxton FX, which surveyed the walk-up rates at several airports this week. Holidaymakers using the Moneycorp exchange booth at Stansted airport to buy currency were being offered just \u20ac0.9915 for each \u00a31 exchanged. The rate on offer at the ICE (International Currency Exchange) bureaux de change at Luton airport was even lower at \u20ac0.9900. At those rates, \u00a31,000 would buy \u20ac991.50 and \u20ac990 respectively. The weak pound has meant pricier holidays for millions of Britons travelling to Europe, the US and other destinations this summer. At one point on Tuesday, \u00a31 was worth just \u20ac1.1476, its lowest level since August 2013. Sterling has since rallied a little, with \u00a31 buying \u20ac1.15500. That compares with \u20ac1.30 the day before the referendum in June, and \u20ac1.42 in August 2015. The rates offered to those who turn up at airport bureaux de change without pre-booking their holiday currency have long been poor, but appear to have hit a new low. Pre-ordering currency \u2013 either for home delivery or for pick-up \u2013 is one way that consumers can secure a better rate. Caxton FX said it obtained the rates over the phone directly from the bureaux. It added that airport bureaux de change had a captive audience, \u201cwhich means that in spite of poor rates, they will still have a large customer base\u201d. Alexandra Russell Oliver, an analyst at the firm, said: \u201cThe pound fell below 1.1500 against the euro for the first time since August 2013. An already weak pound has faced additional woes recently due to increased stimulus measures and disappointing data from the UK.\u201d Tracy Bownes, Moneycorp\u2019s retail director, said: \u201cForeign exchange rates tend to differ between airports and other retail outlets \u2013 be it online or on the high street. There are various costs associated with operating at an airport, and this cost model is the main reason behind the varied rates.\u201d She said customers could access more competitive rates by ordering online via its reserve and collect service, and opting to pick up their currency at a designated airport bureau. Koko Sarkari, chief operating officer of ICE, said: \u201cWe work hard to keep our prices fair and competitive around the world. However, due to differences in distribution, costs of operation, regional competition and other factors such as ongoing volatility in the market, as we are experiencing now, online prices may not be the same as our ICE branch prices, and prices may also vary between branches because of these factors.\u201d He added that the company offered a number of way for travellers to buy currency, including online, in advance at one of its branches, or even at the last minute at the airport. Sarkari said ICE offered an online service with next-day delivery.",

      "bodyText": "More than a million workers from eastern Europe are working in Britain following a rise in the number of foreign nationals entering the labour market before the Brexit vote. The total number of EU workers employed in the UK increased by almost 90,000 in the three months to the end of June, pushing the overall employment rate to another record high in statistics, which were published on Wednesday. Part of the rise in employment was attributed to non-UK EU nationals, and especially those from eastern Europe. The number of migrant workers from Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia topped 1 million for the first time. Migrant workers from these eastern European countries reached a record 1,007,000 in the second quarter of the year, up 44,000 on the previous quarter. The number of workers from outside the UK increased by 110,000 to 3.45 million in the second quarter, compared with a rise of 58,000 in the number of UK nationals in work to 28.2 million. Britain\u2019s attraction as a destination for EU workers is expected to wane over the next year as the impact of the falling pound, a weaker economy and a degree of negativity about migration from some quarters act as a deterrent. Jonathan Portes, an economist of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, said all three factors would lead to a sharp fall in numbers and meant recent figures represented a \u201chigh watermark\u201d. John Philpott, the director of JobsEconomist.com, said: \u201cThere will be some migrants who think twice about coming to the UK because it could be more difficult to settle and they might feel they are more vulnerable to abuse.\u201d The Office for National Statistics figures also indicated that the jobs market had not been dented in the immediate aftermath of the vote. The ONS said the claimant count \u2013 the number of people claiming jobless benefits \u2013 fell by 8,600 to 763,600 in July, compared with expectations of a rise of 9,500, to leave the total number on job related benefits at 763,600. It was the first monthly fall since February 2016 and appeared to dispel fears that the Brexit vote would trigger panic among employers and widespread job losses. Economists welcomed the jobs report, which showed that there were 31.75 million people in work in the second quarter of the year, 172,000 more than for January to March 2016 and 606,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate, which measures the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who are in work, was 74.5%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. The unemployment rate in the three months to the end of June was unchanged at 4.9%. Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose 2.3% over the same period, up from 2.2%. The number of people unemployed, defined as those not in work but seeking and available for employment, was 1.64 million for the three-month period, the lowest since March to May 2008. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, said concerns about the economic impact of the Brexit vote were not supported by the data, at least in the short term. He said: \u201cAhead of the referendum, speculation was that the economy would grind to a halt, hiring would stall and investment plans would be put on ice. The first two haven\u2019t happened; we will find out next week whether the third came good. \u201cBut this does provide a glimmer of hope that if fears of the pre-Brexit jitters proved unfounded, maybe the post-referendum doom and gloom may equally prove to have been overcooked.\u201d Recent surveys have shown that while many companies have shelved investment plans and industries such as construction have suffered a sudden loss of confidence, employers are reluctant to cut staff for what may prove to be a short lived period of uncertainty. A report by the Treasury collating the predictions to 2020 of independent economic forecasters found a consensus that economic growth would remain muted between now and the end of the decade. Predictions that growth will remain below 2% also meant unemployment would rise by about 350,000 to approximately 2 million people. Wages growth was likely to remain subdued, especially after being adjusted for inflation, which has begun to rise. The Resolution Foundation, an independent thinktank, said that with inflation up from below zero last year to 0.6% last month and expected to climb more steeply in the coming months, \u201cBritain\u2019s poor performance on pay is a major cause for concern\u201d. Scott Bowman, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe vote to leave the EU should cause some firms to put hiring decisions on hold or cut back headcounts altogether, resulting in the unemployment rate drifting up over the coming quarters. This should contain any further rises in earnings growth and keep domestic cost pressures in check.\u201d He added that the Bank of England should be able to follow through with more monetary easing to support the economy, such as interest rates and a multibillion-pound bond-buying programme, without worrying about stoking domestically generated inflation too much.",

      "bodyText": "A number of disappointing company results - from brewer Carlsberg, Austrian brickmaker Wienerberger and insurer Admiral - helped send stock markets into negative territory. Investors were also nervous ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve minutes, and what they might hint about the course of interest rates, as well as the continuing uncertainty over the fallout from the Brexit vote. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 34.77 points or 0.5% at 6859.15 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.3% to 10,537.67 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.96% lower at 4417.68 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.58% to 16,528.36 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.56% at 8487.0 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.86% to 567.49 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 23 points or 0.12%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here are some more pictures of the protest against the Bank of England\u2019s quantitative easing programme. A protest against the Bank of England\u2019s quantitative easing programme is taking place in London at the moment. Organised by protest group Positive Money, it wants the bank to implement other measures rather than QE, which it believes just benefits financial markets. The pound has slipped back to below its pre-jobs data level against the dollar. It is currently down 0.26% at $1.3012, having earlier climbed as high as $1.3070. Against the euro, sterling is down 0.15% at \u20ac1.1548. Markets are taking a bit of a dip ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting, despite oil prices holding up after the US data. But investors also have the UK jobs data and the uncertainty of the Brexit negotiations on their minds. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: There is a certain degree of trepidation in the markets today, with indices selling off sharply in anticipation of the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s last meeting, due out this evening. The July FOMC meeting took place after market fears had subsided in the wake of the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership, with the statement citing diminished near-term risks. If the committee no longer believes external factors are worth worrying about, then a 2016 rate hike is a distinct possibility. Given that much of the post-referendum surge in stocks has come from dovish monetary policy implications, hawkish comments are likely to exacerbate the weakness we are already seeing for markets today. Today\u2019s UK jobs report is significant in the post-referendum world, with Brexiteer jeers ringing out as they use the figures to back their argument that the pro-remain camp was fear-mongering with its warnings over the impact on the economy. It is certainly too early to say how the UK economy will react to the referendum result and eventual Brexit from the EU, but today\u2019s surprise decrease in July claimants suggests that businesses are waiting it out rather than making any rash judgements of the implications. Comments from Germany\u2019s European Affairs Minister hinting that the UK may be able to obtain a \u201cspecial status\u201d post-Brexit are an encouraging signal ahead of the exit negotiations. Once article 50 is enacted, any perceived developments within trade discussions are sure to be significant volatility drivers in the markets, raising the prospect of two years of unpredictability. The number one concern within the city is whether the UK will retain passporting rights, and success on this issue could define whether negotiations are perceived as a success or failure within financial markets. And now oil is recovering some ground after the US inventory figures showed an unexpected fall last week. The Energy Information Administration said crude stocks dropped by 2.5m barrels compared to forecasts of a 522,000 increase. Gasoline stocks fell by 2.7m barrels, much higher than the expected 1.6m barrel drop. Following the figures Brent crude is now in positive territory, up 0.1% at $49.28 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is down 0.19% at $46.39, having earlier been as low as $45.84. Ahead of the latest weekly US oil stocks report, Reuters is reporting that Saudi Arabia could boost its output in August to a new record of 10.8m to 10.9m barrels a day. The news has pushed oil prices slightly lower, with Brent crude now down 0.35% at $49.06 a barrel. As expected US markets have followed the example of Europe and slipped back in early trading. But investors remain cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve minutes due later. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 41 points or 0.22% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq opened virtually flat. US markets are expected to open roughly flat as investors await the FOMC minutes from the July meeting later in the day. UK working age households are still \u00a3400 a year worse off than before the 2008 financial crisis according to Resolution Foundation. The thinktank warns that a near \u201clost decade\u201d in household incomes is in danger of being extended by a triple whammy of slower economic growth, higher inflation, and benefit cuts. Resolution\u2019s analysis of ONS figures found that working age households have been the ones to suffer. Adam Corlett, economic analyst at Resolution Foundation: Despite welcome income growth in 2015-16, the typical non-retired household remains some \u00a3400 a year worse-off than before the financial crisis of 2008. We\u2019re closing in on a lost decade for working-age households, which leaves the typical family around \u00a38,500 a year poorer than would have been the case had we maintained pre-crisis levels of income growth. The concern now is that lower income working-age households risk experiencing a \u2018triple whammy\u2019 of income recovery shocks as growth slows in the aftermath of the EU referendum vote, inflation picks up and cuts such as the four-year freeze on working-age benefits start to bite. This risks not only delaying the recovery for these families, but flipping it into reverse. Gold prices have slipped following those hawkish comments from Fed policymakers William Dudley and Dennis Lockhart. Both said a September interest rate rise was possible, sending spot gold down 0.2% at $1,343 an ounce, while US gold was down 0.6% at $1,348.60 an ounce. Rate rises tend to mean a stronger dollar, and a stronger dollar tends to signal weaker gold prices. Uber, the taxi company that operates through an app, is legally challenging Transport for London\u2019s plans to force drivers to take a written English test. Our full story here: Andrew Tyrie, Conservative MP and chairman of the Treasury select committee, is seeking a review of the government\u2019s sale of some of its stake in bailed out bank RBS. Specifically, Tyrie wants the National Audit Office to look without delay into the advice given by UK Financial Investments - the body set up to manage the taxpayer\u2019s stakes in bailed out banks - to the government before the first sale of shares in 2015. Tyrie says: Parliament and the public will want reassurance that the Chancellor\u2019s decision to sell the first tranche of shares in RBS in August 2015 secured the best value for money for the taxpayer, and was not influenced by political expediency. UKFI was created with the intention to ensure that state and partly state-owned banks are run, and seen to be run, free from government interference. There is a risk that UKFI is being used as a fig leaf to disguise a high level of Treasury control. UKFI\u2019s advice on this sale is therefore of considerable public interest. A full and thorough review of the sale should not be left any longer. Households were less pessimistic about the outlook for their finances in August according to the latest survey from Markit. It followed a slump in July as consumers were concerned about the impact the Brexit vote would have on disposable incomes. Expectations for finances over the next 12 months picked up to 49.8 on Markit\u2019s household finances index in August, from 47.1 in July. Anything below 50 signals deterioration, so households are still feeling cautious. The highest earners and private sector workers were the most confident about the outlook for their finances. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit: The outlook for household finances stabilised in August after last month\u2019s wobble following the Brexit vote. Expectations regarding future finances improved to the highest for five months, while current finances remain under pressure but no more so than the trend seen over the past year-and-a-half. Concerns seem to have eased in line with the removal of some of the immediate political uncertainty arising from the shock referendum result, combined with a strong monetary policy response from the Bank of England aimed to cushion the economy and head off any lurch towards recession. Jasper Lawler from CMC Markets has this take in this morning\u2019s drop in European markets: European markets dipped on Tuesday as profit-taking continued for a second day. Shares of Carlsberg led the declines after a rise in profits at the Dutch brewer fell short of estimates. The German DAX has fallen to its lowest in over a week after turning positive for the first time this year on Monday. Trading was thin on the FTSE 100 with minimal share price movement as traders took stock of a fall in employment claims and another sign that the economy has held its own post-Brexit. Lawler says Wall Street\u2019s opening is likely to be mixed as traders await the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting in which rates were held. The minutes are due at 7pm UK time. Chris Hare, economist at Investec, brings us back down to earth with this rather gloomy take on the UK jobs market and outlook for households: In coming months, we anticipate a hiring slowdown to lead to a sharp slowing in, or even a contraction in, net job creation. We anticipate that to be reflected in gradual rises in the unemployment rate. Meanwhile, post-referendum falls in sterling (down over 10% since 23 June) is set to squeeze household real take-home pay. Over time, this double-whammy of lower jobs growth and higher inflation is set to weigh on household income and spending growth. If we are right (and we hope to be surprised to the upside) then this new dynamic might make today\u2019s labour market data look like a relic of a bygone era. Here is our full story on Admiral, which is dragging the FTSE 100 lower with an 8.5% drop in the share price. The upbeat jobs report has failed to lift the pound, which remains pretty much where it was before the figures were published at $1.3019. The FTSE 100 is also underwhelmed, and European markets are now in the red after opening slightly higher. As John Philpott, expert on the labour market and director of The Jobs Economist, points out, the better-than-expected figures could be the calm before the storm... Frustratingly, most of these figures end just at the point at which the UK decided to make its historic change of political and economic direction. It\u2019s thus too early to tell whether the jobs market will easily shrug-off the shock of Brexit or instead that these latest figures merely mark the calm before the storm that many economists fear could add up to 500,000 to the jobless count. In the run up to the referendum the jobs market was strengthening, and in better shape than expected. \u201cWhat pre-Brexit jitters?\u201d, asks Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank: The UK labour report was much stronger than we expected and surprisingly robust in the face of pre-referendum uncertainty. Firms stepped up hiring before the referendum it seems - in stark contrast to the pre-General Election experience. The acid test will be the next few months to see if hiring stalled in the aftermath of the vote. I suspect that will take longer to show up, but then again, I was expecting pre-Brexit jitters to show up today, so what do I know? In the three months ending June: Unemployment fell by 52,000 over the quarter to 1.64m people. It was the lowest since early 2008, months before the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9%, as expected. The last time it was lower was in 2005. The number of people in work increased by 172,000 to 31.75m people. Full-time workers totalled 23.22m, while part-time workers totalled 8.53m. The employment rate hit a new record high of 74.5% - the highest since comparable records began in 1971. Averages wage growth was 2.4% including bonuses, and 2.3% excluding bonuses. The number of people aged 16 to 64 who were economically inactive (not working and not looking for work or not available for work) fell by 58,000 to 8.84m. The surprise fall in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits in July suggests the Brexit vote did not deal a major blow to employer confidence, in the immediate aftermath at least. A total of 763,600 claimed jobless benefits last month, 8,600 fewer than in June. It was the first monthly fall since February 2016. The labour market report from the Office for National Statistics also showed the ILO unemployment rate was unchanged in the three months ending June, at 4.9% (as expected). This measure relates to the period before the EU referendum on 23 June. Wage growth including bonuses ticked up to 2.4% over the period from 2.3% over the previous three months - bang in line with expectations. Excluding bonuses, wages increased by 2.3%, up from 2.2%. A big surprise in the labour market data: the number of people claiming unemployment benefits fell by 8,600 in July, a month after the Brexit vote. Economists were expecting a rise of 9,500. No sign yet then that the Brexit vote is hurting the jobs market... We will bring all the reaction. The pound is managing to hold on above the $1.30 mark, although it is down 0.2%. It is currently trading at $1.3014. Sterling rebounded on Tuesday following a surprise rise in the UK annual inflation rate to 0.6% in July from 0.5% in June, which in theory makes it less likely that the Bank of England will need to further cut rates. Economists said however the Bank was likely to ignore a temporary rise in inflation and pump more money into the economy in a bid to limit the slowdown expected following the Brexit vote. The government has revealed plans to clamp down on accountants, lawyers and consultants who advise clients on how to aggressively avoid tax. Advisers whose schemes are defeated in the courts might pay a fine of up to 100% of the money lost to the taxpayer. Our full story here: Admiral Group is the biggest FTSE 100 faller this morning by quite some margin. Shares are down more than 7% after the insurer issued a number of warnings falling Britain\u2019s decision to quit the EU. Admiral said its solvency ratio had been damaged by the vote, and warned about a weaker economic outlook and interest and exchange rate volatility. In the US, comments by Fed policymakers have brought forward expectations of a interest rate rise. The New York Fed President William Dudley said it was \u201cpossible\u201d the central bank could hike rates at its next policy meeting in September as the US jobs market strengthens. He told the Fox Business Network: We\u2019re edging closer towards the point in time where it will be appropriate I think to raise interest rates further. The labor market is getting tighter and we\u2019re starting to see signs of wage gains starting to accelerate, so I think we\u2019re getting closer to that point in time when it will be appropriate to actually raise short-term rates again. Meanwhile Dennis Lockhart, President of the Atlanta Fed, said the US economy was potentially strong enough to withstand two rate rises before the end of 2016. Addressing the Rotary Club of Knoxville, he said: I would not rule out September. If the meeting were today I think the economic data would justify a serious discussion. It\u2019s conceivable we could have two rate increases this year. Early indications of third-quarter GDP growth suggest a rebound. I don\u2019t believe momentum has stalled. I remain confident about prospects in the second half of 2016 and 2017. Before the comments, market expectations of a US rate hike before the end of 2016 had declined. But according to CMC Markets, Dudley\u2019s comments saw expectations of a move in December climb from 39.1% to 50%. At 7pm UK time, minutes of the latest meeting of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will be published. The FTSE 100 is up 23 points or 0.3% in early trading, at 6,916. Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% France\u2019s CAC: +0.4% Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.3% Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% The FTSE 100 is expected to open slightly higher this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The spotlight is on the UK jobs market today. At 9.30am the Office for National Statistics will publish the latest unemployment data. Much of the data, including the ILO unemployment rate and total number of people out of work, will relate to the three months ending June - before the 23 June EU referendum. But the claimant count data will reveal how many people claimed unemployment benefit it July, a month after the Brexit vote. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting a 9,500 jump in claims last month, following a rise of 400 in June. On the ILO measure, the unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 4.9% in the three months ending June. Wage growth (including bonuses) is expected to pick up slightly to 2.4% from 2.3%.",

The July FOMC meeting took place after market fears had subsided in the wake of the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership, with the statement citing diminished near-term risks. If the committee no longer believes external factors are worth worrying about, then a 2016 rate hike is a distinct possibility.

If the meeting were today I think the economic data would justify a serious discussion. It\u2019s conceivable we could have two rate increases this year.</p> <p>Early indications of third-quarter GDP growth suggest a rebound. I don\u2019t believe momentum has stalled. I remain confident about prospects in the second half of 2016 and 2017.</p> </blockquote> <p>Before the comments, market expectations of a US rate hike before the end of 2016 had declined.

The British brand, best known for its floral frocks, is to open a website via Chinese online operator Tmall, owned by Alibaba, and will also begin selling clothing in the first Chinese House of Fraser store, which will open in Nanjing this autumn. Sea\u0301n Anglim, Laura Ashley\u2019s finance director, said its long-term aim was to find a Chinese franchise partner. \u201cChina is not easy as evidenced by how many have got in and how many have come out. It is all about finding the right partner and doing it at the right time,\u201d he said. Laura Ashley already has franchise partners in 30 countries and sells online in six. Anglim said the company wanted to expand that further with new websites planned in Hungary and the Czech Republic in coming months. The move into China was revealed as Laura Ashley, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange but controlled by Malaysia\u2019s MUI Group, reported a \u00a325.8m profit for the 74 weeks to 30 June. Comparing the performance to the previous year is not straightforward given the longer time period, which came as the company moved its year end from January to June, but pro-rata profits before exceptional items fell 19%. Group sales rose to \u00a3400.9m, including like-for-like retail growth of 4.1%, adjusted to allow for the differing accounting periods. The company chairman, Dr Khoo Kay Peng, said the results had been boosted by a 15.7% like-for-like rise in online sales. \u201cIn a time of uncertainty for retail and the global economy at large, I am optimistic and confident that Laura Ashley will remain a business with solid foundations to withstand challenges as they arise,\u201d he said. Like-for-like UK retail sales rose nearly 16% despite the company reducing its store count by 13 to 192. Anglim said Laura Ashley was likely to close further stores but the size of the chain would not change dramatically. \u201cA store presence is critical to us.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fears that a Brexit vote would trigger widespread job losses were not realised last month, with the number of people claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance unexpectedly falling. The claimant count fell by 8,600 to 763,600 in July, compared with expectations of a rise of 9,500, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It was the first monthly fall since February 2016. The unemployment rate in the three months to the end of June was unchanged at 4.9%. Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose 2.3% over the same period, up from 2.2%. The number of people unemployed, defined as those not in work but seeking and available for employment, was 1.64 million for the three-month period, the lowest since March to May 2008. There were 31.75 million people in work over the three-month period, 172,000 more than for January to March 2016 and 606,000 more than for a year earlier. Part of the rise was attributed to non-UK EU nationals, and especially those from eastern Europe. The number of migrant workers from Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia topped 1 million for the first time. A record 1,007,000 migrant workers came from these countries in the second quarter of the year, up 44,000 on the previous quarter. The number of non-UK nationals in employment increased 110,000 to 3.45 million in the second quarter, compared with a rise of just 58,000 in the number of UK nationals in work to 28.2 million. The employment rate, which measures the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work, was 74.5%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, said concerns about the Brexit vote were not supported by the data. He said: \u201cAhead of the referendum, speculation was that the economy would grind to a halt, hiring would stall, and investment plans would be put on ice. The first two haven\u2019t happened; we will find out next week whether the third came good. \u201cBut this does provide a glimmer of hope that if fears of the pre-Brexit jitters proved unfounded. Maybe the post-referendum doom and gloom may equally prove to have been overcooked.\u201d But several economists warned that cutbacks over recent months by firms to their investment plans and a freeze on new hiring by many employers were early indicators of a worsening employment picture over the next year, dampening annual pay rises. Scott Bowman, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe vote to leave the EU should cause some firms to put hiring decisions on hold or cut back headcounts altogether, resulting in the unemployment rate drifting up over the coming quarters. This should contain any further rises in earnings growth and keep domestic cost pressures in check.\u201d He said the Bank of England should be able to follow through with more monetary easing to support the economy, without worrying about stoking domestically generated inflation too much. The unemployment announcement comes hot on the heels of Tuesday\u2019s inflation update, when the consumer prices index (CPI) rose to a higher than expected 0.6% in July. CPI was up from 0.5% in June, according to the ONS, with economists expecting the figure to be unchanged. But while there was no sign of the plunge in the value of the pound having an impact on CPI, the ONS said the producer prices index (PPI) showed that sterling\u2019s slump had pushed up the cost of imports for British manufacturers, which could fuel inflation down the line. Input prices rose 4.3% in the year to July, compared with a drop of 0.5% in the year to June, as the PPI was affected by the fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote, which drove up the cost of imported metals and chemicals.",

This should contain any further rises in earnings growth and keep domestic cost pressures in check.\u201d</p> <p>He said the Bank of England should be able to follow through with more monetary easing to support the economy, without worrying about stoking domestically generated inflation too much.</p> <p>The unemployment announcement comes hot on the heels of Tuesday\u2019s inflation update, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/first-post-brexit-data-shows-uk-inflation-rose-to-06-in-july\">the consumer prices index (CPI) rose to a higher than expected 0.6% in July</a>. CPI was up from 0.5% in June, according to the ONS, with economists expecting the figure to be unchanged. </p> <p>But while there was no sign of the plunge in the value of the pound having an impact on CPI, the ONS said the producer prices index (PPI) showed that sterling\u2019s slump had pushed up the cost of imports for British manufacturers, which could fuel inflation down the line. </p> <p>Input prices rose 4.3% in the year to July, compared with a drop of 0.5% in the year to June, as the PPI was affected by the fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote, which drove up the cost of imported metals and chemicals. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Admiral shares have fallen after the car insurer said low interest rates following the vote to leave the EU had weakened its capital strength, though it said its financial position remained strong. Announcing results for the first half of 2016, Admiral said lower interest rates had increased the value of liabilities for claims and reduced its capital compared with liabilities. That caused the company\u2019s solvency ratio, a measure of financial strength, to fall from 206% at the end of December to 180% at the end of June. A ratio of 100% means an insurer has enough capital to meet all its liabilities and Admiral said its day-to-day business would be unaffected. Geraint Jones, Admiral\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cWhat we saw immediately after the Brexit vote were quite sharp falls in gilt yields and risk-free interest rates. Lower interest rates mean bigger claims liability valuations and a lower solvency ratio.\u201d Shares of Admiral, which owns the Confused.com price comparison site, dropped 7.7% to \u00a320.81 in early trading on Wednesday and were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 index. Jones said he was not concerned and that Admiral still had a strong capital position. \u201cI would consider 150 to be a very strong solvency ratio for an order of risk profile like ours,\u201d he said, and a figure approaching 200 put Admiral in a comfortable position. Analysts at UBS said the weakened solvency ratio had reduced the surplus capital available for Admiral to pay out to shareholders. After saying in March it would return \u00a3150m-\u00a3200m over two or three years, the figure has been reduced to \u00a3100m-\u00a3150m, they pointed out. Admiral said there were further potential risks for its business from the vote to leave the EU, including volatile interest and exchange rates, restrictions on UK financial companies trading in the EU and a weaker UK economy. Jones said car insurance business usually held up well during an economic downturn because it was a legal requirement. \u201cThe police make you buy car insurance so it\u2019s not a discretionary purchase. Some people may get rid of their car or downgrade their coverage but sales of our products are fairly resilient.\u201d Hard times might also reduce the number of car journeys, resulting in fewer accidents, he said. Pre-tax profit for the year to 30 June rose 4% to \u00a3193m. The company increased its interim dividend to 62.9p from 51p.",

David Lockwood, chief executive of Laird, will take over from Murphy by the start of 2016. Cobham, which supplies radar and other electronic products for industries including defence and aviation, said Murphy was leaving by the end of the year to pursue other opportunities after four years in charge. The company warned in April that annual profit would be lower than expected. At the same time it launched a \u00a3500m rights issue, completed in June, to strengthen finances partly weakened by debt taken on to buy US communications equipment maker Aeroflex in 2014. This month the company reported a 36% drop in first-half profit, leaving it needing a big improvement in performance to meet full-year targets. The company\u2019s performance was also affected by delayed shipments at its wireless communications business and lower demand from oil and mining customers for flying services in Australia. Lockwood has run Laird, which makes wireless systems and materials to protect electronics from heat, for the past four years. Before that he was vice-president of global defence and security at BT Global Services and worked at other companies including the aerospace and defence groups BAE Systems and Thales. John Devaney, Cobham\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cDavid has a background in defence and communications technology which are at the heart of Cobham.

Only one thing is sure - unpicking Britain\u2019s membership will be a monumental task requiring years of arduous and painstaking negotiations. \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine a more complicated and more difficult issue to take forward,\u201d said Andrew Hood, a senior director at the Dechert law firm and a former legal adviser to David Cameron. \u201cPeople at the heart of government were sitting down a week after the Brexit decision with an entirely blank sheet of paper.\u201d The UK will have to negotiate no fewer than six deals to re-establish its place in the world after Brexit, according to Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform thinktank. Negotiations will be far longer and more complicated than many British politicians realise, for reasons he set out in a recent paper. One set of talks will cover Britain\u2019s EU divorce, a second the free-trade agreement with the union and a third will be needed to work out interim measures while the talks are being thrashed out. Number four on Grant\u2019s list is regaining full membership of the World Trade Organisation, five is replacing the trade deals the UK enjoys as an EU member and six will be to sort out the UK\u2019s future ties with the EU on foreign, defence and security policy. At the same time, the British government will have to work out how to keep the country united. Then there is resetting a swath of policies across sectors including science and research, farming and fisheries, environment and support for poorer regions \u2013 an agenda British officials expect will dominate every Queen\u2019s speech for a decade. The huge and complex will be managed by a civil service that has reached a postwar low in staff numbers against the backdrop of an economy teetering on the brink of recession. The gruelling marathon of negotiations starts with Britain\u2019s EU exit, a process that will involve 27 other member countries and three union institutions: the European council, European commission and European parliament. The UK will have to negotiate its divorce with the EU under the now famous article 50. A spokesman for May reiterated this week that it would not be triggered before the end of the year, setting the clock ticking on a two-year deadline to conclude the exit talks. These discussions will be far from simple, throwing up knotty questions \u2013 for example, who pays the pensions of 2,700 current and retired British EU officials. In parallel, the UK will start talks on a new trading relationship with the EU, a negotiation that the European council president, Donald Tusk, has speculated could take at least five years. Several Brussels insiders think this is overoptimistic, which is why many also expect an interim deal to ease the transition. Next on the government\u2019s to-do list is re-establishing trading links with all major trading partners outside the EU. The UK will have to regain full membership of the WTO, and re-sign the 39 trade deals covering 65 countries negotiated by the EU. Britain joined the WTO in 1995 under the umbrella of the EU, which represents its member states in international trade talks. Roberto Azev\u00eado, the WTO director general, warned in the run-up to the 23 June vote that \u201ckey aspects of the EU\u2019s terms of trade could not simply be cut and pasted for the UK\u201d. When asked about Brexit, a WTO official referred back to those remarks, where Azev\u00eado stressed \u201ctrade would continue [but] could be on worse terms\u201d. He also said British exporters could face \u00a35.6bn in extra duties on goods they want to sell abroad. In order to re-establish credentials in the WTO, the UK needs the approval of 164 members from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. Most observers do not see this as an insurmountable hurdle, but some countries could use the opening to seek better trade terms or as leverage on something else. \u201cThe history of the WTO shows that things can move very slowly and other factors, beyond the intrinsic merits of whatever the trade deal is, can come into play,\u201d said Hannah White, the Brexit lead at the Institute for Government thinktank. British trade negotiators will have to get into the mind-boggling arcana of WTO agreements governing tariffs and subsidies, known as schedules. One of the first questions is what happens to the EU schedules. The EU, for example, can import 58,000 tonnes of top-quality steak from South America under WTO rules, but no one knows how much of that share belongs to the UK. \u201cThere will be a three-way negotiation between us, the WTO and the EU,\u201d White said. Meanwhile officials from the newly created trade department will be jetting around the globe to keep British ties with the 65 countries that have a trade agreement with the EU. Before the Brexit vote, leave campaigners assumed these deals would continue seamlessly. Trade arrangements with the rest of the world would remain \u201ctotally unchanged\u201d, the former chancellor Nigel Lawson said. But every single one could be reopened. In an ideal world countries would keep existing deals going, Hood said. \u201cBut will most countries want to do that? If I were in their shoes, I would be thinking hard about how I get the best deal for my country.\u201d Brexiters have enthused about selling more to the US and China, but about two-thirds of British trade is done either with the EU or countries that have signed a trade deal with the bloc. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which has done the number-crunching, points out that no free trade agreement would be as good for the UK\u2019s crucial service sector as the EU single market. Tariffs and subsidies are important for buying and selling beef or bananas, and selling services abroad requires getting into the nitty-gritty of common regulations and professional standards. The UK is legally barred from signing any trade agreements while it remains an EU member. Any would-be trading partners the UK woos will want to know what kind of access to the EU single market Britain will have before they sign. The US trade representative, Michael Froman, has played down hopes of a quick deal, noting it was \u201cnot possible to meaningfully advance\u201d UK-US trade talks until some of the basic issues on the future EU-UK relationship had been worked out. None of these trade talks can begin seriously until the government has worked out pressing domestic questions. Will British farmers be protected against cheaper competition with import tariffs? Is the government prepared to \u201cmostly eliminate\u201d manufacturing by opting for unfettered free trade, as the leading leave economist Patrick Minford has argued? Will the four nations and all the regions of the UK get behind the vision of turning Britain into a \u201cbuccaneering offshore low-tax nation\u201d favoured by some leave campaigners? A month after the vote, these questions have barely been discussed. While these policy debates rumble on, the UK is scrambling to create a trade department from scratch. The government aims to have 300 specialist staff in place by the end of the year, a spokeswoman said, but it is unclear how many will have had direct experience of trade negotiations. Even 300 would not be enough. One former EU trade negotiator, Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez, estimated the UK would need at least 500 negotiators. The EU typically sends 20 commission negotiators to any round of trade talks, backed up by between 25 and 40 technical experts, she wrote in the FT earlier this year. The UK has 40 trade negotiators, compared with the 550-strong trade department in Brussels. Keeping democratic oversight of years of painstaking, highly technical and politically charged negotiations with scores of countries will also be a mammoth task for Britain\u2019s elected representatives. \u201cKeeping parliament updated when negotiations are running on different tracks will be a really big challenge,\u201d White said. She wants to ensure any new parliamentary committees set up to scrutinise Brexit have \u201ca clear role and route to influence government\u201d. For now, parliament\u2019s means to hold the government to account over Brexit remain hazy. It is just one more of the many unanswered questions about what it really means to take back control.",
