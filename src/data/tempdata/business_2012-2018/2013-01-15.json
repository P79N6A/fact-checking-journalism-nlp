      "bodyText": "Millions of pounds of HMV gift cards and vouchers \u2013 many received as Christmas presents only weeks ago \u2013 have been declared worthless by the collapsed music and movies retailer in what is thought to be the most controversial such move for many years. HMV directors, who handed the company over to administrators Deloitte on Tuesday afternoon, said they were unable disclose how many vouchers had been sold in the runup to Christmas, or what value had been lost by customers. The sum is thought likely to be many times the \u00a3800,000-worth of vouchers that went unhonoured at camera retailer Jessops after it failed last week. Thames Valley police confirmed that they had been called to an incident at an HMV store in Oxford after a dispute over a gift card between two customers and staff. Holders of gift cards are particularly frustrated as HMV continued selling them and vouchers after warning investors on 13 December that the group expected to face a solvency crisis by the end of January. A spokesperson for Deloitte said the administrators had no intention of reviewing the decision to stop accepting vouchers. This was in contrast to the same team of administrators approach to vouchers issued by Comet, the electrical retailer which failed in the autumn. Faced with bad publicity over a four-year-old cerebral palsy sufferer who had been unable to buy an iPad with vouchers, they had a change of heart. With potential voucher claims running into many millions of pounds, no such U-turn is expected at HMV. Recent administrations of similar companies such as Zavvi and Game have seen also seen thousands of vouchers unhonoured. Customers can submit a claim to the administration process, but returns are typically a tiny fraction of the face value, and take months to come through. HMV, one of Britain's biggest voucher and gift card retailers, typically takes 60% of its annual sales in the last four months of the year, with the busiest trading weeks being those before Christmas. However, any reserves are now likely to swallowed up by preferred creditors in an administration process. These include taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, who would have played a leading role in selecting the timing of the administration. Asked if the sale of thousands of vouchers after HMV's December solvency warning amounted to a mis-selling scandal, finance director Ian Kenyon said the company was confident of its legal position, having checked with lawyers back in December. \"We had a reasonable expectation [in the runup to Christmas] of addressing our issues with the banks,\" he said. Whatever the legal position, it remains to be seen whether the company will face a backlash from consumers. Kenyon said a \"substantial amount\" of vouchers bought as Christmas gifts had already been redeemed. HMV vouchers have also been sold by other retailers, including Tesco and WH Smith. The supermarket group said on Tuesday: \"We are currently not able to offer refunds to customers. We will continue to assess the situation with HMV and work towards a solution that will help customers affected.\" A spokesperson for WH Smith could not be reached for comment but HMV gift cards appeared to still be on sale on the group's website. Deloitte issued a statement saying it would continue to operate all 223 stores, with 4,123 staff. \"We are working closely with management and staff to stabilise the business in order to continue trading whilst actively seeking a purchaser for the business and assets.\" Expressions of interest have already been received from potential buyers of some or all of the business. Among those thought to be interested is Better Capital, run by turnaround financier Jon Moulton. The failure of such a high-profile business as HMV has prompted a round of urgent reflection among high street retailers, with politicians growing increasingly concerned at the impact online traders are having on traditional shops. The business secretary, Vince Cable, said: \"What's happened is that you have had a very rapid growth of e-shopping, people buying online. Britain is one of the most dynamic countries in the world in that area and this has been very much at the expense of some of the more traditional retailers.\" Asked if online retailers enjoyed an unfair advantage because they were able to arrange their tax affairs to pay lower tax than high street rivals, Cable said: \"You are right about that.\" He told Channel 5 News: \"Certainly the information such as I have seen about Amazon is very disturbing and it does indicate that government has got to be tough and, as far as we can be within our national frontiers in making sure that companies do pay their tax, that is absolutely right. I do accept the point specifically about Amazon.\" HMV's chief executive, Trevor Moore, gave an impassioned defence of the chain on Tuesday hours before it formally passed out of his control, saying it deserved a place on Britain's high streets. \"Ian [Kenyon] and I are really passionate about working with the business,\" said Moore, who was the boss of Jessops until he joined HMV in September. \"I would very much like to be involved \u2026 if the opportunity presents itself. He added: \"HMV was recently voted one of the top 10 names people most wanted on their high street \u2026 A high street without HMV is not as attractive as it is with one. We know our customers feel the same way.\" Moore repeatedly thanked suppliers for having been supportive, despite the failure in recent weeks of the group's major creditors \u2013 banks, landlords, film houses and record labels \u2013 to agree revised terms that would keep HMV afloat. Kenyon said sales over the Christmas trading period had not suddenly fallen off a cliff. At the last update, like-for-like sales were down just over 10% in the six months to the end of October. HMV held last ditch discussions with its banks over the weekend but failed to agree on new terms for its loans. It said in a statement that the board had been \"unable to reach a position where it [felt it was] able to continue to trade outside of insolvency protection.\" As the reaction to HMV's demise has shown, the brand, famous for its Nipper the dog trademark, still holds a cachet for many people.",

With some 3 million people working in the UK retail sector, it is the biggest private sector employer.</p> <p>Palmer said: \"Overall, the sectors that are most vulnerable include those affected by shoppers moving to online or digital formats, such as specialists in music, games, books, news and stationery along with the specialists that are most affected by the convenience and price-driven offering of the supermarkets, which includes chemists, health and beauty, and alcohol retailers.\"</p> <p>The gloomy outlook for the sector came as the music chain HMV followed camera-supplier Jessops into administration after lengthy battles by both companies to unearth business models that could compete with online retailers.</p> <p>The problems have been mirrored elsewhere on the high street, where stores such as JJB Sports and Comet have collapsed in recent month.</p> <p>Figures produced by RSM Tenon accountancy group show that in 2012 about 1,300 retailers became insolvent, meaning they could not pay their debts \u2013 a rise of 7% on 2011. Chris Ratten, the firm's head of restructuring, said: \"We expect this year to be worse, as those who have managed to teeter on the edge for the past few years will feel the full effects of the reduction of discretionary spending, fierce competition and reducing cash reserves.</p> <p>\"We believe 12,679 retailers have a high risk of insolvency out of more than 100,000 retailers nationally.\" The number at high risk, he said, was 40% up on December 2011.</p> <p>Michael Ingram, a market analyst with City broker BGC, said: \"UK retail woes don't end there. Disposable income in the UK is still being squeezed mercilessly: wage growth is running at less than half the rate of inflation (1.3% versus 2.7% on the consumer price index and 3.0% on the retail price index), while inflation in non-discretionary items, such as fuel and water tariffs, is running at over 6%.</p> <p>\"To top it all, consumer credit has, at best, flatlined over the last six months. One way or another, shoppers in the UK have less money to spend and they are increasingly circumspect of how they spend what remains. [For some retailers] the internet has brought unwelcome transparency to premium pricing.\"</p> <p>The slump has also left many high streets depressed, with the British Retail Consortium (BRC) estimating that one in nine town centre shops is empty, the highest level since the trade body began compiling data, in July 2011.</p> <p>However, the BRC also recently produced more optimistic data. Its employment monitor, covering August to October 2012, showed the number of retail jobs grew by 2.9% compared with a year earlier, although the gains were in the grocery sector; jobs created in non-food stores fell.</p>",

The problems have been mirrored elsewhere on the high street, where stores such as JJB Sports and Comet have collapsed in recent month. Figures produced by RSM Tenon accountancy group show that in 2012 about 1,300 retailers became insolvent, meaning they could not pay their debts \u2013 a rise of 7% on 2011. Chris Ratten, the firm's head of restructuring, said: \"We expect this year to be worse, as those who have managed to teeter on the edge for the past few years will feel the full effects of the reduction of discretionary spending, fierce competition and reducing cash reserves. \"We believe 12,679 retailers have a high risk of insolvency out of more than 100,000 retailers nationally.\" The number at high risk, he said, was 40% up on December 2011. Michael Ingram, a market analyst with City broker BGC, said: \"UK retail woes don't end there. Disposable income in the UK is still being squeezed mercilessly: wage growth is running at less than half the rate of inflation (1.3% versus 2.7% on the consumer price index and 3.0% on the retail price index), while inflation in non-discretionary items, such as fuel and water tariffs, is running at over 6%. \"To top it all, consumer credit has, at best, flatlined over the last six months. One way or another, shoppers in the UK have less money to spend and they are increasingly circumspect of how they spend what remains. [For some retailers] the internet has brought unwelcome transparency to premium pricing.\" The slump has also left many high streets depressed, with the British Retail Consortium (BRC) estimating that one in nine town centre shops is empty, the highest level since the trade body began compiling data, in July 2011. However, the BRC also recently produced more optimistic data. Its employment monitor, covering August to October 2012, showed the number of retail jobs grew by 2.9% compared with a year earlier, although the gains were in the grocery sector; jobs created in non-food stores fell.",

      "bodyText": "Fitch, the credit ratings agency, has warned the chancellor that Britain could be stripped of its prized AAA status if he fails to boost the country's economic situation in the spring budget The agency said the UK remains under \"significant pressure\" following the autumn statement in December, when George Osborne conceded that growth would be lower over the next two years and for that reason he was likely to miss one of his two debt reduction targets. David Riley, the head of global sovereign ratings at the agency, said Osborne's admission was a \"negative event\" for the UK. While he stressed that a downgrade was not a \"decided event\", he said Britain remained \"vulnerable\" to fresh economic \"shocks\" elsewhere in the world. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, he said: \"There is increasing concern that the fiscal consolidation is happening more slowly, that the economy isn't recovering as quickly as we had hoped. \"This does leave the UK quite vulnerable either to a worsening of the situation in Europe or some kind of shock coming from the United States or elsewhere. \"It does mean that its AAA rating is under quite significant pressure.\" Several economists have forecast that the UK will lose its status as one of a handful of countries that retain the much-coveted AAA credit rating. Investors have considered the UK a safe haven, which has allowed it to enjoy low borrowing rates. The fear in the Treasury is that the loss of the AAA rating would push up borrowing costs and make the UK's debt payments more expensive. Fitch has also put the US and France on negative watch, though both countries have been downgraded by other ratings agencies without any discernable effect on their borrowing costs. Riley said the UK could still boast some strong underlying economic \"fundamentals\" to support the AAA rating, but the situation could change if the budget in March showed a further weakening of the public finances. \"If we were, following the budget, to see that the debt is going up even higher than we currently project and is going to peak even later than we currently forecast, then that would put a lot of pressure in terms of the UK AAA rating because essentially, on a very broad measure, it would mean that the UK government is projecting a debt level of 100% of GDP,\" he said. \"In our view that is not really consistent with the UK retaining the AAA rating.\" Riley warned the Obama administration it faces a \"material risk\" of losing its AAA status if there is a repeat of the wrangling seen in 2011 over raising the country's self-imposed debt ceiling. The US hit its $16.4 trillion (\u00a310.2tn) debt ceiling at the end of last year and is now employing special measures to meet its financial obligations. The treasury department said those steps could be exhausted by mid-February. Despite December's deal in Congress to avoid the \"fiscal cliff\" of spending cuts and tax hikes, Riley said pressure on the country's rating was increasing. Standard &amp; Poor's has already stripped the US of its AAA status, while Moody's and Fitch have put it on negative watch. Riley said: \"If we have a repeat of the August 2011 debt ceiling crisis we will place the US rating under review. There will be a material risk of the US rating coming down.\"",

    "webTitle": "US Postal Service pushes the digital envelope in battle for its future", 
    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Paul Vogel, the USPS's new digital guru, has his work cut out for him in the battle to upend mail delivery into the tech world", 
      "body": "<p>Paul Vogel is, in his own words, trying to bring the US Postal Service \"from the today world into the tomorrow world\".</p> <p>Vogel is the president of digital solutions for the Postal Service, a position he's held since last May. The Postal Service is backed into a financial corner \u2013 with losses last year of $16bn \u2013 and there are quite a few people who believe that, to survive, it has to become about more than physical mail. Digital package tracking, quick response codes that would allow consumers to scan their mail with their smartphones, \"m-commerce\" using mobile devices \u2013 this is all part of Vogel's mandate.</p> <p>Vogel considers it his mission to upend mail delivery from being just about catalogs and bills, and make it into a world of platforms and apps. So he doesn't call what he does \"postal;\" he refers to \"the message industry\". The companies and people who use it are \"the message community\".</p> <p>Right now, the postal service delivers around 160bn pieces of mail per year. None of them have pixels. The service is so tightly regulated that it's not even clear yet that it has the legal ability to move into internet messaging. Vogel acknowledges, with some understatement, that he has his work cut out for him. \"We're not seen as a digital brand,\" he says.</p> <p>Vogel models his effort on Silicon Valley tech startups. He describes his Washington office \u2013 in US Postal Service headquarters \u2013 as an open pit, which he compares to a technology lab at your average San Jose start-up. He has 15 developers, all working on Apple and Android applications, and various consultants streaming in and out. Most are contractors. His office has a computer \u2013 just one \u2013 but he rarely uses it: he's addicted to his BlackBerry. \"If it can't be done on mobile, it's probably not worth doing,\" he says.</p> <p>Right now, the postal service's biggest tech effort is the creation of MyPost, a digital platform that it is working on alongside UPS. MyPost would be a kind of personalized website that would allow people to log in and see all the packages that are coming to them, as well as all the packages they've already received, in one digital place. (Vogel likes to order things through the mail, and it annoys him to have to track things down: \"I had a miserable time this Christmas, and I had to go to 10 to 15 sites to find out where things are,\" he recalls.)</p> <p>Hacking is a concern. He's been talking to MIT and Carnegie Mellon about improving internet security to avoid hacking and identity theft; he's been chatting with telecommunications companies and three big banks, which he says are eager to see the postal service get into the 21st century.</p> <p>There are plenty of others. Almost everyone who knows the USPS has ideas on what it could do better. Lawmakers have suggested that it could use its crown jewels \u2013 its fleet of trucks \u2013 as billboards for advertising.</p> <p>Ruth Goldway, the chairman of the Postal Regulatory Commission, says the USPS should act like a start-up in earnest. \"I keep telling them to find some young people and buy them out, the way Google does,\" she says of the search for technological talent. \"Just give them huge contracts.\" Goldway's opinion matters: one proposed piece of legislation would give the commission the ability to approve any new products \u2013 including digital ones \u2013 for the postal service.</p> <p>David Williams, the inspector general for the US Postal Service, audits it regularly. He has ideas for its digital transformation.</p> <p>\"We're strong advocates of extending the embrace of the postal service to include digital communications,\" he says. \"We believe everyone should have an email inbox as well as a mailbox.\" He sees the postal service as being in the center of the American economy. \"It used to be that a person could walk into a marketplace and hand over cash to buy goods. Now all four of those things exist in cyberspace.\"</p> <p>Williams pictures a postal service that could run a kind of e-government platform: an email inbox that would be certified by the post office and that could be used not just for messages, but also as a kind of cloud server to store passwords, medical documents, photographs, authorizations for doctors ... a kind of federal safe-deposit box for sensitive personal information.

      "bodyText": "Paul Vogel is, in his own words, trying to bring the US Postal Service \"from the today world into the tomorrow world\". Vogel is the president of digital solutions for the Postal Service, a position he's held since last May. The Postal Service is backed into a financial corner \u2013 with losses last year of $16bn \u2013 and there are quite a few people who believe that, to survive, it has to become about more than physical mail. Digital package tracking, quick response codes that would allow consumers to scan their mail with their smartphones, \"m-commerce\" using mobile devices \u2013 this is all part of Vogel's mandate. Vogel considers it his mission to upend mail delivery from being just about catalogs and bills, and make it into a world of platforms and apps. So he doesn't call what he does \"postal;\" he refers to \"the message industry\". The companies and people who use it are \"the message community\". Right now, the postal service delivers around 160bn pieces of mail per year. None of them have pixels. The service is so tightly regulated that it's not even clear yet that it has the legal ability to move into internet messaging. Vogel acknowledges, with some understatement, that he has his work cut out for him. \"We're not seen as a digital brand,\" he says. Vogel models his effort on Silicon Valley tech startups. He describes his Washington office \u2013 in US Postal Service headquarters \u2013 as an open pit, which he compares to a technology lab at your average San Jose start-up. He has 15 developers, all working on Apple and Android applications, and various consultants streaming in and out. Most are contractors. His office has a computer \u2013 just one \u2013 but he rarely uses it: he's addicted to his BlackBerry. \"If it can't be done on mobile, it's probably not worth doing,\" he says. Right now, the postal service's biggest tech effort is the creation of MyPost, a digital platform that it is working on alongside UPS. MyPost would be a kind of personalized website that would allow people to log in and see all the packages that are coming to them, as well as all the packages they've already received, in one digital place. (Vogel likes to order things through the mail, and it annoys him to have to track things down: \"I had a miserable time this Christmas, and I had to go to 10 to 15 sites to find out where things are,\" he recalls.) Hacking is a concern. He's been talking to MIT and Carnegie Mellon about improving internet security to avoid hacking and identity theft; he's been chatting with telecommunications companies and three big banks, which he says are eager to see the postal service get into the 21st century. There are plenty of others. Almost everyone who knows the USPS has ideas on what it could do better. Lawmakers have suggested that it could use its crown jewels \u2013 its fleet of trucks \u2013 as billboards for advertising. Ruth Goldway, the chairman of the Postal Regulatory Commission, says the USPS should act like a start-up in earnest. \"I keep telling them to find some young people and buy them out, the way Google does,\" she says of the search for technological talent. \"Just give them huge contracts.\" Goldway's opinion matters: one proposed piece of legislation would give the commission the ability to approve any new products \u2013 including digital ones \u2013 for the postal service. David Williams, the inspector general for the US Postal Service, audits it regularly. He has ideas for its digital transformation. \"We're strong advocates of extending the embrace of the postal service to include digital communications,\" he says. \"We believe everyone should have an email inbox as well as a mailbox.\" He sees the postal service as being in the center of the American economy. \"It used to be that a person could walk into a marketplace and hand over cash to buy goods. Now all four of those things exist in cyberspace.\" Williams pictures a postal service that could run a kind of e-government platform: an email inbox that would be certified by the post office and that could be used not just for messages, but also as a kind of cloud server to store passwords, medical documents, photographs, authorizations for doctors ... a kind of federal safe-deposit box for sensitive personal information. Picturing a potential firestorm over privacy, I asked him if people wouldn't become queasy at the thought of so many personal documents within reach of the federal government. \"It would be strictly voluntary,\" he replied. \"I think there are a lot of assurances against the postal service opening communications.\" Williams, like Vogel, recognizes that smartphones are an increasing part of the economy as well. Williams pictures QR codes on all mail, so, for instance, if you receive a catalog, you could waft your phone over the QR code to find, and buy, offers on the spot. There are some far-out ideas as well. As more distant possibilities, Williams suggests 3D printing to cut down on delivery costs; instead of picking up a package for certain bulky things, you could go to a 3D printing facility that would print it for you. He also mentions \"digital cash\" that would allow the postal service to act like a currency exchange for people who get paid through debit cards \u2013 a growing trend \u2013 but need to actually get cash. But the Postal Service still has some roadblocks. There is the legislative roadblock of obtaining permission to create digital products. The postal service is also not known for being nimble; it currently has a 1500-page instruction manual for people who would do business with the postal service, and that's for only a handful of products. The size of a manual for digital products and security certifications would boggle the mind. In addition, the path of the postal service for the past few years has not been growth, but shrinkage. As mail volumes have fallen, so have staff numbers. There are legislative proposals to cut even further. One casualty of that has been the postal service's retail stores. To get to e- and m-commerce, the postal service would do well, in the eyes of some, to stay in physical commerce first. Goldway is displeased that the USPS has shrunk its number of retail stores, when, in her opinion, it should be expanding its presence in each community to make more money. The options are endless \u2013 at least, until Congress weighs in on the financial future of the USPS, which it is expected to do this year. In the meantime, Vogel, laid up with the flu at home, can't keep the enthusiasm out of his voice. \"I just wish I had a thousand people to work on all of these ideas,\" he says.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When I was going through my late parents' things over Christmas, I came across an album with a sticker on the front \u2013 \"HMV Shops 84p\". The album is John Ogdon and Brenda Lucas's album Two Pianos, featuring duets by Mozart, Brahms and Lutos\u0142awski. I hadn't seen the sleeve in decades, but it was painfully familiar because it used to make regular appearances in our Black Country living room in the 1970s. My dad would every few months swap the record that was accorded the honour of appearing at the front of the LP rack under the Dynatron record player. Petula Clark, Dionne Warwick, Andy Williams, Edward Heath conducting the LSO, Ella Fitzgerald singing the Irving Berlin songbook \u2013 all would get their era of glory. Where did my dad buy Two Pianos? Probably HMV's branch in Wolverhampton's Mander Centre. I see him now, flicking iconoclastically through the classical music section, as around him everybody else was buying Slade's orthographically grotesque Gudbuy T'Jane, Bowie's Pin Ups, Black Sabbath's Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, or Clifford T Ward's Gaye. Now HMV has gone into administration and all I have is memories, and reminders of mortality. As if to prove the last point, the reverse of that sleeve, which was once white card printed with black liner notes, is now speckled brown \u2013 as though it's sprouting liver spots. When I tried to text somebody yesterday about HMV, the spellchecker replaced \"HMV\" with \"Jamb\". Is \"Jamb\" a much-loved high street brand? I don't think so. Step gently, phone spellchecker, for you step on my nostalgic dreams. Forget about measuring my life in coffee spoons; I could measure out my life in closed shops. When Robinson's the bakers in Sedgley's Bull Ring closed during my adolescence, it felt like a terrible betrayal. \"Where will I get my custards tarts from now?\" I wailed (using, fortunately, my silent inner voice). \"The supermarket, bird brain,\" replied my second silent inner voice, adding: \"In fact, you don't even eat custard tarts any more or live in Sedgley, two possible reasons why Robinson's closed.\" \"But surely,\" my first silent inner voice replied, \"the collapse of a retail outlet's business model is hardly reason enough for it to close and cause me all kinds of existential angst, is it?\" \"As a matter of fact, yes, it is,\" replied the second voice. That second silent inner voice, the voice of reason, really gives me the pip. Jonathan Coe, whose novel The Rotter's Club excavates a similar West Midlands 70s terrain to the foregoing, suspects that nostalgia for defunct shops and the old high street is to do with feeling lost in a newer retailing milieu of online shopping and seemingly endless choice. \"Having greater choice has taken us out of that comfort zone. It's like growing up and having to cook for yourself, instead of having your mum put a plate of fish fingers and a bowl of Angel Delight in front of you every evening. I think because our lives were bounded by the same, limited set of choices, people have a memory of being less atomised. Shopping on the high street was a more leisurely and sociable experience, too.\" Well said, though the idea of being fed Angel Delight every evening has a chilling, Guant\u00e1namo vibe. But the second silent inner voice does have a point: one reason shops close is that they are rubbish. Think of Dixons. The name causes in me an anti-nostalgia brought on by the memory of an altercation with a sales assistant in Dixons' Birmingham city-centre branch more than 30 years ago. It was over a non-functioning auto-stop on a radio-cassette player I bought with my pocket money before I was out of short trousers. The assistant didn't take my complaint about his terrible cassette player with any semblance of the deference incumbent on him as a purported retailing professional. I found it impossible to tape my friend's copy of Culture's Two Sevens Clash because of that malfunctioning auto-stop, which made me a playground pariah. Thanks for ruining my childhood, Dixons. So when Dixons merged with Currys and the Currys website issued the following announcement \u2013 \"Whilst the Dixons you love and trust is changing, the people and commitment stay the same. Don't worry \u2013 purchases and agreements you have already made are covered by Currys, so nothing will change.\" I allowed myself a rueful laugh. Decoded: \"Yeah \u2013 don't worry: Currys will be just as rubbish as Dixons was.\" Such is the death of the high street: at one end, it evokes poignant nostalgia \u2013 at the other, outrage at the unfeeling nature of capitalism. Sometimes both at the same time. Remember Fine Fare? I do. An assistant came up to me in the Shirley, West Midlands, branch once in the late 1970s as I examined a tragic single cinnamon stick in a jar. \"It's probably been there for years,\" he counselled, advising me to go across the street to the health food shop where they had fresh spices. That's why Fine Fare closed \u2013 because it was rubbish. It became Safeway. Remember Safeway? I do. It's now a Morrisons, whose end-of-year results didn't look too good. Perhaps it's going to go Fine Fare. And then there will be an article about how lovely it was to shop in Morrisons. Or consider Argos. When Argos closes (and, God willing, it will, because what we're witnessing now is a recession-backed, online-fuelled evisceration of the high street too hideous for even Mary Portas to contemplate), how I'll laugh. Principally because the sales assistant in the Holloway Road branch didn't appreciate my critique of the Bosch vacuum cleaner I was returning a decade ago. I still remember the conversation, with nostalgia mingled with outrage at the unfeeling nature of capitalism. \"It sucks,\" I said imperiously, \"but not in a good way.\" He really didn't understand my wordplay and that, rather than the fact that he wouldn't give me my money back, hurts. Only when Argos finally closes will I too get closure. And now that HMV is to leave our high street, I think of two things: that memory of my dad, but also a memory of a few years ago, when I went to the counter of the Oxford Street branch with a Pingu box set. The assistant asked if I'd like a HMV loyalty card. No thanks. \"Quite right, they're shit,\" he replied. You don't get that sort of language in John Lewis, I told myself using that handy silent inner voice. Possibly because staff at the latter aren't alienated but have a stake in their company's wellbeing, I added silently. It was then that I realised HMV was doomed. When I was working in Paris in 2000, Marks &amp; Spencer announced it was closing all its French branches. \"Where am I going to get my chicken tikka masalas from now,\" wailed a French colleague at the time, possibly in French. Sheez, I thought, is that what the revolutionary spirit of 1789 and 1968 has come to? But there was a twist. There were demonstrations outside the doomed Boulevard Haussmann demanding that M&amp;S stay open to supply Parisians with teabags and Rich Tea biscuits. They refused to accept that capitalist dictates could trample their cherished, though crazy, lifestyle choices. And then, a few years later, M&amp;S returned to France as if to show that their protest was worthwhile. Which, perhaps, it was. There are similar Gallic protests today over the closure of Virgin's megastores across France. What's more, Aur\u00e9lie Filippetti, France's culture minister, recently railed against online retailers who \"completely escape any kind of fair competition, because they don't pay the same taxes as the others, being based elsewhere than in France\". Filippetti clearly means Amazon, and those other globalised retailers of MP3 files who are rendering Virgin and the largest French music store, Fnac, obsolete. The same point could be made by our culture minister, too. Just don't expect the latter to happen any time soon. It's thanks to such online retailers, recession and austerity policies that we're experiencing one of the few booms in recent years; namely, a nostalgia boom, as well-known stores curl up and die, leaving us with memories of ostensibly happier times. That said, there's something pitiful about feeling nostalgic over the death of a favourite shop. It's sad we're so consumerist that our most poignant memories are bound up with retailing experiences. Surely any warm glow we might feel about HMV nostalgia deserves dousing with the news that gift vouchers some bought at the shop over Christmas are now invalid. Why should we feel nostalgic about the demise of an excrescence of capitalism? What are we going to feel nostalgic about next? Cholera? When Ikea closes in the near future (as, please God, it will), will I be tweeting my nostalgic feelings about its contribution to extending allen keys and misery worldwide? Just shoot me now. Stewart Lee satirised lame consumerist nostalgia in an observational bit about that week in the run-up to Christmas 2008, when Woolworths, MFI and Zavvi all closed. At least they left us with some lovely memories, didn't they? he joked. Remember those lovely sweets at Woolworths pick-n-mix? \"Not like today's sweets with knives in them and Aids,\" Lee said. Lee's point here (and it's always nice to have a joke explained to you, isn't it?) is not just that a nostalgia premised on the lie-dream of shopping is degrading, but also that venerating the past over the present, or positing an unrepeatable golden age, and that modern life is rubbish, is nuts. Lee is doubtless right, but I still remember that afternoon I bought Bowie's Heroes for 75p from Reddingtons Rare Records by the underpass to Birmingham's inner ring road. It jumped a bit on V-2 Schneider when I played it yesterday, but it still is bound up with a sense of loss. Reddingtons is now only online, the inner ring road doesn't exist, nor does the foul subway under it, and I still can't play the intro to Joe the Lion. Why is all this so painful? \"Music is a very potent trigger of nostalgia,\" says Dr Tim Wildschut, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Southampton. \"Music shops may therefore be associated with strong nostalgic memories.\" Wildschut, an expert on the bittersweet emotion of nostalgia, has constructed one of my favourite scales of all time \u2013 namely, the Southampton Nostalgia Scale. His work helps explain why we feel more upset about the closure of Our Price, Tower Records, Virgin Megastores, Zavvi, MVC, Music Zone, Andy's, Border's and Woolworths, than, say, Comet. OK, maybe not Zavvi. We grew up with those stores and the music we bought from them, and when they go, just possibly, a little of ourselves dies too. We may feel like that about iTunes one day. Happily, though, for psychologists nostalgia is not just a negative emotion, nor one that necessarily involves wallowing in the past. Wildschut argues that it can be a powerful mood booster. It's a thought echoed by Chicago psychologist Fred Bryant. \"Reminiscence can give you a sense of being rooted, a sense of meaning and purpose \u2013 instead of being blown around by the whims of everyday life,\" says Bryant. In an MP3 world, then, how soothing to recall the era of vinyl or, failing that, of the CD. The risk, of course, is that nostalgia gives you a sense of being rooted in a better past rather than an unbearable present. Because while the present \u2013 MP3s, corporate tax evasion, capitalism at its most venal, the wanton destruction of the cherished high street \u2013 may be hideous, the past wasn't any better. Just before filing this piece, I played my dad's old LP of Ogdon and Lucas performing Mozart's sonata for two pianos in D major. It sounded good, but I'm sure a remastered download would sound better.",

You don't get that sort of language in John Lewis, I told myself using that handy silent inner voice. Possibly because staff at the latter aren't alienated but have a stake in their company's wellbeing, I added silently. It was then that I realised HMV was doomed.</p> <p>When I was working in Paris in 2000, Marks &amp; Spencer announced it was closing all its French branches. \"Where am I going to get my chicken tikka masalas from now,\" wailed a French colleague at the time, possibly in French. Sheez, I thought, is that what the revolutionary spirit of 1789 and 1968 has come to? But there was a twist. There were demonstrations outside the doomed Boulevard Haussmann demanding that M&amp;S stay open to supply Parisians with teabags and Rich Tea biscuits. They refused to accept that capitalist dictates could trample their cherished, though crazy, lifestyle choices. And then, a few years later, M&amp;S returned to France as if to show that their protest was worthwhile. Which, perhaps, it was.</p> <p>There are similar Gallic protests today <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20965566. http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/04/virgin-france-flagship-shutdown-paris\" title=\"\">over the closure of Virgin's megastores across France</a>. What's more, Aur\u00e9lie Filippetti, France's culture minister, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20944909\" title=\"\">recently railed against online retailers</a> who \"completely escape any kind of fair competition, because they don't pay the same taxes as the others, being based elsewhere than in France\". Filippetti clearly means Amazon, and those other globalised retailers of MP3 files who are rendering Virgin and the largest French music store, Fnac, obsolete. The same point could be made by our culture minister, too. Just don't expect the latter to happen any time soon.</p> <p>It's thanks to such online retailers, recession and austerity policies that we're experiencing one of the few booms in recent years; namely, a nostalgia boom, as well-known stores curl up and die, leaving us with memories of ostensibly happier times. That said, there's something pitiful about feeling nostalgic over the death of a favourite shop. It's sad we're so consumerist that our most poignant memories are bound up with retailing experiences. Surely any warm glow we might feel about HMV nostalgia deserves dousing with the news that <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/1038182/hmv-collapse-gift-cards-and-vouchers-invalid\" title=\"\">gift vouchers some bought at the shop over Christmas are now invalid</a>. Why should we feel nostalgic about the demise of an excrescence of capitalism? What are we going to feel nostalgic about next? Cholera? When Ikea closes in the near future (as, please God, it will), will I be tweeting my nostalgic feelings about its contribution to extending allen keys and misery worldwide? Just shoot me now.</p> <p>Stewart Lee satirised lame consumerist nostalgia in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_78_2d85YQ\" title=\"\">an observational bit</a> about that week in the run-up to Christmas 2008, when Woolworths, MFI and Zavvi all closed. At least they left us with some lovely memories, didn't they? he joked. Remember those lovely sweets at Woolworths pick-n-mix? \"Not like today's sweets with knives in them and Aids,\" Lee said.</p> <p>Lee's point here (and it's always nice to have a joke explained to you, isn't it?) is not just that a nostalgia premised on the lie-dream of shopping is degrading, but also that venerating the past over the present, or positing an unrepeatable golden age, and that modern life is rubbish, is nuts.</p> <p>Lee is doubtless right, but I still remember that afternoon I bought Bowie's Heroes for 75p from Reddingtons Rare Records by the underpass to Birmingham's inner ring road. It jumped a bit on V-2 Schneider when I played it yesterday, but it still is bound up with a sense of loss. <a href=\"http://www.reddingtonsrarerecords.co.uk/dannyshop.htm\" title=\"\">Reddingtons is now only online</a>, the inner ring road doesn't exist, nor does the foul subway under it, and I still can't play the intro to Joe the Lion. Why is all this so painful?</p> <p>\"Music is a very potent trigger of nostalgia,\" says <a href=\"http://www.southampton.ac.uk/psychology/about/staff/timw.page\" title=\"\">Dr Tim Wildschut</a>, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Southampton. \"Music shops may therefore be associated with strong nostalgic memories.\" Wildschut, an expert on <a href=\"http://www.southampton.ac.uk/nostalgia/materials/\" title=\"\">the bittersweet emotion of nostalgia</a>, has constructed one of my favourite scales of all time \u2013 namely, the Southampton Nostalgia Scale. His work helps explain why we feel more upset about the closure of Our Price, Tower Records, Virgin Megastores, Zavvi, MVC, Music Zone, Andy's, Border's and Woolworths, than, say, Comet. OK, maybe not Zavvi. We grew up with those stores and the music we bought from them, and when they go, just possibly, a little of ourselves dies too. We may feel like that about iTunes one day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-402461786\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/1/15/1358272421371/A-Comet-store-010.jpg\" alt=\"A Comet store\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comet: doesn\u2019t come as high on the nostalgia scale as, say, Woolworths or Tower Records Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Happily, though, for psychologists nostalgia is not just a negative emotion, nor one that necessarily involves wallowing in the past. Wildschut argues that it can be a powerful mood booster. It's a thought echoed by <a href=\"http://www.luc.edu/psychology/facultystaff/bryant_f.shtml\" title=\"\">Chicago psychologist Fred Bryant</a>. \"Reminiscence can give you a sense of being rooted, a sense of meaning and purpose \u2013 instead of being blown around by the whims of everyday life,\" says Bryant. In an MP3 world, then, how soothing to recall the era of vinyl or, failing that, of the CD. The risk, of course, is that nostalgia gives you a sense of being rooted in a better past rather than an unbearable present. Because while the present \u2013 MP3s, corporate tax evasion, capitalism at its most venal, the wanton destruction of the cherished high street \u2013 may be hideous, the past wasn't any better.</p> <p>Just before filing this piece, I played my dad's old LP of Ogdon and Lucas performing Mozart's sonata for two pianos in D major. It sounded good, but I'm sure a remastered download would sound better.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Goldman Sachs backs down from delayed bonus tax plan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs has been forced into an embarrassing climbdown from plans to allow its highly paid bankers to avoid the 50% top rate of tax, following public intervention by Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King and pressure from the government. But the Wall Street firm is expected to spark a fresh row over City bonuses on Wednesday by revealing that its bankers have enjoyed a 10% pay rise when it announces profits for 2012. Goldman was already facing condemnation about proposals to defer bonuses until after 6 April, when the top rate of income tax falls to 45% from 50%, when King waded in. The Bank of England governor told MPs he regarded such attempts as \"depressing\". Further pressure was being exerted behind the scenes by the Treasury minister, Sajid Javid, who spoke to Goldman bankers to seek assurances that the bonuses from 2009, 2010 and 2011 would not be delayed. King told the Treasury select committee: \"I find it a bit depressing that people who earn so much seem to think that it's even more exciting to adjust the timing of it to get the benefit of the lower tax rate \u2026which they will benefit from in the long run to a very great extent knowing this must have an impact on the rest of society, when even now it is the rest of society which is suffering most from the consequences of the financial crisis.\" The phone call between Javid and Goldman bankers had been scheduled late on Monday night and took place on Tuesday afternoon just after the bank's remuneration committee met to discuss bonuses for 2012 and pulled any plan to delay bonuses. The bank's pay committee was meeting ahead of the bank's full-year results, after which staff will be informed of their bonuses, amid forecasts that the firm will defy the downward trend in the City and raise average payments. Sanford Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz predicted average pay per employee at Goldman would rise from around \u00a3238,000 to \u00a3260,000 after a wave of redundancies. The shadow Treasury minister, Chris Leslie, predicted that the bonus season being launched by Goldman this week will be \"very lucrative for thousands of bankers\" as a result of the cut to the top tax rate. JP Morgan, hit by the London Whale trading affair, also reports on Wednesday amid expectations its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, will be docked part of his bonuses for the $6bn (\u00a33.7bn) of losses which this week sparked regulatory intervention on both sides of the Atlantic. European banks, including the bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland, do not publish their results for another month. RBS is facing additional pressure to restrain bonuses as it braces for a fine \u2013 possibly \u00a3500m \u2013 for rigging the Libor interest rate. The government's private approach to Goldman contrasted with Prime Minister David Cameron's description of the tax affairs of comedian Jimmy Carr as \"morally wrong\" last summer. David Hillman, a spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, which lobbies for a financial transaction tax, urged the government to \"get a grip\" on the financial sector at the start of the bonus season. Lord Oakeshott, former Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, said that if Goldman wanted to keep working for the government on major products the bank could not \"spit in taxpayers' faces\". \"It's high time they behaved like good citizens, not barrow boys,\" Oakeshott said. Michael Cohrs, who sits on the Bank of England's new financial policy committee, the body charged with stopping systemic risks from overwhelming the financial system, told the Treasury select committee that the government had \"probably\" overpaid for its stakes in RBS and Lloyds during the 2008 banking crisis. He added that the taxpayer was unlikely to make a profit, even though US taxpayers have made a profit on bailouts across the Atlantic. Banks are already being told to establish how much more capital they need. When asked for a \"ballpark\" figure for RBS and Lloyds, Cohrs said it was a \"big number\" that should not be made public as \"it will spin out of control in the journalist community\".",

They have a point: as a Brighton resident, I'm more concerned about the uncertain future of the tiny Borderline Records in North Laine than I am about the local HMV, because I love shopping in the former, and the last time I went into the latter, I came out wearing the expression of existential despair I normally reserve for Sunday visits to Ikea. And yet I can't help feeling sad at the news that HMV has gone into administration, apparently brought to disaster by a failure to keep up with a changing market. Online, you can find a blog by an advertising executive who worked with HMV for 25 years, in which he claims the company's former MD remarked in 2002 that \"downloadable music is just a fad\", which if it's true may well be music retail's own equivalent of \"groups with guitars are on their way out, Mr Epstein\".

If you're looking for an example of how online retailers have undercut the high street, one of them is offering said album on CD for the same price I paid for it 32 years ago. It didn't seem like visiting a branch of a vast faceless corporate monolith. In fact, it seemed like a portal into a slightly illicit, transgressive alternate universe. The walls at the rear were covered in punk 7\" singles. There were picture sleeves and coloured vinyl pressings and imports. There was a single called 99% Is Shit by The Cash Pussies, which I remember boggling at: aged nine, it seemed utterly inconceivable that someone had made a record with the word \"shit\" in the title. For some reason, I can also vividly recall seeing an import single featuring Malcolm McLaren singing You Need Hands: presumably some lunatic at a continental record label had looked at the soundtrack of the Sex Pistols' film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle and concluded that the track with most commercial potential was the one that featured their manager tunelessly bellowing his way through the old Max Bygraves number.

The only way you'd lose an hour in there now was trying to find an album that you couldn't find cheaper elsewhere, or indeed trying to find any albums, in among all the other stuff HMV had started to flog in an attempt at staving off the inevitable: the range of music on offer seemed to continually narrow over recent years. One story has the rot setting in with a centralised buying system, which saved money, uniformed stock and ensured valuable wall space would no longer be taken up with The Cash Pussies' 99% Is Shit \u2013 or similar \u2013 just because someone who worked there liked it. The truth may be that the way people consume music has changed utterly and irrevocably from 20 years ago.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A decision by Walmart to hire 100,000 veterans over the next five years has been welcomed by some former military figures but also sparked warnings by others concerned over the giant retailer's reputation for low-wage jobs. In a speech on Tuesday, which was widely leaked ahead of time, Walmart's chief executive of US operations Bill Simon said the company was making the move due to the qualities that former military personnel would bring as employees. \"Hiring a veteran can be one of the best business decisions you make. Veterans have a record of performance under pressure. They're quick learners and team players. They are leaders with discipline, training, and a passion for service. There is a seriousness and sense of purpose that the military instils, and we need it today more than ever,\" Simon said in a speech delivered at a National Retail Federation conference in New York. The news comes after a difficult 2012 for the firm in which it faced a high-profile attempt by some employees to organise for better pay and conditions, a foreign corruption scandal in Mexico and elsewhere overseas and a tragically lethal fire at an unsafe factory in Bangladesh which made clothing for its supply chain. However, the latest news brought immediate praise from the White House. \"Walmart is setting a groundbreaking example for the private sector to follow,\" said a statement from first lady Michelle Obama, who has made improving the conditions of military families one of her signature causes. The Department of Veterans Affairs also welcomed the scheme. \"[We] commend Walmart for their leadership and strong commitment to hire veterans,\" a spokesman said. That praise was matched by some veterans themselves. Former marine Zachary Iscol, who has set up a company called Hire Purpose that helps veterans find jobs, said the Walmart scheme was \"great news\". He added: \"There is a business case to be made for hiring the best and brightest of Americans. Veterans are dedicated, tireless and can perform in a team as well as individuals.\" But other voices raised concerns. Walmart employs more than 1.3 million people in the United States but many experts say that it pays low wages, often employs people for too few hours to qualify for meaningful health benefits and is hostile to any form of union organisation among its staff. \"Obviously this is a good move that an employer wants to hire veterans. Our concern is that the jobs might be low wage and not offer enough health benefits,\" said Paul Sullivan, a board member for veterans' rights group Veterans for Common Sense. Sullivan said that veterans, especially those who might have suffered mental issues or physical injury, needed top quality jobs with adequate health insurance for their needs. He expressed a concern that Walmart might be more concerned with scoring some good publicity for its operations, rather than changing its frequently criticised employment practises. \"I am concerned this is a public relations exercise to make the company look good. Veterans need fair wages, union representation and a job that offers a career, not just a low-wage position,\" Sullivan said. Walmart certainly would welcome a PR success. Last year's Black Friday \u2013 the busiest shopping day of the year in the US, which comes right after the Thanksgiving holiday in November \u2013 saw protests by union-backed group OUR Walmart at scores of stores across the US. It has also faced allegations of widespread abuses, unsafe working conditions and wage theft in outsourced elements of its US-based supply chain in southern California and Illinois. But perhaps the worst PR hit of the year was the lethal fire in the Tazreen factory in Bangladesh which saw 112 local workers die. Though the factory was not meant to feed items into the Walmart supply chain due to being unsafe, documents unearthed after the blaze showed that it had been doing so. It also emerged that Walmart, along with other foreign companies, had blocked a bid to improve conditions in Bangladeshi factories in 2011, including fire safety measures.",

      "body": "<p>The grocers Ocado and the Co-operative Group were buoyed by a surge in internet shopping over the festive season.</p> <p>The Co-op, which is owned by more than 6 million consumers and claims to be the fifth-biggest food retailer in Britain, said it benefitted from customers shopping online at rival stores, then making last-minute visits to their local Co-op. Christmas Eve was its busiest day of the year, with takings of more than \u00a335m.</p> <p>Like-for-sales at Co-op's 2,800-strong chain grew by 2.2% over the three weeks to 5January. Most of its stores are small, local shops, which saw like-for-like sales rise by 5.5% over the same period.</p> <p>Matt Piner, an analyst at retail consultancy Conlumino, said: \"We've seen online do very well over Christmas for food and grocery. Co-op doesn't tap into that directly but it means people will stop into smaller stores on their way home.\"</p> <p>Co-op also noticed a trend for customers hosting parties at home, rather than going to pubs and restaurants, as Britons cut back on spending. That drove sales of champagne up by 29% and its own-label party food 53% higher.</p> <p>Co-op's chief executive, Peter Marks, said: \"Against a difficult economic environment, customers were keen to celebrate Christmas and the new year with their friends and family.</p> <p>\"By continuing to focus on quality and value, the Co-Operative, with our stores conveniently located in the communities, helped them do just that.\"</p> <p>Marks announced his retirement last summer. He will be replaced by Euan Sutherland, former head of B&amp;Q, in May.</p> <p>Ocado also had a merry Christmas, with sales up by 14% in the six weeks to 6 January.

      "bodyText": "The grocers Ocado and the Co-operative Group were buoyed by a surge in internet shopping over the festive season. The Co-op, which is owned by more than 6 million consumers and claims to be the fifth-biggest food retailer in Britain, said it benefitted from customers shopping online at rival stores, then making last-minute visits to their local Co-op. Christmas Eve was its busiest day of the year, with takings of more than \u00a335m. Like-for-sales at Co-op's 2,800-strong chain grew by 2.2% over the three weeks to 5January. Most of its stores are small, local shops, which saw like-for-like sales rise by 5.5% over the same period. Matt Piner, an analyst at retail consultancy Conlumino, said: \"We've seen online do very well over Christmas for food and grocery. Co-op doesn't tap into that directly but it means people will stop into smaller stores on their way home.\" Co-op also noticed a trend for customers hosting parties at home, rather than going to pubs and restaurants, as Britons cut back on spending. That drove sales of champagne up by 29% and its own-label party food 53% higher. Co-op's chief executive, Peter Marks, said: \"Against a difficult economic environment, customers were keen to celebrate Christmas and the new year with their friends and family. \"By continuing to focus on quality and value, the Co-Operative, with our stores conveniently located in the communities, helped them do just that.\" Marks announced his retirement last summer. He will be replaced by Euan Sutherland, former head of B&amp;Q, in May. Ocado also had a merry Christmas, with sales up by 14% in the six weeks to 6 January. The high-end internet grocer said shoppers had spent more per shop compared with the previous festive period.

It does mean that its AAA rating is under quite significant pressure.</p> <p>If we were, following the budget, to see that the debt is going up even higher than we currently project and is going to peak even later than we currently forecast, then that would put a lot of pressure in terms of the UK AAA rating because essentially, on a very broad measure, it would mean that the UK government is projecting a debt level of 100% of GDP.

      "bodyText": "And on that note, I'd better scarper. The main eurozone news today came early, with Germany's GDP data (see 8.34am onwards for details ...9.15am and 5.26pm for reaction) There were also: \u2022 Sir Mervyn King's caution over European banking union \u2022 A warning for the US and Spain from Fitch ...and then one for Britain too \u2022 protests in Madrid as Spain courted international investers \u2022 While in Greece, the political fallout after recent firebomb attacks and shootings continued \u2022 In Ireland, former president Mary Robinson was upbeat about the future, but the current government is demanding a tough new pay deal \u2022 And who hung those flags next to each other? Back tomorrow. Thanks, and goodnight! City experts are already tucking the shroud around Britain's AAA rating, following Fitch's comments (see 5.46pm) If I had to bet (and it has been known - not always successfully either), I'd wager that the UK clings onto its AAA rating until after the Budget in March, but not much longer.... Missed this earlier, but Andrew Sparrow didn't. Fitch warned that Britain's AAA rating is increasingly shaky. Speaking to the BBC's World At One, David Fitch (who'd had a busy day) said: There is increasing concern that the fiscal consolidation is happening more slowly, that the economy isn't recovering as quickly as we had hoped. This does leave the UK quite vulnerable either to a worsening of the situation in Europe or some kind of shock coming from the United States or elsewhere. It does mean that its AAA rating is under quite significant pressure. If we were, following the budget, to see that the debt is going up even higher than we currently project and is going to peak even later than we currently forecast, then that would put a lot of pressure in terms of the UK AAA rating because essentially, on a very broad measure, it would mean that the UK government is projecting a debt level of 100% of GDP. In our view that is not really consistent with the UK retaining the AAA rating. Here's a link to the full interview: Bold call from Capital Economics this evening - they expect Germany's economy to shrink this year. Here's a snippet from a research note just issued, from analyst Ben May: Despite modest rises in household and government spending, domestic demand fell last year. Although export growth was weaker than in 2011, import growth was even more subdued. As a result, net trade boosted GDP by 1.1%. During 2013, we expect further falls in domestic demand and a drag from net trade to prompt the economy to contract by around 0.5% \u2013 well below the consensus forecast for a 0.8% gain. As a reminder, the Berlin government had expected growth of 1% this year but is now expected to halve it, while the Bundesbank expects growth of just 0.4% during the year. Germany's stock market has fallen today, following the news that its economy shank in the last quarter. Other markets were mixed. Here's the closing prices: FTSE 100: up 9 points at 6117, + 0.15% German DAX: down 53 points at 7675, -0.69% French CAC: down 10 points at 3697, -0.29% Spanish IBEX: down 31 points at 8601, -0.36% Italian FTSE MIB: up 76 points at 17467, +0.44% Great story here -- The European Central Bank has reacted rather coolly to the suggestion that Mario Draghi might become Italy's next president. Silvio Berlusconi (who else?) made the suggestion on Italian morning TV, declaring: Absolutely yes, if there is a majority that proposes (Draghi)..., I would vote for him. A vacancy is imminent -- Giorgio Napolitano is due to relinquish the presidency in May. But Draghi also has one presidency to deal with, and the ECB isn't prepared to wave goodbye to the man who saved the euro. A spokesman told Reuters that: Mario Draghi's term of office as President of the ECB is eight years until 31 October, 2019. He is committed to serve his term fully. So, perhaps he could be president then? One to revisit (you'll all here for the rest of the decade, right?) Albert Edwards, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's notoriously bearish strategist, has been giving a presentation in London this afternoon with his team. One of our favourite fund managers, @pawelmorski, is there, and tweets the highlights -- including the surprising news that Edwards reckons some stocks are actually cheap! SocGen are also worried about inflation.... Although when we say 'inflation'.... There's more in PM's timeline... There have been protests in Madrid today, as the Spanish government tries to woo international business people. The event, called \"Spain, Investors Day\", is designed to allow Spanish banks to meet with potential new partners. Held at the Ritz Hotel, the event was opened by Prince Felipe of Spain. But outside, demonstrators gathered to protest against Spanish banks' for evicting homeowners who can no longer meet their mortgage payments as the country's recession and jobless crisis rumbles on. As this photo shows, dozens of members of the Mortgage Victims' Platform clashed with police: While inside, the task of pitching investors was underway: And some breaking news in Greece where the finance ministry has announced emergency aid to boost heating supplies for schools, reports Helena Smith Following a cabinet meeting chaired by the prime minister the finance ministry announced it would be rushing through \u20ac7m in aid for the \u201cexclusive purpose\u201d of heating state-run schools in snow-hit central and northern Greece. Regular readers will recall that funding for heating oil supplies in schools had been cut by as much as 60% as successive governments attempted to meet internationally-mandated budget targets. Last month, teacher unions had threatened to cancel classes saying they would \u201chave to suspend lessons because of the cold weather\u201d. With the debt-stricken country braced for another cold snap, the finance ministry appears to have finally heeded their warning saying it will disburse the aid to meet the heating requirements of schools in areas hit by \u201cextreme weather phenomena.\u201d A growing number of cash-strapped families have resorted to burning wood rather than paying for oil -- so many, in fact, that air pollution in cities of Greece has surged. Helena continues: Acutely aware of brewing social discontent over belt-tightening measures, prime minister Antonis Samaras told cabinet ministers he would make \u201cthe war against joblessness\u201d his top priority this year \u201cespecially among our youth.\u201d Greece now has the highest unemployment rate in the EU with joblessness among the younger generation at a record 55%. The vast majority of those affected are female with two out of three women under the age of 25 being unable to find work. Over in Greece our correspondent Helena Smith says prime minister Antonis Samaras will hold a crisis meeting to discuss the spate of attacks that has rocked the country in recent days (see Monday's blog for details) Helena writes: The Greek prime minister\u2019s office announced that Samaras will hold talks with his junior partners at 6pm local time (4pm GMT). With police having failed to identity any of the perpetrators so far, the meeting comes amid mounting concern over politically-motivated violence hijacking the government\u2019s reform efforts. In less than a week, officials and state-employed media workers have all been targeted mostly by makeshift fire bombs that have exploded outside their homes. The violence peaked on Monday when an unidentified assailant sprayed the headquarters of Samaras\u2019 centre-right New Democracy party with gunfire following 17 other attacks on political party offices nationwide. Aides say tonight\u2019s talks will focus exclusively on the violence. \u201cThere is a lot of nervousness in the government ranks,\u201d said one insider. \u201cFor many, this is its biggest test so far.\u201d Coalition officials have blamed anti-establishment groups for the attacks, claiming perpetrators have been emboldened by the tacit support they say they've been given by the main opposition radical left Syriza party. Meanwhile, Helena says, the party has virulently denied the accusation with Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras personally calling Samaras to express his outrage over the assault on New Democracy\u2019s central offices. \"This is certainly a dangerous escalation of terrorist attacks of blind violence, which are completely condemned by Syriza,\" said Panos Skourletis the party\u2019s spokesman. Some leftists have claimed that the violence is a deliberate ploy to divert attention from rising levels of discontent over unpopular austerity measures the fragile alliance has agreed to in return for EU-IMF rescue funds. Fury is expected to grow as the conservative-led coalition applies ever more draconian pay cuts and tax hikes in the coming weeks. I guess we'll know more about the motives behind the attack if any of the perpetrators are found, following the counter-terrorism work yesterday: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, argues that today's weak German GDP figures show that Europe's largest economy is suffering from its reliance on exports and investment. He writes: Like Britain, Germany needs to rebalance its economy. But whereas the UK tends to live beyond its means, consuming and importing too much, Germany has the opposite problem. The sharp slowdown in 2012 growth shows just how vulnerable Europe's biggest economy is to events in the rest of the world. More here: Germany's export model faces reality check The Bank of Portugal has, like the German government (see 10.14am), admitted that its GDP forecasts are too optimistic. It now expects the Portuguese economy to shrink by 1.9%, not the 1.6% previously. It blamed \"less favourable global growth\" and slower export growth. Like Berlin, it still hopes for a bounceback in 2014, and predicts growth of +1.6%. However, it also warned that any \"additional austerity measures\" might sink that. To mark Ireland assuming the Presidency of the EU every flag (bar one.... see below) of union has been erected along the river Liffey in Dublin. And look who are flying side-by-side..... Henry McDonald explains: Someone with a sense of humour has placed the Irish Tricolour right beside the Greek national flag. A case of Europe's \"poster child\" alongside, at least in German eyes, the bad boys and girls of the EU! In the background is the brutalist 80s construct, the Irish Central Bank which is the workplace of the Troika of the IMF, ECB and EU who make sure Irish fiscal policies are to the liking of the global financial system.' One flag appears to have gone missing, though, the United Kingdom's. Henry adds: And the one and only flag missing from along Dublin's quays is none other than the Union Jack - an emblem much in the news north of the border where loyalists riot because it only flies on 18 designated days atop Belfast City Hall. Its absence here in Dublin will undoubtedly be duly noted in Northern Ireland! Indeed! There's been a lot of talk of Brexit, but it's not actually happened.... Rating agency Fitch has issued warning blasts at the Spanish and US governments this morning. On Spain, Fitch warned that the country could see its rating cut even if it manages to avoid seeking international help. The problem, explained Fitch's David Riley, is that the Spanish economy is so weak. If this time next year the expectation is for another 1.5 or 2 percent contraction in the economy and unemployment getting towards 30 percent, it's very bad times. Spain is currently in the curious position of not needing to seek a bailout because the European Central Bank has pledged to support it through unlimited bond purchases if called upon, thus pushing its bond yields down. Riley, though, warned that this won't be enough unless Spain's economy improves (which reminds me of Mario Draghi's comments last week that eurozone leaders must seize the opportunity presented by the current calm). Fitch currently rates Spain just two notches above Junk, at BBB (with a negative rating), so a downgrade could cost the country its investment grade. And on the US, Fitch warned that its credit rating (currently AAA) would be at risk if Washington politicians cannot reach an agreement on its debt ceiling. Crucially, Fitch said that the rating could be cut even if America managed to keep meeting its obligations and avoided a default. Failure to hammer out a deal in time would be enough to possibly trigger a downgrade. Here's a flavour of the statement: The U.S. 'AAA' status is underpinned by the country's relative economic dynamism and potential, diminishing financial sector risks, respect for the rule of law and property rights, as well as the exceptional financing flexibility that accrues from the global benchmark status of U.S. Treasury securities and the dollar. These fundamental credit strengths are being eroded by the large, albeit steadily declining, structural budget deficit and high and rising public debt. In the absence of an agreed and credible medium-term deficit reduction plan that would be consistent with sustaining the economic recovery and restoring confidence in the long-run sustainability of U.S. public finances, the current Negative Outlook on the 'AAA' rating is likely to be resolved with a downgrade later this year even if another debt ceiling crisis is averted. Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, has warned that Europe's push towards banking union will not, on its own, save the eurozone. Appearing with senior colleagues before the Treasury Committee, King warned that Europe will only be on really solid ground when it has found \"a way of fixing the current account and trade deficits\" within the single currency region. King said: Banking union is the answer [to the crisis] only in as much that it allows countries whose banks need refinancing to get their banks recapitalised by other members of the currency union. King added that European Central Bank is not able to reshape the eurozone to guarantee its future: It cannot...either move to a transfer union, or take effective measures to change the competitiveness of countries. The Bank of England group also didn't seem too impressed by Europe's push towards banking union -- there was a long pause after they were asked for views on it. And Andrew Bailey, the executive director and managing director of the Prudential Business Unit, was blunt that the scheme needs to include full insurance for savers. Back to Ireland where, in a bid to drive down its huge national deficit, the Irish coalition government is seeking to save an extra one billion euros from its public sector. This means reviewing its national wage agreement with public service unions hammered out in Dublin's Croke Park stadium - the home of Gaelic sports in Ireland - back in 2010. Henry McDonald writes: The Fine Gael-Labour administration insists that will press ahead with cuts in public pay of up to 7% even if talks with the unions break down. Unions are accusing the government of breaking the agreement which was meant to last until 2014. Some union leaders are predicting that the talks will fail because their membership won't endorse changes to their pay and conditions, which they describe as \"draconian\". Admitting that the government faces union opposition to changing the agreement, Brendan Howlin, the Minister in charge of Public Expenditure and Reform in the Republic, has said \"it won't be an easy task to drill down the content and get to the detail in a limited time frame.\" Critics of the Croke Park deal claim that it has thrown tax payers' money at a bloated public sector and protected civil servants from the chill winds of the recession in Ireland. They charge that there is no EU state that has so insulated its state employees, their pay and pensions from the age of austerity. At the start of this year Irish's deficit was still \u20ac14.9bn. The Croke Park Agreement has bought industrial peace in Ireland but at an enormous cost to the public purse, Henry explains: Signed between the trade union movement and the previous Fianna Fail led government it secured the following: A freeze on strikes in the public sector. A moratorium on compulsory lay offs in the state services. Co-operation on finding efficiencies in the state run enterprises and the civil service. No pay cuts. So far, the Fine Gael-Labour coalition that replaced the last administration has honoured this deal with the unions. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight believes the rise in the eurozone trade surplus (see 10.31am) suggests its economy didn't shrink as much as feared in the last quarter (despite Germany's contraction). This lifts hopes that improving global demand will help the Eurozone exit recession early on in 2013. However, Eurozone exporters will be hoping that the euro does not make further gains after climbing to an 11-month high against the US dollar this week Better news for the eurozone \u2013 it posted a larger-than-expected trade surplus in November. The euro area enjoyed a trade surplus of \u20ac13.7bn in November, compared with under \u20ac5bn a year ago. While imports were flat, exports were 5% higher. We don't have a breakdown by country for November.... ... but for January-October, Germany posted a trade surplus of \u20ac158bn, up from \u20ac129bn in the same period in 2011. Italy, though, showed the biggest improvement \u2013 a surplus of \u20ac6.6bn from a deficit of \u20ac25.3bn the previous year. Officials at Germany's economy ministry have conceded that growth this year will be much lower than the 1% official target -- less than half, in fact. Reuters reports: The German government expects economic growth of 0.4% in 2013, accelerating to 1.6% in 2014, an economy ministry official told Reuters on Tuesday. Add this year's +0.7% expansion, and you're looking at three years of pretty low growth... Another successful bond sale for Spain --- it's Treasury department just sold almost \u20ac5.8bn (more than its maximum target) of short-term debt at much lower borrowing costs. Here's the details: \u2022 \u20ac3.25bn of 12-month bills at an average yield (interest rate) of 1.472%, compared with 2.556% last month \u2022 \u20ac2.51bn of 18-month bills at an average yield of 1.687%, down from 2.778%. Further proof that traders are more confident about the eurozone.... ...as is the latest survey from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, which shows that optimism is racing ahead. Over in Ireland Mary Robinson, the former Irish President and close colleague of Nelson Mandela, is trying to cheer recession stricken Ireland up by predicting the country will emerge stronger than ever from the crisis. From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: \"I think Ireland has benefited from a very tough lesson. We recognise that this is the toughest time we've been through in modern Ireland. It's hurting people terribly, but we will come through stronger and I hope we will come through fairer, with a real sense of what Ireland itself can achieve,\" Robinson stated. The ex President acknowledged that Ireland was going through \"another wave\" of emigration but this could be used to the Republic's advantage. She told students at University College Galway that these emigrants \"know that they want to come back and be more equipped for the modern Ireland\". Robinson who is one of the so-called global 'Elders' along with Mandela added: \"We need to be a country that these young people want to come back to and that's the challenge for the rest of us.\" And here's the raw facts: According to the Central Statistics Office in Dublin, 87,100 people left Ireland from April 2011-April 2012, a rise of 7,000 compared to the previous year. In the UK, inflation came in at 2.7% (CPI) for the third month running, largely as expected. That's the (joint) highest level since May. Utility prices continued to drive the cost of living up - they rose by 3.9% year-on-year. Some early reaction to the German GDP data from Twitter: Economists say today's German GDP data (see 8.34am) is disappointing, but not alarming, Here's some early reaction (cribbed from Reuters): J\u00f6rg Kramer of Commerzbank The drop in equipment investment in 2012 draws attention. That is all the more significant that firms raised their exports again. Obviously firms have held back because they are uncertain about the (euro zone) debt crisis. But this has clearly ebbed. J\u00f6rg Zeuner of KFGW German growth was well above the European average in 2012 despite a contraction in fourth-quarter economic output. I expect a significant recovery in 2013 after a weak first quarter. Andreas Schuele of Dekaban Growth as low as 0.7 percent is, at first sight, disappointing... But if you take the tough environment in the euro zone and weakness in growth markets into account, one can be quite pleased after all. A German government source has told Reuters that Angela Merkel's cabinet will decide tomorrow whether to revise its forecast for 2013 GDP growth down from 1% (perhaps to the +0.5% that Handeslblett predicted this morning) Here's the details of how Germany's economy performed in 2012, showing a sharp fall in investment - but decent growth in exports: GDP: + 0.7% Private consumption: +0.8% Equipment investment: -4.4% Building investment: -1.1% Other investment: +3.2% Exports: + 4.1% Imports: 2.3% Good morning, and welcome to another day of rolling coverage of events across the eurozone, and elsewhere in the world economy. Germany's economy has shrunk in the last quarter, according to new data that is likely to force the Berlin government to slash its economic growth forecasts for this year. The German Statistics Office reported this morning that Germany's economy contracted by 0.5% between October and December, as the financial crisis hit Eurozone's powerhouse economy. This means that Germany grew by just 0.7% during 2012, a sharp slowdown that does not bode well for 2013. Economists had expected annual growth of 0.8%, so today's number is slightly weaker. Even +0.8% would have meant \"a significant contraction in Q4\". according to CMC's Michael Hewson. In 2011 Germany had expanded by 3%, while in 2010 it posted growth of 4.2% - the best results since East and West Germany were re-unified. The data, just released, may deflate some of the optimism that has been flowing around the financial markets in recent weeks. Or investors may decide that it's all history, and cling to their confidence that the crisis is abating. The key question now is whether Germany's government will slash its forecast for growth in 2013. It currently forecasts a 1% increase in GDP, but business newspaper Handeslblatt reports this morning that it will halve it, to just 0.5%. Plausible, given the Bundesbank has already warned Germany would expand by a meagre 0.4% next year. But politically unpalatable. I'll be tracking the reaction to the German GDP data this morning. We also have new inflation due for the UK (9.30am GMT) and the eurozone (10am GMT), along with the latest political developments in Italy ahead of next month's elections. I'll also have an eye on Greece, and Ireland where the government is trying to hammer out a national wage deal with its unions.",

    "webTitle": "HMV record chain was beset by digital downloads and cheap DVDs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If HMV was going to fail it was always going to be after a Christmas sales surge, when the tills were as full of cash as they were ever going to be and when the shelves were depleted of stock. Such timings are critical to creditors, and unprecedented January sale discounts were a clear sign that the end was nigh. It remains to be seen whether the administrators Deloitte can find a buyer for a part or all of the business. Looking back at the company's recent history it appears it was perhaps a minor miracle that HMV remained a going concern for so long. Take a look at this share price chart. Stock market investors twigged two years ago that the business contained next to no value for shareholders. Indeed, as far back as June 2011 HMV's chief executive at the time, Simon Fox, said the business had some way to go before it had a \"full, credible, equity story\" for shareholders. This, despite big revisions to its borrowing agreements with Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. In 2011, in the spring and early summer, these two banks, both partly state owned, could have pulled the plug. They did not. But nor, quite rightly, did they re-capitalise the business to rude health. In fact, from that moment onwards HMV was to limp on as a corporate creature all but controlled by its debt commitments. A zombie. Wind the clock forward a year and, in the wake of the busy Christmas 2011 trading spell, the company was again on the brink. The two banks' deliberated: should they call in HMV's unsustainable loans, or should they \"extend and pretend\"? At this point, clearly worried suppliers, such as film houses and record labels, rode in to join the rescue party. If RBS and Lloyds were prepared again to loosen HMV's lending terms, then the DVD and CD suppliers would take on some of the ailing retailers solvency risk. A backroom deal was done. Shareholders were told little of it, but that didn't matter; they were effectively out of the picture already. Asked if the intervention of suppliers meant an equity story was finally resurfacing, Fox was grim-faced: \"I don't thing we can quite say that.\" Like hapless souls stuck in the first circle of Dante's inferno, without hope, HMV shareholders were to live on in desire. HMV's two lenders issued a joint statement on Tuesday noting they had \"provided significant support to HMV over the past two years, as it has sought to reshape and restructure its business in the face of extremely difficult trading conditions\". Sounding like corporate undertakers, they sombrely reflected: \"Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of management, lenders and suppliers, it has not proven possible to avoid a formal insolvency process.\" For now, few are asking whether two years of forbearance was in the best interests of these financially stretched banks, or indeed of their largest shareholder, the taxpayer. Small companies will gripe that they see little of this kind of tolerance from these and other lenders. Certainly, when the future of a high-profile, big employer is at stake the decision making of a state-owned bank looks to be, let's say, complex. In their hearts, who at RBS or Lloyds really thought a strategy of diversifying into faddish, outsized headphones was likely to offset the elemental forces stacking up against HMV's core business of DVD and CD sales? The growth of digital downloads, the recession and competition from supermarkets were all eroding its business performance. By far the biggest impact, however, was the explosion in popularity of mail order websites such as Play.com, Amazon, and Tesco.com. For almost a decade these companies exploited a loophole in EU tax rules to ship DVDs and CDs at VAT-free prices from the Channel Islands \u2013 thereby undercutting HMV. In 2005 HMV sought to copy the model, establishing a warehouse of its own on Guernsey. The ambition was to increase online sales to 20% of total sales in three years. They never got close, in part because Play.com poached HMV's top web executive, Stuart Rowe. Remarkably, whenever the Guardian wrote about the tax loophole damaging HMV's business, the company complained. Why were we reporting on these inconsequential matters? The Labour government ignored the issue also; it too attacked the Guardian's campaign against the VAT loophole. But George Osborne, the chancellor, did attempt to close it down last year, acknowledging in the Commons that the VAT-free Channel Islands trade, worth more than \u00a3500m a year, amounted to \"exploitation that has left our high-street music stores fighting a losing battle\". It wasn't until this measure had been announced that Fox, who has since departed to Trinity Mirror, finally spoke publicly to voice his frustrations about the disadvantages facing HMV stores as they tried to compete with offshore VAT-free websites. Despite a near monopoly in many towns, HMV stores were seeing sales slump year after year, even at paper-thin margins. Fox said: \"Unfortunately, [Osborne's] legislation closes down low value consignment relief [LVCR] only from the Channel Islands. It remains to be seen what our competitors will do, but undoubtedly there'll be a temptation to go to Switzerland or wherever \u2026 the closing of LVCR rules is a good thing, but the way it has been implemented doesn't necessarily solve anything.\" As the Guardian has reported recently, some large websites have quickly found ways to circumvent Osborne's crackdown on VAT avoidance. A quick search on the internet shows HMV.com, which has closed its Guernsey warehouse and returned its mail order operations to the UK, is regularly more expensive than other traders. Until this VAT avoidance is dealt with more firmly HMV's 240 high-street stores will stand little hope of a meaningful life after administration. The chancellor promised to act against other jurisdictions if the VAT-free sites relocated away from the Channel Islands. They are now calling his bluff. Will he respond?",

      "body": "<p>If HMV was going to fail it was always going to be after a Christmas sales surge, when the tills were as full of cash as they were ever going to be and when the shelves were depleted of stock.</p> <p>Such timings are critical to creditors, and unprecedented January sale discounts were a clear sign that the end was nigh.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the administrators Deloitte can find a buyer for a part or all of the business.</p> <p>Looking back at the company's recent history it appears it was perhaps a minor miracle that HMV remained a going concern for so long.</p> <p>Take a look at this <a href=\"http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=HMV.L#symbol=hmv.l;range=5y;compare=;indicator=volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;\" title=\"\">share price chart</a>. Stock market investors twigged two years ago that the business contained next to no value for shareholders.</p> <p>Indeed, as far back as June 2011 HMV's chief executive at the time, Simon Fox, said the business had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jan/19/hmv-calls-in-kpmg-debt-advisers\" title=\"\">some way to go before it had a \"full, credible, equity story\"</a> for shareholders.</p> <p>This, despite big revisions to its borrowing agreements with Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. In 2011, in the spring and early summer, these two banks, both partly state owned, could have pulled the plug. They did not. But nor, quite rightly, did they re-capitalise the business to rude health.</p> <p>In fact, from that moment onwards HMV was to limp on as a corporate creature all but controlled by its debt commitments. A zombie.</p> <p>Wind the clock forward a year and, in the wake of the busy Christmas 2011 trading spell, the company was again on the brink. The two banks' deliberated: should they call in HMV's unsustainable loans, or should they \"extend and pretend\"?</p> <p>At this point, clearly worried suppliers, such as film houses and record labels, rode in to join the rescue party.</p> <p>If RBS and Lloyds were prepared again to loosen HMV's lending terms, then the DVD and CD suppliers would take on some of the ailing retailers solvency risk. A backroom deal was done. Shareholders were told little of it, but that didn't matter; they were effectively out of the picture already.</p> <p>Asked if the intervention of suppliers meant an equity story was finally resurfacing, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jan/20/hmv-strikes-deal-with-suppliers?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Fox was grim-faced</a>: \"I don't thing we can quite say that.\"</p> <p>Like hapless souls stuck in the first circle of Dante's inferno, without hope, HMV shareholders were to live on in desire.</p> <p>HMV's two lenders issued a joint statement on Tuesday noting they had \"provided significant support to HMV over the past two years, as it has sought to reshape and restructure its business in the face of extremely difficult trading conditions\".</p> <p>Sounding like corporate undertakers, they sombrely reflected: \"Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of management, lenders and suppliers, it has not proven possible to avoid a formal insolvency process.\"</p> <p>For now, few are asking whether two years of forbearance was in the best interests of these financially stretched banks, or indeed of their largest shareholder, the taxpayer.</p> <p>Small companies will gripe that they see little of this kind of tolerance from these and other lenders. Certainly, when the future of a high-profile, big employer is at stake the decision making of a state-owned bank looks to be, let's say, complex.</p> <p>In their hearts, who at RBS or Lloyds really thought a strategy of diversifying into faddish, outsized headphones was likely to offset the elemental forces stacking up against HMV's core business of DVD and CD sales?</p> <p>The growth of digital downloads, the recession and competition from supermarkets were all eroding its business performance.</p> <p>By far the biggest impact, however, was the explosion in popularity of mail order websites such as Play.com, Amazon, and Tesco.com. For almost a decade these companies exploited a loophole in EU tax rules to ship DVDs and CDs at VAT-free prices from the Channel Islands \u2013 thereby undercutting HMV.</p> <p>In 2005 HMV sought to copy the model, establishing a warehouse of its own on Guernsey. The ambition was to increase online sales to 20% of total sales in three years. They never got close, in part because Play.com poached HMV's top web executive, Stuart Rowe.</p> <p>Remarkably, whenever the Guardian wrote about the tax loophole damaging HMV's business, the company complained. Why were we reporting on these inconsequential matters?</p> <p>The Labour government ignored the issue also; it too <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/feb/19/tax-free-cd-boom-casts-doubt-on-treasury-claims?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">attacked the Guardian's campaign</a> against the VAT loophole.</p> <p>But George Osborne, the chancellor, did attempt to close it down last year, acknowledging in the Commons that the VAT-free Channel Islands trade, worth more than \u00a3500m a year, amounted to \"exploitation that has left our high-street music stores fighting a losing battle\".</p> <p>It wasn't until this measure had been announced that Fox, who has since departed to Trinity Mirror, <a href=\"http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/hmv-slams-idiotic-offshore-tax-dodging/091203\" title=\"\">finally spoke publicly</a> to voice his frustrations about the disadvantages facing HMV stores as they tried to compete with offshore VAT-free websites.</p> <p>Despite a near monopoly in many towns, HMV stores were seeing sales slump year after year, even at paper-thin margins.</p> <p>Fox said: \"Unfortunately, [Osborne's] legislation closes down low value consignment relief [LVCR] only from the Channel Islands. It remains to be seen what our competitors will do, but undoubtedly there'll be a temptation to go to Switzerland or wherever \u2026 the closing of LVCR rules is a good thing, but the way it has been implemented doesn't necessarily solve anything.\"</p> <p>As the Guardian has reported recently, some large websites have quickly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/16/hut-avoid-vat-shipping-via-us?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">found ways to circumvent Osborne's crackdown on VAT avoidance</a>.</p> <p>A quick search on the internet shows HMV.com, which has closed its Guernsey warehouse and returned its mail order operations to the UK, is regularly more expensive than other traders.</p> <p>Until this VAT avoidance is dealt with more firmly HMV's 240 high-street stores will stand little hope of a meaningful life after administration.</p> <p>The chancellor promised to act against other jurisdictions if the VAT-free sites relocated away from the Channel Islands. They are now calling his bluff. Will he respond?</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Steep rises in energy bills kept inflation high in December, putting more pressure on household budgets and fuelling fears that consumers will be unable to drive an economic recovery in the UK. The Office for National Statistics said that the annual increase in the cost of living, as measured by the consumer prices index, stuck at 2.7% for the third month running in December. Five of the big six energy companies introduced price rises in December, hitting some 25m households. That was partially offset by a decline in petrol prices, which fell by 2.8p a litre between November and December. Policymakers are particularly concerned about inflation, as prices are rising much faster than wages, hammering consumers' spending power. Consumers account for around two-thirds of all spending in Britain, which is still fighting to avoid falling into a triple-dip recession. Rob Wood at Berenberg Bank said: \"Above-target inflation means households' hard-earned pounds are not stretching as far as they used to. With export conditions tough and households unlikely to drive growth in the near-term, the theme for the next six months is likely to be one of the economy bouncing along the bottom.\" Stubbornly high inflation, which has been running above the Bank of England's 2% target since November 2009, is likely to have been a key argument against expanding the quantitative easing programme at the bank's monthly policy meeting last week, as pumping more money into the system drives prices higher. In November, the bank said inflation would peak in the third quarter of 2013 and would only fall below the 2% target in the third quarter of 2014. The ONS said the cost of housing and household services rose by 2% between November and December, driven by escalating gas and electricity bills. Air fares helped offset the increase, with prices rising at a far slower rate than a year ago. Food inflation remained high at 3.8%, prompting some economists to say that could accelerate in the coming months. The figures appear to put an end to the spat between retailers over whether there was more discounting on the high street ahead of Christmas this year. The ONS said the price of clothing declined by 1.5% between November and December, compared with a fall of 2.8% in 2011. Economists said inflation could move above 3% this year, which would trigger a letter from the Bank of England to the Treasury explaining why it had missed its 2% target by a percentage point. Peter Dixon at Commerzbank said: \"It's entirely possible that by mid-year we'll get a very sharp spike in inflation back above 3%. While the inflation numbers do seem to slip down the Bank of England's agenda \u2013 which is clearly focused on growth \u2013 there's no doubt that the inflation target itself continues to come in for a battering given what's been happening to prices not just in December but over a period of years.\"",

Conclusions will be reached in the enforcement investigation in due course and any further appropriate action determined at that time\". The US regulator, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, said it had conducted \"several targeted exams\" and listed \"deficiencies\" in the so-called chief investment office, including \"inadequate oversight and governance to protect the bank from material risk, inadequate risk management processes and procedures, inadequate control over trade valuation, inadequate development and implementation of models used by the bank\". The OCC issued a so-called cease and desist order as it also cited inadequate internal audit processes. The US Federal Reserve gave 60 days to submit a plan to enhance its risk management. The way top executives are paid also needs to be reviewed to take account of \"adverse risk outcomes and control deficiencies\". The Fed also issued another order against JP Morgan requiring it to take corrective action to enhance its programme for compliance with the bank secrecy act and other anti-money laundering requirements at various subsidiaries. The CIO where the problems are understood to have occurred involved the arcane $10 trillion credit default swaps markets, a type of insurance against companies defaulting, one an index of 125 companies including Campbell's Soup, Time Warner and Walt Disney. Thomas Curry, of the OCC, said in June that the so-called CIO had \"inadequate risk management\" while the bank's high-profile chief executive, Jamie Dimon, had been left embarrassed by the losses that occurred only months after he dismissed reports about the trading activities. Dimon \u2013 who until the \"London Whale\" debacle had been regarded as having escaped the financial crisis with his reputation relatively unscathed \u2013 is now expected to be stripped of part of his bonus following the publication of the bank's results later this week. JP Morgan neither admitted or denied the findings but said it had \"already made progress\" in dealing with the matters raised. The bank said there were no allegations of \"intentional misconduct by the firm or any of its employees\".",

      "bodyText": "For HMV, Britain's last major high street DVD and CD chain, the music is about to stop. Nipper, the mascot dog who has looked quizzically down the gramophone trumpet in store windows for more than 90 years, will no longer hear His Master's Voice. The company that opened its first shop on Oxford Street in 1921 is expected to call in administrators from Deloitte today as the 250-strong chain becomes the latest casualty in the battle between online and traditional shops, bringing uncertainty for a workforce of more than 4,500 at 240 HMV stores and nine Fopp outlets. The failure of the only surviving national music store follows the disappearance from the high street of other similar retailers such as Our Price, Virgin Megastores and Tower Records, along with other established high street names in recent times \u2013 Woolworths, Comet, JJB Sports and most recently Jessops. These once-cherished brands \u2013 many of which have disappeared from the high street \u2013 have all faced fierce competition in recent times from online competitors. Fashion sites such as Asos and DVD specialists such as Play.com are among the firms asking questions of traditional models of retailing \u2013 but it is the mighty Amazon that has cast the biggest shadow. Andrew Sentance, the music fan and economist, last night suggested there could be more high street failures as internet firms continue to take business from traditional shops. \"Comet &amp; Jessops: now HMV. Is there more trouble in store?\" the former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee, tweeted. \"Since 2007, the [internet's] share retail sales (excluding motor fuel) has risen from less than 4% to over 10% \u2013 with internet spending growing at around 25% per annum in value terms.\" On Monday evening one supplier to HMV said the firm's failure was \"regrettable but inevitable\". He said: \"They missed the internet boat. Amazon are eating up their physical sales [hard copy CDs and DVDs] and iTunes are eating up their digital sales.\" He said film studios and music labels had done everything they could to keep HMV alive, agreeing a year ago to take some of the company's solvency risk to allow it to keep trading. In particular, they have been desperate to keep competitors to Amazon going. \"All of my negotiations involved playing people off against one another. As a supplier, those options are fast disappearing now.\" It remains to seen what the impact will be on the film companies and record labels that rely on its stores for their sales. Despite its troubled position, the retailer still sells 27% of all DVDs and Blu-Ray and 38% of the physical music market. Veteran retailers and City analysts are now looking at which section of the high street might be next to fall prey to internet competition. The bookselling industry has long been seen as vulnerable. In the run up to Christmas, James Daunt, the chief executive of Waterstones \u2013 which had only been sold by HMV months earlier \u2013 delivered a vicious attack on Amazon, describing it as \"a ruthless, money-making devil\" and \"the consumer's enemy\". More recently retailers have publicly attacked the dominance of the US web rival, taking issue in particular with what is seen as the unfair tax advantages its has. John Lewis chief executive Andy Street said that online multinationals such as Amazon were \"destroying the UK tax base\". Mothercare chairman, Alan Parker, said he supported the view of the John Lewis boss: \"Our objective is to beat our competition to provide the best possible value to our customers. Unfair pricing from international UK tax dodgers puts our long-term ability to survive and grow under threat.\" Some City analysts have suggested weaker high street chains in sectors ranging from gambling to holidays are also losing ground to online rivals. Greg Johnson, of Shore Capital, recently noted debt-laden Thomas Cook has \"suffered from low online sales but in addition a bloated high-cost structurally declining UK high street retail estate\". Meanwhile declines in high street betting on horse racing have been masked by the lucrative impact of new slot machines, but some industry veterans fear even the high street bookmakers may soon start to feel the pain as online competition marches on. HMV's failure comes after years of fierce competition from supermarkets that sell CDs and other music lines. It has been struggling with debts for over two years and while banks have revised the terms of their loans it was thought to been handed a lifeline after its suppliers, including Universal Music, EMI, Warner Brothers and Disney, were handed shares in exchange for improved commercial terms. But they were said on Monday to have refused to agree to provide additional financing, leaving the retailer with few options to find the extra resources needed to keep trading. HMV's website was still advertising its 25% off sale on Monday. The chain had been attempting to shift out of films and music and into accessories such as headphones. But it has not been enough to counter the decline in conventional sales, which even two years ago forced the then chief executive Simon Fox to warn that the bank was being smothered by its mountain of debt. He jumped ship to Trinity Mirror last year to be replaced by Trevor Moore, the former boss of Jessops which itself collapsed last week. The photographic retailer closed its 187 shops for the last time on Friday and made 1,370 staff redundant. It is one of several high street names to go to the wall over the past year, including the electrical retailer Comet, clothing chain Peacocks and JJB sports. HMV is arguably the highest-profile name to collapse during the prolonged economic down turn and changing shopping habits that also forced Woolworths out of business five years ago at the start of the banking crisis. Ironically the collapse of Woolworths had initially helped HMV which enjoyed a peak in sales shortly afterwards before the competition escalated from supermarkets and online retailers. A weak economy in the runup to Christmas has exacerbated the woes of retailers struggling with business models that have been overwhelmed by technological changes such as the explosion in camera phones, which destabilised Jessops, and the explosion in internet downloading which undermined demand for CDs and DVDs at HMV. With consumers less keen to spend over the key festive period, which is a make-or-break time for struggling retailers, Jessops and HMV have been unable to provide to their financiers that they have a viable business model. Last month, in the midst of the Christmas trading period, HMV had warned that the tough trading conditions meant it was already struggling despite having installed a new management team in Moore and a new finance director, Ian Kenyon. Customers' views 'It's a shame, but not unexpected' Clutching a DVD of the comedy series The Comeback, as well as his receipt, Robin Smith was oblivious to the breaking news of HMV's demise as he left the chain's late-opening Piccadilly Circus branch on Monday evening. \"I'm not really sentimental about it to be honest, but I suppose it's a shame, though not really unexpected, is it?\" Smith said with a shrug after being told the 90-year-old retailer had become the latest high street casualty after announcing it had been forced to call in administrators. Inside the store, located on the other side of Piccadilly Circus from the one-time site of a flagship branch of one of the other recent casualties of the dominance of online shopping, Tower Records, the atmosphere was no more funereal than usual. Standing beside blue and white balloons put up for a \"Blue Cross Ssale offering 25% discounts on many products, a manager said she \"could neither confirm nor deny\" anything in relation to the closure of the company, which employs 4,500 people. However, music blogger Chris Heasman was left disappointed despite making a dash across London on the tube in a bid to spend two HMV giftcards after learning two hours earlier on Twitter that HMV was to close and that the cards could be worthless. \"They just said come back tomorrow', although they didn't seem to be holding out much hope,\" said Heasman, 19. \"Normally I try to support independent record stores and I'm not really sure if the closure of HMV will make that much of a difference to them. But it does have a historic significance in the sense that it has been going since the 60s and well before. You can't be too sympathetic about the guys at the top but 4,500 people losing their jobs matter.\" After him came Jeri Jelensky and Zoe Fereday, who had differing opinions about the fate of HMV and other high street outlets. \"They have staved off closure for a while but it did seem like they were flogging a dead horse and towards the end it did seem like the prices were really not attractive,\" said Jelensky, who said he preferred to buy online. Fereday said: \"I'm the opposite. I'm more likely to pop into a shop like HMV because you would always just come across something a bit different.\" Ben Quinn",

      "body": "<p>The Bank of England is to be given sweeping new powers to prevent house prices spiralling out of control, amid predictions that a year of stable house prices in 2013 will spark a resurgence in homebuying.</p> <p>The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) predicts the number of house sales will jump amid a resurgence in confidence that prices will stabilise and believes they may even start to move up towards the end of the year.

In addition to this so-called sectoral capital requirement, the FPC will be able to force banks to build up capital during boom years, through what are known as countercyclical buffers.</p> <p>The Bank of England published for the first time on Monday 17 broad measures that would be used to decide whether to order banks to amass capital. The Bank tried to demonstrate that the new measures \u2013 described in the past as a return to a 1970s quasi-nationalisation of the banking industry \u2013 would not impede economic growth in the future.</p> <p>\"If these tools are successful in reducing the likelihood and severity of financial crises, their use is likely to boost the expected level of UK GDP,\" the Bank of England said.</p> <p>Amid fears that the UK is heading towards a triple-dip recession, there appears to be little expectation that the FPC would be attempting to use its new powers during its quarterly meeting in June, when it will first be granted the ability to intervene directly.</p> <p>Fourth-quarter GDP figures scheduled for publication next week may show the economy contracted but the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said on Tuesday that the latest data on the UK economy suggested \"a moderate firming in growth over the coming months\". The government's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), is predicting growth of 1.2% in the UK economy this year compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2012.</p> <p>Marking an improving trend over recent months, the OECD said its leading indicator rose to 100.7 in November from 100.5 in October. The indicator hit a low of 99.2 in early 2012 after reaching a high of 101.5 soon after the coalition government took office.</p> <p>However, the OECD warned that the improving situation should be set against a forecast that the economy shrank in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the strong possibility that the UK will suffer a full-blown triple-dip recession.</p> <p>While the housing market is moribund, Rics said that more homebuyers would emerge in 2013 than last year due to the stabilising UK economy and a lack of sovereign bankruptcies in the eurozone.</p> <p>Last month, 24% more surveyors across the country predicted transactions to rise rather than fall over the next quarter, said Rics.</p> <p>The number of homes coming up for sale remained relatively stable last month, while demand from would-be buyers saw a continued increase, according to the Rics survey. A north-south divide will persist in 2013 as London once again bucked the overall trend and saw significant price rises last month.</p> <p>The north-east and Wales saw the biggest drops. Notably, prices levelled out in the West Midlands last month. This represents the first time in more than two and a half years that prices have stopped falling.</p> <p>Peter Bolton King, Rics' global residential director, said: \"As we start the new year, confidence in the housing market does appear to be improving \u2026 it may be that we are now over the very worst.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said the lacklustre growth expected in the next couple of years would drive up the UK's debts and force rating agencies to strip the country of its coveted AAA credit status.</p> <p>Among its forecasts for 2018 are that the debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to 85% compared with the government target of 79% and the deficit in that year will be \u00a368bn \u2013 more than double the \u00a331bn forecast by the OBR.</p> <p>Scott Corfe, one of the CEBR's economists, said: \"Weak economic growth will hold back the deficit-reduction programme over the coming years. In addition, there seems to have been a setback in reducing public spending \u2013 despite alleged austerity, we expect government consumption to have grown by 2.8% in real terms in 2012 \u2013 the fastest pace of growth since 2004. The combination of these two things means that the deficit-reduction programme will stretch into not just the next parliament but into the one after that.\"</p> <p>Douglas McWilliams, chief economist at CEBR and a contributor to the report, said: \"It will be almost impossible for the UK to maintain its AAA rating in the light of this forecast. The debt/GDP ratio is only forecast to stabilise in 2017-18 and start edging down thereafter.\"</p>",

Amid fears that the UK is heading towards a triple-dip recession, there appears to be little expectation that the FPC would be attempting to use its new powers during its quarterly meeting in June, when it will first be granted the ability to intervene directly. Fourth-quarter GDP figures scheduled for publication next week may show the economy contracted but the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said on Tuesday that the latest data on the UK economy suggested \"a moderate firming in growth over the coming months\". The government's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), is predicting growth of 1.2% in the UK economy this year compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2012. Marking an improving trend over recent months, the OECD said its leading indicator rose to 100.7 in November from 100.5 in October. The indicator hit a low of 99.2 in early 2012 after reaching a high of 101.5 soon after the coalition government took office. However, the OECD warned that the improving situation should be set against a forecast that the economy shrank in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the strong possibility that the UK will suffer a full-blown triple-dip recession. While the housing market is moribund, Rics said that more homebuyers would emerge in 2013 than last year due to the stabilising UK economy and a lack of sovereign bankruptcies in the eurozone. Last month, 24% more surveyors across the country predicted transactions to rise rather than fall over the next quarter, said Rics. The number of homes coming up for sale remained relatively stable last month, while demand from would-be buyers saw a continued increase, according to the Rics survey. A north-south divide will persist in 2013 as London once again bucked the overall trend and saw significant price rises last month. The north-east and Wales saw the biggest drops. Notably, prices levelled out in the West Midlands last month. This represents the first time in more than two and a half years that prices have stopped falling. Peter Bolton King, Rics' global residential director, said: \"As we start the new year, confidence in the housing market does appear to be improving \u2026 it may be that we are now over the very worst.\" Meanwhile, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said the lacklustre growth expected in the next couple of years would drive up the UK's debts and force rating agencies to strip the country of its coveted AAA credit status. Among its forecasts for 2018 are that the debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to 85% compared with the government target of 79% and the deficit in that year will be \u00a368bn \u2013 more than double the \u00a331bn forecast by the OBR. Scott Corfe, one of the CEBR's economists, said: \"Weak economic growth will hold back the deficit-reduction programme over the coming years. In addition, there seems to have been a setback in reducing public spending \u2013 despite alleged austerity, we expect government consumption to have grown by 2.8% in real terms in 2012 \u2013 the fastest pace of growth since 2004. The combination of these two things means that the deficit-reduction programme will stretch into not just the next parliament but into the one after that.\" Douglas McWilliams, chief economist at CEBR and a contributor to the report, said: \"It will be almost impossible for the UK to maintain its AAA rating in the light of this forecast. The debt/GDP ratio is only forecast to stabilise in 2017-18 and start edging down thereafter.\"",
