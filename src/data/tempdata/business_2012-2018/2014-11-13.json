      "bodyText": "PS: a mini closing market report, courtesy of Chris Beauchamp, Market Analyst, IG: Oil firms and associated companies are once again populating the bottom of the FTSE 100\u2019s scoreboard as Brent drops below $80 for the first time in over four years. A hefty day of UK earnings means that the broader index is still posting good gains, helped along by the likes of ITV and the LSE, rising after decent figures this morning. Hopes of Chinese stimulus following underwhelming data this morning look a bit far-fetched, but with a paucity of real data it looks like the market is pleased to believe in the idea for the time being. US indices continue to provide strength from which the UK and Europe can draw to gain further ground, although the DAX\u2019s drop below 9300 will have a few traders fretting that divergences between the economies of the eurozone and the US will continue to make themselves felt. Even so, a few calming words from Mario Draghi could easily allow Europe to make up the gap, as we continue to await an early Christmas present from the ECB. And here\u2019s the situation across Europe: Early finish today, as tomorrow\u2019s going to be busy -- growth figures for much of the eurozone are released in the morning. We\u2019re about to find out if Germany is in recession, and if the wider European economy stagnated..... See you in the morning....GW That increase in Americans resigning their jobs may herald a pick-up in earnings... America\u2019s employment market continues to improve, according to the latest US labour force data. The number of job hires jumped to a six-year high of five million in September, with the job hire rate hitting 3.6%, up from 3.3% in August. And the percentage of people quitting their jobs hit a six-year high of 2.0%, up from 1.8% in August. ECB governing council member Sabine Lautenschlaeger didn\u2019t really cause a stir in Stockholm today, despite speculation that she might criticise calls for more stimulus measures. Instead, the German central banker announced that the ECB has received capital-raising plans from the banks which failed its stress tests last month. We have received these plans ...on Nov 10, and are now in the process of thoroughly checking them with the aim to provide banks with an assessment before the end of the year\u201d, Interested in inequality? Check out this piece by my colleague Angela Monaghan on how American wealth has become increasingly concentrated in the hands of, well, a handful of ultra-rich: Wealth inequality in the US is at near record levels according to a new study by academics. Over the past three decades, the share of household wealth owned by the top 0.1% has increased from 7% to 22%. For the bottom 90% of families, a combination of rising debt, the collapse of the value of their assets during the financial crisis, and stagnant real wages have led to the erosion of wealth. Full piece: US wealth inequality - top 0.1% worth as much as the bottom 90% Financial experts have been digesting the huge fines handed down yesterday to banks who didn\u2019t prevent their traders manipulating the foreign exchange market. And two camps are emerging. One, led by veteran City analyst David Buik, are aghast that Forex traders were illicitly sharing information to make profits, often at their own clients expense. Buik, who has been working in the markets for 52 years, says Thursday was the saddest day of his career. He writes: Any thought of a quick return of respect and trust towards the financial sector has been blown out of the water by a small collection of mindless, greedy, selfish and arrogant congenital idiots. He\u2019s now reached the conclusion that fining banks simply doesn\u2019t work -- as my colleague Nils Pratley also argued last night. The forex scandal proves fines don\u2019t deter bad banks. So ban them from trading However, former stock broker Dan Davies has written a fascinating piece explaining the underlying story in the FX market, using the example of buying and selling oranges. ON MONDAY: You are on your way to the fruit market, because you want to buy five oranges. Someone you\u2019ve never met before accosts you on your way and says \u201cHey, you! Could you buy me five oranges please? I\u2019ll give you the money when you come back and pay you ten pence for doing it\u201d. You think what the hell, and say yes. Down at the market, there is one stall which has five oranges for sale at 50p each, and another stall with five oranges for sale but charging 55p each. You buy ten oranges and head back home. Your customer is waiting back at your gate. He gives you your ten pence, and asks \u201cHow much did my oranges cost?\u201d What do you tell him? By Friday, you\u2019re in quite a pickle....Oranges, lemons and forex And Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine has a fine explanation of why FX traders were sharing information and the limited power it gave them, (not that it makes it right!): These guys really were cheating. By knowing in advance what their buddies were doing, by concentrating orders in one set of hands, by feeling out the non-chat-room banks, the traders in their chat rooms did get an unfair advantage that allowed them to feel comfortable trading in inefficient ways that did push the price around more than pure supply and demand would dictate. But this isn\u2019t Libor manipulation, where they just made stuff up. This is tinkering at the edges of real supply and demand. And it helps to explain why their profits seem to have been relatively modest and inconsistent. There was only so much they could do. And sometimes they just got it wrong. Banks Manipulated Foreign Exchange in Ways You Can\u2019t Teach. Just in -- the number of Americans signing on for jobless benefit jumped by 12,000 last week, to 290,000. Economists had only expected a 2,000 rise. The oil price is hitting new four-year lows, with Brent crude now down to $78.71 per barrel. That\u2019s a drop of over $1.50, or 2%, today, amid talk of the oil market being flooded with supplies. Oil company share prices are being hit -- Royal Dutch Shell are down 2% in London, and Tullow Oil has shed 3.6%. Quick tweak: Berkshire Hathaway are paying $4.7bn in P&amp;G\u2019s own shares for Duracell, which will be recapitalised with $1.7bn of cash from P&amp;G before being sold to Warren Buffett. So there\u2019s $6.4bn sloshing around here, but I think effectively P&amp;G will be $3bn better off in return for selling their battery business. The Duracell Bunny is moving to a new warren, literally. Berkshire Hathaway, the group run by veteran investor Warren Buffett, has just announced it is acquiring the Duracell Battery Business from Procter &amp; Gamble. 84-year old Buffett, who like the Duracell bunny is known for his stamina, says: \u201cI have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&amp;G and Gillette \u201cDuracell is a leading global brand with top quality products, and it will fit well within Berkshire Hathaway.\u201d More here. Jaguar Land Rover workers have turned down a pay offer worth an extra 15% over the next three years, ITV\u2019s Joel Hills reports. The offer is worth 7.7% in the first 12 months \u2013 an \u2018inflation-busting\u2019 increase in anyone\u2019s book. The staff at JLR reckon they deserve a better deal, though, given the company\u2019s success. Last week, business secretary Vince Cable warned that the West Midlands economy could suffer badly if JLR workers were to strike. The Brent crude oil price will keep falling, reckons Capital Economics\u2019 experts.... This morning\u2019s eurozone inflation data, and the latest fall in the oil price, add to the gloom in the eurozone, reckons Edward Knox, currency analyst at Caxton FX. With the oil price continuing to drift with very little support, and increasing geo-political risks today\u2019s announcement will have done no favours for Mario Draghi and his team. Monetary easing is a tool that they still have in their locker, and the pressure to use this will have increased this morning. Mounting expectations of further stimulus down the line will most likely have a negative impact on the single currency going forward. The US dollar, backed by the resurgent US economy is the currency most primed to take advantage of the weaker outlook in the euro zone. Reminder: German annual inflation remained at 0.8% in October and French CPI rose to 0.5%, but Italian prices are up just 0.1% in the last year, while in Spain they are down by 0.1%. Greece\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen, but that\u2019s partly because more adults dropped out of the labour force this summer. The Greek jobless rate dipped to 25.9% in August, down from 26.1% in July. That\u2019s an improvement on the 27.8% recorded a year ago. (these rates are all seasonally adjusted.) ELSTAT reports that the number of unemployed Greeks fell by 20,398 in August compared to July. But the number in employment also fell month-on-month, by 15,698. The number of people classed as \u2018inactive\u2019 (neither in work nor looking for work) jumped by 31,709 during the month. More here. The oil price has hit a new four-year low today, in another sign of economic weakness. Brent crude has fallen another to $79.38 in the last few minutes, as weak Chinese data added to warnings that the world could see a \u2018glut\u2019 of oil. Brent fell below $80 per barrel for the first time since September 2010 last night, after the US Energy Information Administration lowered its output forecast and predicted that Saudi Arabia would cut supply. The news today that China\u2019s industrial production expanded at a slower rate in October also hit the oil price, as Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains: Oil remains under the cosh after China Industrial production data confirmed the nation\u2019s slowdown moving into the fourth quarter of the year, intensifying questions over global demand while production is rising. The OPEC group is due to meet later this month, but oil analysts aren\u2019t convinced that producers will agree action to underpin the oil price. Last night, Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi tried to calm talk of a price war raging in the energy market, saying: Talk of a price war is a sign of misunderstanding, deliberate or otherwise, and has no basis in reality... \u201cWe want stable oil markets and steady prices, because this is good for producers, consumers and investors.\u201d As this chart shows, the oil price has been sliding since the summer. Good news for consumers, but bad for oil producers in the Middle East and for Russia. It also pushes down inflation, which households will welcome, but central bankers in the euro area will not.... A group of Europe\u2019s top economists and forecasters have slashed their growth and inflation forecasts for the eurozone, highlighting the region\u2019s economic problems. They have warned the European Central Bank that they expect euro inflation to be just 0.5% this year, down from 0.7%; and 1.0% in 2015, down from 1.2% previously. They also expect weaker inflation in 2016 too -- just 1.4%, down from 1.5%. In other words, well short of the ECB\u2019s target of just below 2% even in two years time, even with the stimulus measures already agreed. The panel of 61 economists and academics also cut their forecast for GDP growth this year to 0.8%, from 1.0%. They also expect little improvement in 2015, with predicted growth cut to 1.2% from 1.5%. Or in 2016, where projected growth is lowered to 1.5% from 1.7%. They warn that geopolitical threats from Ukraine and the Middle East, and the threat of lower from China and the US, could all potentially hit growth. This is what Bank of England governor Mark Carney was talking about yesterday, when he warned that the spectre of economic stagnation was looming over Europe. These forecasts are included in the ECB\u2019s Monthly Bulletin, which was just released (it\u2019s online here). That Bulletin warns that: Since the summer months, incoming data and survey evidence have overall indicated a weakening in the euro area\u2019s growth momentum. adding that the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. In particular, the weakening in the euro area\u2019s growth momentum, alongside heightened geopolitical risks, could dampen confidence and, in particular, private investment. In addition, insufficient progress in structural reforms in euro area countries constitutes a key downward risk to the economic outlook. The panel of independent experts warned that there is a risk that a \u201csustained period of low growth and low inflation\u201d would put firms off from investing and employing staff..... It\u2019s a stark warning, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s growth figures (from 6.30am GMT sharp!) October\u2019s Italian inflation data is just out, and it shows that prices inched up by just 0.1% over the last year, and also on a month-on-month basis. Back in the UK, Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent has warned that real wages and productivity need to rise for Britain to enjoy a proper recovery. Speaking to the BBC, Broadbent said it was \u201cextremely welcome\u201d that real wages are finally rising. but: \u201cWhat is true is that it\u2019s hard to have a sustained recovery in which ... productivity and real rates of pay don\u2019t start to rise,\u201d. Yesterday\u2019s unemployment report showed that earnings grew faster than inflation in September, after years of squeezed living standards. Here comes the Spanish inflation data.... and it shows that prices are still lower this year than in 2013. The Spanish consumer prices index fell by 0.1% annually in October, matching September\u2019s decline. On a EU-harmonised basis, CPI fell by 0.2%. On a monthly basis, prices picked up by 0.5% between September and October. But as with France and Germany, the long-term trend is clear. The long-term trend of German and French inflation shows a clear direction.... France\u2019s statistics body, INSEE, says that rising costs of food and services helped to push the French inflation rate up to 0.5% last month. However, the prices of manufactured products declined in October and those of energy, especially those of petroleum products, went on falling. And annual core inflation, stripping out volatile items like food and fuel, was flat for the second month running, as this chart shows: Here comes the French inflation report...and it\u2019s slightly more encouraging than expected. However, the data also shows that Europe\u2019s second-largest economy remains worryingly close to deflation. France\u2019s consumer prices index (harmonised) rose by 0.5% annually in October, up from 0.3% in September. That beats forecasts of 0.4%. Prices were unchanged month-on-month. A long way from the ECB\u2019s target of inflation close to, but below, 2%. Still, Credit Agricole\u2019s Frederik Ducrozet is encouraged by the move: German inflation rate remains weak, with prices in Europe\u2019s largest economy rising by just 0.8% over the last year. Data released by federal statistics office Destatis showed that the German consumer prices index rose by 0.8% in October, or just 0.7% on an EU-harmonised basis. Prices actually fell by 0.3% in October compared with September. That confirms the flash estimates from earlier this month, and underlines that Germany\u2019s economy is experiencing weak demand. But has it fallen into recession? We find out in 24 hours time, when the GDP data is released. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, eurozone and business. Coming up today... new inflation figures from the Eurozone\u2019s Big Four economies are all released this morning. The latest consumer prices index figures from Germany, France, Italy and Spain will show whether the eurozone remains close to deflation, and requires additional stimulus measures. The overall inflation figure for the whole eurozone is released tomorrow, along with growth data for the third quarter of this year. We might get a new insight into the state of play at the European Central Bank at 1pm when Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger, a member of the ECB\u2019s governing council, gives a speech. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it: Given all the chatter about splits in the governing council it might well be listening to the other German on the ECB council, Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger later this morning when she gives a speech in Stockholm, and who like Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann is not a fan of QE. We\u2019ll also be digesting new data from China earlier this morning. Growth in Industrial production and retail sales both dipped last month, adding to concerns that its economy is slowing. And this afternoon, we get the latest weekly US jobs figures. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

By knowing in advance what their buddies were doing, by concentrating orders in one set of hands, by feeling out the non-chat-room banks, the traders in their chat rooms <em>did </em>get an unfair advantage that allowed them to feel comfortable trading in inefficient ways that <em>did </em>push the price around more than pure supply and demand would dictate. </p> <p>But this isn\u2019t Libor manipulation, where they just made stuff up. </p> <p>This is tinkering at the edges of real supply and demand.

      "bodyText": "Asda is ready to increase its \u00a31bn price-cuts campaign after revealing its biggest sales decline for eight years and saying that supermarkets had been hit by a \u201cshockwave\u201d in the last three months. Andy Clarke, chief executive of the UK\u2019s second largest supermarket group, said he had already spent more than intended of a \u00a31bn price-cuts budget in the first year of a five-year plan and that there was \u201cevery possibility\u201d he would now sanction additional price reductions as the supermarket price war intensifies. All the major grocers have now taken a scythe to prices or sent out millions of money-off vouchers in an attempt to fend off discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Sainsbury\u2019s said on Wednesday that it would be spending \u00a3150m on price cuts over the next year. In May, Morrisons said it would spend \u00a31bn on cutting prices and improving products over three years. Tesco has already spent more than \u00a3200m on price cuts and is widely expected to ratchet up the pressure next year under new chief executive Dave Lewis. Clarke mocked Sainsbury\u2019s \u00a3150m of cuts: \u201cFor us it feels like a drop in the ocean \u2026 our price gap with Sainsbury\u2019s already is in double digits. I\u2019m surprised at the low level of price investment if that\u2019s [meant] to be a competitive force against us.\u201d Asda blamed a tough market and the blizzard of discount vouchers for the group\u2019s first fall in sales since the last quarter of 2013. Sales at established stores, excluding petrol, have fallen by 1.6% in the three months to 30 September. \u201cThe last quarter has seen a shockwave go through our industry and others are starting to respond to the challenges they face. I expect that we will see another tough quarter and I\u2019m under no illusions that the battle continues to rage,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cA new reality is upon us and although we were the first to adapt, we need to do everything to remain ahead of our traditional competitors while removing reasons for customers to go to the small discount shops.\u201d Despite the admission that Asda may have to spend more on lowering prices, Clarke insisted the supermarket chain was performing well. \u201cThere are very clear winners and losers within our market ... we are a clear winner, along with the discounters and premium players like Waitrose,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are pulling away from the other three traditional retailers in this market and price is playing a part in that.\u201d The retailer said it had increased market share to 17.3%, up from 17.2% a year ago, after implementing a swath of price cuts a year ago and putting a \u201cprice lock\u201d on more than 150 products. Clarke and his team attributed Asda\u2019s relatively strong performance to the offer of consistently low prices rather than using discount \u201cgimmicks\u201d. He also pointed to strong sales of George clothing and homewares and a 19.6% rise in sales of groceries via the internet. He said Asda would not be swayed from its strategy of cutting prices on regularly stocked items on the basis of one quarter of poor sales and insisted his rivals\u2019 heavy use of discount vouchers was \u201cdesperate\u201d and unsustainable. Barry Williams, Asda\u2019s chief merchandising officer, described Morrisons\u2019 voucher scheme as \u201cquantitative easing\u201d for shoppers. He was also highly critical of Morrisons\u2019 new loyalty card, which claims to match discounters Aldi and Lidl on price. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in overcharging customers and then rewarding them with points on plastic,\u201d he said. Williams also suggested rivals were deceiving customers by cutting prices only to increase them later. But Clarke admitted the coming few months were likely to continue to be tough for Asda, which is part of the Walmart empire, and that profitability was falling in line with sales as the retailer cut prices. Sales at Asda\u2019s superstores continue to decline, offsetting growth at its small supermarkets and online. The retailer is to begin to trial new ways of organising its largest stores this week as it tries to tempt shoppers back from the discounters,",

      "body": "<p>Asda is ready to increase its \u00a31bn price-cuts campaign after revealing its biggest sales decline for eight years and saying that supermarkets had been hit by a \u201cshockwave\u201d in the last three months.</p> <p>Andy Clarke, chief executive of the UK\u2019s second largest supermarket group, said he had already spent more than intended of a \u00a31bn price-cuts budget in the first year of a five-year plan and that there was \u201cevery possibility\u201d he would now sanction additional price reductions as the supermarket price war intensifies.</p> <p>All the major grocers have now taken a scythe to prices or sent out millions of money-off vouchers in an attempt to fend off discounters such as Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s said on Wednesday that it would be spending \u00a3150m on price cuts over the next year. In May, Morrisons said it would spend \u00a31bn on cutting prices and improving products over three years. Tesco has already spent more than \u00a3200m on price cuts and is widely expected to ratchet up the pressure next year under new chief executive Dave Lewis.</p> <p>Clarke mocked Sainsbury\u2019s \u00a3150m of cuts: \u201cFor us it feels like a drop in the ocean \u2026 our price gap with Sainsbury\u2019s already is in double digits. I\u2019m surprised at the low level of price investment if that\u2019s [meant] to be a competitive force against us.\u201d</p> <p>Asda blamed a tough market and the blizzard of discount vouchers for the group\u2019s first fall in sales since the last quarter of 2013. Sales at established stores, excluding petrol, have fallen by 1.6% in the three months to 30 September.</p> <p>\u201cThe last quarter has seen a shockwave go through our industry and others are starting to respond to the challenges they face. I expect that we will see another tough quarter and I\u2019m under no illusions that the battle continues to rage,\u201d Clarke said.</p> <p>\u201cA new reality is upon us and although we were the first to adapt, we need to do everything to remain ahead of our traditional competitors while removing reasons for customers to go to the small discount shops.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the admission that Asda may have to spend more on lowering prices, Clarke insisted the supermarket chain was performing well. \u201cThere are very clear winners and losers within our market ... we are a clear winner, along with the discounters and premium players like Waitrose,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are pulling away from the other three traditional retailers in this market and price is playing a part in that.\u201d</p> <p>The retailer said it had increased market share to 17.3%, up from 17.2% a year ago, after implementing a swath of price cuts a year ago and putting a \u201cprice lock\u201d on more than 150 products.</p> <p>Clarke and his team attributed Asda\u2019s relatively strong performance to the offer of consistently low prices rather than using discount \u201cgimmicks\u201d. He also pointed to strong sales of George clothing and homewares and a 19.6% rise in sales of groceries via the internet.</p> <p>He said Asda would not be swayed from its strategy of cutting prices on regularly stocked items on the basis of one quarter of poor sales and insisted his rivals\u2019 heavy use of discount vouchers was \u201cdesperate\u201d and unsustainable.</p> <p>Barry Williams, Asda\u2019s chief merchandising officer, described Morrisons\u2019 voucher scheme as \u201cquantitative easing\u201d for shoppers. He was also highly critical of Morrisons\u2019 new loyalty card, which claims to match discounters Aldi and Lidl on price. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in overcharging customers and then rewarding them with points on plastic,\u201d he said. Williams also suggested rivals were deceiving customers by cutting prices only to increase them later.</p> <p>But Clarke admitted the coming few months were likely to continue to be tough for Asda, which is part of the Walmart empire, and that profitability was falling in line with sales as the retailer cut prices. Sales at Asda\u2019s superstores continue to decline, offsetting growth at its small supermarkets and online. The retailer is to begin to trial new ways of organising its largest stores this week as it tries to tempt shoppers back from the discounters,</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eurostar has unveiled the first train in its upgraded fleet that will boost seat numbers by 20%. The cross-Channel train operator also announced an order of seven more high-speed trains from Siemens, and said the first of the 17 e320 trains, worth almost \u00a31bn, will go into service late next year. From the outside the train still looks like a \u201cparked shark\u201d \u2013 as the original was dubbed before going into service 20 years ago \u2013 but the e320\u2019s interior is brighter, lighter and much more spacious than its predecessor. It will carry 900 passengers and have a free wireless network throughout, with standard class coaches getting a major upgrade that includes power sockets at every seat and USB ports in business class. At a launch event at St Pancras station in London, Eurostar showed off its first complete e320 \u2013 so called because it is capable of speeds of up to 320kmh (200mph) \u2013 though the current restriction is 300kmh and the train slows to 160kmh in the Channel tunnel. The trains are slightly higher and wider than the original, with thinner seats and a reduced driver\u2019s cabin to boost passenger capacity. Italian designers Pininfarina, who work with Ferrari and Maserati, will also refurbish the entire existing fleet \u2013 including toilet and buffet bar revamps \u2013 as the new trains come into service. Andy Slater, rolling stock director at Eurostar, said the redesigned seats and tables would give passengers breathing room: \u201cOur numerous polls of passengers showed that what they really wanted was an increase in personal space.\u201d Eurostar chief executive Nicolas Petrovic said the redesign would \u201craise the bar, providing an unprecedented level of style and comfort for our customers\u201d. The train operator is set to launch new direct services, including to Amsterdam in 2016, and carried more than 10 million passengers for the first time last year.

It also highlights that the housing price boom of the past three years has been vastly different from that of the early 2000s, with home owners being much more cautious about using their increased wealth to either spend or go further into debt.</p> <p>Since the Reserve Bank began its cycle of cutting interest rates in November 2011, the housing market has become divided between Sydney and everywhere else. </p> <p>In that time, the average Sydney house price has risen by 31.9% \u2013 well above the next biggest rise, Darwin\u2019s 17.2%. So dominant is the Sydney housing market that no other capital city\u2019s housing prices have risen by more than the weighted average of all eight capitals:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/WQ62u/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The divide has, if anything, become more stark over the past year as Sydney\u2019s house prices have increased by 14.6%, compared with a 6.9% rise in the next fastest rising capital city, Melbourne. </p> <p>The reason for the increase in prices can be placed at the feet of investors. The latest <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/ProductsbyReleaseDate/05DBCE56402EC566CA25723D000F2999?OpenDocument\">housing finance</a> figures, also released this week, showed growth in lending since the RBA began cutting rates has been overwhelmingly led by investors. </p> <p>By December last year, investor housing finance had risen by 35%, compared with just 18% for owner occupier loans (excluding re-financing).</p> <p>The growth in approvals for both types of home loans has declined in the past nine months.

In some sense this is good, but in others it is less positive because the usual economic activity that comes from a rise in house prices has not occurred.</p> <p>In its recent <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2014/nov/html/index.html\">Statement on Monetary Policy</a>, the RBA found that low interest rates since 2011 have caused \u201ca strong rise in construction activity\u201d. This was the primary reason for lowering rates, as the RBA hoped construction could take up some of the slack from the slowing mining industry.

      "bodyText": "The latest housing price figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal that while the peak of the recent housing boom appears to have passed, Sydney\u2019s house price growth continues to outpace all other cities. It also highlights that the housing price boom of the past three years has been vastly different from that of the early 2000s, with home owners being much more cautious about using their increased wealth to either spend or go further into debt. Since the Reserve Bank began its cycle of cutting interest rates in November 2011, the housing market has become divided between Sydney and everywhere else. In that time, the average Sydney house price has risen by 31.9% \u2013 well above the next biggest rise, Darwin\u2019s 17.2%. So dominant is the Sydney housing market that no other capital city\u2019s housing prices have risen by more than the weighted average of all eight capitals: The divide has, if anything, become more stark over the past year as Sydney\u2019s house prices have increased by 14.6%, compared with a 6.9% rise in the next fastest rising capital city, Melbourne. The reason for the increase in prices can be placed at the feet of investors. The latest housing finance figures, also released this week, showed growth in lending since the RBA began cutting rates has been overwhelmingly led by investors. By December last year, investor housing finance had risen by 35%, compared with just 18% for owner occupier loans (excluding re-financing). The growth in approvals for both types of home loans has declined in the past nine months. But such has been the growth in investor financing that, excluding the refinancing of people\u2019s homes, investor home loans in September for the first time accounted for 50% of all housing loans: The good news for Sydneysiders and for others worried that housing prices are growing too fast is that the boom seems to have peaked: The housing boom this time round has been a very different beast from the one that occurred in the early 2000s. In some sense this is good, but in others it is less positive because the usual economic activity that comes from a rise in house prices has not occurred. In its recent Statement on Monetary Policy, the RBA found that low interest rates since 2011 have caused \u201ca strong rise in construction activity\u201d. This was the primary reason for lowering rates, as the RBA hoped construction could take up some of the slack from the slowing mining industry. It found that this has occurred to an extent as \u201cworkers with skills in construction are reported to be readily available, in part because demand for such labour from the resources sector has declined\u201d. However, house price rises also have an impact on the economy through the increased wealth they bring to home owners. It was this that drove the great explosion of consumption during the early 2000s. This impact was behind the view put forth by then prime minister John Howard, when he said in 2003, \u201cI don\u2019t get people stopping me in the street and saying, \u2018John you\u2019re outrageous, under your government the value of my house has increased\u2019.\u201d In his view, \u201cmost people feel more secure and feel better off because the value of their homes has gone up.\u201d But that is not happening this time round. The RBA noted that \u201cthe increase in wealth from rising housing prices is having less of an effect on consumption than it did previously. In particular, in recent years fewer households appear to have been utilising the increase in the value of their houses to increase their leverage or trade up\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Barclays could face a huge new penalty for rigging currency markets after pulling out at the 11th hour from the settlement talks that led to \u00a32.6bn of fines being slapped on six other big players in the currency markets. Barclays will not be eligible for the 30% discount on the fines handed to its rivals in exchange for settling early after its surprise move not to participate in the settlement with US and UK regulators. The bank, which was the first to be fined for rigging Libor in 2012, is reported not to have agreed to the settlement with the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority and the US commodity futures trading commission because of continuing talks with another US regulator. It was the only one of the banks involved in talks over the ground-breaking settlement that is also regulated by the New York State department of financial services (DFS), run by Benjamin Lawsky, the American attorney who has in the past taken a tough stance over wrongdoing at banks. Barclays said it had considered a settlement with the FCA and the CFTC on terms similar to the other banks \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, UBS, JP Morgan and Citigroup. \u201cHowever, after discussions with other regulators and authorities, we have concluded that it is in the interests of the company to seek a more general coordinated settlement,\u201d the bank said. Barclays shares fell more than 2% to 229.5p as investors worried about when the investigation could end, after the FCA said it would \u201cprogress our investigation into the firm\u201d and also look at its \u201cwider FX [foreign exchange] business areas\u201d. In Britain, UBS was handed the biggest fine, at \u00a3233m, followed by \u00a3225m for Citibank, JP Morgan at \u00a3222m, RBS at \u00a3217m and \u00a3216m for HSBC. In the US, the regulator fined Citibank and JP Morgan $310m (\u00a3196m) each, $290m (\u00a3184m) each for RBS and UBS, and $275m (\u00a3174m) for HSBC. The Swiss regulator \u2013 which also found issues with UBS\u2019s metal trading \u2013 also punished the Swiss bank for having failed to investigate warnings of currency market manipulation. Another US regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, also imposed fines on JP Morgan, Citi and Bank of America, taking the day\u2019s tally to \u00a32.6bn. The banks faced further fines from regulators whose investigations are continuing. The FCA and the CFTC published hundreds of pages of documents alongside their findings against five banks. Chatroom talk between traders showed them discussing information about their clients\u2019 orders with names such as \u201c3 musketeers\u201d and the \u201cA-team\u201d. The City minister, Andrea Leadsom, said those who had done wrong \u201cwill not be back in a dealing room on a big salary\u201d. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt\u2019s completely disgusting. I think taxpayers will be horrified \u2026 I don\u2019t know if corruption is a strong enough word for it.\u201d The FCA said 36 firms \u2013 including those involved in the announcement \u2013 would now be part of an \u201cindustry-wide remediation\u201d to root out failings in the market. Senior managers will be required to attest to changes to their practices and to conduct root-and-branch reviews of their businesses. \u201cA lot of it is not rocket science,\u201d said Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA, suggesting that, for instance, firms needed to look at whether employees were using mobile phones in dealing rooms. \u201cAll firms need to work with us to deliver real and lasting change to the culture of the trading floor. This is essential to restoring the public\u2019s trust in financial services and London maintaining its position as a strong and competitive financial centre,\u201d said Wheatley. The focus also turned to bonuses and whether firms would face legal action after agreeing to the fines for market manipulation that covered the period from 2008 to October last year \u2013 a period when banks such as RBS were being bailed out with billions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money. Clive Adamson, director of supervision at the FCA, said he expected firms to \u201cthink hard\u201d before deciding the size of bonuses. RBS said it would look at clawing back bonuses and what effect the settlement should have on bonuses for senior management. No current bonus payouts will take place until an internal investigation is completed and an update on that investigation was promised before the end of the year. \u201cToday is a stark reminder of the importance of culture and integrity in banking and we will rightly be judged on the strength of our response,\u201d said RBS\u2019s outgoing chairman, Sir Philip Hampton. RBS had received complaints from two clients, in October 2010 and January 2012, about the activities of forex traders and in November 2011 one of its own traders raised concerns, which were not heeded. \u201cWith hindsight, I don\u2019t think we followed them up terribly fully,\u201d said Hampton, who was chairman of the bank for most of the period. UBS has been ordered by its domestic regulator to limit its payouts to foreign exchange traders. Lawyers warned that the banks could face a flood of legal action after the fines. Anthony Maton at claimant litigation firm Hausfeld said: \u201cAny person or entity that engaged in FX transactions directly or indirectly with one or more of the colluding banks between 2008 and 2013 may have a civil claim.\u201d Simon Hart, banking litigation partner at lawyers RPC, said: \u201cThese fines and the evidence published today could trigger a flood of civil litigation from pension funds and other fund managers that lost money because of forex manipulation moving prices against them.\u201d The other regulators still investigating include the department of justice in the US and authorities in Asia. The US Federal Reserve announced it was also investigating possible improper conduct in foreign exchange markets. The FCA said Barclays was the only bank it was continuing to formally investigate, suggesting that others such as Deutsche Bank were not facing action by the UK regulator.",
