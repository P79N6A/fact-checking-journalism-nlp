      "bodyText": "Stansted airport, one of the prime contenders to supplant Heathrow as part of an expansion of airport capacity in the southeast of England, is to be sold by the company formerly known as BAA in a \u00a31.5bn deal. The sale of the UK's third largest airport to Manchester Airports Group (MAG) is expected to be completed by the end of February and marks the continued rise of the group, whose three existing airports and property business contribute around \u00a33.2bn to the UK. The breakup of BAA also continues apace as a result of the deal, which reduces the number of airports in the hands of the company from seven to four. The Competition Commission ruled in July 2011 that it should sell Stansted and either Glasgow or Edinburgh airport as part of a breakup which was resisted in a succession of ultimately unsuccessful legal challenges. But the company, which owns Heathrow, Southampton, Aberdeen and Glasgow, and announced in October that it was to change its name from BAA to Heathrow Airport Holdings, has announced that Stansted was being bought by MAG. Stansted, in Essex, which is London's third busiest airport and a major hub for budget airlines such as Ryanair, has been identified by London's mayor, Boris Johnson, as the only viable alternative to proposals to construct a \u00a350bn airport in the Thames estuary. The mayor, who is opposed to expansion at Heathrow in west London and said in October that he favoured an airport to the east of London, later suggested Stansted should be turned into a \"superhub\" airport with three extra runways and commissioned a feasibility study. The airport, which handles around 17.5 million passengers and more than 131,000 flights a year, posted pre-tax profits of \u00a386.6m in 2011.They were estimated to be \u00a394.2m in 2012. Colin Matthews, Heathrow chief executive and a BAA board member, said: \"Stansted airport and its people have been part of our company for a long time. \"It has been named by passengers as the world's best airport for low-cost airlines for two consecutive years at the Skytrax World Airport Awards, and we are proud of its achievements.\" He added: \"We wish the new owners every success and are confident the airport will continue to flourish.

It also runs businesses in car parking, airport security, firefighting, engineering, advertising and motor transport. BAA's airport ownership was brought into question when the Office of Fair Trading referred the company's holding to the Competition Commission which, after a long inquiry, ruled that BAA's airport ownership was uncompetitive. Criticising the company's performance, the commission said BAA had to sell Gatwick and Stansted and one of either Edinburgh or Glasgow airports. Gatwick had already been sold by the time of the ruling and since then BAA has sold Edinburgh. It held out for some time before finally accepting the ruling on Stansted \u2013 mounting a succession of ultimately unsuccessful legal challenges. MAG had been one of the bidders for Gatwick when BAA put it up for sale while the competition inquiry was going on but it lost out to American private equity group Global Infrastructure Partners which now also runs Edinburgh.",

      "bodyText": "Fears that Britain is heading for a triple-dip recession intensified on Friday amid news of a poor Christmas for retailers and concerns that heavy snow will lead to an economic shutdown over the coming days. City analysts pencilled in a small fall in national output for the final quarter of 2012 after the release of official data showing the volume of retail sales dipped by 0.1% between November and December, and by 0.6% between the third and fourth quarters of 2012. But there was also speculation that the arctic weather gripping much of the UK would result in a repeat of the closed factories and empty shopping malls of late 2010, which then contributed to a temporary plunge in activity. \"Given the UK's ability to grind to a halt with even a flake, the snow has come at a very brittle time for the UK economy, adding to the headwinds that it is already battling against as it tries to avoid a triple-dip recession,\" said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. \"The longer the snow and freezing conditions last, the greater will be the disruption to economic activity, and the bigger the risk that the first quarter of 2013 will see contraction in GDP following a likely renewed modest dip in the fourth quarter of 2012.\" Two quarters of consecutive declines in GDP would be needed for an unprecedented triple-dip recession, but the City was put on alert following data released by the Office for National Statistics showing a poor trading performance by retailers in the busiest shopping month of the year. Nick Parsons, head of strategy for National Australia Bank, said: \"We're looking for a -0.4% drop in GDP when the quarter four 2012 figures are published next week. The biggest threat to the first quarter of 2013 and the possibility of a triple-dip recession would be for a decent dump of snow to bring the UK economy grinding to a halt. Which is exactly what we've got.\" The seasonally adjusted drop in high-street and online retail activity followed a flat November and underlined the difficult trading conditions that have seen administrators called in to Jessops, HMV and Blockbuster within the past 10 days. Supermarkets, department stores and shops selling household goods all struggled, but discounting appeared to help clothing and footwear outlets. Although some stores reported a last-minute rush just before Christmas, the ONS data suggests hard-pressed consumers kept a tight rein on their spending. The figures, which cover the period until 29 December, show the boost to spending provided by the London Olympics proved to be shortlived, with activity in December barely higher than it was a year earlier and only 1.2% higher than when the recession was at its worst in 2009. Only strong sales of petrol following a fall in pump prices prevented a bigger monthly decline, the ONS said. Excluding fuel, there was a 0.3% reduction in retail sales in December. The ONS said online shopping made up an increasing share of retail sales, with more than 10% of the total accounted for by consumers using the internet, an increase of 1.2 percentage points on December 2011. Vicky Redwood, UK analyst at Capital Economics, said: \"December's drop in the official measure of UK retail sales volumes confirms the festive period was fairly lacklustre for the high street.\" Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange company World First, said: \"With the number of big high street names heading into administration in the past few weeks, we already knew this Christmas was not a kind one for the retail industry. Food and energy price inflation have hammered consumers' pockets and, apart from December 2010 (a very snowy month), this annual increase of 1.1% was the weakest since 1998. \"Sterling has come in for an absolute pasting in the past 24 hours, as investors positioned themselves for [these] retail sales numbers.\"",

      "body": "<p>Whole Foods is the supermarket of choice for the Prius-driving set. Which makes it all the more odd that its founder and CEO John Mackey is in the news for saying how much he hates Obama's Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>In the course of publicizing his new book, Conscious Capitalism: Liberating the Heroic Spirit of Business), on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/01/16/169413848/whole-foods-founder-john-mackey-on-fascism-and-conscious-capitalism\">NPR on Wednesday morning</a> Mackey, 59, used the words \"fascism\" and \"fascist\" to describe Obamacare. Specifically, he said: \"<strong>In fascism, the government doesn't own the means of production but they do control it and that's what's happening with the health care program with these reforms and so I'd say the system is becoming more fascist</strong>.\"</p> <p>Howls of outrage from across the land prompted Mackey to <a href=\"http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/mackey-regarding-word-choice-health-care\">make a partial retraction</a>.</p> <p>But this is not the first time Mackey's put his foot in his mouth. Here he is on unions: \"The union is like having herpes. It doesn't kill you, but it's unpleasant and inconvenient, and it stops a lot of people from becoming your lover.\"</p> <p>This is not the first time Mackey has complained about Obamacare either. Three years ago he wrote an<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204251404574342170072865070.html\"> op-ed about it in the Wall Street Journal</a>which began with the famous quote from Margaret Thatcher: \"The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-402662600\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/1/18/1358523881206/Whole-Foods-CEO-John-Mack-003.jpg\" alt=\"Whole Foods CEO John Mackey\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Mackey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In that piece he complained: \"The last thing our country needs is a massive new healthcare entitlement that will create hundreds of billions of dollars of new unfunded deficits and move us much closer to a government takeover of our healthcare system. Instead, we should be trying to achieve reforms by moving in the opposite direction \u2013 toward less government control and more individual empowerment.\"</p> <p>Huh? This is not the liberal point of view at all. We're confused. Is John Mackey a paradox? A hypocrite? A socialist? A libertarian? All of the above? Let me explore.</p> <p><strong>First of all, John Mackey is an employer.</strong> And by all accounts he's a good one. Whole Food ranks number 32 on Fortune's list of <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/best-companies/2012/snapshots/32.html\">Great Companies to Work For</a> because the company caps salaries of executives at 19 times the average full-time salary. Mackey has paid himself a token $1 a year since 2006. In a system picked by its employees, Whole Foods' free health insurance program gives everyone $1,800 a year to spend on health-related costs not provided by its insurance. What doesn't get spent rolls over.</p> <p>\"Once you start spending your own money instead of someone else's money you know to be more careful with it,\" he said on MSNBC on Friday morning.</p> <p><strong>Mackey is a businessman</strong>. Yes, he founded Whole Foods (motto: \"Whole Foods, Whole People, Whole Planet\") in 1980 to sell healthy, organic, unprocessed food. But the company grew to its enormous size because Mackey bought up smaller natural and health food stores round the country. He's like the Barnes and Noble of healthy shopping.</p> <p><strong>Mackey is a stockholder</strong>. Well he was. Six years ago he turned his entire Whole Foods stock portfolio over to a charitable foundation. Nonetheless he is CEO of a publicly traded company and keeps a sharp eye on the share price. Nothing to worry about there. Whole Foods currently trades at $90 a share. That's up from $50 10 years ago.</p> <p><strong>Mackey is a philosopher</strong>. That's what he studied at the University of Texas before dropping out, and it remains obvious in the way he thinks. The on-air use of the word fascist was stupid, but it doesn't reflect Mackey's overall thoughtful approach to his business practice and the responsibility he feels in running a large company.</p> <p><strong>Mackey was a hippie</strong>. He still is. Kind of. \"My search for meaning and purpose led me into the counterculture movement of the late 1960's and 1970's,\" he writes in his new book. \"I studied Eastern philosophy and religion at the time and still practice both yoga and meditation. I studied ecology. I became a vegetarian. (I have been vegan for 10 years.)\" Before starting Whole Foods (originally called Safer Way because of Safeway) Mackey has been an enthusiastic food co-op member.</p> <p><strong>Mackey is an entrepreneur</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Whole Foods is the supermarket of choice for the Prius-driving set. Which makes it all the more odd that its founder and CEO John Mackey is in the news for saying how much he hates Obama's Affordable Care Act. In the course of publicizing his new book, Conscious Capitalism: Liberating the Heroic Spirit of Business), on NPR on Wednesday morning Mackey, 59, used the words \"fascism\" and \"fascist\" to describe Obamacare. Specifically, he said: \"In fascism, the government doesn't own the means of production but they do control it and that's what's happening with the health care program with these reforms and so I'd say the system is becoming more fascist.\" Howls of outrage from across the land prompted Mackey to make a partial retraction. But this is not the first time Mackey's put his foot in his mouth. Here he is on unions: \"The union is like having herpes. It doesn't kill you, but it's unpleasant and inconvenient, and it stops a lot of people from becoming your lover.\" This is not the first time Mackey has complained about Obamacare either. Three years ago he wrote an op-ed about it in the Wall Street Journalwhich began with the famous quote from Margaret Thatcher: \"The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money.\" In that piece he complained: \"The last thing our country needs is a massive new healthcare entitlement that will create hundreds of billions of dollars of new unfunded deficits and move us much closer to a government takeover of our healthcare system. Instead, we should be trying to achieve reforms by moving in the opposite direction \u2013 toward less government control and more individual empowerment.\" Huh? This is not the liberal point of view at all. We're confused. Is John Mackey a paradox? A hypocrite? A socialist? A libertarian? All of the above? Let me explore. First of all, John Mackey is an employer. And by all accounts he's a good one. Whole Food ranks number 32 on Fortune's list of Great Companies to Work For because the company caps salaries of executives at 19 times the average full-time salary. Mackey has paid himself a token $1 a year since 2006. In a system picked by its employees, Whole Foods' free health insurance program gives everyone $1,800 a year to spend on health-related costs not provided by its insurance. What doesn't get spent rolls over. \"Once you start spending your own money instead of someone else's money you know to be more careful with it,\" he said on MSNBC on Friday morning. Mackey is a businessman. Yes, he founded Whole Foods (motto: \"Whole Foods, Whole People, Whole Planet\") in 1980 to sell healthy, organic, unprocessed food. But the company grew to its enormous size because Mackey bought up smaller natural and health food stores round the country. He's like the Barnes and Noble of healthy shopping. Mackey is a stockholder. Well he was. Six years ago he turned his entire Whole Foods stock portfolio over to a charitable foundation. Nonetheless he is CEO of a publicly traded company and keeps a sharp eye on the share price. Nothing to worry about there. Whole Foods currently trades at $90 a share. That's up from $50 10 years ago. Mackey is a philosopher. That's what he studied at the University of Texas before dropping out, and it remains obvious in the way he thinks. The on-air use of the word fascist was stupid, but it doesn't reflect Mackey's overall thoughtful approach to his business practice and the responsibility he feels in running a large company. Mackey was a hippie. He still is. Kind of. \"My search for meaning and purpose led me into the counterculture movement of the late 1960's and 1970's,\" he writes in his new book. \"I studied Eastern philosophy and religion at the time and still practice both yoga and meditation. I studied ecology. I became a vegetarian. (I have been vegan for 10 years.)\" Before starting Whole Foods (originally called Safer Way because of Safeway) Mackey has been an enthusiastic food co-op member. Mackey is an entrepreneur. He prides himself as never having taken a business class. He believes in the spirit of innovation. He is a free-market thinker who has made his peace with the fact he is a businessman and a capitalist. Not perfect he says but \"fundamentally good and ethical.\" Mackey is a dreamer. He can use the word \"love\" in the same sentence as the word \"stakeholder\", and he's on a mission to tell us that business needs to discover a higher purpose other than just making money. \"Business does great good in the world,\" he says bemoaning the fact that it shares the same approval rating as Congress. It \"can be a wonderful vehicle for both personal and organizational learning and growth\". Mackey can be a bit sneaky. Using the pseudonym \"Rahodeb\" (an anagram of his wife's name, Deborah) he spent seven years posting to Yahoo Finance forums as a critic of the rival supermarket chain Wild Oats Markets \u2013 which he was trying to buy. He succeeded in 2007 and subsequently said the posts were a mistake in judgement, but not ethics. (According to The New Yorker, he would compliment his own appearance, \"I think he looks cute,\" he wrote about himself.) Mackey is very, very rich yet genuinely doesn't seem to care about his money. Having sold Whole Foods stock over the years, Mackey is worth millions and millions of dollars, but lives a life of abstinence, flying commercial, backpacking for fun and driving a Honda. Mackey doesn't believe in the science behind climate change and anyway thinks it will be good for the economy. Yet since 2006 Whole Foods has offset 100 percent of its energy cost with the purchase of wind power credits. Mackey IS Whole Foods. He doesn't have children and sees himself as the 'daddy' of his every member of his vast company. If you find it contradictory to hate him but love what he's created, don't worry \u2013 Mackey will understand.",

Giles Tremlett writes from Madrid: Just as Portugal was looking forward to shaking off its bailout masters, the gloom in northern Europe has become the biggest risk to its future. The IMF today praised Portugal's own behaviour in cutting deficits and introducing reforms since it became beholden to the troika of the IMF, European Central Bank and the European Commission after requesting a \u20ac78bn bailout in May, 2011. But it also pointed out that, without help from the rest of Europe, Portugal's attempts at standing on its own feet again may be defeated. \u201cPortugal is heading for a return to growth by the end of this year but one of the biggest risks to its future is the downturn in the rest of Europe,\u201d the report said. The Bank of Portugal recently said this year's recession would be worse than expected, mainly because of lower growth in Germany and the rest of Europe. It now sees the economy contracting by 1.9%, or twice the previous estimate \u2013 giving Portugal a third consecutive year of job-destroying recession. The IMF also said the behaviour of eurozone leaders, who are promising fiscal union, will also impact Portugal's recovery. \u201cDomestic efforts will need to be complemented by reforms of euro area arrangements to clear a path not only toward a durable return to market financing for Portugal but also to avoid a repeat of the build-up of unsustainable imbalances,\u201d it said. The IMF itself recently admitted underestimating the damage that austerity had done to troubled euro zone countries. In a conference call, IMF mission chief Abebe Aemro Selassie told The Guardian that this thinking had already been factored in to relaxed budget deficit-reduction targets for Portugal this year. Prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho recently declared growth would return in 2014. But the IMF does not see growth climbing higher than 2% before 2017 \u2013 by which time Portugal will have experienced a lost decade with zero real term growth since 2007. There's some tough language in the IMF report on Greece (see below), including this: The fiscal adjustment has relied far too much on cuts in discretionary spending and increased taxation of wage earners, while the rich and self-employed have continued to evade taxes on an astonishing scale and bloated and unproductive state sectors have seen only limited cuts. Portugal has apparently embarked on an investor roadshow in the US ahead of issuing a syndicated bond. According to Reuters, the week and a half trip will explain Portugal's debt strategy and so far investor reaction has been positive. Despite fairly upbeat comments on Greece earlier from Christine Lagarde, there are rather more mixed noises now from the IMF. The IMF has estimated that Greece faces a funding gap of \u20ac5.5bn to \u20ac9.5bn for 2015 and 2016, the first time it has put a figure on the country's financing needs beyond 2014. This contrasts with the EU, which estimated the amount at the lower end of that range at \u20ac5.6bn. Here's the latest IMF report on the country. IMF mission chief for Greece Poul Thomsen said the fund had received promises from its European partners that they would continue to support Greece \"even if they are not concrete about it.\" According to Reuters Thomsen said there was renewed interest in Greece from investors but challenges remained. The Greek government was determined to deal with tax evasion but so far the IMF had not seen any significant impact on tax collections. There were also reports the IMF wants haircuts on bilateral Greek loans from Europe, meaning another loss which could put investors off. Thomsen also said the Greek economy was becoming more competitive, while the IMF reported put out some new GDP estimates for the country: And still with Cyprus, Moody's had downgraded the country's covered bonds to CAA1. Cyprus finance minister Vassos Shiarly said the island had formally requested a five year extension from Russia to repay a \u20ac2.5bn loan due in 2016. In an interview with Reuters he also said the private sector writedown of Greek debt in early 2012 was a mistake because of the upheaval it caused in the eurozone. Cyprus is waiting for its own bailout, and Shiarly said he did not rule out privatisations if that was needed to seal the deal. He said: The Greek [debt writedown] was a gift to Greece. We are not asking for a gift. We are asking for understanding, and a loan on fair terms so we can overcome these financial difficulties we are facing at the moment. The island's banks were hit by the write-down of Greek debt, leading to it asking for financial help from the EU and IMF in June last year. Back with Italy, and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is narrowing the gap in opinion polls. Pier Luigi Bersani's centre-left coalition is still leading the way, but Berlusconi is now 6 percentage points behind, a 4 percentage point improvement on a week ago. As Reuters points out: Berlusconi extended his surge in Italy's opinion polls on Friday, increasing prospects that the centre-left Democratic Party now leading the race will have to seek a pact with Mario Monti's centrist bloc. Well, well... US consumer sentiment fell for the second month running, to reach its lowest level since December 2011. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index came in at 71.3 for January, down from 72.9 the previous month and below estimates of around 75. The recent fiscal cliff standoff seemed to do much of the damage to confidence, the survey indicated. Michael Woolfolk at BNY Mellon in New York told Reuters: It's a January figure, therefore it's more important than those from other months because we are curious to know what the impact on consumers will be from the hike in the social security tax. That is undoubtedly going to hit discretionary spending. So this may be a signal of things to come. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy was more positive: [The] survey doesn't seem to be justified by fundamentals. Some uncertainties with regards to the future outlook remain but we suspect part of the decline in household confidence will be corrected in the coming weeks as the moderate recovery story is still valid. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has not really been moved by the report, currently up around 4 points or so. Former finance minister George Papaconstantinou has issued a statement following parliament\u2019s decision to investigate him for his handling of the infamous Lagarde list. Helena Smith writes: Papaconstantinou\u2019s reaction has been swift and to the point. In a sign of the defense he is likely to take, the ex-economics chief said he was \u201cat the disposal\u201d of the special parliamentary committee which, as of Monday, will begin probing allegations that he not only doctored the list, deleting the names of relatives, but failed to pursue tax evaders. \u201cThe only thing that I want is to be given the opportunity to clear my name from the gross fabrication against me,\u201d he said, \u201cand for accountability to be attributed where it should be.\u201d Wading into the furore over the list which bears her name, Christine Lagarde who has been busy speaking with a number of Greek media outlets this week, told MEGA TV that at Papaconstantinou\u2019s request she handed him the list because he seemed determined \"to pursue every avenue\" in the battle against tax evasion. \u201cNot enough has been done,\u201d she said turning to the subject of tax avoidance. \u201cWhen we look at revenue it is not on target,\u201d she added, exhorting the government to get serious about rooting out tax dodgers if it wanted to receive further finance assistance from the IMF. \u201cI have a long-standing affection for your country,\u201d she said predicting that if Greece continued to enforce reforms it would balance its books this year and see growth in 2014. Now French finance minister Pierre Moscovici is speaking (although not in Paris, he's in Dublin). France will be unable to return to growth unless the euro area pulls out of recession he says. The eurozone is in better shape and there are no doubts about its future existence, he adds. And with that I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. [Apologies for the repetition, my colleague Nick Fletcher kindly covered this for the first time while I was at lunch - JM] Over to Paris, where European Central Bank board member Benoit Coure has been speaking at an economic forum. Banks will continue to need recourse to European Central Bank refinancing this year despite a stabilisaiton of the crisis, he said. He also ECB decisions were not the key element in solving the crisis, but rather governments carrying out reforms. The resolution of the eurozone crisis does not mainly depend on regulatory decisions nor decisions taken by the ECB. It depends mainly on the will and commitment of states to reform their economies, on the one hand, and on the other, to improve the functioning of the eurozone, which is to say the institutions that allow it to be more resilient to shocks like those we've seen since 2007. Depressing news from Greece (which, RobertSchuman, I would say is worse than gloomy or miserable, but less economics-related), where reports have surfaced that a tree Plato apparently sat under has been chopped down for firewood. Christina Flora writes on the blog Greek Reporter: Greeks, desperate to find fuel to stay warm because they can\u2019t afford heating oil that has been hit with big tax increases, have been taking to the woods and even city parks to cut down trees and now authorities said someone has felled the olive tree under which Plato sat in ancient times. Police said they believe at least two people cut down the famous tree because it was massive and heavy. Some residents of the area reportedly said that homeless people cut the tree, while others allege that a group of gypsies did it. Plato\u2019s Olive Tree, was said to be a remnant of the grove within which Plato\u2019s Academy was situated, which would make it approximately 2,400 years old. Our correspondent in Greece, Helena Smith, wrote about the rise of illegal logging back in November last year. The Bank of Italy has cut its economic forecast for the country. It now expects a drop of 1% for 2013, compared to a previous forecast of a 0.2% decline,l made three months ago. The concensus forecast had been for a fall of 0.9%. It said the international environment had worsened and credit conditions were still restrictive. The Bank expects a recovery in the second half, paving the way for growth to resume in 2014. Not good news for whoever does come out on top in the forthcoming elections. Banks will continue to need access to European Central Bank funding despite an easing of the debt crisis, said one of its board members. Speaking at a conference in Paris, Benoit Coeure said, according to Reuters: Refinancing at the central bank will remain an important factor of security throughout 2013. He added that a resolution of the crisis did not hinge on ECB decisions, but on reforms by the states. Over to Greece, where the decision to investigate former finance minister George Papaconstantinou has been met with thinly veiled disgust, says Helena Smith our correspondent in Athens. She writes: Far from bringing the much touted \u201ccatharsis\u201d that Greece\u2019s political elite had promised, parliament\u2019s handling of the notorious Lagarde list has exacerbated the widespread distrust Greeks have in their institutions. Hopes had been high that after three years of ruthless austerity, the \u201clittle man\u201d would finally see the establishment assume a modicum of responsibility for the country\u2019s economic mess. The tally of suspected tax evaders \u2013 well-heeled Greeks who had chosen to squirrel their hoards away in the Geneva branch of HSBC \u2013 highlighted the inequities of the debt crisis precisely because successive governments had failed to act on it. For many, the so-called Lagarde list amplified, in the most egregious way, an indisputable fact: that while low-income Greeks and pensioners have paid a heavy price for the crisis, the rich have got off scot-free. After yesterday\u2019s marathon 16-hour debate, it is the high drama that marked the debate, and the way the vote was conducted, that has left a bitter taste. \u201cIt was pure theatre that, at this stage, society has no tolerance for,\u201d Spyros Soumelidis, who edits the daily newspaper Greece Tomorrow, told the state-run TV channel NET. Ordinary Greeks might not have been convinced by Papaconstantinou\u2019s line of defence \u2013 not least his claims that it would have been \u201cidiotic\u201d to delete the names of relatives from data. But after last night\u2019s parliamentary antics, many believe he is being made the fall-guy by a fragile government determined to save its own skin by orchestrating a vote that spared Papconstantinou's successor, the socialist Pasok leader, Evangelos Venizelos, from also being investigated. Opposition saw an inquiry of Venizelos as imperative, as he also failed to act on the list. \u201cIn parliament yesterday, the government majority won [along with] the cover-up of the scandalous handling of the Lagarde list,\u201d said Dimitris Papadimoulis, parliamentary representative of the radical left main opposition Syriza party. \u201cBut society lost and it lost overwhelmingly,\u201d he said. The chance to get to the bottom of tax evasion \u2013 the single biggest drain on the debt-choked Greek economy \u2013 had been lost. And with it a real catharsis, or clean-up, of Greece's corrupt political scene. David Cameron's no-show in Amsterdam (see 7.52am) has prompted plenty of reaction, none better than the poem by reader ratherbered, in the comments below. So Farewell Then David Cameron You so nearly Scored A great own goal But Just before the ball Came across The ref Abandoned the match Now today your coach says Cameron has a badly Twisted tongue And is out for the rest Of the season Apologies to E.J.Thribb (17) Great stuff. Thank you! More from Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, who said there is no plan to boost the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund for a direct recapitalisation of eurozone banks. The Bank of England must keep an open mind on new and unorthodox stimulus tools, said the newest member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, Ian McCafferty. McCafferty appears to have broken his own embargo, appearing on Bloomberg TV to talk about his first speech in the job which, according to the press release, was... NOT FOR RELEASE BEFORE 12:00 HRS (GMT) ON FRIDAY 18 JANUARY 2013. Ah well, we'll have a full story on the speech online shortly, but not before 12pm. Back to the race to the head of the Eurogroup. Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, who has long supported Jeroen Dijsslebloem for the post, said this morning that the group would decide on its new leader on Monday. There will not, however, be a decision on Cyprus aid on Monday, he said. IMF chief Christine Lagarde says the Greek economy should grow next year, and the stricken country will be able to return to international debt markets by 2016. In an interview with Kathimerini\u2019s editor-in-chief Alexis Papachelas on Skai TV\u2019s New Files, she said that no new austerity measures would be required if structural reforms are implemented. Our analysis is that if the structural reforms are conducted and therefore if there is a proper transmission of the salary cost reduction into prices, no additional cost reduction or pension reduction will be needed. If, however, the structural reforms were not to take place, if the closed professions were to maintain their privilege, if the multiple licenses, bureaucratic hurdles and impediments to growth were to stay, then we would face another situation where the fiscal deficit needs to be tackled and therefore more cuts would be needed. Back to the UK and the tumbling pound. Sterling fell on the gloomy retail sales data, to hit an eight-week low against the dollar. Independent economist Shaun Richards asked earlier this week if this would be the year the pound collapses. His conclusions (pre-today's data)... If you look at the UK economy in isolation it is easy to argue that the pounds value should fall. The catch is when you ask against what exactly? He asked again on Twitter today, if everyone was now down on the \u00a3 as a result of retail sales. Some early responses... With the ongoing tax scandal in Greece, it seems Spain now has one brewing of its own. Our correspondent in Madrid, Giles Tremlett, writes: Spain's prime minister Mariano Rajoy was in ebullient form in an interview with the Financial Times this week, proclaiming that: \u201cThe second half of 2013 is when we will start to see a recovery, and it will come through very clearly in 2014.\u201d But now he has a full-grown domestic political crisis on his hands \u2013 with El Mundo newspaper (paywall) revealing that, as recently as 2009, his party was part-paying salaries to senior officials in black money. A \u20ac22m Swiss account controlled by former party treasurer Luis Barcenas is at the centre of the scandal. As austerity bites, taxes rise and services are cut, Spaniards will want to know \u2013 if the allegations are true \u2013 why Rajoy's party felt it did not have to pay taxes and why it was allowed to happen while the prime minister was party boss. For the moment, party officials deny wrongdoing. But Rajoy's biggest rival in the party, Esperanza Aguire, has already come out fighting, calling it a \u201cgrave institutional crisis\u201d. \"The courts should act, interrogating whoever needs to be questioned and whoever falls must fall. And quickly.\u201d Could she be talking about Rajoy? My colleague Larry Elliot has the following take on retail sales, up online shortly. He writes: Britain\u2019s retailers endured a tough Christmas with the volume of retail sales falling by 0.1% in the busiest shopping month of the year, the office for national statistics said. High street and online spending in the three months to December - a better guide to the underlying trend - fell by 0.6%, a weak performance that will intensify City speculation that the economy contracted in the last quarter of 2012. Supermarkets, department stores and stores selling household goods all struggled, but discounting appeared to help clothing and footwear outlets. Although some stores reported a last-minute rush to the shops in the days before Christmas, the ONS data suggests that hard-pressed consumers kept a tight rein on their spending. The official figures cover the period up until December 29. Only strong sales of petrol following a fall in pump prices prevented a bigger monthly decline, the ONS said. Excluding fuel there was a 0.3% reduction in retail sales in December. The strong performance of internet sales is, of course, at least part of the reason that Britain's high streets are undergoing such dramatic change. HMV, Comet, Jessops and Blockbuster all cited the influence of the internet in their demise. Early reaction to the UK retail sales (see below), is pretty downbeat. Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics say the figures point to Britain's economy shrinking in the fourth quarter. If we haven't said it enough times already, that puts Britain on the road to an unprecedented triple-dip recession. Anyway, Redwood said: Sales in Q4 as a whole were down by 0.6% - yet another bit of evidence that the economy probably contracted at the end of last year. Online sales were unsurprisingly the strongest performing sector. Clothing did ok too. But food, department store and household goods sales all dropped. At least the \u201csales\u201d period at the start of January has reportedly been reasonably strong. And growth of the retail sales deflator in December was broadly steady \u2013 supporting other evidence that retailers held back from any panicked price discounting and so preserved their margins. Nonetheless, with consumers\u2019 real pay still falling, demand on the high street is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future. And there are some miserable retail sales figures out of the UK. The Office for National Statistics said retail sales (excluding fuel) dropped 0.3% in December, compared with expectations of a 0.1% increase. That annual increase of 1.1% was the weakest since 1998. Household goods suffered the biggest decline on the month, with sales dropping 3% from November. Over the year, clothing and footwear was the worst performer (if you ignore fuel), with sales down by 3.5%. Internet sales were still rising though, with 10.6% of all purchases in December made online rather than in the shops. That's 1.2% higher than December 2011. Over to Spain, where there's gloomy news out of the central bank. Bad loans in the stricken country rose to 11.4% in November \u2013 a new high \u2013 from 11.2% in October. The Bank of Spain said loans that fell into arrears rose to \u20ac191.6bn in November. David Cameron may have postponed his speech (see 7.52am) but he can't escape the thorny subject of Europe. Last night, US president Barack Obama brought it up again. During a conversation about the Algeria hostage crisis, Obama told the prime minister that he \u201cvalues a strong UK in a strong European Union\". Greeks are struggling to get to work in Athens again today, as the metro workers host a second day of strikes in protest against government plans to cut wages. Now ekathimerini is reporting that metro employees are mulling the possibility of carrying out rolling 24-hour strikes. Speaking to Skai TV, the head of the SELMA union of metro workers, Manthos Tsakos, said that the option of a long-term strike is being examined by employees. There's more jostling for position over the upcoming vacancy as head of the group of eurozone finance ministers. Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is seen as the frontrunner for the Eurogroup job, will present his road map for the eurozone at a meeting of finance chiefs on January 21, according to reports. Luxembourg prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker, how currently heads up the group, told Germany\u2019s DPA news agency that Dijsselbloem will explain \u201chow he intends to craft the itinerary for the next few years.\u201d Juncker said: There\u2019s a desire, and this desire is understandable, that the upcoming Eurogroup chief submit a program. I did that in January 2010. As reader northland noted yesterday, French finance minister Pierre Moscovici has raised concerns about the process used to find the new Eurogroup head. Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported yesterday that Moscovici had criticized Dijsselbloem for not having outlined his vision for economic and financial policies, and said a decision on the position would not be made until February. Also overnight, China released mixed GDP data. On the one hand, it showed the economy sliding to its slowest growth in 13 years. On the other hand, growth picked up in the final quarter, fuelling hopes that the world's second largest economy is emerging from the slump. The boost was driven by state investment in infrastructure projects and efforts to get consumers and companies to spend. Government figures showed growth picked up to 7.9% in the final three months of 2012, from 7.4% in the previous quarter. For the full year, China recorded growth of 7.8% (which sounds pretty healthy, compared with predictions that the UK economy was flat last year). Dariusz Kowalczyk, an economist at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole in Hong Kong, said the growth data \u201cwas the best we could have wished for\u201d. There have been fears that China would suffer a sharp slowdown, as global turmoil, feeble domestic demand and a weak property market weighed on growth. But Kowalczyk said these figures suggested China had comfortably escaped a so-called hard landing. In case you're wondering what's happened to my colleague Graeme Wearden, he has turned his attention to the snow blanketing parts of the UK, on the Guardian's live blog of transport disruptions and general weather-inspired chaos. It will, at least, put him in the mood for Davos, where he will be live-blogging direct from the World Economic Forum next week. Otherwise, this morning we've got retail sales figures out of the UK and there are some speeches to watch out for later in the day. Italy industrial figures for November: 9am UK retail sales for December: 9.30am Merkel and EU parliament president Schulz meet in Berlin: 9.30am ECB's Coeure speaks in Paris: 11am Bank of England's McCafferty speaks in London: 12pm Berlusconi appears on Canale 5: 8.10pm In the debt markets, the UK will sell \u00a32.5bn of Treasury bills. The other big story this morning is David Cameron's decision to delay his statement on Britain's future in the European Union after abandoning a trip to the Netherlands to deal with the Algerian hostage crisis. My colleagues Nicholas Watt and Juliette Jowit report: Downing Street indicated that the prime minister would deliver his speech, in which he planned to warn that Britain could \"drift towards the exit\" unless powers are handed back from the EU, once the hostage crisis had ended. The postponement was announced shortly before the prime minister was due to fly to meet the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, before his speech in Amsterdam... Cameron had been due to warn his fellow European leaders that British membership of the EU could be put at risk unless its membership terms are changed. \"If we don't address these challenges, the danger is that Europe will fail and the British people will drift towards the exit,\" Cameron was due to say in the speech to an audience of business leaders in Amsterdam. \"There is a growing frustration that the EU is seen as something that is done to people rather than acting on their behalf. And this is being intensified by the very solutions required to resolve the economic problems. \"People are increasingly frustrated that decisions taken further and further away from them mean their living standards are slashed through enforced austerity or their taxes are used to bail out governments on the other side of the continent.\" Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. Greek politicians were busy last night as they discussed whether to investigate four former ministers for their handling of the explosive 'Lagarde list' of potential tax evaders. It was a long night and the parliamentarians finally voted at 2am to investigate former finance minister George Papaconstantinou, who was expelled from the socialist PASOK party after names of three of his relatives were deleted from the list. In a relief for the government, the politicians voted against a motion to investigate socialist chief Evangelos Venizelos, who is one of three coalition members. Former prime ministers Lucas Papademos, a technocrat, and George Papandreou, a Socialist, also escaped an inquiry. Christine Lagarde handed the list of about 2,000 Greeks with money stashed in Switzerland to Athens in 2010, when she was French finance minister. But its existence only became publicly known in September last year. Since then, the scandal has preoccupied Greece, where tax evasion is a major factor in the country's financial crisis. There is already a huge distrust in politicians, made worse by revelations that the list was misplaced, locked away in a cabinet, copied and tampered with. We'll have all the reaction to the vote today, including the latest developments in the eurozone and beyond.",

The IMF today praised Portugal's own behaviour in cutting deficits and introducing reforms since it became beholden to the troika of the IMF, European Central Bank and the European Commission after requesting a \u20ac78bn bailout in May, 2011. But it also pointed out that, without help from the rest of Europe, Portugal's attempts at standing on its own feet again may be defeated.</p> <p>\u201cPortugal is heading for a return to growth by the end of this year but one of the biggest risks to its future is the downturn in the rest of Europe,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The Bank of Portugal recently said this year's recession would be worse than expected, mainly because of lower growth in Germany and the rest of Europe. It now sees the economy contracting by 1.9%, or twice the previous estimate \u2013 giving Portugal a third consecutive year of job-destroying recession.</p> <p>The IMF also said the behaviour of eurozone leaders, who are promising fiscal union, will also impact Portugal's recovery. \u201cDomestic efforts will need to be complemented by reforms of euro area arrangements to clear a path not only toward a durable return to market financing for Portugal but also to avoid a repeat of the build-up of unsustainable imbalances,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The IMF itself recently admitted underestimating the damage that austerity had done to troubled euro zone countries. In a conference call, IMF mission chief Abebe Aemro Selassie told The Guardian that this thinking had already been factored in to relaxed budget deficit-reduction targets for Portugal this year.</p> <p>Prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho recently declared growth would return in 2014. But the IMF does not see growth climbing higher than 2% before 2017 \u2013 by which time Portugal will have experienced a lost decade with zero real term growth since 2007.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50f981b0b579240893bf5222\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-18T17:09:04.161Z\">5.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There's some tough language in the IMF report on Greece (see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/18/eurozone-crisis-live-greece-probe-ex-finance-minister#block-50f9721295cb5d055131b74f\">below</a>), including this:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fiscal adjustment has relied far too much on cuts in discretionary spending and increased taxation of wage earners, while the rich and self-employed have continued to evade taxes on an astonishing scale and bloated and unproductive <br>state sectors have seen only limited cuts.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50f978c995cb5d055131b752\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-18T16:31:05.652Z\">4.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Portugal on US roadshow to explain debt strategy</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Portugal has apparently embarked on an investor roadshow in the US ahead of issuing a syndicated bond.</p> <p>According to Reuters, the week and a half trip will explain Portugal's debt strategy and so far investor reaction has been positive.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50f9721295cb5d055131b74f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-18T16:02:26.471Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">IMF says Greece faces funding gap of up to \u20ac9,5bn for 2015.16</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Despite fairly upbeat comments on Greece <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/18/eurozone-crisis-live-greece-probe-ex-finance-minister#block-50f92730b579240893bf51d5\">earlier</a> from Christine Lagarde, there are rather more mixed noises now from the IMF.</p> <p>The IMF has estimated that Greece faces a funding gap of \u20ac5.5bn to \u20ac9.5bn for 2015 and 2016, the first time it has put a figure on the country's financing needs beyond 2014.

Supermarkets, department stores and stores selling household goods all struggled, but discounting appeared to help clothing and footwear outlets.</p> <p>Although some stores reported a last-minute rush to the shops in the days before Christmas, the ONS data suggests that hard-pressed consumers kept a tight rein on their spending. The official figures cover the period up until December 29.</p> <p>Only strong sales of petrol following a fall in pump prices prevented a bigger monthly decline, the ONS said.

If we haven't said it enough times already, <strong>that puts Britain on the road to an unprecedented triple-dip recession.</strong></p> <p>Anyway, Redwood said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sales in Q4 as a whole were down by 0.6% - yet another bit of evidence that the economy probably contracted at the end of last year. Online sales were unsurprisingly the strongest performing sector. Clothing did ok too. But food, department store and household goods sales all dropped.</p> <p>At least the \u201csales\u201d period at the start of January has reportedly been reasonably strong. And growth of the retail sales deflator in December was broadly steady \u2013 supporting other evidence that retailers held back from any panicked price discounting and so preserved their margins. Nonetheless, with consumers\u2019 real pay still falling, demand on the high street is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/status/292203510483787777\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The UK Retail Sales figures look as cold as the weather and we are in a grim run but take care as they can be erratic. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23business\">#business</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23gfc2\">#gfc2</a></p>&mdash; Shaun Richards (@notayesmansecon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/status/292203510483787777\" data-datetime=\"2013-01-18T09:35:20+00:00\">January 18, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50f91848b579240893bf51c6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-18T09:39:20.279Z\">9.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK retail sales miss forecasts</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And there are some miserable retail sales figures out of the UK. <strong>The Office for National Statistics said retail sales (excluding fuel) dropped 0.3% in December, compared with expectations of a 0.1% increase.</strong></p> <p><strong>That annual increase of 1.1% was the weakest since 1998. </strong>Household goods suffered the biggest decline on the month, with sales dropping 3% from November.

Former prime ministers Lucas Papademos, a technocrat, and George Papandreou, a Socialist, also escaped an inquiry.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde handed the list of about 2,000 Greeks with money stashed in Switzerland to Athens in 2010, when she was French finance minister. But its existence only became publicly known in September last year.</p> <p>Since then, the scandal has preoccupied Greece, where tax evasion is a major factor in the country's financial crisis. There is already a huge distrust in politicians, made worse by revelations that the list was misplaced, locked away in a cabinet, copied and tampered with.</p> <p>We'll have all the reaction to the vote today, including the latest developments in the eurozone and beyond.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-01-18T08:36:17.969Z\">at 8.36am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Fortnum's pre-tax profits collapsed from \u00a31.1m to \u00a3313,000 in the year to July 2012 after embarrassing technical \"glitches\" paralysed the Piccadilly emporium's delivery system. Wealthy families and companies \u2013 who favour Fortnum hampers as corporate Christmas gifts \u2013 were left waiting for the hampers, costing up to \u00a35,000 each and including Christmas puddings with goldleaf almonds, until weeks after Christmas 2011. The luxury retailer, which traces its roots back to 1707, declined to state how much it paid in compensation but a source close to the company said much of the \u00a3800,000 drop in profits was due to the payouts. A Fortnum spokesman said the company wrote to every customer to apologise for the failed deliveries, but acknowledged that some customers refused to shop with Fortnum again despite the compensation. \"Glitches with the new warehouse systems installed in summer/autumn 2011 led to the delays to hamper deliveries that year,\" the spokesman said. \"The firm has invested \u00a33m in new systems and training which are now working efficiently.\" The spokesman said Fortnum did not believe that publicity surrounding its occupation by UK Uncut protesters against claims of corporate tax avoidance negatively affected either trading or profits. Fortnum's sales rose by 9% over the year to 15 July 2012 to \u00a359.9m. The accounts reveal that Beverly Aspinall, Fortnum's former managing director who left the firm shortly after the hamper fiasco, received a \u00a3360,000 payoff.

Bentley's US sales were up 23% last year with 2,315 cars delivered. Almost as many Bentleys were sold in China last year, where sales were also up 23%. Even in Europe sales were up 12%.

The Quattroporte went ever so slightly more mainstream in the 1980s with the Quattroporte III, \"the businessman's Maserati\". Sales between 1979 and 1989 were a little over 2,000 units.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Seth Freedman, the whistleblower at the centre of energy market manipulation allegations, has been sacked by his price reporting agency, ICIS Heren. Freedman's concerns about unusual movements in the wholesale gas trade triggered investigations \u2013 which are ongoing \u2013 by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), and the energy regulator, Ofgem. Freedman said his sacking was \"classic victimisation and intimidation of a whistleblower\". \"[They're] protecting the management at the expense of those lower down the food chain,\" he said. \"I feel victimised for blowing the whistle. \"I was doing the right thing. I was protecting the ICIS brand \u2013 when we spot abuse we take it to the regulator. [But] I was treated as if I was the bad guy. It's outrageous.\" ICIS said it was forced to remove Freedman because he had lost the trust of price reporting agencies (PRAs) and his colleagues. The company said it had offered Freedman three alternative posts within the wider Reed Business Information publishing house, but he declined all the offers and was fired on 28 December. \"Seth Freedman is no longer employed at ICIS. Reed Business Information offered him three other roles on the same terms and conditions within the company, including one at the New Scientist, but he declined them all,\" a company spokesman said. Freedman said the other jobs had \"no relevance to my experience or skills\". He said his \"victimisation\" may make other ICIS staff too scared to speak up if they spot wrongdoing at the company, which is part of publishing giant Reed Elsevier. Freedman's lawyer, Shah Qureshi of Bindmans, said it \"beggars belief\" that ICIS had dismissed \"the very person who raised issues of alleged wrongdoing\". \"In his role as a gas price market analyst and guideline price setter he discovered market irregularities and evidence of market manipulation,\" he said. \"He brought those concerns to his employer's attention and when he felt nothing was being done he raised these issues of public importance with the regulators; the FSA and Ofgem.\" Qureshi said it was ironic ICIS was claiming Freedman was dismissed due to lack of trust and confidence, given that ICIS had confirmed his dismissal to the media while an appeal was pending. \"My client will be considering his legal options,\" he added. Freedman joined ICIS as a UK wholesale gas price reporter in January 2012 but raised the alarm about wild gyrations in the unregulated and over-the-counter (OTC) gas market, particularly on 28 September. He took his concerns about these day-ahead trades to ICIS, who later reported them to Ofgem but, fearing inaction on the issue, he later himself went directly to the FSA in the middle of November. \"Traders have made clear to me that manipulation of gas prices is taking place on a regular basis. They name big companies among those they accuse of trying to rig prices and reap profits. Market participants claim the fixing of prices is an open secret,\" he said at the time. But Freedman was also critical of PRAs, saying key benchmark indices they produced in massive UK supply contracts were unreliable, undermined by poorly trained staff and cosy relationships between traders and price reporters. The investigations by the FSA and Ofgem are expected to continue for months, while the government was quick to state that anyone found guilty of market rigging would be suitably punished. The big six energy companies have all denied they have been engaged in anything illegal. Citigroup, the only company to confirm it traded at the low price levels that aroused the suspicion of Freedman, has said it was acting in good faith on behalf of an unnamed energy client.",
