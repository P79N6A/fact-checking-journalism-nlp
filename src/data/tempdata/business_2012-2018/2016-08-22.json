      "bodyText": "The sharp drop in the pound has attracted tourists to the UK on shopping sprees, driving a jump in tax-free spending by overseas visitors, according to industry figures. The tax-free shopping company Global Blue said visitors from Asia and the US have been taking advantage of how much further their own currencies will go in the UK since the June referendum. It reported a 7% year-on-year increase in UK international tax-free shopping in July. Japan, Indonesia and the US were the nations that accounted for the biggest increase. Despite Japan\u2019s own economic problems, spending by Japanese visitors was up 96% in the UK compared with July 2015, while travellers from Indonesia spent 88% more than last year on tax-free shopping. Chinese tourists\u2019 spending was up just 6% for July, but the country still accounted for the largest portion of spending overall, with a 32% share. The figures echo comments by the Office for National Statistics last week that there were signs the fall in the pound since the referendum, which has made holidaying in the UK cheaper for overseas visitors, had attracted tourists on shopping sprees for luxury goods. Sales of watches and jewellery in July were up 16.6% on the same month last year, according to those official figures. That tourist boost combined with better sales of summer clothes to help drive an overall bounce in retail sales in July. Global Blue, which works with retailers, brands and hotels around the world, said travellers from the US also capitalised on the dollar\u2019s strength against the pound. The pound has dropped about 12% since the referendum on 23 June. In July US visitors\u2019 average spending in the UK rose 22% year on year to \u00a3734. Global Blue noted smaller growth in July from Middle Eastern visitors and put that down to the late timing of Ramadan this year. But Qatar remained the nation with the highest average spend per transaction for July, at \u00a31,642. Gordon Clark, Global Blue\u2019s UK and Ireland managing director, said the pound\u2019s fall had proved perfect timing for tourists visiting the UK this summer. \u201cThe cash injection we have seen off the back of this has been hugely beneficial for our tourism economy,\u201d he said. There have also been reports from hotels of a jump in tourist spending since the referendum. Edwardian Hotels London said it had seen a 31% increase in the value of reservations since the referendum. People were taking advantage of the weaker pound to stay in more expensive rooms and suites, said Linton Wadsworth, director of revenue at the company, which has 12 hotels in London and Manchester. \u201cThe US market is second to the domestic traveller for us so it\u2019s reassuring to see that even in an election year which notoriously reduces outbound travel for Americans, that London is enjoying such a bumper summer holiday season,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has been heavily criticised by its own shareholders and corporate governance experts after it emerged that the sportswear retailer pays an obscure company owned by Mike Ashley\u2019s brother to deliver online orders outside the UK. One of Sports Direct\u2019s biggest 10 shareholders said the arrangement with John Ashley \u201cdoesn\u2019t look very good\u201d, while Royal London Asset Management said it had \u201clost confidence\u201d in the directors of the retailer to protect the interests of investors other than Mike Ashley, the founder. The Financial Reporting Council, the City regulator, is understood to be looking into the agreement and why it was not disclosed in Sport Direct\u2019s annual report as a related party transaction. It has not yet launched a formal investigation, but could so if it finds evidence of wrongdoing. Listed companies in Britain are required to disclose deals with parties who are connected with the directors. Mike Ashley is the executive deputy chairman of Sport Direct and still owns 55% of the company. However, Sports Direct said in a statement that the company and its auditors Grant Thornton were \u201ccomfortable that there was no related party disclosure required in Sports Direct\u2019s historic accounts\u201d. The revelation of the arrangement with Ashley\u2019s brother is the latest tremor to hit Sports Direct. The company is facing a rebellion by shareholders at its annual meeting next month over the treatment of workers and its business practices, with many planning to vote against the reappointment of Keith Hellawell as chairman. Thousands of Sports Direct warehouse workers are set to receive back pay totalling about \u00a31m after a Guardian investigation revealed the company was effectively paying workers in its warehouse in Derbyshire below the minimum wage. Sports Direct says on its website that Barlin Delivery Limited may provide international delivery to online purchasers. Barlin was incorporated in February 2015 and is owned by John Ashley. Its registered address is a detached house in a cul-de-sac in the Lincolnshire seaside town of Cleethorpes. Barlin\u2019s terms and conditions say it uses DHL to deliver goods. Online orders from overseas customers make up about 6% of Sports Direct\u2019s \u00a32.9bn annual revenue and Barlin makes about \u00a3300,000 a year from the arrangement, the company told the Financial Times, which first reported Barlin\u2019s work for Sports Direct. This profit is twice the annual salary paid to Dave Forsey, the chief executive of Sports Direct. John Ashley worked alongside his brother at Sports Direct as head of IT until he left in 2014. Mike Ashley founded Sports Direct in 1982. The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, which represents pension funds with \u00a31tn of assets and shareholdings, warned the arrangement was \u201cyet another unseemly detail at a company where there are already serious concerns about corporate governance and oversight\u201d. Luke Hildyard, head of stewardship and corporate governance at the PLSA, added: \u201cSports Direct is an example of a case where shareholder pressure is needed on a range of significant issues.\u201d Mike Fox, head of sustainable investments at Royal London, which owns 0.18% of Sports Direct, said: \u201cWe have long-standing concerns about the governance of the company and have lost confidence in the ability of the non-executive directors to govern the company and protect the interests of minority shareholders.\u201d Accounting experts said that the existing concerns about Sports Direct mean it may have been prudent to publish the arrangement with John Ashley. Sarah Wilson, chief executive of Manifest, the shareholder advisory group, said: \u201cInvestors don\u2019t like surprises and so look for transparency and business models that are easy to understand. \u201cThe spirit of the law is as important as the letter. Unlike other retailers, Sports Direct\u2019s culture appears to be about minimum compliance \u2013 something we can see elsewhere in the annual report in relation to, for example, its strategic review where it publishes a laundry list of risk factors but says very little about how its management systems engage with its responsibilities.\u201d The address where Barlin Delivery is registered in Cleethorpes is one of the upmarket homes in Hewitts Manor, a 16-house estate sheltered from a busy main road by a six-foot privet hedge. The large detached brick building, dubbed Richmond House, boasts a mock Tudor frontage and a Victorian-style street lantern outside the front door, as well as a neatly kept front garden. Neighbours said that a woman named \u201cMaggie\u201d lived there but that they did not think John Ashley was living at the property. Ashley\u2019s co-director at Barlin is listed as a Margaret Brown. Sports Direct said the tie-up with Barlin allowed it to \u201cderisk\u201d its overseas delivery services. The company said: \u201cSports Direct took professional advice at the time (and subsequently) as to the most efficient way to structure its operations so that it could satisfy the following objectives \u2013maximise its internet sales, deliver value to its customers, de-risk the distribution logistics. \u201cThe result of this exercise was to set up a company outside the group in order to deliver some of the services required in the successful running of an internet operation. Barlin Delivery was the company chosen to carry out this role. Barlin arranges all international deliveries, including dealing with the courier companies, with undelivered packages and returns.\u201d",

For central bankers that means listening to erudite academic papers on quantitative easing and discussing Milton Friedman\u2019s theory of helicopter money. As far as the markets are concerned, though, only one thing matters at this year\u2019s meeting: whether Janet Yellen gives any clues as to the timing of the next increase in interest rates from the US Federal Reserve. Wall Street is agog for two reasons. Firstly the recent economic news from the world\u2019s biggest economy has been pretty good. Secondly Yellen\u2019s No 2 at the Fed, Stanley Fischer, made some hawkish comments at the weekend which left a clear impression that an increase in borrowing costs this year remained on the agenda. Predictably the idea that the Fed is contemplating a rate rise while all the other major central banks are looking to provide more stimulus led to a stronger US dollar and weaker commodity prices. But, as Wall Street should not need to be reminded, we have been here before. At the start of the year there was speculation that there would be four increases in interest rates during the course of 2016. So far there have been none. The Fed has given strong signals that interest rates are going up only to back away again in the face of downbeat economic data. Three possible dates have been pencilled in by the markets for a Fed move: September, December and March next year. September will be a non-starter unless Yellen comes up with some uncharacteristically tough and unequivocal words in Jackson Hole. She is is an instinctive dove, doesn\u2019t especially want to see the dollar appreciate rapidly is and politically smart to boot. A September rate rise would come smack in the middle of the presidential election race. It is more probable that the choice is between December and March. The recent data points to December. The Fed\u2019s recent actions point to March.",

Each year, the maestros of monetary policy show up in the <a href=\"http://www.jacksonhole.com/grand-teton-national-park.html\">Grand Tetons, Wyoming</a>, to show that they know how to have a good time. For central bankers that means listening to erudite academic papers on quantitative easing and discussing <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-03-22/friedman-s-money-dropping-helicopter-gains-speed\">Milton Friedman\u2019s theory of helicopter money</a>.</p> \n<p>As far as the markets are concerned, though, only one thing matters at this year\u2019s meeting: whether Janet Yellen gives any clues as to the timing of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/federal-reserve-wont-raise-interest-rates-economic-growth\">next increase in interest rates from the US Federal Reserve</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"94099e13-5f72-49c1-89e2-ae973723f751\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Explainer\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Wall Street is agog for two reasons. Firstly the recent economic news from the world\u2019s biggest economy has been pretty good. Secondly Yellen\u2019s No 2 at the Fed, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-21/fischer-signals-2016-rate-hike-with-economy-nearing-fed-goals\">Stanley Fischer, made some hawkish comments at the weekend</a> which left a clear impression that an increase in borrowing costs this year remained on the agenda.</p> \n<p>Predictably the idea that the Fed is contemplating a rate rise while all the other major central banks are looking to provide more stimulus led to a stronger US dollar and weaker commodity prices.</p> \n<p>But, as Wall Street should not need to be reminded, we have been here before. At the start of the year there was speculation that there would be four increases in interest rates during the course of 2016. So far there have been none. The Fed has given strong signals that interest rates are going up only to back away again in the face of downbeat economic data.</p> \n<p>Three possible dates have been pencilled in by the markets for a Fed move: September, December and March next year. September will be a non-starter unless Yellen comes up with some uncharacteristically tough and unequivocal words in Jackson Hole. She is is an instinctive dove, doesn\u2019t especially want to see the dollar appreciate rapidly is and politically smart to boot. A September rate rise would come smack in the middle of the presidential election race.</p> \n<p>It is more probable that the choice is between December and March. The recent data points to December. The Fed\u2019s recent actions point to March. <br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s most respected fund manager is to scrap bonuses at his firm, in a challenge to the conventional City wisdom that bonuses are essential to motivate staff. Neil Woodford is putting all staff at Oxford-based Woodford Investment Management on a flat salary this year. His move won support from another senior figure in the fund management world, Daniel Godfrey, who said his new venture will not pay bonuses. Fund management groups have until now been among the most aggressive payers of large bonuses, arguing that they are crucial for performance. In 2013 and 2014 M&amp;G paid about \u00a333m in total to just one fund manager, Richard Woolnough. One of Woolnough\u2019s funds, M&amp;G Optimal Income, is now languishing in the bottom half of the performance tables. Woodford dismisses bonuses as \u201clargely ineffective\u201d which can lead to \u201cwrong behaviours\u201d. Craig Newman, chief executive of Woodford Investment Management, said: \u201cWhile bonuses are an established feature of the financial sector, Neil and I wanted to take the opportunity to do something different that supports the firm\u2019s culture and ethos of challenging the status quo. \u201cWe concluded that bonuses are largely ineffective in influencing the right behaviours. \u201cThere is little correlation between bonus and performance and this is backed by widespread academic evidence. Many studies conclude that bonuses don\u2019t work as a motivator, as expectation is already built in. Behavioural studies also suggest that bonuses can lead to short-term decision making and wrong behaviours.\u201d To soften the blow of cutting bonuses and to make sure staff are not hit by an effective pay cut, Woodford has given them a pay rise for the current financial year. The firm said that by paying a single salary, it will improve employee behaviour and performance \u2013 arguing that bonuses are a distraction. Woodford\u2019s firm will be joined by Godfrey\u2019s new fund. Godfrey, the former boss of the Investment Association \u2013 which includes all the major City asset management groups \u2013 admitted that pay levels and bonuses in the industry are too high. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to demonise bonuses full stop, but there are areas of the economy where pay is objectively too high but when you are in an arms race it is hard to stop it. There are areas where pay should come down, but how you get there is another matter\u201d He wants fund manager groups to be more forthcoming in explaining pay levels, and in his own new venture will be paying just a basic salary and a very long-term shares package. Woodford has linked the change in pay structure to numerous academic studies which have indicated that bloated pay packets at big corporations and among fund managers do not result in better outcomes for investors or customers. Killing Conscience: the Unintended Behavioural Consequences of Pay for Performance by Lynn Stout, found that the more that chief executives get paid, the worse their companies perform over the next three years. Stout found that workplaces that rely on bonuses promote selfishness and opportunism, with the end result more uncooperative, unethical, and illegal employee behaviour. Traditionally, fund manager pay is linked to performance against a particular target or benchmark \u2013 such as beating the FTSE All Share index by 1% or 2%. But in another challenge to conventional wisdom, Woodford does not operate according to benchmarks, preferring to pick and hold stocks according to their fundamental value rather than their relative performance against a benchmark. Launched in May 2014, Woodford Investment Management has more than \u00a314bn assets under management. Its main fund returned 16% for investors in 2015, compared with 6% for the average fund, and over the past year it is up 8% compared with the industry average of 6%.",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has been thrown into another crisis after a dispute with a supplier forced it to halt production at six plants and cut the hours of nearly 28,000 workers. VW took the drastic action because a company that supplies it with gearbox parts and seat covers stopped deliveries. The move affects some of its biggest factories, which produce the popular Passat and Golf models as well as engines and exhausts. The German carmaker has halted manufacturing at its Wolfsburg and Emden plants for a week and is to reduce hours of staff elsewhere between now and 30 August. In total, 27,700 workers are affected, with some sent home and others moved to short-time working. VW has 10 factories in Germany in total. The German government has urged VW and the supplier Prevent to resolve the dispute. Analysts at UBS have warned that VW could take a \u20ac100m (\u00a386.1m) hit to its profits if car production is halted for a week at Wolfsburg, where the carmaker is based. The disruption to production comes almost a year after it emerged that VW had cheated diesel emissions tests in the US. The company is still trying to deal with the repercussions of the scandal, which has already costs it billions of euros. VW has agreed a settlement with US authorities that will see it pay up to $15bn (\u00a311.4bn). VW has initiated legal action against Prevent in an attempt to force the supplier to resume deliveries. However, Prevent is holding out. The dispute is connected to VW cancelling contracts with Prevent, which the supplier claims have cost it millions of euros. A Prevent spokesman told the German newspaper Handelsblatt that VW was imposing unacceptable conditions on its suppliers. In a statement, VW said although a district court had issued injunctions which obliged \u201cthe suppliers to resume deliveries, the suppliers have not as yet met their obligations. Volkswagen continues its efforts to reach agreement with the suppliers. \u201cGiven that further developments are not foreseeable, Volkswagen is making arrangements for various flexibilisation measures extending as far as short-time work.\u201d VW and Prevent had a \u201cserious responsibility\u201d to resolve the dispute, said a spokesman for the economy ministry. \u201cWe assume and also expect the companies to solve the sticking issues as soon as possible.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There\u2019s been a multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical deal, more fallout from the Brexit vote and markets are jittery ahead of a speech later in the week from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, on what was originally looking like a quiet summer Monday. On the Brexit front, financial firms believe the impact of the vote to leave the European Union has not so far been as stark as expected. But the UK housing market is likely to contract next year in the wake of the decision, said estate agents Countrywide. Meanwhile, markets are heading lower and the dollar is climbing again ahead of any interest rate comments from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday. Investors are uncertain about the prospect for rates, given that last week\u2019s dovish Fed minutes were followed by comments from Fed members including Stanley Fischer suggesting a rate rise could yet happen shortly. Oil has come under pressure as hopes fade that OPEC may come up with an agreement to support prices at its meeting next month. In a note today, Morgan Stanley suggested any deal was unlikely. The strength of the dollar is also having an impact on the crude price. And on the deal front, Pfizer is paying $14bn for cancer specialist Medivation. On the markets, the FTSE 100 is currently down 41 points or 0.6%, Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 0.79% and France\u2019s Cac is 0.4% lower. European markets have seen their declines accelerate as Wall Street opens. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 80 points in early trading. On that note, we\u2019ll close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. With all the speculation about when the US Federal Reserve may raise interest rates, here is a bit of better than expected economic news. The strength of the dollar - lifted by growing talk of a Federal Reserve rate rise before too long - has helped push down gold and silver prices. Gold has fallen from $1340 an ounce at the open to $1337 while silver has gone from $18.96 to $18.93. In turn this has left shares in precious metal miners Randgold Resources and Fresnillo lower, and helped push the FTSE 100 into negative territory. As reported earlier, Royal Bank of Scotland has started charging some corporate clients to hold their cash, but its chairman Howard Davis has just been questioning the current ultra low interest rate policies from central banks. Sean Farrell reports: As Royal Bank of Scotland started charging some clients to hold their cash, its chairman has questioned the effectiveness of ultra-low interest rates and called for a rethink of monetary policy . From Monday, RBS will charge interest to about 70 customers, such as banks and pension funds, on the cash they place with the state-controlled bank as collateral for trading complex financial products. It is the first time a bank has imposed charges for sterling holdings since the BoE halved interest rates to a new record low of 0.25% on 4 August and restarted its quantitative easing (QE) programme of government bond purchases. The BoE relaxed monetary policy in an effort to support the economy following the vote to leave the EU by discouraging banks from hoarding cash. RBS\u2019s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said that as interest rates get closer to zero the central bank loses control of the effects of monetary policy and leaves itself few options for action iin a recession. Davies told Bloomberg TV: \u201cWhen you reach the lower band you don\u2019t know how the economy will respond \u2026 We don\u2019t really know what impact QE on the scale it is being implemented is having. I really do think we are entering a period where some of the previous certainties are no longer quite so certain and you really need to rethink the monetary policy framework.\u201d The full story is here: Back with oil, and Morgan Stanley does not expect any major decisions from next month\u2019s OPEC meeting, despite the market\u2019s earlier optimism that an agreement to support crude prices could emerge. In a new note, the bank\u2019s commodity strategist Adam Longson said: We continue to view a meaningful OPEC production agreement as highly unlikely, but we would not be dismissive of the short term price impact of an OPEC meeting. Comments about intervention alone can scare off shorts. However, we see too many headwinds and logistical challenges to a meaningful deal given past statements by OPEC and its members regarding the positive state of markets, domestic output goals and objections from members producing below potential. In fact, the market has misinterpreted some recent comments from Saudi Arabia, in our view, without seeing the full quote or context. He continued: Oil Minister Al-Falih has said \u201cWe are, in Saudi Arabia, watching the market closely, and if there is a need to take any action to help the market rebalance, then we would, of course in cooperation with OPEC and major non- OPEC exporters.\u201d This is the same talking point the kingdom has been using for some time. It neither acknowledges the need for action, nor firmly commits Saudi Arabia to participate if certain parameters are met. We agree with Rapidan Group that it is unlikely Riyadh will take any freeze negotiation seriously as officials believe the market share policy is slowly but surely working. Few OPEC members have expressed a need for a freeze, with the exception of Venezuela. Members with production outages have been less supportive of a production freeze this time as well, with Nigeria now joining the dissent. Pfizer has confirmed earlier reports and announced the $14bn takeover of cancer specialist Medivation. Pfizer boss Ian Read said: The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer. The addition of Medivation will strengthen Pfizer\u2019s Innovative Health business and accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key focus areas, which we believe will drive greater growth and scale of that business over the long-term. This transaction is another example of how we are effectively deploying our capital to generate attractive returns and create shareholder value. This is the latest deal from the acquisitive Pfizer. In April it scrapped plans to merge with Ireland\u2019s Allergan and in 2014 a proposal to buy AstraZeneca for more than \u00a369bn collapsed. But it has since completed the smaller takeovers of Anacor and Hospira. With trading light, we are seeing some bumpy movements in stock markets, which have now lost their earlier gains. The FTSE 100 is now down 40 points or 0.5%, Germany\u2019s Dax has fallen 0.28% and France\u2019s Cac is 0.17% lower. And here\u2019s a reminder of where various US Federal Reserve members stand on policy: Back to the gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole later this week, and Barclays believes US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen could hint at a September rate rise: Despite the dip in the oil price, stock markets have recovered from their early losses. With the FTSE 100 holding firm at around 6 points higher, Germany\u2019s Dax is now up 0.8% while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.7% and the Stoxx Europe 600 is up 0.7%. Swiss pesticides and seeds group Syngenta is among the main risers, up 12% to a 14 month high after US regulators cleared its $44bn takeover by ChemChina. Here\u2019s an interesting table from money transfer specialists HiFX, showing how sterling has fallen since the Brexit vote against a range of currencies. The pound has been under pressure everywhere, but the smallest declines - relatively - have come against the Swedish and Turkish currencies: Andy Scott, economist, HiFX sais: Since the UK voted to leave the EU we have seen the ramifications unfold. Sterling has dropped against most of the world\u2019s currencies and fell further by 1% cent against the Dollar and the Euro following the Bank of England\u2019s recent decision to cut interest rates. However, it is important to note that while sterling trades on the back foot due to the Brexit uncertainty, we are starting to see signs of sterling regain its footing and some lost territory. Its journey back to the levels of the evening of June 23rd is still distant; however it looks like we have already seen the \u2018Brexit Bottom for Sterling\u2019. In an unusual move, City fund manager Neil Woodford has abolished all staff bonuses at his investment firm. The Times reports: One of the most prominent figures in the City has taken the unprecedented step of permanently abolishing all staff bonuses at his firm. Neil Woodford, the star stock-picker and founder of Woodford Investment Management, has rejected the conventional wisdom that bonuses are essential to motivate and retain staff and has put everyone on a flat salary. The new pay scheme was quietly introduced on April 1 for the firm\u2019s 35 staff, who include sales people, traders, fund managers and analysts as well as IT, marketing and compliance professionals. The full story is here (\u00a3). Sports Direct is never far from the headlines these days, and once again, Mike Ashley has not disappointed. Sean Farrell reports: Sports Direct pays a company owned by the older brother of the retailer\u2019s founder and majority owner Mike Ashley to deliver goods purchased online to customers outside the UK. Britain\u2019s biggest sportswear chain has not disclosed the arrangement with Barlin Delivery Limited in its annual accounts. Barlin, which was incorporated in February 2015, is owned by John Ashley. Its registered address is a detached house in a cul-de-sac in the Lincolnshire seaside town of Cleethorpes. Sports Direct\u2019s website says it only delivers to the UK but that Barlin may provide international delivery to online purchasers. Barlin\u2019s terms and conditions say it uses DHL to deliver goods. The full story is here: Another big pharmaceutical takeover could be on the cards. There are reports that Pfizer is about to pay $14bn to buy California biotechnology company Medivation, a specialist in cancer treatments. Pfizer is said to have beaten a number of rivals to the deal, including France\u2019s Sanofi. German chancellor Angela Merkel is due to meet Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi and French president Francois Hollande for another discussion on Europe\u2019s future following the Brexit vote. The gathering comes three weeks before an informal EU summit in Bratislava, the first without the UK taking part. After an initial dip the FTSE 100 has edged into positive territory, up around 5 points in thin trading. But Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped 0.17% while France\u2019s Cac is 0.1% lower. Against the dollar, the pound is down 0.16% at $1.3059 while it has adde 0.28% against the euro to \u20ac1.1573. Today sees some large corporate clients of Royal Bank of Scotland facing charges for holding deposits with the lender, as it becomes the first to charge negative interest rates. Jill Treanor reported the details: Royal Bank of Scotland is to start charging major financial institutions for any cash it holds on their behalf for trading purposes, in the latest illustration of the impact of Mark Carney\u2019s post-Brexit vote stimulus package. It is the first time a bank has started to make charges for sterling deposits since the governor of the Bank of England announced on 4 August that interest rates would be cut from 0.5% to 0.25% to stave off any economic downturn following the vote to leave the EU. Carney said he was not a fan of negative rates. Even so, from Monday, about 70 RBS customers will start to receive negative rates because they will charged for any cash they place as collateral for trading in complex financial products, such as futures or options. The move will not affect the small business customers whom the bank, and its NatWest arm, warned last month it may have to charge for making deposits. Back with Brexit, and the government could come under pressure to move ahead with new road, rail and other building projects after a sharp drop in infrastructure spending since the vote. According to consultancy Barbour ABI, the value of contracts dropped 20% in July from the previous month, to \u00a31.5bn. The details are here\u201d One of the major events of the week is the annual Jackson Hole symposium, mainly because US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is due to speak on Friday. Her comments will be scoured for further clues as to when the Fed might raise interest rates, given that last week saw a dovish set of Fed minutes immediately followed by comments from a number of Fed members tacking a different tack. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: This week the focus is likely to be on central banks once more with the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday, and recent comments from Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda suggesting that he could push interest rates in Japan even more negative, while Fed vice Chair Stanley Fischer tried to buoy up expectations of some Fed action this year by saying that the US central bank was within striking distance of its inflation target... While no one seriously expects the Federal Reserve to act on rates next month, some Fed officials seem extremely keen to try and keep the option on the table, with both the New York and California Fed President\u2019s Dudley and Williams the most vocal, along with Fischer\u2019s comments at the weekend. Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s predecessor, Ben Bernanke was quite fond of signalling some significant policy moves in the wake of the financial crisis at this very event [Jackson Hole], so much so that it has become a leading indicator for Fed and central bank policy in the last few years. In this context attention will be on Ms Yellen\u2019s speech on Friday, however it doesn\u2019t seem likely that we\u2019ll get any significant clues despite the markets desire to be hand held by the Fed. The oil price has been supported in recent days by hopes that producers will agree measures to tackle oversupply when they meet next month. But some of that optimism has now waned, not helped by news that Chinese exports of diesel and gasoline soared in July. That follows another rise in the weekly US rig count on Friday, and comments over the weekend from Iraq that its oil exports will increase by 5% shortly as production from the Kirkuk fields restarts. So crude has fallen back below $50 a barrel, with Brent currently down 1.85% at $49.94. With no major economic data due and a mixed performance in Asia, European markets are expected to open marginally lower for the most part: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The shock outcome to the UK referendum has left investors, politicians and the general public in a state of heightened uncertainty about the future. Nowhere is this more evident than in two new surveys, with accountancy firm EY saying that the City is less gloomy about the Brexit vote than expected, but a warning from estate agency Countrywide that the housing market will be hit by vote and will not recover until 2018. EY tracked public statements from 232 banks, insurers, private equity and other financial firms and concluded that only one fifth believed the vote would have negative implications for their business. EY said: The immediate impact of the referendum has not been as stark as many initially feared. But the firms were concerned about passporting rights - the laws giving financial companies the right to operate across the 28 EU states - whose future is unclear. Meanwhile Countrywide said house price growth would slow to 2.5% this year, contract by 1% in 2017 before recovering to 2% in 2018. It said: Our central view is that the economy will avoid a hard landing, which is good news for housing markets. However, the weaker prospects for confidence, household incomes and the labour market mean that we do expect some modest falls in house prices before they return to positive growth towards the end of 2017 and into 2018. Our economics editor Larry Elliott has also been looking at the implications of Brexit, and says the doom and gloom and predictions of economic armageddon have been overdone: And there is of course no clear idea yet when Brexit will ever happen, given the uncertainty about when Article 50 - the start of the exit process - will be triggered. Jon Henley has been looking at the process of leaving the EU, and concludes it will not happen in the immediate future, given that civil servants charged with the task do not yet have an office and hold meetings in Starbucks:",

      "bodyText": "Passengers of easyJet and British Airways, and the UK\u2019s biggest package holiday operators, could be charged \u00a325 if they make a complaint about delays, cancellations or lost baggage that is subsequently not upheld. The airlines, plus Thomson and Thomas Cook, have joined a dispute resolution service for tricky complaints that cannot be resolved by the companies themselves. But passengers who use this must pay if their case is unsuccessful. Previously, the Civil Aviation Authority ran a free mediation service between travellers and airlines for passengers who were not satisfied with the resolution provided by the company. But under new aviation rules, airlines and package holiday providers have voluntarily agreed to be registered with the external Alternative Dispute Resolution scheme (ADR). Ryanair and Flybe have joined the retail ombudsman, which does not impose fees, but British Airways, easyJet, Thomson and Thomas Cook have registered with the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR), which levies the \u00a325 charge on unsuccessful cases. The charge comes amid widespread anger at the chaotic approach by some airlines to processing compensation claims for delays and cancellations. Under EU rules, airlines are liable to pay between \u20ac250 and \u20ac600 (\u00a3216-\u00a3517) for delays of three to four hours or more. However, in recent months, easyJet has been accused of holding back payments months after claims have been made. According to research by consumer body Which?, nearly one-quarter of flights departing or arriving in the UK were delayed by 15 minutes or more over the past year, with 10,000 held up by more than three hours. Which? named Vueling as the worst for short-haul delays. A spokesman for CEDR said: \u201cThe \u00a325 fee is payable if there is no merit in the claim. But if the passenger\u2019s claim is found to have any merit at all, then they are entitled to 100% of the compensation due.\u201d Travellers are not required to use an ADR. Many instead opt to go through the small claims court, or use lawyers specialising in claims against airlines, although law firms often take one-third of any compensation awarded. Which? described the new system for resolving complaints as \u201chopelessly muddled\u201d and said there should be a single aviation ombudsman. Currently, 20 airlines are registered with an ADR, with three different schemes currently used: the retail ombudsman, CEDR and s\u00f6p.",

      "bodyText": "As Royal Bank of Scotland started charging some clients to hold their cash, its chairman has questioned the effectiveness of ultra-low interest rates and called for a rethink of monetary policy . From Monday, RBS will charge interest to about 70 customers, such as banks and pension funds, on the cash they place with the state-controlled bank as collateral for trading complex financial products. It is the first time a bank has imposed charges for sterling holdings since the BoE halved interest rates to a new record low of 0.25% on 4 August and restarted its quantitative easing (QE) programme of government bond purchases. The BoE relaxed monetary policy in an effort to support the economy following the vote to leave the EU by discouraging banks from hoarding cash. RBS\u2019s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said that as interest rates get closer to zero the central bank loses control of the effects of monetary policy and leaves itself few options for action iin a recession. Davies told Bloomberg TV: \u201cWhen you reach the lower band you don\u2019t know how the economy will respond \u2026 We don\u2019t really know what impact QE on the scale it is being implemented is having. I really do think we are entering a period where some of the previous certainties are no longer quite so certain and you really need to rethink the monetary policy framework.\u201d Davies said he agreed with John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, who said last week central banks should consider adopting a higher inflation target more suited to lower growth. \u201cI\u2019m in favour of trying to lift over time the level of inflation we target,\u201d Davies said. The BoE aims to keep inflation rising at a rate of 2%, a target it is likely to exceed as the falling pound pushes up prices even as the economy slows. Global interest rates are very low and are negative in the eurozone and other jurisdictions as central banks seek to discourage companies and banks from hoarding cash by charging banks to park money with the central bank. The BoE\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, has said he is not a fan of negative interest rates and most economists expect the BoE to cut rates no lower than 0.1%. RBS, which is 73% owned by the taxpayer, has limited its negative interest rates to deposits required of financial companies to carry out futures trades. RBS said only one of the clients in question was a non-financial company. Small firms and other larger companies are unaffected but RBS warned its 850,000 business customers last month that it may have to charge them for deposits given persistently low interest rates. Davies said the letter to business customers was a \u201cbureaucratic exercise\u201d that was misunderstood and that charging financial institutions put RBS in line with some other banks. \u201cYou have to protect yourself against a position where you have a large inflow of cash and you are not charging anything and you have to put it with a central bank that is charging you.\u201d Negative rates can have unforeseen effects such as pumping up asset prices and putting bank profits under strain. Critics have argued that loose monetary policy is ineffective on its own and that government needs to step in by spending on infrastructure projects. There is no indication that any high street bank is considering charging retail customers for putting money on deposit. Such a move would be deeply unpopular with savers, who have paid the price for ultra-low interest rates since the BoE cut borrowing costs following the financial crisis. Santander, whose 123 account had paid 3% on sums up to \u00a320,000, halved the rate last week, blaming the prospect of prolonged low interest rates and increased costs for the banking industry. Other banks are paying little or nothing on savings with instant access or short notice periods. Barclays cut its \u201ceveryday saver\u201d rate on Friday to 0.05% from 0.25%, joining other banks \u2013 such as HSBC\u2019s First Direct \u2013 in imposing large cuts to savings rates.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct pays a company owned by the brother of the retailer\u2019s majority owner, Mike Ashley, to deliver online purchases to customers outside the UK. Britain\u2019s biggest sportswear chain has not disclosed the arrangement with Barlin Delivery Limited in its annual accounts. Barlin, which was incorporated in February 2015, is owned by John Ashley. Its registered address is a detached house in a cul-de-sac in the Lincolnshire seaside town of Cleethorpes. Sports Direct\u2019s website says it only delivers to the UK but that Barlin may provide international delivery to online purchasers. Barlin\u2019s terms and conditions say it uses DHL to deliver goods. Online orders from overseas customers make up about 6% of Sports Direct\u2019s \u00a32.9bn annual revenue and Barlin makes about \u00a3300,000 a year from the arrangement, the company told the Financial Times, which reported Barlin\u2019s work for Sports Direct (\u00a3). Sports Direct told the FT its auditors, Grant Thornton, had decided the company did not need to disclose its arrangement with Barlin despite the business being owned by the brother of its founder and executive deputy chairman. John Ashley, a computer science graduate, built Sports Direct\u2019s IT systems from scratch after joining his brother\u2019s business in 1989. With the company\u2019s annual general meeting coming up on 7 September, the contract with Barlin may add to shareholder unease about how Ashley runs Sports Direct. Ashley has put his daughter\u2019s boyfriend in charge of the firm\u2019s property team despite his lack of experience in commercial property. Sports Direct chose to have an outside company manage its overseas orders because of the complexity and certain risks involved, the company told the FT. Barlin provided \u201cvaluable arms-length services\u201d and the arrangement added to Sports Direct\u2019s revenues rather than diverting them, it said. Sports Direct is facing a potential investor revolt at the AGM after the Guardian revealed poor working conditions at its Shirebrook warehouse, which MPs compared to those at a Victorian workhouse. Ashley has conducted a review of how the company treats its staff but a trade union resolution calling for an independent inquiry is likely to garner substantial shareholder support.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In the past the unemployment rate was a pretty good measure of the health of the economy. The current rate of 5.7% for much of the past 30 years would have meant the economy was in quite robust health. But over the past decade, the increasing growth of part-time employment means that the gauging the economy\u2019s fitness requires much more than just taking the unemployment pulse rate. Last week the Australian Bureau of Statistics announced that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.7% in seasonally adjusted terms. While that big number is always the first thing reported from the labour force figures, for me looking at the actual employment growth is a better indicator of what is going on in the economy. But even here we need to look at what type of employment is growing \u2013 rather than just the big overall number. The monthly employment growth paints a less rosy picture than the 5.7% unemployment rate would suggest. After five months of full-time employment falling, in trend terms the growth of 1,239 people employed full-time saw a 0.02%increase. The big growth was all in part-time employment \u2013 up 10,576 jobs or 0.3%. And yet even this showed a falling off of growth from earlier in the year: It also saw a mere 0.06% increase in the amount of hours worked in July. Hours worked is in many ways the best measure of employment health. Part-time employment can mean anything from one hour a week to 34 hours, and equally full-time employment includes anything from 35 hours and above. Hours worked not only can shows the shift from full-time to part-time it can also detect changes within each category. There is also a strong link between employment growth and the growth in hours worked. At the moment the growth of hours worked is sagging below that of employment. This isn\u2019t too bad if it means employers are either just temporarily reducing hours, or still hiring workers, but just for part-time until things improve. The worry is that the slowing hours worked growth is predicting future slowing employment growth: But the big story of employment at the moment is part-time employment growth and it is not just about that versus full-time work; it is involves gender and age. For most of 2014 and 2015 male full-time employment growth was quite lacklustre while full-time employment growth for women was pretty solid. But this year, full-time jobs have been hard to find for both genders: While part-time workers are likely to be women (there are currently 2.6m women working part-time compared to 1.2m men) the big growth in part-time employment in the past few years has been for men. In the past five years the number of men employed part-time has increased by 21.5% compared to an increase of just 1.9% for full-time work. The shift of men towards part-time work is one which has been happening now for a quarter of a century. In 1990, 80% of men in the prime working age range of 25 to 64 years were working full-time. Just 3.8% of prime aged men were working part-time. Now only 72.4% of prime aged men work full-time, while 10% are working part-time. There are now fewer men in their prime working age working full-time than ever before. Conversely, there are now more prime-aged women working full-time than ever, and the peak has been steady now for nearly five years: In effect, the story since the GFC has been of male full-time employment shrinking, while part-time work has grown. But for women, part-time work has grown while full-time employment has remained steady. Men working full-time still dominate the labour market. Of all employment, full-time men accounts for 43% alone, but since 2012 there are more women employed in total than there are men in full-time work \u2013 something unthinkable 25 years ago: But the rise and fall in part-time employment is also about age. Over the past decade the main growth in employment numbers is full-time employment of prime aged workers \u2013 not surprisingly given they are the biggest section of the population. But in the past year there has been a greater increase in actual part-time employment for 25-64 years olds than for full-time, and the same scenario is reflected for youth and for worked over 65 years of age. But when we look at the increase in employed workers as a percentage of the people in each age group the rise in part-time employment becomes obvious: In the past decade, the percentage of youth working part-time has increased from 28.8% of people aged 15-24 to 31.6%. In the same time the percentage of youth working full-time has fallen from 35.4% to just 27.2%. But while full-time work has evaporated for the youth, older workers have been staying in the workforce in much greater numbers \u2013 both in full-time and very much so in part-time. At the start of this century just 3% of those over 65 were working part-time, but now 7.3% of those supposedly in the retirement age are working part-time: Now part-time work often gets a bad rap, when in reality it is not always bad \u2013 it can be a first start for many workers and can be necessary when raising a child. For those over the age of 65 the reasons for work are less obvious \u2013 either out of need, or because better health allows more people to stay working. Certainly since 2004 there has been a steady increase in the numbers of older workers. But with the increase in part-time employment across the board has also come an increase in underemployment: The underemployment rate across all age groups is much higher now than it was in 2003 when the unemployment rate was much the same as it is now. The shift towards part-time employment over the past decade means more than in the past we need to look at much more than just the unemployment rate to gauge the health of the labour market. At the moment while the unemployment rate remains well below 6%, the weakness in the growth of full-time employment and hours worked suggests the labour market is a long way from peak fitness.",
