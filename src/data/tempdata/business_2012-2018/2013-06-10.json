      "bodyText": "Over the past month or so, the City has woken up to the idea that 11 countries in the European Union are planning to introduce a Financial Transaction Tax. The big banks never really thought an idea originally dreamt up by James Tobin in the early 1970s would come to anything, but are now lobbying like crazy against a 0.1% levy on trading shares and bonds and a 0.01% tax on derivatives. On the face of it, the campaign is succeeding. There have been reports out of Brussels that the FTT will be delayed, watered down to the point of irrelevance, or scrapped altogether. Yet Europe's tax commissioner, Algirdas Semeta, made it clear at the weekend that there had been no changes as yet to the plans for the FTT and that the financial sector - \"probably the most powerful lobby in the world\" - should expect to pay its share. Semeta seems unimpressed by the argument that an FTT will turn Europe's financial districts into the modern-day equivalent of the dust bowls of the 1930s, hardly surprisingly given that seven out of the 20 biggest stock markets in the world - including London - already have FTTs. Nor does he seem that moved by the crocodile tears shed by the City for pensioners allegedly facing impoverishment from the Tobin tax, given the ruthless way in which the financial sector has gouged its customers with management charges far higher than the proposed rates for the FTT. Reports of the death of the FTT look exaggerated. Some form of the tax is going to be introduced after the German elections in September, not least because the opposition SDP will probably make it a condition of a coalition agreement with Angela Merkel's CDU. The City is engaged in a damage limitation exercise, but should count itself lucky. Other sectors of the economy - arguably more useful ones - pay VAT at 20%.",

      "body": "<p>Over the past month or so, the City has woken up to the idea that 11 countries in the European Union are planning to introduce a Financial Transaction Tax. The big banks never really thought an idea originally dreamt up by James Tobin in the early 1970s would come to anything, but are now lobbying like crazy against a 0.1% levy on trading shares and bonds and a 0.01% tax on derivatives.</p> <p>On the face of it, the campaign is succeeding. There have been reports out of Brussels that the FTT will be delayed, watered down to the point of irrelevance, or scrapped altogether. Yet Europe's tax commissioner, Algirdas Semeta, made it clear at the weekend that there had been no changes as yet to the plans for the FTT and that the financial sector - \"probably the most powerful lobby in the world\" - should expect to pay its share.</p> <p>Semeta seems unimpressed by the argument that an FTT will turn Europe's financial districts into the modern-day equivalent of the dust bowls of the 1930s, hardly surprisingly given that seven out of the 20 biggest stock markets in the world - including London - already have FTTs. Nor does he seem that moved by the crocodile tears shed by the City for pensioners allegedly facing impoverishment from the Tobin tax, given the ruthless way in which the financial sector has gouged its customers with management charges far higher than the proposed rates for the FTT.</p> <p>Reports of the death of the FTT look exaggerated. Some form of the tax is going to be introduced after the German elections in September, not least because the opposition SDP will probably make it a condition of a coalition agreement with Angela Merkel's CDU. The City is engaged in a damage limitation exercise, but should count itself lucky. Other sectors of the economy - arguably more useful ones - pay VAT at 20%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Greece's problem-plagued privatisation programme, which is key to the country's economic recovery and meeting its bailout targets, has received yet another blow with the failure of the planned sale of a state-owned natural gas supplier. Officials were stunned when the Russian energy giant Gazprom failed to bid for Depa, described as one of the jewels in the crown of a privatisation process that is due to raise \u20ac2.6bn this year. \"We had absolutely no inkling that this would happen,\" said one insider with close links to Taiped, Greece's privatization fund. \"Alexey Miller [Gazprom's CEO] himself was overseeing negotiations. It's a complete bolt out of the blue.\" The failure to secure binding bids for Depa before Monday's deadline marks a potentially huge setback for a country that has been forced to repeatedly scale back its privatisation programme because of a lack of headway. A selloff of state assets is one of the conditions attached to a \u20ac240bn bailout programme drawn up by the troika of the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union. From its initial aim to raise \u20ac50bn euro by 2019, Athens now says it wants to raise \u20ac11.1bn by 2016 and \u20ac25bn by 2020. A goal of \u20ac2.6bn had been set for 2013 but the lack of bids for Depa signals that even that modest target might be unachievable. Gazprom's Miller, a close friend of the Russian president, Vladmir Putin, had flown to Athens to conduct talks with the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras. Keen to secure a deal with the only international energy company that had shown any interest in Depa, the coalition government had extended the bid deadline and modified some of the terms \u2013 starting with lowering the amount the buyer would have to deposit as a guarantee \u2013 to facilitate the Russian takeover.

There also fears that failure to sell Depa could stymie the planned disposal of the state oil refiner, Hellenic Petroleum, which owns 35% of the natural gas company. Privatisations of ailing state companies are seen as crucial to revitalising an economy whose debt load is projected to hit 185% of GDP by the end of the year, despite two troika bailouts, and to lowering an unemployment rate that is now the highest in the eurozone at 27%.

Better to be pragmatic. Here's why:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Reason number one is that ploughing on with privatisation at the current juncture would be a fire sale. Greece would get less, probably much less, than the assets are worth.</p> <p>Reason number two is that Greece is actually over-achieving on deficit reduction this year, albeit at a terrible cost to the economy. Greece's primary budget deficit \u2013 which excludes debt interest payments \u2013 was just under \u20ac1bn in the first five months of 2013, well below the \u20ac4.2bn target. But that has only been achieved by slashing public spending and capital investment, contributing to an expected 4.6% decline in national output this year. Greece needs additional fiscal pain like a hole in the head.</p> <p>Reason number three is that there will be plenty of people in Brussels and Washington who will be privately glad, on geo-political grounds, that Gazprom is not buying DEPA. Last week, the IMF admitted it had made mistakes in its handling of Greece. This is the time to cut a bit of slack, not to compound past errors.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>More here: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics-blog/2013/jun/10/greece-natural-gas-privatisation-failure\">Greece's natural gas privatisation failure leaves programme in tatters</a></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51b5f0c9e4b0cc64243723a7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-10T15:29:15.855Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European Central Bank is reportedly thinking of extending the period during which Spain can draw on a \u20ac100bn bailout fund for its banks amid concerns that they may need a second round of aid from European partners.</p> <p>From Madrid, <strong>Giles Tremlett</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&#xa0;El Pa\u00eds newspaper reports that sources at the ECB and other European institutions have confirmed that discussions are under way about extending the fund's availability to Spain beyond the end of this year.&#xa0;</p> <p>So far Spain has requested \u20ac41bn from the \u20ac100bn available, but there are concerns that stricter provisioning and a worsening of loan performance as the economy continues to shrink will force it to seek more.</p> <p>Government sources in Madrid say they will not need to ask for more.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51b5efa2e4b0cc64243723a5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-10T15:24:21.258Z\">4.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4cb6f12a-84ff-4a91-bb9b-72cc0649a2e8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/10/1370877049464/c28ded45-7258-4d4d-adb9-45bfda00f2af-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Greek investigative journalist Costas Vaxevanis (C), who was acquitted last year over the publication of leaked Swiss bank account data, speaks to the media outside a court in Athens on June 10, 2013, as part of his second trial on the same charge, which was postponed today to October 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek investigative journalist Costas Vaxevanis speaking to the media this morning.

      "bodyText": "Greece's failure to sell Depa, its state-owned natural gas supplier, is a potentially huge setback for a country that has been forced to repeatedly scale back its privatisation programme. As our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, explains the lack of bids means that Greece's modest target of raising just \u20ac2.6bn in asset sales this year may be unachievable. Helena's story on the situation is now online here: Greek gas supplier selloff fails to draw Gazprom bid Here's a flavour: Gazprom was said last month to have made a preliminary bid of \u20ac900m for the company. The Greek joint venture M&amp;M, the Russian giant's only rival, had reportedly offered \u20ac550m. There was speculation on Monday that Moscow's decision to pull out had been dictated by geopolitical pressure. The United States and the EU have both made clear their distaste for Russia further increasing its influence over the European energy market. Brussels has openly grumbled about Moscow's business practices. \"I think the message the Russians got, especially from the European commission, was that the deal was not going to be approved,\" said Thanos Dokos who heads Greece's leading thinktank Eliamep. \"In those circumstances they felt, 'why bother?'\". There also fears that failure to sell Depa could stymie the planned disposal of the state oil refiner, Hellenic Petroleum, which owns 35% of the natural gas company. That's a good moment to wrap up for the day. In terms of a summary \u2022 Coverage of the Depa privatisation failure begins at 12.19pm. \u2022 Larry Elliott's analysis is here: 4.44pm In other news... \u2022 Analysts have challenged Francois Hollande's claim that the eurozone crisis is over (see 9.01am) \u2022 The Japanese Nikkei surged by almost 5% on optimism that its economic stimulus plan might work, and specuation that the US Federal Reserve won't stop its stimulus package (see 8.27am). \u2022 Italy's recession is worse than feared, with GDP now thought to have fallen by 0.6% in the first quarter (see 10.42am). \u2022 Standard &amp; Poor's raised the US credit rating outlook to stable, from negative (see 2.03pm).... and upgraded Latvia by one notch (see 3.03pm). I'll be back tomorrow, when the German constitutional court will begin its assessment of the European Central Bank's bond-buying programme (see 4.08pm). Until then, thanks, and goodnight. GW Mario Draghi has just pledged not to inflate Europe's debt crisis, in an interview with Germany's ZDF TV. Speaking a day before the German constitutional court holds a hearing into his OMT programme (see 4.08pm), the ECB president tried to calm German fears over his plans, vowing that the ECB would not throw a lifeline to a country that was insolvent. Fabrizio Goria of Linkiesta tweets the key quotes: A pretty uneventful day in the financial markets has ended with the UK, French, Spanish and Italian share indices all losing ground: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said it had been a \"rather mixed and lethargic session in Europe\", adding: Mixed signals from Asia aren\u2019t helping sentiment as concerns about Chinese growth don\u2019t appear to be being outweighed by this morning\u2019s much better than expected GDP number from Japan, which saw the NIKKEI post one of its biggest ever one day rebounds in years. Concerns about a slowdown in Chinese growth have hit mining stocks, sending the sector to three year lows with Polymetal, Vedanta Resources and Anglo American leading the decliners. And Brenda Kelly of IG said that fears over China (following weak data over ther weekend), meant the FTSE 100 didn't rally on the back of S&amp;P upgrading the US credit rating outlook. She also wasn't convinced by Hollande's claim that the eurozone crisis was over: Further confirmation that Italy remains mired in recession came today in the form of a year-on-year drop of 4.6% in industrial production for the country. Such a statement may be premature. The collapse of the privatisation of the DEPA gas company threatens to leave Greece's privatisation programme in tatters, our economics editor Larry Elliott warns tonight. With plans to sell Hellenic Petroleum also looking shaky (see 3.29pm), Greece looks rather unlikely to hit its target of \u20ac2.6bn (\u00a32.2bn) of asset sales in 2013 this year. The Troika could demand fresh cutbacks to close the gap.... but Larry argues that this would be a bad idea. Better to be pragmatic. Here's why: Reason number one is that ploughing on with privatisation at the current juncture would be a fire sale. Greece would get less, probably much less, than the assets are worth. Reason number two is that Greece is actually over-achieving on deficit reduction this year, albeit at a terrible cost to the economy. Greece's primary budget deficit \u2013 which excludes debt interest payments \u2013 was just under \u20ac1bn in the first five months of 2013, well below the \u20ac4.2bn target. But that has only been achieved by slashing public spending and capital investment, contributing to an expected 4.6% decline in national output this year. Greece needs additional fiscal pain like a hole in the head. Reason number three is that there will be plenty of people in Brussels and Washington who will be privately glad, on geo-political grounds, that Gazprom is not buying DEPA. Last week, the IMF admitted it had made mistakes in its handling of Greece. This is the time to cut a bit of slack, not to compound past errors. More here: Greece's natural gas privatisation failure leaves programme in tatters The European Central Bank is reportedly thinking of extending the period during which Spain can draw on a \u20ac100bn bailout fund for its banks amid concerns that they may need a second round of aid from European partners. From Madrid, Giles Tremlett explains: El Pa\u00eds newspaper reports that sources at the ECB and other European institutions have confirmed that discussions are under way about extending the fund's availability to Spain beyond the end of this year. So far Spain has requested \u20ac41bn from the \u20ac100bn available, but there are concerns that stricter provisioning and a worsening of loan performance as the economy continues to shrink will force it to seek more. Government sources in Madrid say they will not need to ask for more. Speaking of courts, and Greece, the investigative journalist who published the Lagarde List of suspected tax evaders had his case postponed again today. Costas Vaxevanis appeared in an Athens court this morning to face charges of breaching privacy laws. But after much to-ing and fro-ing he was told that court will not consider the case until October. Vaxevanis told our own Helena Smith: I sat in the dock with the three-member panel of judges going in and out of the room for more than two hours before it was decided that the trial should be postponed. Helena's story is online here. Theodora Oikonomides, who blogs/tweets as Irate Greek, also covered the trial this morning and was shocked by the way Vaxevanis was treated. Writing on radiobubble, she reports that two of his lawyers failed to show up at the trail, and that several key defense witnesses were also missing. Tension rose as the judges and prosecutor insisted to begin the trial on the spot, even if it meant postponing it once the only available witness had been heard. The prosecutor rejected the request for postponement twice, until V. Kapernaros [Vanevanis's lawyer] demanded that she state clearly the rationale for her rejection and that it be recorded in the trial minutes. Europe\u2019s most powerful central bankers will clash in Germany tomorrow when the country\u2019s supreme court scrutinises the legality of the European Central Bank's Outright Monetary Transactions programme. OMT is the brainchild of Mario Draghi, ECB president, whose pledge to buy unlimited debt from eurozone countries who agreed to strict conditions has helped to stabilise the eurozone. Excitingly, the case sees the Bundesbank go toe-to-toe against the ECB -- and analysts believe the case could potentially inflame the eurozone crisis (just as Francois Hollande claims it has ended). Our Europe editor Ian Traynor explains: The court case at Germany\u2019s Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe pits Germany\u2019s powerful Bundesbank against the ECB over whether Draghi\u2019s promise last year of unlimited intervention in the financial markets to save the euro was legal. Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank, is to argue strongly that Draghi\u2019s move was illegal as it is tantamount to the direct financing of governments, proscribed under the ECB\u2019s statutes. J\u00f6rg Asmussen, the German on the ECB board who used to work closely with Weidmann in the Merkel coalition in Berlin, will present the case for Draghi, contending that the policy was necessary to guarantee the euro\u2019s stability and thus fulfil the ECB\u2019s primary obligation, ensuring monetary stability in the eurozone. The Open Europe think tank has produced a research paper on the case -- The German Constitutional Court \u2013 a growing battleground in the eurozone crisis? It predicts that the court will not rule that OMT is illegal. However, it could force new conditions or limits on the programme, as Open Europe puts it: it could set out red lines and restrictions to protect the German Constitution \u2013 this could throw a new element of risk into the crisis. Whatever the ruling, any restrictions have the potential to increase concerns over the speed and extent of actions which the ECB can take to help solve the eurozone crisis. On the flip side, this case could provide further (much needed) insight into the practical workings of OMT. That said, if markets do not like what they hear on this front, this could indeed be a source of risk. Greece's privatisation programme appears to be unravelling. Deputy energy minister Asimakis Papageorgiou has warned in the last few minutes that Athens may have to reconsider the timing of its planned sale of Hellenic Petroleum, the country's biggest oil refiner, following the failed sale of gas supplier DEPA (see 1.21pm). Seperately, Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports that the Greek finance ministry proposed almost the sales tax levied at restaurants, to 13%, this summer in an effort to lure tourists to Greece. Kathimerini explains: The government has long wanted to drop VAT at restaurants from 23 percent to 13 percent but the troika has resisted this proposal because of concerns about a drop in revenues. Greece argues that lower prices would encourage more customers, especially during the tourism season, and revenues would be higher. Athens appears to have proposed that a 6-month reduction be introduced to test the waters. The WSJ's Money Beat have helpfully uploaded S&amp;P's statement, explaining why it raised the US credit rating: S&amp;P Boosts U.S. Credit Outlook In summary, S&amp;P are: 1) more optimistic that US politicians will agree a deal to raise the debt ceiling again without a splurge of government spending 2) encouraged by stronger-than-expected growth from the US private sector, which should help reduce the US deficit below 4% by 2015. Latvia's credit rating has just been raised one notch by Standard &amp; Poor's, to BBB+. Fresh from sprinkling some cheer over America, S&amp;P declared that Latvia was a better credit risk now it had won permission to join the eurozone (as happened last week). Membership of the monetary union will \"reduce Latvia's forex risk and improve monetary flexibility\", S&amp;P added. BBB+ is the 8th highest credit rating, three notches above junk. Here's some instant reaction to the news that S&amp;P has raised the US credit rating outlook to stable: Breaking: Standard &amp; Poor's has raised America's credit rating outlook to 'stable' from 'negative', reducing the threat of a downgrade. The rating remained at AA+, the second highest rating. The move comes 22 months after S&amp;P became the first rating agency to strip America of its AAA rating, in the aftermath of the debt ceiling row. The news pushed the US dollar up against other major currencies (currently 0.2% higher against the euro and the pound). The Greek government has tried to shrug off the disappointment of failing to sell DEPA. Following a meeting with top Troika officials this morning, deputy finance minister Christos Staikouras told reporters that: The country's fiscal picture has improved in the five-month period and reaching a primary budget surplus this year is attainable. As mentioned ealier, the Greek govenrment borrowed \u20ac984m for the first five months of this year, against a target of \u20ac4.2bn. Our correspondent Helena Smith confirms that Greece's attempt to privatise the DEPA gas company have failed, after Gasprom failed to make a bid. Helena tells me that officials are describing Gazprom's withdrawal from the bid to snap up Greece's natural gas corporation, DEPA, as a \"bolt out of the blue.\" She reports: At TAIPED, the country's privatisation fund, officials were not just amazed but stunned. \" We had absolutely no inkling that this would happen,\" said one insider, requesting anonymity because the fund has yet to make an official announcement. \"Alexey Miller [Gazprom's CEO], himself, was overseeing negotiations. It's a complete bolt out of the blue.\" Aides close to all three party leaders in the governing coalition described prime minister Antonis Samaras, who had met Miller three times since March, as \"shocked.\" Many wondered whether the Russian energy giant had decided against submitting a bid after hearing that the EU commission would ultimately veto it. Like the US, the EU has made its distaste for Russia increasing its influence over the bloc's energy market clear. Greek media is describing the failed privatisation as a huge set back for the government. DEPA and the state-run lottery company, OPAP, sold last month, were seen as jewels in the crown of the privatisation process. And the Athens stock market is down almost 6%.... The Athens stock market has taken a 5% tumble today, following reports that the privatisation of DEPA, the Greek gas supply company, has floundered. As explained at 12.19pm, the collapse of the DEPA sale (not yet confirmed) would leave Athens struggling to hit its privatisation targets (an area where it has already lagged behind). There are also suggestions that Greece will not be able to sell gas network operator DESFA to Azerbaijan's SOCAR (the only company that made a bid) if it can't also find a private buyer for DEPA. Reuters explains: It was unclear if a DESFA sale could proceed if DEPA remains in state hands. Failure to sell the companies would also block the planned privatisation later this year of state oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum HEPr.AT, which owns 35 percent of DEPA. \"Greece has received no binding bids for DEPA and one bid from Azerbaijan's SOCAR for DESFA,\" a senior official involved in the sale told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Reports are coming in from Greece that the government's attempts to privatise a natural gas supplier have stumbled. According to Reuters, no firm bids had been received for DEPA when the deadline of 1pm local time (11am BST) was reached. Just one offer was received for DESFA, the gas network operator that was also up for sale. Russia's Gazprom had been seen as the frontrunner to buy DEPA, but it appears that it decided against a bid. An official announcement is expected later today. Without selling DEPA, it's hard to see how Greece could hit its targets for asset sales this year. The news comes as top officials from the Troika returned to Athens this morning to assess whether Greece is meeting targets on economic reforms and deficit reduction. The Greek finance ministry had some good news for them \u2013 Greece's deficit was just \u20ac984m for the first five months of this year, against a target of \u20ac4.2bn. The visit comes just five days since the International Monetary Fund released a report admitting that mistakes were made with Greece's first bailout in 2010. That study has created new tensions beween the IMF, the EU and the European Central Bank -- with the latter two refusing to admit that much went wrong three years ago. Francois Hollande's upbeat declaration that the eurozone crisis is over has been received coolly by traders in Paris, where the CAC 40 index is flat this morning. The Italian market is down following this morning's downward revision to GDP (see 10.42am) and the worse-than-expected industrial data (9.46am). While in London, mining stocks are down following a raft of Chinese data over the weekend (including weak exports growth, falling inflation, and below-expectation bank lending). As Alastair McCaig, market strategist at IG, explains, investors aren't really unconvinced by Hollande's claims: The FTSE has started the week slightly off the pace of its European counterparts, mainly due to some slightly disappointing Chinese economic data that has edged its bloated mining sector lower. This weekend\u2019s comments from French president Francois Hollande appear to be a direct challenge to ECB president Mario Draghi as to who can be the most uber-optimistic. Here's the prices: FTSE 100: up 1 point at 6413 French CAC: up 1 point at 3873 German DAX: up 74 points at 8328, + 0.9% Spanish IBEX: up 5 points at 8271, + 0.06% Italian FTSE MIB: down 17 points at 16693, -0.09% Italy's recession is deeper than thought, as a slump in imports and exports added to fears over the eurozone's third-largest economy. Istat, the country's statistics office, now believes Italian GDP shank by 0.6% in the first three months of this year, not 0.5% as previously thought. It cut its predictions after calculating that imports, exports and investments are all sharply lower than a year ago. And investments are 7.5% lower than a year ago, confirming that companies are hoarding funds rather than spending on new infrastructrure. Government spending was the only section of the economy to actually rise quarter-on-quarter, according to Istat's data: Q1 2013 GDP -0.6% (q/q); -2.4% (y/y) IMPORTS -1.6% (q/q); -5.2% (y/y) FINAL NATIONAL CONSUMPTION -0.3% (q/q); -2.7% (y/y) CONSUMER SPENDING -0.5% (q/q); -3.4% (y/y) GOVT SPENDING 0.1% (q/q); -0.8% (y/y) INVESTMENTS -3.3% (q/q); -7.5% (y/y) EXPORTS -1.9% (q/q); -0.2% (y/y) Better news... investors across the eurozone are more upbeat about the future. The Sentix survey found that optimism increased for the second month running in May. The European Central Bank's interest rate cut, the creation of an Italian government, and the Cypriot bailout all helped -- but people are still pretty cautious. Reuters has more details: Sentix research group said on Monday its monthly index tracking investor sentiment in the 17-nation currency bloc rose to -11.6 in June from -15.6 in May, falling short of a consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for a rise to -10. \"The euro zone index rose for a second consecutive month and appears to have quickly overcome its weakness in the early part of the year when elections in Italy and confusion over the Cyprus bailout weighed,\" Sentix said in a statement. A left-right government finally took power in Italy in late April, some two months after the election, while in Cyprus the parliament approved the painful bailout plan. \"If latest trends continue in the next months then the euro zone can finally return to growth in the coming quarter,\" Sentix added. Francois's Hollande's claim that the eurozone crisis is over would certainly be bolstered if the euro recession ended..... Confirmation that Italy's recession continues -- Italian industrial output has fallen for the third month. Output dropped by another 0.3% in April, meaning it was 4.6% lower than a year ago. This extended the 0.9% month-on-month drop seen in March. Analysts had expected industrial output to be flat in April, but there's no real shock that the picture is worse.... Here's the release from Istat (pdf). Italian industrial output is now over 10% lower than in 2010, today's figures show. According to Reuters it has dropped by a quarter since the financial crisis began. Today's 4.9% surge on the Nikkei drags the index away from bear market territory, reversing a chunk of the recent selloff: Technology firm Sharp led the risers, as the weakening yen fuelled optimism for Japan's exports: Francois Hollande's claim that the eurozone crisis is over (see 8.27am) has not convinced many experts this morning Several analysts point to Europe's record levels of unemployment, saying social unrest could easily drag the region into another panic. Bill Dinning, head of investment at the Coal Pension Trustees, told Bloomberg TV that the youth unemployment crisis was a particular concern. There would be a real problem if people got fed up with those high levels of unemployment and started saying they want to do something about it. Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor, agrees: Hollande's statement that the euro zone crisis is over has fallen on deaf ears as there is little underlying substance to back up his convictions. With euro zone unemployment at a record high and thousands taking to the streets to rally against ongoing austerity measures, investors are struggling to understand how he came to that conclusion. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research points out that eurozone borrowing costs are indeed much lower than at the height of the crisis. But still, we've heard such upbeat talk from European leaders before.... Hollande wins a special prize as that is the 100th time that a leading politician has announced the end of the crisis. All joking aside though it is certainly fair to say that peripheral bond yields would suggest that the crisis is at least taking a break. It has moved from being an immediate liquidity crisis to a potentially slow burn economic crisis. Employment trends in Europe may dictate how it ends. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone and the world economy. First up: it's been a strong day on the Japanese stock market where the Nikkei jumped almost 5% \u2013 its biggest daily rise in over two years \u2013 and the yen weakened. Fears that 'Abenomics' was coming off the rails eased as the country's cabinet office revised its growth figures higher. The Japanese economy actually grew by 4.1% on a year-on-year basis between January and March, it reported, up from 3.5%. Traders were also encouraged by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's announcement on Sunday that he will launch various tax breaks this summer including one to encourage corporates to invest in infrastructure. And with the yen dropping to \u00a598.3 against the US dollar, from \u00a597.5 on Friday, there's a real sense of relief in Japan. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, commented: Japan provided good news in the form of better than expected GDP numbers this morning, increasing confidence in the massive stimulus (Abe-nomics) underway in the world\u2019s #3 economy, designed to rescue it from both economic depression/stagnation and deflation The Nikkei was further helped by a weaker JPY (helped by stronger USD, supportive for exporters) and Prime Minister Abe saying bold tax cuts (including on CAPEX investment) could be part of his grand strategy. Last Friday's US employment data also pushed the Nikkei. The news that 175,000 new jobs were created last month looks like a 'Goldilocks moment' -- warm enough to suggest economic growth, but not so hot as to prompt the Federal Reserve to start 'tapering' its stimulus package. On the downside, though...the latest Chinese economic data has suggested its economy may be slowing more rapidly than thought, which is pushing shares in Europe down this morning (the FTSE 100 is down 20 points in early trading). And what of Europe? Well, its debt crisis is over, according to Francois Hollande. The French president told Japanese business leaders over the weekend that the eurozone has come out of its recent troubles stronger than ever: A cheery Hollande declared: Europe has become more stable, but it must now be oriented toward growth....I believe that the crisis, far from weakening the eurozone, will strengthen it. \"Now, we have all the instruments of stability and solidarity. There was an improvement in the economic governance of the eurozone, we set up a banking union, we have rules on budgetary matters that allow us to be better coordinated and have a form of convergence. Here's the full story: Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: the eurozone crisis is over. Analysts, though, are pointing out that the eurozone still suffers record levels of unemployment, and also remains in recession.... Full reaction to follow, along with other big developments through the day...",

      "bodyText": "Europe's most powerful central bankers are to clash in Germany on Tuesday when the country's supreme court scrutinises the legality of the key instrument deployed by Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, to stabilise the battered single currency. The case at the constitutional court in Karlsruhe pits Germany's Bundesbank against the ECB in a dispute over whether Draghi's promise last year of unlimited intervention in the financial markets to save the euro was legal. Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank, will argue strongly that Draghi's move was illegal as it was tantamount to the direct financing of governments, proscribed under the ECB's statutes. Joerg Asmussen, the German on the ECB board who used to work closely with Weidmann in the Merkel coalition in Berlin, will present the case for Draghi, contending that the policy was necessary to guarantee the euro's stability and thus fulfil the ECB's primary obligation, ensuring monetary stability in the eurozone. Draghi pledged last summer that the ECB would do \"whatever it takes\" to safeguard the euro, and in September he announced a radical new policy known as outright monetary transactions (OMT), under which the ECB could act to save the currency by buying up the bonds of a eurozone government at risk of financial collapse. The policy shift was widely seen as the most effective weapon deployed in three years of the eurozone crisis. \"The ECB is not on trial,\" Asmussen told Germany's Bild newspaper on Monday, warning that there would be \"substantial consequences if the purchase programme was rescinded\". The Bundesbank and the ECB have been at daggers drawn over the role of central banks in the crisis for more than a year, with Weidmann taking the unusual step of dissenting in sessions of the ECB governing council on policy moves. A whispering campaign has been waged in recent weeks on both sides of the Frankfurt divide, with ECB sources muttering privately about the Bundesbank being home to \"opponents of the euro\". Indirectly criticising the way that eurozone leaders and governments have tackled the turmoil of recent years, Asmussen said the ECB was the sole EU institution with any credibility and clout, and Draghi's moves had calmed the markets and thus ensured the euro's survival and secured price stability. He noted that last summer, as Italy and Spain teetered on the brink of financial chaos, \"the euro was close to collapse\". Monetary policy purists at the Bundesbank argue by contrast that the ECB has vastly exceeded its remit in offering to wade into the markets to protect the euro. Launched last September, the \"big bazooka\" of OMT has not yet been used. Draghi set strict conditions on its use and limited its duration to a maximum of three years. Any country benefiting would need to sign up to a programme of fiscal and economic rigour, as in the eurozone's bailouts. It is not clear what the German court, which is not expected to rule finally on the dispute until after general elections in September, can do to stop the ECB as it does not have jurisdiction over the non-German institution. Although it is not viewed as likely, the court would be able to tie the hands of the German government and the Bundesbank or curb its involvement in the ECB policy. Or it could send the dispute to the European court of justice.",

Including Omers' infrastructure arm, Borealis, the fund's $60bn (\u00a339bn) in assets includes a 30-year lease for the High Speed 1 rail route. The Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec owns more than 13% of Heathrow and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan owns stakes in Birmingham Airport and Associated British Ports. Alberta Investment Management was involved in last year's \u00a3200m refinancing of the BBC Television Centre and is an investor in Thames Water. Along with other financial investors from around the globe, Canadian investment funds have been lured to these shores by a reliable legal environment and an open-minded attitude by successive governments to foreign investment. Senior managers at the funds have also expressed support for the coalition's deficit reduction plan, which includes proposals to sell off government assets such as the Royal Mail. The Vue deal comes as the owner of the bigger UCI and Odeon chains, Terra Firma, prepares to float the businesses. Formed in May 2003, Vue Entertainment bought the Apollo UK circuit in May 2012, took over CinemaxX in Germany in July 2012 and swooped on Multikino in Poland in May 2013. Mark Redman, head of Omers' European private equity division, said: \"We are very pleased to be working with Tim Richards, one of the leading industry executives, and his team at Vue to support the business in its next phase of development. This is a best-in-class business featuring a first rate management team.\" He added that the fund intends to be owners for several years rather than performing a quick turnaround and fast sale. He said: \"We like to partner with management teams and present on the basis of patient capital. We don't need to get out quickly and in that respect we are welcomed. We recognise there aren't any fast returns and we want to invest for the long term.\"",

Analyst Josh Lipman said:</p> <blockquote> Management's rejection of CVC's 950p bid, has led us to consider that there could be considerably more upside to pricing changes than we had initially expected. At current commission levels we would value the business at 710p, whereas our sensitivity analysis suggests that a significant increase could lead to around 1200p valuation. <br> Last June, Betfair put up commission rates on Australian horse racing by 30% in response to the introduction of a new turnover tax.

The company has recently announced that it is testing pricing elasticity in five markets, with an increase in four markets and a decrease in one market. We think there is no reason why commission rates need to be universal across geographies, sports, or even across different markets within the same sports. For example in order to attract bettors, we think that in competitive markets such as Premier League football, Betfair may be tempted to leave commission rates as they are or even reduce rates. However, for less competitive markets where bettors may be unable to find better value elsewhere, commissions could be raised.  Our prior forecasts had assumed 20% increase in prices on 50% of the business, with a commensurate 10% decrease in customers. However, we now think that changes to pricing could actually be more extensive and that there is scope to revamp the entire pricing system.  We now assume that on average prices increase by 30% with a 15% loss of customers leading to a 15% net revenue uplift, in line with the findings from Australia. For simplicity, where prices decrease, we assume that this will be by an average of 15% with a customer increase of 30% maintaining this 15% net revenue increase. </blockquote> <p>Betfair shares have jumped 28.5p to 840.5p on the news.</p> <p>Lower down the market, <strong>Xaar</strong> has soared 150p to 788p after the inkjet printing technology group issued an unexpected but strong trading update.

The new plan gives more of its cash resources to senior loan note holders, which it hopes will allow the restructuring to be completed and mean there is no need for another refinancing until 2029. Simon French at Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> Punch has reported a 0.7% decline in like for like net income in its core estate for the 12 weeks to 25 May to bring year to date like for like net income to -3.3%. This reflects improving trends in rental income and beer volumes. <br> The group's Capital Structure Update contains a number of Revised Restructuring Proposals. From an equity perspective the most important is that Improved Covenant Protection for Creditors means there would be no ability to upstream excess cash out of the securitisations (save for \u00a34m to meet on-going group costs and liabilities) compared to the previous proposal of 25% of Punch B cash being upstreamed.  Although over time the equity proportion of the group's enterprise value should increase as the securitisations deleverage it is not clear how equity owners would be able to participate in this upside. As such we reiterate our 7p target price reflecting the group's balance sheet value per share of its shareholding in Matthew Clark, the drink's distribution business; hold. </blockquote>",

Simon French at Panmure Gordon said: Punch has reported a 0.7% decline in like for like net income in its core estate for the 12 weeks to 25 May to bring year to date like for like net income to -3.3%. This reflects improving trends in rental income and beer volumes. The group's Capital Structure Update contains a number of Revised Restructuring Proposals. From an equity perspective the most important is that Improved Covenant Protection for Creditors means there would be no ability to upstream excess cash out of the securitisations (save for \u00a34m to meet on-going group costs and liabilities) compared to the previous proposal of 25% of Punch B cash being upstreamed. Although over time the equity proportion of the group's enterprise value should increase as the securitisations deleverage it is not clear how equity owners would be able to participate in this upside. As such we reiterate our 7p target price reflecting the group's balance sheet value per share of its shareholding in Matthew Clark, the drink's distribution business; hold.",
