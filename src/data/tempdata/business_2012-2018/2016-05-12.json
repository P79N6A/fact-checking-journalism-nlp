      "bodyText": "Britain will make up its mind whether it wants to remain in the European Union in six weeks time, so it was inevitable that the last Bank of England inflation report before 23 June was dominated by the referendum. And make no mistake, the warning from Threadneedle Street about the likely short-term consequences of a Brexit vote \u2013 including a sharp fall in the value of the pound \u2013 is mightily handy for George Osborne. The Bank assumes that there will be a double whammy of weaker growth and higher inflation in the event of a vote to leave. For the first time Mark Carney was even prepared to use the R word: there would be a chance of technical recession - two successive quarters of negative growth - if the decision is to leave. The Bank\u2019s inflation report says Brexit could lead to lower consumer spending, mothballed investment plans, higher unemployment and problems funding the UK\u2019s record current account deficit \u2013 which has reached 7% of GDP. It believes there is a risk that foreign investors will shun the UK and strain the banking system. Carney summed up the Bank\u2019s view in his letter to the chancellor [PDF] explaining why inflation remains more than a percentage point below the government\u2019s 2% target. The combined effect of leaving would, the governor said, be to \u201clower growth materially and raise the rate of inflation materially\u201d over the next couple of years. Osborne\u2019s reply to Carney\u2019s letter showed that he intends to milk the Bank\u2019s warning for all it is worth. The Leave camp noted that despite the Bank\u2019s warnings about sterling, the pound is currently at a higher level than it was when the referendum was called, and that Carney should be careful that his words did not become self-fulfilling prophecies. Nor is it the case, as Osborne has been asserting, that interest rates would inevitably rise after a Brexit vote. The forecasts contained in the Inflation Report assume that the bookies have got it right and that Britain will vote to remain in the European Union. These show that the uncertainty caused by the referendum is temporary, with growth slightly lower in 2016 but picking up in 2017. But by 2018, when everything has come out in the wash, growth is 0.2 points lower than expected at the time of the February inflation report at 2.3%. That\u2019s despite the financial markets taking the view that interest rates will stay lower for longer, and the 9% drop in the value of sterling since November \u2013 both of which should boost growth. But, as the Bank noted, only half the pound\u2019s fall has been the result of uncertainty caused by the referendum. The other half is caused by a realisation that the UK suffers from poor productivity, low levels of investment and a chronically weak trade performance. Those problems are not going to magically disappear whatever the vote on 23 June.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK steelmakers have cheered a European parliament resolution opposing plans that they believe would kill off the industry by permanently opening the floodgates to cheap Chinese steel. MEPs passed a resolution saying China should not be granted market economy status by Brussels, which could make it harder for officials to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese steel. Brussels is due to make a ruling this year. But Conservative MEPs came under fire for failing to back the motion, while European steelmakers called on the UK to get behind efforts to strengthen the trade defences available to EU economies. While the resolution carries no legal weight, steel trade bodies welcomed a move that they said sent a message to politicians that the European steel industry needs protection from China. Gareth Stace, the director of UK Steel, \u201cDespite the rhetoric, China shows no sign of stemming the tidal wave of steel exports which it is dumping on the global market. \u201cIf this status for China is granted, we will see the decimation of steel in Europe with the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. \u201cThe UK government must listen to the message being sent by the European parliament and stand strong with other European countries to oppose China\u2019s calls for market economy status.\u201d European steelmaking body Eurofer also welcomed the resolution. \u201cChina is not a market economy, and thus cannot be treated as such for the purpose of anti-dumping investigations,\u201d said its director general, Axel Eggert. Labour criticised Conservative MEPs after many of them failed to support the resolution. The shadow business secretary, Angela Eagle, said: \u201cUK steel, a vital foundation industry, is hanging by a thread. The main cause of the crisis is the illegal dumping of Chinese steel, but the government has repeatedly failed to act. \u201cGranting market economy status to China would not just be undeserved and absurd, it would frustrate action against dumping. It is a great shame that most Tory MEPs failed to support this crucial vote. \u201cLabour has long been calling for robust action to tackle dumping and save our steel. This motion is a welcome step forward and we hope the Tory government will see this as a wake-up call. They need to stop kowtowing to China and start standing up for our steel industry.\u201d Europe\u2019s steel industry also called on the UK to stop blocking measures mooted by members of the European council that would allow European countries to upgrade the \u201ctrade defence instruments\u201d available to them. Eurofer said: \u201cThe inability of the council to come to an agreement is a disaster for the steel industry, as we are regularly targeted by unfair trade from third countries. \u201cWe call on the Dutch EU presidency, as well as the UK, to take responsibility now and lift the obstruction blocking the creation of more effective trade defence instruments.\u201d The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills hit back at the suggestion that it was blocking efforts that could help steelmakers. \u201cWe should not confuse the market economy status issue with the current situation in the steel industry,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cRussia has market economy status and the EU has taken anti-dumping measures against Russia. \u201cIf China is granted market economy status, the EU will still be able to take action on unfair trade practices and impose anti-dumping measures. And there would also be no effect on the EU\u2019s ability to tackle Chinese subsidies through anti-subsidy actions.\u201d Proposals to upgrade Europe\u2019s trade defence measures are set to be discussed at a meeting of the European council on Friday. Industrial trade alliance Aegis said: \u201cA fair partnership is only possible if China plays by the rules of free and fair international trade, and honours its WTO obligations. \u201cSo long as China remains a planned economy, which builds up irrational over-capacities, and encourages its industries to dump in foreign markets, Europe cannot grant it market economy status. \u201cInstead, European anti-dumping defence tools must be strengthened in compliance with World Trade Organization rules.\u201d European efforts to stem the tide of Chinese steel come as the UK industry is in crisis, having shed more than 5,000 jobs since last summer. Indian conglomerate Tata is in the process of selling its Tata Steel UK division, which employs about 12,000 people, but its \u00a315bn pension fund is proving to be a stumbling block for the seven firms interested in a deal. The government is reported to be weighing up a plan to make the British Steel pension scheme, which Tata took on after buying Corus in 2007, less burdensome to potential buyers. Proposals include linking the scheme\u2019s accrual rate to the consumer price index measure of inflation, which is lower than the retail price index measure currently used. The plan could trim \u00a32.5bn off the long-term liabilities of the 135,000-member scheme, the Financial Times reported. The seven companies in the running to buy Tata Steel UK include Liberty House, which recently bought two Scottish steel mills from Tata, a management buyout team known as Excalibur and investment firm Greybull Capital, which is in the middle of a deal to buy Tata\u2019s UK long products division. The other shortlisted parties are India\u2019s JSW Steel, China\u2019s Hebei Iron &amp; Steel Group, Nucor Corporation from the US and restructuring firm Endless. The US billionaire Wilbur Ross, who specialises in buying distressed businesses, has also been linked with a late offer.",

Beijing is desperate to be granted market economy status within the World Trade Organisation but is running into stiff opposition from both the US and Europe. With Chinese steel being dumped on global markets, the European parliament on Thursday voted against the idea that China should be treated the same as the EU or the US by a thumping margin. The decision puts pressure on the European commission to either oppose market economic status outright or include safeguards for specific industries. Market economy status (or MES) matters to the Chinese for both symbolic and practical reasons. It would be a sign that the country is being treated as an equal by the west and it would make it more difficult to impose tariffs on Chinese goods in anti-dumping cases. Beijing says MES was guaranteed when it joined the WTO in 2001. But many of China\u2019s trading partners believe it doesn\u2019t deserve to be treated as a proper market economy, because the state makes all the important calls when it comes to investment decisions. There is merit in this criticism. Beijing has flooded the global market with cheap steel, avoiding higher unemployment at home by causing job losses elsewhere, including in the UK. The anger felt in Europe and America is wholly understandable, and comes at a time when Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have helped move US trade policy in a much more protectionist direction. Brokering a compromise deal is not going to be easy. It would represent a big loss of face for China to be deprived of MES, but the 546-28 vote in the European parliament is an indication of the mounting anti-China mood in the west. All the ingredients are there for a trade war.",

It would be a sign that the country is being treated as an equal by the west and it would make it more difficult to impose tariffs on Chinese goods in anti-dumping cases.</p> <p>Beijing says MES was guaranteed when it joined the WTO in 2001. But many of China\u2019s trading partners believe it doesn\u2019t deserve to be treated as a proper market economy, because the state makes all the important calls when it comes to investment decisions.</p> <p>There is merit in this criticism. Beijing has flooded the global market with cheap steel, avoiding higher unemployment at home by causing job losses elsewhere, including in the UK. The anger felt in Europe and America is wholly understandable, and comes at a time when Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have helped move US trade policy in a much more protectionist direction.</p> <p>Brokering a compromise deal is not going to be easy.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned for the first time that Britain could slide into recession in the aftermath of a vote to leave the EU in next month\u2019s referendum. Governor Mark Carney also warned Brexit could knock the pound sharply lower, stoke inflation and raise unemployment. That would leave the Bank with a difficult balancing act as it decides whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates to counter opposing forces, Carney added. He said there were a range of possible scenarios for the economy in the event of Brexit and these \u201ccould possibly include a technical recession\u201d \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP. \u201cA vote to leave the EU could have material economic effects \u2013 on the exchange rate, on demand and on the economy\u2019s supply potential \u2013 that could affect the appropriate setting of monetary policy,\u201d Carney told a news conference. He was speaking as the Bank released its latest forecasts for the economy showing a softer outlook for growth and as it announced a decision to hold interest rates at their record low of 0.5%. With the 23 June referendum clouding the economic outlook, all nine of the Bank\u2019s interest rate setting committee agreed borrowing costs should be left on hold. Against the backdrop of tight opinion polls, the Bank described the referendum on EU membership as \u201cthe most immediate and significant risk\u201d for the UK\u2019s economic outlook. Minutes from the committee\u2019s meeting showed it discussed the implications of both a vote to remain in the EU \u2013 seen as the more likely outcome based on current polls \u2013 and a vote to leave. It was the Bank\u2019s most detailed assessment yet of potential Brexit effects. The Bank warned a vote to leave the EU could: Push the pound lower, \u201cperhaps sharply\u201d. Prompt households and businesses to delay spending. Increase unemployment. Hit economic growth. Stoke inflation. Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThe implication is that UK recession would be a very real risk.\u201d Carney also warned of the risk of a spillover to international markets from the uncertainty around the vote, saying almost everyone he met wanted to talk about Brexit. \u201cThis issue is the No 1 issue that is raised with me and my colleagues every time we meet another central banker, finance minister, the head of a major corporation, and most small business owners.\u201d The governor\u2019s remarks brought renewed criticism from campaigners for the UK to leave the EU. The former chancellor Lord Lamont accused Carney of carelessness, and said \u201ca prudent governor would simply have said that \u2018we are prepared for all eventualities\u2019.\u201d \u201cThe governor should be careful that he doesn\u2019t cause a crisis. If his unwise words become self-fulfilling, the responsibility will be the governor\u2019s and the governor\u2019s alone,\u201d said Lamont. \u201cThere are huge opportunities for the UK outside the EU. We are a strong economy and can stand on our own two feet like all other modern, independent countries.\u201d But Carney defended his intervention as legitimate and cited the Bank\u2019s responsibility to explain any \u201cmajor risk\u201d to its forecasts. The Bank noted the pound had already depreciated 9% since a November peak and that half of that was down to the \u201crisks associated with a vote to leave the European Union\u201d. Carney further expounded the risks of a leave vote in a letter to George Osborne, one of the leading figures in the campaign to remain in the EU. The letter was the latest in a series, regularly sent to explain why inflation was still far below the Bank\u2019s government-set target of 2%, but this time it contained a lengthy section about the referendum. The chancellor seized on Carney\u2019s remarks as showing \u201cBritain would be poorer\u201d in the event of Brexit. On the Bank\u2019s predicted trade-off, Osborne said any outcome would \u201cimpose costs on families\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is the kind of lose-lose situation that a vote to leave the EU creates.\u201d However, Carney and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee were careful to note that there were factors weighing on the UK economy beyond next month\u2019s referendum. Those included the state of households\u2019 finances against the backdrop of further government cuts, the outlook for the UK\u2019s relatively weak productivity performance, and the prospects for the global economy. The Bank also warned against expecting a rapid rebound in economic activity in the event of a vote to stay in the EU given some business projects that had been deferred before the vote could take time to restart. The inflation report\u2019s forecasts were made on the basis the UK remains in the EU, keeping to the usual practice used before general elections of assuming the status quo prevails. The Bank\u2019s view of the global economy had changed little since the last report in February. But it cut the outlook for the domestic economy to GDP growth of 2% this year, down from 2.2% pencilled in back in February. David Cameron also capitalised on the Bank\u2019s Brexit warnings. He tweeted: There was more support for the remain campaign from the White House, where the chairman of the council of economic advisers said a vote to leave the EU would hurt Britain and Europe as well as the global economy. Jason Furman told Germany\u2019s Handelsblatt newspaper: \u201cYou can certainly argue about whether the damage a Brexit would cause would be small, medium or big but it would definitely cause damage, especially for the Brits but also for the Europeans and the global economy.\u201d He added: \u201cWe don\u2019t need more uncertainty at the moment.\u201d",

In a move that adds momentum to the wave of protests over executive pay, shareholders in the Restaurant Group protested against a payment to departing chairman Alan Jackson and bonuses paid to other directors. The results of the vote at its annual general meeting on Thursday show that 27% of shareholders voted against the remuneration report, a level of dissent which rose to 33% when deliberate abstentions were included. The vote is advisory, although the company acknowledged the scale of the protest, describing a \u201csignificant number of votes\u201d being cast against the pay report. \u201cThe company understands that this reflects the concerns of a number of investors in respect of the termination arrangements for Alan Jackson and the level of the executive director annual bonus awards for 2015. \u201cThe remuneration committee will carry out a detailed review of all of the feedback received to understand fully all of the reasons behind the vote result so that it can reflect, where appropriate, in its approach going forward,\u201d Restaurant Group said.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight. Here\u2019s our latest news story on the Bank of England\u2019s Brexit intervention: Goodnight! GW Mark Carney dire warnings over Brexit didn\u2019t help the mood in the stock markets today. The FTSE 100 has just closed for the night, down 58 points or almost 1% at 6104. That\u2019s the lowest level in 5 weeks. Mining stocks are down, led by Anglo American (-6.8%), which usually shows worries about the global economy, along with tech firm ARM (-4%) and pharma group Shire (-3%). Chris Beauchamp, Senior Market Analyst at IG, says: The weakness in London has been broad-based, which should raise warning signs that this is not just a mining-related selloff. Instead, it seems investors are heading for the exits once again, threatening a further unwind of the gains made since mid-February. Over in New York, Apple\u2019s shares have slid below the $90 mark for the first time since 2014. That means it\u2019s worth slightly less than Alphabet (parent company of Google). Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, predicts that UK interest rates could be raised before Christmas -- if the Remain campaign wins next month. \u201cWith inflation marginally above the Bank\u2019s target two-years forward, our long-held belief that market expectations on interest rate hikes are far too pessimistic has been confirmed. Assuming the economy recovers in the second half, we expect to see a UK interest rate rise near the end of 2016 or soon after.\u201d Back to the Bank of England, and Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, has a good take on Mark Carney\u2019s Brexit dilemma: The central problem facing the Bank in the event of a Brexit is to balance rising inflation from a weak pound with the downward pressures from a slump in demand. The assumption is that rates will have to rise in the event of a Brexit to stem a run on the pound, but Carney\u2019s suggesting something rather different. His point is sensible \u2013 we may not get the runaway inflation that many are expecting if the shock of Brexit means households stop spending. Moreover, a vote to leave would hit the euro hard, which would offset a decent amount of pound weakness. He also reckons correctly that the impact of lower rates on prices will not be felt instantly, meaning he has time on his hands to cut rates to temper the effects on aggregate demand that a Brexit shock would entail. Effectively he could cut rates immediately after the referendum to support demand, and then look to raise them afterwards if inflation does start to overshoot.\u201d Here\u2019s JP Morgan\u2019s Stephanie Flanders: This is from the BBC\u2019s business journalist Adam Parsons: We have some sad news to report. Danny Gabay, the respected City economist who founded Fathom Consulting, has passed away at the age of 47. Fathom have issued this statement: Danny, whose funeral took place yesterday, was diagnosed with a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer five and a half years ago. The diagnosis came just before his son Raphael\u2019s second birthday and his wife was seven months pregnant with their daughter, Isabella. In true \u2018Danny Gabay spirit\u2019 he wasn\u2019t going to take it lying down and fought it, tooth and nail, with dignity and incredible bravery. He defeated all the odds and had four and a half good years after his initial operation. Sadly the tumour returned last summer and appeared again in the last couple of months when he finally succumbed to it. Erik Britton, friend and Co-Director at Fathom Consulting commented: \u201cHis passing is a great loss not only to his family, friends and colleagues, but also to the wider economics community. Fathom Consulting is committed to continuing Danny\u2019s great work and to commemorate his passing will be making a donation to the Marie Curie Hospice in Hampstead where he spent his last few days.\u201d His sister Dalia added: \u201cDanny was a sharp, astutely intelligent, loving and caring individual with an outrageous sense of humour. He was also a huge inspiration to many. However, his greatest achievement in life, in fact, his pride and absolute joy, were his two beautiful children that he has left behind: Raphael and Isabella. My pledge to my brother was to always be there for his children and to never, ever let them forget what a wonderful father, husband, son, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin and friend he was to all who met him.\u201d Danny had an impressive career, advising government ministers in his early 20s before moving to the Bank of England, and later JP Morgan, before founding Fathom. Simon Kennedy of Bloomberg tweets: City grandee Lord Paul Myners, who was a government minister during the 2008 financial crisis, has welcomed Mark Carney\u2019s comments: Myners (a Remain supporter), says: \u201cThe Governor of the Bank of England could not be clearer: leaving the EU would lead to lower growth and a plummeting pound. It is a risk we cannot afford to take. \u201cThe evidence is now overwhelming that staying in Europe will mean more jobs, lower prices and more financial security for British families.\u201d Lord Lamont, who was chancellor of the UK from 1990 to 1993, has blasted Mark Carney for his Brexit comments. In a statement just released, Lamont suggests Carney\u2019s remarks could spook the economy: The Governor should be careful that he doesn\u2019t cause a crisis. If his unwise words become self-fulfilling, the responsibility will be the Governor\u2019s and the Governor\u2019s alone. A prudent Governor would simply have said that \u201cwe are prepared for all eventualities\u201d. \u2018There are huge opportunities for the UK outside the EU. We are a strong economy and can stand on our own two feet like all other modern, independent countries.\u2019 Lamont, who is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, knows a thing or two about crises. He was running the Treasury during Black Wednesday in 1992, when Britain crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. A young David Cameron was an advisor, as this famous photo shows: The Institute of Directors is urging businesses to listen to Mark Carney. James Sproule, the IoD\u2019s chief economist, says: \u201cThe Bank of England has highlighted its concerns over the impact the referendum is having on business, and the even greater impact that it could still have on the economy. No matter what they eventually decide, every business in Britain should be giving very serious consideration to the concerns the Bank articulates.\u201d The editor of the FT, Lionel Barber, tweets that the BoE governor has given up being impartial: Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Economics Director, has welcomed Mark Carney\u2019s comments: \u201cThe evidence that a vote to leave the EU would make a serious dent in our economy, jobs and prosperity is overwhelming and still growing. \u201cThe continued lack of a realistic argument on how the UK economy would be better off outside the EU is revealing. \u201cIf a different conclusion could be credibly shown, leave campaigners would have done so by now with fewer than 50 days before the vote.\u201d Iain Duncan Smith, the pro-Brexit former Work and Pensions secretary, has dismissed the Bank of England\u2019s concerns: We had expected some comments on Brexit today, but the Bank of England has gone rather further than expected. By saying that voting to leaving the EU could prompt a recession, Mark Carney has handed the government another weapon against the Brexit campaign. He predicted a material slowdown in growth and a notable increase in inflation. \u201cOf course there\u2019s a range of possible scenarios around those directions, which could possibly include a technical recession.\u201d Carney also revealed that he gets buttonholed about Brexit, a lot. This issue is the number one issue that is raised with me and my colleagues every time we meet another central banker, a finance minister, the head of a major corporation, and most small business owners. Such comments are going to fuel criticism that the Bank of England is failing to be independent and impartial. Carney denied this, saying: It is a judgement not based on a whim... It is the judgement of the independent MPC and it is the judgement of all members of the MPC. He\u2019s also reminded us that central bankers cannot be expected to solve every crisis -- monetary policy is not unlimited, and its effects are not instantaneous. As he put it: There are limits, however, to what monetary policy can deliver... monetary policy cannot immediately offset all the effects of a shock.\u201d Final question. Q: Vote Leave\u2019s official position is that Britain would leave the single market; is that a worry? Carney says there would be implications for the level of financial service activity in the UK if we had a \u2018WTO relationship\u2019 with the EU. [I think that\u2019s because of the \u2018passporting\u2019 arrangements that currently allow banks to base in London and then offer financial services across the EU] Carney also admits that the Bank can\u2019t be sure how the underlying economy is performing, because of the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote. Q: Should the Bank of England really be changing its schedule to only hold eight meetings a year, not 12, given the threats to the economy? Carney says it\u2019s not a problem. We could meet anytime, if needed, he says, indeed the MPC could hold a meeting right now! Q: Will the Bank be announcing further measures to protect the economy around the referendum vote? Never say never, Carney replies. But we learned with Scotland that it\u2019s best to release liquidity facilities well in advance, so people don\u2019t think we\u2019re signalling potential threats. The bank\u2019s PRA (Prudential Regulatory Authority) is also working with financial firms to ensure they are taking precautions. Q: How long would it take for the uncertainty over the EU referendum to fade? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says that the Bank has done some work on this. It believes that the uncertainty should fade relatively quickly, as we know exactly when the vote takes place. But it still believes the effects could still be felt early into next year, even if Remain win. Carney pledges there will be no shortage of liquidity for banks if Britain votes to leave the EU. Q: Isn\u2019t this more Project Fear? Why has the Bank not considered the benefits from Brexit, such as a cheaper pound helping exports and less regulation? Carney reiterates that the Bank is just following its mandate by explaining its concerns about the EU referendum. Q: Are you saying that the Bank would be powerless to stop Britain falling into recession? Monetary policy has a lag, so if there is a sharp drop in activity from any event it takes time for stimulus to feed through and cushion that demand, Carney replies. (That sounds like a yes). He also points out that it\u2019s not automatically clear whether the Bank would raise or lower interest rates in the event of a Brexit vote. Q: Did the MPC discuss the impact that a Leave vote would have on the international markets and the global economy? There is a risk of a spillover to the international markets from the uncertainty around the EU referendum, Carney responds. He then says that almost everyone he meets wants to talk about Brexit: This issue is the number 1 issue that is raised with me and my colleagues every time we meet another central banker, finance ministers, the head of a major corporation, and most small business owners. Q: What tools could the Bank use to stimulate the economy if it suffered a \u2018sudden stop\u2019? Our judgement is that we can lower interest rates further, before turning to unconventional measures, says Mark Carney. Those unconventional measures include quantitative easing (buying government bonds from banks with newly created money), and credit easing. Deputy governor Minouche Shafit then explains that the Bank is holding three liquidity auctions around the referendum date, to ensure banks don\u2019t run short of cash. There are also \u2018swap lines\u2019 with other central banks, which could be used to get more foreign currency into the system if needed. Q: Is George Osborne right to say that the Bank is warning that Brexit would be a \u2018lose-lose\u2019 for Britain? Carney declines to comment on the chancellor\u2019s tweet (see earlier), saying Osborne answers for himself. The Bank is just trying to outline its views on the economy, and explain how it might react. Q: Can you give more detail about how the pound would fall after a Brexit vote, and would it bounce back? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says the Bank hasn\u2019t made any numerical forecasts about Brexit, including for the exchange rate. But the prospect of Britain leaving the EU has had a \u2018dampening effect\u2019 on sterling already. There\u2019s a wide range of factors, Broadbent says, making it very hard to make forecasts. If there were changes to tariffs, that could have a long-term impact on the pound. While if the risk-premium on UK assets rose, sterling could \u2018overshoot\u2019 in the short term. Q: Your comments on Brexit go much further than during the Scottish independence compaign - why, and why today? Carney defends his comments - the EU referendum is the biggest domestic risk to the UK, so the MPC has a duty to talk about how it would respond. We have to communicate those risks - it would be a political decision if our views were suppressed. During the Scottish referendum campaign, the Bank was mainly concerned with the impact of banks moving their headquarters from Scotland to London. And we\u2019re talking about it today because the quarterly inflation report is being published. A technical recession means two quarters of negative growth, so Carney appears to be suggesting that the UK could contract through the second half of this year if the Leave campaign wins June\u2019s referendum. Onto questions, and the BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed grabs the \u2018elephant in the room\u2019 by the ears: Q: Can you rule out Britain falling into recession if we vote to leave EU? Mark Carney says the bank\u2019s central forecast is based on the conclusion that Britain remains in the EU, and that the uncertainty over the vote dissipates fairly quickly If there were a vote to leave, there would be a material impact on growth and demand, and unemployment. We are trying to explain how we would react to that. Q: Does \u2018materially lower growth mean recession? Carney says there are a range of views contained within the forecasts, and then admits that \u201cit could possibly include a technical recession\u201d. Carney concludes his statement by saying that the people of Britain will make a significant decision on June 23, and they will consider a much wider range of issues than just monetary policy. Whatever the public decides, the MPC will address the consequences for growth and inflation. But there are limits to what monetary policy can do. The Bank cannot offset the full impact of a Brexit vote. The EU referendum is the \u2018elephant in the room\u2019, says Mark Carney. He warns that it is making it hard for the Bank to read the current economic data . There is a risk that we could be over, or under-estimating the underlying momentum in the economy in the event that Britain remains in the EU says Carney. A vote for Brexit would have a \u201cmaterial\u201d impact on the economy, he says. Mark Carney begins the press conference with some history - reminding us that the UK recovery began three years ago, making Britain the fastest growing G7 country. But growth has slowed at the start of this year, and appears to be decelerating further This reflects the EU referendum, Carney declares, which has \u201cpushed up uncertainty measures to levels not seen since the eurozone crisis.\u201d He cites the Bank\u2019s conclusion that Brexit fears are responsible for half of the fall in pound since November. The Bank of England is giving a press conference on the inflation report right now. It\u2019s being streamed online here. Here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s news story on the Bank of England\u2019s warning: This chart, from the inflation report, shows how the pound has slumped by 9% in the last six months - partly due to the EU vote. The report is online here. This looks like the Bank of England\u2019s most significant intervention yet in the EU referendum debate. As well as warning about the impact on unemployment and growth, the BoE has also admitted that it will face a tricky balancing act whether to cut or raise interest rates in the event of Brexit. From the Bank, my colleague Katie Allen reports: A vote to leave the EU risks sending the pound sharply lower, stoking inflation, raising unemployment and denting economic growth, the Bank as England warned as its policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates at their record low. Describing the 23 June referendum on EU membership as \u201cthe most immediate and significant risk\u201d for the UK\u2019s economic outlook, the central bank said it would face a difficult balancing act in deciding whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates in the aftermath of a vote to leave the bloc. Updating financial markets against the backdrop of tight opinion polls, the Bank\u2019s policymakers warned that in the event of a so-called Brexit they would have to react to opposing forces of lower growth and higher inflation because a fall in sterling would raise import prices. Publishing a swathe of documents, including minutes to the latest rate-setting meeting and new quarterly forecasts, the Bank made its most forthright remarks yet on the possible impact of a leave vote. With the referendum clouding the economic outlook and weighing on business confidence, the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s (MPC) nine members all voted to leave rates at 0.5%. The minutes revealed the MPC discussed the implications of both a vote to remain in the EU \u2013 currently seen as the more likely outcome based on polls \u2013 and a vote to leave. \u201cA vote to leave the European Union could materially affect the outlook for output and inflation. In the face of greater uncertainty about the UK\u2019s trading relationships, sterling was likely to depreciate further, perhaps sharply. \u201cIn addition, households could defer consumption and firms could delay investment decisions, lowering labour demand and increasing unemployment.\u201d The Bank noted the pound had already depreciated 9% since a November peak and that half of that was down to the \u201crisks associated with a vote to leave the European Union\u201d. The prime minister is also tweeting: Chancellor George Osborne has swiftly responded to the Bank\u2019s concerns about Brexit, arguing it bolsters the Remain campaign. The Bank of England has reiterated its worries about Britain leaving the European Union. In the minutes of this month\u2019s meeting, it says that the risk of Brexit is already hurting the economy: There are increasing signs that uncertainty associated with the EU referendum has begun to weigh on activity. And the BoE fears that the economy could suffer a stark shock if Britain votes to leave the European Union on June 23, which could drive unemployment up. A vote to leave the EU could materially alter the outlook for output and inflation, and therefore the appropriate setting of monetary policy. Households could defer consumption and firms delay investment, lowering labour demand and causing unemployment to rise. The minutes are online here. As feared, the Bank of England has also cut its growth forecasts. It now expects the UK to grow by 2.0% this year. That is a downgrade compared to February\u2019s forecasts, when it expected growth of 2.2%. Here we go! The Bank of England has voted 9-0 to leave interest rates at their current record low of 0.5%. Just 10 minutes to go until the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision, and publishes the quarterly inflation report. Economist Mark Astley, who used to work at the BoE, reckons dovish MPC members are unlikely to actually vote to cut rates. Mark Carney won\u2019t be able to avoid talking about the EU referendum at his 12.30pm press conference, predicts Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank. Concerning the press conference, questions will be geared towards the BoE view on \u201cBrexit\u201d. Carney will be undoubtedly prepared for this and will tread cautiously over every neutral, unbiased response. This minefield should generate pound volatility but nothing lasting, barring Carney going rogue. The focus of the inflation report will be the extent of the BoE adjustment of forecasts and contingency plans after the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote. We expect that any mention of the event will be limited due to the Bank\u2019s effort to appear neutral. Yet, it will be difficult for BoE\u2018s Carney to stay balanced as his prior views suggest that \u201cBrexit\u201d poses a massive economic risk to the UK. Rosenstreich also predicts that the MPC will vote 9-0 to leave interest rates unchanged. City AM have written a handy Super Thursday checklist, here. Basically, we should watch out for: A rate hike (Spoiler alert: this won\u2019t happen) Whether the decision is unanimous -- some economists predict one, or even two, votes for a rate cut New forecasts - including a likely downgrade to 2016 growth from 2.2% to 2% Messages to the market: perhaps a hint that rates will rise faster than investors expect (a trick the Bank tried back in 2014) Any Brexit comments from Mark Carney - he won\u2019t want to say anything overtly political, but can hardly ignore June\u2019s vote Mark Carney will probably also be quizzed about the UK housing market today. A new report shows that the average London house price has virtually doubled since 2009, to an eye-watering \u00a3600,000. House prices in the capital are rising by 11%, outpacing the rest of the UK. And astonishingly, an old garage in Hammersmith was just auctioned for \u00a3466,000 - possibly to someone planning to build the house of their dreams. Two years ago, Carney said rising house prices were the biggest risk to the recovery, and he recently hinted that the Bank could rein in buy-to-let lending. However, there are also signs that the market is cooling. LSL, which owns Your Move and Reeds Rains estate agents, says it handled 20,000 fewer sales in April, as demand dropped in the weeks after the introduction of higher stamp duty for buyers of second homes and investment properties. Every City economist polled in the run-up to today\u2019s meeting expects the Bank of England to leave interest rates on hold. Borrowing costs have been pegged at 0.5% since March 2009, so the \u2018rate hike\u2019 button is looking pretty dusty: European stock markets have fallen in early trading as economic growth fears swirl through the City. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 46 points, or 0.75%, to 6115 points, and there are heavier losses in Paris and Frankfurt. Traders are expecting a gloomy Super Thursday, once the Bank of England releases its quarterly inflation forecast and decision on interest rates. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains why: Whilst rates will inevitably remain unchanged the focus will be on whether any of the 9 Monetary Policy Committee members vote for a cut this afternoon, with Andy Haldane and Gertjan Vlieghe the likeliest candidates for a walk on the dovish side. Beyond the headline rate vote the central bank will reveal its revised forecasts for the UK\u2019s growth, and things don\u2019t look pretty. Following on from the weak Q1 GDP estimate [0.4%], the limp growth figures revealed by NIESR yesterday, and the sickly showing from the manufacturing and industrial sectors over the last few months, it is likely that the BoE will slash expectations for 2016 to 2% from 2.2%. The Brexit question will dominate the agenda at the Bank of England today, predict Bloomberg. They write: The pre-vote nerves are manifesting themselves in the pound. A gauge of hedging for sterling losses versus the dollar climbed to the highest since 2003. While sterling has recovered from the seven-year low against greenback that it reached in February, it\u2019s still the worst-performing Group-of-10 currency in 2016. This chart shows that many investors have been buying protection against the pound tumbling against the US dollar: Governor Mark Carney will endure a tricky press conference today, predicts Sam Hill of RBC Capital Markets. And that\u2019s because the looming Brexit vote will have a massive impact on interest rates. Hill explains: Essentially, neither Governor Carney, nor the MPC collectively, are likely to want to be drawn into issuing a significantly new or decisive message about the future path of monetary policy at this stage, if they believe the optimal path for rates (and asset purchases) is dependent on which way the vote goes Hill also predicts that the BoE will raise its inflation forecasts. That\u2019s because the oil price has recently recovered, the pound has weakened, and the markets expect interest rates to be lower for even longer (as this chart shows): City economists are adamant that the Bank of England will leave interest rates unchanged today: But there is chatter that at least one policymaker will vote for a cut. The most likely doves are chief economist Andy Haldane, and former hedge fund economist Gertjan Vlieghe. Good morning. All eyes are on the Bank of England this morning, as the UK central bank holds its latest Super Thursday. The BoE will publish its quarterly Inflation Report \u2013 its assessment of the UK economy \u2013 at noon, and City experts predict it will cut its growth forecasts quite sharply. With British industry falling back into recession yesterday, the Bank will likely conclude that its previous forecasts were too optimistic. Previously, it expected the economy to expand by 2.2% during 2016; that could be lowered to 2%. The big issue looming over the UK economy, of course, is June\u2019s EU referendum. The most recent economic data has shown that the possibility of Brexit has hurt confidence, and made firms put spending decisions on ice. So, the Bank\u2019s economists will have tried to calculate the impact on growth and inflation. Governor Mark Carney faces a grilling from the press from 12.30pm BST. They\u2019ll surely quiz him about the referendum, and what preparations being made in case the UK votes to leave the EU. The Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will also vote on whether to move interest rates today. And it\u2019s not impossible that some MPC members will push to CUT borrowing costs to fresh record lows. That would be a serious signal that all isn\u2019t well in the UK economy. Most, though, will surely want to leave rates at 0.5%, at least until the EU vote is out of the way. We\u2019ll track all the action at the Bank, and other events through the day....",

The diagnosis came just before his son Raphael\u2019s second birthday and his wife was seven months pregnant with their daughter, Isabella. In true \u2018Danny Gabay spirit\u2019 he wasn\u2019t going to take it lying down and fought it, tooth and nail, with dignity and incredible bravery. He defeated all the odds and had four and a half good years after his initial operation. Sadly the tumour returned last summer and appeared again in the last couple of months when he finally succumbed to it.</p> <p><strong>Erik Britton</strong>, friend and Co-Director at Fathom Consulting commented: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cHis passing is a great loss not only to his family, friends and colleagues, but also to the wider economics community. Fathom Consulting is committed to continuing Danny\u2019s great work and to commemorate his passing will be making a donation to the Marie Curie Hospice in Hampstead where he spent his last few days.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>His sister <strong>Dalia</strong> added: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cDanny was a sharp, astutely intelligent, loving and caring individual with an outrageous sense of humour. He was also a huge inspiration to many. However, his greatest achievement in life, in fact, his pride and absolute joy, were his two beautiful children that he has left behind: Raphael and Isabella. My pledge to my brother was to always be there for his children and to never, ever let them forget what a wonderful father, husband, son, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin and friend he was to all who met him.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Danny had an impressive career, advising government ministers in his early 20s before moving to the Bank of England, and later JP Morgan, before founding Fathom.</p> <p>Simon Kennedy of Bloomberg tweets:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/simonjkennedy/status/730758304356519936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Saddened by the passing of Danny Gabay, a provocative and innovative economist.

      "bodyText": "Dong Energy, the Danish company that has invested \u00a36bn in UK offshore wind power, is planning to float in what would be one of Europe\u2019s biggest listings this year. Dong is already the single largest investor in UK offshore wind projects and plans a further \u00a35bn of spending over the next five years. The state-owned utility said it intended to launch an initial public offering (IPO) on Nasdaq Copenhagen, but would not comment on the potential valuation of the company. However, analysts estimated it could be valued at about 80bn Danish kroner (\u00a38.5bn), making it Denmark\u2019s largest ever flotation. \u201cBarring unforeseen circumstances and subject to prevailing market conditions, the IPO could be launched for a listing in summer 2016,\u201d the company said in a statement on Thursday. Dong employs 700 people in Britain, where its assets include the 175-turbine London Array windfarm off the Kent coast, which was the world\u2019s biggest windfarm when it was built in 2012. The company has also committed to the Hornsea One facility, off the east Yorkshire coast, which will be the largest offshore windfarm when it is completed in 2020. Some analysts have put the cost at up to \u00a33bn. Dong said its UK windfarms meet the electricity needs of 2m homes, which will rise to 3.3m when projects under construction are operational. It is in the process of transforming itself from a high- to low-carbon power producer, and its chief executive, Henrik Poulsen, said the flotation was a \u201cstepping stone\u201d in that process. He said: \u201cWe have a robust and highly visible build-out plan for offshore wind, which will deliver strong and profitable growth in the coming years. \u201cThe planned IPO will create a strong platform for Dong Energy as we continue to lead the transformation of the energy system.\u201d If the IPO goes ahead as planned, Dong said shareholders would sell about 15% of the existing shares. The Danish government \u2013 a majority shareholder with almost 59% \u2013 will sell part of its stake but maintain a 50.1% share of the business. Poulsen said: \u201cThe IPO will raise the profile of the company, not only locally but globally. We\u2019ll have a much more diverse global investor base.\u201d The company will not issue any new share capital as part of the IPO. Claus Hjort Frederiksen, Denmark\u2019s finance minister, said: \u201cWe are proud of Dong Energy\u2019s development in renewable energy and its contribution to a sustainable future. \u201cThe IPO has the support of a broad majority in parliament, and we look forward to following the company\u2019s continued journey as a listed company.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Eight years after the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland, prosecutors have concluded there is insufficient evidence of criminal behaviour to bring charges against the bank or any of its directors. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, Scotland\u2019s prosecution service, said a team of specialist forensic accountants and banking experts had examined 160,000 documents before reaching its conclusion. The Crown Office focused on the cash call to raise \u00a312bn that RBS embarked on between April and June 2008, just before its taxpayer bailout in October that year. The investigation was prompted by the December 2011 publication of the report by the then Financial Services Authority into the bank\u2019s near collapse. The report found \u201cmultiple poor decisions\u201d caused the crisis that led to the \u00a345bn bailout. The prosecutor said: \u201cThe failure of RBS is an issue of great public concern..... The Crown\u2019s investigation focused on the rights issue of April \u2013 June 2008, and involved detailed consideration of whether there was any evidence of criminal conduct associated with the rights issue. \u201cIf there were such evidence those responsible would face prosecution. If not, the public in Scotland could be reassured that the matter had been properly investigated. \u201cFollowing careful examination of all the evidence seen to date, Crown Counsel have decided that there is insufficient evidence in law of criminal conduct either in relation to RBS as an institution or any directors or other senior management involved in the rights issue.\u201d At the time of the rights issue \u2013 the cash call on investors in 2008 \u2013 the bank was run by Fred Goodwin, who was stripped in January 2012 of the knighthood he was awarded 10 years earlier. Goodwin had no right of appeal, and in accordance with custom was given no right to make representations to the forfeiture committee, a group of four permanent secretaries. The Crown Office said its investigation had required co-operation from the Financial Conduct Authority - which replaced the FSA - the Prudential Regulation Authority, part of the Bank of England, as well as the Serious Fraud Office, the Financial Reporting Council and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. \u201cIf any further evidence comes to light which is relevant to this enquiry it will be considered by the Crown and we reserve the right to make further enquiry, if considered appropriate,\u201d the Crown Office said. RBS has not yet reported an annual profit since its bailout and has amassed more than \u00a350bn of losses in the eight years since taxpayers stepped in to stop its collapse. The government has also found it difficult to extricate itself from the bank, selling off a 5% stake in August for a \u00a31bn loss. Taxpayers still own 73% \u2013 and the shares are trading at 213p \u2013 below the 330p at which George Osborne sold shares in the summer and below the 502p average paid for the stake. RBS said: \u201cWe cooperated fully with this investigation and we note today\u2019s decision.\u201d The Insolvency Service has also ended its enquiries.",

The report found \u201cmultiple poor decisions\u201d caused the crisis that led to the \u00a345bn bailout.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.crownoffice.gov.uk/media-site-news-from-copfs/1310-update-investigation-into-rbs\">prosecutor said</a>: \u201cThe failure of RBS is an issue of great public concern..... The Crown\u2019s investigation focused on the rights issue of April \u2013 June 2008, and involved detailed consideration of whether there was any evidence of criminal conduct associated with the rights issue.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf there were such evidence those responsible would face prosecution. If not, the public in Scotland could be reassured that the matter had been properly investigated.</p> <p>\u201cFollowing careful examination of all the evidence seen to date, Crown Counsel have decided that there is insufficient evidence in law of criminal conduct either in relation to RBS as an institution or any directors or other senior management involved in the rights issue.\u201d</p> <p>At the time of the rights issue \u2013 the cash call on investors in 2008 \u2013 the bank was run by Fred Goodwin, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/31/fred-goodwin-stripped-of-knighthood\">was stripped in January 2012 of the knighthood he was awarded 10 years earlier</a>. Goodwin had no right of appeal, and in accordance with custom was given no right to make representations to the forfeiture committee, a group of four permanent secretaries.</p> <p>The Crown Office said its investigation had required co-operation from the Financial Conduct Authority - which replaced the FSA - the Prudential Regulation Authority, part of the Bank of England, as well as the Serious Fraud Office, the Financial Reporting Council and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p> <p>\u201cIf any further evidence comes to light which is relevant to this enquiry it will be considered by the Crown and we reserve the right to make further enquiry, if considered appropriate,\u201d the Crown Office said.<br></p> <p>RBS has not yet reported an annual profit since its bailout and has amassed more than \u00a350bn of losses in the eight years since taxpayers stepped in to stop its collapse. The government has also found it difficult to extricate itself from the bank, selling off a 5% stake<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/04/rbs-sell-off-george-osborne-defends-1bn-loss\"> in August for a \u00a31bn loss</a>. Taxpayers still own 73% \u2013 and the shares are trading at 213p \u2013 below the 330p at which George Osborne sold shares in the summer and below the 502p average paid for the stake. </p> <p>RBS said: \u201cWe cooperated fully with this investigation and we note today\u2019s decision.\u201d</p> <p>The Insolvency Service has also ended its enquiries.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nobody would have noticed anything odd had they been walking along the rear security wall of Buckingham Palace on 23 October 2008. Yet all around there were hidden eyes and ears trained on the activities taking place in a small office located on nearby Grosvenor Place. For a year, a team led by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) alongside colleagues from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), had been tracking a suspected insider trading ring as part of Operation Tabernula. While they had gleaned many fascinating details, they were flummoxed by some major questions. Despite receiving a series of suspicious transaction reports about the fabulously prescient share deals the targets had placed, the officers had no idea where the trader\u2019s information was coming from. Who was the inside source giving this trading ring the confidence to bet \u00a350,000 on each penny movement of shares in the brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle? Where had the \u00a34.4m of profits from that trade gone? But then, the Buckingham Palace stakeout produced the breakthrough. A bug planted in the office of a day trader called Ben Anderson \u2013 located barely 50 metres from the rear wall of the Queen\u2019s London residence \u2013 picked up on his conversation with Iraj Parvizi, a well known City trader who had risen to prominence after working in a Kent kebab shop. Parvizi was on a rare trip to the UK and the pair were discussing an individual who was \u201cworking at Deutsche Bank\u201d and had \u201cdone his bollocks. Financially. That\u2019s why he says he\u2019s hungry ... Because you know he worked for Morgan? \u2026 he went to Lehmans, he says he got fucked on Lehman\u2019s shares as well\u201d. While the pair did not name this insider, the subject of that conversation was referred to as \u201cHind\u2019s man\u201d. As the surveillance team observed Parvizi leaving Anderson\u2019s office, he climbed into a silver BMW sports utility that belonged to one Andrew Hind, a Manchester University maths graduate and accountant nicknamed \u201cNobu\u201d. He had worked at PwC and for Arcadia Group between 1997 and 1998. One of Hind\u2019s closest friends turned out to be a top City financier called Martyn Dodgson. Everything was now clearer. Dodgson had been a well known figure in the City since he had advised the government on its stakes in the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group taken as a result of the credit crunch. A graduate of Lancaster University with a first class degree in economics, he was a corporate broker at Deutsche Bank and had previously worked at Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers \u2013 meaning he was privy to large amounts of price-sensitive information about companies whose shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange. This stellar career was now effectively at an end. On Thursday Dodgson, 44, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years, after being convicted three days earlier at Southwark crown court of insider dealing, thus becoming perhaps London\u2019s highest-profile insider trader to date. Hind, 56, received three-and-a-half years for his role as the middleman. The previous longest sentence handed down for being convicted of insider dealing in the UK was four years given to Richard Joseph in 2013. Three other alleged participants were all acquitted, including Anderson, 71, and Parvizi, 50, as well as Andrew \u201cGrant\u201d Harrison, 46, who also worked in corporate broking and who was alleged to have played a similar role to Dodgson. Anderson and Parvizi admitted adding their own funds to investments carried out on behalf of Hind, but both insisted they had no reason to suspect his stock picks were based on price-sensitive insider information. In order to be convicted of insider dealing in the UK, the jury has to be satisfied that defendants were aware they were trading on inside information. When arrested six years ago, Dodgson, who was paid \u00a3601,000 a year as a managing director at Deutsche Bank, repeatedly denied to FSA officers that he was involved in personally trading shares. Yet the evidence they had gleaned suggested otherwise. On Dodgson\u2019s keyring investigators found the key for a red metal petty cash box, which had been discovered stashed under Dodgson\u2019s bed at his home in Hampstead, north London. Inside the box was a specialist encrypted storage drive called an IronKey, which its makers boast is \u201cmilitary grade\u201d. Dodgson said he had not used the device in years and could not unlock it. But by cross-checking other passwords the banker had used elsewhere, investigators were able to discover that the drive was opened by the password \u201cLamborghini55\u201d. The court was told the drive contained incriminating evidence including a spreadsheet that listed coded references to the trades. From these files investigators were able to match the trades to Dodgson, but the task was far from simple. The total cost of Operation Tabernula \u2013 which has also resulted in the convictions of three other men \u2013 came to almost \u00a314m. The joint investigation by the FSA and Soca was continued by the organisations that replaced them in 2013, the Financial Conduct Authority and the National Crime Agency. The effort involved about 40 staff at its peak, 485 applications under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act - the law governing the use of covert techniques by public authorities - plus analysis of more than 500,000 lines of telecoms data, 120 trading accounts and more than 600 digital devices, including pay-as-you-go mobile phones that were routinely discarded. Investigators also discovered Hind had bought six encrypted USB sticks, with three found in a wall safe at his home. When asked for the passwords, he declined to provide them. Investigators never found the key. So, like its owner, the data is locked away.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A London to Edinburgh rail service that promises to compete with budget airlines and Virgin Trains East Coast has been given the go-ahead. First Group will launch a rival operation, which is says will offer lower fares and an earlier arrival in the Scottish capital, from 2021 after the rail regulator granted it open-access rights on the east coast mainline. Stagecoach, which runs Virgin Trains as a joint venture with Sir Richard Branson \u2013 and expects to pay \u00a33.3bn in premiums up to 2023 after winning the East Coast franchise \u2013 had fought the application and criticised the decision. The regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), also approved Virgin Trains\u2019 plan to run new services on the line, calling at Harrogate, Lincoln and Middlesbrough, from 2019. However, a plan for fast trains travelling between London and Edinburgh in less than four hours \u2013 proposed by Alliance, the firm behind Grand Central \u2013 was turned down. First Group, which famously lost out to Virgin in the franchising fiasco to run the west coast mainline, has promised to undercut its rival with average fares of less than \u00a325, free Wi-Fi and on-board catering, in a single-class space inspired by budget airlines. Tim O\u2019Toole, First\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe will offer genuinely low fares at half the average price of today, while adding significant benefits to the UK economy.

      "bodyText": "Nissan has vowed to rebuild trust in Mitsubishi Motors after taking a one-third stake in the scandal-hit car-maker. The deal is a boost to Mitsubishi, which has been engulfed in crisis after admitting last month that it had faked data to overstate the fuel efficiency of more than 600,000 cars. Nissan will pay 237bn yen (\u00a31.5bn) for a 34% share, giving it a controlling stake in its smaller Japanese rival. Mitsubishi\u2019s share price has fallen about 40% since news of the scandal broke, as traders fearful of both financial and reputational damage rushed to dump the stock. Carlos Ghosn, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, said the company would work hard to restore Mitsubishi\u2019s reputation. Announcing the deal in Tokyo, he said: \u201cAt Nissan we are determined to preserve and nurture the Mitsubishi Motors brand. And we will help this company address the challenges it faces, particularly in restoring consumer trust in its fuel economy performance. \u201cNissan will also contribute to management expertise and corporate governance experience necessary to deliver sustainable and profitable growth \u2026 It is a potential win-win transaction.\u201d The two companies are already partners in development and manufacturing, but there was no cross-ownership involved. Mitsubishi falsified mileage test results on a number of models, including two it manufactured for Nissan, Japan\u2019s second largest car-maker after Toyota. Mitsubishi said at the time the cars affected were only sold in Japan. However, it said it would extend its investigation to cover cars made for overseas markets. Commenting on the deal, Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cTaking a big stake in Mitsubishi Motors is a risky move by Nissan when it\u2019s still not known how much the fuel economy scandal will cost in fines, litigation and lost business. \u201cFrom a straightforward valuation standpoint, with Mitsubishi Motors shares down over 40% since the scandal broke, Nissan can negotiate a bargain price.\u201d Under the terms of the deal, Mitsubishi will issue new shares to Nissan, at a 5.3% discount to Wednesday\u2019s close, raising 237bn yen.",

      "bodyText": "EDF, the French utility group lined up to build twin nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset, has said the cost of the project could be \u00a32.7bn higher than previously expected, at nearly \u00a321bn. In a statement before its annual general meeting, the state-controlled energy company said its ownership commitment on the project could rise from \u00a312bn to \u00a313.8bn. Its Chinese partner, CGN, could be liable for an extra \u00a3900m, taking its commitment to \u00a36.9bn. An EDF spokesman said the existing \u00a318bn estimate contained contingency planning for general cost overruns and that the extra \u00a32.7bn was to ensure the project was completed in the event of an extraordinary or catastrophic event. In its statement, EDF said: \u201cThe partners\u2019 equity commitment includes a contingency margin and could reach a total of \u00a313.8bn for the EDF group and \u00a36.9bn to CGN.\u201d EDF also indicated Hinkley Point could be completed later than the already delayed target of 2025. It predicted the project would take 115 months after a final investment decision was made. If, as suggested by the French economy minister, a decision comes in September, that would mean the earliest start date would be spring 2026. EDF said it would provide CGN with limited financial guarantees to cover cost overruns or delays to the project or if European authorities challenged the financial terms agreed with the UK government. EDF\u2019s chief executive, Jean-Bernard Levy, told the meeting in Paris that without Hinkley Point, EDF would not win nuclear power contracts in other countries. It has already racked up long delays for smaller projects in France and Finland. \u201cThis project is essential for the credibility of the entire French nuclear industry,\u201d he said. EDF agreed the main terms of a deal with the UK government and CGN, China\u2019s main nuclear operator, in October to build two reactors at Hinkley Point. The French group, whose finances are under pressure, said at the time it expected to take a final investment decision within weeks but it has yet to make a definitive commitment. The UK government has made the project a vital part of its energy plans despite longstanding doubts about its viability. Amber Rudd, the energy secretary, did not respond to a question in the House of Commons about the extra potential costs. Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace, accused EDF of not getting its facts straight. \u201cAll the evidence shows that EDF are completely willing to say whatever it takes to keep the UK and Chinese governments happy, but are seemingly unable to build a reactor that works on budget and on time.\u201d Alarm has grown inside EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, about the scale of its future financial commitments and debts at a time of plunging power prices and difficulties with other projects. Thomas Piquemal, EDF\u2019s finance director, quit in March after the company refused to postpone investment to deal with a range of problems. In Britain, Hinkley has attracted criticism from the City for being too costly for taxpayers. The government has promised to pay \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour for the power over 35 years \u2013 double the current cost. Ministers say the scheme, which could provide 7% of UK electricity, represents value for money in the long term and could help lower UK carbon emissions.",

      "bodyText": "Demand for gold soared at the start of the year, the strongest first quarter on record, the World Gold Council (WGC) has said. It predicted that negative interest rates, global uncertainty and a good monsoon season in India would bolster buying further in coming months. Demand surged 21% between January and March, as negative interest rates in Japan and Europe, which have led to rock-bottom savings rates, slower global growth and stock market turbulence drove investors to bullion, seen as the ultimate safe haven. The WGC\u2019s report [pdf] noted that China\u2019s devaluation of the yuan had fuelled fears over the country\u2019s economic health and the impact on the global economy, and that the pace of US interest rate rises was widely expected to slow. Inflows into exchange-traded funds, which track the spot price of gold, reached a seven-year high, close to levels last seen during the Great Recession when the sovereign debt crisis was in full swing. The dollar price of gold rose 17% during the first quarter \u2013 its best performance in almost three decades. Financial institutions were the main driver, but retail investors were also out in force, looking to gold to diversify their investments and protect their wealth. Buying by central banks dipped, however, and demand for jewellery fell due to the price rises and strikes in India. Demand by US investors jumped 55% in the first quarter from a year earlier and Europe remained one of the biggest markets for gold investments, powered by Germany. In China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of gold, demand grew by 5%, boosted by buying of bars and coins for Chinese New Year. Demand in India, the second-largest gold consumer, slumped 39% in response to the price rally but is expected to rise as much as 10% over the year as a whole. India\u2019s jewellery market virtually ground to a halt in March when jewellers reacted to government tax rises with widespread strikes. But a good monsoon season \u2013 with extra rain forecast between June and September \u2013 should boost farmers\u2019 earnings, which have been hurt by severe drought in recent months. Two-thirds of India\u2019s gold demand comes from villages, where jewellery is traditionally bought as an investment. Demand in the UK edged up 1%. Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault, the world\u2019s largest online gold exchange, said: \u201cQ1 looked very much like a crisis for the UK when viewed both through gold prices (+20% in GBP) and through gold demand \u2013 the strongest number of new UK users at BullionVault in three years. The urgency to buy gold has since eased back as sterling steadies on the foreign exchange market.\u201d Even so, interest remains strong, he said, with the number of new UK users on the exchange 22% higher so far this year, compared with the same period in 2015, and gold priced in sterling holding near two-and-a-half-year highs.",

      "bodyText": "TalkTalk profits more than halved following a cyber-attack in which the personal details of thousands of customers were hacked. The telecoms company was hit with \u00a342m in costs when almost 157,000 customers were affected by the attack in October last year. Almost one in 10 of those customers had their bank account numbers and sort codes accessed. Pre-tax profit fell to \u00a314m in the year to 31 March, from \u00a332m a year earlier. The share price was up just over 1% at 274p on Thursday afternoon. TalkTalk insisted it \u201crecovered strongly\u201d in the fourth quarter following the attack, after losing 95,000 customers in the third quarter as a direct result of the hacking. Dido Harding, its chief executive, said: \u201cThe business bounced back strongly in the final quarter following the cyber-attack in October. \u201cWe recorded our lowest ever churn and stabilised the broadband base, testimony to the speed with which customer sentiment towards TalkTalk has recovered, the success of our greater focus on existing customers, and the growing benefits of our simplification programme. \u201cWe take security incredibly seriously; we thought we took it very seriously before. We have brought forward spending on security.\u201d TalkTalk maintained its guidance for underlying earnings in the 2017 financial year of \u00a3320m-\u00a3360m. The board recommended a final dividend of 10.58p a share, taking the full-year dividend to 15.87p, up 15% compared with the previous year. Steve Clayton, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cTalkTalk had a torrid year, grabbing the headlines for all the wrong reasons after the cyber-attack that was initially thought to have seen significant amounts of customer data stolen, but which turned out to be of a far smaller scale than first feared. \u201c[The company is] sounding confident about the future, but at the same time, suggesting that profits will be low in the first half of the current financial year, with the money flooding in in the second half. \u201cThe shares have recovered well from the lows they reached after the cyber-attack. If TalkTalk can deliver on its cost savings plans, and continue to increase its quad-play customer base, then there could be an attractive level of income on offer ... but there is little margin for error, given the low level of dividend cover.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has extended its bet on Debenhams by a year and reiterated that it would be a supportive shareholder in the department store chain. The sportswear retailer, controlled by the billionaire Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley, agreed a so-called put-option deal with Goldman Sachs over a 10.5% stake in Debenhams in January 2015. On Thursday morning the company said the agreement had been extended by one year. The put-option is a bet that Debenhams\u2019 share price will rally. If the share price is below the agreed exercise price when the contract expires, Sports Direct would have to buy the stake \u2013 the equivalent of 128.9m shares \u2013 at that price or pay the bank the difference. If the share price rises above the exercise price, Sports Direct receives the premium \u2013 a profit for Ashley and the company. Sports Direct previously said its maximum exposure under the put-option was about \u00a385m. Buying put-options is a way of gaining access to a sizeable stake in a company without tying up capital. The retailer said: \u201cSports Direct reiterates its intention to be a supportive stakeholder in Debenhams and to create value in the interests of both Sports Direct\u2019s and Debenhams\u2019 shareholders.\u201d Debenhams\u2019 share price rose slightly to 74.4p, from 73.35p on 23 January 2015 when the put-option deal was first announced. The agreement is Sports Direct\u2019s only remaining put-option that relates to shares in other listed companies, it said. The group had set up a similar deal over Tesco shares.",

      "body": "<p>Sports Direct has extended its bet on Debenhams by a year and reiterated that it would be a supportive shareholder in the department store chain.</p> <p>The sportswear retailer, controlled by the billionaire Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/23/sports-direct-owner-mike-ashley-debenhams\">agreed a so-called put-option deal with Goldman Sachs</a> over a 10.5% stake in Debenhams in January 2015. On Thursday morning the company said the agreement had been extended by one year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/01/mike-ashley-says-he-is-working-on-bid-for-bhs\">Mike Ashley says he is working on bid for BHS</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The put-option is a bet that Debenhams\u2019 share price will rally. If the share price is below the agreed exercise price when the contract expires, Sports Direct would have to buy the stake \u2013 the equivalent of 128.9m shares \u2013 at that price or pay the bank the difference. If the share price rises above the exercise price, Sports Direct receives the premium \u2013 a profit for Ashley and the company.</p> <p>Sports Direct previously said its maximum exposure under the put-option was about \u00a385m. Buying put-options is a way of gaining access to a sizeable stake in a company without tying up capital.</p> <p>The retailer said: \u201cSports Direct reiterates its intention to be a supportive stakeholder in Debenhams and to create value in the interests of both Sports Direct\u2019s and Debenhams\u2019 shareholders.\u201d</p> <p>Debenhams\u2019 share price rose slightly to 74.4p, from 73.35p on 23 January 2015 when the put-option deal was first announced.</p> <p>The agreement is Sports Direct\u2019s only remaining put-option that relates to shares in other listed companies, it said. The group had set up a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/25/sports-direct-mike-ashley-43m-punt-tesco-shares\">similar deal over Tesco shares</a>.</p>",
