      "bodyText": "The year has ended well for the treasurer. The latest job numbers out this week show that employment growth remains strong and Monday\u2019s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) is likely to show a smaller deficit than was projected in the May budget. But amid that good news is a notable indicator of the problem that has cast a pall over all the economic news this year. The Myefo is essentially the last major economic news for the year. There isn\u2019t any more big data to arrive from the ABS (which, like the rest of the public service, will shut down between Christmas and New Year). And even the Myefo is not expected to be altogether surprising. There have been reports about new cuts to university funding, but the big picture is mostly known, and it is mostly good news for the government. The likelihood is the Myefo will reveal that the 2017-18 budget will come in with a significantly smaller deficit than was predicted in May. The latest monthly figures from the Department of Finance show that in the first four months of this financial year the government received $3.2bn more tax revenue than expected and spent $870m less than predicted in the May budget. So right now the budget for 2017-18 has a $3.5bn smaller deficit than expected. If those revenue figures continue to outperform expectations for the next eight months, then the surplus is going to be rather smaller than the $29.4bn forecast in May. What is driving that extra revenue, however, highlights the fractured nature of the economic growth we have experienced this year. There is no doubting that employment growth has been superb this year. Off the back of major public infrastructure programs and the healthcare and social assistance industry, employment has now been growing for 14 months straight \u2013 the best run since the early 1990s. Even better is that full-time employment is also growing well. At the start of this year the number of people working full-time was actually lower than it was at the start of 2015. Since then, 296,000 more people have begun working full-time \u2013 a 3.8% annual increase that is as good as we\u2019ve seen for nearly 30 years. You have to go back to 1989 to find annual full-time employment growth faster than we are currently experiencing. And even if you are churlish and suggest this year is just making up for last year\u2019s horror run, the past two years still had the strongest full-time employment growth since 2011-12. So all good news. And yet, when you look at the government\u2019s financial updates, the big improvement in tax revenue does not come from income tax, even though the May budget predicted employment would only grow by just 1.5%, whereas it is currently running at 3.1%. The amount of individual income tax the government has received this financial year is actually a touch over $800m less than expected. This is because although the government predicted weaker employment growth than is currently occurring, it also predicted stronger wage growth. The May budget hoped that wages would grow in 2017-18 at 2.5%, whereas they are rising by just 2.0%. So what has delivered the bonanza of tax revenue? Companies. Thus far the government has received $3.7bn more company tax revenue than they were hoping \u2013 19% above that predicted in the May budget. So big has been this tax bonanza driven by rising coal and iron ore prices that if it were to hold, the government is looking at an extra $14.7bn in revenue over the course of 2017-18. Now that is very unlikely to happen, but it gives you a sense of just how much of a revenue boom there has been. So company profits up by more than expected has led to better company tax revenue, but workers, despite more people working than expected, are delivering lower income tax revenue than anticipated. That is an apt result given the biggest economic story of the year was the decision by the Fair Work Commission to cut penalty rates on weekends for retail, pharmacy, fast food and hospitality industries. The drive of economic policy this year has all been towards stronger company profits and the hope of higher wages to come, while at the same time policy levers have been geared towards keeping wages low \u2013 whether it be through inaction on penalty rates or move to limit the ability of unions to effectively negotiate for higher wages. It highlights the issue the Governor of the Reserve Bank has noted that \u201cthe normal tendency for firms to pay higher wages in tight labour markets appears to be muted\u201d, because \u201cbusinesses are not bidding up wages in the way they might once have\u201d. At least here there might be some better news ahead. One issue has been that although unemployment has been falling, underemployment had been rising throughout the year. But the November labour force figures showed that the underemployment rate had fallen from 8.6% to 8.4% \u2013 a move that should see wages growth improve a touch. That is at least the theory, and it will be watched closely. This year has been all about companies and investment and the recovery in the jobs market. Next year will be all about whether or not this foundation leads to strong wages and household incomes growth. If it does, the prospects for an early election will rise; if it doesn\u2019t, expect industrial relations to be a major political battleground for whenever the government chooses to go to the polls.",

In the trade it is known as New York- dressed, which means it is dry-plucked and then left to hang with head, feet and guts intact. \u201cIt allows the bird to mature and develop extra flavour,\u201d the butcher explains. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it for the taste, which is exactly the opposite of mass-produced, factory-produced turkeys sold by the supermarkets.\u201d Lishman is one of thousands of independent local retailers up and down the UK relying on the annual pre-Christmas trade to help them survive against increasingly stiff competition from supermarkets and internet providers. This year Lishman \u2013 owner of Lishman\u2019s butchers in the West Yorkshire town of Ilkley \u2013 can perhaps be buoyed by figures that suggest more shoppers plan to head to their local high street for their Christmas food. Research for the digital marketing agency Wunderman, conducted by YouGov, found that half of the 2,000 British shoppers surveyed will shop at places they don\u2019t usually do so for Christmas, that they are planning to steer clear of online retailers and that the biggest winners will be independent butchers and fishmongers. These were followed by Christmas markets, independent bakers and farm shops. The findings will be well received in Ilkley where, over three decades, eight local butchers have dwindled to three \u2013 including Lishman\u2019s \u2013 since the arrival of most of the major supermarkets. \u201cLet\u2019s say we have had to change our sails to accommodate the wind,\u201d says Lishman, who is national vice-chairman of the Q Guild of butchers, a group of more than 120 of the finest-quality independent meat retailers in Britain. \u201cWe can\u2019t compete with the supermarkets with their fancy, expensive brochures and advertising, but we do offer top quality and value for money.\u201d He continues: \u201cChristmas is hugely important to us commercially and the two weeks before it account for 10% of our total turnover. We do have customers that only come at Christmas but we are delighted to see them [rather] than not at all.\u201d Danny Lidgate owns C Lidgate, a butchers in Notting Hill Gate, west London. He admits he is disappointed when shoppers visit only for their Christmas meats but says: \u201cThe general retail trade is tough. We would encourage consumers to get to know their butcher, as they are a wealth of advice and can even help you save money.\u201d Charles Clewlow of H Clewlow Butchers in Nantwich, Cheshire, says that at Christmas he sells a lot of beef rib and pork, as well as turkey. \u201cWe find people bring in their recipes and ask for a cut to be prepared in a certain way. This service isn\u2019t something you get outside of a butcher\u2019s shop.\u201d Hundreds of miles away in Devon, Nick Legg of the Fish Deli in Ashburton is preparing for what he describes as \u201ca week of madness\u201d as locals stock up with fish and shellfish for their Christmas feast. \u201cWe have good year-round trade,\u201d he says, \u201cand then I see a lot of people at Christmas I wouldn\u2019t normally see, who might be feeling a bit guilty.\u201d He is expecting to sell high volumes of RSPCA Assured salmon, fresh lobster from Cornwall and native oysters from Falmouth or Colchester \u2013 along with fish-pie mix, \u201cloads of smoked salmon\u201d and scallops, turbot and sea bass for the Christmas centrepiece. Shoppers who don\u2019t have a local greengrocer can support independent vegetable growers by opting for a box delivery service, from suppliers such as Abel &amp; Cole. It reports that 3,000 new customers have placed a Christmas order this year. \u201cOne of the things our customers love is that we wholeheartedly support small suppliers and producers and help them reach a broader market,\u201d says Hannah Shipton, managing director of Abel &amp; Cole. \u201cThis year, our Christmas range is made up of 45 of our suppliers.\u201d Pip Hulbert, the chief executive of Wunderman UK, which put together the festive retail report, says that people turn to local shops at Christmas when they are prepared to spend a bit more on the best food and drink they can find. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that specialist shops, like butchers and bakers, are a popular choice when shoppers have told us that a major gripe at this time of the year is poor customer service.\u201d Hulbert believes that supermarkets could learn a lot from specialist retailers. \u201cOur research revealed that the biggest improvements shoppers want to see are for stores to recruit more staff, to provide an online stock checker and to offer more information about seasonal services.\u201d Back in Ilkley, Lishman is expecting to sell 300-400 whole turkeys over the Christmas period, though crowns and boneless breasts that need no carving are now more popular. \u201cCustomers want short cuts and convenience, so now we make everything from the pigs in blankets through to ready-made stuffing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe do all that and we do it very well.\u201d",

The process of reorganisation in a digital age, however, has been painful. It has been three years since a major new shopping mall opened in the US, leading some operators to speculate that the last one has already been built. According to Bloomberg, more than 10% of US retail space, or nearly 1bn square feet, may need to be closed, converted to other uses, or renegotiated. Nearly 9,000 stores are estimated to close in 2017, a third more than during the crash of 2008. The rapid collapse of bricks-and-mortar retail has left mall owners and retail property owners on main street USA in a Darwinian struggle to think up new ways to fill retail space and keep consumers coming. Malls are confronting erosion on two fronts: retailers are looking for better control of their brands, and to reduce their exposure to bricks-and-mortar retailing. More than 300 retailers have filed for bankruptcy so far this year, up 31% from last year. In addition, brands like Nike, Canada Goose and Michael Kors are fleeing mass-market department stores, typically the anchor tenants of major US malls. In October, Nike chief executive Mark Parker announced that out of Nike\u2019s global universe of more than 30,000 retail partners, the company would now focus on just 40 \u201cstrategic wholesale partners\u201d. Mass-market retail spaces, explains the Business of Fashion, \u201chave increasingly become like kryptonite. In a world constantly seeking what\u2019s next, new or special, mass retail has become toxic in its overexposure.\u201d Mall owners have recognised that they had become too dependent on clothing. According to Louis Conforti, the chief executive of mall operator Washington Prime, more than 40% of merchants were selling junior fashion and accessories. \u201cUnless four out of 10 of my customers are wearing a midriff T-shirt, this has been a reactive and lazy industry,\u201d Conforti told the Observer. Mall operators, Conforti says, are now more aggressive in their effort to introduce more food and beverage outlets and more home furnishings and home goods retailers. The drive includes tie-ins and \u201creal-time incentives\u201d, including fashion shows or selling the wares from a local craft brewery, and tie-ins with e-commerce platforms. \u201cWe need to create common area installations that benefit existing tenants. We need a lot more eventing. The idea that common areas are relegated to kiosks is over. We could have club chairs [armchairs] and artisanal sandwiches, and it\u2019ll be a different thing if you\u2019re in Sacramento or in Kansas City.\u201d Another part of the drive is to partner with e-commerce, including Amazon. As the e-commerce giant begins developing its own line of physical stores, mall operators are optimistic that the two will ultimately combine, creating a class of \u201cexperiential merchants\u201d using bricks-and-mortar and online assets to create a new, more personalised consumer experience. \u201cWhoever doesn\u2019t realise that there is a symbiotic relationship between e-commerce and physical space is moronic, and playing the ostrich does no good for anybody,\u201d says Conforti.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Apple\u2019s acquisition of music-recognition app Shazam, for a reported $400m (\u00a3300m), is just the latest in a string of major acquisitions of British technology companies by overseas suitors. The purchase is Apple\u2019s biggest since 2014, when it spent $3bn on headphone manufacturer Beats Electronics, and is one of the largest acquisitions this year for the British tech sector. It follows the sale of Imagination Technologies, which makes the graphics processors used in iPhones and iPads, to a Chinese private equity firm for $550m (\u00a3412m) in September. Both purchases pale in comparison to a pair of acquisitions made in 2016, however. Flight comparison site Skyscanner sold itself to Chinese tourism group Ctrip for \u00a31.4bn in November of that year, while shortly after the EU referendum, the chip designer ARM accepted a \u00a324.3bn offer from Japanese group SoftBank. The ARM deal, announced just weeks after the UK voted to leave the EU, was the second-largest foreign takeover of a UK-listed company ever, behind only ABInBev\u2019s deal to buy SABMiller. That acquisition also serves as a counter to one popular explanation for the spate of buyouts: that it\u2019s simply a function of the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Yes, the pound plummeted against the yen after the referendum \u2013 but ARM\u2019s share price rose by a corresponding 17%, as the company makes most of its revenue in dollars. That meant that the actual price SoftBank paid for ARM rose in the weeks following the referendum. More generally, big mergers and acquisitions are often laid in place far too far in advance for the vagaries of the foreign exchange market to affect them, says Paul Hollingsworth, the senior UK economist at Capital Economics. \u201cWhether we\u2019re seeing any sort of Brexit or pound effect, it\u2019s a bit too soon \u2013 it\u2019s really going to be a couple of years before any effect appears.\u201d Sriram Prakash, the lead for innovation M&amp;A at Deloitte, agrees. \u201cFirst and foremost, in any M&amp;A transaction you buy a company not because it\u2019s cheap, but because it\u2019s good. And then, it might be cheap because of currency devaluations or whatever, and that might add to the speediness [and attractiveness] of the transaction, but the fundamentals are important.\u201d For British firms, then, it\u2019s all about the fundamentals. Those making the headlines for the size of their valuation aren\u2019t acquired for the revenue they bring in, or the size of their existing customer base, but for their world-leading grasp of basic technologies, says Priya Guha, the general manager of startup accelerator RocketSpace. \u201cWhat it comes down to is the UK strength in deep tech,\u201d Guha says. \u201cThe UK still has some of the most amazing academic research coming out of its universities. And that is being commercialised at a rate that much higher than elsewhere in the EU and getting close to what happens in the States.\u201d \u201cSo what that means is you have some of the most groundbreaking new technologies being developed right here in the UK. And yes, of course, that becomes a very appealing target for US companies who need that technology to be able to scale or just own a new direction for their own business.\u201d Perhaps the poster child for that sort of acquisition is DeepMind, acquired by Google in 2014 for $650m: the company, co-founded by UCL researcher Shane Legg, with Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman, retains strong links to the London university today. Even more emblematic of how a strong research background enables Britain to punch above its weight is Twitter\u2019s acquisition in June 2016 of machine learning-based image and video compression firm Magic Pony Technology. The company had just 11 staff at the time, and while its core technology was already wowing investors, it had no revenue, nor a plan of how to get any. Yet it was acquired for $150m and now forms the core of Twitter\u2019s machine-learning project, Cortex. While such a string of acquisitions certainly represents a massive inward flow of cash to Britain, it could have its downsides. If Britain\u2019s most promising startups always pick guaranteed cash now, over the prospect of a much bigger payoff later, then the nation will never have its own tech giants to rival Apple, Google and Facebook. Take Snapchat: it could have accepted Facebook\u2019s $3bn offer in 2013, but chose to reject it and try to build something that could become a Facebook competitor, not simply a department within the firm. Even now, after a rocky year following its initial public offering, the company is worth almost $20bn. Is Britain doing itself out of the chance to lead the world? Guha thinks not. \u201cNo one would suggest that DeepMind has lessened its global impact by being part of Google,\u201d she notes. \u201cDespite being part of the bigger Alphabet machine, DeepMind is renowned in its own right across the world.\u201d And, she adds, if there is going to be a UK rival to the US giants, \u201cit was not going to be Shazam. For others in the market, M&amp;A can be a really good outcome.\u201d Prakash says he is \u201cempathetic to both sides. On one hand, every country needs a strong tech scene, and today Britain\u2019s looks a bit fragile if you note the amount of tech companies in the FTSE 100 and 250. But these companies cater for global markets. To be global you have to be acquired, or see whether you can scale up to that level yourself. If you can\u2019t, what are your options?\u201d Perhaps those who hope British companies would hold out a bit longer before being acquired should be careful what they wish for. Depending on how Brexit progresses, there is the potential for many of Britain\u2019s strengths, from its world-leading universities to an immigration system that is comparatively open to skilled migrants, to be erased. \u201cClearly,\u201d says Hollingsworth, \u201cthe pound\u2019s drop makes it a more attractive proposition to buy UK companies, but you have to weigh that against the domestic political uncertainty.\u201d",

Those making the headlines for the size of their valuation aren\u2019t acquired for the revenue they bring in, or the size of their existing customer base, but for their world-leading grasp of basic technologies, says Priya Guha, the general manager of <a href=\"https://www.rocketspace.com\">startup accelerator RocketSpace</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0626578e8139620b41bbddfd1f191b7422f9b2e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0626578e8139620b41bbddfd1f191b7422f9b2e6/0_331_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ARM Holdings logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japan\u2019s SoftBank paid \u00a324.3bn for ARM in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ARM Holdings/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat it comes down to is the UK strength in deep tech,\u201d Guha says. \u201cThe UK still has some of the most amazing academic research coming out of its universities. And that is being commercialised at a rate that much higher than elsewhere in the EU and getting close to what happens in the States.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what that means is you have some of the most groundbreaking new technologies being developed right here in the UK. And yes, of course, that becomes a very appealing target for US companies who need that technology to be able to scale or just own a new direction for their own business.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the poster child for that sort of acquisition is DeepMind, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/google-acquires-uk-artificial-intelligence-startup-deepmind\">acquired by Google in 2014 for $650m</a>: the company, co-founded by UCL researcher Shane Legg, with Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman, retains strong links to the London university today.</p> <p>Even more emblematic of how a strong research background enables Britain to punch above its weight <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/20/twitter-ai-magic-pony-150m-video\">is Twitter\u2019s acquisition in June 2016</a> of machine learning-based image and video compression firm Magic Pony Technology. The company had just 11 staff at the time, and while its core technology was already wowing investors, it had no revenue, nor a plan of how to get any. Yet it was acquired for $150m and now forms the core of <a href=\"https://cortex.twitter.com\">Twitter\u2019s machine-learning project, Cortex</a>.</p> <p>While such a string of acquisitions certainly represents a massive inward flow of cash to Britain, it could have its downsides. If Britain\u2019s most promising startups always pick guaranteed cash now, over the prospect of a much bigger payoff later, then the nation will never have its own tech giants to rival Apple, Google and Facebook.</p> <p>Take Snapchat: it could have accepted Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/13/snapchat-facebook-buyout-offer-rejected\">$3bn offer in 2013</a>, but chose to reject it and try to build something that could become a Facebook competitor, not simply a department within the firm. Even now, after a rocky year following its initial public offering, the company is worth almost $20bn. Is Britain doing itself out of the chance to lead the world?</p> <p>Guha thinks not. \u201cNo one would suggest that DeepMind has lessened its global impact by being part of Google,\u201d she notes. \u201cDespite being part of the bigger Alphabet machine, DeepMind is renowned in its own right across the world.\u201d And, she adds, if there is going to be a UK rival to the US giants, \u201cit was not going to be Shazam. For others in the market, M&amp;A can be a really good outcome.\u201d</p> <p>Prakash says he is \u201cempathetic to both sides. On one hand, every country needs a strong tech scene, and today Britain\u2019s looks a bit fragile if you note the amount of tech companies in the FTSE 100 and 250. But these companies cater for global markets. To be global you have to be acquired, or see whether you can scale up to that level yourself. If you can\u2019t, what are your options?\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps those who hope British companies would hold out a bit longer before being acquired should be careful what they wish for. Depending on how Brexit progresses, there is the potential for many of Britain\u2019s strengths, from its world-leading universities to an immigration system that is comparatively open to skilled migrants, to be erased.</p> <p>\u201cClearly,\u201d says Hollingsworth, \u201cthe pound\u2019s drop makes it a more attractive proposition to buy UK companies, but you have to weigh that against the domestic political uncertainty.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "With Christmas just eight days away, more than 200,000 shoppers will brave the crowds to trawl Westfield London\u2019s 300-plus stores for gifts this weekend. The gleaming centre, which lights up the west London skyline, is one of the \u201csupermalls\u201d that now tower over the UK retail sector, pulling in millions of shoppers thanks to a magnetic mix of high street and luxury brands, as well as more upmarket restaurants and cinema screens than your average town centre. Yet, as if Westfield London\u2019s current near-two-mile run of shops were not enough to exhaust even the most energetic Christmas shopper, visitors can see the shell of a \u00a3600m extension that, come spring, will turn it into Europe\u2019s biggest mall, with John Lewis and Primark among the new arrivals unveiling branches next year. However, the new wing looks like madness in the current economic climate. British households are facing the biggest squeeze on living standards since records began, while the trend for online shopping is prompting many retailers to close, rather than open, stores. This tough environment is what sowed the seeds for this month\u2019s game of shopping-centre Top Trumps, with two blockbuster deals announced within days of each other. British property group Hammerson said it was buying smaller rival Intu for \u00a33.4bn, then Australian billionaire Sir Frank Lowy pulled a rabbit out of the hat by agreeing to sell his family\u2019s Westfield shopping centre empire, including its two London malls, to France\u2019s Unibail-Rodamco for \u00a319bn. \u201cThere are so many things going on in the world of property at the moment, but with these deals we are seeing them all collide,\u201d said James Findlater, head of shopping centre investment at Colliers International. \u201cThere is a structural change because of the shift to online, but also macro issues \u2013 notably consumers\u2019 ability to spend when they haven\u2019t had a pay rise for 10 years. \u201cThere is probably 30% too much retail, and it is still being built.\u201d Findlater says owners of older shopping centres are struggling to attract retailers, who are more interested in being in the country\u2019s top-tier malls such as Westfield: \u201cOutside of the core dominant shopping centres, there have been deals done post-recession where retailers are paying no rent. Landlords don\u2019t want to be saddled with covering occupancy costs on vacant stores.\u201d There are around 550 shopping centres in the UK; and while 10 years ago retailers would have had to open 250 stores to cover the country, these days that figure is just 100 plus a website. In this climate, the strongest shopping malls have more power, creating a huge headache for the owners of centres in secondary locations, who are facing a vicious circle of decline. Intu\u2019s chairman, John Strachan, hailed the company\u2019s takeover as the \u201cmost significant transaction in British real estate in a generation\u201d, while Hammerson boss David Atkins said that, in a changing retail market, only centres with a \u201csensational brand mix and leisure offer\u201d would succeed. Leisure has become an increasingly important part of the shopping-centre experience, as families spend the day shopping, eating and then heading to the cinema or bowling alley, all under one roof. Last year, Westfield went as far as hiring Grammy-, Tony- and Emmy-winning theatre and film producer Scott Sanders to create spectacular events incorporating theatre, music, dance, food and fashion in its centres. Both Hammerson and Intu have worked hard to pull in shoppers in a digital age, developing their websites and enhancing their centres with wifi and apps to make it easier for shoppers to get what they want. But the shares of property companies have been hit by investor concerns that the market has peaked and that they can no longer bank on rising asset values. Hammerson is paying 253.9p per share for Intu, which is a third less than the value of its centres. By comparison Intu rejected a 425p per share bid in 2010, claiming it was worth more. Analysts say the numbers reflect a new reality as optimistic centre valuations, arrived at in good times, are questioned. The deal will give Hammerson a stake in 12 of the UK\u2019s 20 supermalls \u2013 those bigger than 20 million sq ft in size and attracting more than 20 million visitors a year \u2013 including Birmingham Bullring, Intu Trafford and Manchester Arndale. While smaller shopping centres and high streets are suffering, spending in British supermalls is expected to increase 7.2% over the next five years to \u00a312.3bn, according to analysts at GlobalData. Atkins indicated the combined group would look to sell \u00a32bn worth of its UK properties and save \u00a325m in running costs by pooling head offices and procurement of services like cleaning and security. While Intu owns more centres in the UK top 10 than Hammerson, others within its portfolio, such as those in Uxbridge and Nottingham\u2019s Broadmarsh, score much worse in industry league tables and are expected to be on the list of disposals. \u201cIntu own some dreadful assets that have fallen foul of changing shopper patterns,\u201d said one source, who suggested the timing of the deal was good for Intu as weakening consumer confidence pointed to a tough 2018 for retailers, many of whom are looking to exit their least profitable stores. The source claimed Intu had bolstered occupancy levels in struggling centres by letting stores on a temporary basis. Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams and Toys R Us are among the chains who have announced plans to close branches, while many former BHS premises remain empty. There is also speculation in property circles that big high street names such as House of Fraser could be among retailers considering a company voluntary arrangement \u2013 an insolvency procedure used by retailers to reduce their rent liabilities or close stores. The Hammerson-Intu marriage, which has more significance for the UK, was upstaged by the sale of Westfield to Unibail-Rodamco, the European group whose centres include owns Forum des Halles in Paris. One property source described the Westfield deal as being in a different stratosphere, as the company\u2019s only exposure to the struggling UK retail market is in London \u2013 where its centres in Stratford and Shepherd\u2019s Bush rank in the country\u2019s top three. The decision to expand the Westfield London site with more stores and more leisure venues, including Ichiba, Europe\u2019s largest Japanese food hall, and a boutique bowling venue, looks bold in the current climate. But from its position at the top of the tree, Westfield knows it is giving shoppers what they want.",

    "webTitle": "Turnbull takes credit for jobs surge, but groundwork was laid years ago", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Economists say it has been a stellar year for Australia\u2019s labour market, with a near-record 383,000 jobs created. Malcolm Turnbull has taken credit for the job surge, saying the Coalition\u2019s policies have restored confidence to business, and business has responded by \u201chiring more workers\u201d. But where have the jobs come from? According to JP Morgan economist, Tom Kennedy, nearly two-thirds of the new jobs have come from two industries \u2013 healthcare and social assistance (130,000 jobs), and construction (104,000 jobs) \u2013 and the policy groundwork for those jobs was laid a few years ago. Healthcare and social assistance In the past year, healthcare has accounted for more than 35% of economy-wide employment growth, despite the sector comprising just 13% of employment. Kennedy says much of the acceleration in employment and participation in the sector is the result of hiring and participation spillovers related to the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The NDIS was introduced in 2013 by the Gillard Labor government, and after a lengthy pilot program, began national roll out in July 2016. The exact effect of the NDIS on employment growth has been hard to calibrate, Kennedy says, but its influence became \u201cpronounced\u201d from 2015, with the pattern of rising healthcare jobs in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland matching the uneven roll-out of the NDIS. Kennedy says it is clear the rollout has had a noticeable impact on female participation, since the healthcare and social assistance sector is so female-dominated. Bureau of Statistics figures show the female participation rate jumped 1.5 percentage points in the last three years \u2013 it\u2019s now at a record-high 60.2%. Kennedy posits that since an increasing number of NDIS providers are taking some of the care load, it has allowed informal care-givers who had previously left the labour force to care for family members to re-enter the labour force to look for paid employment. \u201cIt is hard to be precise on labour supply implications, but there are more than 2.5 million informal care-givers in Australia, the bulk of whom are women, so it is likely the introduction of the NDIS has been influential in driving female participation higher,\u201d Kennedy told clients recently. \u201cIndeed the NDIS Agency reports data on participation of the family members of its participants, which does show some increase under the scheme. Of course, the employment impact of the labour supply that is released will be measured across all sectors, not just healthcare.\u201d Construction Economists say the construction industry has been the other noticeable job creator in the past 12 months, thanks to home-building and government infrastructure cycles. Commonwealth Bank economist Kristina Clifton says public infrastructure spending as a share of GDP has been rising at both state and federal levels, while the so-called \u201cconstruction rotation\u201d has been picking up steam. \u201cAs a share of GDP, total state infrastructure spending has been trending higher since early 2016, with a particularly strong lift in the second quarter of 2017 as a major hospital in South Australia was completed and transferred to public ownership,\u201d she wrote in a note to clients recently. \u201cSpending has been rising in all states with Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania the standouts. Infrastructure spending at the federal level has also been inching higher. Together the state and federal budgets imply an $8.1bn lift in capital expenditure in 2017-18.\u201d Clifton says the transport was a key feature of the 2017-18 federal budget, including $75bn in transport infrastructure over the next 10 years. \u201cThis is significantly higher than the $10.3bn of transport spending in the previous 10 years.\u201d She said the decline in output and employment from the residential construction downturn was more than offset by the impacts of higher residential alterations and additions, non\u2011residential building work and public infrastructure construction activity. \u201cOn a net basis the construction rotation will add around 62,500 new jobs over 2017-18 and 2018-19,\u201d she said.",

Of course, the employment impact of the labour supply that is released will be measured across all sectors, not just healthcare.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Construction</strong></h2> <p>Economists say the construction industry has been the other noticeable job creator in the past 12 months, thanks to home-building and government infrastructure cycles.</p> <p>Commonwealth Bank economist Kristina Clifton says public infrastructure spending as a share of GDP has been <a href=\"https://www.commbank.com.au/content/dam/commbank/corporate/research/publications/economics/economic-issues/australia/2017/241017-Infrastructure_update.pdf\">rising at both state and federal levels</a>, while the so-called \u201cconstruction rotation\u201d has been picking up steam.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/dec/14/will-the-end-of-the-housing-boom-come-with-a-bang-or-a-wimper\">Will the end of the housing boom come with a bang or a whimper? | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAs a share of GDP, total state infrastructure spending has been trending higher since early 2016, with a particularly strong lift in the second quarter of 2017 as a major hospital in South Australia was completed and transferred to public ownership,\u201d she wrote in a note to clients recently.</p> <p>\u201cSpending has been rising in all states with Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania the standouts.
