      "bodyText": "Serco, a leading private contractor of public services, is failing to meet legal requirements to provide enough staff, train them properly or monitor their performance in the out-of-hours GP service it runs for the NHS in Cornwall. The company has been given 14 days by the health regulator, the Care Quality Commission, to come up with a plan to right the failures, which are highlighted in a damning report on Serco's operation in the south-west. The CQC judgment comes as the role of private contractors is under renewed scrutiny following G4S's failure to recruit enough security staff for the Olympics, and as large numbers of NHS contracts are being put out to tender. A Guardian investigation in May uncovered a string of serious allegations over Serco's service in Cornwall, made by whistleblowers who said the service was repeatedly so short-staffed as to compromise patient safety and who claimed Serco management manipulated data to suggest it met targets it had in fact failed to meet. Serco acknowledged that it had not met legal standards at the time of the CQC inspection but said it had already made progress in correcting shortcomings. \"We are confident that we will be able to fully satisfy the CQC that we are meeting all of the standards required when they next visit the service,\" it said.

      "body": "<p>In the three weeks since Barclays was hit with record \u00a3290m fines for attempting to manipulate the Libor price, eight top bankers and regulators have appeared before the Treasury select committee of MPs to face around 12 hours of questioning.</p> <p>The hearings culminated on Tuesday with Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King explaining the role he had in ousting Bob Diamond as chief executive of Barclays. King was accompanied by Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, and Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the two top candidates to replace him next June.</p> <p><strong>What has been learnt so far? </strong></p> <p>\u2022 There were two phases to the scandal. The period 2005-07 when Barclays was deliberately manipulating its submissions to Libor to benefit its own traders or clients; and 2007-09, during the banking crisis, when Barclays was cutting its submissions to Libor because of thefor fear that a high rate could indicate a bank in financial trouble.</p> <p>\u2022 Regulators in New York and London knew something was not right with Libor during the 2008 banking crisis. A Barclays trader even told the Federal Reserve bank of New York in 2007 of his suspicions that some submissions were too low. But the regulators focused more on the practicalities of setting Libor rather than any idea that there might besuggestions of attempts to deliberatelymanipulate the rate. King, who insisted he did not know about attempts to alter the rate until the Barclays fine was announced, told MPs: \"Concerns about what Libor meant is a million miles away from deliberate, deceitful manipulation of submissions in order to make financial gain.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Barclays was not alone. Tracey McDermott, acting head of enforcement at the FSA, revealed on Monday that seven other financial services companies \u2013 not just banks and not all British \u2013 are being investigated for potential attempts to manipulate interest rates. Regulators in the EU, US, Switzerland and Japan are also investigating.</p> <p>\u2022 Barclays had a very difficult relationship with the FSA. Andrew Bailey, the FSA's top regulator, accused the bank of a \"culture of gaming \u2013 and gaming us\", when he appeared before MPs. King said the Barclays board was \"in denial\" over the regulators' concerns about the bank. Regulators used public reaction to the Libor scandal to force out Diamond as chief executive. King told MPs: \"It is possible to sail close to the wind once, maybe twice or \u2026 three times \u2013 [but after] four or five times you do have to ask questions about the navigational skills of the captain on the bridge.\"</p> <p>\u2022 The regulators botched their message to the Barclays board about their concerns. On the third day after the fine was announced, Turner met Marcus Agius, the Barclays chairman, and the FSA chairman felt he was making it clear that Diamond needed to go. Agius did not mention this meeting when he appeared before MPs, instead saying that on the Friday he met Turner, the bank's shareholders were making it clear they did not want Diamond to go. On Saturday Agius decided to quit, a move interpreted as an attempt to save Diamond. King and Turner were shocked when they read about Agius's departure on the Sunday. One day later King summoned Agius - and the most senior non-executive director, Sir Michael Rake - to tell them Diamond had lost the confidence of the regulators. Agius was \"shocked\" and reinstated himself as executive chairman so Diamond could go. However, Agius will leave once a successor is found. Diamond never failed a \"fit and proper test\" that might ordinarily have been used to remove him from his post.</p> <p>\u2022 Tucker was involved in discussions about Libor as long ago as May 2008, according to the latest emailson Tuesday He was also close to Diamond, who congratulated him on his appointment as deputy governor in December 2008. Tucker thanked him for being an \"absolute brick\". In May 2008, Tucker emailed Diamond to say he had spoken to Stuart Gulliver and Johnny Cameron, then heads of HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland's investment banks, and they had agreed to cooperate with an investigation by the British Bankers' Association into how to revamp Libor.</p> <p>\u2022 Tucker was also central to the Barclays fine because a conversation he had with Diamond on October 29 2008 led to Jerry del Missier, then Diamond's deputy, instructing Mark Dearlove, who runs the money market desk, to reduce the Libor submission. Diamond spoke to del Missier about his conversation with Tucker \u2013 who had warned of concerns in \"Whitehall\" about the high Libor submissions \u2013 and wrote an email the next day to then chief executive, John Varley, that ended with the phrase that Barclays' submissions \"did not always need to be so high\". Tucker and Diamond have insisted this was not an instruction to cut the Libor submission. The money market desk informed the compliance department, then led by Stephen Morse, of the instruction (or perceived instruction) to cut the rate.</p> <p><strong>Four things we still need to know</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Will any one be charged with fraud in the UK or the US? King said on Tuesday the deliberate submission of false Libor rates was \"my definition of fraud\".</p> <p>\u2022 Who were the Libor submitters who from 2005 agreed to alter rates in return for favours, sparking emails such as \"this one is for you big boy\" and offers of Bollinger champagne?</p> <p>\u2022 What profits were made on the trades? King likened it to the cricket betting - where matches are not thrown but bets are made on the number of no balls during overs. Libor was \"similar\" he suggested.</p> <p>\u2022 What exactly did Diamond say to del Missier on October 29 2008 that prompted the latter to issue the instruction to cut Libor?</p>",

On the third day after the fine was announced, Turner met Marcus Agius, the Barclays chairman, and the FSA chairman felt he was making it clear that Diamond needed to go. Agius did not mention this meeting when he appeared before MPs, instead saying that on the Friday he met Turner, the bank's shareholders were making it clear they did not want Diamond to go. On Saturday Agius decided to quit, a move interpreted as an attempt to save Diamond. King and Turner were shocked when they read about Agius's departure on the Sunday. One day later King summoned Agius - and the most senior non-executive director, Sir Michael Rake - to tell them Diamond had lost the confidence of the regulators. Agius was \"shocked\" and reinstated himself as executive chairman so Diamond could go. However, Agius will leave once a successor is found. Diamond never failed a \"fit and proper test\" that might ordinarily have been used to remove him from his post. \u2022 Tucker was involved in discussions about Libor as long ago as May 2008, according to the latest emailson Tuesday He was also close to Diamond, who congratulated him on his appointment as deputy governor in December 2008. Tucker thanked him for being an \"absolute brick\". In May 2008, Tucker emailed Diamond to say he had spoken to Stuart Gulliver and Johnny Cameron, then heads of HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland's investment banks, and they had agreed to cooperate with an investigation by the British Bankers' Association into how to revamp Libor. \u2022 Tucker was also central to the Barclays fine because a conversation he had with Diamond on October 29 2008 led to Jerry del Missier, then Diamond's deputy, instructing Mark Dearlove, who runs the money market desk, to reduce the Libor submission. Diamond spoke to del Missier about his conversation with Tucker \u2013 who had warned of concerns in \"Whitehall\" about the high Libor submissions \u2013 and wrote an email the next day to then chief executive, John Varley, that ended with the phrase that Barclays' submissions \"did not always need to be so high\". Tucker and Diamond have insisted this was not an instruction to cut the Libor submission. The money market desk informed the compliance department, then led by Stephen Morse, of the instruction (or perceived instruction) to cut the rate. Four things we still need to know \u2022 Will any one be charged with fraud in the UK or the US? King said on Tuesday the deliberate submission of false Libor rates was \"my definition of fraud\". \u2022 Who were the Libor submitters who from 2005 agreed to alter rates in return for favours, sparking emails such as \"this one is for you big boy\" and offers of Bollinger champagne? \u2022 What profits were made on the trades? King likened it to the cricket betting - where matches are not thrown but bets are made on the number of no balls during overs. Libor was \"similar\" he suggested. \u2022 What exactly did Diamond say to del Missier on October 29 2008 that prompted the latter to issue the instruction to cut Libor?",

But his latest appearance came as he faces a difficult balancing act \u2013 weighing increasing pressure to act as the US's fragile economic recovery wobbles against the political backlash that could come if he does move. Economists are blaming slowing jobs growth and consumer spending on anxiety over Europe's debt crisis and the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" \u2013 the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts and the imposition of $1tn in spending cuts set to occur on 31 December unless a political compromise can be reached. Bernanke is concerned too and told the Senate the Fed had \"made clear at its June meeting that it is prepared to take further action\". But a third round of quantitative easing (QE3) \u2013 a massive bond buying program aimed at supporting the economy \u2013 could spark a political firestorm with Republicans ahead of November's election.

      "body": "<p>There are no longer any UK bankers who are credible candidates to become the next governor of the Bank of England, economist David Blanchflower declared on Tuesday as the interest rate fixing scandal was described by central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic as potentially fraudulent.</p> <p>As the current Bank of England governor, Sir Mervyn King, told MPs the Barclays board had been in a \"state of denial\" about its dealings with regulators, Blanchflower concluded that the only remaining candidate to take over from King next year is Lord O'Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, who has a PhD in economics.</p> <p>More emails were released on Tuesday which appeared to show a close relationship between the former Barclays boss Bob Diamond and deputy governor of the Bank of England Paul Tucker. In one message Tucker thanked Diamond for being a \"brick\" in an email in December 2008.</p> <p>Blanchflower, a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee between 2006 and 2009, had previously cited Lord Green, now a trade minister and a former boss of HSBC, and John Varley, former chief executive of Barclays, as potential candidates. But Green may now face questions over why HSBC failed to adhere to rules to prevent money laundering when he was chief executive and then chairman.</p> <p>\"The last thing you want is a governor who might become tainted by the scandal. That would be hugely embarrassing for the government,\" said Blanchflower. \"It's also tricky for [chancellor George] Osborne. He needs to make an appointment that won't rebound on him at once, or in the future.\"</p> <p>King is due to step down in June 2013, when his second five-year term finishes.

      "bodyText": "There are no longer any UK bankers who are credible candidates to become the next governor of the Bank of England, economist David Blanchflower declared on Tuesday as the interest rate fixing scandal was described by central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic as potentially fraudulent. As the current Bank of England governor, Sir Mervyn King, told MPs the Barclays board had been in a \"state of denial\" about its dealings with regulators, Blanchflower concluded that the only remaining candidate to take over from King next year is Lord O'Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, who has a PhD in economics. More emails were released on Tuesday which appeared to show a close relationship between the former Barclays boss Bob Diamond and deputy governor of the Bank of England Paul Tucker. In one message Tucker thanked Diamond for being a \"brick\" in an email in December 2008. Blanchflower, a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee between 2006 and 2009, had previously cited Lord Green, now a trade minister and a former boss of HSBC, and John Varley, former chief executive of Barclays, as potential candidates. But Green may now face questions over why HSBC failed to adhere to rules to prevent money laundering when he was chief executive and then chairman. \"The last thing you want is a governor who might become tainted by the scandal. That would be hugely embarrassing for the government,\" said Blanchflower. \"It's also tricky for [chancellor George] Osborne. He needs to make an appointment that won't rebound on him at once, or in the future.\" King is due to step down in June 2013, when his second five-year term finishes. The process of appointing his successor is not meant to begin until the autumn, but there has already been plenty of discussion in the City and Westminster about potential candidates who could run Britain's central bank. Two \u2013 Tucker and Financial Services Authority chairman Lord Turner \u2013 were sitting alongside King during Tuesday's hearing with MPs when the governor indicated that the Libor scandal could amount to fraud. As he defended his actions in the affair, insisting he had not known about the deliberate attempts to manipulate the key interest rate, King appeared to suggest that fraud had taken place. While \"everyone was concerned\" about Libor during the 2008 banking crisis, it was \"a million miles away from saying that is the same as deliberate deceitful manipulation of submissions in order to make financial gain. That is my definition of fraud.\" With the Serious Fraud Office investigating any possible criminal cases in the UK, Ben Bernanke, head of the Federal Reserve, agreed there might be criminal offences. In an appearance before the Senate committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs, Bernanke agreed that many Americans have lost out through the \"unacceptable behaviour\" of some individuals. He added that \"based on what I've read about it\", some of the emails between traders as they discussed fixing the Libor appeared to be evidence of fraud. Speaking to MPs for the first time since the Libor scandal erupted almost three weeks ago, King was greeted with scepticism when he said he did not know the detail of the Libor rigging until Barclays' \u00a3290m fine was announced. The governor told MPs there had been \"genuine and deep\" concerns about the relationship between Barclays' bosses and the bank's regulators before the fine was imposed. MPs heard on Monday how Andrew Bailey, the FSA's top banking regulator, regarded Barclays as having a \"culture of gaming\" with the regulator. More details emerged of the behind the scenes efforts by the authorities to force Diamond to quit. Lord Turner said the regulators had urged the Barclays board to oust Diamond after seeing the public reaction to the Libor fine.

This line is nonsense, of course, since we're talking about ugly deceit at the heart of financial system. Even so, the revelations about HSBC almost put Barclays in the shade. Being accused by a US Senate committee of operating a money-laundering conduit for \"drug kingpins and rogue nations\" is as bad as it gets. What happened to the HSBC of legend, the dull bank led by upright conservative types who ensured they employed only similarly good chaps? It seems that, in the period 2004-2010, HSBC's famous federation structure actually meant a management free-for-all. If you were the boss of, say, HSBC's unit in Mexico you were a mini-emperor, answerable to almost nobody. You were even in charge of your own compliance department. The man at head office with the title \"head of group compliance\" was not allowed to barge into your office to ask what checks you had conducted to discover the true source of the very large dollar deposits coming into the bank. The numbers are extraordinary. According to the Senate committee, HSBC accepted more than $15bn (\u00a39.6bn) in bulk cash transactions from subsidiaries in Mexico, Russia and other countries at high risk of money laundering between mid-2006 and mid-2009 but failed to conduct proper checks. To his credit, David Bagley, the head of group compliance in question, offered his resignation to the committee on Monday. He had been in his post since 2002 so one can understand why. But it also appears that HSBC didn't give Bagley the powers to live up to his job title, reducing his status to one of adviser. \"We have sometimes failed to meet the standards that regulators and customers expect,\" admits HSBC. You bet \u2013 a hefty fine, rumoured to be $1bn, is on the way. If HSBC's boardroom had not been in constant turnover in the past few years, heads would have to roll. As it is, chief executive Stuart Gulliver, in the post since December 2010, can paint himself as a zealous reformer. A list of his recent disposals tells a tale not just of a man seeking to simplify HSBC and so make it easier to manage, but also to clean up the bank's act. Disposals have included units in Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Paraguay, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras. Everybody happy then? Should we consign the affair to history and move on? Well, no. HSBC's top executives of the 2004-2010 era are gone but not forgotten. It would be useful to hear from, say, Lord Green, chief executive from 2003 to 2006 and then executive chairman to 2010, about how money-laundering controls at HSBC could have become so lax on his watch. He is currently a trade minister and is also an adviser to George Osborne on banking, so is ideally placed to preach to UK plc about how good intentions are not enough.",

      "bodyText": "The head of compliance at HSBC, one of the world's biggest banks, resigned in front of a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday after admitting the bank had allowed Mexican drug cartels to launder billions of dollars through its US operation for years. David Bagley, who has been HSBC head of group compliance since 2002, stepped down before the homeland security and governmental affairs subcommittee after its findings were published. Bagley, who had spent 20 years with the bank and is based in London, said: \"Despite the best efforts and intentions of many dedicated professionals, HSBC has fallen short of our own expectations and the expectations of our regulators.\" Earlier in the hearing, the subcommittee chairman, senator Carl Levin, said HSBC's compliance culture had been \"pervasively polluted for a long time\". The revelations are another blow to the reputation of the banking industry following the current scandal over the manipulation of the Libor inter-bank lending rate. Irene Dorner, president and CEO of HSBC Bank USA, said in testimony prepared for the hearing that \"we deeply regret and apologise\" for the lapses by HSBC. An investigation by the subcommittee found persistent problems at HSBC which executives ignored. Dorner and other HSBC executives scheduled to testify at Tuesday's hearing say the bank has made deep changes to its policies and corporate culture to prevent illicit use of the bank. London-based HSBC, which is Europe's largest bank, changed its senior management last year. \"These changes will be embedded and sustained going forward,\" Dorner says. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, says HSBC's new policies \"are all good steps.\" But Levin said HSBC needs to identify which of its affiliates pose a high risk of problems, and must put them under close monitoring. The bank should consider closing the account of its Mexican affiliate, Levin said, and should close its accounts with banks suspected of providing funding to terrorist groups. The subcommittee's extensive report on HSBC also concluded that US regulators knew the bank had a poor system to detect problems but failed to take action. HSBC executives brushed off complaints from other bank employees, so that the problems persisted for eight years, the report found. In addition, some HSBC bank affiliates skirted US government bans against financial transactions with Iran and other countries, according to the report. And HSBC's US division provided money and banking services to some banks in Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh believed to have helped fund al-Qaida and other terrorist groups, the report said. The US justice department said it is conducting a criminal investigation into HSBC's operations but declined to confirm that the bank is in settlement talks. HSBC's net income last year was $16.8bn. It operates in about 80 countries around the world, and its US division is among the top 10 banks in America. It has assets of roughly $210bn in its US operations.

Tucker had thanked Diamond for being a \"brick\" in an email in December 2008.</p> <p>In a hearing at the Treasury select committee, Lord Turner, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, was also criticised as he conceded the regulators had urged the Barclays board to remove Diamond after seeing the public reaction to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\" title=\"\">the \u00a3290m Libor fine</a>, rather than because Diamond was no longer regarded as \"fit and proper\" to run a bank.</p> <p>King, speaking to MPs for the first time since the Libor scandal erupted a fortnight ago, was greeted with scepticism when he said he did not know about the Libor rigging until the Barclays fine was announced.</p> <p>The governor told MPs there had been \"genuine and deep\" concerns about Barclays' relationship with its regulators in the period before the fine and MPs had heard on Monday how Andrew Bailey, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/16/barclays-culture-gaming-banking-regulator\" title=\"\">the FSA's top banking regulator, regarded Barclays as having a \"culture of gaming</a>\" with the regulator.</p> <p>King, sitting alongside Tucker and Turner, who are both regarded as potential successors when he leaves next June, repeatedly accused Barclays of \"sailing close to the wind\".

      "bodyText": "Barclays was in a \"state of denial\" about its dealings with regulators, according to Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, as he came under fire from MPs on Tuesday during the latest bout of accusation and counter-accusation over the Libor scandal. As emails were released showing the close relationship between the former Barclays boss Bob Diamond and deputy governor of the Bank of England Paul Tucker, King accused Barclays of repeatedly sailing \"close to the wind\" in its dealings with regulators before Diamond's departure. Tucker had thanked Diamond for being a \"brick\" in an email in December 2008. In a hearing at the Treasury select committee, Lord Turner, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, was also criticised as he conceded the regulators had urged the Barclays board to remove Diamond after seeing the public reaction to the \u00a3290m Libor fine, rather than because Diamond was no longer regarded as \"fit and proper\" to run a bank. King, speaking to MPs for the first time since the Libor scandal erupted a fortnight ago, was greeted with scepticism when he said he did not know about the Libor rigging until the Barclays fine was announced. The governor told MPs there had been \"genuine and deep\" concerns about Barclays' relationship with its regulators in the period before the fine and MPs had heard on Monday how Andrew Bailey, the FSA's top banking regulator, regarded Barclays as having a \"culture of gaming\" with the regulator. King, sitting alongside Tucker and Turner, who are both regarded as potential successors when he leaves next June, repeatedly accused Barclays of \"sailing close to the wind\". He said: \"It is possible to sail close to the wind once, maybe twice or \u2026 three times \u2013 four or five times you do have to ask questions about the navigational skills of the captain on the bridge.\" But Andrew Tyrie, the MP who chairs the select committee, accused the regulators of acting on a \"whim\" in meeting with the Barclays chairman, Marcus Agius, to encourage him to force Diamond out. He later said that \"regulators should not be able to bring arbitrary pressure to bear on the boards of private companies\" and called for tougher governance checks on the Bank of England. Turner admitted that he had met Agius on the third day after the Libor fine was announced to call for changes in the culture at the bank. Both Turner and King admitted to being surprised to learn that the chairman quit over that weekend, rather than Diamond. The decision of Agius to resign \u2013 albeit \"honourable\" according to Turner and King \u2013 prompted King to call in Agius and Sir Michael Rake, the most senior non-executive director on the Barclays board, to spell out on the Monday that the regulators had lost confidence in Diamond. Agius had told the committee last week about this meeting with King but did not mention any conversations with Turner. Diamond's resignation was announced on 3 July, in a sudden move that forced Agius to become executive chairman only the day after he had announced his intention to quit. \"I wanted the chairman to be very conscious of the concerns the regulators had raised. When I met them, the two of them, they had not taken on board the loss of confidence the regulators had with Barclays,\" said King. King said he was clear that the concerns were about the \"executive management\" of Barclays and that the bank now needed to create a \"new culture\". The governor said that the departure of Agius would put \"any future chairman into an impossible position\" as it would have needed the incumbent to either back Diamond or replace him. His deputy Tucker was also in the spotlight after the release of email correspondence in which he thanks Diamond for being \"an absolute brick through this\" following his promotion to deputy governor in December 2008. Diamond had emailed him to say: \"Congratulations, well done man. I am really proud of you\". Tucker caused an incredulous reaction when asked about emails from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York asking about the \"deliberate misreporting\" of Libor in 2007. \"It did not set alarm bells ringing,\" Tucker said. King insisted that he had not known about the Libor rigging until two weeks ago when the Barclays fine was announced, even though there had been correspondence with US regulators in June 2008. He described the Libor rigging as similar to the cricket betting scandal as \"the games weren't being fixed\", but the number of no balls in an over were pre-arranged; that had no influence on the outcome of the match. Libor was similar because the higher or lower submissions were so small that it made it difficult to detect the impact on the rate.",

The British fashion brand has told Interparfums, which owns the licence to make its Burberry Body perfume, that it intends to terminate the agreement on 31 December. However, industry sources said it was a precautionary move as talks, related to a revamp of the fragrance and beauty business, head towards an end-of-month deadline.

      "bodyText": "Wolseley, the FTSE 100 building supplies group, has warned of ongoing \"difficult market conditions\" in continental Europe as it paved the way for the sale or restructuring of its French business. Only months after saying it was planning no European disposals, the world's largest supplier of plumbing materials - from kitchen sinks to shower doors - announced that it is exploring strategic options for its French arm, raising the prospect of selling the unit, slimming it down or hiving it off in a joint venture. Wolseley's finance director, John Martin, said the French business, largely comprised of the country's second largest distributor of building materials, did not fit the company's strategy of targeting market leadership in its territories. \"In most of our market we are market leader or neck-and-neck. Here [in France] we are much smaller and there is no realistic prospect or market leadership. And the returns in France are lower than the rest of the group. That has been the case for many years and it does not give you confidence about increasing investment in the country,\" he said. Wolseley said it was likely to take a writedown against its French business, which employs 5,400 people and generated revenues of \u00a31.3bn last year. An analyst at stockbroker Seymour Pierce, Kevin Lapwood, said Wolseley might shut down its operation across the channel. \"A sale is unlikely in our view as had it been possible, it would have happened already. We therefore believe the company will opt to close a significant part or all of the French business.\" Such a move would face political obstacles in France, where carmaker Peugeot Citro\u00ebn shocked senior politicians last week by announcing plans to cut 8,000 jobs. In May Martin said Wolseley was \"not planning\" to pull out of any European businesses, but a statement this morning confirmed ongoing pressure on its European operations, which include the UK, France, Scandinavia and central Europe. Wolseley also flagged up problems with its Danish business, citing \"challenging\" trading conditions and warning of an impairment charge against its Denmark assets. The group's position in the building materials market makes it a bellwether for the construction and building renovation industries and some of Europe's biggest economies. Referring to Europe as a whole, the group said the outlook had not improved since a third quarter trading statement, when it reported negative sales numbers for all its European territories in the UK, Scandinavia, France and central Europe. \"We reported difficult market conditions in Continental Europe [in Q3] and these conditions have continued,\" said Wolseley. The group did not alter profit guidance but its shares fell 3.4% in early trading to \u00a322.48. Wolseley added that it would incur restructuring costs of \u00a320m, which include 450 jobs losses from its 40,000-strong global workforce including 240 redundancies in the UK which have already been announced. The group owns the Plumb Center chain in the UK and the Ferguson outlets in the US, which is Wolseley's biggest market, generating 40% of the group's \u00a313.6bn in annual revenues. The UK is Wolseley's second largest market but declined by 3% last year, hit by the loss of a supply contract, disposals, and the downturn in taxpayer-funded building projects. The group's French business is dominated by the Reseau Pro chain, the country's second largest distributor of building materials including roofing, timber and flooring. However, its 7% share of the market is four times smaller than that of the market leader, Saint-Gobain, and the business has also been buffeted by weakness in the French economy. Denmark, where Wolseley operates the Stark chain, has also suffered and the group said this was \"likely to give rise to a non-cash impairment charge.\"",
