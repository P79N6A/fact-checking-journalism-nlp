      "bodyText": "Sports Direct and its shareholders are struggling to agree on a heavyweight individual to conduct an independent review of the business before a second vote to re-elect its chairman that must take place by early January. At the retailer\u2019s annual general meeting on 7 September, a majority of independent shareholders voted to oust Keith Hellawell as chairman. At a tense meeting following the AGM, shareholders demanded an independent review of how the company is run as a minimum requirement for working with Hellawell. The Investor Forum, which represented big shareholders in talks with Sports Direct, said at the time the review could be carried out by an experienced person or a law firm. Two weeks after the AGM, Sports Direct agreed to independent scrutiny of its treatment of employees and corporate governance. Sports Direct had wanted the law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain (RPC) to carry out the review but shareholders said it was not independent because it had worked for the company and its founder, Mike Ashley. But other firms could also have perceived conflicts of interest if they have worked for big investors or they might seek work from them in future. An investor familiar with the talks said for that reason both sides were now looking for a credible individual rather than a professional services firm to conduct the review. But the number of qualified people is limited and potential candidates are likely to be busy or wary of putting their reputation on the line. The investor said: \u201cFinding someone acceptable to the board and investors is one thing and persuading them to do it is another. It\u2019s going to be quite high profile and it has to be someone who is prepared to take it on and be ready for that sort of publicity.\u201d The law says Sports Direct has to hold a further meeting to vote on Hellawell\u2019s appointment between 90 and 120 days after the AGM. At that meeting, Ashley can use his majority stake in Sports Direct to push Hellawell\u2019s appointment through but it would be embarrassing if independent shareholders continued to oppose him. The investor said shareholders could be prepared to vote for Hellawell to reward the board for engaging with investors after ignoring protests in the past but that appointing a credible person to lead the review might be needed for them to believe the company was serious about reforming itself. Hellawell, who tried to resign before the AGM, lost the vote after the Guardian\u2019s revelations about working practices at Sports Direct confirmed to many shareholders that there were serious problems with the way the company was run. The revelations coincided with declining financial performance, which galvanised some shareholders who had supported the board before. RPC carried out a preliminary review of working practices that was more critical than some had expected. Sports Direct has pledged to end zero-hours contracts for shop staff and to start moving agency staff at its warehouse on to permanent contracts and to employ a welfare officer and a nurse at the site.",

      "bodyText": "The GMB union has accused Uber of misleading its drivers by claiming last week\u2019s tribunal decision on working conditions only affects two drivers involved in the case. In a long-awaited judgment, an employment tribunal agreed with two drivers for the ride-hailing app that Uber\u2019s drivers were not self-employed and should receive the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, annual leave and other benefits. Uber has said it will appeal against the judgment. James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam brought the case on behalf of a group 19 Uber workers who argued they were employed by the San Francisco-based company and not working for themselves. Lawyers said the victory would affect their fellow Uber drivers and have implications for tens of thousands of workers in the so-called gig economy. But the GMB said Uber sent an email to its 40,000 drivers on Friday, signed by its regional general manager for northern Europe, Jo Bertram, who was criticised by the tribunal judges for using \u201ctwisted language\u201d and for being \u201cgrimly loyal\u201d to her company. Bertram\u2019s email to the drivers said: \u201cAs you may be aware, earlier this year a small number of London partner-drivers brought a claim to challenge their self-employed status with Uber. Although we have today heard that this challenge has been successful at this first stage, it\u2019s very important to note that today\u2019s decision only affects two individuals and Uber will be appealing it. \u201cThere will be no change to your partnership with Uber in light of this decision and we will continue to support the overwhelming majority of drivers who tell us that they use the Uber app to be their own boss and choose when and where to drive.\u201d The tribunal judges dismissed Uber\u2019s claim that its London operation was a mosaic of thousands of small businesses linked by a technology platform as \u201cfaintly ridiculous\u201d. They said Uber resorted to \u201cfictions, twisted language and even brand new terminology\u201d to portray their drivers as self-employed. In their judgment, the tribunal judges singled out Bertram for criticism and quoted from Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet to cast doubt on her testimony. \u201cMs Bertram spoke of Uber assisting the drivers to \u2018grow\u2019 their businesses, but no driver is in a position to do anything of the kind, unless growing his business simply means spending more hours at the wheel. Reflecting on the case, and on the grimly loyal evidence of Ms Bertram in particular, we cannot help being reminded of Queen Gertrude\u2019s most celebrated line: \u2018The lady doth protest too much, methinks.\u2019\u201d Maria Ludkin, GMB\u2019s legal director, said: \u201cEven after the judge found Ms Bertram\u2019s evidence lacked credibility and described her as \u2018grimly loyal\u2019, she continues to try and advance a misleading and false set of facts. The Uber judgment applies to 40,000 UK drivers, not two. Ms Bertram might be wise to think how this judgment reflects on her before she issues any more statements.\u201d Uber will take the case to the employment appeal tribunal, and following its decision there could be further hearings in the court of appeal and then the supreme court. Any payments due to drivers will not be calculated until that process is over. Other drivers with the firm will not automatically receive payouts but, if the company accepts the ruling, it will have to change its contracts to avoid more cases being brought by drivers. Lawyers say that Uber\u2019s terms and conditions are similar for all of its UK operatives. GMB also rejected Uber\u2019s claim that its drivers earned an average \u00a316 an hour and that most wanted to keep the flexibility their current contracts provide. Ludkin said: \u201cThis judgment in no way affects driver flexibility, it merely guarantees them basic employment rights. Uber\u2019s decision to appeal that is purely related to protecting their ample profits and nothing to do with protecting the drivers.\u201d Meanwhile other cases are likely to follow the Uber judgment. Cycle couriers are making similar claims against firms including CitySprint, Addison Lee, eCourier and Excel. Law firms are also talking to workers at Deliveroo, which delivers meals by cycle and motorbike. An Uber spokesman said: \u201cThe ruling would affect the two drivers that were the test cases in the tribunal. However, while we appeal this judgement drivers that use the Uber app remain independent and able to choose when and where they drive.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The EU and Canada signed a free trade deal on Sunday that was almost derailed last week by objections from French-speaking Belgians , exposing the difficulties of securing agreement from 28 member states as Britain prepares for Brexit talks. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said there was no parallel between the deal struck with Canada and looming Brexit talks. \u201cI don\u2019t see any relation between what we are signing today and the Brexit issue,\u201d Juncker said, before greeting Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, in Brussels Trudeau and top EU officials signed the comprehensive economic and trade agreement, known as Ceta, paving the way for most import duties to be removed early next year. However, the treaty needs the approval of at least 38 national and regional parliaments, including the UK\u2019s, to take full force. Trudeau was meant to fly to Brussels last Wednesday but he stayed at home when the Wallonia region raised objections that held up agreement until Thursday. Belgium\u2019s regional parliaments endorsed a compromise deal, which addressed concerns about competition for Wallonia\u2019s farmers from Canada, on Friday. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, who stood beside Trudeau at a news conference, said the delay was caused by Belgium\u2019s internal politics and that the deal would be far less contentious when it went before national parliaments. Tusk said: \u201cFortunately we live in a democratic system and democracy is less predictable than other political systems but I still prefer democracy. My prediction is there is no huge problem with European parliaments. After my talks with all 28 member states\u2019 leaders, I have no doubt Ceta is the least controversial trade agreement you could imagine.\u201d Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, apologised to MPs last week for not allowing a parliamentary debate on the trade deal. He said holding up the agreement would have made the UK unpopular with other EU members but also with Canada and that the deal was worth \u00a31.3bn a year to Britain. Fox said the UK parliament could still veto the deal and he warned that problems in agreeing Ceta showed the difficulty Britain could face in negotiating a trade agreement with the EU. Supporters of Ceta say it will increase Canadian-EU trade by 20% and boost the EU economy by \u20ac12bn (\u00a310.9bn) a year and Canada\u2019s by C$12bn (\u00a37.4bn). Trudeau said consumers and businesses would immediately feel the benefits. \u201cWe are confident that demonstrating that trade is good for the middle classes (...) will make sure that everybody gets that this is a good thing for our economies and that it is also a good thing for the world,\u201d he said. With free trade under attack from populist movements and anti-globalisation campaigners, the deal reduces Canada\u2019s reliance on the US and gives the EU a first trade pact with a G7 economy when its credibility has taken a knock from Britain\u2019s decision to leave. Juncker said: \u201cWe are setting standards which will determine globalisation in the coming years. Nothing in other trade agreements will be able to remain below the level of what we have reached today with Canada.\u201d Geoffrey Yu, the head of UBS Wealth Management\u2019s UK investment office, said the last-minute delay to the deal, which took seven years to agree, showed how difficult it could be to get a decision in the EU. He said: \u201cThe EU\u2019s detractors will cite Ceta\u2019s travails as another example of the bloc\u2019s institutional failures. In some respects, the impasse is a vindication of the UK electorate\u2019s decision to leave the EU and pursue its own agreements.\u201d He said when the UK government was free to make its own trade deals after leaving the EU, it should target willing partners such as emerging markets.",

However, the treaty needs the approval of at least 38 national and regional parliaments, including the UK\u2019s, to take full force. </p> <p>Trudeau was meant to fly to Brussels last Wednesday but he stayed at home when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/belgium-reaches-deal-with-wallonia-over-eu-canada-trade-agreement\">the Wallonia region raised objections that held up agreement until Thursday</a>. Belgium\u2019s regional parliaments endorsed a compromise deal, which addressed concerns about competition for Wallonia\u2019s farmers from Canada, on Friday.<br></p> <p>Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, who stood beside Trudeau at a news conference, said the delay was caused by Belgium\u2019s internal politics and that the deal would be far less contentious when it went before national parliaments.</p> <p>Tusk said: \u201cFortunately we live in a democratic system and democracy is less predictable than other political systems but I still prefer democracy. My prediction is there is no huge problem with European parliaments. After my talks with all 28 member states\u2019 leaders, I have no doubt Ceta is the least controversial trade agreement you could imagine.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/eus-tough-post-brexit-stance-puts-politics-over-prosperity-says-liam-fox\">Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, apologised to MPs last week for not allowing a parliamentary debate on the trade deal.</a> He said holding up the agreement would have made the UK unpopular with other EU members but also with Canada and that the deal was worth \u00a31.3bn a year to Britain.</p> <p>Fox said the UK parliament could still veto the deal and he warned that problems in agreeing Ceta showed the difficulty Britain could face in negotiating a trade agreement with the EU.</p> <p>Supporters of Ceta say it will increase Canadian-EU trade by 20% and boost the EU economy by \u20ac12bn (\u00a310.9bn) a year and Canada\u2019s by C$12bn (\u00a37.4bn).</p> <p>Trudeau said consumers and businesses would immediately feel the benefits. \u201cWe are confident that demonstrating that trade is good for the middle classes (...) will make sure that everybody gets that this is a good thing for our economies and that it is also a good thing for the world,\u201d he said. </p> <p>With free trade under attack from populist movements and anti-globalisation campaigners, the deal reduces Canada\u2019s reliance on the US and gives the EU a first trade pact with a G7 economy when its credibility has taken a knock from Britain\u2019s decision to leave.</p> <p>Juncker said: \u201cWe are setting standards which will determine globalisation in the coming years. Nothing in other trade agreements will be able to remain below the level of what we have reached today with Canada.\u201d</p> <p>Geoffrey Yu, the head of UBS Wealth Management\u2019s UK investment office, said the last-minute delay to the deal, which took seven years to agree, showed how difficult it could be to get a decision in the EU.<br></p> <p>He said: \u201cThe EU\u2019s detractors will cite Ceta\u2019s travails as another example of the bloc\u2019s institutional failures. In some respects, the impasse is a vindication of the UK electorate\u2019s decision to leave the EU and pursue its own agreements.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said when the UK government was free to make its own trade deals after leaving the EU, it should target willing partners such as emerging markets.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A tumbling pound is the defibrillator shock that Britain\u2019s ailing exporters desperately needed to halt their terminal decline. That\u2019s the message repeated on an almost daily loop by economists for Brexit. Now that sterling has lost almost a fifth of its value against the dollar and about 14% against the euro since the referendum, it follows that the EU referendum vote was the best thing that could happen to the economy. Almost overnight, manufacturers have found the price of their goods abroad have dropped, making them more competitive. They just need to let the currency work for them, revving up production safe in the knowledge they can undercut their rivals. It is a narrow economic argument that uses Germany\u2019s exporting prowess as a template. This success is all about exporting upmarket cars, trucks and machine tools to China, Brazil and the Middle East. German goods are well designed and reliable, of course. They also come with the added bonus of being priced using an artificially low rate of exchange gifted by the euro. It is safe to say the rest of the world would be far less interested in German products if they were still priced in Deutschmarks, no matter how reliable or well designed they were. They would simply be too expensive. With the euro in place, Germany has kept manufacturing at the heart of its economy, accounting for about 20% of its national income. The UK manufacturing sector accounts for less than 10%. John Mills, the Labour-supporting businessman, has long campaigned for a lower pound. In his most recent pamphlet, The Exchange Rate, he outlines the costs of going back to an era when a strong currency created a large balance of payments deficit and a cascade of side-effects, from weak investment through to low productivity and stagnant wages. The central premise of his argument is that once a relatively low exchange rate is established, investors and businesses have a clear view of the better profit margins on offer from exports and will invest more in the latest machinery and industrial processes. Manufacturers that scramble day-to-day in a desperate bid to remain part of supply chains beyond the already world-beating car, aerospace and pharmaceutical industries will take risks that mean productivity jumps in leaps and bounds. Britain needs a sunny postcard from the future now that the immediate effects of a low pound are making life difficult for consumers. Import prices are rising and already feeding into shop prices. We\u2019ve seen the early signs: Apple added \u00a3500 to the cost of its latest MacBook Pros and Unilever\u2019s prices, including for Marmite, leaped by more than 10% at Morrisons. Consumer confidence surveys have dipped in the last month after a post-referendum bounce and might deteriorate further should the two things people covet the most \u2013 the latest mobile phone and a new car \u2013 increase in cost once the currency hedges that keep prices stable run out. We import all the phones and a majority of the cars we buy, so prices are going to rise some time after Christmas, if not before. Yet the chances of mimicking Germany are slim. Firstly, there is the currency itself. We have a floating exchange rate against the rest of the world, which means it goes down in the bad times and up in the good times. Why would a manufacturing company bet on the currency staying low when a recovery in the UK\u2019s fortunes will send it back up again. Neither the Treasury, nor the Bank of England has expressed an appetite for managing the pound. It is impossible, they claim, arguing that Japan\u2019s experiment with driving down its currency has run out of steam after only a couple of years. All it took was for the big investment funds to be spooked by China\u2019s slowdown in 2015 for money to flood into Tokyo, pushing up the yen to almost where it was before the experiment started. Japan\u2019s answer was to flood its financial system with yet more central bank money, hoping that would depress the currency. China responded with a devaluation of its own, which the authorities can stealthily carry out by diktat regardless of market sentiment. Closer to home, the European Central Bank has, despite its denials, used its funds as part of an unofficial programme of currency suppression for the last two years. These examples show something else. Everyone is at it. Not just the UK. They all think the remedy for their ailing manufacturing companies is a swift devaluation. And they are better placed to do it and maintain it without making cataclysmic decisions like leaving a free trade bloc they\u2019ve belonged to for 40 years. A look at the texbooks and recent analysis by the International Monetary Fund would say that any cut in the exchange rate should boost the supply of goods for exports. But can we, hand on heart, say British boardrooms and investors are in any way primed to exploit this. Let\u2019s set aside the comments by the trade minister, Liam Fox, that Britain is too fat and lazy to grab the chance offered by a low pound and new trading routes. Britain has shown it is better than that. But how, after 40 years of decline, when energy costs are three times what they are in the US or China (because they have their own supplies), when the banks are still risk-averse after almost going bankrupt eight years ago, when the nation\u2019s non-immigrant population is ageing and skills training is sliced as part of more general austerity cuts, can the UK manufacturing sector say it is poised for action? John Mills would pull all the levers of the state to keep the pound low and offset any side-effects. Its a jigsaw puzzle of measures that needs all of the pieces to be in place. It\u2019s a tall order. You only need to look at what happened last week in Texas to highlight the difference between the UK and some of its European neighbours. Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine Group, one of the largest steelmakers in the world, employing more than 40,000 people , unveiled a new \u20ac550m plant in the south-western US state that will run on gas, not coke, thus reducing its emissions and costs dramatically. The company long ago jettisoned the steel rolling mills that churn out basic commodity products, unlike British Steel, which in 1999 threw in its lot with Dutch rival Koninklijke Hoogovens in the belief that creating Corus, the world\u2019s third largest steel producer, would be the route to success. The merged company expanded without investing and now lies stricken in the arms of Tata. Voestalpine invested and specialised. Cheap natural gas from local Texan fields will mean it can cut its costs considerably. Its boss, Wolfgang Eder, said the annual bill for operating a similar plant in Austria would be an extra \u20ac200m a year.",

    "webTitle": "UK seeking tariff-free EU deal for carmakers, Nissan told", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nissan was told the UK was seeking an EU deal that would mean no tariffs for car manufacturers and no bureaucratic impediments to trading, Greg Clark, the business secretary, has revealed. Clark said he wrote to Nissan with a series of four assurances as he went \u201call out\u201d to allay concerns about Brexit and convince the company to build its next two models in Sunderland. The government has been under pressure for days to reveal what it promised Nissan to secure the investment and whether there would be any implications for taxpayers in future. Three days after the deal was announced, Clark revealed on BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show he had told Nissan the government was confident of getting a deal that would mean the whole car industry remained competitive. That suggests No 10 is seeking a free trade relationship similar to the single market and customs union. At the same time, Theresa May has said she wants greater immigration controls and freedom from the oversight of the European court of justice; a combination of aims that Brussels politicians have repeatedly said is unachievable. Clark said: \u201cOur intention, our negotiating remit, when it comes to the discussions with our European partners is to have a constructive dialogue and look for the common interest here. Our objective would be to ensure we have continued access to the markets in Europe and vice versa without tariffs and bureaucratic impediments, and that is how we will approach those negotiations.\u201d He suggested that this applied to the car industry in general, and possibly other major sectors of UK business. The government repeatedly refused to confirm it had given Nissan any written guarantees last week, but Clark revealed on Sunday that he had sent the carmaker a letter containing four assurances. He said the promises included a continuation of funds for training and skills, regional relocation grants, scientific research and keeping the industry competitive at the point the UK leaves the EU. On the promise relating to Brexit, he said the UK could not know the outcome of negotiations with the other 27 members but it was \u201cvery important that we make a commitment to keep competitive the UK industry\u201d through the government\u2019s industrial strategy. The business secretary said there was no specific promise to compensate Nissan or other carmakers if they did face tariffs because that would not be allowed under competition laws. Clark\u2019s interview immediately led to criticism that the government has been telling industry more about No 10\u2019s negotiating aims that the UK electorate. Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, told ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday that Nissan \u201chas been told more about it than we have in parliament\u201d, adding that the government had \u201cgot to come clean\u201d. The senior Labour MP also accused the prime minister of prioritising greater immigration controls over the health of the UK economy as she headed towards triggering Brexit early next year. Starmer said the government still needed to disclose the terms of any deal struck with Nissan. He said he intended to seek an urgent question in the House of Commons on Monday to try to compel ministers to reveal any guarantees that they may have given. \u201cThere may be a financial element to it \u2013 I accept that. They say no money is changing hands,\u201d he told Peston on Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We need to know and I\u2019m going to try and raise this in parliament \u2026 because something has been said. It\u2019s good Nissan are investing, of course it\u2019s good, but there are other businesses up and down the country of every size and every sort that need (reassurance).\u201d A key question for May will now be whether she is willing for the UK to continue paying into the EU budget in order to secure tariff-free trade without bureaucratic customs checks. Nadhim Zahawi, a leading Brexit supporter and Conservative MP for Stratford-upon-Avon, wrote in the Mail on Sunday that paying a proportion of the UK\u2019s annual \u00a38.5bn would be worth it for favourable trading arrangements combined with freedom from the EU\u2019s immigration rules and the jurisdiction of its courts. \u201cI was one of those who campaigned to leave, but the government should be absolutely clear that our motive is not for the European Union to fail \u2013 we just don\u2019t think it is right for us,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is why we should pay a proportion of the \u00a38.5bn that we will save through leaving back into its budget. We should help bridge some of the EU\u2019s funding gap, but only on the condition that the EU delivers our demand of providing British businesses with tariff-free access to the single market.\u201d",

At the same time, Theresa May has said she wants greater immigration controls and freedom from the oversight of the European court of justice; a combination of aims that Brussels politicians have repeatedly said is unachievable.</p> <p>Clark said: \u201cOur intention, our negotiating remit, when it comes to the discussions with our European partners is to have a constructive dialogue and look for the common interest here. Our objective would be to ensure we have continued access to the markets in Europe and vice versa without tariffs and bureaucratic impediments, and that is how we will approach those negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>He suggested that this applied to the car industry in general, and possibly other major sectors of UK business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98a2ada91ca6a40b2d10643053505ac20c5eaee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98a2ada91ca6a40b2d10643053505ac20c5eaee5/0_184_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Business secretary Greg Clark on BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Business secretary Greg Clark on BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/27/no-10-denies-sweetheart-deal-with-nissan\">refused to confirm</a> it had given Nissan any written guarantees last week, but Clark revealed on Sunday that he had sent the carmaker a letter containing four assurances. He said the promises included a continuation of funds for training and skills, regional relocation grants, scientific research and keeping the industry competitive at the point the UK leaves the EU.</p> <p>On the promise relating to Brexit, he said the UK could not know the outcome of negotiations with the other 27 members but it was \u201cvery important that we make a commitment to keep competitive the UK industry\u201d through the government\u2019s industrial strategy. The business secretary said there was no specific promise to compensate Nissan or other carmakers if they did face tariffs because that would not be allowed under competition laws.</p> <p>Clark\u2019s interview immediately led to criticism that the government has been telling industry more about No 10\u2019s negotiating aims that the UK electorate. Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, told ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday that Nissan \u201chas been told more about it than we have in parliament\u201d, adding that the government had \u201cgot to come clean\u201d.</p> <p>The senior Labour MP also accused the prime minister of prioritising greater immigration controls over the health of the UK economy as she headed towards triggering Brexit early next year.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/gates-closing-tensions-rising-brexit-feels-tangible-and-frightening\">Nissan is an early sign of the downturns and the divisions Brexit could bring | Will Hutton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Starmer said the government still needed to disclose the terms of any deal struck with Nissan.</p> <p>He said he intended to seek an urgent question in the House of Commons on Monday to try to compel ministers to reveal any guarantees that they may have given. </p> <p>\u201cThere may be a financial element to it \u2013 I accept that.

      "bodyText": "As we near Halloween night, there is a growing sense of foreboding about the economy\u2019s prospects next year, even among Brexiters. The one word that is having a chilling effect \u2013 stagflation \u2013 is best known from its 1970s incarnation, when it wrought havoc throughout the land. The combination of stagnant GDP growth and high inflation pushed the country to the edge of bankruptcy and forced the then chancellor, Denis Healey, to call the International Monetary Fund for a bailout loan. Its resurrection can only spell bad news. The former Bank of England policymaker Adam Posen is past trick-or-treating and is not known for scaremongering, but he was doing his best Jack-Nicholson-in-The-Shining impression last week when he said Britain would suffer \u201cpermanent damage\u201d from the Brexit vote. The economist, who is back in his native US running a thinktank, likened the UK to an athlete who injures an ankle and gets arthritis. They limp on. \u201cThey\u2019re not dead,\u201d he said, but can\u2019t run with the major league players any more. What word summed up the nightmarish future? Stagflation, he sighed. At the heart of this argument is a forecast for rising inflation and slowing wage rises in 2017 that will kill off today\u2019s healthy GDP growth. The increase in inflation is a global trend driven by higher oil and commodity prices, made worse by the 18% fall in the pound since the referendum. Slowing wage rises follow the uncertainty that infects all business investment decisions in the UK, as firms delay or cancel the purchase of new equipment that enhances productivity. This could all be set aside as a temporary situation, much as it was in 2011 and 2012, when Posen was a member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee and inflation stood at 5%. Back then the political situation was stable, and interest rates were not just at rock bottom, they were priced by the markets as being low for the next 30 years. To boost growth, the Bank began a second phase of quantitative easing, taking the total stimulus package to \u00a3375bn, safe in the knowledge that politicians and central bankers were aligned. The backdrop to the Brexit vote is different. For one thing, the political situation is full of uncertainties. Businesses rightly ask whether Theresa May wants to stay inside the European Union\u2019s single market or the customs union or neither. There was a clue in the deal with Nissan, which was widely interpreted as signalling that she wants to stay in the customs union. But it could be that she panicked when faced with the closure of a world-beating car factory and carved out a special package offsetting the impact of Brexit. May has refused to shed any light on the details of her apparently cosy deal with the Japanese carmaker, and so speculation fills the void, emphasising the lack of coherent thinking at the top of her government. Worse, May and some former colleagues have painted Threadneedle Street as the enemy of good government, adding to the unease. Investors are also concerned about the impact of rising yields on government bonds, which determine the rate at which nations can borrow. UK gilt yields have doubled since the vote, forcing the Treasury to pay more to finance its debts. And there are more threats waiting in the wings. The US central bank is poised to raise interest rates in December after third-quarter growth beat expectations to hit an annualised 2.9%. Higher interest rates across the Atlantic will attract money away from the UK to US banks, pushing the pound down further. If this feeds into higher import prices and ratchets up inflation, disposable incomes will slump even more. As we saw from the UK\u2019s third-quarter GDP figures last week, the economy is currently buoyant, but almost entirely dependent on consumer spending and without it will probably begin to slowly contract. If this all sounds overly gloomy, it doesn\u2019t to Posen and many other economists in academia and the City. They\u2019ve seen a ghost of Christmas future, and it scares them. RBS can\u2019t wind up the spinoffs When the European Union was handing out punishments for the bailouts of Britain\u2019s banks during the 2008 crisis, one of its wheezes was to force the two institutions which had been the recipients of most of the cash to spin off branch networks. The aim was to create new competitors on the high street and, no doubt, inflict a bit of pain on the way. Roll on eight years from the drama of the bailouts, and one of those branch networks has emerged. Lloyds Banking Group stripped out TSB in 2013 and floated it on the stock market in 2014, before it was taken over by Sabadell of Spain. It is alive and kicking and grabbing market share in current accounts. It is still tied to its former parent by an IT system, but is trying to cut itself loose. Contrast that with Royal Bank of Scotland, which has now admitted it will not meet a deadline of the end of 2017 to carve out 300 branches, focused more on small businesses. It has been a messy affair and costs have reached \u00a31.7bn in attempting and failing to meet this deadline. A sale to Santander was aborted. Then there was to be an attempt to float the branches on the stock market \u2013 a bit like TSB \u2013 by reviving the old brand name of Williams &amp; Glyn. That was abandoned in the summer. Now hopes are on a trade buyer who might be able to cherrypick the most attractive branches. While this is a costly problem for RBS, which at one point deployed 7,500 on the task of creating a standalone branch network, it is one that has also deprived bank customers of an extra competitor on the high street. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, has admitted that the UK\u2019s departure from the EU is not a cue to give up on the process \u2013 and Brussels may not be in the mood to look kindly on Britain\u2019s bailed-out bank during the exit negotiations. It is a mess, and one which could get dirtier if the EU decides to impose its own rules on the selloff process. John Lewis mustn\u2019t become a soulless profit machine She\u2019s landed one of the most coveted jobs in retail, but when new John Lewis boss Paula Nickolds takes the helm in January she\u2019ll have her hands full. Profits were already falling in the first half of this year, and the decline of the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote will only add pressure. Some analysts believe Nickolds needs to do more ruthless cost-cutting than her predecessor, Andy Street. But it\u2019s worth remembering that John Lewis navigated the last downturn successfully precisely because it invested when others cut back. Cheery, knowledgeable staff in stores and a big step up in online capability proved winners. John Lewis\u2019s partnership model, under which staff own the business, allows for long-term thinking. Staff and customers will thank Nickolds for nurturing its special feel, not turning John Lewis into a soulless profit machine.",

      "bodyText": "It was a balmy 17C in London on Friday as unseasonably warm weather persisted in large parts of the country. Wearing shorts as the clocks go back may be pleasant for most people, but it\u2019s a nightmare for clothes shops. Clothing made up less than half of Debenhams\u2019 annual sales for the first time, partly due to warm weather, and the department store group has hired BHS\u2019s former lighting buyers to help make up for falling fashion sales. On Wednesday, we\u2019ll hear from Next, which vies with Marks &amp; Spencer to be Britain\u2019s biggest clothes retailer. It\u2019s only a month or so since Next reported its half-year results. Then, chief executive Lord Wolfson said trading was unpredictable as customers in the south stuck with their summer gear while autumn came to Aberdeen. Squeezed consumer incomes, and the trend for people to spend any spare cash on a night out instead of new threads, added to fashion sellers\u2019 problems, he said. If things aren\u2019t going well at Next, investors can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned, and some of Next\u2019s problems, such as lack of stock, have been of its own making. The shares of what was once seen as a rock-solid performer have fallen from \u00a38 to less than a fiver in the past 12 months, but Wolfson\u2019s words still have the potential to cause a stir in the industry before the important Christmas trading season. FTSE 100 still a no-go area for minorities How many black Britons have risen to become a FTSE 100 chief executive? The answer is none. The industrialist Sir John Parker will address this state of affairs when he publishes his report on Wednesday into representation of ethnic minorities in business. Two black FTSE 100 bosses come to mind: Tidjane Thiam, who left Prudential for Credit Suisse last year, and Arnold Donald at Carnival. That is progress of sorts but Thiam is from Ivory Coast and Donald is from the US. Things aren\u2019t much better for other minorities. A study by recruiter Green Park last year found just four non-white FTSE 100 chief executives, and the proportion of ethnic minority executive directors had fallen to 4% from 5.2% in a year. Companies will argue that barriers to advancement lie in wider society, the education system and all that. Parker will no doubt acknowledge those problems but surely more pressure is needed. As with women on boards, where progress has been made, companies should start by recruiting non-executive directors from minority backgrounds \u2013 and preferably from Britain. Companies should also report what they are doing to bring ethnic minority employees into the ranks of senior managers. Strong backing from the government would help. Marmite madness at Morrisons Oh, Morrisons, what were you thinking? On Friday it emerged that the supermarket chain had put up prices on 92 Unilever brands, including \u2026 Marmite. Only a couple of weeks ago, Tesco hit the front pages when it ran low on the nation\u2019s favourite yeasty spread in a spat with Unilever over price increases. Tesco played a blinder and reached an accommodation with Unilever over the dispute, which was depressingly but predictably called Marmitegate. So why didn\u2019t Morrisons leave Marmite alone while bumping up the prices of less emotive Unilever brands? When you\u2019re in a war with Aldi, Lidl and Tesco for shoppers, headlines about price rises aren\u2019t welcome. Morrisons publishes a trading statement on Thursday. When the Bradford-based grocer reported on progress last month, things seemed to be picking up under David Potts, who took over in March 2015 when sales were plunging. Sales at established stores have now risen for three quarters. Potts has cut prices, but he\u2019s also been improving service and products \u2013 especially pies \u2013encouraging customers to trade up to premium ranges and doing simple things like putting food on the go near the door. If there\u2019s more encouraging news this week, let\u2019s hope it\u2019s not overshadowed by the Marmite episode.",
