      "bodyText": "Full marks for timing, Mr President. Last week marked the 10th anniversary of the start of the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, making it an appropriate moment for Donald Trump to threaten North Korea with obliteration. One of the few achievements Trump can point to in his first six months in office is that shares on Wall Street have been steadily rising since his election victory last October. The \u201cfire and fury\u201d remark and the inevitable counter blast from Kim Jong-un gave the markets pause for thought. But not much more than that. All things considered, the financial markets took the Kim and Trump show in their stride. Sure, there was a sell-off in shares and the customary flight to safe haven assets such as gold and the Swiss franc in times of heightened tension. But nothing to touch the panic of a decade ago, when the markets suddenly froze up and banks refused to lend to each other. This is part of a recent pattern. Markets have become relaxed about geopolitical risk and with good reason. Wall Street started rising from the moment Iraq was invaded in 2003. There was barely any response to Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimea in 2014. The assumption underlying the muted response is that there will be no war between the US and North Korea, nuclear or otherwise, and that the smart investment play is to buy into any dips. The markets are part right. It still looks unlikely that Trump will sanction a pre-emptive strike. Kim knows that, which is why he would be dumb to up the ante by aiming some missiles into the sea off Guam first. But the financial markets \u2013 and the broader global economy \u2013 could still turn nasty in an repeat of what happened 10 years ago even without a shooting war. Over the past decade, markets have shrugged off geo-political risk but have proved much more vulnerable to economic and financial risk. And there\u2019s plenty to worry about in that respect. For a start, the world has never really recovered from the last crisis. Growth rates have been weak and have only been possible because years of low interest rates and quantitative easing have encouraged consumers and businesses to rack up large amounts of debt. As the economist Steve Keen notes in his new book Can we avoid another financial crisis (Polity), many countries have become what he calls debt junkies. \u201cThey face the junkie\u2019s dilemma, a choice between going \u2018cold turkey\u2019 now, or continuing to shoot up on credit and experience a bigger bust later.\u201d Keen says the countries to watch out for have two characteristics: they already have high levels of personal debt and have relied substantially on credit as a source of demand in the past five years. Australia, Canada, South Korea, Sweden and Norway are all on his list of candidates to be future debt zombies. But so is China. In the 25 years leading up to the financial crisis, China developed a hugely successful growth model. There was a mass exodus of people from rural districts to work in newly built factories that \u2013 courtesy of low wages and an under-valued currency \u2013 were able to flood the west with cheap exports. But the model relied on consumers in western countries \u2013 such as the US \u2013 taking on more debt to buy these exports. When the financial crisis of a decade ago ended in a deep recession, demand for Chinese goods suddenly dried up. With the risk that factory closures and mass unemployment would breed political unrest, the Chinese government replaced the burst western credit bubble with a credit bubble of its own. They ordered banks to lend freely to property developers and backed this up with a massive public infrastructure programme. The banks have $35tn of assets on their balance sheets \u2013 a fourfold increase since 2008. China\u2019s private debt as a proportion of the country\u2019s annual economic output (GDP) has increased from 120% to 210% over the same period. The lesson of 2007 is that all bubbles burst eventually. Alan Greenspan solved the problem of the bursting of the dotcom bubble by creating an even bigger bubble in the US housing market, and the Chinese authorities have done something similar. Indeed, the structure of the Chinese financial system, with its large shadow banking system and special investment vehicles that take assets off balance sheets, looks eerily like the financial systems in the US and the UK in the years leading up to the crisis. When China\u2019s Ponzi scheme comes crashing down \u2013 as it inevitably will \u2013 contagion to the rest of the global financial system will be limited by the fact that the banks are largely state owned and capital controls are still in place. Beijing will do what the west did in 2008 and bail out banks in danger of collapse. Even so, the economic shock to the rest of the world will be immense. Since 2008, China\u2019s credit-driven expansion has accounted for more than half global growth. One obvious trigger for the pricking of the Chinese credit bubble would be US trade sanctions. When he was a candidate for the White House, Trump pledged to get extremely tough with Beijing, threatening tariffs of up to 40% on Chinese imports into the US. He has subsequently toned down the rhetoric in the hope that Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, would pressure Kim over North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme. China\u2019s decision to back harsher UN economic sanctions against Pyongyang suggests there was some merit in this approach. But Beijing\u2019s insistence last week it would sit on the sidelines in the event of a war between the US and North Korea shows that there are limits to how far China is prepared to go, and this may not be far enough for Trump. If it becomes clear that China cannot rein Kim in, the US has an array of economic weapons at its disposal. It has made clear that it will slap tariffs on cheap Chinese steel and aluminum, and will punish intellectual property piracy. The US could also brand China a currency manipulator, something Trump ruled out during in his love-in with Xi when they met in Florida in April. Such a move would pave the way for further sanctions and inevitable retaliation from China. Until recently, it has been hard to see where the next financial crisis comes from. Now it is blindingly clear. Trump is talked down from attacking North Korea but decides that somebody has to pay for his climbdown. China, seen to have shown insufficient support, is the obvious candidate. Economic sanctions are imposed, a trade war erupts and China\u2019s credit bubble bursts. The financial markets have yet to wake up to this possibility. It is probably about time they did.",

      "bodyText": "Not everybody can be the next Facebook \u2013 or least not easily or quickly. This has been a hard lesson for investors in Snap, owner of Snapchat. They should have known it all along, of course, since Facebook has never disguised its ambition to crush any social media upstarts that get in its way. But it didn\u2019t prevent Snap being valued at a colossal $28bn on its first day of trading on the US stock market in March. Five months later, the valuation has halved, prompting chief executive Evan Spiegel to pledge that he and co-founder Bobby Murphy won\u2019t sell any of their shares this year. This promise was meant to signal the duo\u2019s deep belief in the long-term success of Snap. In fact, the gesture was no more than the minimum required to sustain flagging spirits. If the founders had left their options open with the shares trading below their IPO price, there would have been panic. As it was, the shares fell 16% after second-quarter results on Thursday. Debate around those figures was dominated by Spiegel\u2019s assertion that Wall Street analysts are looking at his camera app company through the wrong lens. Forget about the number of daily users, he argued with irritation, and look at the amount of time users spend on Snapchat, and how much advertisers are willing to pay. Spiegel\u2019s general point is fair: advertising revenue is what ultimately counts. The trouble is, Snap doesn\u2019t yet have a good story to tell on that front. Average revenue per user was $1.05 in the quarter, up from $0.90 in the previous three months. A quarter-on-quarter increase of 16% is not be sniffed at, but the revenue numbers only become explosive when combined with lots of new users. Snap added only 7.3 million, a quarter-on-quarter rise of only 4%, to reach 173 million. No wonder Spiegel would prefer people to look somewhere else. The awkward fact remains that Snap is actually a small company in its industry. Revenues were $182m in the quarter and $331m over six months. That suggests that reaching $1bn for 2017, as some on Wall Street had expected, will be a stretch. Even if it achieved that, is it really sensible to value Snap at 14 times its revenues? The figure seems absurd when you remember that this is a six-year-old business that still makes heavy losses and has to face the formidable companies of Facebook \u2013 especially Instagram, which seems to be directly aimed at Snapchat these days. One can\u2019t blame Spiegel, of course, if investors were prepared to put such a high price on hope at the IPO. Investors were so mad for a slice of the action that they all allowed him to get away with the governance outrage of issuing shares with no voting rights whatsoever. That\u2019s their lookout. But Snap\u2019s overhyped IPO, and subsequent share price fall, naturally prompts the question of whether there\u2019s a wider bubble in the US technology market. The short answer is probably no. Or, rather, if there is, it is a different kind of bubble from the one that popped in 2001. Back then, almost every stock with a \u201cnew economy\u201d tag went up like a rocket. Investors have learned to discriminate. Stocks such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Tesla remain hellishly difficult to value by old yardsticks, but the market is commendably ruthless in punishing the shares of overpromoted companies that disappoint financially, like Twitter. The same process now seems to be under way at Snap. The IPO itself was a triumph of the investment bankers\u2019 art of generating a buzz and a fear of missing out. But now the party is over. Spiegel may not like the sudden blast of scepticism, but he should be braced for more of the same. It\u2019s healthy. To command even Snap\u2019s shrunken valuation, you have to do more than invent an animation of a dancing hot dog, the current viral sensation. You have to show you can make money from it. Family ties and animal fat should never catch out the Bank The mistakes that forced Charlotte Hogg to resign as deputy governor of the Bank of England in March are well-documented. One of the UK\u2019s best-connected individuals \u2013 her parents both had leading roles in John Major\u2019s government and her grandfather was Quintin Hogg, better known as Lord Hailsham \u2013 had forgotten to disclose that her brother (also Quintin) worked at Barclays. She compounded her error by telling MPs on the Treasury select committee that the Bank knew about her brother\u2019s role, before having to admit that she had not disclosed this and was therefore in breach of the Bank\u2019s code of conduct \u2013 which she had helped write. Now, though, it is clear that the Bank could have handled the case better. A review commissioned by the Bank\u2019s non-executive directors into the embarrassing chain of events found that the usual processes were not followed when she first joined the Bank in 2013. There was an \u201cinformal exchange of emails\u201d with the then chair of the Bank\u2019s oversight body \u2013 the court of directors \u2013 and nothing more. \u201cA more structured approach may have resulted in Ms Hogg\u2019s brother\u2019s role being registered at the outset,\u201d the reported pointed out. Well, quite. The Bank has now pledged to sort out its processes and make the matter of conflicts of interests clearer during interviews. It should set itself a goal to ensure that no one else ever has to leave under such circumstances. It might also think about how it got itself into such a mess over banknotes. Its new plastic notes \u2013 indestructible even when dipped in curry by governor Mark Carney \u2013 are not so durable in the face of public scrutiny. They\u2019re made with tallow, an animal fat, and so are unacceptable to millions of UK residents \u2013 vegans, vegetarians, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and others \u2013 according to a petition. The Bank is, however, sticking with tallow: using palm oil was found to cause its own problems. These are two situations that, perhaps, the Bank could have handled better from the start. Wilko pins its woes on the \u2018national living wage\u2019 \u201cChancellor Osborne\u2019s final austerity budget surprised the industry by its unilateral imposition of a statutory minimum living wage at well above expected levels,\u201d reports Wilko, the family-owned homewares and households goods retailer, in its annual report for last year. That overly dramatic description was perhaps a warm-up for last week\u2019s announcement that almost 4,000 jobs at the company are at risk. This was presented as an exercise in internal restructuring \u2013 a stripping out of a layer of management \u2013 but a grumble about the former chancellor\u2019s 2015 budget all helps to encourage the idea that outside forces are upsetting the retail sector. Yet times can\u2019t be too hard at Wilko, despite the expansion of rival discount chain B&amp;M in the homewares market. The Wilkinson family still managed to pay themselves a \u00a33m dividend for the year. That wasn\u2019t imposed on them. Rather, it was a conscious choice.",

Stocks such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Tesla remain hellishly difficult to value by old yardsticks, but the market is commendably ruthless in punishing the shares of overpromoted companies that disappoint financially, like Twitter.</p> <p>The same process now seems to be under way at Snap. The IPO itself was a triumph of the investment bankers\u2019 art of generating a buzz and a fear of missing out. But now the party is over. Spiegel may not like the sudden blast of scepticism, but he should be braced for more of the same. It\u2019s healthy. To command even Snap\u2019s shrunken valuation, you have to do more than invent an animation of a dancing hot dog, the current viral sensation. You have to show you can make money from it.</p> <h2>Family ties and animal fat should never catch out the Bank</h2> <p>The mistakes that forced Charlotte Hogg to resign as deputy governor of the Bank of England in March are well-documented. One of the UK\u2019s best-connected individuals \u2013 her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/jun/20/profile-charlotte-hogg-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">parents both had leading roles in John Major\u2019s government</a> and her grandfather was Quintin Hogg, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/oct/15/guardianobituaries.conservatives\" title=\"\">better known as Lord Hailsham</a> \u2013 had forgotten to disclose that her brother (also Quintin) worked at Barclays.</p> <p>She compounded her error by telling MPs on the Treasury select committee that the Bank knew about her brother\u2019s role, before having to admit that she had not disclosed this and was therefore in breach of the Bank\u2019s code of conduct \u2013 which she had helped write.</p> <p>Now, though, it is clear that the Bank could have handled the case better. A <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Documents/ieo/nedreview0817.pdf\" title=\"\">review commissioned by the Bank\u2019s non-executive directors</a> into the embarrassing chain of events found that the usual processes were not followed when she first joined the Bank in 2013. There was an \u201cinformal exchange of emails\u201d with the then chair of the Bank\u2019s oversight body \u2013 the court of directors \u2013 and nothing more.</p> <p>\u201cA more structured approach may have resulted in Ms Hogg\u2019s brother\u2019s role being registered at the outset,\u201d the reported pointed out. Well, quite.</p> <p>The Bank has now pledged to sort out its processes and make the matter of conflicts of interests clearer during interviews. It should set itself a goal to ensure that no one else ever has to leave under such circumstances.</p> <p>It might also think about how it got itself into such a mess over banknotes. Its new plastic notes \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/sep/14/mark-carney-tests-new-5-plastic-note-video\" title=\"\">indestructible even when dipped in curry by governor Mark Carney</a> \u2013 are not so durable in the face of public scrutiny. They\u2019re made with tallow, an animal fat, and so are unacceptable to millions of UK residents \u2013 vegans, vegetarians, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and others \u2013 according to a petition. The Bank is, however, sticking with tallow: using palm oil was found to cause its own problems.</p> <p>These are two situations that, perhaps, the Bank could have handled better from the start.</p> <h2>Wilko pins its woes on the \u2018national living wage\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cChancellor Osborne\u2019s final austerity budget surprised the industry by its unilateral imposition of a statutory minimum living wage at well above expected levels,\u201d reports Wilko, the family-owned homewares and households goods retailer, in its annual report for last year.</p> <p>That overly dramatic description was perhaps a warm-up for last week\u2019s announcement that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/11/wilko-warns-nearly-4000-staff-could-lose-jobs\" title=\"\">almost 4,000 jobs at the company are at risk</a>. This was presented as an exercise in internal restructuring \u2013 a stripping out of a layer of management \u2013 but a grumble about the former chancellor\u2019s 2015 budget all helps to encourage the idea that outside forces are upsetting the retail sector.</p> <p>Yet times can\u2019t be too hard at Wilko, despite the expansion of rival discount chain B&amp;M in the homewares market. The Wilkinson family still managed to pay themselves a \u00a33m dividend for the year. That wasn\u2019t imposed on them. Rather, it was a conscious choice.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018A visitor from Mars would assume that the UK is under attack from a hostile power seeking to destroy our economy and many of our national institutions \u2026 But there is no hostile foreign power. The threatened damage is entirely self-inflicted.\u201d This forceful reflection on the state of the nation comes from Sir Brian Unwin, former president of the European Investment Bank, one of the many EU institutions from whose work the British economy has benefited through our membership. Sir Brian was involved in the occasional negotiation with Brussels, not least on behalf of Mrs Thatcher during the EEC budget-rebate squabble during the early 1980s. The Treasury was never wholly in love with the rest of the EU, but it does know where this country\u2019s bread is buttered, and it can recognise a suicide note when it sees one. Among the chaotic group of cabinet ministers who are concerned with negotiating Brexit there appears to be one grown-up minister who recognises the absurdity of it all, and that is the chancellor, Philip Hammond. His desperate attempts to seek \u201ctransitional\u201d arrangements to ease the pain appear to be gaining support. However, the unfortunate truth is that, even if he manages to win over his hard-Brexiter colleagues \u2013 which is a big \u201cif\u201d \u2013 the damage is being done now. There is simply too much uncertainty for business and the City, with investment decisions being delayed, or investment plans being relocated to within the single market. And our treasured institutions, including the health service, higher education establishments and the arts, are already facing recruitment problems. The transitional strategy aims to retain the benefits of the customs union and the single market beyond the current two-year negotiation period, but there cannot be any serious guarantee of success. In a Radio 4 discussion with the modern historian Peter Hennessy last week, Tony Blair said he had found the British civil service to be good at managing, but not at changing things. Well, it is now tasked with the most monumental change imaginable in our relations with the rest of Europe, and, frankly, it is finding the management of this well-nigh impossible. As a heavy realisation about Brexit descends, I find that a popular question arises. Whom do you blame the most: David Cameron? Boris Johnson? Jeremy Corbyn? But the most convincing answer has been provided by the former Conservative MP Matthew Parris. The culprit is the Conservative party. Parris accuses the party of being criminally irresponsible in landing Britain with the triggering of article 50 without the vaguest plan, and with Brexit meaning different things to different party members. By contrast, when the question came up during the early years of the post-1997 Blair/Brown Labour government, a quite phenomenal degree of work went into the pros and cons of putting the pound into the single currency. No fewer than 20 volumes of study and analysis lay behind the famous \u201cfive tests\u201d exercise, which preceded the decision not to join. In comparison with the implications of that decision, the intention \u2013 one can hardy call it a \u201cplan\u201d \u2013 to leave the EU is a thousand times more complex, yet analysis and study were conspicuous by their absence, with the chaotic results that now bedevil the British polity. Can the Brexit culprit be the very same Conservative party whose prime minister Harold Macmillan never recovered from having his application to join the community turned down by General de Gaulle, his wartime friend, in 1963? And of Sir Edward Heath, who had worked for Macmillan on that earlier attempt, and who finally succeeded in securing our entry in 1973? It is a popular view that Cameron\u2019s handling of the referendum ranks him as the most disastrous British prime minister since Lord North, who lost the American colonies. However, there was no chance that those colonies could ever be regained. Whereas I firmly believe, despite all the propaganda to the contrary, that it is not too late to reverse the referendum decision made by 37% of the electorate, many of them basing their judgment on outright lies perpetrated by the likes of Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. Which brings us to the latest outbreak of British jingoism, prompted by the release of the film Dunkirk. The fantasists who \u201cwant our country back\u201d nurture a blinkered view of the second world war, in which the retreat from Dunkirk was somehow a victory, and we won the war without the aid of the Commonwealth, the US and \u2013 yes \u2013 Soviet Russia. Be that as it may, we certainly made a major contribution to the defeat of Hitler. And we played a huge role in rebuilding the war-ravaged continent of Europe, even if we were slow to sign up to what eventually became the EU. It is surely payback time. Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron know full well what folly Brexit would be for both Britain and the continent. Not to put too fine a point upon it, we made our wartime and postwar contribution to rescuing and rebuilding Europe and now we need to be rescued from our folly in return. Obviously, we have to wait for the result of the September German elections. But what is urgently needed is an act of consummate statesmanship in which our fellow EU members call urgent discussions with what is left of the British government and make an offer calculated to save us. This could then be put to parliament and the electorate, who are likely to be increasingly aware of the damage the mere thought of Brexit is causing.",

      "bodyText": "Eggs from a Dutch farm involved in a contamination scare have found their way on to some UK supermarket shelves, it would appear. If Asda workers find any of the offending items in the stockroom, they may just feel tempted to hurl them in the direction of their bosses. The struggling supermarket chain has begun a consultation with more than 3,000 staff over possible redundancies or a dramatic reduction in working hours. Asda is looking to cut costs after reporting its worst full-year results since it was taken over by US giant Walmart in 1999, with profits falling 19% to \u00a3791.7m. The big four supermarkets continue to face intense competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl, and are also facing pricing pressures following the recent fall in the value of the pound. Asda replaced chief executive Andy Clarke last year and brought in Walmart veteran Sean Clarke to try to turn things round. There was a slight improvement at the start of the new financial year, with like-for-like sales in the first three months of 2017 falling 2.8%, compared with a 2.9% drop in the final three months of 2016. On Thursday, Walmart will unveil its latest update, including news of Asda\u2019s second-quarter performance, and analysts will be keen to see if the improving trend has continued. Are two heads better at a big fund manager? Keith Skeoch and Martin Gilbert know each other so well that they often go fishing together. Tomorrow they will find out whether that means they can also work together, when Standard Life (run by Skeoch) and Aberdeen (created by Gilbert) complete their \u00a311bn merger. Aberdeen\u2019s shares will be delisted from the stock market, leaving Standard Life as the quoted vehicle for the enlarged company, to be called \u2013 surely not \u2013 Standard Life Aberdeen. The two men will have to run the company \u2013 which will become the UK\u2019s biggest fund manager, with \u00a3660bn under management \u2013 together. They are to be co-chief executives, an arrangement that is usually frowned upon by investors and has already sparked some anxiety among City analysts. Gilbert is the more gregarious of the two. Skeoch has tried to quell concerns, telling the FT: \u201cIt ain\u2019t just the Martin and Keith show; there are 9,000 people across the combined group.\u201d Some 800 jobs are expected to go over the next three years, however. A test of their success as joint bosses will be if they are both still there at the end of the integration period. Hairy times in social housing for Mears Social housing and care home builder Mears rarely makes the headlines, and probably regretted doing so a couple of months ago, when it emerged that it had banned some workers from having beards on health and safety grounds. Mears said workers needed to be clean-shaven so they could safely wear tight-fitting dust masks, but the Unite union called the decision penny-pinching and said the company was going for the cheapest option. Mears of course disagreed. It said: \u201cEvery employer in the UK has a legal responsibility to ensure that employees working in dusty or otherwise potentially hazardous environments are properly protected, and in recent years employers have been prosecuted for failing to fulfil this duty.\u201d The company will hope the dust has settled on the issue when it reports first-half figures on Tuesday. Analysts at Peel Hunt expect Mears to report a flat profit of \u00a318.1m, with a 14% rise in its housing business but a \u00a31m loss from its care operations, where the market remains challenging. But the analysts are feeling positive about its prospects: \u201cWe remain confident in the longer-term market\u2019s dynamics and management\u2019s efforts to further improve the quality of earnings/cash flow should be reflected in a higher rating.\u201d",

A test of their success as joint bosses will be if they are both still there at the end of the integration period.</p> <h2>Hairy times in social housing for Mears</h2> <p>Social housing and care home builder Mears rarely makes the headlines, and probably regretted doing so a couple of months ago, when it emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/01/construction-firm-mears-bans-workers-from-having-beards\" title=\"\">it had banned some workers from having beards</a> on health and safety grounds.</p> <p>Mears said workers needed to be clean-shaven so they could safely wear tight-fitting dust masks, but the Unite union called the decision penny-pinching and said the company was going for the cheapest option.</p> <p>Mears of course disagreed. It said: \u201cEvery employer in the UK has a legal responsibility to ensure that employees working in dusty or otherwise potentially hazardous environments are properly protected, and in recent years employers have been prosecuted for failing to fulfil this duty.\u201d</p> <p>The company will hope the dust has settled on the issue when it reports first-half figures on Tuesday. Analysts at Peel Hunt expect Mears to report a flat profit of \u00a318.1m, with a 14% rise in its housing business but a \u00a31m loss from its care operations, where the market remains challenging.</p> <p>But the analysts are feeling positive about its prospects: \u201cWe remain confident in the longer-term market\u2019s dynamics and management\u2019s efforts to further improve the quality of earnings/cash flow should be reflected in a higher rating.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The threat of greater regulatory scrutiny and a dip in Sky\u2019s share price weighed on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s ambitions to take full control of the satellite broadcaster last week. But investors are looking ahead to whether the upcoming Premier League TV rights auction might result in Fox having to sweeten its \u00a311.7bn offer. Last week, culture secretary Karen Bradley again postponed calling in the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to scrutinise the deal, asking media regulator Ofcom to further examine the Murdochs and their adherence to broadcasting standards. Bradley has said she intends to call in the competition regulator to scrutinise media plurality issues (as the deal would see the Murdochs controlling UK assets ranging from Sky News to the Sun and Times newspapers), but has not made up her mind about whether to ask it to also look at broadcasting standards issues. Ofcom said it had found no grounds for asking the CMA to look at issues including the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News, but there are many opponents of the deal \u2013 including Ed Miliband, Vince Cable and campaign group Avaaz \u2013 and some have threatened legal action if the government does not launch a full investigation. Alice Enders of Enders Analysis says Fox will not be overly concerned at the latest extension. Bradley is widely expected to leave the decision until after parliament returns from summer recess on 5 September. \u201cFox will \u2026 feel the CMA will give a fairer, depoliticised hearing,\u201d she said. \u201cFor Bradley it is about additional legal cover. She is taking very seriously the threat of a judicial review. She is being risk-averse, and the political environment [with no Tory majority] is unfavourable. She is being cautious.\u201d Nevertheless, Sky\u2019s share price has sunk to its lowest since December, when news broke of Murdoch\u2019s bid to buy the remaining 61% of the company, reflecting investors\u2019 fear that the deal may not happen. Two analysts examining Sky\u2019s break price \u2013 the level its shares would trade at if there was no deal \u2013 against its current price and Murdoch\u2019s \u00a310.75 offer reckon that investor sentiment estimates completion as about 55% likely. \u201cThe biggest risk was Ofcom\u2019s test of whether the Murdochs were fit and proper owners of Sky\u2019s licence, and they passed that,\u201d said one Sky shareholder. \u201cThe stock reacted very positively when that decision came through \u2026 I don\u2019t think Sky\u2019s share price is a true reflection of the likelihood of the deal going ahead or not. Most people would say it is 75% to 85% likely to complete, but no one is willing to price that in.\u201d Investors will be also be watching the outcome of the Premier League TV rights auction later this year, with analysts estimating that the broadcaster may have to stump up 40% to 45% more than it currently pays. They have factored in Sky adding \u00a3600m a year to its cost base. \u201cThe outcome of the rights auction could materially influence the [profits] Sky makes,\u201d said one analyst. \u201cThe City has baked into their forecasts a \u00a3600m increase; if you ended up with a much better deal than that, it would have to drive a fundamental reappraisal of Fox\u2019s bid price.\u201d Former top Sky executive Mike Darcey thinks that, after a string of bidding battles, Sky and BT may this time reach an equilibrium in how the seven Premier League TV rights packages are divided. He believes that unless a new rival makes an unlikely entrance and ratchets up the bidding \u2013 someone such as Amazon, which recently poached the UK rights to ATP World Tour tennis from Sky \u2013 \u201cnatural\u201d inflation over the past three years could see the price rise by no more than 15%. The analyst says that, in such a case, Sky\u2019s extra payments would rise just \u00a3200m a year \u2013 not \u00a3600m \u2013 and analysts would expect the extra \u00a3400m to become profit instead. Financial models, he said, look at such figures over 10-year spans, which would imply profits of \u00a34bn needing to be factored into Sky\u2019s business. That would have a huge impact on how Murdoch\u2019s offer is viewed. He went on: \u201cIf the City is way off on inflation \u2013 if it comes in lower, not higher \u2013 either Fox will be getting the deal of the century or [Sky] investors will be saying: \u2018hang on \u2013 we just got massively undersold\u2019.\u201d",
