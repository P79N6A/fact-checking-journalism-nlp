The total is up from 455 towers in the pipeline in 2016, according to research from the industry forum New London Architecture (NLA) and real estate consultancy GL Hearn. Construction has started on 115 towers, also a record. Over the past two years, work started on more projects than in the preceding five years combined. Twentytwo, formerly nicknamed \u201cthe Pinnacle\u201d and then \u201cthe Stump\u201d after work stalled, will be \u2013 at 62 storeys or 278 metres \u2013 the tallest building in the City of London when it is completed next year. However, in the 2020s it will be overtaken by 1 Undershaft, nicknamed the Trellis, at 290m. Two of Europe\u2019s tallest residential towers will be the 233-metre Landmark Pinnacle on the Isle of Dogs and the 235-metre Spire London, also in Canary Wharf. Both are expected to be completed by 2020. But they do not come close to the Shard, which, at 310 metres, remains the tallest building in Europe. The report also recorded signs of a slowdown. Last year 40 tall building projects were under way, a 25% drop on 2016, and 18 were finished, down 30%. Projects now typically take three to four years from start to finish rather than two to three years as before. The number of applications for new towers last year was down by 10% from 2016 and by 35% from 2015, when an application for Greenwich Peninsula was made involving more than 40 tall buildings. Peter Murray, the NLA chair, said the slowdown was to be expected. \u201cThe uncertainties created by Brexit are causing projects to be postponed, while higher stamp duty introduced by George Osborne in December 2014 continues to impact on the market.\u201d The planned towers could provide 106,000 new homes by 2030, while the mayor of London has called for 66,000 new homes a year.

      "bodyText": "The latest IMF world economic outlook released yesterday contains the usual mix of good news and bad news so beloved of economists. But amid the projections for GDP growth the IMF delivers not only some warnings about the risks ahead, but also a slap to governments around the world who are now seeing the chickens of decades of policy that has driven inequality coming home to roost. Gone are the days of the pessimistic IMF world economic outlook reports that seemed like conversations at an emo-economists convention. Just two years ago the April 2016 outlook was titled \u201cToo Slow for Too Long\u201d, but the latest outlook released this week is much more upbeat \u2013 \u201cCyclical Upswing, Structural Change\u201d. And there has certainly been an upswing. Whereas in 2016 the world economy grew by just 3.2% \u2013 the slowest since the GFC year of 2009, in 2017 the IMF estimates the world\u2019s GDP grew by 3.8% \u2013 the fastest since 2011: The big strength came from the advanced economies of Europe, the USA and Japan, while China\u2019s steadily slowing growth improved to 6.9% - the first time growth had increased since 2011. The really good news has been the US \u2013 the stimulus from the tax cuts, which look set to massively increase the US government\u2019s budget deficit, has seen the IMF over the past year increase its estimate of growth for 2017 and 2018. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday A year ago the IMF was projecting the US economy would grow by 2.5% over the following 12 months. It then revised that figure down to 2.3% in the October 2017 outlook, before increasing it in January to 2.7%. Now it projects growth of 2.9%: For Australia, the IMF sees growth much in line with that projected by the treasury and RBA (not surprising given they use these projections as a guide) and has the economy set to grow at 3% this calendar year \u2013 which is roughly what it has been estimating would be the case for the past five years. Our unemployment rate is projected to continue to fall from its current level. The IMF however is less optimistic now about how quickly it will fall. A year ago the IMF projected Australia\u2019s unemployment rate in 2019 would average 4.97%, whereas the current estimate remains in line with its projections of October last year of 5.16% and that it will only get to 4.97% in 2020. What has changed since October is that rather than continue to fall in 2021 and 2022, the IMF now believes it will remain at that 4.97% level: The IMF\u2019s projections are rather more optimistic than those of either last year\u2019s budget or the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook issues in December. The Myefo has our unemployment rate in 2019-20 falling only to 5.25%. It will be interesting to see if these more optimistic figures are reflected in the projections in next month\u2019s budget: But the IMF is rather hesitant to remain optimistic. The IMF\u2019s economic counsellor and director of the research department, Maurice Obstfeld, told the media that \u201cthe present good times will not last for long\u201d, which rather begs the response of, \u201cwait, these are the good times?!\u201d One reason the IMF sees bad news ahead is that the US tax cuts which have provided some stimulus are unfunded, and thus there will need to be some severe spending cuts in the coming years. Trump\u2019s economic plan is essentially the equivalent of a party host passing around the tequila bottle at a party and telling everyone they\u2019re having so much fun now that they won\u2019t get a hangover tomorrow. The IMF also throws into the ring the issue of Trump\u2019s trade wars, suggesting that \u201can escalating cycle of trade restrictions and retaliation is another risk\u201d. And Trump is not exactly someone who has shown himself able to mitigate risk. But the problems are more structural than just a Trump presidency. The IMF notes that \u201cin advanced economies, aging populations and lower projected advances in total factor productivity will make it hard to return to the pre-crisis pace for the average household\u2019s income growth\u201d. Certainly GDP per capita is suggested to slow across the major economies \u2013 including Australia: Here the IMF hands out a well-deserved slap to governments (and to be honest, itself, given its own policies prescriptions of the past 30 years). The outlook suggests that one of the risks ahead is that following from the GFC there are higher debt levels and \u201cwidespread public scepticism about policymakers\u2019 capacity and willingness to generate robust and inclusive growth\u201d. It argues that \u201cdiminished prospects for household income growth in advanced economies, coupled with trends of higher polarisation in jobs and incomes, have fuelled a widespread political backlash hostile to traditional political modalities\u201d. Or in other words \u2013 when you spend 30 years telling everyone we need greater labour market flexibility, greater international competitiveness, and you find households incomes don\u2019t grow, don\u2019t be surprised if voters start getting antsy when you suggest more of the same. It\u2019s not that all the economics policies of the past 30 years have failed to deliver \u2013 the problem is what they failed to consider \u2013 that growth needs to be inclusive, not geared towards the top end. And yet here the IMF remains hostage to its own history. In its most recent review of Australia\u2019s economy, it noted approvingly plans to cut the company tax rate. And yet such a policy is hardly inclusive and merely continues the trend since 1980 which has seen the richest 1% in this county go from holding 4.5% of national income to more than 9%. The IMF notes that \u201c scepticism will only be reinforced \u2013 with negative political consequences down the road \u2013 if economic policy does not rise to the challenge of enacting reforms and building fiscal buffers\u201d. I would suggest that means being willing to note that the race to the bottom of the company tax rates is not the way to improve things, lest you wish to continue calling a period of flat household income growth \u201cthe good times\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "House prices in London have recorded their first annual fall in nearly a decade, according to government figures showing gains in every other region across the country. In the latest sign that the property market in the capital is slowing down, figures from the Office for National Statistics show the average price of a home in London fell by almost \u00a35,000 over the 12 months to February. Despite prices rising in some areas of the capital, the central borough of Tower Hamlets, skirting the eastern edges of the City of London and encompassing the financial district of Canary Wharf, recorded the steepest falls \u2013 with average prices down by almost 8%. The average price of a home for the capital as a whole was \u00a3471,986, down from a peak of \u00a3488,247 last July. For the UK as a whole, the growth rate slowed to 4.4% in the year to February, having risen at an annual rate of 4.7% a month earlier. Just as prices dropped in London by 1% over the course of the year there were strong gains elsewhere, including Scotland and the Midlands, where property values rose by more than 6%. The shifting fortunes for the British property market underscore the impact of Brexit uncertainty and increases in stamp duty, which have cut the number of average sales \u2013 particularly for pricier homes in the capital. Before the financial crisis there were as many as 1.6m property transactions each year, though this number has since slumped to about 1msince 2014. Liam Bailey, the head of research at the estate agents Knight Frank, said increasing stamp duty costs in recent years had made buying a property \u201cfundamentally much more expensive than it was a decade ago\u201d. While the market was nowhere near as bad as 2009 and there was some uncertainty triggered by Brexit, he said: \u201c[Stamp duty has meant] transaction volumes are lower as people are buying and staying put for longer.\u201d While the long-term behavioural change for people to move less has depressed activity in the housing market, the decline in London may raise hope among first-time buyers that homes could be becoming more affordable. Research from the Resolution Foundation thinktank this week suggested up to one in three of Britain\u2019s millennial generation will never own their own home, with many likely to live and raise families in insecure, privately rented accommodation throughout their lives. While house prices in London remain out of reach for many people on average salaries, homes elsewhere across the country are more affordable. The lowest average price continued to be in the north-east at \u00a3128,000. The average national house price was \u00a3225,000, an increase of \u00a39,000 from February 2017. Prices are rising from a much lower base outside of London and the south-east, having taken longer since the financial crisis to start increasing again. But a shortage of homes being built across the country could put pressure on prices to rise further still over the coming years. High levels of employment and the gradual return of rising real wages, as the inflationary effects of the Brexit vote begin to fade, should also push property values higher for the time being. Craig McKinlay, sales director at the mortgage lender Kensington, said: \u201cThere is no quick-fix for the government here, only long-term investment in housing infrastructure will help alleviate the situation.\u201d According to figures from the Bank of England, the number of mortgage approvals in February fell to 63,910, sliding below the six-month average, suggesting there could be further weaker activity to come in the housing market. There could also be greater pressure should the Bank raise interest rates next month, pushing up the cost of a mortgage and acting as a further drag on the value of UK property. According to the consultancy Capital Economics, annual growth will remain subdued over the next few years, while prices in London could fall by up to 3% this year and 5% in 2019. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, the economic forecasting group, said: \u201cHousebuyers will likely be concerned about further interest rate hikes over the coming months.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "UK inflation unexpectedly fell last month to its lowest level in a year, raising questions over whether the Bank of England will raise interest rates next month. In the latest sign of the waning impact of the Brexit vote on household finances, the consumer price index (CPI) dropped to 2.5% in March, according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected the annual rate of growth in prices to remain unchanged at 2.7%. Sterling fell by a cent against the dollar on foreign exchanges, taking it back below $1.42, as economists said the bigger-than-expected moderation for the rising cost of living weakened the case for an interest rate hike next month. However, many economists still expect the Bank of England, which had been forecasting CPI to average 2.9% over the first three months of 2018, to raise rates in May. James Smith, an economist at ING Bank, said: \u201cMay still looks like a fairly done deal but it might give them a bit of a headache for raising rates later this year.\u201d Inflation has fallen in recent months as the impact of the sudden drop in the value of the pound after the EU referendum begins to fade. Having pushed up the cost of imported goods, the slide for sterling damaged the economy as squeezed consumers reined in their spending. However, the Bank has warned that an upswing for global growth could push inflation up again, putting upward pressure back on the cost of living in the UK just as the effects of the Brexit vote diminish. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has also argued that the economic growth rate at which higher inflation is triggered is lower than at the time of the 2008 financial crisis. In its latest snapshot the ONS said women\u2019s clothing prices rose more slowly than usual for this time of year, while alcohol and tobacco also helped to ease the pressure on inflation. There was some upward pressure from the rising cost of recreation and cultural activities, as well as from car prices. Philip Hammond\u2019s decision to move the budget to the autumn meant there were no changes to tobacco duties at this time of year, as can typically be the case. Government statisticians also said the price of goods leaving factories continued to slow, attributing this to a smaller increase in the price of food products. Economists at Barclays said bad weather conditions from the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d in March and the absence of any increase for tobacco duty meant inflation could rise within the next month, adding: \u201cA good portion of the decline can be explained by one-off factors that are likely to reverse.\u201d The drop in inflation will come as the latest signal of strength for the UK economy after new figures this week showed rising real earnings for British workers. Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the drop in inflation was \u201cfurther good news\u201d after the figures showing wage growth. \u201cWe want everyone to be able to earn more and keep more of what they earn, so more pounds stay in people\u2019s pockets,\u201d he said. Labour said the inflation figures were still above the Bank of England\u2019s target rate set by the government of 2%, which meant there was still significant pressure on households. There are also further warning signs for the road ahead, as ministers negotiate the country\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. The International Monetary Fund forecasts Britain\u2019s economy will underperform the rest of Europe, except Italy, over the course of the next two years. There is also the prospect that rising global trade barriers triggered by Donald Trump\u2019s standoff with China could derail hopes for the UK to strike free trade deals around the world after Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap Britain has been given some relief from the spectre of inflation, after the cost of living eased last month. The UK consumer prices index only rose by 2.5% in March, down from 2.7% in February. That\u2019s good news for households, as wages rose by 2.8% per year in the last three months. The Office for National Statistics said the drop in inflation was due to weaker-than-usual price rises for women\u2019s clothing, and the lack of new duties on alcohol and tobacco also helped (because the budge has been moved to the Autumn). Here\u2019s the full story: Britain\u2019s Retail Price Index rose by 3.3% - meaning that student loans will rise by up to 6.3% from September. The government, though, says relatively few people will earn enough to be affected by the change. Economists are split over whether falling inflation will deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates next month. The International Monetary Fund has warned that global debt levels are now higher than before the 2008 crisis, as it urges governments to get a grip. America, though, is on track for higher borrowings thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts: The Fund also warned that the world economy faces a bumpy road, with risks of a downturn rising. The slowdown in London\u2019s housing market has driven prices down, year-on-year, for the first time since 2009. Oil prices have hit a three-year high, thanks to falling stocks and reports that Saudi want prices to head higher, perhaps to $100. In the City, the FTSE 100 is up 88 points - or 1.2% - its highest level since late February. That\u2019s probably all for today. Newsflash: Oil has hit a new three-year high, as new figures show a surprise fall in US energy stocks. Brent crude has jumped over 2% to $73.30, the highest level since November 2014. US crude oil has also risen sharply, to $68.48. The surge came after America\u2019s Energy Information Administration reported that crude supplies fell by 1.1 million barrels last week. Oil was also boosted by speculation that Saudi Arabia is keen for crude to rise to $80 or even $100 per barrel. Reuters reported: Over the past year, Saudi Arabia has emerged as OPEC\u2019s leading supporter of measures to boost prices, a change from its more moderate stance in earlier years. Iran, once a keen OPEC price hawk, now wants lower prices than Saudi Arabia. Industry sources have linked this shift in Saudi Arabia\u2019s stance to its desire to support the valuation of state oil company Aramco ahead of the kingdom\u2019s planned sale of a minority stake in an initial public offering.... \u201cWe have come full circle,\u201d a separate high-level industry source said of the change in Saudi thinking. \u201cI would not be surprised if Saudi Arabia wanted oil at $100 until this IPO is out of the way.\u201d More here: Exclusive: OPEC\u2019s new price hawk Saudi Arabia seeks oil as high as $100 - sources The Department for Education has got in touch about the rise in student loan interest rates to up to 6.3%. They confirm that March\u2019s RPI inflation figure will indeed be used to calculate repayments from September, but they also insist that relatively few people will be affected by the change. That\u2019s because only the better-paid borrowers will clear their debts within the 30-year timescale anyway, due to the way they are repaid. For everyone else, it will simply affect the total that is eventually written off. A government spokesperson said: \u201cOur decision to raise the minimum repayment threshold for student loans to \u00a325,000 is saving 600,000 graduates up to \u00a3360 per year from this month. \u201cThis change in interest rate will make no impact on a borrowers\u2019 monthly repayments and very few people are likely to be affected by the increase. Once the loans are in repayment, only borrowers earning over \u00a345K are charged the maximum rate. This ensures that they make a fair contribution to the system. \u201cThe government\u2019s review of post-18 education and funding is also underway and will look at how students and taxpayers are getting value for money, including the role of interest rates.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy table showing the new repayment rates, depending on how much one earns. Under \u00a325K: 3.30% (March\u2019s Retail Price Index reading) \u00a330K: 4.05% \u00a335K: 4.80% \u00a340K: 5.55% Over \u00a345K: 6.30% Here\u2019s some reaction to the IMF\u2019s warnings on global debt, and bitcoin: Newsflash: The IMF has issued a stark warning that country\u2019s need to tackle their debt levels, before the next crisis strikes. From Washington, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: The global economy is more deeply indebted than before the financial crisis and countries need to take immediate action to improve their finances before the next downturn, the International Monetary Fund has said. The IMF said a prolonged period of low interest rates had stimulated a build-up of debt worth 225% of world GDP in 2016, 12 points above the previous record level reached in 2009. China was responsible for much of the increase, the IMF said, but noted that developed, emerging market and low-income countries all now looked vulnerable. The Washington-based institution used its half-yearly fiscal monitor to single out the US for particular criticism, saying that Donald Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus \u2013 a package of tax cuts and spending increases \u2013 was leading to a bigger budget deficit at a time when it should be on the way down. More here: Over in Washington, the International Monetary Fund is warning that the world\u2019s financial system faces a \u2018bumpy road\u2019. In its new Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR), the IMF says that the short-term risks have risen, thanks to rising geopolitical tensions and fears of a trade war. ...and there\u2019s even a (small) danger that the entire global economy suffers a contraction in the medium term. The Fund says: Given current financial conditions, risks to financial stability and growth are high over the medium-term. This reflects the fact that recent years of low interest rates\u2014needed to support economic growth\u2014have provided an environment in which vulnerabilities have been building. These vulnerabilities could exacerbate the next economic downturn and could also make the road ahead bumpy. The IMF\u2019s concerns include: Weaker credit quality: as companies with more dubious credit records have borrowed heavily in the market External debt in emerging-market and low-income countries: the ultraloose monetary conditions in advanced economies sent a flood of funds into the developing world, and there could be turbulence if it flows out again. The Fund is also worried about the rise of crypto assets such as bitcoin, saying they could destabilise the global economy unless regulators are alert: Some of the technologies behind these assets could make financial market infrastructures, such as payment systems, more efficient. But they have also been afflicted by fraud, security breaches, and operational failures\u2014and have been associated with illicit activities. While the limited size of crypto assets suggests they currently pose little risk to financial stability, risks could grow if their use became more widespread without appropriate safeguards. The fall in the pound today has helped to push shares in London to a six-week high. The FTSE 100 has gained 63 points to 7289, its highest level since the end of February. A weaker sterling will, all things being equal, push up the value of exporters\u2019 income from overseas, and thus their share price. Mining companies are leading the risers, thanks to a rise in the price of commodities today. Nickel is surging, on predictions that it could be included in any further sanctions against Russia. Today\u2019s inflation report is bad news for Britain\u2019s students - and anyone paying off a student loan. That\u2019s because the UK\u2019s Retail Prices Index, another inflation measure, is used to calculate the repayment rate on student debt. The system uses a sliding scale -- those earnings less than \u00a321,000 per year are charged RPI, then there is a sliding scale up to RPI +3% (6.1%) where income is \u00a341,000 or more. Current students are also charged RPI +3% on their loans. RPI rose by 3.3% in March - high than the 3.1% recorded in March 2017. So, the interest rate on student debt is going to be as much as 6.3% from this autumn (up from 6.1%). That\u2019s eye-wateringly steep, given Bank of England base rate is just 0.5%. It\u2019s a complicated situation -- only the wealthier ex-students will ever end up earning enough to clear their debts (MoneySavingExpert have a good explanation here) The BBC\u2019s Sean Coughlan thinks the government might intervene.... Those affected may feel aggrieved that RPI, rather than the (lower) CPI, is used. And they have a good case. The ONS itself has ruled that RPI is flawed and over, and should not be designated as a National Statistic at all! Paul Johnson, the well-respected head of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, says RPI is simply not up to the job: Danielle Haralambous, UK Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, also suspects the Bank of England will hike borrowing costs next month: \u201cInflation was softer than expected, but the decline in the headline rate won\u2019t be a complete surprise to the Bank of England\u2019s policy-setting committee, which expects annual inflation to ease this year as the impact of the pound\u2019s past depreciation fades. But the committee is also looking at other data showing domestic price pressure still in the pipeline, notably a pick-up in wage growth and firm input prices. We expect these factors to keep inflation well above the bank\u2019s target for much of this year and support the case for a gradual normalisation of UK monetary policy. In our view, there is still a high chance that the bank raises interest rates again next month.\u201d ING\u2019s Viraj Patel points out that weaker inflation might make two rate hikes in 2018 less likely: The pound is continuing to slide, as traders ponder what this morning\u2019s drop in inflation means for UK interest rates. Sterling has now fallen by a whole cent against the US dollar, to $1.419. It\u2019s also down 0.7% against the euro, to \u20ac1.147. At the start of this week, a May rate hike looked to be nailed on. But the news that the Consumer Prices Index has fallen back towards the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target is prompting a rethink. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool suspects that the BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee might vote for a rate hike, to 0.75%.... but he also thinks it would be a mistake. He tells us: Despite the drop in inflation, I still suspect MPC members might hike. After all they have done it in the past: From my database, MPC members voted in July 2007 for a hike (to 5.75%) despite CPI inflation \u2018dropping like a stone\u2019 by recording three (!) successive falls from 3.1% in March 2007 to 2.8% in April, to 2.5% in May and to 2.4% in June 2007! But, they shouldn\u2019t as my colleague Michael Ellington from Liverpool University and I show in a brand new paper (available here) that interest rate hikes are more powerful in reducing inflation when inflation exceeds 3%. Far from a done deal next month\u2019s decision! However, Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, argues that the BoE should raise borrowing costs, as inflation is likely to remain above target this year. Though the impact of a weakened pound appears to be dropping out of the inflation numbers, three other factors are likely to exert an offsetting upward pressure on the pace of price increases. Productivity growth remains sluggish, with GDP rising not much above the rate of employment growth. Wage increases are also picking up - and could easily reach 3%per annum in the second half of this year. In addition, a buoyant global economy is likely to continue to push up food and energy prices, with the oil price now already above $70/barrel. \u201cThe Bank of England should not therefore treat this latest fallback in inflation as a dovish signal for interest rate policy. The MPC\u2019s approach has normally been to look through short-term fluctuations and focus on the longer term influences on the inflation outlook. With unemployment at its lowest level since the mid-1970s, continued UK economic growth, a strong global economy, and inflation likely to remain above-target, there is still a very strong case for a rise in interest rates to 0.75% at next month\u2019s MPC meeting.\u201d So, next month\u2019s Bank of England meeting - on 10th May - will be rather exciting.... There\u2019s no inflation in London\u2019s property market right now. Instead, house prices in the capital have fallen by 1% year-on-year -- the first annual decline since 2009 (when Britain was in recession). This makes London the only region where house prices have dropped in the last year; on average, UK house prices rose by 4.4% in the year to February. The Office for National Statistics blames the decline on the increase on stamp duty on more expensive houses, and the long-running affordability challenge with buying a house in London. It says: This is the lowest annual growth in London since September 2009, when it was negative 3.2%. London has shown a general slowdown in its annual growth rate since mid-2016. The second-lowest annual growth was in Yorkshire and The Humber, where prices increased by 3.1% in the year to February 2018. At \u00a3472,000, the average London house price is more than double the UK average (\u00a3225,000). Inflation across the eurozone has risen, but by less than expected. Figures just released by Eurostat show that prices in the euro area rose by 1.3% per year last month. That\u2019s up from February\u2019s 1.1%, but weaker than expected (\u2018flash data\u2019 suggested a rise of 1.4%, closer to the ECB\u2019s target of almost 2%). Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, is urging the Bank of England not to raise borrowing costs next month: \u201cWages are still worth less than before the financial crisis, leaving many working people struggling to get by. A hike in interest rates is the last thing they need, and the fall in inflation shows the Bank of England should hold off. Tej Parikh, Senior Economist at the Institute of Directors, says the drop in inflation could spur growth in the UK economy: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show a significant drop in inflation, and it is expected to continue to fall over the course of this year. This will be welcomed by the business community who have seen high inflation act as a major speed bump on economic growth ever since the beginning of last year. The drop in inflation will also offer much-needed breathing space for households who have been wedged between weak wage growth and rising price levels, which in turn will hopefully bolster consumer confidence and sales activity. The drop in Britain\u2019s inflation rate is welcome news for UK households. Many have suffered a cost of living squeeze, as wages failed to keep pace with the cost of living for the last year. Philip Smeaton, chief investment officer at wealth manager Sanlam UK, points out that the jump in inflation last year forced many people deeper into debt: \u201cWith inflation falling back towards the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target and wage growth overtaking inflation for the first time in over a year, it finally looks like the squeeze on living is easing. These positive signs of a strengthening economy could be all the Bank of England needs to pull the interest rate lever in May \u2013 moving policy back towards monetary normalisation. However, the MPC should consider what impact this could have on consumer debt. Since the shock vote to leave the EU, consumers have continued to spend despite immense pressure on their pockets \u2013 meaning they have likely accumulated debt. Should too much pressure be applied through higher interest rates this could impact consumers ability to spend, which is a vital element of the UK economy.\u201d Alistair Wilson, Head of Retail Platform Strategy at Zurich, points out that savers have also found times tough: \u201cWhile households can breathe a sigh of relief thanks to another easing of inflationary pressures, family disposable income remains squeezed, particularly after the news that disposable income has fallen for the first time in six years. Even with the inevitable rate rise, it\u2019s clear that more needs to be done to help make what little savings people can afford to put away, go that bit further. This is the first time since summer 2015 that Britain\u2019s inflation rate has fallen for two months running. The inflationary impact of the pound\u2019s slump, after the EU referendum, seems to be fading. Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, explains: \u201cCPI is at its lowest in a year and March\u2019s decline is the 2nd consecutive month of weaker price rises \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen that since August \u2013 September 2015. The majority of the slip is courtesy of the continual pricing out of the devaluation of sterling post the EU referendum, lower clothing prices as well as idiosyncratic changes courtesy of the rescheduling of the Budget until Autumn.\u201d The absence of new \u2018sin taxes\u2019 on booze and cigarettes this spring helped to keep inflation down (because the government has moved the annual Budget statement to the autumn). Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the Office for National Statistics, says: \u201cInflation fell to its lowest rate in a year, with women\u2019s clothing prices rising slower than usual for this time of year. \u201cAlcohol and tobacco also helped ease inflation pressures, with tobacco duty rises linked to the Budget not appearing this March, thanks to its new autumn billing. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, says the drop in inflation undermines the case for raising UK interest rates next month: The TUC agrees: The pound is sliding, as the City of London reacts to March\u2019s unexpectedly weak inflation figures. Sterling has dropped by three quarters of a cent against the US dollar to $1.42. Tat shows that traders think a May interest rate rise is now less likely. If inflation is falling back towards the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, then the central bank might decide to leave borrowing costs unchanged. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s inflation rate has fallen to 2.5%, a one-year low. That\u2019s down from 2.7% in February, and another sign that the cost of living crisis is easing, given that wages are currently rising at 2.8%. The Office for National Statistics says: The largest downward contribution to the change in the rate between February 2018 and March 2018 came from prices for clothing and footwear rising by less than they did a year ago, with the effect coming mainly from a range of items of women\u2019s clothing. Price movements for alcoholic drinks and tobacco also made a downward contribution to the change in the rate; this in part reflects changes to the Budget cycle that were introduced in 2017, with tax changes for tobacco being announced in November 2017 instead of March 2018. More to follow! The Unite union are demanding answers from De La Rue, following its decision not to appeal over the UK passport contract. Here\u2019s Tony Burke, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary. After a strong run, European car sales have suffered their biggest fall in five years. New car registrations across the EU fell by 5.2% in March, new figures show, driven by drops in the UK, Germany and Italy. Industry body ACEA, which compiled the data, warns: \u201cMomentum is starting to slow in some markets and especially in the United Kingdom.\u201d It could be another sign that growth in the eurozone economy is slowing, after a strong 2017. Bloomberg says: Auto sales dropped in March at eight of the 10 top-selling carmaking groups, with the steepest declines at Ford Motor Co., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, BMW AG and Nissan Motor Co. A planned merger to create Britain\u2019s biggest property company has been abandoned, in the face of UK retail gloom. Hammerson, which owns Bicester Village and Birmingham\u2019s Bullring, has ditched its takeover of smaller rival INTU, which owns a string of shopping centres around the UK. Hammerson walked away after concluding that the deal was too risky, given the weakness in the UK retail sector at present. It says: The Board of Hammerson reassessed the proposed acquisition of Intu in light of updated information on current market dynamics in the UK. Over the last five months, the financial strength of retailers and other tenants in the UK has softened and a number of retailers have entered into administrations or CVAs, while consumer confidence has also remained subdued. It\u2019s an embarrassing u-turn for the company, which really ought to have spotted such problems in its own sector. But given the recent collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin, and profit warnings at Debenhams and Mothercare, it also feels like the right decision. Shares in Hammerson have risen by almost 3% this morning, while Intu have slumped almost 6%. There are red faces at banknote printer De La Rue this morning, as it counts the cost of the \u2018Brexit blue passport\u2019 farrago. De La Rue has abandoned its attempt to appeal against the decision to award the contract to print Britain\u2019s new passports to French-Dutch rival Gemalto. In an unscheduled announcement to the City, De La Rue hit shareholders with a profits warning - the second in a month - and revealed it is taking a \u00a34m hit on the UK passport contract. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The company, which also makes the new polymer bank notes, warned that underlying operating profit was now expected to be in low to mid \u00a360m range for the year to 31 March. It followed a profits warning less than month ago, when De La Rue predicted profits of between \u00a371m and \u00a373m. The firm said the lower profits expectation reflected \u201cthe write off of the [about] \u00a34m bid costs related to the UK passport tender and delays in the shipment of certain contracts in the last week of the period\u201d. Shares in De La Rue have fallen 5% in early trading. Today\u2019s UK inflation report could send traders racing to buy, or sell, the British pound. It all depend whether the data make an early interest rate rise more likely, as Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADS Securities, explains: Inflation in Britain is one of the key data investors and traders are following as it relates to how fast and aggressively the Bank of England will hike rates. We know that the BoE want to raise their key interest rate levels during their next two meetings but the actual timing of the move is still under debate. The pound\u2019s price action largely depends on when market participants believe the British central bank will pull the trigger and the pace of inflation is key in gauging when this will be. The pound is trading at $1.429 this morning - a weak inflation report could send it sliding to $1.425, Anthis says. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Inflation is centre-stage today as we find out how the cost of living changed in the UK and the eurozone last month. Britain\u2019s consumer prices index is tipped to come in around 2.7% in March, matching February\u2019s reading and away from January\u2019s 3% peak. If so, that would confirm that the cost of living squeeze is easing - yesterday we learned that UK wages rose by 2.8% in the last quarter. The data may also influence the chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates next month, which has already driven the pound to 22-month highs yesterday. Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s analysts predict that inflation might actually drop to 2.6% today, given the recent easing in petrol prices. They add: The recently announced price increases by British Gas, of 5.5% for both gas and electricity, don\u2019t take effect until the end of May so won\u2019t have any impact on the forthcoming release, however, in the second half of 2018, factoring in this utility bill hike will add an estimated 0.05-0.1ppts to annual CPI rates. It remains to be seen whether other energy providers follow British Gas, but in any case it reaffirms expectations that inflation will remain above the 2% target into 2019. Inflation is rather lower in the eurozone, of course. The annual euro area consumer prices index is expected to remain at 1.4% for March, although prices probably picked up during the month. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: Today\u2019s inflation data from the eurozone could show signs of a pickup having been lacklustre for the past year. Whilst CPI is forecast to be 1.4% on an annualised basis, on a monthly basis an uptick to 1% from 0.2% is forecast. Weak eurozone inflation is great for consumers in the region, of course, but it could also make it harder for the European Central Bank to end its massive money-printing Quantitative Easing stimulus programme this autumn. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s Spring Meeting is continuing in Washington; two new reports on the state of the global economy will be released later. Plus, the Bank of Canada is setting interest rates today; it\u2019s likely to leave borrowing costs unchanged at 1.25%.

Productivity growth remains sluggish, with GDP rising not much above the rate of employment growth. Wage increases are also picking up - and could easily reach 3%per annum in the second half of this year.</p> <p>In addition, a buoyant global economy is likely to continue to push up food and energy prices, with the oil price now already above $70/barrel.</p> <p>\u201cThe Bank of England should not therefore treat this latest fallback in inflation as a dovish signal for interest rate policy. The MPC\u2019s approach has normally been to look through short-term fluctuations and focus on the longer term influences on the inflation outlook. With unemployment at its lowest level since the mid-1970s, continued UK economic growth, a strong global economy, and inflation likely to remain above-target, there is still a very strong case for a rise in interest rates to 0.75% at next month\u2019s MPC meeting.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>So, next month\u2019s Bank of England meeting - on 10th May - will be rather exciting....</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BruceReuters/status/986537044796215296\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Looking at reactions to today&#39;s CPI, fair to say most economists think the BoE will press on with a May rate hike, despite weaker-than-expected inflation and so-so wage growth.<br><br>But among some of them, certainly a pang of... <a href=\"https://t.co/RBJfN4D1SH\">pic.twitter.com/RBJfN4D1SH</a></p>&mdash; Andy Bruce (@BruceReuters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BruceReuters/status/986537044796215296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 18, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-18T10:18:25.247Z\">at 11.18am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ad70f9de4b0d4b06ccb4e8d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-18T09:36:49.691Z\">10.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">London house prices fall for first time since 2009</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There\u2019s no inflation in London\u2019s property market right now.</strong></p> <p>Instead, house prices in the capital have fallen by 1% year-on-year -- the first annual decline since 2009 (when Britain was in recession).</p> <p>This makes London the only region where house prices have dropped in the last year; on average, UK house prices rose by 4.4% in the year to February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"070f4fc8e28e5bf6c03772a79b4d69c9ff978790\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/070f4fc8e28e5bf6c03772a79b4d69c9ff978790/0_0_678_500/500.png\" alt=\"London house prices\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London house prices</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobleFrancis/status/986524448953192448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ONS/Land Registry average house inflation in the year to February 2018 by region.

However, the MPC should consider what impact this could have on consumer debt.

      "bodyText": "The global economy is more deeply indebted than before the financial crisis and countries need to take immediate action to improve their finances before the next downturn, the International Monetary Fund has said. The IMF said a prolonged period of low interest rates had stimulated a build-up of debt worth 225% of world GDP in 2016, 12 points above the previous record level reached in 2009. China was responsible for much of the increase, the IMF said, but noted that developed, emerging market and low-income countries all now looked vulnerable. The Washington-based institution used its half-yearly fiscal monitor to single out the US for particular criticism, saying that Donald Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus \u2013 a package of tax cuts and spending increases \u2013 was leading to a bigger budget deficit at a time when it should be on the way down. Growth in the global economy is expected to be 3.9% in both 2018 and 2019, but the IMF thinks the better-than-predicted performance will not last and that countries that reduce budget deficits now will be best placed when tougher times arrive. \u201cDecisive action is needed now to strengthen fiscal buffers, taking full advantage of the cyclical upswing in economic activity,\u201d the fund said. \u201cIt is important to note that building buffers now will help protect the economy, both by creating room for fiscal policy to step in to support economic activity during a downturn and by reducing the risk of financing difficulties if global financial conditions tighten suddenly.\u201d The IMF said the biggest emerging market economy, China, had alone been responsible for more than 40% of the increase in global debt since 2007. It added that debt levels across emerging markets as a whole now averaged 50% of GDP, their highest level since the 1980s, the decade marked by the Latin American debt crisis. The world\u2019s poorest countries had their debts largely written off as a result of the Gleneagles agreement of 2005, but the IMF said debt-to-GDP ratios were once again on the rise and were now above 40% of GDP. Nearly half of the debt is on non-concessional terms, which has resulted in a doubling of the interest burden as a share of tax revenues in the past 10 years. V\u00edtor Gaspar, the IMF\u2019s director of fiscal affairs, said that since the debt write-offs, debt levels had been picking up and had risen by 13 percentage points of GDP in the past five years. Many poor countries in Africa borrowed heavily when commodity prices were high only to face difficulties when the market for their exports crashed. \u201cOur debt sustainability analyses indicate that 40% of low-income countries are currently at high risk of or already in debt distress. It doubled in five years,\u201d Gaspar said. \u201cFurthermore, debt service has also been rising rapidly, particularly in countries with high inflation rates. The interest burden has also doubled, in the past 10 years, to 20 percent of taxes.\u201d The World Bank offers low-income countries interest-free or cheap loans, but Gaspar said much of the increase in interest-rate burdens reflected a growing tendency to borrow from the private capital markets. Gaspar rejected Trump\u2019s argument that the extra growth generated by the US fiscal stimulus will pay for itself. \u201cThese measures will give rise to overall deficits above $1tn over the next three years, which is more than 5% of GDP. Debt is projected to increase from 108% in 2017 to 117% of GDP in 2023. If tax cuts with sunset provisions are not allowed to lapse, public debt would climb even higher. \u201cWe urge policymakers to avoid pro-cyclical policy actions that provide unnecessary stimulus when economic activity is already pacing up. \u201cThe economic upswing should be used to accumulate fiscal buffers for tempestuous times that will eventually come.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The funeral provider Dignity said business was better than expected during the first three months of the year as the number of deaths rose and more people chose premium funerals. Shares jumped 16% after the undertaker said a greater-than-expected proportion of customers were still choosing the more expensive full funeral service, even though a price war in the industry resulted in the group slashing the price of its cheapest funerals in January. Dignity, which has 800 funeral homes, cut the average price of its simple funeral service by 26% to \u00a31,995 in England and Wales and to \u00a31,695 in Scotland, and had expected the proportion of customers choosing this option to rise from 7% to about 20%. However, in a trading update for the first quarter of 2018, the company said the rise had been limited to 15%, as more people still preferred a full-service funeral, costing an average of \u00a33,800. The simple option includes a basic coffin and a limited choice on the date and time of a funeral, whereas the more expensive plan includes the option to upgrade the casket, limousine hire and access to the chapel of rest outside normal office hours. Meanwhile, the number of deaths in the UK increased by 8% to 181,000 between January and March, up from 167,000 over the first three months of 2017 and driving the number of Dignity funerals higher. \u201cIt continues to be a very competitive market and we\u2019ve responded to that by cutting our prices the way we have,\u201d Mike McCollum, the chief executive of Dignity, said. \u201cOverall it\u2019s a positive start to the year and better than people were expecting.\u201d The favourable start to the year drove revenues in the first quarter of 2018 to \u00a395m, \u00a32m more than in the same period of 2017. Earnings of \u00a337.5m were roughly unchanged but significantly better than the board was expecting. McCollum said Dignity was still exploring ways to provide the best mix of funerals available to customers, including the possibility of offering a mid-range service that was more expensive than the simple service but cheaper than the full service. \u201cThere are a few changes still to come. During 2018 our objective is to really understand the best relationships between the price, volumes of customers and how much we spend on promotions.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "De La Rue\u2019s explanation of why it now accepts defeat in the contest to print the UK\u2019s post-Brexit blue passport is feeble. Apparently, the company has engaged in intense consideration for the past four weeks and received clear legal advice. Come on. Five minutes of casual reflection in the boardroom a month ago should have been enough to recognise the reality of the situation. The bid from Gemalto, the Franco-Dutch rival, was \u00a3120m lower than De La Rue\u2019s over the 11-year contract, so the UK government was never likely to perform a protectionist U-turn that would have made a nonsense of ministers\u2019 rhetoric about the UK being open for business after Brexit. A pause for thought might also have saved Martin Sutherland, De La Rue\u2019s chief executive, from making himself look a fool. Sutherland started the process of working the nation, or part of it, into a fine frenzy last month by grumbling about how it was terribly unfair that Gemalto had got the gig. He challenged the prime minister to visit De La Rue\u2019s factory in Gateshead to explain to workers why she thought it sensible \u201cto offshore the manufacture of a British icon\u201d. Now, after talking up the prospects of an appeal, he\u2019s capitulated. Bidding for contracts, and sometimes losing, is deemed to be part of the rough and tumble of business. As for the threat to jobs in Gateshead, Sutherland points out that the current contract with the Passport Office has another 18 months to run, which leaves plenty of time to find alternative contracts to fill the gap. The government\u2019s position has been more clear-sighted from the outset. This was an open competitive tender. Quality was prioritised and the savings from Gemalto\u2019s bid were substantial. The new supplier already produces UK driving licences. Some of the new passports will be produced by Gemalto in its factories in Britain. Sutherland, one must assume, was hoping that the bizarre excitement over the return of the blue(ish) passports would somehow override the extra costs to taxpayers. For a company that boasts about its global footprint and work with governments, central banks and commercial organisations in over 140 countries, it was the wrong card to play. It is equally odd that Labour shadow ministers, from Keir Starmer to Diane Abbott, thought it wise to back a doomed campaign to impose extra costs on the public purse for the sake of symbolism. There are interventionist industrial causes that are worth backing. This was not one. Hammerson pair in last chance saloon In a strong day for corporate about-turns, Hammerson abandoned its \u00a33.4bn bid for its shopping centre rival Intu, more than four months after terms were agreed. The target squealed about the explanations being unsatisfactory and, strictly speaking, Intu has a point. The Hammerson chairman, David Tyler, and the chief executive, David Atkins, were banging on about how they were fully committed to the deal a month ago. For practical purposes, though, Intu shouldn\u2019t waste its breath. This deal has been dying for weeks, for the reason given in my previous column: too many Hammerson shareholders hate it. They didn\u2019t want an acquisition that involved printing new shares at a heavy discount to asset value to buy an Intu estate they regard as inferior. The heaviest blow was struck by the Dutch pension fund APG, Hammerson\u2019s second biggest shareholder, which said last week it would vote its 7% stake against the deal. Even JO Hambro, with a 1.8% holding and trying to sound supportive of the board, could only rouse itself to say it was not negative on the Intu idea, which was some way short of being a positive endorsement. Hambro\u2019s stance, however, suggests heads won\u2019t roll. The Intu saga, interrupted by the brief excitement of French group\u2019s Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s bid approach to Hammerson, has embarrassed Tyler and Atkins, but they\u2019ll probably be allowed to attempt a plan B. So far, that involves reassessing \u201cthe optimal portfolio mix\u201d and accelerating the delivery of value to shareholders, which is far too woolly to be useful. But at least the pair appear to realise they are in the last chance saloon. Poor excuse over timing of another M&amp;S departure Another reason for executives to avoid Twitter. Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne contrived to announce his departure as Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s marketing chief before the company had made its formal stock exchange announcement, which is procedural no-no for a main board director. Nobody really cares because management rejigs at M&amp;S arrive at a rate of about one a week these days, but Bousquet-Chavanne\u2019s excuse was particularly poor. He was in Spain and didn\u2019t take account of the time difference.",

Apparently, the company has engaged in intense consideration for the past four weeks and received clear legal advice. Come on. Five minutes of casual reflection in the boardroom a month ago should have been enough to recognise the reality of the situation.</p> <p>The bid from Gemalto, the Franco-Dutch rival, was \u00a3120m lower than De La Rue\u2019s over the 11-year contract, so the UK government was never likely to perform a protectionist U-turn that would have made a nonsense of ministers\u2019 rhetoric about the UK being open for business after Brexit. A pause for thought might also have saved Martin Sutherland, De La Rue\u2019s chief executive, from making himself look a fool.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/18/de-la-rue-drops-passport-appeal-issues-profit-warning\">De La Rue drops passport appeal and issues profit warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sutherland started the process of working the nation, or part of it, into a fine frenzy last month by grumbling about how it was terribly unfair that Gemalto had got the gig. He challenged the prime minister to visit De La Rue\u2019s factory in Gateshead to explain to workers why she thought it sensible \u201cto offshore the manufacture of a British icon\u201d.</p> <p>Now, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/02/post-brexit-passports-contract-de-la-rue-to-appeal-against-decision\">talking up the prospects</a> of an appeal, he\u2019s capitulated. Bidding for contracts, and sometimes losing, is deemed to be part of the rough and tumble of business. As for the threat to jobs in Gateshead, Sutherland points out that the current contract with the Passport Office has another 18 months to run, which leaves plenty of time to find alternative contracts to fill the gap.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The government\u2019s position has been more clear-sighted from the outset. This was an open competitive tender. Quality was prioritised and the savings from Gemalto\u2019s bid were substantial. The new supplier already produces UK driving licences. Some of the new passports will be produced by Gemalto in its factories in Britain.</p> <p>Sutherland, one must assume, was hoping that the bizarre excitement over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/22/british-passports-will-be-navy-blue-after-brexit-says-home-office\">return of the blue(ish) passports</a> would somehow override the extra costs to taxpayers. For a company that boasts about its global footprint and work with governments, central banks and commercial organisations in over 140 countries, it was the wrong card to play.</p> <p>It is equally odd that Labour shadow ministers, from Keir Starmer to Diane Abbott, thought it wise to back a doomed campaign to impose extra costs on the public purse for the sake of symbolism. There are interventionist industrial causes that are worth backing. This was not one.</p> <h2>Hammerson pair in last chance saloon</h2> <p>In a strong day for corporate about-turns, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/18/hammerson-abandons-planned-34bn-buyout-of-rival-intu\">Hammerson abandoned its \u00a33.4bn bid for its shopping centre rival Intu</a>, more than four months after terms were agreed. The target squealed about the explanations being unsatisfactory and, strictly speaking, Intu has a point. The Hammerson chairman, David Tyler, and the chief executive, David Atkins, were banging on about how they were fully committed to the deal a month ago.</p> <p>For practical purposes, though, Intu shouldn\u2019t waste its breath. This deal has been dying for weeks, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/apr/18/is-primarks-owner-too-big-and-diverse-to-fail-possibly\">for the reason given in my previous column</a>: too many Hammerson shareholders hate it. They didn\u2019t want an acquisition that involved printing new shares at a heavy discount to asset value to buy an Intu estate they regard as inferior.</p> <p>The heaviest blow was struck by the Dutch pension fund APG, Hammerson\u2019s second biggest shareholder, which said last week it would vote its 7% stake against the deal. Even JO Hambro, with a 1.8% holding and trying to sound supportive of the board, could only rouse itself to say it was not negative on the Intu idea, which was some way short of being a positive endorsement.</p> <p>Hambro\u2019s stance, however, suggests heads won\u2019t roll. The Intu saga, interrupted by the brief excitement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/13/klepierre-walks-away-from-5bn-offer-for-hammerson\">French group\u2019s Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s bid approach to Hammerson</a>, has embarrassed Tyler and Atkins, but they\u2019ll probably be allowed to attempt a plan B. So far, that involves reassessing \u201cthe optimal portfolio mix\u201d and accelerating the delivery of value to shareholders, which is far too woolly to be useful. But at least the pair appear to realise they are in the last chance saloon.</p> <h2>Poor excuse over timing of another M&amp;S departure</h2> <p>Another reason for executives to avoid Twitter. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/18/patrick-bousquet-chevanne-marks-spencer-marketing-boss-depart-management-shakeup\">Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne contrived to announce his departure as Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s marketing chief</a> before the company had made its formal stock exchange announcement, which is procedural no-no for a main board director.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Nobody really cares because management rejigs at M&amp;S arrive at a rate of about one a week these days, but Bousquet-Chavanne\u2019s excuse was particularly poor. He was in Spain and didn\u2019t take account of the time difference.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The board of Hammerson, the owner of Birmingham\u2019s Bullring shopping centre, has abandoned its planned buyout of smaller rival Intu, the company behind Manchester\u2019s Trafford centre. After weeks of pressure from shareholders, Hammerson\u2019s directors said they believed the \u00a33.4bn deal with Intu was \u201cno longer in the best interests of shareholders\u201d, blaming a deterioration in the British retail property market and concerns about a lengthy merger process. The deal is now unlikely to go ahead but Hammerson can only advise shareholders to vote against it as it cannot formally withdraw at this stage without agreement from Intu. Intu\u2019s board said it would consider a request from Hammerson not to convene a shareholders\u2019 meeting to vote on the merger. No date has been set for a vote because Hammerson delayed publication of documents relating to the acquisition earlier this month after receiving a takeover approach from the French shopping centre firm Kl\u00e9pierre. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, described the about turn by Hammerson\u2019s board on the Intu deal as \u201cembarrassing\u201d. The move comes after a series of mass store closures by retailers including New Look and Toys R Us, with more planned by Carpetright, Mothercare and Homebase. David Atkins, the chief executive of Hammerson, said: \u201cIt is clear that the heightened risks to the Intu acquisition now outweigh the longer-term benefits. We have a clear strategy that has delivered consistent, strong returns on a standalone basis.\u201d Hammerson\u2019s share price has fallen by 5.4% since the December announcement of the proposed tie-up with Intu as well as the collapse of the takeover approach from Kl\u00e9pierre. The French company ditched its takeover plans last week after Hammerson\u2019s board rejected its \u00a35.04bn offer as \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d. In an announcement to the stock market about the Intu deal on Wednesday, Hammerson said it \u201chas proven its portfolio is well positioned to weather the current environment\u201d but \u201cthe equity market now perceives a heightened level of risk associated with the UK retail property sector as a whole\u201d. It added that \u201cextensive engagement\u201d with shareholders, particularly in recent weeks, had revealed a \u201cwide range of views on the merits of the Intu acquisition\u201d. Intu said it regarded Hammerson\u2019s explanations for withdrawing its backing for the merger as unsatisfactory, adding that it had been pursuing the deal in good faith since its announcement on 6 December last year. \u201cThe board of Intu is entirely confident of Intu\u2019s commercial future and prospects,\u201d it said, adding that a trading update issued on Tuesday had \u201cunderlined the key strengths of Intu\u2019s business\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The British printing firm that lost out on \u00a3490m contract to make the post-Brexit blue passport is dropping an appeal against the decision, less than a month after the firm\u2019s boss vowed to fight the government. De La Rue said it had made the \u201cpragmatic business decision\u201d after taking legal advice and having \u201cconsidered all options\u201d. The company, which prints the current burgundy passport as well as bank notes, said it remained surprised and disappointed by the decision to award the new contract to the Franco-Dutch company Gemalto. However, chief executive Martin Sutherland, said on Wednesday: \u201cWe\u2019ve done our homework ... on balance it looked unlikely that we\u2019d get this overturned. \u201cAs a business we have to act in the interests of our staff, on behalf of our customers, of our shareholders and we have to focus our efforts and energies elsewhere. It\u2019s a slightly disappointing outcome but that\u2019s just the rough and tumble of business.\u201d When it emerged last month that the government had picked De La Rue\u2019s foreign rival for the blue passport contract, Sutherland said he would appeal the decision and challenged the prime minister to \u201ccome to my factory and explain my dedicated workforce why they think this is a sensible decision to offshore the manufacture of a British icon\u201d. Unite, Britain\u2019s largest union, said De La Rue\u2019s decision to abandon an appeal would come as \u201ca bitter blow\u201d to its workers, who face an uncertain future. The company employs 600 people at its printing factory in Gateshead, with about 100 of those thought to be employed in the passport division. \u201cWorkers will feel let down that the company is not prepared to fight the government\u2019s decision to ship the production of the new blue passport overseas,\u201d said Louisa Bull, a Unite national officer. \u201cFor the past decade, De La Rue has produced the UK\u2019s passports securely without any problems and provided a source of decent, well-paid jobs in the north-east. \u201cTheresa May and her government is now putting all that at risk with little thought of the consequences or the shockwaves that it will send through the community and local economy.\u201d Sutherland said that no decision had been made about the jobs in Gateshead and that the firm was hoping to win other contracts to make up for the lost UK passport work. \u201cWe have the [existing passport contract] for another 18 months. That gives us plenty of time to take stock, refocus and drive forward on the international front so we haven\u2019t made any decisions about jobs in Gateshead. That gives us plenty of time to find alternative contracts to fill the gap.\u201d At the same time as it announced it was dropping the appeal, De La Rue issued its second profit warning in a month, blaming \u00a34m of costs associated with bidding for the passport contract, as well as delays in the shipment of certain contracts. The company said underlying operating profit was expected to be in the low-to-mid-\u00a360m range for the year to 31 March. A few weeks ago, De La Rue had predicted profit of between \u00a371m and \u00a373m. De La Rue is more than 200 years old and employs around 3,150 people worldwide. In the UK, the company has contracts with the Bank of England, Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland to produce the newer polymer bank notes. It also prints money for Fiji, the Maldives, Qatar, Kuwait, the Bahamas and the Seychelles, among others.",

      "bodyText": "If Associated British Foods didn\u2019t have a controlling shareholder, an uppity US hedge fund would probably have demanded the company be split into pieces years ago. Whitbread is somehow deemed offensively diverse because it owns Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, but take a look at AB Foods\u2019 portfolio: it runs from sugar production around the globe, takes in grocery brands such as Twinings, Ovaltine and Kingsmill, and has spawned discount clothing chain Primark. Outside shareholders should give thanks for the refusal to bend to the demand for focus. Primark, one suspects, wouldn\u2019t be the same conquering force without AB Foods\u2019 willingness to experiment slowly, a quality that may flow from the 54.5% ownership by Wittington Investments, itself controlled by the charitable Garfield Weston Foundation. These days, Primark contributes just over half the group\u2019s operating profits: \u00a3341m out of \u00a3648m at the half-year stage. Primark\u2019s astonishing run hasn\u2019t stopped the City fretting on two fronts. First, there is the worry that the chain\u2019s refusal to sell online is a historic mistake. Second, is expansion into the US, graveyard of British retailers, a step too far? Amid the general gloominess about retailers, AB Foods\u2019 share price had fallen by a fifth in six months before Tuesday\u2019s 4% bounce. The US concern won\u2019t be answered quickly since some of the nine stores in the north-east have been open for less than a year. The company admits it is still tweaking ranges to improve sales densities. But the news that Primark is already looking to open a store in Florida suggests something is going right in the US. As for the supposed threat from online rivals, it\u2019s hard to spot. Like-for-like for sales fell 1.5%, not helped by cold European weather, but the UK was up 3%. Between sermons on the effect on sugar prices from the end of EU quotas, management offered a persuasive argument that pinging promotional videos across Instagram is a smarter way to drive Primark sales than shouldering the distribution costs of an online shop. The store-only logic probably only applies at the cut-price end of the clothing market and, eventually, even Primark may have to rethink. But there\u2019s currently no reason to mess with a formula that, even in a soft half-year, produced a profit margin of almost 10%. Most of the online-only brigade would love that. Intu takeover: time to call it off? Sadly for Intu, the shopping centre group, there aren\u2019t more Primarks. If there were, the owner of Lakeside and Trafford Centre wouldn\u2019t have felt obliged to make an extended plea that everything in the world of malls is lovely, despite the rise of Amazon and the troubles of the likes of New Look, Toys R Us and Prezzo. The point of the breathless release about \u201crecord retail demand\u201d and \u201cincreased rents\u201d in its centres, one assumes, was to try to convince Hammerson not to walk away from its \u00a33.4bn bid for Intu. That cause isn\u2019t completely hopeless since Hammerson chairman David Tyler would happily seal the deal if he had a free hand. He shares the view that good shopping centres have a decent future. The trouble is, Tyler and Hammerson\u2019s board must know their adventure is in deep trouble. Dutch pension fund group APG, the second-biggest shareholder in Hammerson with a 7% stake, is opposed to the Intu purchase and it won\u2019t be alone. Put simply, many Hammerson investors think their own company\u2019s assets, including Brent Cross and Birmingham Bullring, are superior to Intu\u2019s estate with its rump of smaller centres. They can\u2019t see the appeal of diluting the mix via an all-share takeover. Tyler &amp; co were right to reject the under-priced approach for Hammerson itself from French group Kl\u00e9pierre, but their shareholders\u2019 patience is wearing thin. If Intu won\u2019t renegotiate terms, call the whole thing off. Time for a new broom at WPP? None of the names being thrown around as a potential next chief executive for WPP sounds worth a bet. Jeremy Darroch of Sky? Why would he want it? He\u2019s made a fortune at Sky and untangling Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s creation would be a very different gig. Adam Crozier, lately of ITV and once of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, seems happy on the non-executive circuit. Andrew Robertson, chief of advertising agency BBDO, has been floated, but importing a long-serving big name from a direct rival would be risky at a company with a culture as distinct as WPP\u2019s. Almost by default, an internal pick \u2013 with Mark Read, one of the stand-in chief operating officers, the obvious name \u2013 starts as favourite. But one suspects shareholders would prefer an outsider with zero attachment to WPP\u2019s current structure.",

      "bodyText": "The Turnbull government plans to overhaul the lending rules of the $5bn Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility to make it much easier to finance major projects that have struggled to attract commercial lenders. Matt Canavan, the resources and northern Australia minister, said the Naif was only allowed to provide 50% of an infrastructure project\u2019s total debt, and that was too restrictive. The government would remove that cap to allow the commonwealth to take on 100% of the debt risk of major projects. Project proponents would still have to repay the loan, but the Naif would be able to provide the larger finance on concessional terms, he said. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Canavan said the government would also make it easier for Naif to finance a larger range of projects by redefining the term \u201cinfrastructure\u201d. It would also loosen the \u201cgap test\u201d which confines the Naif to funding projects that would not have gone ahead without Naif assistance. The changes would make the Naif more flexible, and help drive investment in northern Australia where there was often little infrastructure, he said. Canavan said the Naif was established in 2015 with some arbitrary rules that had since proved too restrictive, so it made sense to reform some. Since 2015, one project has been approved, 17 are going through a due diligence process and 90 are being considered across Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. \u201cOver the last two years we have attracted a lot of interest for a strong pipeline of projects but it has been challenging to get them to financial close,\u201d Canavan told ABC radio on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s why some of these rules are being changed to allow more commercial footing for the Naif to operate, and to bring what are some good projects in the pipeline to financial close.\u201d The changes will not make it easier for Naif to fund the controversial Adani Carmichael mine in Queensland because the Palaszczuk government has the power to veto its funding. The key changes were recommended by a review by the businessman Tony Shepherd. LNP senator Ian Macdonald welcomed the announcement. \u201cThere will no longer be a need to prove that other finance was not available and the non-binding cap of $50m will be scrapped,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition there will be a change of definition of what constitutes an infrastructure project, which will broaden the scope of investments which can be made. \u201cI am confident that many of the projects currently under consideration by the board of Naif will quickly be given the tick of approval once these changes are made.\u201d with Australian Associated Press",

Project proponents would still have to repay the loan, but the Naif would be able to provide the larger finance on concessional terms, he said. </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-au\">Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4150\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Guardian Today - Australia edition\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of editors' picks and the biggest headlines each afternoon.\" data-form-campaign-code=\"AU_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you our picks of the most important headlines tomorrow morning.\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Canavan said the government would also make it easier for Naif to finance a larger range of projects by redefining the term \u201cinfrastructure\u201d.</p> <p>It would also loosen the \u201cgap test\u201d which confines the Naif to funding projects that would not have gone ahead without Naif assistance.</p> <p>The changes would make the Naif more flexible, and help drive investment in northern Australia where there was often little infrastructure, he said.</p> <p>Canavan said the Naif was established in 2015 with some arbitrary rules that had since proved too restrictive, so it made sense to reform some.</p> <p>Since 2015, one project has been approved, 17 are going through a due diligence process and 90 are being considered across Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.</p> <p>\u201cOver the last two years we have attracted a lot of interest for a strong pipeline of projects but it has been challenging to get them to financial close,\u201d Canavan told ABC radio on Wednesday. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/17/northern-australia-infrastructure-facility-naif-may-be-investigated-by-auditor-general\">Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility may be investigated by auditor general</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why some of these rules are being changed to allow more commercial footing for the Naif to operate, and to bring what are some good projects in the pipeline to financial close.\u201d</p> <p>The changes will not make it easier for Naif to fund the controversial Adani Carmichael mine in Queensland because the Palaszczuk government has the power to veto its funding.</p> <p>The key changes were recommended by a review by the businessman Tony Shepherd.</p> <p>LNP senator Ian Macdonald welcomed the announcement. </p> <p>\u201cThere will no longer be a need to prove that other finance was not available and the non-binding cap of $50m will be scrapped,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition there will be a change of definition of what constitutes an infrastructure project, which will broaden the scope of investments which can be made.</p> <p>\u201cI am confident that many of the projects currently under consideration by the board of Naif will quickly be given the tick of approval once these changes are made.\u201d</p> <p><em>with Australian Associated Press</em></p>",
