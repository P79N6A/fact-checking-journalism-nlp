      "bodyText": "Just Eat, the online takeaway company, was on Wednesday night officially promoted into the FTSE 100 list of Britain\u2019s blue chip companies, with a valuation of \u00a35.5bn \u2013 making it worth half a billion pounds more than the UK\u2019s second biggest supermarket chain . The UK\u2019s love affair with having pizzas, curries and kebabs delivered to their door has spawned a mobile food business with no products and no outlets that is more highly valued than Sainsbury\u2019s, which sells 90,000 products through 1,400 stores \u2013 and also owns the Argos chain. Just Eat is also worth more than Morrisons and Marks &amp; Spencer. Little-known Danish technology entrepreneur Bo Bendtsen is the single-biggest shareholder in Just Eat with a 13% stake in the business now worth just over \u00a3730m. But Bendtsen, who had just 88 followers on Twitter at the time of writing, did not found the company, which provides takeaways to 19 million people. The man who came up with the idea was another Dane, Jesper Buch. He hit upon the idea of Just Eat when he was on a diplomatic internship in Norway in 2000 and set the company up with four friends in his basement. He sold his entire Just Eat stake to a private equity firm for \u00a33m in 2008. Buch\u2019s website \u2013 which highlights his personal mantra that he will do \u201cwhatever it fucking takes!\u201d to succeed, spent his windfall on an eight bedroom villa in Marbella complete with a heated outdoor pool, cinema and eight person jacuzzi. The villa is available to rent from \u00a36,700 a week. Bendtsen, who co-founded web-hosting company UK2 Group, bought into Just Eat in 2005 when Buch was raising funds to expand the company from Denmark to the UK. As well as providing a cash injection, Bendtsen lent his London flat to Buch and his team to use as a makeshift office. Bendtsen\u2019s initial stake in the company is unknown, but he realised \u00a387m when Just Eat floated in 2014 and still retained 23% of the shares. Bendtsen now holds 91m of Just Eat\u2019s shares through the Sara Marron discretionary settlement trust, which is the firm\u2019s biggest shareholder. A spokesman for the company confirmed that the trust is \u201cassociated with Bo Bendtsen, a Danish entrepreneur who was not a founder but one of the growth investors in Just Eat back in 2005\u201d. Buch, now 44, came up with the idea for Just Eat when he couldn\u2019t find a phone number online to order pizza when he was hungry in Olso. Realising there was a \u201cmassive gap in the market\u201d he created his own website which would list all nearby restaurants. He had hit on \u201cthe perfect business model\u201d, he told Money Week. \u201cI did not need to handle any product \u2013 I could just charge a commission for every transaction.\u201d Those commissions (13% for existing restaurants and 14% for newcomers, plus a \u00a3699 sign-up fee for restaurants joining the service) added up fast. The company now works with 28,000 restaurants in the UK, delivering more than 2m meals a week. It boasts that \u201cnobody offers more variety when it comes to bringing people food\u201d. After the UK, the business expanded into Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain and Switzerland. In the first nine months of this year sales were up 45% to \u00a3385m. The company expects to make profit in the region of \u00a3160m this year. It is still raising its profile, becoming the shirt sponsor at Derby County FC for three years and sponsoring the X-Factor in a \u00a310m deal. More than 800 of Just Eat\u2019s 2,500 staff from across the world (Sainsbury\u2019s, by comparison, has 195,000 staff) came together to celebrate the company\u2019s success last week by creating the world\u2019s biggest human image of a pizza. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you see a marketing assistant from Mexico dressed as a mushroom standing next to a territory manager from Italy dressed as a basil leaf,\u201d said Lisa Hillier, Just Eat\u2019s \u201cchief people officer\u201d. Just Eat has also launched the British Takeaway Awards. At a black tie ceremony held at London\u2019s Savoy hotel earlier this week John Bishop was handing out the awards including a takeaway of the year prize, which was won by Birmingham\u2019s Lime Pickle Indian. Watching the success of privately held Uber and Deliveroo, City investors have been piling in to Just Eat, sending the shares up from 260p when it floated on the stock market in 2014 to 799p on Wednesday night. That growth meant that it was admitted to the FTSE 100, alongside packaging company DS Smith and Halma, a technology company that makes smoke detectors. Those demoted from the corporate premier league were Madame Tussauds\u2019 owner Merlin Entertainments, engineer Babcock and medical company ConvaTec. Speaking about selling his stake in the company, Buch said he \u201cenjoyed creating and building a company, but the reality of managing it did not appeal\u201d. James Lockyer, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said the fact that Just Eat has overtaken Sainsbury\u2019s is further evidence of \u201cthe dramatic shift in the way we are leading our lives\u201d. \u201cWe are spending more and more time at work and we want to spend less time on boring things,\u201d Lockyer said. \u201cWe want to be satisfied instantly, it is the same with Netflix \u2013 we demand content now.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "EU rule capping bankers' bonuses 'could be scrapped after Brexit'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has raised the prospect that, after Brexit, the EU rule which puts a cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses could be scrapped. Mark Carney, a long-standing critic of the bonus rules, listed the cap as among the tweaks that could be made to financial regulations when the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. The bonus cap was introduced in January 2014 and was a reaction to the financial crisis when bankers received multi-million payouts despite huge losses. The cap limits payouts to 100% of salary or 200% with explicit approval from shareholders. Speaking at industry event in London, Carney also insisted that it was important to take a tough regulatory stance towards on the sector because it could double in size to around 20 times GDP in the next couple of decades. He indicated, though, that some tweaks could be made to EU rules. As well as the bonus cap, he pointed to rules that have an impact on smaller banks and ones which relate to insurance regulation as rules which could be revisited. \u201cThere are areas where we would make changes, but within the context of maintaining overall levels of resilience,\u201d Carney said. The cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses has caused controversy in the UK from the outset. When George Osborne was chancellor he lodged a complaint in the European court of justice to argue the cap would make the sector more risky but conceded defeat a year later. At the time Osborne had said \u201cthese are badly designed rules that are pushing up bankers\u2019 pay, not reducing it\u201d. Carney has also warned that the rules make it more difficult to penalise bankers, making it harder to cut bonuses for poor performance or misbehaviour. \u201cIt is unfortunate, for example, that new European rules to cap bonuses to half, or with shareholder approval, two-thirds, of total pay have the undesirable side effect of limiting the scope for remuneration to be cut back,\u201d the governor has said. An analysis in 2015 by the Bank on the bonus cap found that fixed pay \u2013 such as salaries and benefits \u2013 made up 50% of pay compared with 10% in 2010. This is because banks responded to the cap by introducing \u201callowances\u201d alongside salaries and bonuses to compensate for any fall in pay caused by the restriction. Chief executives of major UK banks now receive an award of shares in addition to bonuses. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, receives a \u201cfixed share award\u201d of \u00a3900,000 which is released in equal tranches over five years, on top of a \u00a31.2m salary, benefits and bonuses. Carney did not indicate that any work was underway on reviewing the cap and has taken a stance against watering down other financial regulations. He told the Guardian in August \u201cwe\u2019re not going to to go the lowest common denominator\u201d with regulation when the UK had such a dominant financial sector. There have been suggestions that the UK should roll back City regulation in the wake of Brexit to help retain business that could be lost. Major banks are preparing to implement their Brexit contingency plans if a transition deal is not agreed in the coming weeks. Another Bank official has warned up to 10,000 roles could go initially.",

    "webTitle": "Why scrapping bonus cap could be a hard sell for Mark Carney", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s one way to keep those footloose and greedy bankers in London after Brexit: appeal to their wallets by dropping the cap on bonuses, which only applies in the EU. The Bank of England may indeed abolish the cap, Governor Mark Carney hinted on Wednesday, even if the motivation is not vulgar opportunism but an analysis of which financial rules could be rolled back outside the EU. Bank officials always regarded the cap as a technically illiterate piece of legislation, and their worry was justified. The EU\u2019s approach, predictably, was gamed by bank bosses who awarded themselves huge \u201crole-based allowances\u201d by way of \u201ccompensation\u201d for their lower earning potential. In that way, non-contractual payments were turned into guaranteed ones, making it harder for the regulator to order a firm to slash bonuses to preserve capital during times of crisis. Do not surprised, however, if that nuance is lost if the UK is seen, in effect, to tell bankers that fatter bonuses are possible after Brexit. EU leaders will scream that London is leading a race to the bottom. The politics will look terrible on the home front too. We\u2019re paying \u00a350bn to leave the EU and bankers can get bigger bonuses? That\u2019s a tricky sell \u2013 and another line that wasn\u2019t on the leavers\u2019 bus. LSE row shows why companies need to be more transparent In the best farces, everyone ends up losing. So it is at the London Stock Exchange Group, where the three principal characters will stagger from the stage as diminished figures. Xavier Rolet, the LSE chief executive, will spend more time with his vineyard sooner than he expected. He had been set to leave at the end of next year but is now out of the door immediately. He grumbles about \u201ca great deal of unwelcome publicity, which has been unhelpful for the company\u201d, but he is an old City hand who should have known how the script would run. Regulators were bound to back the board in a power struggle at an important City institution. When Carney spoke on Tuesday about an \u201cagreed\u201d succession plan and how \u201ceverything comes to an end\u201d, the game was up. Rolet has enjoyed a glorious nine years at the LSE, in which time the share price has risen from \u00a36 to \u00a337, and a multimillion-pound payoff will ease his bruises, but it\u2019s a messy way to go. Donald Brydon, the chairman, made the basic error at the outset of refusing to explain to shareholders why the board wished to change its chief executive. The omission was glaring and high-handed. In the 21st century, you\u2019ve got justify your decisions \u2013 not necessarily in full technicolour, but at least in outline. If Rolet\u2019s management style was deemed a problem, there are ways of saying so without inviting uproar. Brydon had boasted about running an \u201corderly\u201d succession plan and has instead delivered a version that is as chaotic as they come. His innings will be cut short in April 2019 as a result. Brydon has chaired many public companies, including Royal Mail at the time of privatisation, but being battle-hardened was no use this time. The job was to prevent a battle breaking out. As for Sir Christopher Hohn, the head of the the Children\u2019s Investment Fund, his rebellion has spectacularly backfired. Hohn wanted to extend Rolet\u2019s reign at the exchange until 2021, but instead, he\u2019s shortened it by a year. It was fair for the hedge fund manager to protest about the LSE\u2019s failure to explain, but Hohn\u2019s tactics became bizarre in the later stages. The call for regulators to intervene to resolve the crisis was optimistic in the sense of being half-baked. Carney semi-intervened by speaking out, but he said the opposite of what Hohn wanted to hear. Still, we\u2019ve been treated to an entertaining City bust-up that has usefully reminded the audience that even at successful companies, power struggles can lie around the corner. It has been \u201cmystifying\u201d, as Carney put it, but could also have been prevented. In future, boards may conclude that a little transparency on day one can prevent a lot of trouble later. That would be a good thing. Nuanced reason for scrapping bonus cap will be a hard sell Here\u2019s one way to keep those footloose and greedy bankers in London after Brexit: appeal to their wallets by dropping the cap on bonuses, which only applies in the EU. The Bank of England may indeed abolish the cap, Mark Carney hinted on Wednesday, even if the motivation is not vulgar opportunism but an analysis of which financial rules could be rolled back outside the EU.

    "webTitle": "Pound rallies as progress on Brexit divorce bill raises trade talk hopes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound has climbed to its highest level in almost two months against the dollar amid hopes that progress on Britain\u2019s divorce settlement with the European Union will smooth the way for the start of trade talks. With fears receding that the UK would leave the EU in March 2019 without a trade deal, currency investors pushed sterling higher against both the dollar and the euro on Wednesday. An overnight rally on Wall Street was followed by further gains in European trading. The pound was up 0.67% on the day against the dollar at $1.34, and 1.5% up on its low point on Tuesday, before news emerged of a potential breakthrough in the long-running discussions about money between London and Brussels. Some City analysts warned, however, that the pound\u2019s rise would be capped by concerns that the talks could still be derailed in the weeks and months ahead by differences over the amount Britain intends to pay and by the concessions on trade that the EU would be prepared to make. Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at ayondo markets, said: \u201cThe negotiations are yet to be officially agreed, and I suspect many hard Brexit advocates from the Conservative party will baulk at the idea of paying the \u20ac60bn, with the possibility of further remunerations at a later stage, rumoured to be \u00a380bn-\u00a390bn.\u201d The rise in the value of the pound, if sustained, would lead to cheaper imports and lower inflation, but would make UK exports less competitive. Despite sterling\u2019s jump over the past two days, it remained well below the highpoint for 2017 of $1.3659, which it hit in late September, and more than 11% below the $1.50 level at which is was trading before the JEU referendum in June last year. Stephen Gallo, European head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Financial Group in London, said further progress on trade and a transition deal could push sterling to $1.40 over the next six to 12 months.

      "bodyText": "A mixed day for Europe, but with little real movement on most of the major markets. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved higher after positive remarks on the economy from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, but technology stocks have come under pressure. Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders, told Reuters: What we\u2019re seeing is a combination of defence positioning, with people taking some profit out of the high-growth areas, technology specifically, and rotating into sectors that should hold up better if we get any negative news on the tax bill or debt ceiling. Meanwhile bitcoin is currently up nearly 9% at $10,741 although off the day\u2019s highs of 11,395. In Europe the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 67.09 points or 0.9% at 7393.56 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.02% to 13,061.87 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.14% higher at 5398.05 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.15% to 22,325.94 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.22% better at 10,267.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.67% to 738.31 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 67 points or 0.28%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. But there are some less positive developments in Greece, too. Helena Smith writes: In Greece\u2019s civil court, police have fired rounds of tear gas and been engaged in hand to hand battle with protestors opposing first electronic auctions demanded by creditors in bid to finally deal with Greece\u2019s mountain of bad bank loans. Over in Greece, some positive developments. The country has announced that it has successfully completely a voluntary bond swap worth \u20ac30bn, writes Helena Smith: Likening the bond swap to the country achieving a second foray into the bond market - barely four months after it dipped its toe back into the financial market in July - the government spokesman Dimitris Tzannakopoulos said the bond swap take-up had reached 86.1 %. \u201cIt is a huge development ... and of huge significance for the country,\u201d he told reporters this afternoon. \u201cIn reality it amounts to the second successful market foray afterJuly which is aimed at reprofiling [the country\u2019s] debt so that it will be made more easily negotiable on international markets.\u201d Greece, meanwhile, has resumed bailout negotiations with auditors representing bailout creditors holding a first full day of talks in Athens. At stake is the third - and last - compliance review before Athens exits its third bailout programme in August next year. More on the drop in technology stocks. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Hopes of tax reform continue to drive US markets higher, although the gains are concentrated in those firms which are expected to be significant beneficiaries. Tech is not in that exalted bracket, and as a result is taking heavy losses. The caution is being amplified by comments from the German defence minister, who is arguing for tighter regulation for big tech firms. However, with Wall Street clocking up record highs, markets look vulnerable to some short-term reversals. Short-term reversals are exactly what we got last night on the North Korea news, and the rebound was equally rapid. No doubt there will be plenty of investors willing to buy this micro-dip in the FANG [tech] stocks, especially if they need to spruce up their performance ahead of year-end. One exception in the US markets is the Nasdaq Composite, the technology heavy index which is now down almost 1%. Part of the reason for the rise in US markets is a testimony from outgoing US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to Congress. She made positive noises about the US economy, saying \u201cthe economic expansion is increasingly broad based across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.\u201d This makes a December rate rise even more likely, which has helped banking shares, and more increases could follow. Yellen said, \u201cWe continue to expect that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate.\u201d Wall Street is continuing its surge higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: After a relatively sluggish few weeks the Dow has burst into life in the last couple of sessions. Yesterday it added a whopping 250 points, while today it\u2019s up another 80 points \u2013 who knows, by this evening it could even reach 24000. The thrust of this growth stems from Trump\u2019s progress in pushing through his \u2013 increasingly unpopular \u2013 tax reforms, with the Republicans clearing the Senate Budget Committee obstacle on Tuesday. Wednesday\u2019s cherry on top was the news that the US Q3 GDP reading had been revised higher, from 3.0% to 3.3% at the annualised rate. What goes up... Bitcoin is now at $10,479, down from its peak today of $11,395 but still up from the $9,868 it opened at. Back in the UK, the national minimum wage received by the lowest-paid workers is in the spotlight. The Low Pay Commission, which recommends the minimum wage rates, said in its annual report published this morning that the new rates for 18-20 and 21-24 year olds follow the biggest rise for both age groups in a decade. We already know the rates, which were published last week as part of the budget, but analysis in the report that shows increases from 1 April 2018 of 4.7% and 5.4% respectively \u201cwill benefit between 260,000 and 360,000 young workers directly\u201d after the largest up-rating since 2007. A lower percentage rise has been applied to the National Living Wage (NLW), which covers those aged 25 years old and beyond, of 4.4 per cent. Forecasts for average earnings growth next year fall between 2.5% and 3% the commission said. The weakest rise is being handed to 16 and 17 year olds, who must survive on \u00a34.20, up 3.7% on this year. The commission said: \u201cThe new rates will boost the earnings of between 260,000 and 360,000 young workers directly, and many more young workers will benefit. \u201cThis is for two reasons: firstly, these increases lead to \u2018spillover\u2019 effects further up the pay distribution; secondly, even though they are not entitled to it, some young workers benefit from increases in the NLW. We estimate that up to 45% of 18-24 year old workers \u2013 or 1.3 million young people \u2013 could receive a higher pay increase than they would have done in the absence of the NLW.\u201d Boom! The US stock markets has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both climbed to new levels, following the upgrade in US growth in the last quarter. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, sums up the mood: \u201cToday\u2019s second estimate of US GDP shows the world\u2019s largest economy is clearly firing on all cylinders.\u201d If Donald Trump takes his fingers off the retweet button, he\u2019ll notice that the US economy appears to be doing pretty well on his watch. Here\u2019s Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics on the new growth figures: Third-quarter GDP growth was revised up modestly to 3.3% annualised, from 3.0%, thanks to a stronger positive contribution from business investment and a much smaller drag from State and local government expenditure. The growth rate of final sales to domestic purchasers was revised up as well to 2.5%, from 2.3%. Business investment growth is now estimated to have been 4.7% annualised, with equipment investment up by 10.4%. With borrowing costs still relatively low, confidence strong and capex intentions surveys at elevated levels, we expect another decent gain in the fourth quarter. Bitcoin just smashed through $11,000, defying the doubters with their taunts about tulip bulbs.... Despite its summer surge, the US hasn\u2019t grown quite as fast as the eurozone over the last year. It\u2019s comfortably outpacing Britain, though.... Economists are cheering the news that America\u2019s economy expanded by 3.3% (annualised) in the last three months. This upward revision suggests the US is in decent shape. Here\u2019s some early reaction: BREAKING: America\u2019s economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter of 2017. Fresh figures from the Commerce Department shows that US GDP expanded at an annualised rate of 3.3% in July-September, up from a first estimate of 3.0%. That\u2019s equal to a quarterly growth rate of over 0.8% -- twice as fast as Britain\u2019s 0.4% in Q3. The new data shows that corporate profits boosted growth, jumping by 4.3% quarter-on-quarter. Net trade also boosted growth, with exports up by 2.2% but imports down by 1.1%. Reaction to follow.... German bank Berenberg has raised their forecasts for UK growth over the next couple of years, on optimism that a hard Brexit can be avoided. They say: We raise our calls for real GDP growth for 2018 and 2019 to 1.8% and 1.9% from 1.6% and 1.7% respectively, following modest increases to our growth projections for household consumption and business investment. Our forecasts exceed Bloomberg consensus (29 November 2017) of 1.4% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2019. We see risks to the growth outlook as roughly balanced. Foreign exchange news site DailyFX flags up that the pound has outperformed other currencies against the dollar today: The price of bitcoin is going up even faster than Britain\u2019s potential Brexit bill. The cryptocurrency smashed through the $10,000 mark overnight, and is currently changing hands at $10,900. That means it\u2019s risen by around 1,000% during 2017. Five years ago, you could have bought a bitcoin for only $12.... The higher bitcoin goes, the louder are the warnings that it\u2019s an unsustainable speculative bubble. But then, I can remember the same warnings back in 2013! Sir Jon Cunliffe, the BoE deputy governor, has suggested that potential bitcoin investors should be cautious. He told BBC Radio 5 this morning that: \u201cThis is not a currency in the accepted sense. There\u2019s no central bank that stands behind it. For me it\u2019s much more like a commodity. \u201cThis is not at a size where it\u2019s a macroeconomic risk to the global economy, but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework.\u201d Back to Brexit, and the BBC\u2019s Katya Adler reports that some EU officials are irritated that the \u00a350bn settlement hit the headlines last night. Although they do want money from the UK, they don\u2019t want to be bounced into an agreement. They also don\u2019t accept that any payment will guarantee Britain the post-Brexit deal it wants... She writes: If and when an agreement on the Brexit bill is made, the EU will push back hard at UK government assertions that Brexit financial payments be tied to a future trade and transition deal. Brussels insists this is money the UK owes - dating back to commitments made on annual and long-term budgets while an EU member. \u201cThis is not blood money,\u201d an EU civil servant told me. \u201cThis is money the UK must pay on leaving the EU. The new relationship post-Brexit Britain will have with the EU is something quite separate. Europe is not about to be blackmailed.\u201d Breaking away from Brexit briefly, shipping company Clarksons has admitted it\u2019s been hacked. Clarksons told the City that it has been working with the police since discovering a cybersecurity incident which involved \u201cunauthorised access to the Company\u2019s computer systems\u201d. It warned shareholders that those responsible \u201cmay release some data\u201d today. Andi Case, CEO of Clarksons, has hinted that the company refused to pay the hackers to return stolen data, saying: I hope our clients understand that we would not be held to ransom by criminals, and I would like to sincerely apologise for any concern this incident may have understandably raised.\u201d More evidence that the eurozone economy is ending 2017 on a high, from the EC\u2019s latest health check: Despite Brexit uncertainty, individuals and businesses in Europe are increasingly optimistic. New data from the European Commission shows that eurozone consumer and economic confidence jumped again in November, to their highest level in 17 years. Newsflash: UK households reined in their borrowing last month. Unsecured consumer credit (such as borrowing on credit cards) grew by 9.6% in October compared to a year ago, down from 9.8% in September. That\u2019s the smallest rise since April 2016, and follows concerns that people were being driven into debt by rising inflation and falling real wages. New Bank of England figures also show a fall in the number of mortgages approved by lenders, down to 64,575 in October from over 66,000 in September. Transport secretary Chris Grayling has defended the government against criticism that it might stump up \u00a350bn to leave the EU. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the UK has financial obligations to settle, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think people in this country would expect us to just walk away from things we\u2019ve already said we\u2019d pay for.\u201d Bonus marks to anyone who spotted that on the side of a bus last year. Anyway, Andrew Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the action from Westminster today: The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has sounded a cautious note about the \u00a350bn figure. Collared by reporters in Berlin this morning, Barnier suggested that a deal wasn\u2019t agreed yet. He said: \u201cWe are still working. ....I am working for an agreement.\u201d The pound has rallied against \u201call of its 16 major\u201d rival currencies this morning, reports Bloomberg. Even if a \u00a350bn bill is agreed, Britain faces several hurdles to jump before it can avoid a disorderly Brexit. As well as the Irish question, Brussels also wants commitments on EU citizen rights beyond 2019. Plus, we don\u2019t know that parliament will approve a hefty divorce bill. Neil Wilson of City firm ETX Capital says: First, can Theresa May sell this to voters and to her party. She seems to have some shaky consensus backing for a higher offer but this is contingent on getting a good trade deal \u2013 the EU will not have its hands tied in this way. Therefore we must be wary that the political consensus to pay a bigger bill could unravel; and paying a big bill does not by definition lead to a good trade deal. Capitulating to the EU in this regard carries its own risks for Theresa May, but the risk of a no-deal exit was ultimately too high. Second, the Irish border is still a major stumbling block and it is uncertain whether sufficient progress has been made on this front. This is an even more sensitive topic than the divorce bill and is not as easy to solve with a bigger cheque. The third key barrier for the EU is citizens\u2019 rights and again it is unclear if there is sufficient progress in this regard. Sterling has jumped by 1.4% against a basket of currencies, its biggest rise since April, according to Reuters data. Christmas has come early for Brussels, says Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank wryly. He expects an official agreement on the Brexit bill next month, following the news that the UK has caved in to demands for a \u00a350bn payment. We expect UK PM Theresa May to present a formal offer on the Brexit bill, EU citizens rights, and the Irish border question at the upcoming 4 December dinner between May and EU Commission president Juncker. We expect the offer to meet the EU\u2019s requirement for \u2018sufficient progress\u2019 on the Brexit divorce. If such progress is made, expect the UK and the EU to move negotiations on to potential transitional arrangements and post-Brexit trade at the 14-15 December EU Summit. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Britain\u2019s exit bill is only one part of the Brexit puzzle, of course. We still don\u2019t have any idea how the Irish border question will be resolved; Dublin could block negotiations on trade unless its fears over a hard border are assuaged. As Naeem Aslam of Think Markets puts it: Picking up the Brexit bill has been the very thorny issue since day one and given that now the government has agreed to a respectable amount, the talks between the UK and the EU (which are set to resume next month) should be smoother. If the EU accepts the bill, then we will be moving to the next hurdle which is securing the EU rights [of citizens living in the UK. It is important to keep in mind that we are no way close to be out of the woods when it comes to the smooth negotiation process because the Northern Ireland issue is still the thorny matter. The pound is continuing to climb against the US dollar as investors bet that the Brexit fog is clearing. As Stephen Gallo at the Bank of Montreal put it (via the FT): It\u2019s a buy! The risk of snap election is down, the risk of a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 is down, the path to a transition deal is clearing. The surge in the pound has hit shares in the City. The FTSE 100 is down 31 points at 7429; a stronger sterling reduces the value of money earned overseas by UK-based multinationals. The prospect that Britain and the EU might shake hands on a Brexit bill next month is exciting the City this morning. \u00a350bn is obviously a lot of money, even if split over many years. But traders think it could be worth it, if it opens the door to trade talks. Konstantinos Anthis of brokerage firm ADS Securities explains: Even though the agreement is not yet formal traders are clearly excited by the prospect of progress on this issue. Traders are looking for any positive news in this area as it opens the way for trade negotiations, and are prepared to buy sterling in response. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Sterling is on a roll this morning, amid signs that Britain and the European Union are on the brink of a Brexit breakthrough. The pound has jumped to $1.3406, up almost three quarters of a cent, to its highest level since the end of September. It is also pushing higher against the euro, up 0.3% at \u20ac1.13. The rally was triggered by reports that London could pay a \u00a350bn exit bill, in an attempt to nudge European politicians into starting negotiations about trade. A deal would ease fears that Britain could crash out of the EU in March 2019 in a disorderly Brexit. EU leaders will decide next month whether this is enough to move negotiations onto trade, so this could be a very significant moment. As my colleagues Daniel Boffey and Jennifer Rankin reported last night: Non-stop behind-the-scenes negotiations have led to a broad agreement by the UK to a gross financial settlement of \u00a389bn on leaving the bloc, although the British expect the final net bill to be half as much. A senior EU official told the Guardian that the UK appeared ready to honour its share of the EU\u2019s unpaid bills, loans, pension and other liabilities accrued over 44 years of membership. \u201cWe have heard the UK wants to come along with the money,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe have understood it covers the liabilities and what we consider the real commitments. But we have to see the fine print.\u201d The bill could total \u00a353bn to \u00a358bn (\u20ac60bn to \u20ac65bn), although EU officials are not discussing numbers and the British government will fight hard to bring the total down. Here\u2019s the full story: We\u2019ll be tracking City reaction to the news, along with new data showing the state of the UK, US and eurozone economies. The agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK consumer credit and mortgage approval figures for October 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer and economic confidence stats for November 1pm GMT: German inflation data for November 1.30pm GMT: The second estimate of US GDP for the third quarter of 2017",

In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved higher after positive remarks on the economy from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, but technology stocks have come under pressure. Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders, told Reuters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we\u2019re seeing is a combination of defence positioning, with people taking some profit out of the high-growth areas, technology specifically, and rotating into sectors that should hold up better if we get any negative news on the tax bill or debt ceiling.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile bitcoin is currently up nearly 9% at $10,741 although off the day\u2019s highs of 11,395.</p> <p>In Europe the final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 67.09 points or 0.9% at 7393.56</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.02% to 13,061.87</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 0.14% higher at 5398.05</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.15% to 22,325.94</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.22% better at 10,267.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market added 1.67% to 738.31</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 67 points or 0.28%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

The country has announced that it has successfully completely a voluntary bond swap worth \u20ac30bn, writes Helena Smith:</p> <blockquote> <p>Likening the bond swap to the country achieving a second foray into the bond market - barely four months after it dipped its toe back into the financial market in July - the government spokesman Dimitris Tzannakopoulos said the bond swap take-up had reached 86.1 %.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a huge development ... and of huge significance for the country,\u201d he told reporters this afternoon. \u201cIn reality it amounts to the second successful market foray afterJuly which is aimed at reprofiling [the country\u2019s] debt so that it will be made more easily negotiable on international markets.\u201d</p> <p>Greece, meanwhile, has resumed bailout negotiations with auditors representing bailout creditors holding a first full day of talks in Athens. At stake is the third - and last - compliance review before Athens exits its third bailout programme in August next year. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a1edcd557470105e95751cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-29T16:15:14.482Z\">4.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on the drop in technology stocks. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hopes of tax reform continue to drive US markets higher, although the gains are concentrated in those firms which are expected to be significant beneficiaries. Tech is not in that exalted bracket, and as a result is taking heavy losses.</p> <p>The caution is being amplified by comments from the German defence minister, who is arguing for tighter regulation for big tech firms. However, with Wall Street clocking up record highs, markets look vulnerable to some short-term reversals. Short-term reversals are exactly what we got last night on the North Korea news, and the rebound was equally rapid. No doubt there will be plenty of investors willing to buy this micro-dip in the FANG [tech] stocks, especially if they need to spruce up their performance ahead of year-end.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a1ed95657470105e957519c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-29T16:06:51.081Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One exception in the US markets is the Nasdaq Composite, the technology heavy index which is now down almost 1%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a1ed9e79ab3f2056cb1d8d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-29T16:06:41.502Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Part of the reason for the rise in US markets is a testimony from outgoing US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to Congress.

Yesterday it added a whopping 250 points, while today it\u2019s up another 80 points \u2013 who knows, by this evening it could even reach 24000. The thrust of this growth stems from Trump\u2019s progress in pushing through his \u2013 increasingly unpopular \u2013 tax reforms, with the Republicans clearing the Senate Budget Committee obstacle on Tuesday. Wednesday\u2019s cherry on top was the news that the US Q3 GDP reading had been revised higher, from 3.0% to 3.3% at the annualised rate.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a1ed12d57470105e9575117\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-29T15:30:18.152Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>What goes up...

      "bodyText": "The latest OECD report on Australia takes a rather sunny view despite forecasting GDP and consumption growth in 2018 and 2019 that is lower than was projected in the May budget. But its argument for increased interest rates appears rather out of date and is certainly not reflected by current market expectations of rates remaining low while wages growth remains weak. If you want a bit of an economic pick-me-up, the OECD Economic Outlook is worth a read. The report opens with the positively glowing statement that \u201cthe global economy is now growing at its fastest pace since 2010, with the upturn becoming increasingly synchronised across countries\u201d. The authors note that this lift in global growth has been \u201clong awaited,\u201d has been \u201csupported by policy stimulus\u201d and is \u201caccompanied by solid employment gains, a moderate upturn in investment and a pick-up in trade growth\u201d. All around good news. And Australia does not miss out on this optimism. The OECD opens its section on Australia by predicting that \u201cthe economy will continue growing at a robust pace\u201d and that \u201cbusiness investment outside the housing and mining sectors will pick up, with exports boosted as new resource-sector capacity comes on stream\u201d. The report suggests that \u201cthe strengthening labour market and household incomes will sustain private consumption, and inflation and wages will pick up gradually\u201d. And yet the OECD outlook (which comes via consultation with the Treasury) offers a slightly more pessimistic outlook for the economy than we had in the May budget. There is a bit of fudging because the budget uses financial-year projections and the OECD\u2019s are for calendar years, but the \u201crobust growth\u201d the OECD projects for GDP is just 2.8% in 2018 and 2.7% in 2019, while the budget projected 3.0% growth in 2018-19. Similarly, private consumption growth in the OECD report is projected to be 2.4% in both 2018 and 2019 \u2013 below the 3.0% growth projected in the May budget. But the OECD does forecast stronger export growth and lower unemployment. Where the May budget projected an unemployment rate of 5.5% in 2018-19, the OECD has it falling to 5.4% next year and 5.3% in 2019. But the OECD\u2019s recommendation for the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates is one that does not fit with much of its own commentary about wages growth and inflation. It suggests that the RBA is \u201cprojected to start raising the policy rate in the second half of 2018, and expectations of this move, together with macro-prudential measures, are helping cool the housing market\u201d. And it notes that \u201camid gradual policy tightening and a slow pick-up in wages and prices, consumption growth will remain subdued\u201d. The suggestion that the RBA is projected to start raising interest rates is rather out of date. In September the market was pricing in almost two interest rate rises by the start of 2019, but by the end of October this had fallen to an expectation of one rate raise by the end of next year and a slight chance of another rate rise in the middle of 2019. And now there is only about a 50% chance of a rate rise by December next year: There is unlikely to be a change in these expectations on the basis of any projections in the OECD report. The report, for example, notes that \u201cunder-employment has edged higher and wage growth and inflation remain steady\u201d. It also suggests that \u201csome highly indebted households could face financial stress when interest rates rise\u201d and \u201cthat household indebtedness and signs of a cooling housing market are keeping consumer sentiment relatively soft. Household consumption growth remains subdued\u201d. And yet it then bizarrely suggests \u201con the other hand, a stronger pick-up in wages and incomes could result in higher consumption and growth\u201d. Well, yes, but nowhere does the report suggest that is about to happen. Indeed, the link of under-employment and wage growth is well noted, given the very strong relationship between the two measures over the past decade and half: Currently the under-employment rate is at a record high of 8.7%. For private sector wages growth to return to the 3% the May budget predicts for 2018-19, history suggests it would need to fall to around 7.6% \u2013 140,000 fewer people under-employed. The OECD also notes that the housing market is cooling due to expectations of rising interest rates and the macro-prudential regulations that have limited investor lending, and that \u201crising household indebtedness\u201d is \u201ckeeping consumer sentiment relatively soft\u201d. Certainly our household indebtedness is rising \u2013 to the record level of 194% of household disposable income. That\u2019s 26% points higher than it was five years ago: Given this level of debt, it is odd to think that raising interest rates would result in higher consumption growth. As ever, the OECD also advocates for tax reform \u2013 including lowering the company tax rate. But crucially, it is within the context of shifting our dependence on tax from income to consumption taxes and it recommends broadening the base of the GST. Such a move would unlikely do much to promote consumption growth and at any rate is politically dead, given the main way to broaden the GST is to put tax on fresh food \u2013 a very regressive move that would require significant outlays to compensate poorer households: The OECD report for Australia has a positive outlook almost in spite of itself. The growth projections are a mixture, but overall no better or worse than was estimated in the May budget but the OECD sees good times ahead. And yet its major recommendation that the Reserve Bank should increase interest rates despite evidence of ongoing weak inflation and wages growth is one that would likely undermine that rosy outlook \u2013 especially if it were to occur while our under-employment levels remain at record highs.",

      "bodyText": "The NHS\u2019s public health boss is urging local councils and shopping centres to ban visits from Coca-Cola\u2019s promotional Christmas trucks because of sugar\u2019s key role in rotting children\u2019s teeth and making them fat. Duncan Selbie, the chief executive of Public Health England, has criticised the soft drink giant\u2019s annual PR stunt, in which 14-tonne lorries decorated with fairy lights and fake snow visit towns, cities and landmarks around the UK to advertise its products. Selbie\u2019s comments come as PHE research found that most of the places the trucks plan to visit before Christmas have above-average rates of children with tooth decay or obesity. \u201cBig-name brands touring the country at Christmas to advertise their most sugary products to children and boost sales does nothing to help families make healthy choices and wider efforts to combat childhood obesity and rotten teeth,\u201d Selbie said. \u201cLocal authorities celebrating sugary drinks in this way need to reflect on whether it\u2019s in the best interests of the health of local children and families.\u201d Coca-Cola is sending two articulated lorries to 42 locations in England and Scotland in the run-up to Christmas, including Wembley in north London, the O2 complex in the capital\u2019s Docklands and the Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock, Essex. The firm\u2019s promotional material says the trucks will be \u201cdelivering Christmas cheer up and down the country. At every stop you\u2019ll have the chance to project your festive selfies across the side of the truck as it lights up. \u201cYou\u2019ll also be able to experience a snowy winter wonderland setting while enjoying a choice of Coca-Cola Classic, Diet Coke or Coca Cola Zero Sugar.\u201d Staff will offer consumers, many of them children, free 150ml samples of the three drinks at a truck lit by 372 bulbs and 8,772 fairy lights. But PHE believes that Coke\u2019s marketing risks worsening already high rates of tooth decay and obesity. On Thursday, one of the trucks is due to visit Bolton, where 40.5% of five-year-olds have tooth decay \u2013 the highest number of all the areas on the list. Overall, 61% of the stops are in places where both five- and 12-year-olds have higher rates of rotten teeth than the English average, NHS dental statistics reveal. The same proportion of places have an unusually high number of 10- and 11-year-olds who are overweight or obese, while 56% have above-average numbers of children aged three and four in reception class who are dangerously overweight. Councils and health officials in areas already visitedby the trucks have protested against the marketing stunt, and some have called for an outright ban on the trucks. The tour began on 11 November in Glasgow, where Linda de Caestecker, the director of public health at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, was among 44 people urging Coke to give away only water and sugar-free versions of its products. In a letter, they called on the company to be more responsible in how it markets its products and highlighted the large numbers of young children in the city who were overweight, obese or have tooth decay. \u201cThe bright lights of the Coca-Cola truck and giving out free fizzy drinks will of course appeal to children. But when we\u2019re in the midst of an obesity epidemic \u2013 and have increasing numbers of children with tooth decay \u2013 it\u2019s not really doing children any favours,\u201d said Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing increasing numbers of local protests against the truck, both from the public and council leaders, public health professionals and dentists. The motivation behind these is not to take the joy out of Christmas; but to recognise that linking fizzy drinks with the fun of the festive season is a marketing tactic and not good for child health,\u201d she added. Coca-Cola defended its use of the promotional Christmas trucks, which it says have made 397 stops and covered 730,000 miles in the UK. \u201cThe Coca-Cola Christmas truck tour is a one-off, annual event where we offer people a choice of 150ml samples of Coca-Cola Classic, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar or Diet Coke, so two of the three options are no sugar drinks. This is also reflected in the take-up of samples on the truck tour, with on average over 70% of what we sample being a zero-sugar option,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said. \u201cWe also have a policy of not providing drinks to children under the age of 12, unless their parent or guardian is present and says they can have one. The truck tour route changes every year as we try to cover a fair geographical spread of the UK.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s consumer debt boom has eased back after growth in lending on credit cards and loans fell to an 18-month low. The Bank of England said unsecured consumer credit grew by 9.6% year on year in October, down from 9.8% in September, soothing fears that banks were lending recklessly at a time when household incomes have come under pressure from stagnant pay growth and high inflation. Britons added \u00a31.5bn to the pile of consumer debt, which rose to more than \u00a3205bn. The Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe said he did not think British households as a whole were going on a \u201cdebt-fuelled binge\u201d, but fast rates of consumer credit growth needed to be watched. With salary increases averaging 2.2% and prices increasing at an average of 3%, central bank officials have warned high street banks to rein in their risky lending to head off a consumer debt bubble. Anti-poverty charities, concerned that middle and low-income families are turning to credit to supplement their incomes, have blamed welfare cutbacks for exacerbating the problem. Peter Tutton, the head of policy at debt charity StepChange, said: \u201cDespite a slight slowdown, consumer credit continues to grow strongly. \u201cThis comes against the backdrop of forecasts of the longest sustained period of falling living standards since the 1950s, so the fact that 9 million people are currently using credit in order to cover essential costs should put tackling problem debt high on the policy agenda.\u201d Howard Archer, an economic adviser to the forecasting group EY Item Club, said: \u201cThe Bank of England will be pleased with the slowdown in consumer credit in October and will be looking for a continuation of this trend. \u201cIn its November financial stability report the Bank of England again warned that rapid growth in consumer credit has created a \u2018pocket of risk\u2019 and the central bank has also warned that banks risk becoming complacent in their lending behaviour.\u201d The Bank\u2019s credit condition survey indicated that lenders cut the amount of unsecured credit available in the three months to the end of September at the fastest rate since 2009. Analysts said the Bank\u2019s message to lenders heightened uncertainty over the outlook for the UK economy, and increased concerns about personal finances were encouraging some consumers to be more cautious in their borrowing. \u201cHowever, the persistent squeeze on consumer purchasing power is likely fuelling the need for some consumers to borrow,\u201d Archer said. In October, the Bank hinted strongly that it planned to raise interest rates, which went up from 0.25% to 0.5% on 2 November. Analysts said the threat of higher interest rates was likely to have dampened consumer credit, which was increasing at a rate of more than 10% earlier this year. Bank figures also show a fall in the number of mortgages approved by lenders in October, from more than 66,000 in September to 64,575. The fall in mortgage approvals for house purchases was the third monthly drop in a row and pushed the total to a 13-month low. The gloom was only alleviated by a frenzy of remortgaging approvals, which increased to 51,593, the highest number since October 2008. Lenders were kept busy by homeowners wanting to lock in low rates before the interest rate rise. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, said figures showing a slowdown in corporate borrowing indicated that companies were unwilling to invest while the economic outlook remained uncertain. \u201cThe most interesting dynamic within the numbers may be that loans and overdraft facilities to the nation\u2019s SMEs [small and medium-sized companies] fell by \u00a3400m between September and October,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThis highlights that these companies, which represent the backbone of the UK economy and are the largest employers of the UK workforce, are either unable or unwilling to borrow to fund current or future investment projects.\u201d Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "London Stock Exchange Group has asked its chief executive, Xavier Rolet, to leave immediately \u2013 a year earlier than planned \u2013 in an effort to an end to a row with one of its shareholders over the departure. The company said Rolet was stepping down \u201cat the board\u2019s request\u201d, six weeks after it announced he would leave by the end of next year and help with the appointment of his successor. It comes a day after Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, said he was \u201cmystified\u201d by the continuing row over the departure. The original announcement on 19 October about Rolet stepping down triggered a backlash from the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Management (TCI), which has a 5% stake in LSE and fought against his departure. TCI called for an emergency general meeting to reinstate Rolet \u2013 assuming he wanted to remain in the role \u2013 and to replace Donald Brydon as chairman. The LSE group said on Wednesday that Brydon would not stand for re-election at the annual general meeting in April 2019, and has asked TCI to withdraw its request for a general meeting. In a statement announcing his immediate departure, Rolet said: \u201cSince the announcement of my future departure on 19 October, \u200ethere has been a great deal of unwelcome publicity, which has not been helpful to the company. \u201cAt the request of the board, I have agreed to step down as chief executive with immediate effect. I will not be returning to the office of chief executive or director under any circumstances. I am proud of what we have achieved during the past eight-and-a-half years.\u201d A day earlier, Carney was asked for his views as he presented the results of the latest bank stress tests, and said he was a bit mystified about the debate. \u201cI can\u2019t envisage a circumstance where a chief executive stays beyond the agreed period. But it\u2019s in the interest of all parties involved that clarity is provided as soon as possible.\u201d Carney said Rolet had \u201cmade an extraordinary contribution \u2026 [but] everything comes to an end\u201d. David Warren, the LSE group\u2019s finance director, will take on the additional role of interim chief executive until a successor to Rolet is found. The LSE group said in a statement: \u201cIf TCI does not withdraw its requisition in full, the board intends to publish a shareholder circular confirming among other things the date of the general meeting at which the proposed resolution or resolutions will be put. The circular would be published no later than 30 November 2017.\u201d TCI declined to comment. Brydon said: \u201cThe board is confident London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) will continue to prosper with David Warren as interim chief executive and the existing strong management team. They have deep knowledge of [the] business and helped shape, lead and execute its strategies. \u201cThey are already working towards LSEG\u2019s current three-year financial targets. I look forward to working with David and his team. We acknowledge, as I said last month, Xavier\u2019s immense \u2013 indeed transformative \u2013 contribution to the business.\u201d Rolet has been chief executive of the LSE group since May 2009, and the company said his 12-month notice period would start immediately and be spent on garden leave, during which time he would \u201cbe available to be consulted at the board\u2019s discretion\u201d. He is entitled to leave with a maximum renumeration package of about \u00a313m. That includes his salary of \u00a3800,000 for the 12-month notice period and a bonus of up to \u00a31.8m for 2017. The rest is made up of long-term incentive plan payouts and deferred bonuses which would be paid out over a period of time to April 2020. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has indicated that the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange should step down, after saying he was \u201cmystified\u201d by the continuing row about the departure. Carney waded into the clash, which has been going on for weeks since a major LSE shareholder tried to block Xavier Rolet\u2019s exit. The Children\u2019s Investment Fund (TCI), which owns 5% of the LSE and has been leading the fight against his departure, called on the Bank and the Financial Conduct Authority to intervene. TCI wants the regulator to replace the chairman, Donald Brydon. Carney was asked for his views as he presented the results of the latest bank stress tests, and said he was \u201ca bit mystified about the debate\u201d. The Bank regards the LSE as an important part of the global financial infrastructure because it has majority ownership of the clearing house that stands behinds billions of pounds of financial contracts. Carney said the Bank had been kept informed about management changes. \u201cI can\u2019t envisage a circumstance where a CEO stays beyond the agreed period. But it\u2019s in the interest of all parties involved that clarity is provided as soon as possible,\u201d he said. Carney praised Rolet, who has been chief executive of the LSE since May 2009. His departure was announced in October. At the time, the LSE said a search for Rolet\u2019s successor was under way and he would leave at the end of next year. Carney said Rolet had \u201cmade an extraordinary contribution \u2026 [but] everything comes to an end\u201d. The LSE has a deadline of the end of Thursday to publish a circular in response to a demand by TCI for an emergency shareholder meeting to remove Brydon and end to the search for a new chief executive. The circular may provide more details about the circumstances surrounding Rolet\u2019s departure. Sir Christopher Hohn, the TCI founder, has said Brydon \u201cfailed to provide shareholders with any substantive basis for the removal of the chief executive\u201d. \u201cHiding behind confidentiality agreements denies shareholders the ability to review your actions and demonstrates the bad corporate governance over which you are presiding,\u201d Hohn said. The emergency meeting is expected to take place before Christmas. Rolet, who has repeatedly warned that Brexit could cost the UK 232,000 financial services jobs, had been planning to retire if a deal to merge the LSE with its German rival Deutsche B\u00f6rse had been completed. The deal was blocked by the European commission in March, on the day the UK formally began its departure from the EU. Neither the LSE or TCI would comment on Carney\u2019s remarks.",

There was a little fiddling at the edges; the cut in stamp duty designed to help first-time buyers amounted to nothing as it will cause house prices to rise and wipe out any benefit. In the end, it will help only existing homeowners. Same old, same old, in terms of austerity, with more cuts still to come for years ahead. Not unrelated to that was the downgrade in the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast of productivity growth and consequently economic growth. GDP per head was downgraded by a cumulative 1.9% between now and 2021. The GDP growth forecast for 2017 is now a derisory 1.5%; 1.4% in 2018; 1.3% in both 2019 and 2020; 1.5% in 2021 and 1.6% in 2022. No other chancellor has ever had to report such a dreadful growth forecast for so long. As a result the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that by 2021 average earnings are set to be \u00a31,400 lower than the government had predicted they were going to be. The Resolution Foundation said British people are now set to suffer their longest sustained period of falling living standards since records began in the 1950s. But it could be a lot worse than that. First, the OBR has assumed that the Brexit negotiations go smoothly, and there is every indication that this is unduly optimistic. Discussions about the Irish border question are not going well and are adding to the uncertainty that firms are facing because of the uncertainty over the apparently stalled negotiations. Second, the OBR is still assuming there will be a major pick-up in productivity very soon compared with the average that has prevailed since the great recession. It provides no evidence to support the possibility of any pick-up at all, especially as investment is being held back owing to the enhanced levels of uncertainty. There is no reason, in my view, to believe any takeoff in productivity will happen soon, given the OBR has assumed a surge in every one of its forecasts since June 2010. If either of these two problems arise, the economy could grow much more slowly than even the OBR\u2019s horrid forecasts. I am still waiting for any good news from Brexit.

The industry lobby group, the ATM Industry Association, has warned the changes put forward by the Link network could lead to parts of the UK becoming \u2018ATM deserts\u2019 with at least 10,000 free-to-use cash machines at risk. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative head of the influential parliamentary committee, has asked the chair of the network to outline how many machines will shut and how to ensure vulnerable customers are not left at a disadvantage by the closures.

Morgan said that \u201cit seems intuitive that some machines will become economically unviable\u201d. In a letter to Link chair Sir Mark Boleat she asked what processes Link had in place to determine whether the closure of an ATM would cause consumer detriment.
