      "bodyText": "Rangers has moved to end its turbulent commercial relationship with Sports Direct after the football club saw off a legal challenge from the retail chain. In a message to supporters, the Rangers chairman, Dave King, said he had written to Sports Direct formally giving notice to end the joint venture. The statement came a day after the retailer dropped a high court attempt to prevent the disclosure of details behind the tie-up. \u201cFor the first time, a board of this club has stood up to the threats of Sports Direct and has achieved resounding success in court proceedings, including the substantial recovery of legal costs,\u201d King said. \u201cWe will continue to put Rangers first and ensure that we get redress and compensation for the poor commercial and business practices that the club has been forced to endure.\u201d However, the contract holds Rangers to a seven-year notice period, which means the club\u2019s links with Sports Direct might not be severed completely until 2023. Under the terms of the joint venture, the Glasgow club earned 4p from every \u00a31 spent in its merchandise stores. King said he had formally given notice to end the relationship \u201cwhile still reserving our right to proceed with challenges to the existing suite of contracts and side agreements in a court of law\u201d. Earlier this week, Sports Direct, which is controlled by the Newcastle United owner, Mike Ashley, abandoned efforts to prevent disclosure of the venture. An interim gagging order was imposed last summer, blocking Rangers from publicly revealing details of its agreement with the retailer, which contains swingeing clauses that have been heavily criticised by fans. By continuing with efforts to extend the order, Ashley, who owns 55% of Sports Direct and about 9% of Rangers, faced being called to the high court to give evidence. In agreeing to the nationwide chain\u2019s request to abandon its case, the high court judge Mr Justice Peter Smith said he was keen to curtail a \u201cridiculous piece of litigation\u201d. King promised a \u201cturning point in the future of the club\u201d when he led a consortium to win control of the Rangers board in March. They voted the former Rangers chief executive Derek Llambias and the former finance director Barry Leach, both of whom were linked to Sports Direct, off the board in May. King described the payment of \u00a35m to recoup a loan from Sports Direct in November to keep the club solvent as an \u201cunanticipated investment\u201d. Sports Direct\u2019s battle with Rangers is the latest in a string of corporate bust-ups for Ashley. He accused the board of online retailer Findel of \u201cunder-delivering for shareholders\u201d after it rejected a proposal to put his representative on the board. Ashley was also involved in a spat with Adidas over the sale of premium football kits and attempted to sack the board of Blacks Leisure in a row about the potential sale of the Freespirit board sports chain. The company and its founder have also faced a barrage of criticism since December, in the wake of a Guardian investigation that found that the retailer was effectively paying thousands of temporary warehouse workers below the minimum wage. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Sports Direct pledged \u00a310m for a pay rise for staff from the start of this year and said it wanted to become the best high street employer after John Lewis. Sports Direct was unavailable for comment and Rangers declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Contrary to the concerns about government delivering numerous budget deficits, it is the growth and acceleration of private debt we, alongside policymakers, should be worried about - not public debt, which amounts to little more than a neo-con scare campaign. This is because private debt drives asset price inflation (bubbles). These bubbles always burst, causing economic destruction and financial disruption. Just ask the Americans, Irish or Japanese. Yet, all we hear from the Coalition and ALP is the need to transition the budget back to surplus as this represents \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d, while treating private debt as a no-go zone. Why? Because Australia\u2019s household sector is the most indebted in the world and nobody wants the value of their homes and investment properties to sink. In the real world, public debt tends to spike in reaction to economic downturns generated by financial instability and deflating asset bubbles (and historically during the two world wars). In other words, public debt is the buffer and lifeline that enables a government to absorb a wealth of economic pain in times of need. The private sector debt accounts are composed of three subsectors: household, non-financial business and non-banking financial, such as when a property developer takes out a loan from a bank. They are in gross, unconsolidated terms, meaning intra-sector debts are not netted out as one entity does not guarantee the debts of another. In contrast, public debt is consolidated because the federal government guarantees the debts it holds of others. As of the third quarter of 2015, Australian public debt was by internaional standards a low 38% of GDP while private debt reached a staggering ratio of 279%. Households were 123%, non-financial business (83%) and non-banking financial (73%). There is some evidence to suggest public and household debt undermines economic growth once it reaches a threshold of 85%, and 90% for the non-financial business sector. More recent analysis suggests there is no particular threshold for public debt. Unfortunately, Australia\u2019s household sector surpassed that long ago, with non-financial business debt closing in. There is no publicly available data on the long-term trends in public debt, requiring it to be constructed from a variety of sources. I suspect the reason it has not been made openly available by government is because it would demonstrate the hysteria about the \u201cbudget emergency\u201d, \u201crecord deficit\u201d and so on is blatantly false. Public debt peaked in 1932 at 173% of GDP, when the economy was far less productive. Today, it is low compared to historical trends. Probably the most accurate measure of the public debt burden is to compare net interest payments to GDP and revenue. In 2015, net interest payments were 0.7% to GDP and 2.9% to revenue; well within the margins of safety. Lower interest rates have translated into lower net interest payments. Both public sector surpluses and current account deficits (CADs) draw demand out of the private sector; the only way it can grow is through deficits, via increased indebtedness and reduced savings (the sectorial accounting approach). This explains why private debt exploded under the Howard government with ten out of twelve budgets producing a surplus, combined with persistent CADs. This was terrible economic management. Given the long-term data shows public debt to be at record lows, why is there so much debate about reducing the public debt? After all, former treasurer Joe Hockey admitted there was no budget emergency. Instead, the government has fabricated panic over public debt because: It distracts from the threat of the massive private sector debt boom, financialisation and the housing bubble; Privatisation is put forward as a solution to reduce public debt; To prevent government from funding infrastructure efficiently, given borrowing costs and fees are significantly lower than that of the private sector; It provides a pretext for austerity; and It ensures government has room to ramp up public debt to fund a future bailout of Australia\u2019s highly leveraged banking system. Australia should follow the example of Germany, one of the few developed nations to avoid a housing bubble by keeping its private debt issuance under control. It has much lower debt to GDP ratios in each of its three private subsectors of around 54% to 70%, with public debt at a higher 80% with a current account surplus. A more sensible approach is for government to engage in moderate and persistent deficits of around 3% of GDP, as has occurred in most years since federation, which allows the private sector to accumulate net assets rather than maximise leverage. In this regard, it is critical the public and policymakers refocus on and rein in exponentially-growing private sector debts as this comprises a major source of future financial instability. Ironically, by ignoring private debt expansion which has generated a housing bubble, public debt will inevitably rise to stimulate the economy to counteract the economic downturn when it bursts. This is what we should be paying attention to.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Did you miss Thursday\u2019s super soaraway stock market? OK, it was a local affair that wasn\u2019t obvious in the headline figures \u2013 the FTSE 100 index advanced a trifling 60 points, or 1%. But look what happened to some very large companies. Anglo American up 20%, Glencore 16% higher, BHP Billiton 11% dearer, even the Shell colossus advanced 6%. These are huge moves. What happened? The short answer is that the market suspects the US Federal Reserve is having second thoughts about increases in interest rates. Nor is the idea wildly speculative. William Dudley, a top Fed official, said on Wednesday that monetary conditions had tightened since December\u2019s quarter-point rise and rate setters would have to take note. Further strengthening in the dollar, added Dudley, could have \u201csignificant consequences\u201d for the health of the US economy. Translation: the Fed probably won\u2019t raise in March. Cue a selloff in the dollar after its spectacular rise in the past six months. And, since a weaker US currency is generally good for commodity prices, cue a rise in the share prices of miners and oil producers. At current depressed levels, these companies\u2019 earnings are ultra-sensitive to even small improvements in the prices of copper, iron ore, oil and so on. One good day for natural resource stocks doesn\u2019t make a trend, however. There are two reasons for caution. First, we have seen similar rallies in commodity prices fizzle out many times in the past couple of years. At $35 a barrel, oil is only where it was at the beginning of the week and, at that price, nobody is making much money. ConocoPhillips underlined the depth of the downturn by cutting its dividend for the first time in a quarter of a century. Second, a U-turn by the Fed on interest rates would hardly be unqualified good news. Yes, public displays of central bank dovishness \u2013 as seen at the Bank of England, following Japan and the European Central Bank \u2013 can raise investors\u2019 spirits for a while. But if the US economy is so fragile and unproductive that it can\u2019t bear another rate rise, that\u2019s outright bearish for everybody. Three offer doesn\u2019t add up to much How super. Three has pledged to freeze mobile phone prices for five years if it is allowed to buy O2 in the UK. Canning Fok, the co-managing director of parent company CK Hutchison and chairman of Three UK, made this supposedly generous offer in a letter to the FT. He is clearly rattled by the mounting opposition \u2013 led by UK regulator Ofcom \u2013 to his \u00a310.5bn deal. But the price promise isn\u2019t remotely generous, a fact that is obvious as soon as you realise that Fok expressed it in terms of voice minutes, texts and megabytes. The price of such telephonic items invariably falls, year after year, as the technology advances. Look, for example, at Vodafone\u2019s third quarter figures on Thursday. In Europe, the company\u2019s revenues were broadly flat but its European customers\u2019 data usage increased by roughly two-thirds. In other words, the price per megabyte plunged, which should surprise nobody. The long-term trends in this industry are established and, on a like-for-like basis, all-you-can-eat data packages should continue to become cheaper for consumers if competition is working well. Independent analysts at New Street Research called Fok\u2019s promise \u201cempty\u201d. They\u2019re right. Fok might as well have promised that the wind will continue to blow post-merger. Three\u2019s limp idea of a price \u201cguarantee\u201d underlines how much UK consumers could lose if the European commission gives a thumbs up to this plainly anti-competitive takeover. Ofcom boss Sharon White should keep up the good fight. Going gets tough for AstraZeneca bonuses Earnings guidance and remuneration are separate issues, says Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca. Well, yes, but what happens if your annual bonus depends, in part, on meeting a target for earnings that becomes harder to achieve because you\u2019ve just spent $10bn (\u00a36.9bn) on businesses that have no earnings? AstraZeneca\u2019s biotech bets for the future may or may not prove to be good business. We\u2019ll have to wait half a decade to find out. In the meantime, should the company\u2019s pay committee, when judging annual bonuses, adjust for the short-term dilution to earnings? It is allowed to do so, but awards might smell like policymaking on the hoof unless the arithmetic is 100% clear. In AstraZeneca\u2019s case, it would surely be better to scrap annual bonuses altogether. After all, the only target that really matters is Soriot\u2019s ambition to improve annual revenues from $25bn to $45bn by 2023.",

      "body": "<p>Did you miss Thursday\u2019s super soaraway stock market? OK, it was a local affair that wasn\u2019t obvious in the headline figures \u2013 the FTSE 100 index advanced a trifling 60 points, or 1%. But look what happened to some very large companies. Anglo American up 20%, Glencore 16% higher, BHP Billiton 11% dearer, even the Shell colossus advanced 6%. These are huge moves. What happened?</p> <p>The short answer is that the market suspects the US Federal Reserve is having second thoughts about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/27/federal-reserve-interest-rates-unchanged-global-markets-recession\">increases in interest rates</a>. Nor is the idea wildly speculative. William Dudley, a top Fed official, said on Wednesday that monetary conditions had tightened since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rate-rise-fed-funds-janet-yellen\">December\u2019s quarter-point rise</a> and rate setters would have to take note. Further strengthening in the dollar, added Dudley, could have \u201csignificant consequences\u201d for the health of the US economy. Translation: the Fed probably won\u2019t raise in March.</p> <p>Cue a selloff in the dollar after its spectacular rise in the past six months. And, since a weaker US currency is generally good for commodity prices, cue a rise in the share prices of miners and oil producers. At current depressed levels, these companies\u2019 earnings are ultra-sensitive to even small improvements in the prices of copper, iron ore, oil and so on.</p> <p>One good day for natural resource stocks doesn\u2019t make a trend, however. There are two reasons for caution. First, we have seen similar rallies in commodity prices fizzle out many times in the past couple of years. At $35 a barrel, oil is only where it was at the beginning of the week and, at that price, nobody is making much money. ConocoPhillips underlined the depth of the downturn by cutting its dividend for the first time in a quarter of a century.</p> <p>Second, a U-turn by the Fed on interest rates would hardly be unqualified good news. Yes, public displays of central bank dovishness \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/bank-of-england-votes-9-0-to-keep-interest-rates-on-hold\">as seen at the Bank of England</a>, following Japan and the European Central Bank \u2013 can raise investors\u2019 spirits for a while. But if the US economy is so fragile and unproductive that it can\u2019t bear another rate rise, that\u2019s outright bearish for everybody.</p> <h2>Three offer doesn\u2019t add up to much </h2> <p>How super.

Barclays had argued that the documents contained legal advice protected by client-lawyer privilege.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One last thing...The London stock market outperformed its French and German rivals today, to finish 61 points higher, or 1%, at 5898. Mining shares led the way, with Anglo American surging by 19%, Glencore gaining 15% and Antofagasta jumping by 14%. That followed the sudden weakening in the US dollar, as Wall Street and the City anticipated that US interest rates would not rise much this year, given recent weak data. A cheaper dollar pushes up commodity prices, while looser monetary policy should be good for growth. Welcome news for miners, who had a torrid 2015. Mining stocks have also been heavily shorted by hedge funds, so those bears will have been squeezed by the rising share prices. Good night. GW A late PS... Larry Elliott, our economics editor, has summed up the message from the Bank of England today. Here\u2019s his conclusion: There are three conclusions to be drawn from the inflation report, the minutes and the governor\u2019s letter. The first is that it would now be a major surprise if interest rates rose this year. The second is that the Bank\u2019s credibility has been dented by its failure to call the economy right and the confused messages it has been sending out to the public. Finally, the prospect of 0.5% interest rates extending into an eighth and perhaps a ninth year risks stoking up a housing boom. The Bank has so-called macroprudential tools that can be deployed to cool down the property market without damaging the rest of the economy. It is going to need them. And finally, a couple of photos from today\u2019s press conference just landed: Ouch. The latest economic data from America is a reminder of why the Bank of England is worried about the global economy. US factory orders shrank by 2.9% in December, according to new data - the biggest drop since the end of 2014. Being criticised by journalists is an occupational hazard in central banking, but Mark Carney doesn\u2019t appear to enjoy it. So he may not particularly like this analysis of today\u2019s inflation report, from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway. Mr Carney\u2019s problem is that every time he makes a big forecast he seems to get it wrong. When he came into office, the Governor brought with him a whizzy new framework for setting UK interest rates. Under \u201cforward guidance\u201d, he would provide clarity about borrowing costs. He promised, based on the Bank\u2019s forecasts, that he and the Monetary Policy Committee would start to consider lifting them only when unemployment dropped beneath 7%. Suddenly, within a few months, the jobless rate, hitherto stuck stubbornly above that level, started to come down. Within a year, forward guidance had to be dropped, replaced with a far more vague set of promises some nicknamed \u201cfuzzy guidance\u201d. Not to be deterred, Mr Carney started to drop hints about when the first rise in rates would come. In a speech at the Mansion House in 2014 he signalled that rates would go up sooner than markets expected (which meant within a year). That was wrong. Last summer he predicted the decision to raise rates would come into sharper relief \u201cat the turn of the year\u201d. That was wrong. Well, unless you\u2019re being very literal indeed and think it could also entail not raising rates. The one prediction he has stuck to that had, up until now, looked pretty uncontroversial was that the next move in rates would be up rather than down. But, in the past few weeks even that has now come into question.... More here: The Independent\u2019s Ben Chu flags up one curious moment in today\u2019s press conference: That\u2019s a bit odd, as you might expect inflation to take off sharpish once spare capacity in the labour market has been sucked up. As, indeed, a former Bank deputy governor pointed out: Today was dubbed \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d, but it was more like \u201cParty pooper Thursday\u201d as the Bank of England cut its growth forecasts. Savers, who might wonder when they might get a higher interest rate, won\u2019t be feeling particularly super, either. Rohan Sivajoti, advisory services director at financial advisor eVestor, says: \u201cWith a unanimous vote to keep interest rates unchanged, a mediocre global economic outlook and growing deflation fears, \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 has proved to be anything but. \u201cBeleaguered savers, who yet again will be inwardly groaning at the news, may also be resigned to the fact that they have limited options at present. However, now more than ever, savers need to make their investments work harder for them. Those looking to secure their financial future, should review deposits and options for investments and look at reducing debt while it is still relatively cheap to do so.\u201d There was quite a contrast between Mark Carney\u2019s performance at the press conference, and the minutes of this week\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee meeting released at noon. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg Bank, says the MPC are clearly worried. The MPC cautioned on risk from financial market volatility, slowing global growth and now the EU referendum. The committee noted that since the previous report other central banks including the European Central Bank had eased further, oil prices had fallen and financial market volatility had risen. This was linked to developments in China and other emerging markets and had \u2018coloured\u2019 the outlook for the global economy Stephanie Flanders, JP Morgan\u2019s chief market strategist for Europe (and former BBC economics editor), says weak wage growth could scupper a rate hike this year. She writes: The bottom line of today\u2019s report is that the UK cannot ignore the weakening of global growth prospects \u2013 particularly the weakness of global trade \u2013 and neither can the Bank of England. But domestic consumption is driving the recovery in the UK and the US and the Bank of England can see little reason to expect domestic consumption to grind to a halt. On balance, we still expect the US Federal Reserve to raise rates again over the course of 2016 as recession worries recede and sentiment in emerging market economics starts to stabilise. In that environment, we would expect the Bank of England also to raise rates by the end of 2016. However, much will depend on domestic wage pressures, which look somewhat weaker now than they did 6 months ago. Whatever happens, the high level of UK household debt \u2013 much of it borrowed on adjustable or semi-adjustable mortgages \u2013 underscores that the rate increases that do happen will be gradual and modest relative to past cycles.\u201c Back in 2014, Mark Carney was labelled the \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d for giving mixed messages about possible rate rise timings. Today, it felt like the governor was playing a defensive husband, denying that he ever misled the public while insisting that he\u2019ll still raise rates at the right time. Anyway, a quick recap: The prospects of an early UK interest rate rise have receded, after the Bank of England left borrowing costs at a record low of just 0.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee voted 9-0 to leave rates at 0.5%, with noted hawk Ian McCafferty abandoning his calls for a rise. The BoE has slashed its growth forecasts. It now expects GDP to rise by just 2.2% this year, not 2.5%, as Britain is hit by the weakening global economy. Mark Carney has insisted that interest rates are still more likely to rise, than fall. The governor faced down a sceptical press pack in London, who reminded the governor that his previous forward guidance on the path of interest rises has proved somewhat unreliable. Asked if he sticks to his previous prediction that the next move will be upwards, he declared \u201cAbsolutely. The whole MPC stands by that.\u201d Carney also rejected criticism for telling households recently that interest rates were \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to rise in 2016. He said his original forward guidance, that rates would stay on hold until the economy improved, had given businesses and households confidence. We are not going to tie our hands ever to raise interest rates or adjust policy in any way, shape or form to a certain date.\u201d Governor Carney warned that problems in the global economy could hurt Britain, saying: The outlook for trade is particularly challenging, with net exports expected to drag on UK growth over the forecast period. But he tried to play down the idea that Britain could follow Japan and the Eurozone into imposing negative interest rates. Carney said a rate cut hasn\u2019t even been discussed at this week\u2019s MPC meeting, but the committee does keep its tools under review. And asked about the EU referendum, Carney said the Brexit risk has had some impact on the pound. \u201cThere is not yet a big risk premium built into business and household confidence around the referendum. We do see in th eexchange rate market, and it\u2019s observed in the report, that there has been some buying of protection if you will, around the referendum.\u201d That\u2019s the end of the press conference. The press pack are scrambling back to their newsrooms, and Mark Carney has headed back to his office to keep the monetary wheels in motion. I\u2019ll pull together a summary shortly. Q: Negative interest rates are now in place in Japan, the eurozone, and Switzerland, so are they within the Bank\u2019s toolkit? Carney replies that the bank thinks interest rates are \u201cnot at the lower bound\u201d - in other words, they could be cut further. We will review our toolkit, he continues. But we have not discussed negative rates, as monetary policy is pointing in a different direction. He reminds the reporters that they saw the minutes of this month\u2019s MPC meeting, while they were locked in a room \u201cbeing treated pretty badly and forced to read a bunch of documents\u201d*. Those minutes show that negative interest rates weren\u2019t discussed. You\u2019ll know when they are... [* - don\u2019t worry, they probably get drinks and biscuits too] Another questions about Brexit -- what contingency plans have the BoE taken? Carney declines to reveal any details, but suggests that - like with the 2014 Scottish referendum - the Bank will reveal its homework after the event. Q: Are you worried, governor, that you might go through your entire tenure at the Bank without raising interest rates? Carney insist he\u2019s relaxed about this prospect. He points out that former policymaker David Miles did two terms without raising interest rates, but did plenty of other things such as quantitative easing. The important thing is that we set policy to maximise the changes that we meet our objectives. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to be judged. Q: How worried is the Bank of England about the global economy? We do see some downside risks, Carney replies. Britain is a particularly open economy, so it\u2019s very vulnerable to global problems. That\u2019s why the Bank of England usually has lower growth forecast than other bodies, such as the IMF. He cites market fears over China, and its knock-on impact on other emerging markets. And monetary policy could tighten more quickly, if those upside risks develop. Q: When does low inflation start to become a worry for the Bank? Carney bats this question over to Ben Broadbent. Broadbent says there\u2019s \u201cno simple level when it becomes an over-riding concern\u201d, but the bank is watching wages closely for signs that inflation is weakening. Now deputy governor Ben Broadbent takes the microphone, insisting that there\u2019s no \u2018mechanical link\u2019 between the UK output gap and any interest rate move. You might remember that the output gap was one measure cited by Mark Carney in 2014, when he took his second stab at setting forward guidance on interest rates. So, it\u2019s still a factor, but don\u2019t expect it to trigger an interest rate hike. We won\u2019t be \u201cbound by past comments\u201d when we decide it\u2019s time to raise interest rates, says Carney. He also denies that his forward guidance, various speeches, and wotnot have caused volatility. Short-term UK interest rates are half as volatile as before he was parachuted into the BoE City experts aren\u2019t very impressed with Mark Carney\u2019s performance, as he tries to talk down the Brexit risk and talk up the chances of an interest rate hike: Our economics editor Larry Elliott asks Carney when the decision about rate rises will come into \u201csharper focus\u201d again. Carney denies that the MPC are looking at monetary policy through bleary eyes. We take a decision at every meeting. This week\u2019s decision was \u201ceasy\u201d, though. Carney gets a question about the European Union referendum. He says the Bank of England isn\u2019t modelling for \u2018parallel universes\u201d, so today\u2019s report doesn\u2019t estimate the impact of Brexit. He argues that there isn\u2019t yet a \u201cbig risk premium\u201d due to the possibility of Britain leaving the EU. However, there has been some impact on the pound as investors seek protection ahead of the referendum. Mark Carney is trying to argue that the financial markets are underpricing the chances of a UK interest rate rise. Paul Diggle, economist at Aberdeen Asset Management, isn\u2019t sure Carney\u2019s message will get through: The Bank did send a signal that they think the market is wrong about when it thinks rates will rise. Investors think the first rate rise won\u2019t come until February 2018 and the Bank has tried to say they should bet on it coming sooner. But the way they send this signal is so opaque \u2013 a couple of graphs buried in chapter 5 of the Inflation Report - it\u2019s not really clear whether anyone will pay attention. Carney\u2019s forward guidance certainly hasn\u2019t paid dividends for investors up until now.\u201d Carney is now warning that there could be more slack in the labour market than first thought. That would mean wage growth might be disappointing (as firms wouldn\u2019t have to fight for workers as much), meaning inflation remains weak. But he also points to the introduction of the national living wage, which should raise inflation a bit. (from April, workers in the UK aged over 25 earning the minimum rate of \u00a36.70 per hour will get a 50p per hour increase). Q: Do you think the public gives your advice as much credibility as it used to, given previous guidance on rates? Carney gives a long answer, defending his original forward guidance (he originally set a 7% jobless rate as a key target before considering a rate rise, only to backtrack when it was achieved sooner than planned). The worst thing we can say about that guidance is that more people went to work earlier - and we\u2019re not going to apologise for that, Carney smiles. And he\u2019s also happy that UK households believe rates may rise this year, as it means they are less likely to risk a credit splurge. Although households have made \u201cgreat progress\u201d, they are still pretty indebted. Carney insists, though, that the MPC will never \u201ctie its hands\u201d to changing monetary policy at a certain time, or at certain events. And in short, we have nothing to explain, he concludes -- a classic central banker\u2019s answer to criticism. Onto questions: Q: Does Mark Carney still believe interest rate are more likely to rise, rather than fall? Absolutely, the governor replies, and so does the monetary policy committee. He reiterates that the market path of rates implies that inflation will overshoot the 2% target in the medium term unless borrowing costs are hiked. Interest rates are more likely than not to rise during the forecast horizon, says Carney. He points to the current \u201cmarket path\u201d for interest rates (where investors expect borrowing costs to be). On that path, inflation will hit its 2% target in the medium term, and then rise higher, meaning higher borrowing costs will be needed. And Carney insists: We\u2019ll do the right thing at the right time, on rates. Katie is tweeting the key points from Carney\u2019s press conference: Carney says the Bank of England expects real incomes in the UK to grow solidly this year, after several lean years. And business investment should also continue to grow strongly. Carney then warns that global financial conditions have deteriorated notably recently, with a \u201cparticularly challenging\u201d outlook for trade. That means Britain\u2019s net exports will continue to drag on growth (ie, we\u2019ll import more than we sell to the rest of the world) The governor of the Bank of England is giving a press conference now, to discuss the quarterly inflation report. Mark Carney begins by saying that the UK economy is in much better shape than in March 2009 when rates were first cut to 0.5%. Seven years ago, the economy was in serious trouble at the height of the financial crisis, and heading into recession. Today, we have sluggish global growth, turbulent financial markets, and a resilient UK economy. And that\u2019s why the Bank still expects the UK economy to keep growing. The prospect of UK interest rates being cut to a new record low is looming over the City: It\u2019s staggering to think that UK interest rates have now been pegged at 0.5% for almost seven years (it started in the dark days of March 2009) Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says we could see a decade of ultra-low rates: \u2018An interest rate rise is like the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the nearer you get to it, the further away it moves. A rise in rates now looks firmly in the long grass, with growth forecasts cut and cheaper oil putting downward pressure on inflation, which is already way below the Bank of England\u2019s target. Markets are currently pricing in a rate rise in the middle of 2017, though they have been consistently premature in their forecasts, and reaching the dubious milestone of a decade of ultra-low interest rates is now a distinct possibility. The prospect of an early UK interest rate rise has receded into the distance, writes Katie Allen from the Bank of England. She reports: The Bank flagged the recent sharp sell-off in global stock markets and investors\u2019 jitters about a slowdown in China as it revealed that policymaker Ian McCafferty dropped his recent call for a rate rise. He had voted against the eight other members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) since last August but this month agreed with his colleagues that it was too soon to raise interest rates from 0.5%, where they have been for almost seven years. Wage growth has been weaker than the MPC had been expecting and minutes to its latest policy meeting suggested it was cautious about predicting any significant pick-up in pay over coming months. \u201cAgainst that backdrop, all members of the committee thought that maintaining the current stance of policy was appropriate at this meeting,\u201d the minutes said. Here\u2019s Katie\u2019s full story: The pound has fallen almost half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.456. Markets are concluding that interest rates won\u2019t move for some time, given today\u2019s gloomy inflation report and the news that Ian McCafferty has given up calling for a rate hike. The Inflation report is online here, and full of interesting charts if you like that kind of thing. This one shows how the oil price has fallen much further than the Bank expected: And this shows how the markets are already expecting interest rates to stay lower, for longer. This chart shows how the Bank of England has cut its growth forecasts for the next three years (the old forecasts are in brackets after the new ones) And the message from the BoE is that economic conditions have deteriorated over the last quarter: Since the November Report, global output and trade growth have slowed further and the latest data suggest a softer picture for UK activity in 2015 than previously assumed, with four-quarter growth slowing to 2\u00bc% by Q4 on the MPC\u2019s backcast. The Bank of England also points to the turmoil in the financial markets: Developments in financial markets seem in part to reflect greater weight being placed on the risks to the global outlook stemming from China and other emerging economies. The Bank of England has also taken a knife to its growth forecasts, admitting that the UK economy is not expanding as fast as expected. It now expects GDP to rise by just 2.2% this year, down from 2.5% three months ago. And for 2017, it has cut its growth forecast to 2.3%, down from 2.6%. The Bank of England says that economic conditions have deteriorated in the last three since its November quarterly inflation report: Global growth has fallen back further over the past three months, as emerging economies have generally continued to slow and as the US economy has grown by less than expected. There have also been considerable falls in the prices of risky assets and another significant fall in oil prices. The 9-0 vote means that Ian McCafferty has abandoned his calls for interest rates to rise. He had been the lone hawk on the MPC, arguing that borrowing costs should go up now before inflation took hold. But with oil so cheap, and growth weakening around the globe, he\u2019s had a rethink. Breaking: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates at their current record low of 0.5%. And the decision was unanimous, with the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee voting 9-0 not to alter borrowing costs. We have less than 30 minutes to go until Bank of England announces its interest rate decision, at noon in London. It will also release its latest quarterly inflation report, with new forecasts for growth and inflation. And half an hour after that, Mark Carney will hold a press conference to discuss the report. This is the third \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d -- but frankly, the first two haven\u2019t lived up to this billing, thanks to the lack of pressure to raise interest rates and the mediocre global economic outlook. Alastair McCaig of IG reckons it needs rebanding: How the department overseeing the trade descriptions act have not intervened in the use of the term \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 when the Bank of England posts its inflation report and interest rate decision, is somewhat baffling. Anyway, the smart money is on another \u2018no change\u2019 in interest rates, followed by plenty of questions about the darkening global outlook, deflation fears, and whether Britain could follow Japan and the eurozone into imposing negative interest rates. Ed Conway, writing for Sky News today, points out that borrowing costs could be cut this year. Households should prepare themselves for a possible UK interest rate cut this year, with investors betting that there is now a greater chance that the next move in borrowing costs is down not up. Money markets are now putting a one-in-four probability on the Bank of England reducing its official rates below the 0.5% level they have been sitting at since 2009. It follows a dramatic shift in their expectations for interest rates. For the majority of the post-crisis recovery, markets were betting that 0.5% would be the floor for borrowing costs, which would rise in the coming years. Now they are not pricing in a full increase in Bank rate until August 2018 - two months after Mark Carney\u2019s five year term as Bank Governor is due to end... Back in Brussels, Pierre Moscovici has explained that his latest forecasts don\u2019t factor in the prospect of Britain\u2019s leaving the EU. Why not? Because everyone\u2019s committed to avoiding such an outcome. Moscovici has also defended the EC\u2019s more rosy forecasts for Greece (well, less gloomy, anyway): Shares in London have been lurching around like a well-refreshed journalist leaving The Inkwell after last orders (I imagine). After jumping almost 90 points at the open, the FTSE 100 index slowly subsided until it was only up 20 points, before getting a second wind and romping ahead again. Mining companies are still leading the way, with Anglo American leaping by 11%, BHP Billiton gaining 8% and Antofagasta up 7.5%. It makes for a tricky morning for traders: So why the wild lurches? Investors are trying to decide how much optimism to take from the rally in the oil price, and the sudden weakness in the US dollar. This could mean that the turmoil in the commodity market is reaching a bottom, especially if the US Federal Reserve is backing away from raising American interest rates several times this year. The City is also waiting for the Bank of England to deliver its quarterly inflation report, in an hour\u2019s time. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist, at DailyFX, says markets expect a \u201cdovish outcome\u201d. Traders are currently pricing in a 64% chance that rates remain unchanged over the next year, and a 36% probability that rates are cut to 0.25%, he adds. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is briefing the media now, about the EC\u2019s new economic forecasts. My colleague Jennifer Rankin is tweeting the key points: I can\u2019t believe *anyone* is euphoric, given the last few years. But do carry on, Pierre... The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel is also ferreting out some important facts: Despite those headwinds from China and refugees, the European economy is now entering its fourth year of recovery, says the EC. Today\u2019s report states: Growth continues at a moderate rate, driven mainly by consumption. At the same time, much of the world economy is grappling with major challenges and risks to European growth are therefore increasing. A flurry of news is flying our way from Brussels, as the European Commission releases its new economic forecasts. The headline event is that the EC has slashed its forecast for inflation this year to just 0.5%, from 1% three months ago. That\u2019s partly because of the oil price, and also because \u201cwage growth remains subdued\u201d. It has also trimmed its growth forecast for 2016 to 1.7%, down from an earlier forecast of 1.8%. The EC still expects eurozone GDP to rise by 1.9% in 2017, as the slow recovery picks up pace (a little). The Commission blames problems in emerging markets, and also points to the refugee crisis. Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis warns: Europe\u2019s moderate growth is facing increasing headwinds, from slower growth in emerging markets such as China, to weak global trade and geopolitical tensions in Europe\u2019s neighbourhood.\u201d The EC has also revised up its Greek forecasts, saying the economy didn\u2019t actually contract in 2015. It also expects a smaller recession this year. Greece is in the grips of a general strike today as demonstrators renew their protests against the country\u2019s latest bailout deal. Transport links are shut down, shops are closed, and thousands of people are marching through the Greek capital right now. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports that the effects are withering. She writes: This is the fifth general strike since the leftist Syriza first came to power but none has been so fully endorsed. In a reflection of the growing anger at all embracing tax and pension reforms, the entire country appears to be paralysed by industrial action supported by every walk of life. In Athens, where almost nothing is open, streets and central boulevards resembled a ghost town this morning with the shutters down on shops, offices and ministerial buildings. Small businesses, which usually turn a blind eye to the pleas of unionists to stay closed, have today heeded their call. \u201cWe have no choice,\u201d said Lakis Antonakis who owns the popular Piazza Duomo caf\u00e9 opposite the capital\u2019s cathedral. \u201cIf they pass these laws more than 50 percent of our earnings will be taxed and I am one of the lucky ones because I can depend on tourists. Other businesses are really struggling. It\u2019s become unsustainable to keep them open. Everyone is very pessimistic.\u201d Unionists, who planned mass protest rallies, attributed the high turn out to the determination of Greeks to ram home the message that they will not accept pension and tax reforms as they now stand. International creditors, led by the IMF, are pushing prime minister Alexis Tsipras for further cuts in pensions to make up for a fiscal shortfall of up to \u20ac4.5bn over the next three years. Grigoris Kalomoiris, of the civil servants union, Adedy, said he also thought Greeks had been encouraged by protesting farmers who have set up roadblocks nationwide. \u201cTheir action over the past two weeks has had a ripple effect. Everything is close even the state audit office,\u201d he told me. \u201cFarmers are leading the way. People are very determined to stop this pillaging because pillaging is what it is. Greece and Greeks cannot go on being pushed like this in the name of debt.\u201d The strike, ironically, has the full support of Syriza \u2013 although government officials, who will soon be called to vote on the reforms, are keeping mum. Apparently the solution to monetary policy paralysis is taller central bank governors: You might have expected the euro to fall this morning, after Mario Draghi guilefully declared that central banks shouldn\u2019t stop taking action to fight deflation. But the single currency didn\u2019t take the hint. Instead, the euro has hit a three-month high against the US dollar, at $1.116. And that\u2019s starting to weigh on European markets, pushing shares down from their earlier highs.... Sales of Volkswagen cars slumped by almost 14% in the UK last month, suggesting that the company is still suffering from the emissions scandal. Just 12,055 VW-branded cars were registered in January, down from 13,993 in January 2015, according to new figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. That cuts VW\u2019s market share to 7.1%, from 8.5%. Other Volkswagen brands also had a bad month. Sales of Seat cars slumped by 25%, from 4,137 to 3,119. This is the fourth month in a row that VW car sales have dropped, following last year\u2019s revelations that it used cheat software to get around emissions tests. Overall, the UK\u2019s new car market got off to a positive start in January, according to the SMMT. Registrations rose by 2.9% compared with the same month in 2015 to reach an 11-year high of 169,678 units. Goldman Sachs has weighed into the Brexit debate, predicting that the pound would slump by around 15% if Britain vote to leave the EU. In a new research note, it argues that investors would be put off from putting capital into the UK if the public reject David Cameron\u2019s new deal. And if the domestic economy also suffered, sterling would come under sustained pressure - due to the country\u2019s current account deficit. Goldman predicts: In our framework, a decline of 2% in domestic demand would still see close to a 15% drop in the British pound to close the current account deficit. Worth remembering that Goldman isn\u2019t completely impartial in this fight. The Bank has apparently given a six-figure donation to the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, which is fighting against Brexit. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi has dropped a clear hint that the ECB embark on fresh stimulus measures next month. Speaking in Frankfurt a few minute ago, Draghi insisted that central bankers can\u2019t just stop trying to hit their inflation goals because \u201cglobal disinflation\u201d is dragging prices down. He declared: There are forces in the global economy today that are conspiring to hold inflation down. Those forces might cause inflation to return more slowly to our objective. But there is no reason why they should lead to a permanently lower inflation rate. What matters is that central banks act within their mandates to fulfill their mandates. In the euro area, that might create different challenges than it does in other jurisdictions. But those challenges can be mitigated. They do not justify inaction. The speech is online here. Double ouch: Ouch. Shares in Credit Suisse have tumbled by around 10% in early trading. The Swiss bank is missing out on today\u2019s rally, after hitting shareholders with a loss of 5.83 billion Swiss francs ($5.8 billion) in the last quarter. That drove the bank into its first annual loss since 2008. Credit Suisse took a bigger-than-expected charge to cover restructuring its investment bank,. as new CEO Tidjane Thaim tries to turn the firm around. Thaim was also quite gloomy about the situation today, warning that: Market conditions in January 2016 have remained challenging and we expect markets to remain volatile throughout the remainder of the first quarter of 2016 as macroeconomic issues persist . Oil is continuing to gain ground this morning, adding to last night\u2019s 8% surge. Brent crude has risen to $35.36, up another 1%. European stock markets are a sea of green, as traders welcome the higher oil price and the weaker US dollar. Up we go! European markets are rallying at the start of trading, breaking three days of declines during this volatile week. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares opened 80 points higher, at 5917. That\u2019s a gain of 1.2%, clawing back Wednesday\u2019\u2019s losses. The German, French, Italian and Spanish markets are also up at least 1%. Mining companies are leading the recovery. The weaker US dollar should spur demand for natural resources, as it will take some pressure off emerging markets. And Shell\u2019s shares are rising, despite the company posting an 87% drop in profits this morning. Investors may have feared an even worse performance, given the slump in the oil price. The key to today\u2019s market moves is that the US dollar took an almighty tumble overnight. After strengthening for months, the greenback suffered its biggest one-day drop since 2011. That followed Wednesday\u2019s disappointing US services sector data, which made investors conclude that US interest rates are unlikely to be hiked anytime soon. Perhaps not until 2017? Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the dollar fell on hopes that the Federal Reserve will \u201creign in its over-egged hawkishness\u201d. This delivered a welcome overshadowing of global growth concerns for markets hooked on cheap money. And this chart puts the dollar\u2019s weakness into some contect: It\u2019s been another day of wild market action in Asia. Most stock markets have surged overnight, on relief that the oil price has climbed back to over $35 per barrel. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 index led the way, jumping by 2%, with investors hoping that the commodity crunch may be bottoming out. Only Japan missed out, because the yen gained against the US dollar (bad news for Japanese exporters) From Melbourne, Chris Weston of IG calls it \u201can incredible night of moves in markets\u201d. And the trigger was the oil price, which has gained almost 10% since yesterday afternoon. What we have seen is one of the most amazing one day moves in oil one will ever see, with US and Brent oil rallying 9% and 8% from yesterday\u2019s ASX 200 close. Oil is benefitting from a weaker dollar, rumours that OPEC might pull an emergency meeting to cut production, and suggestions that the selloff has simply gone too far. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Bank of England Super Thursday -- that time of the quarter when the UK central bank sets interest rates, and also releases its latest inflation report. \u201cSuper\u201d could be pushing it, though. We\u2019re expecting rates to remain unchanged at 0.5% (of course). The BoE will probably also lower its forecasts for growth and inflation, reflecting recent turmoil and rising pessimism about the world economy. Governor Mark Carney will then face the cream of the economic press pack, who will presumably try to get him to admit that interest rates are highly unlikely to rise this year (despite Carney\u2019s recent pronouncements). Might they even be cut to fresh record lows, governor?... Also coming up today... It\u2019s going to be another lively day in the markets. European shares are expected to rally strongly, after three days of falls, and oil is looking perkier too (more on that shortly) European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is giving a speech in Frankfurt this morning; could that include fresh hints about ECB stimulus in March? In the corporate world, we\u2019re getting results from oil group Shell and mobile network operator Vodafone, among others. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "A lawyer for the US government seeking to extradite a British trader to stand trial has claimed that he made a profit of nearly $900,000 (\u00a3615,000) by manipulating the stock market to cause the \u201cflash crash\u201d on Wall Street in 2010. At the start of a two-day extradition hearing in London on Thursday, Mark Summers said the US government was seeking to prosecute Navinder Singh Sarao on 22 criminal counts, including wire fraud, commodities fraud and attempted price manipulation. The US government alleges that Sarao\u2019s behaviour helped cause the sharp fall in equity prices on 6 May 2010. If the judge presiding over the hearing approves extradition, the decision must be ratified by the home secretary, Theresa May. Summers, prosecuting, said: \u201cThe [US] government says the defendant placed sell orders for stocks but never intended to sell. Sales were cancelled without ever being executed, but the market believed there was a liquid market for stocks he was advertising for sale.\u201d Sarao had made millions from other, mainly US traders, through driving prices down and then buying at a cheaper level, in a practice known as spoofing, he alleged. \u201cThe defendant on this day was heavily engaged in his spoofing activities, which contributed to the market imbalance.\u201d The US justice department claims that Sarao and his company, Nav Sarao Futures Limited, made $878,000 profit from the flash crash and a total of \u00a326m illegally over five years. The Hounslow-based former bank worker and Brunel University student, who is fighting extradition to the US, faces charges that carry sentences totalling a maximum of 380 years. He denies all the charges. Sarao, who was sitting in a side room to the court behind glass, was smartly dressed in a grey suit and brown leather shoes. He had his head down for much of the hearing. Lawyers for the US government told a hearing in September that Sarao also faces new allegations relating to emails he sent. Summers read some of these out. One email Sarao is alleged to have sent to somebody helping him with his computer software said: \u201cI really do not know how long I can wait. Every day I am getting hit on my spoofs.\u201d After lunch the court heard from a defence expert witness, Lawrence Harris, the professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California, who said there was no single cause of the flash crash but a sequence of events, for which the main trigger was concern about the Greek debt crisis. Harris, giving evidence by video from the US, said there was also a major trader who submitted a large sell order into the market and wanted it filled in 20 minutes. \u201cThe seller\u2019s software instructed it to increase the speed of the trades, which created instability for other traders.\u201d In cross-examination, Summers said that data examined by a prosecution witness, Terrence Hendershott, showed that Sarao\u2019s trades had an abnormally high cancellation rate, which he said was consistent with market manipulation. District judge Quentin Purdy initially set a \u00a35m surety as part of Sarao\u2019s bail conditions, which the trader claimed that he was unable to pay. He was released on conditional bail in August after providing a \u00a350,000 surety. The extradition hearing at Westminster magistrates court continues.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tata Steel has reported a quarterly loss of \u00a368m, more than double the figure in the previous three-month period, at its European business. The loss before interest, tax and other items for the three months to the end of December rose from \u00a325m in the previous quarter. A year earlier, Tata\u2019s European operation made a profit of \u00a3132m. Revenue dropped 3% to \u00a31.64bn in the third quarter compared with the previous three months, and was down 16% from \u00a31.98bn a year earlier, even as demand in Europe increased. Deliveries of steel, at 3.35m tonnes, rose quarter on quarter and in comparison with a year earlier. Tata Steel, part of Indian conglomerate Tata, said a surge in imports put further pressure on price margins during the third quarter. It called for action in the UK and Europe to help the business compete fairly with rising imports from China that are below cost, as well as from countries such as Russia and South Korea. Tata\u2019s results highlight the crisis facing Britain\u2019s steel industry, where 5,000 workers have lost jobs since last summer. The company, which owns the remnants of British Steel, announced a further 1,050 job losses last month, taking total cuts at its UK arm to about 3,000 since October. Karl K\u00f6hler, the chief executive of Tata Steel\u2019s European operations, said: \u201cGrowing European steel demand continues to be undermined by a flood of imports into the region. \u201cThe European Steel Association has identified that Chinese steel is being exported at prices below the cost of production. This unfair trade is undercutting domestic producers and harming the European steel industry, which employs many thousands of people and is at the foundation of much of the region\u2019s cutting edge innovation.\u201d Tata\u2019s third quarter European steel production was little changed from the preceding period, at 3.56m tonnes, and was down 5% on a year earlier. Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of Community, the steelworkers\u2019 union, said: \u201cTata Steel is clearly facing unprecedented pressure from a difficult global market and unfairly traded steel. \u201cSupport that has finally been forthcoming from the UK and the EU has been too slow to impact on these results and as further delays in action and implementation continue, more steelworkers\u2019 jobs are threatened.\u201d",

Lord King, a lifelong Villa fan, joins a club seemingly destined for relegation, given they are six points adrift at the foot of the table and failed to sign any players in the January transfer window. Aston Villa\u2019s chairman, Steve Hollis, likened the task that King faces to battling the fallout from the financial crisis. \u201cMervyn successfully steered the Bank of England through the most turbulent economic headwinds in living memory,\u201d he said. \u201cHis appointment to the board is a huge boost as we plan our path back to more successful times.\u201d King said: \u201cI watched my first match at Villa Park more than 55 years ago, and have experienced the highs and the lows since then. I shall do my best to help the rebuilding of Aston Villa football club as together we return it to its position as one of the top clubs in the world.\u201d During his time at the Bank, King is understood to have discussed monetary policy with Aston Villa\u2019s German midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger in email exchanges. And King, who became chairman of Worcestershire county cricket club in 2014, once organised a charity game at Threadneedle Street between Bank employees and former Villa players from the club\u2019s 1982 European Cup-winning side. Villa\u2019s latest signing became Bank of England governor in 2003 and held the post for a decade. He was appointed a life peer by the Queen in 2013, entering the House of Lords as Baron King of Lothbury. As governor, King, 67, was among the most powerful Villa fans, alongside Prince William and the prime minister, David Cameron. However, during the 2015 general election campaign, Cameron was mocked after mistakenly claiming that he supports West Ham, who play in similar colours to Villa. King\u2019s successor as governor, the Canadian Mark Carney, is a diehard Everton fan. King is the second high-profile economist to join the board of a struggling Premier League club this season, after Norwich City appointed the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls as club chairman.",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England and interest rates: always crashing in the same car", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England goes to considerable lengths to explain its thinking. Once a quarter, it publishes an inflation report (pdf) running to almost 50 pages and the minutes of the latest meeting of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee. When inflation is more than one percentage point away from the target, as it is now, it also releases an exchange of letters between the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, and the chancellor, George Osborne. It is not really necessary to wade through all the analysis, though, because the late, great David Bowie summed things up in six words: always crashing in the same car. Wages and growth forecasts have been cut. Once again, the MPC has pushed back its estimate of when inflation will hit the 2% target. Carney is readying himself to send more missives to Osborne throughout the course of the year. Threadneedle Street thinks that the next move in interest rates will be up, but it is not 100% sure. The Bank\u2019s sole hawk, Ian McCafferty, has given up the fight for the time being. With all nine members of the MPC now unanimous in voting for borrowing costs to remain at 0.5%, the message from the Bank to anybody thinking about taking out a mortgage or a bank loan is that interest rates are going nowhere fast. Carney\u2019s assertion in a speech in Lincoln cathedral last July that the rate decision would come into sharper focus around the turn of the year was quickly overtaken by events and now looks plain wrong. Financial markets currently don\u2019t expect interest rates to rise until the second half of 2018, by which time the governor\u2019s five-year term at the Bank will be up. Threadneedle Street is cautioning against reading too much into what the markets think and it is certainly true that the mood in the City can change rapidly. Some economists still believe that monetary policy will be tightened in the second half of 2016. So what would trigger such a move? Put simply, there would have to be evidence that ultra-low oil prices are having only a temporary downward impact on inflation and have helped disguise upward pressure on wages caused by falling unemployment. The Bank thinks that there is very little spare capacity left in the economy and the slack that remains will be used up during the course of this year. That would suggest an increase in the cost of borrowing long before 2018. The problem, though, is that all the recent signs on wages and earnings have been pointing in the other direction. Since the last inflation report in November, the Bank has cut its estimate for average earnings growth from 2.5% to 1.75% in 2015 and from 3.75% to 3% in 2016. On past form, the chances are that the forecast for this year will be cut again, not least because the low level of inflation has started to drag down pay settlements. There are three conclusions to be drawn from the inflation report, the minutes and the governor\u2019s letter. The first is that it would now be a major surprise if interest rates rose this year. The second is that the Bank\u2019s credibility has been dented by its failure to call the economy right and the confused messages it has been sending out to the public. Finally, the prospect of 0.5% interest rates extending into an eighth and perhaps a ninth year risks stoking up a housing boom. The Bank has so-called macroprudential tools that can be deployed to cool down the property market without damaging the rest of the economy. It is going to need them.",

Chung has helped create a 31-piece collection, to launch in April, inspired by the retailer\u2019s archive. The collaboration came about after Chung helped turn a 1970s-style suede skirt into a fashion sensation for M&amp;S last spring after she was photographed wearing it. The chain claimed demand for the suede skirt had helped sales even before it hit stores. M&amp;S needs to attract younger shoppers after recording just one quarterly increase in clothing sales over the past five years. The company brought in former Debenhams boss Belinda Earl as an advisor and has been through a string of clothing bosses in the past few years but has yet to find the right formula to win back shoppers. Steve Rowe, the current head of general merchandise and whose remit includes clothing, will become chief executive of M&amp;S in April, taking over from Marc Bolland. He has already shaken up the clothing management team and working with Chung is likely to be seen as a statement of his intent for the future of the brand. The company said the tie-up was the first of the \u201cM&amp;S &amp;\u201d series: \u201cA sequence of unique, exclusive collections in collaboration with some of today\u2019s most exciting designers, brands and fashion icons.\u201d Rowe said: \u201cMarks &amp; Spencer\u2019s history is vast and quality design has always been paramount; therefore, using our expertise and classic designs and Alexa\u2019s unique eye and approach to style, our collaboration was born. A new womenswear collection, curated by Alexa, with heritage firmly at its heart.\u201d Chung, a TV presenter and model, will also be directing the advertising campaign to launch her collection. British Vogue, which first revealed the collaboration, said it was a \u201cclever match\u201d for M&amp;S as Chung had a \u201cpersonal penchant for androgynous sweaters, floral dresses, peter-pan-collar blouses and a well-tailored pair of shorts \u2013 all of which the M&amp;S archives must be brimming with.\u201d M&amp;S has previously tried working with celebrities with mixed success.

      "bodyText": "The prospect of a UK interest rate rise has receded further after the Bank of England cut its forecasts for growth, wages and inflation. However, the governor, Mark Carney, warned borrowers against getting too comfortable with rock-bottom rates. Carney quashed recent market speculation that a global economic slowdown could prompt a rate cut. But at the same time, the Bank revealed that its policymakers had voted unanimously to hold borrowing costs this month and they gave little indication that there would be an early increase. The Bank governor used his quarterly inflation report briefing to say that after almost seven years at a record low of 0.5%, interest rates were \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to need to go up over the next two years. He also cautioned against repeating the mistakes of the past, when rate rises had come as a shock to indebted households and businesses, and said he wanted to send a clear message to households. \u201cWe are trying to inform the markets, and most importantly households and businesses in this country, what\u2019s likely to happen on rates,\u201d Carney said. \u201cIt is helpful, in my opinion, for households and businesses to recognise that it\u2019s more likely than not that rates are going to go up and to plan their affairs accordingly, particularly since while there\u2019s been tremendous progress \u2013 British households have done a great job in paying down debt \u2013 they are still relatively indebted.\u201d The comments come after Carney was forced to row back on a suggestion made last summer that a decision on starting to raise interest rates would \u201ccome into sharper relief\u201d around now. On Thursday, he insisted he would not allow the Bank to \u201ctie our hands\u201d with guidance. The tone of the Bank\u2019s latest outlook for the economy suggested that policymakers would be in no hurry to raise rates. Economists do not expect a move until the end of this year, according to a Reuters poll before Thursday\u2019s update from the Bank. Financial markets are not pricing in a rise for another two years. After a tumultuous start to the year on financial markets thanks to jitters over China\u2019s economic slowdown, the Bank predicted that emerging economies were likely to grow more slowly than in recent years and that global growth would be \u201conly modest\u201d. But Carney said the UK was well placed to cope with global headwinds thanks to high employment, strong domestic demand and a better capitalised banking sector. \u201cAs one of the most open economies in the world, the UK cannot help but be affected by an unforgiving global environment and sustained financial market turbulence,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, our prospects for a continued solid expansion are underpinned by the resilience built over the past seven years.\u201d The governor\u2019s remarks came alongside the Bank\u2019s quarterly deluge of documents, including minutes from the latest interest rate decision and the inflation report with forecasts for the economy. The pound initially weakened against the euro and the US dollar as those minutes revealed that policymaker Ian McCafferty dropped his recent backing for a rate rise. He had voted against the eight other members of the monetary policy committee since last August, but this month agreed with his colleagues that it was too soon to raise interest rates. Sterling later bounced back as traders digested Carney\u2019s message that interest rates were more likely to rise than fall. The Bank softened its outlook for inflation, which has been close to zero for a year as global commodity prices have tumbled. At 0.2% in December, it was well below the Bank\u2019s target of 2%, measured on the consumer prices index (CPI). \u201cThe scale of recent commodity price falls means that CPI inflation is likely to remain below 1% until the end of the year,\u201d the inflation report (pdf) said. One of the key factors behind McCafferty\u2019s change of heart and the Bank\u2019s softer inflation forecasts was lacklustre wage growth. That had come in weaker than the MPC had been expecting and policymakers were cautious about predicting any significant pick-up over the coming months. They noted signs that wage negotiations were being affected by low inflation, with employers perhaps less generous and workers being less demanding given that they were enjoying a boost to household budgets from cheaper fuel and food. As headline inflation picked up, nominal wage growth would \u201cin all likelihood\u201d increase. However, the MPC said there were downside risks to such a view. On the outlook for economic growth, the Bank repeatedly used the word \u201cresilient\u201d with regard to household and business spending. But the MPC cut its forecasts and now expects GDP growth of 2.2% this year, down from 2.5% previously. The outlook for 2017 growth was cut to 2.4% from 2.7%.",

Financial markets are not pricing in a rise for another two years.</p> <p>After a tumultuous start to the year on financial markets thanks to jitters over China\u2019s economic slowdown, the Bank predicted that emerging economies were likely to grow more slowly than in recent years and that global growth would be \u201conly modest\u201d. </p> <p>But Carney said the UK was well placed to cope with global headwinds thanks to high employment, strong domestic demand and a better capitalised banking sector.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs one of the most open economies in the world, the UK cannot help but be affected by an unforgiving global environment and sustained financial market turbulence,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cHowever, our prospects for a continued solid expansion are underpinned by the resilience built over the past seven years.\u201d</p> <p>The governor\u2019s remarks came alongside the Bank\u2019s quarterly deluge of documents, including minutes from the latest interest rate decision and the inflation report with forecasts for the economy.</p> <p>The pound initially weakened against the euro and the US dollar as those minutes revealed that policymaker Ian McCafferty dropped his recent backing for a rate rise. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/14/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-hold-mpc\">He had voted against</a> the eight other members of the monetary policy committee since last August, but this month agreed with his colleagues that it was too soon to raise interest rates.</p> <p>Sterling later bounced back as traders digested Carney\u2019s message that interest rates were more likely to rise than fall. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/04/markets-bank-of-england-interest-rate-business-live\">Bank of England cuts growth forecasts and leaves rates on hold - live updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Bank softened its outlook for inflation, which has been close to zero for a year as global commodity prices have tumbled. At 0.2% in December, it was well below the Bank\u2019s target of 2%, measured on the consumer prices index (CPI).</p> <p>\u201cThe scale of recent commodity price falls means that CPI inflation is likely to remain below 1% until the end of the year,\u201d the <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2016/feb.pdf\">inflation report (pdf) said</a>.</p> <p>One of the key factors behind McCafferty\u2019s change of heart and the Bank\u2019s softer inflation forecasts was lacklustre wage growth. That had come in weaker than the MPC had been expecting and policymakers were cautious about predicting any significant pick-up over the coming months.<br></p> <p>They noted signs that wage negotiations were being affected by low inflation, with employers perhaps less generous and workers being less demanding given that they were enjoying a boost to household budgets from cheaper fuel and food.<br></p> <p>As headline inflation picked up, nominal wage growth would \u201cin all likelihood\u201d increase. However, the MPC said there were downside risks to such a view.</p> <p>On the outlook for economic growth, the Bank repeatedly used the word \u201cresilient\u201d with regard to household and business spending. But the MPC cut its forecasts and now expects GDP growth of 2.2% this year, down from 2.5% previously. The outlook for 2017 growth was cut to 2.4% from 2.7%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Imagine, for a minute, the following scenario. A fleet of shining chauffeured limousines pulls up. One by one, some of the Wall Street\u2019s richest and most powerful folks slide out of the back seats and, glancing around them to ensure they aren\u2019t being observed, quickly enter a mansion to attend a secret meeting. It may sound like a scene from a movie, and eerily like the events from the 1957 high-level mafia get-together at a sleepy upstate New York hamlet that finally confirmed the existence of organized crime. But it really happened, first last August, and again last December, in New York City. Whether you believe it or not, the point of the hush-hush gathering wasn\u2019t to corner the gold market or any such silliness, but to protect us all from the more toxic elements in the financial world, and their short-term thinking. The Wall Street representatives participating in what one newspaper has described as \u201csecret summit meetings\u201d included Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, Warren Buffett and the heads of three of the world\u2019s four largest asset management firms. Their ranks may include some of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals (Forbes ranked Buffett as the third richest person on the planet last year) and Wall Street\u2019s most handsomely paid (Dimon just got a 35% pay hike for his performance last year, and will pocket $27m), but they still want to Do Good (and Prosper, of course). Specifically, the group is throwing its considerable weight behind a not-unfamiliar argument among financial circles: that there is too much short-term thinking around. This, they argue, isn\u2019t good for business, and it\u2019s bad for long-term investors, those who buy a stock and stick around for the long haul. The secret summits bore their first public fruit this week, when Larry Fink, co-founder and CEO of BlackRock, sent a letter to every single CEO of the 500 companies in the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, and a number of large European companies as well. Among other initiatives, Fink argued that it\u2019s time to dump the automatic practice of providing the market with quarterly earnings forecasts. This, he contends, results in a \u201cculture of quarterly earnings hysteria (that is) totally contrary to the long-term approach we need\u201d. Another trend that needs to come to an end, Fink said, is the instinct on the part of CEOs and chief financial officers to pay out sky-high proportions of their earnings in the form of dividends. In 2015, dividends accounted for the highest proportion of corporate earnings that they have since 2009, while buybacks \u2013 another \u201cshareholder friendly\u201d move \u2013 are up 27% in the last year alone. \u201cWe certainly support returning excess cash to shareholders, but not at the expense of value-creating investment,\u201d Fink said. The coterie pushing for less short-termism and more long-term thinking on the part of corporate America refer only in passing to the alternative \u2013 Fink nods in the direction of the existence of \u201cinvestors focused on maximizing near-term profit at the expense of long-term value\u201d and the risk that corporations may respond to the demands of these shareholders with \u201cpotentially destabilizing\u201d actions. But their opposition is clear: the activist hedge funds who have become a public and vocal force over the last decade. What\u2019s taking shape is a war between two camps on Wall Street that could, in its own way, be just as prolonged and bloody as any mafia clan war. On the one hand are the establishment forces \u2013 call them \u201cOld Wall Street\u201d \u2013 like the banks and the buy and hold investors. They are taking direct aim at former close allies and still lucrative clients, the $2.9tn hedge fund industry. Virtually all hedge fund strategies, to some extent, emphasize short-term returns; it\u2019s almost inevitable when managers charge hefty fees, leaving their own investors agitating for quarterly, market-beating returns. The hedge fund universe also includes many activist investors, such as Carl Icahn and Pershing Square\u2019s Bill Ackman, who will push for radical changes in order to ensure that their investments pay off. These activists may try to get the CEO to sell an underperforming division, announce a dividend and undertake other short-term initiatives that the market will love, driving the share price higher. They can then capture the profits and move on to their next \u201cinvestment\u201d idea. Some academics who have studied the phenomenon praise them; at least one has suggested activists may be the \u201cgrave-diggers of public corporations\u201d. These hedge funds may only acquire small stakes, but often end up with seats on the board and have very loud voices. (Carl Icahn has 270,000 Twitter followers, and claims to make money \u201cstudying natural stupidity\u201d.) In the absence of other voices, they insist that they can speak for all shareholders, and insist that their view of the strategic options available is the correct one. Until now, institutions have taken a back seat, allowing the hedge funds to set the agenda and dictate the outcome. The pushback by the old guard comes at an interesting time. Hedge funds as a group are struggling with poor performance, and some are being forced to close their doors. \u201cHedge fund hotel\u201d stocks \u2013 companies like Valeant that earned their name hosting scores, if not hundreds of hedge fund investors \u2013 tanked in the second half of 2015, causing double-digit losses. When Ackman had to disclose late last month just how badly he\u2019d done for his investors in 2015 (a 20.5% loss, after fees), he took the opportunity to lash out at Wall Street\u2019s old guard and at least one form of long-term investing. It seems that Ackman believes that one reason his big, concentrated bets didn\u2019t work out as planned was the growing popularity of indexing \u2013 the ultimate long-term investment strategy. Unsurprisingly, among those offering index funds are precisely those asset management companies who attended those secret summit meetings, BlackRock among them. Now, indexing is a cheap way for ordinary investors to get exposure to a wide array of companies at a very low cost. (While Ackman charges his investors 2%, you\u2019d pay about 0.07% for a good S&amp;P 500 fund.) But Ackman argues that as more capital flows to index funds \u2013 20% of every new dollar invested last year ended up in one \u2013 we\u2019re on the verge of an indexing \u201cbubble\u201d. And he contends that this hurts investors by keeping corporate managers in place, concentrating corporate power. The old alliance between old and new Wall Street is crumbling, and a civil war is about to ignite, it seems. But you and I aren\u2019t just audience members. We\u2019re the investors in whose interests both groups claim to be fighting. Activists like Ackman and Icahn contend that only they, with their saber-rattling and demands for sweeping corporate changes, can deliver big improvements for us (and oh yes, for their investors as well, but let\u2019s not mention that). Meanwhile, the old guard warns that if we succumb to the allure of short-termism, we\u2019ll be demanding that the companies whose stocks we own fail to invest for the future. At least, unlike the mafia wars, there won\u2019t be bloodshed.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shell has promised to dispose of a further $10bn of assets this year but insisted it does \u201cnot intend to hold a fire sale\u201d. The sell-off commitment came as the Anglo-Dutch group reported an 87% collapse in annual profits to $1.9bn just as it completes its \u00a335bn takeover of rival BG. Ben van Beurden, the Shell chief executive, had previously said the group wanted $30bn of asset sales following the BG deal and he now expects a third to come in the next 12 months without losing out on price. \u201cWe do not intend to hold a fire sale. We don\u2019t have to,\u201d Van Beurden insisted while saying a general slump in costs across the industry had meant that the business was now making money again in the central North Sea. Shell reported that quarterly earnings fell by 58% to $939m although the underlying profit of $1.8bn was in line with expectations. Shell has been hammered by a collapse in oil prices which has left the key North Sea Brent crude as low as $32 per barrel in recent days. On Tuesday, BP unveiled the worst annual loss in its history at $6.5bn while Conoco in the US has just cut its dividend. The company\u2019s share price closed up more than 6% at \u00a315.26, as commodity companies rallied on the back of rising oil prices. It is still down more than 10% since the start of the year. Van Beurden said he was committed to make \u201csubstantial changes\u201d to cope with the lower cost of crude but has not increased the total number of job losses planned, with 7,500 gone and 2,800 still to come. \u201cThe completion of the BG transaction, which we are expecting in a matter of weeks, marks the start of a new chapter in Shell, rejuvenating the company, and improving shareholder returns,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are making substantial changes in the company, reorganising our upstream, and reducing costs and capital investment, as we refocus Shell and respond to lower oil prices.\u201d The latest figures from Shell show quarterly oil and gas production down 5% and put quarterly cash flow from operating activities at $5.4bn with annual spending at $28.9bn, down 23% on the year before. Over the last year Shell has ditched its controversial exploratory drilling operation in the Arctic and postponed or scrapped projects such as the LNG Bab gas field in Abu Dhabi and Canada LNG. The company took a final investment decision on only four new projects last year and few are expected to be approved in 2016. This strategy has started to drag down Shell\u2019s reserve replacement ratio, a metric used to reflect new reserves added relative to the amount produced, down to 48%, even lower than BP. Despite the dismal financial results, Van Beurden announced the 2015 annual dividend would be held at $1.88 and \u201cis expected to be at least $1.88 per share in 2016\u201d. The Shell boss was reluctant to predict the direction of future oil prices but he expected them to start moving up from Thursday\u2019s level of mid-$34 towards $50 over the next 12 to 18 months. The BG merger still needs a low $60 oil price to make sense but the Shell boss said this was a long-term assessment and he remained confident the deal was advantageous to shareholders. Asked at a briefing whether the company would urge British voters to reject Brexit in a referendum vote, Van Beurden said it was up to the public to decide but added: \u201cIt would be bad for the European Union. It would not be a good thing for Shell.\u201d Meanwhile, Greenpeace said the collapse of profits at oil companies was a result of making the wrong decisions on fossil fuels. \u201cOil giants like Shell and BP are already paying a huge price for failing to bring their businesses into the 21st century,\u201d said Greenpeace\u2019s senior climate adviser Charlie Kronick. \u201cThe more electric cars, solar panels, and better-insulated homes we have, the less fossil fuels we\u2019re going to need and the less they\u2019re going to be worth. Shell and BP have bet heavily on the wrong energy sources, and now they\u2019re losing big.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Analysts at Goldman Sachs are warning that sterling could fall by up to 20% if Britain votes to leave the European Union. The US investment bank believes Britain will remain in the EU, but its macro markets strategy team has looked at what would happen to the pound if the vote goes the other way. It predicts that such an outcome would alarm foreign investors and put them off injecting capital into Britain, placing pressure on the current account deficit. Analysts George Cole, Robin Brooks and Michael Cahill wrote in a research note: \u201cA vote for the UK to exit from the EU is an event that would increase uncertainty, weigh on the UK outlook and raise concerns of foreign investors \u2013 potentially interrupting the flow of capital to the UK, sending the pound much lower.\u201d They estimate that a Brexit vote could lead to a short-term drop in trade-weighted sterling of 15-20%. This would take the pound down to $1.15-1.20 from $1.4565 at the moment and push the euro up to 90-95p from 76p. The Goldman team said: \u201cWe argue that, if the UK voted to leave the EU, the UK\u2019s current account deficit would still be a source of vulnerability despite some recent improvement. An abrupt and total interruption to incoming capital flows in response to a \u2018Brexit\u2019 could see the pound decline by as much as 15-20%.\u201d Last week, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, warned that concerns about Brexit could test \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d \u2013 with the UK dependent on inflows of foreign capital to fund its hefty current account deficit with the rest of the world. Britain\u2019s current account deficit has narrowed over the past year to 3.7% of GDP from 6%. Since November, the pound has fallen 5% as expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates this year have receded and the Brexit debate starts to heat up. The Goldman team noted that the pound tumbled 20% on a trade-weighted basis during the global financial crisis between July 2008 and March 2009, and the current account deficit moved from 3.4% of GDP to virtually zero. However, the analysts added that their forecasts are \u201cbased on a view that the UK will remain in the EU and that, as a result, the underlying dynamics will remain solid in the UK economy\u201d. They continue to forecast the pound at $1.40 and the euro at 68p in 12 months\u2019 time. Goldman Sachs is backing the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign and has made a substantial donation, believed to be a six-figure sum.",

      "bodyText": "E.ON and Age UK should refund pensioners who were overcharged for fuel under a scheme involving the charity, a member of a parliamentary energy committee has said. The Conservative MP Dan Poulter said there was a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d for the company, one of the big six energy suppliers, and the UK\u2019s largest pensioner charity to recompense energy users because they appeared to have paid hundreds of pounds too much over the last year. The Sun newspaper claimed that Age UK recommended a special rate from E.ON costing pensioners \u00a31,049 a year \u2013 \u00a3245 more than its cheapest rate. It said the charity received about \u00a341 from E.ON for every person it signed up to the deal, totalling \u00a36m a year. \u201cThis [special tariff agreed by E.ON and Age UK] is not a good deal for old people \u2026 many of whom may be in fuel poverty,\u201d Poulter told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, adding: \u201cThere is a moral obligation for the charity and E.ON to recompense them.\u201d The energy regulator, Ofgem, has already promised to investigate the scheme but both E.ON and Age UK insist it was a good deal. Age UK told the BBC: \u201cWe strongly reject the allegations and interpretation of figures in this article. Energy prices change all the time and we have always advised older people to look out for new good deals and we will continue to do so.\u201d E.ON argued the \u00a31,049 annual deal was a two-year fixed deal which, although more expensive than its cheapest rate, was favoured by some customers because it provided longer-term certainty over potential price increases. The company said: \u201cWe always work to make sure our tariffs, for all customers, are competitively priced and that is further evidenced by the fact that our current Age UK tariff was the UK\u2019s cheapest product of its type in the UK when it was launched.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On Tuesday, the governor of the Reserve Bank adopted a cautiously optimistic tone when announcing that interest rates would be kept on hold at 2%. But any feelings of optimism were pretty quickly snuffed out, when less than 24 hours later, data on exports and building approvals showed a rather gloomier picture. In his interest rates statement, Glenn Stevens noted that \u201cthe expansion in the non-mining parts of the economy strengthened during 2015\u201d and that \u201csurveys of business conditions moved to above average levels, employment growth picked up and the unemployment rate declined in the second half of the year\u201d. In a period where there are economic troubles overseas and a fair bit of red ink on stock markets here and abroad, it was about as upbeat as a central banker could get. All in all, on Tuesday, the view was \u2013 despite some troubles and turbulences \u2013 things were doing OK. And then on Wednesday in the midst of what is supposed to be the export stage of the mining boom, the ABS recorded that in December Australia had its largest ever trade deficit in trend terms: In December, Australia imported $29,257m worth of goods and services and exported $25,934m for a deficit of $3,313m. We need to remember that we\u2019re talking current dollars so the figures are generally bigger now than in the past. Generally, what is important is the size of the deficit relative to the size of our GDP, rather than nominal dollar values. But even still, when exports are driving our economic growth, it\u2019s not great news to see that our trade deficit is widening. And importantly, it is not widening just because our imports are growing, but because exports are falling: Since the end of 2013, the value of our exports has been declining, while the value of all the stuff we import has been rising. In December, there was actually a small 0.5% drop in imports, but exports fell by 1.2%. Imports rising can be a sign of economic health \u2013 it can mean firms are importing large capital goods. In 2004 and 2005, our imports were growing annually by 15% \u2013 much more than the current 3%. But back then the rise in imports was as much from capital goods \u2013 ie things used to make or build other things \u2013 as it was consumption goods. But in the past 12 months, the imports of capital goods has fallen by 1% whereas the imports of consumption goods rose 13%. The decline in the value of our exports pretty much comes down to one thing \u2013 the decline in commodity prices. In the past two years, the price of coal has dropped 38%, LNG has fallen 47%, and iron ore \u2013 our largest export item \u2013 has fallen 70% since December 2013: That means the volume of exports needs to increase to counter those falls. And while the volume of exports has risen \u2013 for example the volume of iron ore exported rose by 4% in December, and the quantity of LNG exports rose 5% \u2013 the falls in prices have been too large to counter that. And not surprisingly, that has seen falls in the value of those exports: The value of iron ore exported in December was the lowest monthly total since March 2010, and in the 12 months to December, the $48.86bn of iron ore exported was the lowest 12 month total since November 2010. As real GDP is concerned with volume rather than value, exports should still contribute to GDP growth in the December quarter, but by less than what occurred in September. And the falling value should see nominal GDP growth once again well below average. It comes at a time when our mining exports are vitally important. In 2015, mining exports accounted for around 45% of all our exports. Combined with our rural exports, this accounts for around 60% of our export base: That\u2019s not particularly good as it make us rather susceptible to falls in commodity prices and the impacts of droughts and other violent weather events. Back in 1986, when Paul Keating famously referred to Australia being in danger of becoming a banana republic, it was due to a large increase in our trade deficit, falling commodity prices, and our narrow export base. He noted then \u201cit\u2019s the old cargo cult mentality of Australia that she\u2019ll be right. This is the lucky country, we can dig up another mound of rock and someone will buy it from us, or we can sell a bit of wheat and a bit of wool and we will just sort of muddle through\u201d. Back in the mid 1980s, more of our exports came from both mining and the rural sector, but now they are much more dependent on mining. In fact, the only reason mining is less than half of our total exports is because of the fall in commodity prices in the past two years. So we\u2019re in a situation where we are more dependent than ever on mining, but commodity prices are falling. Our largest export partner, China, is experiencing slowing growth and a shrinking manufacturing sector, and our next biggest trading partner, Japan, is doing so badly that its central bank has set interest rates effectively in negative territory. But not to worry, our housing market will see us through, right? Well, as I noted last month, there is currently a good deal of housing construction going on, but mostly in the form of apartments. And so great has been the surge in apartment construction, that there are very real concerns of a glut occurring, causing a fall in prices and also a drop in construction. National Australia Bank this week released its latest residential property survey which saw analysts expecting a decided cooling of housing prices. The NAB chief economist Alan Oster noted that \u201clarge existing pipeline of residential construction, especially in the apartment market, should see average national house price growth slow to just 1% (2.3% previously), with weaker expectations in all capital cities (particularly Sydney and Melbourne)\u201d. And the impacts of this cooling are now being seen. The latest building approvals data were also released, showing that for the first time since March 2012 the annual growth in approvals for non-house dwellings in trend terms has fallen. While there was a sharp increase in the approvals of apartments in seasonally adjusted terms, that measure is very erratic, whereas in trend terms, monthly apartment building approvals have fallen for nine straight months. This won\u2019t flow through construction activity for a while, but it does signal a pretty strong pause in the housing boom: So to recap: falling export values, and a slowing of the housing construction sector in the near future. Oh well, at least this week we had one day of seeing the glass half full.",

Combined with our rural exports, this accounts for around 60% of our export base:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breakdown of Australia's exports.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IKLgT/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s not particularly good as it make us rather susceptible to falls in commodity prices and the impacts of droughts and other violent weather events.</p> <p>Back in 1986, when Paul Keating famously referred to Australia being in danger of becoming a banana republic, it was due to a large increase in our trade deficit, falling commodity prices, and our narrow export base. </p> <p>He noted then \u201cit\u2019s the old cargo cult mentality of Australia that she\u2019ll be right. This is the lucky country, we can dig up another mound of rock and someone will buy it from us, or we can sell a bit of wheat and a bit of wool and we will just sort of muddle through\u201d.</p> <p>Back in the mid 1980s, more of our exports came from both mining and the rural sector, but now they are much more dependent on mining. In fact, the only reason mining is less than half of our total exports is because of the fall in commodity prices in the past two years. </p> <p>So we\u2019re in a situation where we are more dependent than ever on mining, but commodity prices are falling. Our largest export partner, China, is experiencing slowing growth and a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-01/china-factory-gauge-falls-a-sixth-month-extends-record-stretch\">shrinking manufacturing sector</a>, and our next biggest trading partner, Japan, is doing so badly that its central bank has set <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/29/bank-of-japan-shocks-markets-by-adopting-negative-interest-rates\">interest rates effectively in negative</a> territory.</p> <p>But not to worry, our housing market will see us through, right?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/02/the-key-to-australias-economic-success-locking-in-low-inflation\">The key to Australia's economic success: locking in low inflation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Well, as I noted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jan/21/apartment-building-is-booming-so-betting-on-a-rate-cut-isnt-as-safe-as-houses\">last month</a>, there is currently a good deal of housing construction going on, but mostly in the form of apartments. And so great has been the surge in apartment construction, that there are very real concerns of a glut occurring, causing a fall in prices and also a drop in construction. </p> <p>National Australia Bank this week released its latest <a href=\"http://business.nab.com.au/nab-quarterly-australian-residential-property-survey-q4-2015-15021/\">residential property survey</a> which saw analysts expecting a decided cooling of housing prices. </p> <p>The NAB chief economist Alan Oster noted that \u201clarge existing pipeline of residential construction, especially in the apartment market, should see average national house price growth slow to just 1% (2.3% previously), with weaker expectations in all capital cities (particularly Sydney and Melbourne)\u201d.</p> <p>And the impacts of this cooling are now being seen. The latest <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/8731.0Main+Features1Dec%25202015?OpenDocument\">building approvals data were also released</a>, showing that for the first time since March 2012 the annual growth in approvals for non-house dwellings in trend terms has fallen.</p> <p>While there was a sharp increase in the approvals of apartments in seasonally adjusted terms, that measure is very erratic, whereas in trend terms, monthly apartment building approvals have fallen for nine straight months.</p> <p>This won\u2019t flow through construction activity for a while, but it does signal a pretty strong pause in the housing boom: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of private sector building approvals.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/liIs4/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So to recap: falling export values, and a slowing of the housing construction sector in the near future. </p> <p>Oh well, at least this week we had one day of seeing the glass half full. </p>",
