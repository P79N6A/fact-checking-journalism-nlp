      "bodyText": "George Soros has moved to defy his critics over his \u00a3400,000 donation to the pro-EU campaign group Best for Britain by pledging an additional \u00a3100,000 to support efforts to fight Brexit. The billionaire investor\u2019s Open Society Foundation (OSF) is set to match a crowdfunding campaign set up in the wake of attacks on Soros, which has already raised more than \u00a350,000 since his support was revealed on Wednesday last week. Soros, who has given much of his personal wealth to OSF, said his money was directly linked to the campaign against him in the rightwing press, where a Daily Telegraph article accused him of a secret plot to stop Brexit and described him as \u201ca rich gambler \u2026 accused of meddling in nation\u2019s affairs\u201d. \u201cI am happy to take the fight to those who have tried to use a smear campaign, not arguments, to prop up their failing case,\u201d Soros told the Guardian. A former refugee from communist Hungary who made $1bn (\u00a3720m) as a currency speculator betting against sterling on Black Wednesday, Soros has said leaving the EU would be a tragic mistake that would weaken Britain\u2019s influence. Best for Britain\u2019s chief executive, Eloise Todd, said the extra funds were a rebuff to those who said his funding for the campaign was anti-democratic. \u201cWe live in a democracy, and the right to freedom of speech is precious. Elements of the rightwing press don\u2019t seem to agree,\u201d Todd said. \u201cThe UK\u2019s future with the EU is not a done deal, there is still a vote to come and people across the country deserve to know the truth about the options on the table, one of which is staying and leading in the EU. \u201cGeorge Soros and his foundation is kindly offering to help match-fund to give Best for Britain more support so we can make sure this message gets out, the biggest decision on Brexit is yet to come.\u201d More than 1,300 people have donated to Best for Britain\u2019s GoFundMe page since Wednesday, when Soros\u2019s donation was first publicised in a Telegraph article co-authored by Theresa May\u2019s former chief of staff, Nick Timothy. Soros\u2019s contribution was also criticised in the Daily Mail, which called it \u201ctainted money\u201d. Some have said the language used in attacks on Soros echoes the antisemitic campaign against him made by nationalist groups and governments in eastern European countries such as Hungary and Russia, where OSF has supported civil society groups. Soros\u2019s foundation has given cash to a variety of anti-Brexit groups, including \u00a3182,000 for the European Movement UK and \u00a335,000 to Scientists for EU. OSF said it had also given the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue \u00a386,000 to campaign for the protection of rights currently enshrined in European law. The additional \u00a3100,000 for Best for Britain will bring OSF\u2019s total funding for pro-Europe campaigns and organisations to more than \u00a3800,000. OSF\u2019s president, Patrick Gaspard, said the funds were for \u201cBritish groups striving to ensure that this crucial debate is not shut down\u201d and that no cash had gone to parliamentarians. Best for Britain, which advocates remaining in the EU rather than fighting for a soft Brexit, received the \u00a3400,000 donation after the June election, having previously crowdfunded a similar amount to launch a tactical voting campaign to support pro-European politicians from a variety of parties. The campaign is chaired by Mark Malloch Brown, a former UK government minister and deputy UN secretary general. It was co-founded by Gina Miller, who took the UK government to court over the triggering of the article 50 process to leave the EU. Miller has since said she is no longer part of the organisation, which she has accused of being undemocratic. Soros wrote an article for the Mail on Sunday in which he voiced dismay at the \u201ctoxic attacks\u201d on him and his foundation over the past week. The 87-year-old said it was crucial to attempt to change people\u2019s minds about leaving the EU. A mere reversal of the 52-48 majority for Brexit would not be enough to settle the issue, he said. \u201cThe majority for staying would have to be significantly larger to convince Europe that Britain\u2019s attitude towards Europe has fundamentally changed and its decision deserves to be taken seriously.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket group is understood to be working on a secret plan to develop a new discount grocery chain to take on cut-price chains Aldi and Lidl. Tesco is said to be developing a separate brand that would match the German discounters on price in a bid to halt the constant drift of customers away to the cheaper rivals. The new chain would offer a far more limited range of products than the average Tesco store, at around 3,000 compared with the 25,000 diferent items often available in a Tesco Extra. The retailer is reported to have hired advisers from Boston Consulting Group to work on the plans. It has asked a number of key own-label suppliers to sign non-disclosure agreements before contributing to a new project, according to a report in The Sunday Times. Indicating the scale of the threat posed to the supermarket chains by the discounters, the Guardian understands a second option has also been under consideration, which would involve a new \u201cCostco-type bulk purchase brand\u201d, similar to a business Tesco already has in Thailand. Tesco declined to comment on any moves, but last week revealed it planned to \u201cdevelop new formats to better serve customers\u201d. Aldi and Lidl have been winning shoppers from the big four supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 since the last recession when rising food prices encouraged Britons to shop around for their groceries. Aldi overtook the Co-op in 2017 to become the UK\u2019s fifth-largest grocer, having surpassed Waitrose in 2015. The most recent figures from grocery industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel show Aldi\u2019s market share reached 6.9% in the 12 weeks to 28 January, up from 6.2% a year ago. Lidl increased its stake from 4.5% to 5% over the same period. By comparison Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons have all lost market share over the past year. Previous attempts by UK supermarkets to launch discount brands have failed. However, experts said the recent tie-up between Tesco and the wholesaler Booker, which already has its own discount branded products, could be a major advantage. Tesco has been trying to re-establish its previous dominance in the face of stiff competition from the German discounters. Shoppers faced with declining incomes flocked to Aldi and Lidl when the financial crisis first hit, and many kept returning. The way consumers do their food shopping is also changing rapidly. Fewer people now do a big weekly shop at an out-of-town superstore, preferring to buy food more regularly and more locally. Big superstores have also been hit by an increase in spending on takeaways and more online food shopping, to the extent that the big supermarket groups are now trying to lure in other retailers to fill shopfloor space they no longer need. Last year it emerged that Aldi and Lidl now account for \u00a31 in every \u00a38 spent in UK supermarkets. Tesco suffered a string of profit warnings and an accounting scandal in 2014, caused in part by competitive pressure from the discounters. Under Dave Lewis, who replaced Philip Clarke as chief executive in 2014, the supermarket has sharpened prices and narrowed its product ranges slightly. A whole new brand, though, would be a major investment, say retail experts. Tesco last tried the discount route under the leadership of Sir Terry Leahy, but the move was abandoned because the management team at the time feared it might undermine the main brand. Sainbury\u2019s tried a similar venture in 2014 via a joint venture with Danish discount chain Netto. Two years later it was scrapped and the stores were eventually sold to Asda. Bryan Roberts, insights director at TCC Global, said the Tesco move sounded credible. \u201cThere were rumours that Tesco was planning something like this two or three years ago, and while Tesco undoubtedly has the buying buying power and expertise to make it work, recent history suggests these moves tend to fail in the UK. Discounters work in a fundamentally different way, and it can be hard to change the store management\u2019s philosophy,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The lack of women in energy companies is holding back the sector\u2019s efforts to tackle climate change, a leading industry watcher has warned. Catherine Mitchell, a professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter, said poor gender diversity meant the industry was less open to new ideas, in particular the move to a lower-carbon energy system. \u201cI absolutely do think that the fact that the industry is so dominated by men and particularly older white men it is slowing down the energy transition,\u201d said Mitchell, who has worked on energy issues for more than 30 years and advises the government, regulators and businesses. An energy conference featuring women-only panels is being held next month to address the lack of visibility of female leaders in the sector. \u201cI thought we really need to have something where all these women who are great get to speak,\u201d said Mitchell, who has helped organise the event. She admitted it was not a given that women are more progressive on energy issues than men, but noted that the \u201cconventional\u201d parts of the sector \u2013 fossil fuel power generation and energy networks \u2013 are more male-dominated than greener, innovative companies. \u201cThe fact we are not moving is not good for Britain, is not good for the environment,\u201d she said of attitudes slowing the transition to renewable and decentralised energy. Juliet Davenport, the chief executive of the energy supplier Good Energy, said the argument was credible. \u201cThe energy sector is lagging sorely behind other industries in terms of diversity, meanwhile sustainable [green] businesses are very balanced. So the idea that lack of diversity is contributing to the issue of transition to renewables is very plausible,\u201d she said. Nearly two-thirds of the leading 89 energy companies in the UK have no women on their boards and industry events with men-only panels, or just one woman, are common. One female energy expert said she had been disinvited from a panel of chief executives at an annual event after a company deputised a female executive. \u201cIt became a panel of CEOs, with a woman, and so they did not \u2018need\u2019 another woman,\u201d she said. Sometimes it is a case of being the only woman in the room. One senior female executive said she was the sole woman at a meeting hosted by an influential male government adviser in London. Sexual harassment is not unknown either: one female leader, who did not want to be named, said she was groped by the head of a trade body at an awards event several years ago. Felicity Jones, a partner at the renewables and energy storage consultancy Everoze, recalled being in a speaker\u2019s room at a conference when a fellow speaker asked for a coffee refill, assuming she was one of the catering staff. \u201cThat kind of thing happens, but I laugh it off. Because it works both ways: often my gender gives me an advantage. I do a lot of business development and pretty much all of my counterparts at competitors are men. That means that I stand out,\u201d she said. Occasionally, the lack of gender diversity breaks out in public. During a recent questioning of energy chiefs by MPs on the impact of a price cap, the Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach said: \u201cI am quite struck by the panel. We have four men here.\u201d Sandbach went on to scold the retail chief executive of SSE, Stephen Forbes, for the company\u2019s 19.4% gender pay gap, a figure he attempted to defend. Some in the industry are making an effort to address the problem, such as the big six lobby group Energy UK, which has banned men-only panels at its events. \u201cThe energy sector is undergoing a huge period of transition, which brings with it a huge opportunity to increase gender balance,\u201d said the group\u2019s external affairs director, Abbie Sampson.",

      "bodyText": "The Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros has said he is proud to have given \u00a3400,000 to an anti-Brexit campaign, saying it was his affection for the UK that prompted his decision. Soros, a former refugee from communist Hungary who made $1bn (\u00a3720m) as a currency speculator betting against sterling on Black Wednesday, said leaving the EU was a tragic mistake which would weaken Britain. The investor has come under sustained attack since details of his donations to Best for Britain were revealed last week. Soros, who has given much of his personal fortune to his human rights organisation, the Open Society Foundations (OSF), said he had received \u201ctoxic personal criticism\u201d. Some have said the language echoes the antisemitic attacks against him made by some governments, such as Hungary and Russia. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, he said Best for Britain had his wholehearted support and that he had made no secret of his opposition to Brexit. \u201cThis process will change Britain and Europe from friends into foes, at least during the transitional period,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore the referendum Britain was doing better economically than the rest of Europe. But this has now been reversed, with continental economies powering ahead while Britain lags behind.\u201d Soros said he believed it was crucial to attempt to change people\u2019s minds about leaving the EU. Referendum votes often saw one side \u201cegged on by unscrupulous agitators\u201d he said, adding that \u201cpeople use them to express their dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs rather than contemplating the consequences\u201d. The 87-year-old said he was also concerned about the divisions between rich and poor over Brexit. \u201cOld voters have overruled young voters who will have to live with the consequences of Brexit for decades ahead. This is aggravating the disillusionment with democracy among young people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a mere reversal of the 52:48 majority for Brexit is not enough. The majority for staying would have to be significantly larger to convince Europe that Britain\u2019s attitude towards Europe has fundamentally changed and its decision deserves to be taken seriously.\u201d Soros said he believed public opinion was slowly shifting in Britain, but that time was running out and a tipping point needed to be reached in the next six to nine months. \u201cBest for Britain seeks to break the logjam by bringing together all the various forces that are united by their aspiration for Britain to remain part of Europe. It has my wholehearted support,\u201d he said. Best for Britain, which advocates remaining in the EU rather than fighting for a soft Brexit, received the six-figure sum from OSF since the June 2017 election. The campaign is chaired by Mark Malloch-Brown, a former UK government minister and deputy UN secretary general. It was co-founded by Gina Miller, who took the UK government to court over the triggering of the article 50 process to leave the EU. Miller has since said she is no longer part of the organisation, which she has accused of being undemocratic. Lord Malloch-Brown said the campaign group had followed all rules and regulations governing financial contribution. \u201cWe, like millions of people, believe that Britain should lead, not leave, Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe work with campaigners, businesses, unions, politicians and community groups to make sure everyone has a strong campaigning voice,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "The stock market turmoil was all about good economic news | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Christine Lagarde had good news to tell when she turned up in Davos three weeks ago to announce the International Monetary Fund\u2019s latest economic forecasts. The global economy was doing better than expected pretty much everywhere, the IMF\u2019s managing director said. There was, though, another message, a warning not to get too carried away about a recovery that had left out large numbers of people and was not based on particularly solid foundations. \u201cThere is also significant uncertainty in the year ahead,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cThe long period of low interest rates has led to a buildup of potentially serious financial sector vulnerabilities.\u201d The IMF does not always get it right but on this occasion Lagarde nailed it. Over the past week, shares on Wall Street have fallen sharply, with the Dow Jones recording 1,000-point-plus declines on two separate days. Speaking in Dubai on Sunday, in her first public comments since the market turmoil, Lagarde said she remained \u201creasonably optimistic\u201d but that \u201cwe cannot sit back and wait for growth to continue as normal\u201d. Somewhat perversely, the markets came down for the same reason as they rose steadily throughout 2017: because of the brighter economic news Lagarde reported. The trigger for the sell-off was a US labour market report, which showed more jobs being created, wages going up and unemployment at 4.1%. Most Americans would struggle to work out why this would cause share prices to plunge. After all, unemployment has been coming down steadily for years, during which time US workers have struggled to make ends meet. Annual earnings growth is still running below 3%. But from the perspective of Wall Street, these are now seen as unwelcome developments. In 2017, the financial markets bought shares because they thought the US was in for a prolonged period of strong growth, weak inflation and low interest rates. The moment the jobs report came out it was as though a switch had been flipped. Markets now viewed stronger US growth with trepidation because they thought it would result in higher inflation and tougher action from the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. Donald Trump\u2019s package of tax cuts, finally pushed through Congress at the end of last year, ceased to be the growth-boosting, productivity enhancing benefit to the economy it had been in 2017 and suddenly became a means of overheating the economy and driving up the US budget deficit. Because Washington would need to borrow more to bridge the gap between its spending and its tax revenue, the assumption was that interest rates would need to rise. As it happens, some of Wall Street\u2019s assumptions are questionable. Take the idea that America is running at full employment, for example, where the 4.1% jobless rate masks the fact that labour market participation has yet to get back to where it was at the start of the Great Recession a decade ago. America\u2019s employment rate is currently just over 60% \u2013 3 percentage points lower than it was in 2008. Nor was the rise in wages quite all that it seemed, since most of the beneficiaries were those in senior positions. Annual earnings growth for those in \u201cproduction non-supervisory\u201d positions \u2013 the bottom 83% of the jobs market \u2013 was 2.4%. But Wall Street\u2019s assumption that the Federal Reserve is keen to raise interest rates is correct. The City is getting a similar message from the Bank of England, that UK borrowing costs might need to go up faster than hitherto expected. There is no suggestion that interest rates will need to rise to their pre-crisis levels. Indeed, both the Fed and the Bank of England have been at pains to point out that the tightening of policy will be gradual and modest. Threadneedle Street probably envisages raising rates to around 2.5% in quarter-point steps over the coming years, which would leave them well below the 5% average since the Bank was founded in 1694. Yet even this looks quite a stretch. For almost a decade now, the major developed economies have relied on heavy doses of stimulus from their central banks to generate growth. Interest rates have had to be kept low and money printed on an enormous scale through the process known as quantitative easing because finance ministries have adopted austerity policies \u2013 higher taxes and cuts in public spending \u2013 in an attempt to reduce budget deficits. This mix of ultra-loose monetary policy and hardline fiscal policy was a mistake. It explains why the NHS \u2013 experiencing its toughest budgetary constraints since it was founded in 1948 \u2013 is struggling to cope with demand. It also explains why the only real signs of serious inflation in recent years have been for fine wine, expensive houses and old masters. There were gasps of surprise when Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Salvator Mundi was knocked down for $400m at auction last year, more than three times the price experts had predicted, but the explanation was obvious. Rockbottom interest rates and QE have driven up the price of assets sought by the already well off. It has been the classic case of too much money chasing too few goods. Elsewhere, it has been harder to find signs of overheating. In the UK, for example, food prices have risen by just 2% in the past three years even accounting for the increases that have resulted from the pound\u2019s post-EU referendum depreciation. Trump\u2019s tax cuts have been widely condemned and, to the extent that they are pro-rich, the criticism is justified. But in two respects they are welcome: they make growth a higher priority than deficit reduction and they provide a better balance between monetary and fiscal policy. Central banks have for too long been the only game in town, which makes raising interest rates problematic. They want scope to ease policy in the event of another recession, but if they are too hasty they themselves will be responsible for the downturn.",

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u2013 which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u2013 coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The IMF does not always get it right but on this occasion Lagarde nailed it. Over the past week, shares on Wall Street have fallen sharply, with the Dow Jones recording <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/08/dow-jones-sinks-again-as-bond-yields-rise-and-higher-inflation-feared\">1,000-point-plus declines on two separate days.</a><br></p> \n<p>Speaking in Dubai on Sunday, in her first public comments since the market turmoil, Lagarde said she remained \u201creasonably optimistic\u201d but that \u201cwe cannot sit back and wait for growth to continue as normal\u201d.</p> \n<p>Somewhat perversely, the markets came down for the same reason as they rose steadily throughout 2017: because of the brighter economic news Lagarde reported. The trigger for the sell-off was a US labour market report, which showed more jobs being created, wages going up and unemployment at 4.1%.</p> \n<p>Most Americans would struggle to work out why this would cause share prices to plunge. After all, unemployment has been coming down steadily for years, during which time US workers have struggled to make ends meet. Annual earnings growth is still running below 3%.<br></p> \n<p>But from the perspective of Wall Street, these are now seen as unwelcome developments. In 2017, the financial markets bought shares because they thought the US was in for a prolonged period of strong growth, weak inflation and low interest rates. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/10/turmoil-stock-markets-10-years-cheap-money-ends\">Test of nerve for markets as 10 years of cheap money come to an end</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The moment the jobs report came out it was as though a switch had been flipped. Markets now viewed stronger US growth with trepidation because they thought it would result in higher inflation and tougher action from the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. Donald Trump\u2019s package of tax cuts, finally pushed through Congress at the end of last year, ceased to be the growth-boosting, productivity enhancing benefit to the economy it had been in 2017 and suddenly became a means of overheating the economy and driving up the US budget deficit. Because Washington would need to borrow more to bridge the gap between its spending and its tax revenue, the assumption was that interest rates would need to rise.</p> \n<p>As it happens, some of Wall Street\u2019s assumptions are questionable. Take the idea that America is running at full employment, for example, where the 4.1% jobless rate masks the fact that labour market participation has yet to get back to where it was at the start of the Great Recession a decade ago. America\u2019s employment rate is currently just over 60% \u2013 3 percentage points lower than it was in 2008.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1a4c82a7-3e7d-44a8-8d40-18e25102ff4f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Inflation is when prices rise.

The spread-betting companies\u2019 reaction to these devastating moves? Almost blanket acceptance of the regulators\u2019 proposals \u2013 which rather suggests they knew what they\u2019d been getting away with for years. It is important to remember that financial spread betting has always been marketed as an investment product (unlike sports spread betting, which is flogged as a leisure activity), and certainly the financial spreads industry has made the odd player very rich.

Most spread-betting firms are sure the retail game is up, so are desperately looking to reinvent themselves as business-to-business trading platforms.

      "bodyText": "The railways and profit do not sit easily together, largely because a carriage load of other considerations need to be weighed first: safety, punctuality, affordability. The presence of private rail operators on our infrastructure is therefore contingent on the public accepting this added, complicating consideration. One way of keeping that delicate compact in place is to make clear to private rail companies, as would be the case in a purely commercial endeavour, that they are responsible for the risks they take. The east coast mainline debacle is an example of a business shunning that risk \u2013 and endangering the entire rationale of rail privatisation in the process. Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC), a joint venture between Scottish transport group Stagecoach and Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin group, signed an eight-year contract to operate the London-Edinburgh route and agreed to pay the government \u00a33.3bn over the lifetime of that deal. Last week the transport secretary confirmed that VTEC had breached its contract and the franchise would be scrapped. The punishment is likely to be the loss of a joint deposit worth \u00a3165m, plus a cash hit of \u00a319m for Stagecoach and further non-cash charge for the Scottish group of \u00a375m. Those are big numbers, but not big enough. VTEC has paid \u00a31bn to the government over its near three years of operation, which means the taxpayer is around \u00a32bn short. Neither Stagecoach founder Sir Brian Souter nor Branson, who have both made fortunes from rail, are on the hook for that \u00a32bn. At the extreme end of the punishment scale, they shouldn\u2019t have to liquidate their fortunes over misjudging the profitability of a contract with the public sector. But between losing their deposit and writing a cheque for \u00a32bn, there should have been weightier sanctions. The option of imposing a franchise-bidding moratorium on both companies was discarded on the same day as they lost the east coast last week, when it was announced that Virgin Trains\u2019 west coast operation \u2013 another joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin \u2013 had secured an extension. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, added that there was no legal precedent for barring both firms from bidding for other deals \u2013 much to the chagrin of his predecessor, Lord Adonis, who said he had blacklisted National Express for defaulting on the same east coast route in 2009. The efficient function of the franchise market, and the industry\u2019s funding assumptions, are threatened when bidders throw large sums at a contract in order to win it and are rewarded for failure with comparative lenience. The way Grayling handled the third default on an east coast mainline contract in 11 years will do nothing to discourage reckless bids for operating rail services when profitability should be far down the list of concerns. If private operators such as Stagecoach and Virgin want to guarantee a long-term future for the private sector in rail franchising, then heavier punishment is probably in their interests. It is not a question of wishing the private sector to fail, but that it must be seen to fail fairly when it does. The alternative is letting bad risk-taking go unpunished sequentially until public patience, perhaps under the relentless prodding of Adonis, snaps. And then Souter and Branson will have very little cover when passengers start to call for the return to public operation of key rail routes. Network Rail, the organisation behind Britain\u2019s tracks and stations, is already in public ownership and its record has been a vast improvement on what went on before. If there are more episodes like east coast mainline, voters will start to wonder if the same system will work for rail franchises. Musk boldly goes where no bean-counter has gone before For all the technological achievements of recent decades \u2013 the internet, artificial intelligence, electric cars \u2013 space travel remains peerless as a symbol of modern human endeavour. As an emblem of financial efficiency though, the point is moot. Nasa and the Soviet state pumped billions into projects whose primary value appeared to be to score interstellar points in the cold war. Nasa\u2019s investment over the years led to the invention of artificial limbs and scratch-free lenses (no, Teflon and Velcro were not discovered by Nasa) but those were ancillary benefits from the main goal: getting one over on the Kremlin. Does this mean that Elon Musk\u2019s ambition to put human beings on Mars should be treated with similar scepticism? Last week his privately owned company, SpaceX, managed to put the second-most powerful rocket in history, and a Tesla car, into orbit. Musk has stated with the characteristic hyperbole of an internet entrepreneur that his aim is nothing less than saving the planet. Rocket travel will help us become an apocalypse-dodging multiplanetary species, he claims \u2013 a loftier goal than blasting Marxism into the heart of the sun. Indeed, Musk rarely couches his space travel pitch in terms of profit. SpaceX needs to overcome fixed annual costs of around $900m (\u00a3640m) to make a profit (according to an internal memo written in 2013). That said, he has been helped massively by the multimillion-dollar Nasa contracts that have kept the company afloat. But he has taken on establishment naysayers nonetheless. South African-born Musk is a classic American entrepreneur in the mould of Jobs or Edison \u2013 acting on a hunch, not the desire for a fortune. Such is the vaulting nature of Musk\u2019s moonshot that perhaps only a risk-taker, putting their own money on the line, could pull it off. Energy giants must move fast Big Oil\u2019s leaders have spent a lot of the past fortnight talking about the crude-price recovery that has reaped them bumper profits. More surprisingly, large chunks of chief executives\u2019 speeches and presentations have been given over to their moves \u201cbeyond\u201d petroleum, following a \u201cbuzzing\u201d period of investments by oil companies in green energy firms. BP and Shell said they were looking to buy more, while Total chief Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 talked of expanding a profitable low-carbon business. ExxonMobil bowed to shareholder pressure and spelled out how climate-change action would affect its reserves, though it downplayed the impact as being of \u201clittle risk\u201d. The company\u2019s European peers deserve some credit for a better understanding of the fundamental risks to their businesses. While oil companies have been under pressure for years from investors and government regulations to take climate change more seriously, now the big driver is an economic one. Peak oil demand is a very real prospect in the next two decades. New technology will disrupt crude demand, from cars burning petrol and diesel much more efficiently, to the rapid uptake of electric vehicles and growing trends of ride-sharing and driverless cars. Energy demand growth will slow; government climate policies will bite. Now the challenge for the more progressive oil firms is to make their spending commensurate with the scale of the transition needed. A fraction of the billions they plan to spend pumping more crude in coming years is allocated for renewables and building the charging networks for electric cars. Buoyed by higher oil prices and the reduced costs of their operations, the majors are on the cusp of a new growth cycle. That growth needs to be in green gold, not black. Oil giants are changing. But not fast enough to avoid the climate change that will devastate both the world\u2019s poor and some of its richest: Big Oil\u2019s shareholders.",

      "bodyText": "When I was a schoolboy it was common practice to go to the cinema (or \u201cthe pictures\u201d, as we used to say) and arrive well after the start of a double bill. We would then stay until the action in the first film had reached the point where we had come in. As this country becomes the laughing stock of the world in regard to the so-called \u201cnegotiations\u201d about Brexit, we find that, hey presto, this is where we came in. For people urgently seeking a solution, not to say a squaring of the circle, membership of Efta, the European Free Trade Association, is often touted as the best option. But, to repeat, this is where we came in. After we had won the war \u2013 not alone, pace the Brexiters, but with considerable assistance from what were then still British empire forces and, eventually, the US \u2013 we had to come to terms with the economic consequences of the devastating cost of the war, and the dissolution of the empire. In economic terms, the empire had offered this country captive markets for its goods and ready sources of imported food and raw materials on favourable terms. Adapting to the end of empire became the common cause of politicians and civil servants alike. Despite the fact that Churchill had at one stage contemplated a union with France, as well as later calling for a United States of Europe, we regarded the setting-up of what was then known as the Common Market \u2013 the European Economic Community \u2013 with a certain disdain. It was a case of \u201cstart the revolution without us\u201d. It soon became apparent that the UK had made a mistake. The EEC was doing well, and outpacing the British economy. But we had missed the boat and joined Efta, a rival grouping. There were six members of the original EEC, and seven of Efta; this gave rise to the joke that Europe was \u201cat sixes and sevens\u201d. Efta did not prove good enough, but applications by prime ministers of both major parties \u2013 Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson \u2013 to join the EEC were turned down flat, and we eventually only joined as late as 1973, under Edward Heath. Well, the UK itself is at sixes and sevens at present. Although Efta would be better than nothing, it would be very much a second-best link to the single market, with our having precious little influence over future EU policy. But the Johnson/Gove/Rees-Mogg team would not be content with diminished influence over EU policy. No: they want no influence. They fantasise about being free of the imaginary constraints of the union, and breaking out so that we can increase our exports to China \u2013 notwithstanding the fact that, while allegedly constrained by the EU, German exports to China amount to many multiples of our own. I have little time for Johnson, Gove and the anachronistic Rees-Mogg. As the irrepressible Remainer Lord Adonis keeps pointing out, this trio have in effect been the egregious Nigel Farage\u2019s placemen in cabinet, exerting too much influence on a prime minister who ought to know better. In the 45 years of our membership of the EU, we have built up tens of thousands of links that it is absurd to try to remove. That is why Chancellor Hammond and other Remainers want to stay as close to the EU as possible \u2013 which really means that we should not be leaving at all. But Theresa May is so frightened of Johnson and co that she has still not got the point. She should re-read an infinitely more substantial Boris \u2013 Boris Pasternak \u2013 and his great novel Dr Zhivago: \u201cIt turns out that those who inspired the revolution aren\u2019t at home in anything except change and turmoil\u2026 For them, transitional periods... are an end in themselves... And do you know why there is this incessant whirl of never-ending preparations? It\u2019s because they haven\u2019t any real capacities, they are ungifted.\u201d This country is crying out for leadership, at the outset of potentially its greatest crisis since the second world war. If the Gadarene rush to Brexit is not stopped, the consequences for investment, trade and economic wellbeing are almost certain to be serious. The problem for those of us who have not given up the fight is that, although there are warning signs, the real economic damage from Brexit will only be apparent in the medium term. But even now, notwithstanding minor upward revisions to the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts, the economy which former chancellor George Osborne believes could become \u201cthe strongest in the world\u201d is falling behind mainland Europe. Moreover, every day brings news of threats to freedoms we take for granted. The price of the \u201cfreedom\u201d the Brexiters want to impose on us would be \u2013 well, less freedom. The new film about Churchill has been a great hit. There is not a Churchill among the Brexiters. It is time for the overwhelming majority of Remainers in parliament to stand up and be counted.",

Adapting to the end of empire became the common cause of politicians and civil servants alike.</p> <p>Despite the fact that Churchill had at one stage contemplated a union with France, as well as later calling for a United States of Europe, we regarded the setting-up of what was then known as the Common Market \u2013 the European Economic Community \u2013 with a certain disdain. It was a case of \u201cstart the revolution without us\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In our 45 years of membership, we have built up tens of thousands of links that it is absurd to try to remove</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It soon became apparent that the UK had made a mistake. The EEC was doing well, and outpacing the British economy. But we had missed the boat and joined Efta, a rival grouping. There were six members of the original EEC, and seven of Efta; this gave rise to the joke that Europe was \u201cat sixes and sevens\u201d. Efta did not prove good enough, but applications by prime ministers of both major parties \u2013 Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson \u2013 to join the EEC were turned down flat, and we eventually only joined as late as 1973, under Edward Heath.</p> <p>Well, the UK itself is at sixes and sevens at present. Although Efta would be better than nothing, it would be very much a second-best link to the single market, with our having precious little influence over future EU policy.</p> <p>But the Johnson/Gove/Rees-Mogg team would not be content with diminished influence over EU policy. No: they want <em>no</em> influence. They fantasise about being free of the imaginary constraints of the union, and breaking out so that we can increase our exports to China \u2013 notwithstanding the fact that, while allegedly constrained by the EU, German exports to China amount to many multiples of our own.</p> <p>I have little time for Johnson, Gove and the anachronistic Rees-Mogg. As the irrepressible Remainer Lord Adonis keeps pointing out, this trio have in effect been the egregious Nigel Farage\u2019s placemen in cabinet, exerting too much influence on a prime minister who ought to know better.</p> <p>In the 45 years of our membership of the EU, we have built up tens of thousands of links that it is absurd to try to remove. That is why Chancellor Hammond and other Remainers want to stay as close to the EU as possible \u2013 which really means that we should not be leaving at all. But Theresa May is so frightened of Johnson and co that she has still not got the point. She should re-read an infinitely more substantial Boris \u2013 Boris Pasternak \u2013 and his great novel <em>Dr Zhivago</em>: \u201cIt turns out that those who inspired the revolution aren\u2019t at home in anything except change and turmoil\u2026 For them, transitional periods... are an end in themselves... And do you know why there is this incessant whirl of never-ending preparations? It\u2019s because they haven\u2019t any real capacities, they are ungifted.\u201d</p> <p>This country is crying out for leadership, at the outset of potentially its greatest crisis since the second world war. If the Gadarene rush to Brexit is not stopped, the consequences for investment, trade and economic wellbeing are almost certain to be serious.</p> <p>The problem for those of us who have not given up the fight is that, although there are warning signs, the real economic damage from Brexit will only be apparent in the medium term. But even now, notwithstanding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/08/uk-interest-rate-rise-is-coming-bank-of-england-tells-borrowers\">minor upward revisions</a> to the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts, the economy which former chancellor George Osborne believes could become \u201cthe strongest in the world\u201d is falling behind mainland Europe. Moreover, every day brings news of threats to freedoms we take for granted. The price of the \u201cfreedom\u201d the Brexiters want to impose on us would be \u2013 well, less freedom.</p> <p>The new film about Churchill has been a great hit. There is not a Churchill among the Brexiters. It is time for the overwhelming majority of Remainers in parliament to stand up and be counted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>",
