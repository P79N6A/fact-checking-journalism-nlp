Spanish 10-year yields are 1.4% even as the anti-austerity party Podemos, which wants a debt restructuring, makes the running in opinion polls. Capital Economics offers a few reasons why markets might be relaxed before concluding that bond prices are still wrong. First, expectations for Grexit, or Greece\u2019s departure from the euro, are still low. Second, Grexit is deemed less risky than in the past because the European Central Bank has greater crisis-fighting powers than in 2012. Third, even Portugal\u2019s position is not as dire as Greece\u2019s and cheaper oil prices may give everybody a lift. Even so, it all smacks of complacency. The eurozone\u2019s ability to share risks is about to undergo its severest test and the starting positions are miles apart. The only safe bet is that the negotiations will take ages and involve brinkmanship. Then there is the risk that is barely discussed.

Top-line operating profits for 2014 will be \u00a346m, down from \u00a349.6m in 2013, but normal service is maintained on the dividend front.

National Grid is a regulated transmission company and its prices in the UK are agreed on an eight-year cycle. The business is meant to be boring and usually succeeds. Here, for example, is the \u201chighlight\u201d from last July\u2019s quarterly dispatch. Chief executive Steve Holliday concluded: \u201cWe are maintaining our outlook for 2014/15, reflecting the expected delivery of another year of solid operating and financial performance and asset growth, consistent with sustaining our long-term dividend policy.\u201d In other words: nothing interesting has happened since the last time we spoke. From now on, National Grid will issue only half-year and full-year updates as a matter of course. UK financial regulators have permitted such a switch since last November. Very sensible. As National Grid\u2019s finance director Andrew Bonfield says: \u201cMandatory requirements to publish information can frequently provide an unnecessary focus on matters of little relevance to a long-term business.\u201d Those remarks could be echoed by quite a few companies, not all of them regulated utilities. The world would not fall apart if tobacco companies, property developers, even insurers, spoke only twice a year, apart from on occasions when they have specific good or bad news to relate.

Chief executive Steve Holliday concluded: \u201cWe are maintaining our outlook for 2014/15, reflecting the expected delivery of another year of solid operating and financial performance and asset growth, consistent with sustaining our long-term dividend policy.\u201d In other words: nothing interesting has happened since the last time we spoke.</p> <p>From now on, National Grid will issue only half-year and full-year updates as a matter of course. UK financial regulators have permitted such a switch since last November. Very sensible. As National Grid\u2019s finance director Andrew Bonfield says: \u201cMandatory requirements to publish information can frequently provide an unnecessary focus on matters of little relevance to a long-term business.\u201d</p> <p>Those remarks could be echoed by quite a few companies, not all of them regulated utilities. The world would not fall apart if tobacco companies, property developers, even insurers, spoke only twice a year, apart from on occasions when they have specific good or bad news to relate. Quarterly reporting is not the only cause of too many investors\u2019 short-term horizons. But a strike against an overload of unnecessary information is a small advance for common sense.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bank lending to Britain\u2019s factory owners slowed in December according to industry figures on Tuesday that indicate growing unease among manufacturers at the prospects for 2015. The British Banker\u2019s Association (BBA) reported that growth in bank lending to the manufacturing sector more than halved in the last six months and declined by \u00a3624m in December, compared to a \u00a3217m expansion of credit in the previous month. The figures also show that borrowing by companies outside the financial sector contracted by \u00a315.7bn in 2014, compared with a decline of \u00a311.6bn in 2013. The BBA played down the sharp decline, saying the figures can be volatile. It said much of the contraction in lending to non-financial firms was due to a collapse in borrowing by real estate businesses and a switch by large corporations from bank lending to the bond markets as a source of finance. It said that 2014 saw positive borrowing growth in the manufacturing, wholesale and retail sectors. But the recent decline in manufacturing chimes with comments by the British Chambers of Commerce, which has called on the government to boost investment to overcome nervousness in the sector. Richard Woolhouse, the BBA\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cBusiness lending has been falling as larger firms have used the bond market rather than borrowing from banks. He added: \u201cDespite this, outside real estate, businesses are generally expanding their lending.\u201d The BBA figures also cover the number of mortgage approvals made to home buyers, which fell to a 20-month low in December. Some 35,667 home loans with a collective value of \u00a35.8bn were approved last month, marking a 24% decrease compared with December 2013, and the lowest monthly total recorded by the BBA since April 2013. Some 499,000 house-purchase approvals were recorded in 2014, an increase of 9% on 2013, but the total was still 50% below the peak recorded in 2002. Meanwhile, annual growth in non-mortgage borrowing is continuing to run at its highest rate for six years, the BBA reported. Emphasising the UK\u2019s reliance on unsecured debt to fuel spending on the high street, it said the value of credit-card purchases jumped 11% in December compared with the same month in 2013. Woolhouse said many people were starting to feel more secure about their jobs and personal situations, which was helping to encourage more big ticket purchases such as a new car or a home-improvement project.",

    "webTitle": "Alexis Tsipras's new Greek cabinet is sworn in, as bank shares slide - live updates", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a quick summary. Alexis Tsipras has formed his government, and his ministers have been sworn in and are off to work (coverage of the ceremony starts from here). Our leaked list of the cabinet positions is here and official confirmation is here. But even before the swearing in, the new government has opened up a row with Brussels, saying a strongly worded statement on Russia did not have the consent of the new Greek prime minister. Greek banks shares have fallen back on concerns about a lengthly row between the country and its lenders over its financial position. The main Athens market has ended 3.6% lower. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. The Open Europe think tank has taken a look at the new Greek government, and notes that academics have been given several key posts: Some have criticised the choice of academics over those with more practical experience. Given the fairly rapid rise of Syriza, though, we would note that few within its ranks have any practical experience of governing. Also, in politics plenty of senior ministers approach new posts with little first-hand knowledge of their brief. Apart from the obvious disagreements about the bailout, another source of tension between the new Greek government and the rest of the EU could be Russia: Over the past year, Tsipras voiced his support for Russia and his concerns over the European approach to the Ukraine crisis. Two Greek officials told The Wall Street Journal that a strongly-worded statement on Russia issued by EU leaders earlier today did not have the consent of the new Prime Minister. Not a promising start, and tensions may well increase should the moment come to decide on further EU sanctions against Moscow. The government has been formed quickly however, with the two unlikely partners ready to compromise: Coalition negotiations between Syriza and the Independent Greeks have been incredibly quick. According to Kathimerini, the Independent Greeks have agreed to back Syriza\u2019s economic plans. In return, Syriza will hold off on issues that its coalition partner sees as controversial \u2013 such as the separation between the Orthodox Church and the State, and the agreement on a composite name for Macedonia. Even the vote for a new president - which was the trigger for the fall of the Samaras government when it failed to muster enough support for its chosen candidate - could go smoothly: The reported choice of Dimitris Avramopoulos, Greece\u2019s current EU Commissioner, as the new government\u2019s candidate for President is also a sign of wanting things to progress quickly. Being from New Democracy, the party of outgoing Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, he is unlikely to see much resistance from the opposition. Clearly, Tsipras seems willing to sacrifice the (largely ceremonial) post of President to ensure the voting process does not hold up the work of parliament for too long. Unsurprisingly, the new government will prioritise action on the economy. Reports suggest the first measure will be a bill to raise the minimum wage to \u20ac751 per month, followed by another one to facilitate the settlement of tax arrears. The full report is here: Meet the new Greek government I didn\u2019t catch this myself, but blogger Irate Greek reckons Greece\u2019s new finance minister told a reporter outside the presidential parliament that he\u2019ll see Mario Draghi, ECB chief, on Friday. Alexis Tsipras has finally taken control of the official prime ministerial twitter account; he\u2019s properly in charge. His first tweet contains the oath he took yesterday, promising to uphold the Constitution and always serve the interests of the Greek people. Greek bank shares have fallen heavily today, as investors in Athens fear a lengthy clash with the rest of the eurozone over Greece\u2019s debts. Greec\u2019s three largest lenders, National Bank of Greece, Piraeus and Eurobank Ergasias, all tumbled by around 12%. The main ATG index closed 3.7% lower. Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel reports that Alexis Tsipras wasn\u2019t even left the password for the Wi-Fi at the prime ministerial residence. That\u2019s on top of the soap, computers and paperwork vanishing too, according to local media. One staff told the paper: We sit in the dark. We have no internet, no emails, no way to communicate with each other. Just to clarify one point - today\u2019s ceremony included many junior ministers, as well as the cabinet ministers. Surprise! The newly-sworn in cabinet are now heading out of the presidential palace, and off to work. And with that, it\u2019s done: Correction. Reader John Matzavrakos flags up that the religious ceremony was actually conducted by Bishop Methoni, the Assistant Bishop of the Archdiocese of Athens. Not Archbishop Ieronymos of Athens as I wrote. Apologies all. GW Greece\u2019s first blind cabinet minister, Panagiotis Koroumblis, has signed. He\u2019s taking over the health ministry. Yanis Varoufakis is sworn in: Ministers are now taking it in turns to sign the official paperwork. This might take a while.... And now it\u2019s the turn of the other ministers to take a civil oath -- a rather larger group, maybe thirty? (there are 40 ministers in all). The ministers taking the oath are making the sign of the cross. The ministers are placing their hands on the Holy Bible now.... Bishop Klimis of Methoni leading the ceremony, along with two priests, who are intoning the ceremony now. (corrected) Reminder, there\u2019s a live feed here. Greece\u2019s president Papoulias has arrived, and the ceremony is starting now. As explained earlier, the ceremony will be in two parts - a religious oath, and a civil one. After a long wait, the swearing-in is underway. A group of ministers are gathering to take a religious oath: The new Greece government has opened up a row with Brussels about Russian sanctions, even before the cabinet was sworn in. The Wall Street Journal reports: A toughly worded statement on Russia issued Tuesday by European Union heads of governments didn\u2019t have the consent of Greece\u2019s new Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, according to two Greek officials. \u201cThe statement does not have Greece\u2019s consent,\u201d a government official said. The official added that the Greek government will put out a statement later saying the European Council, the body which issued the statement, didn\u2019t follow the correct procedure to win Athens\u2019 consent. A small crowd has gathered outside the presidential palace to welcome the new ministers after they\u2019ve been sworn into office. Presidential palace guards salute as Alexis Tsipras and colleagues enter: There are 39 cabinet members in total, of whom six are women. Vice president Giannis Dragasakis, who will have oversight of economic affairs takes that number up to 40. There are 10 ministries + 3 extra ministers with portfolios such as cracking down on tax evasion (see earlier post for the key roles). Alexis Tsipras just entered the presidential palace for the swearing in ceremony to rapturous applause from onlookers (Helena Smith reports from Athens). The ceremony, for the first time ever will take place in two instalments:for those who want to take the oath of office in a religious ceremony, and those who like Tsipras himself yesterday, prefer a civil service in the presence of the country\u2019s head of state Karolos Papaoulias. Much being made about new economics tsar Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 dress style (photos here). He is wearing a leather jacket for the swearing in ceremony. Mobbed by reporters as he entered the presidential palace by reporters he said: \u201cNegotiations have already begun with our creditors but not with the troika.\u201d The radical left Syriza party has been adamant that it will not have dealings with officials that have represented the country\u2019s triumvirate of lenders at the EU, ECB and IMF but ministers. Greece\u2019s new Health Minister Panagiotis Kouroumblis, who will be among those taking part in the religious service, told reporters: \u201cOur priorities at the health ministry will be about protecting the uninsured. There are 3 million uninsured in our we want to ensure that there is equality of health.\u201d Alexis Tsipras arrives for the swearing in: Journalists swarmed around Greece\u2019s new finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, as he arrived for the swearing in: The swearing-in ceremony is being broadcast live here: Greece\u2019s new cabinet are heading to the presidential palace for the swearing-in ceremony..... Greece\u2019s new State Minister, Nikos Pappas, left the PM\u2019s office clutching a folder after being told he was included in Tsipras\u2019s cabinet. This photoshopped image of the former Greek prime minister leaving office is doing the rounds on social media: As mentioned this morning, Alexis Tsipras arrived at the PM\u2019s residence to find the computers, paperwork and bathroom soap has all been removed, apparently by Antonis Samaras\u2019s staff. The selloff in Athens continues.... Yanis Varoufakis will have the formidable Nantia Valavani and Kostas Mardas as deputy finance ministers. Mardas, an economics professor, will be in charge of taxation policies. Syriza has said, repeatedly, it has \u201cbig fig\u201d tax evaders in its sights. Valavani, a Syriza MP and prolific writer/translator is also a respected economist, Helena Smith reports. The Greek stock market is now down 5%, from 3% earlier. That\u2019s not all Tsipras-related; disappointing corporate results from US construction giant Caterpillar have hit markets around the globe. The New Greek government is official. \u201cThe first cabinet meeting takes place tomorrow,\u201d said Nikos Pappas who announced the government line up (see our leaked list) The new cabinet will be sworn in later today. Tsipras, despite widespread rumour that he would, did not reveal the identities of the new ministers himself but left it to his former chief of staff and newly installed minister of state Nikos Pappas. Skai News warns Greeks to buckle up: \u201cAll the difficulties begin now,\u201d \u201cIn the next two months the state faces 4bn in maturing debt repayments.\u201d (via Helena Smith) Confirmation that Nikos Kotzias, European Studies Professor at University of Piraeus, is the new Greek Foreign Minister. More snaps: HERE COMES THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT. The new Greek cabinet is being announced now. There\u2019s confirmation that Yanis Varoufakis is the finance minister. Professor Giannis Dragasakis is becoming deputy prime minister (as we reported an hour ago). And .....Independent Greek leader Panos Kammenos gets defence. More to follow.... We\u2019re hearing that Elena Koundoura will head the ministry of tourism, meaning there will be two women in the government. A quick update on what has postponed an otherwise speedily created cabinet in Athens this morning. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports that there is an early hiccup in the uneasy power-sharing arrangement behind the \u201cwar cabinet\u201d that will take on the debt-crippled country\u2019s creditors. Turns out that much of the delay is down to discord over whether Nikos Nikolopoulos, the president of the conservative Greek Christian-Democratic party, should be included in the government as Panos Kammenos, who leads the government\u2019s junior partner, had wanted. Syriza had baulked when the request was made. Regular readers will recall that Nikolopoulos was at the centre of an embarrassing twitter war when he greeted the news of the Luxembourg prime minister Xavier Bettel marrying his gay partner thus: \u201cFrom a Europe of nation states to a Europe of ... faggots!! The prime minister of Luxemburg is engaged with his darling!!\u201d Bettel replied calmly to the offensive tweet: \u201cHello, I heard you want to tell me something, but I don\u2019t speak Greek. Sorry\u201d. Nikolopoulos was subsequently bombarded with criticism \u2013 but he taps into the socially conservative views of the Greek public and The Independent Greeks party had lobbied hard to include him. It now appears that Syriza has come out on top and Nikolopoulos will not have a post in the new government. Not long now!...... Greece\u2019s new radical left Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has made good on his promise to pare back government. He has establishment TEN ministries - and four super-ministries [leaked details are here], a feat achieved overnight and one that starkly illuminates the failure of previous Greek governments to act on pledges to reform ministry structure, (writes Helena Smith). Commentators, however, saying that the big question now is whether this new structure will work effectively and bring the collectivity and efficiency that the party has hoped. Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 appointment to the finance ministry (with the British-educated Euclid Tsakalotos as his deputy) is being received positively among Greek watchers. Dr George Kyris, lecturer in politics at Birmingham University has just told Helena that it highlights the party\u2019s shift in policy on issues economic. \u201cWhile often very confrontational, Varoufakis might well provide a very good example of how Syriza has adjusted and has become more moderate, something which, after all, could be seen as a reason for its victory in Last Sunday\u2019s elections.\u201d The blind MP Panagiotis Koroumblis is going to be Greece\u2019s first-ever minister with a disability. He is being appointed to the helm of the health ministry, likely to be one of the government\u2019s most sensitive sectors, Helena Smith points out. Greek bank stocks are hitting fresh lows: Another rumour.... Yannis Panoussis may get Ministry of Protection of the Citizen. And there\u2019s chatter that a second women could be added to the list, as well as Zoe Konstantopolou. Marina Chrysoveloni, spokesman of the populist right wing Independent Greeks party, junior partner in coalition government, has just confirmed that the new cabinet will be sworn in at 5 PM \u201cor just before.\u201d (that\u2019s 3pm GMT) Helena reports: \u201cThe appointment of Panos Kammenos [the party\u2019s leader] to the defence ministry is a fact,\u201d she told Skai news. \u201cWe have our red lines and are bound to them through commitments we have made to the Greek people,\u201d she said mentioning \u201cillegal migrants\u201d (a bogey word to the radical leftists) and debt in the same sentence. \u201cIt is obvious that the debt is not sustainable and there has to be a write-down and that we have to negotiate it with our partners\u201d One last-minute change to that list....Zoe Konstantopoulou is going to assume the presidency of the parliament, so Nikos Voutsis gets the Interior Ministry brief. The new government line-up is expected to be announced imminently. But our correspondent Helena Smith has already heard the details from government insiders. Here\u2019s the list (not official, and subject to last-minute change). Development Ministry (super ministry that will include oversight of shipping and tourism industries) - Economics professor Giorgos Stathakis Finance Ministry: Yanis Varoufakis, Deputy Ministry Euclid Tsakalotos Interior Ministry - Zoi Konstantopoulou Nikos Voutsis . Superministry that will include environment portfolio - Panagiotis Lafazanis (heads Syriza\u2019s euro sceptic Left Platform) ; Deputy minister Yannis Tsironis from Greens party Culture Ministry and education - still undecided if the eminent sociologist Constantine Tsoukalas or Aristidies Baltas will assume the education portfolio and Nikos Xydakis, a former journalist/political commentator will assume the culture portfolio Health Ministry - the blind MP Panoghiotis Kouroumblis Vice President with oversight of economic affairs - Professor Giannis Dragasakis Foreign ministry Professor Nikos Kotzias, deputy foreign minister in charge of European affair, MEP Nikos Hountis Labour Ministry - ex Syriza spokesman Panos Skourletis Justice Ministry with oversight of Panaghiotis Nikoloudis (president of authority in charge of money laundering). And Independent Greeks party leader Panos Kammenos is expected to gets the defense ministry. Helena explains: If that is the case, it would be considered a sop to the nationalist constituency given the populist right win party\u2019s eurosceptic take on foreign affairs. Kammenos, memorably, described Europe as being governed by \u201cGerman neo-Nazis\u201d last week and has made all manner of anti-Semitic remarks. The party\u2019s inclusion in the government is already sending shudders through the Far Left camp of euro MPs which includes Germany\u2019s Die Linke in Brussels. Details of the Greek cabinet are starting to leak out:  Alexis Tsipras\u2019s new Greek cabinet is expected to be announced very soon: Angela Merkel has avoided an awkward conversation with Greece\u2019s new prime minister, by sending him a telegram of congratulation. In it, Germany\u2019s chancellor tells Alexis Tsipras: \u201cYou\u2019re taking over your office in a difficult time in which you face a great responsibility,\u201d \u201cI hope to be able to firm up and deepen with you the traditionally good and deep friendship between our peoples. \u201cI wish you lots of strength and success in your future work as prime minister.\u201d (via Reuters) Readers trying to get their head around why a radical left-wing party like Syriza would team up with a populist right-wing group like Independent Greeks should read this blogpost, by blogger Irate Greek: Strange bedfellows Here\u2019s a flavour: The fact that SYRIZA chose to join forces with Independent Greeks is extremely revealing. A left-wing, democratic party that defends basic liberties and human rights has essentially no other option, in order to govern with an anti-austerity agenda, than to join forces with a racist, ultra-conservative right-wing party whose mentality belongs in the dungeons of history. This is extremely revealing of how screwed up (for lack of a better word) the Greek political scene has become over the past few years, and it is an issue that must be urgently addressed. Syriza\u2019s victory has raised the risks of that Greece will be downgraded, rating agency Moody\u2019s has warned. In a new report, Moody\u2019s said the election outcome Is \u201cCredit Negative Because It Prolongs Financing, Liquidity and Economic Growth Risks\u201d. It warned that: Syriza\u2019s position is in direct opposition to the Troika and will make negotiations for renewing the programme very challenging when the current agreement with the European Commission expires on 28 February. Moody\u2019s estimates that Greece needs to repay \u20ac16bn to repay the IMF, ECB and other official sector creditors. It also has to roll over more than \u20ac10bn of short-term debt (called T-bills). Moody\u2019s concludes: All in all, we expect that the policy uncertainty and the reduced liquidity in the economy will weigh on Greece\u2019s economic growth. Following an expansion of the Greek economy for the first time since 2007 last year (which we estimate at around 0.6%), we currently forecast real growth at slightly above 1% this year. However, we see significant downside risks because we expect investment and consumption levels to remain low and to be further dampened by the political and policy uncertainty associated with this election outcome. Here\u2019s Jon Henley on the news that Yanis Varoufakis is getting the keys to the finance ministry: Varoufakis, 53, studied in Britain and has also taught in Australia, Greece and the US. In pre-election interviews he promised to end what he described as Greece\u2019s humanitarian crisis, slice a chunk off its \u20ac320bn debt mountain, and destroy the country\u2019s oligarchs who \u201cviciously suck the energy and the economic power from everybody else\u201d. A prolific blogger and media commentator who dresses in brightly coloured shirts and jeans, Varoufakis \u2013 who has dual Greek and Australian nationality \u2013 abandoned a job at the University of Texas to join Tsipras\u2019s team in the election runup, and celebrated Sunday\u2019s result by paraphrasing Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, saying: \u201cGreek democracy today chose to stop going gently into the night. Greek democracy resolved to rage against the dying of the light.\u201d New Greek PM Alexis Tsipras appoints radical economist to new government Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who heads up the eurogroup of finance ministers, will meet the new Greek government on Friday, his spokesman says. That could be a lively meeting, given Yanis Varoufakis has condemned austerity as \u2018fiscal waterboarding\u2019. Yanis Varoufakis has pledged to keep blogging his views on the Greek economy once he becomes finance minister (later today). In a new post, called Finance Ministry slows blogging down but ends it not, he says: The time to put up or shut up has, I have been told, arrived. My plan is to defy such advice. To continue blogging here even though it is normally considered irresponsible for a Finance Minister to indulge in such crass forms of communication. Naturally, my blog posts will become more infrequent and shorter. But I do hope they compensate with juicier views, comments and insights. For hope to be revived we must all strive to change the ways of a dismal past. Maintaining an open line with the outside world may be a small step in that direction. So, keep watching this space! The Greek stock market is in retreat today, adding to yesterday\u2019s falls. The main Athens stock market has lost another 3%. Bank shares are leading the fallers: Other European markets are much more muted; Greece is not, yet, causing a panic on the trading floors. Cast your vote, please: Poll: Can Greece\u2019s Alexis Tsipras get a deal with the EU? From Athens, freelance journalist Omaira Gill is tweeting the latest cabinet speculation: Some of these names are new to UK readers (and bloggers!); Greek readers could give us their opinions in the comments below (or by email: graeme.wearden@theguardian.com ) Rumours continue to swirl that Independent Greek leader Panos Kammenos will become Greece\u2019s new defence minister. Some Syriza supporters are appalled by Kammenos\u2019s strident views on immigrations, even before his claim that \u201cJews don\u2019t pay taxes\u201d. That\u2019s why some analysts fear this coalition will be shaky.... Tsipras is expected to announce his cabinet in the early afternoon, once the details have been hammered out. If there are only 10 ministers, as Syriza tweeted earlier, the new PM must be merging several ministries together.... Economics professor Yanis Varoufakis has confirmed to Irish radio station Newstalk that he\u2019ll be appointed finance minister today: It hasn\u2019t been announced yet, but since I\u2019m talking to my Irish friends, I might as well concede that this is happening today. Later on in the afternoon we shall be sworn in. Adding: \u201cAs the next finance minister, I can assure you that I shall not go into the eurogroup seeking a solution that is good for the Greek taxpayer and bad for the Irish, Slovak, German, French and Italian taxpayer.\u201d You can hear an audio clip of the interview here. The selloff in Greek bonds is picking up pace, forcing up the yields (or interest rates) on its three-year and 10-year debt: 08:54 - GREEK THREE-YEAR BOND YIELDS HIT DAY\u2019S HIGH OF 13.81 PERCENT, UP 178 BPS ON DAY - TRADEWEB 08:55 - GREEK 10-YEAR YIELDS HIT DAY\u2019S HIGH OF 9.73 PERCENT, UP AROUND 50 BPS ON DAY - TRADEWEB Investors are getting edgier..... Yanis Varoufakis will be a formidable opponent for those eurozone ministers who insist Greece cannot renegotiate its debt deal, predicts Ambrose Evans-Pritchard of the Daily Telegraph: Economics professor and blogger Yanis Varoufakis has dropped an extremely heavy hint that he is Greece\u2019s new finance minister (as expected) - by republishing a profile from the Telegraph onto his own blog: Varoufakis is quite a character. We reported last night: John Maynard Keynes with a hint of Karl Marx is how one analyst described the self-proclaimed \u201caccidental economist\u201d who is now to become Greece\u2019s finance minister and a key negotiator with its international creditors. He\u2019s certainly experienced - having taught in Australia, Greece and the United States, and he\u2019s shown a very firm grip on the damage that austerity has caused to Greece\u2019s economy, and society. Profile: Greece\u2019s new finance minister Yanis Varoufakis Greek government bonds are falling in value this morning, as the prospect of a battle over debt restructuring looms over the markets. The yield, or interest rate, on Greek 10-year bonds has jumped to 9.6%, from around 9.2% last night. That means the debt is seen as riskier (yields rise when the value of a bond falls) Such yields are also unaffordably high; typically a eurozone country has sought a bailout when yields soared through 7%. David Cameron has offered British assistance to help Greece tighten up its tax collecting operations. Speaking on the Today Programme, the PM said he spoke with Alexis Tsipras last night to congratulate him on his win. And while the pair aren\u2019t ideological soulmates, Cameron did offer to share Britain\u2019s experience on tax transparency, and making the rich pay more, with Athens: That is something we can work with the Greek government on. The International Monetary Fund has repeatedly urged Athens to get to grips with its tax evasion problem.... ...But it\u2019s worth remembering that Britain\u2019s \u2018landmark\u2019 tax deal with Switzerland only yielded a fraction of the revenue predicted at the start. Maybe Tsipras could learn from Britain\u2019s mistakes?.... Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has just told reporters in Brussels that Europe isn\u2019t to blame for Greece\u2019s problems: SCHAEUBLE SAYS GREEK PUBLIC NOT SUFFERING DUE TO BERLIN OR BRUSSELS DECISIONS BUT RATHER DUE TO DECADES OF FAILINGS BY GREEK ELITES My colleague Phoebe Greenwood is in Athens with a film crew. She reports that hopes turned to anxiety yesterday as it emerged Syriza was partnering with the populist Independent Greeks: There\u2019ll only be 10 ministers in Tsipras\u2019s cabinet, Syriza tweets: Prime minister David Cameron has cited Greece\u2019s problems as a reason for UK voters to stick with him at the next British general election, in 100 days time. Interviewed on Sky News this morning, Cameron said that the eurozone\u2019s political landscape is undergoing major change. In Greece, it is reaction to economic failure. The economy is a fifth smaller than before the financial crisis.... The eurozone is a system that is not working properly. Cameron then argued that the \u201cstructural reforms\u201d made in this parliament had helped firms to hire staff and grow; the Bank of England\u2019s active monetary policy was also crucial (something the eurozone is only getting now). He preached a similar message on the BBC\u2019s sofas: Radio 4 listeners won\u2019t be able to avoid it either.... Alexis Tsipras has a nasty surprise when he arrived at the prime minister\u2019s headquarters yesterday, the To Vima newspaper reports. The new government found the Maximos Mansion almost bare, with no sign of computers or paperwork. Even the bathrooms were cleared out. Tsipras told colleagues that: \u201cThey took everything and left. I was looking for an hour to find soap.\u201d Here\u2019s the full sorry tale (in Greek). Alexis Tsipras is expected to start the process of unpicking Greece\u2019s austerity programme quickly, once his cabinet is in place. His first bill is expected to raise the minimum wage back to \u20ac751/month, and to bring back regulations allowing collective wage bargaining. The second draft law will cut the burden of overdue taxes and social security contributions. According to the eKathimerini newspaper: The bill foresees the new payment plans leading to no more than between 20 and 30 percent of taxpayers\u2019 annual income going toward repaying their debts. Tsipras also wants to end the \u201cmobility scheme\u201d that cut jobs across the civil service, which could see some workers rehired. And he\u2019s also planning legislation to give free electricity to 300,000 households living under the poverty threshold. Quite a change from the tax rises and spending cuts driven through by the previous government to meet the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events in Greece. The country\u2019s new government is getting down to business today, as it heads towards a clash with the EU over its debts. Alexis Tsipras, sworn in as prime minister yesterday, is due to name his cabinet today. That should see prominent economist and blogger Yanis Varoufakis formally named as finance minister, with a mandate to push for a debt restructuring deal. The government probably won\u2019t be short of economists. Another, Giorgos Stathakis, is expected to be put in charge of the Development Ministry, according to the eKathimerini newspaper. which adds: SYRIZA\u2019s left wing, or Left Platform, will probably be represented in the government by Panayiotis Lafazanis, Dimitris Stratoulis and Nikos Hountis. Rania Antonopoulou, the director of the Gender Equality and the Economy program at the Levy Institute, is expected to be appointed to the Labor Ministry, possibly as a deputy to Stratoulis. The Independent Greeks party is expected to have one ministerial and up to four deputy ministerial positions in the new government. Party leader Kammenos is likely to be named as the new defense minister. That\u2019s the same Kammenos who was heavily criticised for claiming recently that \u201cJews, Buddhists and Muslims don\u2019t pay taxes\u201d in Greece.... European finance ministers will be watching Athens nervously today, having heard Tsipras declare that \u201cthe end of humiliation has come\u201d. They\u2019re in Brussels this morning for an ECOFIN meeting. Officially, they\u2019ll be discussing Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s plan for a \u20ac315bn fund to pay for new infrastructure projects across Europe, kick-starting its ailing economy. But the Greek election results will surely be discussed too, in the corridors of the power. An ECOFIN press conference is due for 13.30pm Brussels time (12.30pm GMT). We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day again.",

Given the fairly rapid rise of Syriza, though, we would note that few within its ranks have any practical experience of governing. Also, in politics plenty of senior ministers approach new posts with little first-hand knowledge of their brief.</p> </blockquote> <p>Apart from the obvious disagreements about the bailout, another source of tension between the new Greek government and the rest of the EU could be Russia:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Over the past year, Tsipras voiced his support for Russia and his concerns over the European approach to the Ukraine crisis. Two Greek officials told <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-call-for-more-russia-sanctions-didnt-have-greek-consent-1422363607\">The Wall Street Journal</a> that a strongly-worded statement on Russia issued by EU leaders earlier today did not have the consent of the new Prime Minister. Not a promising start, and tensions may well increase should the moment come to decide on further EU sanctions against Moscow.</p> </blockquote> <p>The government has been formed quickly however, with the two unlikely partners ready to compromise: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Coalition negotiations between Syriza and the Independent Greeks have been incredibly quick. According to <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_26/01/2015_546550\">Kathimerini</a>, the Independent Greeks have agreed to back Syriza\u2019s economic plans. In return, Syriza will hold off on issues that its coalition partner sees as controversial \u2013 such as the separation between the Orthodox Church and the State, and the agreement on a composite name for Macedonia.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even the vote for a new president - which was the trigger for the fall of the Samaras government when it failed to muster enough support for its chosen candidate - could go smoothly:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reported choice of Dimitris Avramopoulos, Greece\u2019s current EU Commissioner, as the new government\u2019s candidate for President is also a sign of wanting things to progress quickly. Being from New Democracy, the party of outgoing Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, he is unlikely to see much resistance from the opposition. Clearly, Tsipras seems willing to sacrifice the (largely ceremonial) post of President to ensure the voting process does not hold up the work of parliament for too long. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the new government will prioritise action on the economy.

One such oasis is the Two for the Pot shop in posh Brooklyn Heights. American proprietor John McGill, whose well-heeled British customers have included author Martin Amis, is still digesting the bad news about a Hershey lawsuit designed to ban Cadbury goods imported from the UK.

Ahead of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting - which may well now be less hawkish about interest rate rises than had previously been thought - Microsoft, Pfizer, Procter and Gamble and Caterpillar all fell short of expectations.</p> <p>On top of that orders for durable goods - long lasting products such as equipment, cars and white goods - fell for a fourth straight month.</p> <p>Non-defence capital goods orders - excluding aircraft - fell 0.6% in December, compared to expectations of a 0.5% rise, indicating that slowing global growth and falling oil prices were having an effect on business investment. Total new orders fell 3.4% from a 2.1% decline in November. Chris Low, chief economist at FTN FInancial, told Reuters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A global slowdown, strong dollar and weakness in the oil sector all likely contributed to orders weakness in the second half of last year. The drop in capex will weigh on growth, though stronger consumer spending should keep GDP from slowing too much.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Census Bureau just reported that US durable goods orders unexpectedly dropped 3.4% in December. In addition, the number for the previous month was revised down to -2.1% (was -0.7%). </p> <p>This weak performance in the fourth quarter comes on the back of a very strong rise in capex shipments in the third quarter. So to us, the decline in the fourth quarter does not point to a sharp deceleration in investment activity. It does, however, dash hopes that the strong performance in the third quarter marked the beginning of an accelerated upward trend. And the lackluster performance of capex orders, the leading indicator, at the end of last year does not suggest any significant improvement for the coming quarter, either.

      "bodyText": "Signs of weakness in the US economy have sent markets, already nervous after the Greek election result, tumbling sharply. Investors had been betting that the US was on the growth track, making up for slowdowns elsewhere, particularly in China and the eurozone. But disappointing results from a range of American household names have seen some of that optimism dissipate. Ahead of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting - which may well now be less hawkish about interest rate rises than had previously been thought - Microsoft, Pfizer, Procter and Gamble and Caterpillar all fell short of expectations. On top of that orders for durable goods - long lasting products such as equipment, cars and white goods - fell for a fourth straight month. Non-defence capital goods orders - excluding aircraft - fell 0.6% in December, compared to expectations of a 0.5% rise, indicating that slowing global growth and falling oil prices were having an effect on business investment. Total new orders fell 3.4% from a 2.1% decline in November. Chris Low, chief economist at FTN FInancial, told Reuters: A global slowdown, strong dollar and weakness in the oil sector all likely contributed to orders weakness in the second half of last year. The drop in capex will weigh on growth, though stronger consumer spending should keep GDP from slowing too much. Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said: The Census Bureau just reported that US durable goods orders unexpectedly dropped 3.4% in December. In addition, the number for the previous month was revised down to -2.1% (was -0.7%). This weak performance in the fourth quarter comes on the back of a very strong rise in capex shipments in the third quarter. So to us, the decline in the fourth quarter does not point to a sharp deceleration in investment activity. It does, however, dash hopes that the strong performance in the third quarter marked the beginning of an accelerated upward trend. And the lackluster performance of capex orders, the leading indicator, at the end of last year does not suggest any significant improvement for the coming quarter, either. As a result, and as we have pointed out on several occasions before, the US economy continues to rely primarily on its proven engine of growth: the consumer. So Wall Street, hampered by the predicted blizzard as it has been, is down sharply, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 270 points or 1.5%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is now down 62 points or 0.9%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 139 points or 1.25%. The uncertainty over the future of Greece after the victory by anti-austerity party Syriza is adding to the volatiliy, with the Athens market now down nearly 5%.",

Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s blamed a combination of factors - collapsing oil prices, the rouble\u2019s sharp fall, and sanctions imposed by the west - for the move. The lower the rating, the more expensive it is for a country to borrow, and junk status makes it impossible for some investors to hold the debt at all. Russia is not the only country that doesn\u2019t make investment grade according to the leading agencies. Here we look at some of the other countries that join Russia at the bottom of the heap. Russia is not universally junk - yet The good news for Russia is that the other two main ratings agencies - Moody\u2019s and Fitch - have not given it a junk credit rating. The bad news is that many economic commentators expect them to follow. When it last gave its verdict on 9 January, Fitch did downgrade Russia but left it in investment grade territory, with a \u201cnegative outlook\u201d. Fitch\u2019s next Russia review is scheduled for 17 April. Russia is not alone in its junk status Standard and Poor\u2019s downgrade of Russia left it with a BB+ rating. By S&amp;P definition, that means a sovereign faces \u201cmajor ongoing uncertainties and exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor\u2019s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments\u201d. The move by S&amp;P puts Russia on a direct par with Bulgaria, Indonesia, and Turkey. Greece is ranked lower than Russia With a B rating from S&amp;P, it is worth noting that Greece also has junk status and is even lower down the pecking order than Russia. It means Greece is considered more likely than Russia to default. A poor credit rating is - of course - just one of the many challenges facing the Greek economy and the country\u2019s new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. Argentina is at the bottom of heap Argentina is right at the very bottom of the ratings pile after it defaulted on its debts in 2014 for the second time since 2001. Just ahead of Argentina is Ukraine - whose fortunes are inextricably linked with Russia - where Fitch considers \u201cdefault is a real possibility\u201d. How does the UK fare? When George Osborne took office in 2010, he vowed to safeguard Britain\u2019s treasured AAA rating, arguing he would restore the nation\u2019s economic credibility. The chancellor was left red-faced when Moody\u2019s and Fitch stripped the UK of its top tier status in 2013. But all is not lost, as S&amp;P retained in its AAA view of the UK. And at the very top of the pile... While the three main ratings agencies \u2013 Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s and Fitch \u2013 are divided on the credit worthiness of numerous countries, they are unanimous that the following are AAA rated: Australia Canada Denmark Germany Luxembourg Norway Singapore Sweden Switzerland",

The company has suffered a number of problems, including finding unauthorised payments which led to the dismissal of a number of top executives and suspending operations in Iraq Kurdistan after finding dry wells. It has also been hit by the slump in the crude price, and despite the prospect of a possible bid from Nigeria\u2019s Saplat, it now faces liquidity problems. It has net debt of some $720m including finance leases. The company is in talks with lenders of a $300m debt facility to try and defer a $50m payment due at the end of the month, and is considering whether to use a 30 day grace period with respect to $15m of interest due on its bonds on 1 February. It has also begun discussions with a newly formed committee of bondholders, as well as continuing its talks with Seplat. It said: Assuming the company\u2019s current debt structure remains unchanged, there is an equity funding requirement which is likely to be significant and in excess of the company\u2019s current market capitalisation.

It is somewhat shocking then to hear that the debt needs to be restructured and scheduled payments deferred.
