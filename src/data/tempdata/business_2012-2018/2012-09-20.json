      "bodyText": "Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, has endorsed tearing up the government's debt-reduction goal after he said it was \"acceptable\" to miss the target if the economy continued to grow slowly. In his first live TV interview in nearly 10 years in office, King said the weak state of the economy justified revising the target, which had been drawn up in better times. The governor's support will cheer George Osborne, who has come under pressure to revise his debt-cutting timetable from the left of the Conservative party. The prospect of extra welfare cuts and tax rises to put the government's finances back on track have caused panic in some quarters amid concerns that the next election will be won or lost on the government's economic record. Recent figures for government spending and tax receipts have left the Treasury's calculations in tatters and forced officials to prepare a climbdown ahead of his autumn statement in December. \"We're beginning to see a few signs now of a slow recovery, but it will be a slow recovery. After a banking crisis one can't expect to get back to normal and I fear it will take a long time,\" King told Channel 4 News. Given this situation, it might now be \"acceptable\" for the government to miss a key debt-cutting goal, he added. \"If it's because the world economy has grown slowly and so we, in turn, have grown slowly then it would be acceptable to be in that position, yes. \"The plan did allow for the fact that if the economy were to grow slowly, then taxes would not rise as quickly and spending would be higher \u2014 so the deficit would be bigger,\" he added. King endorsed the coalition government's debt-reduction plans after the last election when the Bank of England and other forecasters believed the UK economy would grow by around 5% by the end of 2012. However, figures for the first two years of the administration show growth soon evaporated and the country entered a second recession in three years. Osborne has consistently blamed the downturn in the eurozone and insisted it was too early in the year to assess whether the government's budget was seriously off track. But a series of worse than expected spending deficits since April have forced a rethink, with some economists calculating the Treasury could be as much as \u00a340bn over budget by the end of the financial year in April 2013. King said the eurozone was important to the health of the UK economy because 50% of exports still crossed the Channel. \"What it will depend on critically, I think, is what happens in the euro area and also the rest of the world,\" he said. King said it was possible that EU politicians would fail to keep the currency club together with disastrous consequences for UK trade and British banks, which have a large exposure to the eurozone through subsidiaries and loans to EU companies. He said: \"[Policymakers] have persisted with trying to keep all the countries in the eurozone ... and tried very hard to keep the show on the road. But I don't think there's any guarantee that they will be able to do that.\" The Bank of England has pumped \u00a3325bn into the economy to boost growth and is midway through a four-month programme that will add a further of \u00a350bn. In the minutes of the last monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting central bank officials considered adding a further injection funds after a string of poor growth figures from the manufacturing and construction sectors. Economists believe it is likely the MPC will approve a further \u00a350bn in November, which would take total asset purchases to \u00a3425bn. King did not directly address November's decision, but insisted the asset purchase programme was still effective and that the Bank was also committed to keeping down inflation, which has been above its 2% target since December 2009. On the Libor interest-rate fixing scandal that brought down the chief executive of Barclays, Bob Diamond, King said he was not responsible for wielding the axe on the high street bank's boss. He said the episode showed the banks in a poor light and reinforced the need for regulations that prevented a repeat of the 2008 banking crash. \"The regulators will issue their reports in due course, and prosecutions may well emerge and I'm sure that large fines on banks will emerge. All this is deeply unsatisfactory,\" he said. King said he had not found his job as stressful as supporting his favourite football team. He told Channel 4: \"Supporting Aston Villa is much more stressful than being the governor of the Bank of England.\" \"On a serious point, it's a demanding job, clearly, and it's all-consuming \u2013 it takes up all my time. But it's not stressful in the sense that I have such good support at the Bank.\"",

The chief executives of 46% of FTSE 100 companies had their basic salary frozen, according to Deloitte Consulting. The widespread pay freeze follows sustained pressure from shareholders and politicians. Last year 21% of FTSE 100 chief executives failed to win a pay rise. However, some industry titans continued to receive rises, which lifted the median FTSE 100 CEO pay by 2.4% to \u00a3856,000. The average amount bosses take home is likely to be some multiple of this figure when bonuses and other incentives are added. A pay survey by corporate governance expert Manifest and pay consultants MM&amp;K recently found average FTSE 100 executive pay rose 12% if the other incentives are included. Bob Diamond, the former chief executive of Barclays, was named as the highest paid boss in 2011 with \u00a320.9m of \"realisable remuneration\" under new methodology designed to replicate rules being introduced by the government that require companies to publish a single overall figure for executive pay. While shareholders have spoken out publicly against excessive pay, only two companies in the FTSE 100 had their remuneration reports voted down this year, while seven remuneration reports have been rejected in total \u2013 the most ever.

Otherwise why would a Japanese person investing in a hedge fund want to pay UK tax? All of the industries I am involved in have to have some offshore entities, if only to help those investors.\"</p> <p>Fink said he tried to persuade George Osborne three and a half years ago that he should change UK tax rules \u2013 under which gains investors make on hedge funds are taxed to income rather than capital \u2013 so the British mainland could compete with offshore jurisdictions.</p> <p>\"I lobbied George Osborne when the Tories were in opposition. I have long felt that the British government loses jobs to tax havens by allowing the revenue to have these rather archaic rules,\" he said. At the time he lobbied Osborne, Fink was not a treasurer but had given more than \u00a31m to the party.</p> <p>As shadow chancellor Osborne resisted his arguments, he said, probably because of influence from Revenue and Customs. \"It's a case where the Revenue has been penny wise and pound foolish.

      "bodyText": "It is not the crystal blue waters of the Caribbean that attract the Conservative party treasurer Lord Fink to the Cayman Islands, the British overseas territory nestled between Jamaica and Cuba. He believes UK investment firms such as ISAM, where he is a director, are drawn to the tiny territory for one overriding reason: the island's authority taxes wealthy foreign investors at much lower rates than in Britain. In a frank interview, Fink has called on the government to compete with the island and other offshore havens by easing the tax burden on wealthy foreigners who invest in hedge funds. \"Offshore companies are used for technical reasons, not tax avoidance [by the company],\" he said. \"Many of the structures in the [hedge fund] business have to be based offshore anyway. Otherwise why would a Japanese person investing in a hedge fund want to pay UK tax? All of the industries I am involved in have to have some offshore entities, if only to help those investors.\" Fink said he tried to persuade George Osborne three and a half years ago that he should change UK tax rules \u2013 under which gains investors make on hedge funds are taxed to income rather than capital \u2013 so the British mainland could compete with offshore jurisdictions. \"I lobbied George Osborne when the Tories were in opposition. I have long felt that the British government loses jobs to tax havens by allowing the revenue to have these rather archaic rules,\" he said. At the time he lobbied Osborne, Fink was not a treasurer but had given more than \u00a31m to the party. As shadow chancellor Osborne resisted his arguments, he said, probably because of influence from Revenue and Customs. \"It's a case where the Revenue has been penny wise and pound foolish. I have never understood it but it is something that the Revenue has always been paranoid about.\" His words may well embarrass the chancellor as he strives to present the Tories as a party that no longer cuts taxes for the rich or is lobbied by its big donors. They come amid an intense national debate over tax and whether there is a moral obligation upon British individuals and businesses not to use offshore havens. Fink \u2013 who has been described as the godfather of the UK hedge fund industry and has now given more than \u00a32.6m to the Tories \u2013 holds directorships at three companies which have links to tax havens. ISAM Services (UK) Limited has a parent company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. A spokesperson for ISAM said this allows a number of international investors to invest in that company without being subject to a double tax charge from the UK and their own domicile. He is also a member of Earth Capital Partners LLP, an investment partnership which owns subsidiary asset management firms in Guernsey. In 2010, Fink was appointed director of Marex Group, which has subsidiaries in Gibraltar and Switzerland. He insists there is little choice for those involved in international investment \u2013 you must have an entity based somewhere such as the Cayman Islands. \"If you want to be a successful business and attract invisible earnings to the UK, you have to be based offshore.\" The widespread connections between peers \u2013 who cannot vote on tax laws but can participate in debate and lobby in Westminster \u2013 and companies established in offshore havens, whether for tax, administrative or operational purposes, seem to confirm Fink's claims that the practice is not seen as tainted by executives in large international corporations. One of the wealthiest people in the music industry, Lord Lloyd-Webber, also sits in the House of Lords as a Conservative peer. He is a director of Really Useful Group, which owns a firm called Ruby Limited, a company registered in the Cayman Islands. A spokesman for Lloyd-Webber said there were no tax benefits from the subsidiary, adding that it is now dormant. He added that Really Useful Group plans to dissolve the company. Lord Howard, the Conservative party leader before Cameron, is a non-executive director of Global Switch Limited, which has offshore subsidiaries in the Isle of Man, Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands. Howard insists the company pays \"all the taxes we are obliged to pay\". \"Global Switch Ltd does not carry out activities in its non-UK subsidiaries and all of the revenues associated with Global Switch Ltd are taxed entirely in accordance with UK legislation.\" Howard added: \"I have no involvement in those [offshore] subsidiaries and as far as I am aware they are all dormant.\" Lord Chadlington, the Tory lobbyist, donor and David Cameron's constituency chairman, is also chief executive of Huntsworth, the public relations group.

Meanwhile, a flash estimate of US industry in the third quarter from Markit showed that output has barely been rising over the summer. The purchasing managers index stood at 51.5 in September, down from 54.2 in June and the weakest since September 2009.</p> <p>\"Manufacturing isn't looking good,\" said David Sloan, economist at 4Cast in New York. \"The global situation is a restraint on the US economy.</p> <p>\"Certainly, there is not going to be much growth in Europe. Growth in Asia, and China in particular, is slowing down, so US growth is going to have to be domestically generated.\"</p> <p>Markit chief economist, Chris Williamson, said: \"With output growing at the slowest pace since the recovery began, the manufacturing sector may have even acted as a slight drag on the economy in the third quarter.\"</p> <p>A separate report from the US labour department showed initial claims for unemployment aid edged down only 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 382,000 last week.</p> <p>Economists had attributed a spike in claims in the prior week to hurricane Isaac, but the minimal improvement in the latest reading pointed to fundamental weakness and will add to the nervousness of Barack Obama's team in the remaining weeks of the US presidential election campaign.</p> <p>With jobs and growth seen as vital by both Democrats and Republicans in the race for the White House, the four-week moving average for new claims rose 2,000 to 377,750 \u2013 the highest level since June and the fifth consecutive weekly increase.</p> <p>Pressure is also mounting on Beijing for a fresh economic stimulus after the broad-based weakening in global demand continued to dampen export demand from China's factories, and left the economy on course in 2012 to post its first sub-8% growth since 1999. Despite an easing of credit conditions and higher spending on infrastructure spending, analysts warned there was little sign of an end to the slowdown in the world's second biggest economy. \"We are now approaching the one-year anniversary of this index dropping below 50 and a recovery is still not in sight,\" said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics.</p> <p>The flash estimate of manufacturing from HSBC/Markit showed the purchasing managers' index at 47.8, little changed from the 47.6 recorded in August and below the cut off point of 50 that separates a contracting from expanding sector.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a European commission report showed eurozone consumer confidence falling for the fourth consecutive month in September to a 40-month low amid signs that activity across the 17-nation single currency zone is heading for a second quarter of decline, meeting the technical definition of recession. Markit's composite PMI for the eurozone dropped from 46.3 to 45.9 in September, its lowest level in three years.</p> <p>Analysts were particularly worried about the big fall recorded in France, seeing it as confirmation that even Europe's biggest economies were not immune from the knock-on effects of the debt crisis. Although Germany put in a stronger than expected performance, financial markets are braced for official growth figures to show that the eurozone contracted by 0.3-0.4% in the third quarter. The EC's consumer confidence index sank to -25.9 in September from -24.6 in August, while Ireland reported that gross domestic product was flat in the second quarter owing to falling consumer spending and much lower investment spending.</p> <p>Martin van Vliet, economist at ING, said: \"Today's PMI figures confirm that the Eurozone economy as a whole remains stuck in recession, despite the tentative signs of stabilisation in Germany. We can only hope that the improved sentiment on financial markets in the wake of the latest actions by the central banks will spill over to the real economy \u2013 not just in Germany \u2013 and help foster a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter. But with the fiscal squeeze across the region intensifying, we cannot rely on it. Indeed, further macroeconomic stimulus \u2013 including a weaker euro and an ECB rate cut \u2013 is likely to be needed to put the region on a path of sustained growth and hence ensure the survival of EMU.\"</p>",

Four years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the biggest slump since the 1930s, a range of gloomy data highlighted the struggle of policymakers to boost activity. Analysts said Europe's sovereign debt crisis, high commodity prices, the legacy of the financial collapse and tension between the world's three biggest economies had soured the economic environment since the start of 2012.

Growth in Asia, and China in particular, is slowing down, so US growth is going to have to be domestically generated.\" Markit chief economist, Chris Williamson, said: \"With output growing at the slowest pace since the recovery began, the manufacturing sector may have even acted as a slight drag on the economy in the third quarter.\" A separate report from the US labour department showed initial claims for unemployment aid edged down only 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 382,000 last week. Economists had attributed a spike in claims in the prior week to hurricane Isaac, but the minimal improvement in the latest reading pointed to fundamental weakness and will add to the nervousness of Barack Obama's team in the remaining weeks of the US presidential election campaign. With jobs and growth seen as vital by both Democrats and Republicans in the race for the White House, the four-week moving average for new claims rose 2,000 to 377,750 \u2013 the highest level since June and the fifth consecutive weekly increase. Pressure is also mounting on Beijing for a fresh economic stimulus after the broad-based weakening in global demand continued to dampen export demand from China's factories, and left the economy on course in 2012 to post its first sub-8% growth since 1999. Despite an easing of credit conditions and higher spending on infrastructure spending, analysts warned there was little sign of an end to the slowdown in the world's second biggest economy. \"We are now approaching the one-year anniversary of this index dropping below 50 and a recovery is still not in sight,\" said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics. The flash estimate of manufacturing from HSBC/Markit showed the purchasing managers' index at 47.8, little changed from the 47.6 recorded in August and below the cut off point of 50 that separates a contracting from expanding sector. Meanwhile, a European commission report showed eurozone consumer confidence falling for the fourth consecutive month in September to a 40-month low amid signs that activity across the 17-nation single currency zone is heading for a second quarter of decline, meeting the technical definition of recession. Markit's composite PMI for the eurozone dropped from 46.3 to 45.9 in September, its lowest level in three years. Analysts were particularly worried about the big fall recorded in France, seeing it as confirmation that even Europe's biggest economies were not immune from the knock-on effects of the debt crisis. Although Germany put in a stronger than expected performance, financial markets are braced for official growth figures to show that the eurozone contracted by 0.3-0.4% in the third quarter. The EC's consumer confidence index sank to -25.9 in September from -24.6 in August, while Ireland reported that gross domestic product was flat in the second quarter owing to falling consumer spending and much lower investment spending. Martin van Vliet, economist at ING, said: \"Today's PMI figures confirm that the Eurozone economy as a whole remains stuck in recession, despite the tentative signs of stabilisation in Germany. We can only hope that the improved sentiment on financial markets in the wake of the latest actions by the central banks will spill over to the real economy \u2013 not just in Germany \u2013 and help foster a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter. But with the fiscal squeeze across the region intensifying, we cannot rely on it. Indeed, further macroeconomic stimulus \u2013 including a weaker euro and an ECB rate cut \u2013 is likely to be needed to put the region on a path of sustained growth and hence ensure the survival of EMU.\"",

The workers in Carletonville are disgruntled with the local leadership of the dominant National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) but their stance has been given fresh impetus by the Lonmin settlement. Zwelizima Vavi, general-secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, raced to the scene on Wednesday with senior NUM leaders, saying they had to prevent \"another Marikana\" after mine management obtained legal grounds to fire the workers. Gold Fields said this week it would not entertain demands for a minimum wage of 12,500 rand despite losing 1,400 ounces a day \u2013 close to 15% of group production. Amid weeks of soul-searching and introspection in South Africa, former NUM leader turned millionaire tycoon Cyril Ramaphosa, a non-executive director of Lonmin, has come to symbolise unease about the gap between a new black elite and the poverty-stricken majority. On Thursday Ramaphosa, a senior figure in the governing African National Congress, apologised for bidding millions of rand on a buffalo cow and her calf. \"Yes, I did put a bid and that was a mistake on my part,\" he told SAfm radio. \"It was a mistake. I regret it. It was a mistake to even put up my hand to do so. \"I've been chastised by some of my good comrades, and even before they chastised me, I did admit that was a mistake. I regret it because it is an excessive price in the sea of poverty. I belong to a community and it was one of those moments when I was blind-sighted.\"",

For policymakers, these echoes of late 2008 are clearly worrying. Back then, the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to a collapse in industrial production and a sharp contraction in world trade. The current slowdown is nowhere near as severe as that suffered in the winter of 2008-09 but is evidence of just how hard it is to shake off the effects of the financial crisis. There are three big and interlocking problems.

The second problem is that little progress has been made in tackling the global imbalances that created the conditions for the crash of 2007.

The chances of this happening, though, are slim \u2013 even assuming it is Obama rather than the more hawkish Romney sitting in the White House next year. The slowing of the global economy is making policymakers more inward-looking and defensive, with just about every country trying to export its way back to prosperity. Beijing's policy easing should be enough to prevent any further weakening in the economy, and there were signs from Thursday's purchasing managers' index that the manufacturing sector is past the worst.

      "bodyText": "Manufacturers expect to boost production over the next three months, raising hopes that the economy is set for an autumn bounce, according to the CBI's survey of the sector. As central banks on both sides of the Atlantic stepped in to prop up demand and calm financial markets, UK manufacturers told the CBI they believed business would improve over the final three months of the year. Almost a third of manufacturers (28%) expected to increase production over the next quarter, while 21% expect output to fall. The positive balance of 7% was an improvement from August, when as many respondents expected output to fall as to rise.

However, she added: \"Uncertainty is expected to build through the autumn \u2013 with key decisions to be made in the eurozone and the approach of the US fiscal cliff \u2013 meaning that conditions are likely to remain difficult for UK manufacturers.\" Manufacturing is key to George Osborne's hopes of rebalancing the economy towards exports and away from consumer spending and financial services.

The British oil group is hoping to sell its 50% stake in TNK-BP in return for cash, but could also accept some shares in Rosneft. BP tied up an earlier share and Arctic exploration agreement with Rosneft only to see it thwarted by its TNK partners, oligarchs from AAR. But a revived plan is now under discussion as BP tries to raise $25bn (\u00a315bn), some of which will be used to pay off claims from the Gulf of Mexico spill. Bob Dudley, the BP chief executive, and his chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, met Vladimir Putin and Rosneft president, Igor Sechin, at Sochi on the Black Sea earlier this week. \"The meeting discussed the continuation and broadening of BP's presence on the Russian market as well as prospects for co-operation with Russian companies,\" said a Kremlin statement. BP said it had been a positive exchange with Putin which was designed to \"update the president on the progress of the sale and to reaffirm our commitments to Russia\". Rosneft is already understood to be talking to Barclays and other banks in London about raising up to $15bn of new funding to finance a transaction. An additional $5bn is said to be expected from Russian lenders. AAR has also said it would intend to submit a bid but only for half of the BP stake. A 90-day consultation period between BP and AAR ends on 17 October. But a bid from Rosneft could come earlier than this, industry sources say.

      "bodyText": "The Olympics discouraged shoppers from buying online in August as they switched to the high street, the Office for National Statistics has said. But the revived enthusiasm for the shops failed to lift sales volumes, which fell 0.2% on July. The high street benefited from a surge in the sale of sporting goods and toys, much of it related to the Mo Farah effect and the success of Team GB, combined with shirt sales ahead of the football season. The ONS said a 2.7% rise in overall sales since August 2011 had failed to significantly alter the picture for a sector that has flatlined over the last couple of years. Nevertheless, retail sales were still up 0.6% in the three months to August compared to the three months to May, which reinforces the view of many economists that the much-anticipated figures for third quarter GDP will show a rise after three quarters of falls. David Tinsley, UK economist at the investment bank BNP Paribas, said the decline in retail sales was disappointing, but \"with the Olympics distracting shoppers over that month, the fall could, on balance, have been much worse\". Excluding fuel, sales fell 0.3% on the previous month, the ONS said. Food sales saw an increase, along with clothing and footwear, which saw sales rise 1.6%. But this was offset by a 2.7% fall in household goods sales and a 6.7% drop in internet purchases. The fall in household goods was accompanied by a 4% fall in mortgage approvals, the Council for Mortgage Lenders said in a separate survey. The sale of household goods is closely linked to the housing market, which has been depressed for the last four years with transactions running at half the levels they were before the crisis. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, was gloomy about the outlook for the consumer over the coming months. \"Hopes that the squeeze on consumers' purchasing power would ease markedly further over the latter months of 2012 are waning.

      "bodyText": "Cigars were no doubt being lit in the boardroom of Imperial Tobacco this morning as a solid, if somewhat brief, trading statement allayed fears that the Davidoff cigarette maker might be suffering. Its shares have dropped nearly 7% in the last two months. Sales were in line with the company's expectations with revenues expected to be up 4% thanks to strong sales in Eastern Europe, Africa, Middle East and Asia-Pacific. But weakness in Ukraine and Poland \u2013 along with trade sanctions against Syria \u2013 will see volumes fall 3%. However, there was no mention of the display bans in the UK and proposed plain packaging, which the cigarette lobby have been shouting about for months. Shares were up 24p to \u00a323.60 and received lukewarm praise from analysts. Investec wrote: We read Imperial's (customarily brief) Q4 update as a solid result in a climate of low expectations in the market. While Panmure Gordon said: Imperial's in line FY 2012 trading statement should come as a relief, given the degree of nervousness ahead of the statement. Revenue growth of c.4% for FY 2012 represents a decent acceleration from c.3% in the first nine months. Although the stick equivalent volume decline of 3% is slightly disappointing and indicates no improvement on the first nine month's performance.
