      "bodyText": "Government advisers have told ministers to back only a single new nuclear power station after Hinkley Point C in the next few years, because renewable energy sources could prove a safer investment. The National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) said the government should cool down plans for a nuclear new build programme that envisage as many as six plants being built. The commission, launched by George Osborne in 2015, said that a decade ago it would have been unthinkable that renewables could be affordable and play a major role in electricity generation. But the sector had undergone a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d as costs fell, it said. Sir John Armitt, the NIC\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cThey [the government] say full speed. We\u2019re suggesting it\u2019s not necessary to rush ahead with nuclear. Because during the next 10 years we should get a lot more certainty about just how far we can rely on renewables.\u201d He argued that wind and solar could deliver the same generating capacity as nuclear for the same price, and would be a better choice because there was less risk. \u201cOne thing we\u2019ve all learnt is these big nuclear programmes can be pretty challenging, quite risky \u2013 they will be to some degree on the government\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s pretending you can take forward a new nuclear power station without some form of government underwriting or support. Whereas the amount required to subsidise renewables is continually coming down.\u201d Renewables were a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to make the UK greener and make energy affordable, he added. Armitt said he was agnostic about whether the next power station was the one Hitachi wanted to build in Wales, or one EDF Energy hoped to build in Suffolk. The government is in the process of negotiating a deal with Hitachi to enable the project at Wylfa on Anglesey to go ahead. But the NIC\u2019s report was unequivocal. It said: \u201cGovernment should not agree support for more than one nuclear power station beyond Hinkley Point C before 2025.\u201d Armitt said: \u201cBy that point we should be in better position on storage technology and presumably [will] continue to see a drop in price on renewables.\u201d The NIC said that by 2030 a minimum of 50% of power should come from renewables, up from about 30% today. New figures released by energy analytics firm EnAppSys show renewables have already overtaken nuclear for electricity generation. Wind, solar and biomass power stations supplied 28.1% of power across April, May and June, with nuclear at 22.5%, the third quarter in a row that renewables have outstripped nuclear. The government has repeatedly stressed its backing for new nuclear plants, recently striking a sector deal with the nuclear industry. A government spokesperson said: \u201cAs we continue our transition to a low-carbon economy and meet this challenge the government is committed to providing a secure energy system with a diverse energy mix in which new nuclear has an important role to play.\u201d But Armitt said he was hopeful that, as an independent adviser to ministers, his recommendations would fall on receptive ears. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen how long it took to negotiate Hinkley \u2013 does the government really want to have to keep going through those sort of negotiations?\u201d he said. Separate research commissioned by the NIC and published on Tuesday found that nuclear and renewables could meet climate targets for comparable costs. Aurora Energy Research concluded that, regardless of which technology was pursued, the power sector would have to reach zero emissions by 2050 to hit legally binding carbon goals. In a statement, EDF Energy said it believed \u201cin having as much renewable power as practically possible and is making major investments in renewables. However, having too much of one energy type creates risks to security of supply and increases costs.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a report that must not be lost in the noise of Brexit. The National Infrastructure Assessment is a once-a-parliament affair from a body that was created to save us from the deadly combination of politicians\u2019 machismo and the electoral cycle. More prosaically, the National Infrastructure Commission\u2019s job is to inject long-term strategic thinking into the critical business of building important stuff. Its first report contains a devastating conclusion: the government should drop its obsession with building more and more nuclear power stations. The NIC still imagines one more nuclear plant, on top of Hinkley Point C in Somerset, before 2025, but the contrast with the government\u2019s current approach is stark. Energy ministers for a decade have told us that a \u201cresurgence\u201d in new nuclear in the UK is the only way to keep the lights on while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions. As for the hideous costs of Hinkley on our energy bills for 35 years, we were told they must be swallowed to get the nuclear show up and running again. Another six plants could be needed, it has been claimed. Sir John Armitt, the NIC\u2019s chairman, has cut through this cultish logic with admirable ease. There is no need to rush with nuclear because \u201cduring the next 10 years we should get a lot more certainty about just how far we can rely on renewables,\u201d he says. Well, quite. The major development in the energy market in the past decade has been the plunging price of renewables. Costs have been cut faster and further than assumed in Whitehall. In last autumn\u2019s capacity auction, the \u201cstrike prices\u201d for two big offshore windfarms came in at \u00a357.50 per megawatt hour and a third at \u00a374.75. These figures \u2013 the guaranteed price for the electricity generated \u2013 compare to Hinkley\u2019s \u00a392.50. The next generation of nuclear plants really will be cheaper, the industry likes to claim, yet its boasts tend to rely on the assumption that a bigger slice of the construction risks can be shoved on to the government\u2019s balance sheet. Even if such \u201cclever\u201d financing models were deemed desirable, however, they don\u2019t change the basic facts. From a purely financial perspective, offshore wind and solar are the cheapest bets. Some \u201cbaseload\u201d nuclear may still be required for security of supply but the NIC\u2019s conclusion merely sounds like common sense: the UK shouldn\u2019t rush to tie itself to an expensive nuclear future; it should back renewables to continue becoming cheaper; and it should see what developments arrive from the world of storage technology, which could change the game again. The government, when it gets back to governing, needs to respond. Its mania for new nuclear plants has looked out-of-date, wrong-headed and unnecessarily expensive for ages. Now even its own infrastructure adviser agrees. A U-turn is required. Can Mothercare win back consumers? A decade ago Mothercare had 425 stores in the UK. By 2014 the figure was 220. Today it is 140 and, on the latest restructuring plan, the group will be down to its last 77 within a year, at which point it will supposedly emerge as a lean and restructured business that is \u201cfit for purpose\u201d, as the interim chairman, Clive Whiley, puts it. His predecessor, Alan Parker, promised the same \u201csustainable\u201d outcome many times over the years, so shareholders should approach with extreme caution. On the plus side, the latest rejig was accompanied by hard talk about \u00a319m of cost savings from rent reductions, store costs and central overheads as the CVA process is completed. Those savings will plainly help. The missing ingredient, however, is firm evidence that Mothercare can back win consumers in the age of Amazon and stronger competition from supermarkets. The chief executive Mark Newton-Jones\u2019s sermon about \u201cexciting\u201d plans to \u201crevitalise the brand\u201d has also been heard many times. The share price has sunk so low there\u2019s no point in shareholders throwing a tantrum. The \u00a332.5m fundraising, which will double the number of shares in issue, is underwritten, so the company will get its cash whatever happens. But a point to remember is that the company last paid a dividend in 2012. Greater retailing recoveries have happened \u2013 but Mothercare\u2019s decline is not new. A flicker of fear over Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans The FTSE 100 index rose 1% on Monday, seemingly ignoring the excitement in Westminster. Look beneath the surface, however, and four of the few fallers were companies in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s sights. The water companies Severn Trent and United Utilities were down 3% and 2% respectively. National Grid and Royal Mail also shed a little value. One couldn\u2019t call it a shudder of fear among investors over Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans \u2013 but it was a flicker of worry.",

It found that such highly flexible systems with little centralised bargaining across sectors and industries delivers lower employment, higher unemployment, and greater wage inequality. At the moment such is the desire to find wage growth improving that almost any signs will be taken as evidence of good news ahead. One of these signs is that the latest annual wage increase for enterprise bargaining agreements made in the March quarter this year was 2.7% \u2013 up from 2.5% in December last year and the record low of 2.2% in September. It all seems rather promising and even had the Financial Review suggesting \u201cWage growth climbing across the industries\u201d. Unfortunately while it is certainly nice that we are no longer setting record lows, it remains more in the \u201cless bad\u201d category than \u201cgood news\u201d. When we look at the chart of annual wage growth of EBA\u2019s it\u2019s clear that even though the 2.7% growth of agreements in March is an improvement it remains below the 2.8% average for all current EBA\u2019s, meaning the overall average is likely to keep falling: The other problem is that fewer people are being covered by EBAs \u2013 even compared with last year. The lowly 2.2% average annual wage growth for those EBA\u2019s approved last September covered 236,200 workers compared to just 126,500 who are part of the EBAs that are getting the average of 2.7%. This factor is one that fits with the finding in the latest OECD report on employment released last week that highlighted a major cause of the persistent low wage growth both here and in the rest of the OECD is the falling levels of collective bargaining. In March just 1.78 million employees were covered by an EBA \u2013 the lowest level as a percentage of all employees since the mid 1990s: This means that while union-negotiated EBAs generally produce higher annual wage growth than the average wage price index (2.8% compared with 2.1%), the impact of those higher wage rises is lessening across the labour market. The good news for Australia is that the OECD found generally we were doing well compared to other nations. Our levels of employment, unemployment were better than the OECD average, but out level of underutilisation \u2013 which takes into account underemployed workers was slightly worse than the average: Similarly our average earnings, job insecurity and the quality of our working environment were all above average: A major reason for this is that we were less affected by the GFC than most other nations in the OECD. The report notes that during the period of the GFC real wages in Australia actually \u201cgrew even while they shrank in most other countries\u201d. But that relatively better performance has largely dissipated, and now our wage growth \u201cremains lower than it was before the crisis for comparable levels of unemployment\u201d. This is the nexus of unemployment and wage growth known as the Phillips curve and the OECD has noted that across all advanced economies there has been a \u201cdownward shift\u201d in the curve. If we look at Australia from 1998 to 2012 (which was the point at which our wages growth began to slide in much the same way as the rest of the OECD), if we had an unemployment rate of 5%, then wages would likely be growing at around 3.7%; if unemployment rose to 7%, then wages growth would slow to around 3.1%. It wasn\u2019t a perfect linear trend but it held up pretty well. What a downward shift means is that for each rate of unemployment the expected wage growth would be lower. We have seen signs of that since mid 2016. Then trend of the past two years is such that an unemployment rate of 5% would now only be expected to deliver wage growth of around 2.5%: Even worse, the OECD notes for Australia that \u201cthe current, unprecedented period of slow wage growth has particularly affected vulnerable individuals, who are also more prone to experience spells of unemployment or precarious jobs\u201d. It also notes that there has been a \u201ca significant worsening in the average earnings from part-time jobs relative to that of full-time jobs, which is associated with the rise of involuntary part-time employment\u201d. But where the OECD\u2019s report really hit home is when it looks at the role of collective bargaining. It notes that more decentralised (or firm-level, flexible) bargaining systems are linked with greater levels of productivity, but also crucially \u201cpoorer labour market outcomes.\u201d The trick is to find the sweet spot, and the OECD\u2019s report suggests that \u201clargely decentralised bargaining systems\u201d such as in Australia \u2013 where there is barely any cross sector links other than a minimum wage and certainly no bargaining across sectors or industries \u2013 have gone too far down the \u201cflexibility\u201d path. The report notes that \u201csystems that co-ordinate wages across sectors tend to be linked with lower wage inequality and better employment outcomes, including for vulnerable groups\u201d. Such a centralised system, which allows for cross-industry bargaining \u201cincreases solidarity between workers in different sectors and helps ensure that collective bargaining improves employment by taking due account of macroeconomic conditions\u201d. It notes that the \u201corganised decentralisation\u201d system \u2013 such as occurs in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden \u2013 \u201ctends to deliver good employment performance, better productivity outcomes and higher wages for covered workers\u201d. Damningly however, it found that the more decentralised systems like Australia\u2019s \u201ctend to be associated with somewhat poorer labour market outcomes\u201d \u2013 for example having higher rates of unemployment\u2019s for \u201cyouth, women and low-skilled workers\u201d and also a higher \u201cshare of involuntary part-time workers\u201d. The good news is Australia\u2019s outcome have not been as bad as those in fully decentralised systems, but it serves as a warning to those believing the answer is yet more flexibility. Yes, greater flexibility may bring more productivity, but the OECD\u2019s research shows it comes at the cost of lower employment from many groups, higher overall unemployment, greater underemployment and definitely not better wage growth. In effect such a move would deliver exactly the opposite of what we need right now. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

More Thameslink services were to be added to the timetable in December, but GTR \u2013 Britain\u2019s biggest commuter franchise \u2013 has yet to deliver anything like the promised May schedule due to a shortage of trained drivers on routes in and out of London.

      "bodyText": "Petrol and diesel hybrid cars will still be permitted to be sold in 2040, the government has conceded, in a move that has angered environmental campaigners but was welcomed by the car industry. Ministers last year pledged to ban new cars powered by fossil fuels by 2040 but the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, confirmed on Monday that hybrid cars \u2013 powered by electricity and diesel or petrol \u2013 would be exempt. The government\u2019s Road to Zero strategy to reduce car pollution now includes a further target for at least 50% of new cars to be ultra-low emission by 2030. However, it stops short of outright commitments for the decades ahead, saying it expects \u201call new cars and vans to have significant zero-emission capability\u201d by 2040 and \u201calmost every\u201d car and van to be zero-emission by 2050. Grayling said he believed the best method was to influence car buyers: \u201cI want it to be easier for electric vehicle drivers to recharge than for motorists to visit a filling station. I want them to choose electric cars because they are so convenient.\u201d He said a delayed \u00a3400m charging fund would be launched this summer to help expand infrastructure across the country, with hundreds of thousands more charging points on streets, in new homes and in workplaces. He said that as well as reducing pollution, the strategy set out a clear path for Britain to be a world leader in zero-emission transport, which represented \u201ca huge global opportunity for industry and business\u201d worth \u00a31tn a year by 2030. However, environmental groups accused the government of weakening its commitments. Greenpeace said the car industry was \u201cyet again being given a free pass\u201d and the targets were weak by international standards. The Campaign for Better Transport said it was disappointing, describing it as \u201ca step backwards, giving concessions to keeping hybrids on the road, which will water down the already inadequate 2040 target\u201d. But Grayling told the Guardian: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s watered down at all \u2026 We want to get rid of classic petrol and diesel engines. It\u2019s about supporting the industry to deliver it and encouraging changes to consumer behaviour. I expect by 2040 every vehicle to have substantial zero-emission capability and most to be 100% zero-emission.\u201d The motor industry had argued that the 2040 targets were contributing to consumer fears over diesel cars, whose UK sales have slumped in the last 15 months. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the strategy recognised \u201cthe vital role conventional engines, including diesel, will continue to play in the transition to 2040 and beyond\u201d. He said the industry welcomed the \u201ctechnology neutral approach\u201d and the news that hybrids would not be banned but remained concerned over 2030 targets for ultra-low emission vehicles. \u201cWe need realistic ambition levels and measures that support industry\u2019s efforts, allow manufacturers time to invest, innovate and sell competitively, and provide the right incentives and infrastructure to take the consumer with us,\u201d he said.",

How could this be more depressing? What if I told you that this initiative was spearheaded by JD Wetherspoon? Wow, you did it. Don\u2019t forget that the Wetherspoon chairman, Tim Martin, was a leading voice of Brexit in the run-up to the referendum. Remember that time he had loads of pro-Brexit beermats printed up for his pubs? Remember how we all thought that was the desperate act of a desperate man? How we laughed. But he is our king now, and we must obey his commands. So what are we gaining from this? The Wetherspoon website lists beverages, such as Denbies Whitedowns sparkling brut, Whitedowns rose brut and Thornbridge Versa Weisse beer as new British alternatives. Good. \u201cBrut\u201d and \u201cweisse\u201d are strong British words that only help to reinforce our sense of sovereignty. Don\u2019t be sarcastic. Is this because Martin hates Europe?

      "bodyText": "With this, we are closing the blog for the day. Thank you for all your great comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Following an initial dip, the pound has rallied since news broke of the resignation of Brexit secretary David Davis late on Sunday night. He has been replaced by former housing minister Dominic Raab, a Brexit-supporting minister. Sterling is currently up nearly 0.5% at $1.3349, and steady against the euro. Investors are betting that Davis\u2019 departure won\u2019t endanger the prime minister, and that a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit has become more likely since Friday\u2019s Chequers summit. Stock markets have begun the week on a positive note, despite rising trade tensions between America and China, which both imposed tariffs on a number of imported goods on Friday. Analysts say that markets brushed aside concerns over the impact on the world economy (as they have known for a month that the tariffs were coming), and were cheered by Friday\u2019s healthy US jobs figures. Oil prices are climbing on higher global demand and US efforts to block Iranian supplies using sanctions. Brent crude is up 0.8% at $77.71 a barrel while US crude is little changed at $73.82 a barrel. It is the third day of gains on US stock markets. Wall Street has opened higher, as expected. Dow Jones up 0.4% S&amp;P 500 up 0.4% Nasdaq up 0.55% This means Draghi could leave office in November 2019 without ever having hiked interest rates during his eight-year term. Interest rates in the eurozone will stay on hold for at least another year, as previously signalled. Draghi said: We expect key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with our current expectations of a sustained adjustment path. Draghi also reiterated that the ECB would pare back its monthly asset purchases from \u20ac30bn to \u20ac15bn and end the programme at the end of December. \u201cThis is subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook.\u201d In his speech to the European parliament, ECB chief Mario Draghi has warned that the main risks to economic growth come from trade disputes. As I have said before, downside risks to the outlook mainly relate to the threat of increased protectionism. A strong and united European Union can help reap the benefits of economic openness while protecting its citizens against unchecked globalisation. In leading by example, the EU can lend support to multilateralism and global trade, which have been cornerstones of growing economic prosperity over the past seven decades. But to be successful on the outside, the EU requires strong institutions and sound economic governance at home. You can read the whole speech here. Wall Street is expected to open higher, with investors still cheered by healthy US jobs data published last Friday, which have outweighed concerns over rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Stock market futures are pointing to rises of 0.4% to 0.5% for the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones. While we are waiting for ECB chief Mario Draghi\u2019s speech at the European parliament in Brussels (2pm BST), the central bank\u2019s governing council member Ewald Nowotny has warned that trade wars, Brexit and capacity constraints are the main risks for the eurozone economy. He told a financial seminar in Zurich: For the eurozone, the Brexit constellation is something we look at. It is mainly a risk for the UK, but it also may pose risks and uncertainties for the eurozone.\u201d Michael Minall, automotive sector specialist at management consultancy Vendigital said that following steady sales declines over the past few years, this admission from Nissan could well mean the death of diesel. In 2015, VW\u2019s emissions-rigging highlighted the disparity between real-world performance of diesel engine cars and laboratory test results. These latest revelations have once again pushed the issue into the spotlight, at a time when many consumers have also lost confidence in diesel. While the findings of Nissan\u2019s investigation and the immediate impact of the news on automotive suppliers is unlikely to be significant, it certainly represents another nail in the coffin for the diesel car market. In other news, Nissan has admitted that exhaust emissions and fuel economy tests for 19 models in Japan were falsified. Reuters reports: The Japanese carmaker said on Monday it had discovered the testing environments for emissions and fuel economy in final vehicle inspections at most of its factories in Japan were not in line with requirements, and inspection reports were based on altered measurements. \u201cA full and comprehensive investigation of the facts \u2026 including the causes and background of the misconduct, is under way,\u201d Nissan said. The problems were found during voluntary compliance checks following an improper vehicle inspection scandal last year. In October, a recall of 1.2m vehicles was triggered after Nissan said uncertified inspectors had signed off on final checks for cars sold in Japan. The carmaker blamed staffing shortages for the scandal, which caused annual operating profit to slide. Nissan said the latest misconduct did not compromise the safety of the affected models, and mileage readings were in line with levels presented in product catalogues. It was in the process of compiling data for the GT-R sports car to confirm it satisfied safety standards. Returning to trade... China says it will use the funds collected from tariffs charged on imports from the US to help ease the impact of US tariffs on Chinese companies. The commerce ministry also said it will encourage companies to import more products such as soybeans and cars from other markets. Amin Nasser, the chief executive of Saudi Arabia\u2019s state energy giant Saudi Aramco, has warned of an oil supply crunch as investment in shale projects won\u2019t be enough to meet rising demand. He told the Financial Times in an interview (paid content): Something like shale oil\u2026 it is not going to really create a major dent in total global supply requirements up until 2040. Energy companies are reluctant to invest in longer-term projects that are more costly, and are instead cutting costs and returning money to investors through dividends and share buybacks. Meanwhile, the Church of England has threatened to sell its shares in oil and gas firms that fail to do enough to combat climate change. Elsewhere, oil prices are climbing on increased global demand and US use of sanctions against Iran to shut out Iranian output. Brent crude, the world benchmark, is 0.8% higher at $77.74 a barrel. The US wants to reduce oil exports from the world\u2019s fifth-bigger producer of oil to zero by November, which would put pressure on other big producers such as Saudi Arabia to pump more crude. However, Saudi Arabia and other members of the Opec oil cartel have little spare capacity and oil demand has outpaced supply in recent months. US oil output is increasing but is not enough to plug the gap if Iranian exports are blocked. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has also explained the buoyancy of sterling following David Davis\u2019 departure. Sterling continued to benefit from the resignation of Brexit Secretary David Davis, with his claim that he won\u2019t challenge Theresa May\u2019s Tory leadership, alongside the swift appointment of Dominic Raab as his replacement, extending the pound\u2019s Monday gains. Hopes that Davis\u2019 grumpy abandonment of his passion project will lead Britain away from the harder EU exit Double D was after, and towards the \u2018softer\u2019 Brexit proposed by Theresa May at Chequers over the weekend has allowed the pound to ride-out Monday\u2019s bumpy ministerial transition. Against the dollar it shot up half a percent, hitting a 3 and a half week high of $1.333, while against the euro it climbed 0.3% to sit a smidge off \u20ac1.133. Despite all this the FTSE still managed to find its own groove on Monday, the UK index rising 0.5% to tickle 7650. That\u2019s very much in line with the situation elsewhere, with the DAX up 0.2% and the CAC jumping 0.6%. The gains come as investors express their relief at the lack of trade war escalation between the US and China (or indeed the US and EU) over the weekend, something that had become the norm in the last few weeks. Turning to this afternoon and the Dow Jones it looking at its own half a percent rise when the bell rings on Wall Street, a move that would leave the US index just short of 24600, its best price in a fortnight. There\u2019s not too much US-specific stuff to deal with this Monday, so, Trump-intervention aside, should be able to keep hold of that growth. The pound is remarkably resilient this morning following David Davis\u2019 resignation as Brexit secretary. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING, says: We\u2019ve been saying that what matters for sterling markets is the type of Brexit delivered - not who delivers. The pound is able to live with ministerial resignations as long as that is the extent of the fallout. Looking at the tail risks of a Tory leadership contest - or even a General Election - we note the legislative hurdle is pretty high to see either outcome. So at this stage, one is inclined to interpret Davis\u2019 resignation as a sign that the UK government is steering towards a softer Brexit - which is the more powerful, positive sterling driver. UK bond yields are also rising as investors are betting on a greater chance of Britain reaching a Brexit deal with the EU, following the resignation of Brexit minister David Davis. Dominic Raab, the housing minister, has been announced as his replacement in the last few minutes. Davis said this morning that he was not calling on other ministers to quit and expressed belief that Theresa May could survive the upheaval. The yield on two-year gilts hit its highest level since 24 May. Some more thoughts on sterling, which is up around 0.4% at $1.3340. Chris Scicluna at Daiwa Capital Markets said: Sterling remains broadly stable this morning, and firmer than it was ahead of the Cabinet agreement last Friday. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at online trading firm IG, said: Brexit concerns are back at the top of the agenda, following last week\u2019s meeting at Chequers, culminating in yesterday\u2019s resignation from David Davis. While markets should be worried by the added uncertainty of losing the Brexit secretary just eight months before the UK leaves the EU, there is a feeling that the UK is moving towards a business-friendly softer Brexit. The BCC has voiced its concerns over the impact of a potential rate rise, with companies clearly in limbo ahead of an uncertain Brexit. However, while companies and individuals may not too keen on a BoE rate rise, markets are clearly warming to the idea, with GBPUSD rising to a three-week high, amid a wider dollar selloff. Markets are currently pricing in an 80% chance of a BoE rate rise in less than a months\u2019 time, yet with the UK GDP figure due out tomorrow morning, we could see some sterling volatility to come this week. Interestingly, tomorrow\u2019s UK GDP reading represents the start of a new period where we will see monthly releases from the ONS, allowing the BoE to enjoy a more accurate economic environment for setting rates. Contrary to earlier reports, junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman has not resigned, Reuters is reporting, citing a UK government official. There isn\u2019t much corporate news here in the UK this morning. As we reported earlier, Mothercare is slashing more jobs than expected and unveiled details of its planned fundraising later this month. The German publisher Axel Springer has raised its stake in the UK online estate agent Purplebricks to 12.5% from 11.5% and did not rule out a further increase. Purplebricks ventured into the US last year, its third market after Britain and Australia, but remains deep in the red with its operating loss quadrupling last year. Despite warnings that the tariffs imposed by Washington and Beijing on Friday in a tit-for-tat trade dispute could hit economic growth around the world, markets are sanguine \u2013 for now. Analysts at London Capital Group said: The actual trade tariffs are nothing new, the market has been aware of them for over a month, and for now conditions are still supportive for financial growth, allowing markets to move higher. Sentiment could remain resilient until we see solid evidence of these trade tensions feed through to softer economic data, particularly in China. Global stocks have hit a two-week high following the stronger-than-expected US jobs report on Friday, and as traders shrugged off rising trade tensions between America and China. Sterling recovered quickly after a dip following Brexit secretary David Davis\u2019 resignation as traders focused on the likelihood of a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d. Davis made clear this morning that he would not stand against Theresa May and would not encourage others to challenge her. The pound is now up 0.5% against the dollar. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, has risen 0.8% while the pan-European Stoxx 600 is 0.6% ahead. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 0.15% at 7629.13 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.2% at 12,524.87 France\u2019s CAC up 0.6% at 5480.75 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.4% at 9947.70 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.66% at 22,0780.09 Sterling is now up more than 0.5% to $1.3358, after former Brexit secretary David Davis said he was not planning to challenge Theresa May\u2019s leadership, and that he wanted her to stay as prime minister. \u201cI like [May]. She is a good prime minister,\u201d he told the Radio 4 Today programme. I\u2019m told that the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor Ben Broadbent is speaking at an internal event this morning. The Bank\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane is speaking at townhall meetings in the North East. Again there is no text. UK regulators have blocked the sale of aircraft parts firm Northern Aerospace to a Chinese buyer following a probe into national security concerns. Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation last month into the \u00a344m sale of the company by its UK private equity owner Better Capital to Chinese aerospace and mining firm Shaanxi Ligeance Mineral Resources. The probe came after the UK business secretary Greg Clark intervened. Northern Aerospace is based in County Durham and employs 600 people. It designs and makes aeroplane components for carriers including Airbus, Boeing and Gulfstream. Better Capital said this morning: Permission to complete the sale was not obtained from the Competition and Markets Authority by the revised contractual deadline, despite requests for such permission by both parties. Accordingly the proposed transaction has lapsed. Mothercare shares fell more than 12% in early trading to 25.2p, and are now changing hands at 26.17p. The new shares are being issued at 19p. On the corporate front, struggling retailer Mothercare has announced details of its restructuring and refinancing package as it fights for survival. It plans to cut 900 jobs, 100 more than previously announced, and put its Children\u2019s World subsidiary into administration. The move comes after landlords rejected the company\u2019s proposals for rent reductions for Children\u2019s World stores last month. Mothercare will now close a total of 60 out of its 137 stores, 10 more than it said in May. These will be carried out through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which allows companies to shut loss-making shops and secure rental discounts. It expects to make annual savings of about \u00a310m following the closures, and also plans to raise \u00a332.5m from existing shareholders through a rights issue. You can read the full story here. Last week, German finance minister Olaf Scholz warned that Washington\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on imports from China and the EU would damage everyone. Donald Trump threatened last month to impose a 20% tariff on imports of all vehicles assembled in the EU. He imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imported from the EU, Canada and Mexico at the start of June. The EU and Canada hit back with their own levies on US goods. German trade data this morning show that the country\u2019s trade surplus widened in May \u2013 despite Europe\u2019s trade dispute with the US. Exports rose 1.8% on the month, according to data from the Federal Statistics Office in Berlin, while imports increased 0.7%. This pushed the trade surplus up to \u20ac20.3bn in May from \u20ac19bn in April \u2013 better than expected. Carsten Brzeski at ING says: The latest weakening of the euro should bring some relief in the coming months, more than offsetting current US tariffs on European aluminium and steel. Looking ahead and despite the very benign impact of trade tensions so far, a fully fledged trade war would surely leave negative marks on the German economy. Markets are hoping for further clues about a tightening to monetary policy when European Central Bank president Mario Draghi speaks at the European parliament in Brussels this afternoon. CMC\u2019s Madden says: Traders will be listening carefully to the central banker\u2019s speech as it may give away clues to possible changes to the monetary policy. Last month, the head of the ECB announced the bond-buying scheme would be wound down at the end of the year. Mr Draghi also suggested that interest rates are unlikely to be hiked until at least the back end of 2019. The currency bloc has been going through a mixed economic period, and Mr Draghi\u2019s update could give an insight into what the central banker is thinking. European markets have risen at the open. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 0.4% Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.4% France\u2019s CAC up 0.5% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.2% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.5% Portugal\u2019s PSI 20 up 0.3% David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The pound is holding up relatively well. This will put severe pressure on Prime Minister May, and there are questions being asked about how long she will last in the top job. Trade remains in focus globally, with Donald Trump heading to Europe this week for the NATO summit. He has already voiced his opinion that the US pays a large share of the NATO budget. Madden says: Mr Trump is still playing the \u2018America first\u2019 card, and there is a possibility that global trading relations could take a further knock. Last week there were signs that the relationship between the EU and the US were improving, after it was reported that the Trump administration is contemplating rowing back on the threat to impose 20% tariffs on EU cars. It was also reported that Angela Merkel is considering throwing her weight behind the proposal of cutting levies on US cars into the EU. The embattled prime minister, Theresa May, is expected to reshuffle her cabinet sometime after 9am following Davis\u2019 resignation. You can read the latest on our politics live blog. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at online forex broker FXTM, says: The pound was surprisingly steady after the resignation of the Brexit secretary David Davis. Trading the pound is going to be tricky in the coming days and will depend predominantly on how the negotiations with the EU develop after Davis\u2019 resignation and the survival of Theresa May. However, from Monday\u2019s market reaction, traders seem to believe we\u2019re still heading towards a soft Brexit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. The trade war between America and China began on Friday, when both Washington and Beijing imposed 25% tariffs on a number of imports. The US fired the opening salvo, imposing levies on $34bn of Chinese imports, including aerospace, IT and medical kit. China hit back with tariffs on products such as soybeans, chemicals and some cars. But markets have taken the escalating trade dispute in their stride. European stocks are expected to open higher after Asian stocks rallied overnight. Worries over the trade dispute ebbed away on Friday when non-farm payrolls data showed stronger-than-expected US job growth and steady wage gains, suggesting the Federal Reserve will stick to gradual interest rate increases, and pushing US stocks higher that day. The pound wobbled after the shock resignation of UK Brexit secretary David Davis and Brexit ministers Steven Baker and Suella Braverman. Sterling weakened to $1.3290 when the news broke, but has since recovered and hit its highest level since 14 June this morning. It\u2019s now trading 0.2% higher at $1.3321. Against the euro, it has been steady at 88.38p. Central bankers including Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi are due to speak today.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest round of tit-for-tat tariffs by the United States and China has intensified the global debate about whether the world is facing a mere trade skirmish or heading rapidly toward a full-blown trade war. But what is really at stake may be even more fundamental. Either accidentally or by design, Donald Trump\u2019s administration may have paved the way for a \u201cReagan moment\u201d for the international trade regime. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan initiated a military spending race with the Soviet Union that ended up altering the global balance of power in ways that affected many countries worldwide. Today, Trump has launched a tariff race with China, an economic superpower, perhaps with similarly far-reaching potential consequences. Like under Reagan, the US is better placed to win the current competition with China \u2013 but the risks are sizeable. In the latest escalation of the trade dispute, the US imposed levies on $34bn (\u00a326bn) worth of Chinese imports. China immediately implemented retaliatory tariffs, spurring the US to threaten even more protectionist measures. These actions exacerbate tensions over the Trump administration\u2019s imposition of tariffs on imports from other countries, including some of America\u2019s closest allies (such as Canada), and its threats to withdraw from the World Trade Organisation, which undergirds the rules-based system regulating cross-border flows of goods, services and capital. Many existing trade agreements would benefit from modernisation. And most economists agree that the US has genuine trade grievances against China, including intellectual property theft, asymmetrical technology transfers and non-tariff barriers, such as the requirement that foreign companies enter joint-venture agreements with domestic firms to access the Chinese market. But most economists also agree that competitive tariffs are a risky way to address these grievances. Because tariffs transmit stagflationary pressures (that is, they encourage simultaneous economic contraction and inflation), they risk undermining a global recovery that is already facing challenges. And they complicate long-overdue monetary-policy normalisation, while increasing the likelihood of global financial instability. The resulting systemic cracks could jeopardise the entire rules-based multilateral trading system at a time when there is no good alternative. Many economists hesitate on precisely what lies ahead. For example, one group, while recognising that the current tensions increase the risk of a policy accident or mistake, views them as part of a process of posturing and negotiation. When push comes to shove, they argue, the world\u2019s major trade powers will avoid a mutually destructive approach, opting instead for negotiations that yield a still-free but fairer regime. Reinforcing this view are preliminary indications that the European Union may now be willing to consider a zero-tariff automobile initiative. Another group, citing historical precedent, warns that beggar-thy-neighbour trade measures can quickly spiral out of control, taking a heavy toll on living standards. At a time of pronounced political polarisation, anti-establishment anger and mistrust of expert opinion \u2013 owing to economic disappointments and widespread fear of cultural and technological change \u2013 heightened protectionism would likely fuel even greater nationalism, populism and inward-looking policymaking. But the comparison to Reagan suggests that there may be other, broader implications. By forcing the Soviet Union into a military spending race that only the US could win (at the cost of rising debt and a higher risk of conflict), Reagan accelerated the demise of what he called the \u201cevil empire\u201d. It was a bold and risky strategy that ultimately changed the political map of Europe. Even before the Soviet Union\u2019s demise, resulting in 15 new countries, its European \u201cempire\u201d had collapsed. The Berlin Wall had fallen, bringing German reunification, and Yugoslavia was disintegrating. Soon after, Czechoslovakia\u2019s \u201cVelvet Divorce\u201d gave rise to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which \u2013 together with other central and eastern European countries (including Hungary and Poland) \u2013 then anchored themselves firmly in the west by joining Nato and the EU. Today, a trade war would damage all economies. But the US \u2013 which is relatively less dependent on foreign markets, possesses deeper domestic markets and is generally more economically resilient than other countries \u2013 would do better than most others in a contracting world economy. Already, Chinese financial markets have suffered, while those in the US have held their own. Game theory suggests that rational actors, recognising how damaging a trade war would be for them, would see the merit of abandoning a retaliatory strategy, and instead accede to many US demands. All of this could leave the US more able and willing to halt the multi-year erosion of its global economic influence and standing. But the success of this approach is far from guaranteed. Its execution will require more mutual trust than is currently on offer. A divided US public will need to be kept on board throughout the retaliatory phase, which will lead to higher prices and, in some cases, greater job insecurity. Furthermore, the Trump administration will need to avoid actually pushing other countries (especially China) too hard too soon, thereby threatening the entire global economy with a possible recession and markets with disorderly declines. Already, the US Federal Reserve, relying on its contacts in the domestic business community, has warned that corporate investment plans could be \u201cscaled back or postponed\u201d because of uncertainty over global trade relations. And let us not forget that China holds a massive volume of US Treasury bonds which, if pushed too hard, it could use to try to destabilise the US government bond market, which is essential to the health of the global financial system. It is too early to say whether a \u201cReagan moment\u201d on trade will play out and deliver more than a fairer system. After all, such an approach would require careful strategic design and skilful implementation \u2013 not to mention plenty of good luck \u2013 guided by a nuanced understanding of economic, political, and geopolitical factors. That is why we must move beyond the question of whether this is a trade skirmish or a trade war to develop real strategies for the \u201cTrump trade moment\u201d, should it arrive. \u2022 Mohamed El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz and was chairman of Barack Obama\u2019s Global Development Council \u2022\u00a9 Project Syndicate",

      "bodyText": "The struggling retailer Mothercare is to cut 900 jobs, 100 more than previously announced, as it put its Children\u2019s World subsidiary into administration. The move comes after landlords rejected the company\u2019s proposals for rent reductions for Children\u2019s World stores last month. Mothercare will now close 60 of its 137 stores, 10 more than it said in May. These will be carried out through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which allows firms to shut loss-making shops and secure rental discounts. It expects to make annual savings of about \u00a310m with the closures, and plans to raise \u00a332.5m from existing shareholders through a rights issue. Clive Whiley, the group\u2019s interim executive chairman, said: \u201cWhilst the lack of full approval for the Children\u2019s World CVA was disappointing, we have now found a solution which allows us to go further and faster with the right-sizing of our store portfolio. We have also identified significant areas for further efficiencies and cost savings, which will underpin our return to a sustainable future. \u201cNotwithstanding the unavoidable impact the measures will have upon some of the group\u2019s employees, we have to act with urgency to mitigate the headwinds being experienced by the UK retail sector as a whole.\u201d Mothercare has been hit by the problems facing traditional high street retailers, including a squeeze on consumer spending and the threat of online competition. But shoppers have also said the business is old fashioned and \u201cfuddy-duddy\u201d. Mothercare\u2019s chief executive, Mark Newton-Jones, said the refinancing would help revitalise the business. \u201cWe have seen an unprecedented period for UK retail and we have not been alone in facing a number of strong headwinds,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to say however, that we are now in a position to refocus on our customers and improve the Mothercare brand both in the UK and across the globe. \u201cWe have exciting plans ahead to revitalise the brand through enhancing our product ranges, improving our design and value, developing our digital and multichannel proposition and investing in our people.\u201d Following news of the cash call, Mothercare shares slumped 9% to just 26p.",

These will be carried out through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which allows firms to shut loss-making shops and secure rental discounts.</p> <p>It expects to make annual savings of about \u00a310m with the closures, and plans to raise \u00a332.5m from existing shareholders through a rights issue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/06/uk-high-street-sales-fall-for-fifth-month-running\">UK high street sales fall for fifth month running</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clive Whiley, the group\u2019s interim executive chairman, said: \u201cWhilst the lack of full approval for the Children\u2019s World CVA was disappointing, we have now found a solution which allows us to go further and faster with the right-sizing of our store portfolio. We have also identified significant areas for further efficiencies and cost savings, which will underpin our return to a sustainable future.</p> <p>\u201cNotwithstanding the unavoidable impact the measures will have upon some of the group\u2019s employees, we have to act with urgency to mitigate the headwinds being experienced by the UK retail sector as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>Mothercare has been hit by the problems facing traditional high street retailers, including a squeeze on consumer spending and the threat of online competition. But shoppers have also said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/01/mothercare-to-close-50-stores-as-part-of-rescue-package\">the business is old fashioned and \u201cfuddy-duddy\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Mothercare\u2019s chief executive, Mark Newton-Jones, said the refinancing would help revitalise the business. </p> <p>\u201cWe have seen an unprecedented period for UK retail and we have not been alone in facing a number of strong headwinds,\u201d he said.</p> <p> \u201cI\u2019m pleased to say however, that we are now in a position to refocus on our customers and improve the Mothercare brand both in the UK and across the globe. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have exciting plans ahead to revitalise the brand through enhancing our product ranges, improving our design and value, developing our digital and multichannel proposition and investing in our people.\u201d</p> <p>Following news of the cash call, Mothercare shares slumped 9% to just 26p.</p>",
