      "bodyText": "Over the next few years, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that any new car or truck you might buy will come equipped with one of two \u201cinfotainment\u201d systems: Apple or Android. An infotainment system is the successor to the car stereo \u2013 a system that combines audio entertainment functions with vehicle information. Like the phones most of us carry in our pockets, the majority of vehicle infotainment systems now tap into either of the two brands of smartphone technology, and sometimes both. Both Apple Car Play and Android Auto allow users to project smartphone applications onto a vehicle\u2019s dash-mounted infotainment screen, making it unnecessary to balance the phone on the steering column or clamp it in an unwieldy windshield suction cup mount. The idea is to reduce driver distraction by integrating smartphone functions into the car\u2019s controls while disabling certain features while the car is in motion. Among the world\u2019s largest automakers, Toyota stands alone in that its electronics support neither Apple Car Play nor Android Auto. That may sound strange, but in doing so, explains Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, the world\u2019s number one automaker has held on to its independence. \u201cToyota wants to maintain control of its user interface and customer information by developing its own connected car interface,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cMost others have surrendered to the appeal and effectiveness of using outside systems, which puts Toyota at a disadvantage.\u201d Among manufacturers selling vehicles in the US, Apple\u2019s product will be available in certain models built by Audi, Ferrari, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Porsche, Volkswagen and Volvo. Android Auto will serve some of those brands \u2013 and Kia \u2013 but not Ferrari, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi or Porsche. Subaru is notably absent from both lists, but it is also much smaller than most of the other companies. At issue, Brauer says, is consumers\u2019 preference for a seamless transition between their phones and their cars, something Apple Car Play and Android Auto are able to provide. \u201cToyota will be hard pressed to match those features, at least in the near term, although eventually it could develop interfaces as intuitive as Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s.\u201d Perhaps now that infotainment technology has reached such a level, the days of auto company executives bemoaning millennials\u2019 collective disinterest in the car-owning experience will come to an end. Automakers seem to have embraced that generation\u2019s love of all things smartphone and are doing everything they can to integrate mobile technology with actual mobility \u2013 in other words, driving. At the North American International Auto Show press preview, held in Detroit this week, Ford Motor Company introduced a new high performance pickup. But executives from America\u2019s number two automaker had much more to say about Ford Pass, the \u201csmart mobility\u201d service CEO Mark Fields said he hoped would make Ford \u201ca serious player in mobility services\u201d. What does that mean? Ford wants to expand its business into ride and car sharing. Fields said that although Ford had a 4% share of an auto sales business worth more than $2tn, the company has designs on tapping into a mobility services market he says is worth $5.3tn. Ford Pass is scheduled to commence in April as a subscription-based service for both Ford owners and people who have never even thought of driving a Ford. Fields \u2013 flanked onstage by Bill Ford Jr, the company\u2019s executive chairman and, for some reason, TV personality Ryan Seacrest \u2013 said Ford Pass was the automaker\u2019s attempt to \u201creimagine the customer experience\u201d by creating more interactions with customers and thereby improving customer feedback. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to GM\u2019s OnStar, but offers a much wider spectrum of services over a broader range of needs,\u201d Brauer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong sign of Ford\u2019s desire to be more than just a car company, as well as the automaker\u2019s willingness to explore new options and business models.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Shepton Mallet cider mill that makes well-known brands including Gaymers and Blackthorn is to close with the loss of 120 jobs, dealing a major blow to the Somerset market town. Irish company C&amp;C, which makes Bulmers and Magners cider in Ireland and Tennent\u2019s lager in Scotland, will move the production of cider to its factory in Clonmel in Ireland, where it is creating 80 new jobs. Fruit will continue to be pulped at Shepton Mallet, but it will then be shipped to Ireland. This means that four full-time and up to eight seasonal workers will still work at the site. The company stressed that it would continue to buy apples from farmers in Somerset. C&amp;C is also closing its water bottling plant in Borrisoleigh in Ireland, where it employs 140 people. The Somerset site also makes Olde English cider as well as the bottled premium brand Addlestones. The business is thought to date back to the 18th century, when the Gaymer family began making cider. Unite, the UK\u2019s largest union, said it was disgraceful that the 127 workers at Shepton Mallet found out about the planned closure from media reports on Tuesday morning. C&amp;C blamed tough competition in the UK and Ireland in recent years, which has pushed prices lower and means the affected sites are running at only a third of their capacity. It said: \u201cThis has been a difficult decision for the group, and it is sad that the consolidation of production at the Clonmel site is the only viable option to maintain long-term competitiveness. C&amp;C recognises the impact on employees and will work to provide support, training, and where possible, alternative employment.\u201d The Shepton Mallet mill is expected to close in the late summer, Unite said, with the canning, bottling and kegging of cider moving to Ireland. Unite\u2019s regional coordinating officer, Steve Preddy, said: \u201cThere has been more than 240 years of cider production at Shepton Mallet, a workplace that is synonymous with historic cider production in the south-west \u2013 and now this is coming to an end. This is a grievous blow to the workforce, their families, the town and the Somerset economy.\u201d The union said it would seek an urgent meeting with the C&amp;C management to hear the reasons for the closure. The MP for Wells, which covers Shepton Mallet, James Heappey, said the priority now was to ensure that workers who are losing their jobs would be offered appropriate retraining. He blamed C&amp;C\u2019s \u201cpoor commercial decisions\u201d for the closure. Heappey told the Shepton Mallet Journal: \u201cWhen I visited the Shepton cider mill last summer \u2026 I saw a factory that had enjoyed significant investment and was manufacturing a world-class product. \u201cOther large cider makers are, indeed, enjoying growth and making investment in new facilities locally. It would appear that Shepton\u2019s closure is nothing to do with the cider mill nor the cider market, but poor commercial decisions taken by Irish parent company C&amp;C. It is an incredible shame that Shepton Mallet \u2013 the beating heart of the global cider industry \u2013 may soon be without any major cider manufacturing.\u201d The company\u2019s website states: \u201cHere in the town of Shepton Mallet, high in the Mendips and away from the floods, an ancient borehole provided a natural source of water \u2013 perfect for the milling and blending of a most refreshing and distinctive Somerset cider. And now, as then, at Shepton Mallet cider mill, making cider isn\u2019t just our passion \u2013 it\u2019s a way of life.\u201d",

Last year, the US solar industry grew by 20% for a third year in a row, according to the foundation\u2019s National Solar Job Census 2015. By the end of 2015, it employed nearly 209,000 solar workers, more than those employed in oil and gas extraction. However, the growth in the solar industry was not shared equally across all types of jobs. Manufacturing, project development, and sales jobs have all remained steady over the past five years. Only the jobs in installation increased, from 43,934 jobs in 2010 to 119,931 in 2015. \u201cEmployees of installation companies accounted for 22,900 or 65% of the new jobs added in 2015,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe US solar installation sector employs 77% more people than the domestic coal mining industry. Since 2014, solar installation has created more jobs than oil and gas pipeline construction and crude petroleum and natural gas extraction combined.\u201d According to the US Department of Labor, there were just 184,500 Americans working in oil and gas extraction in December 2015 \u2013 nearly 17,000 fewer workers than a year ago. While compared to a year ago the number of oil and gas jobs has gone down, five years ago there were only 160,000 jobs in the field. The industry peaked in employment terms a year ago when it reached 201,200 jobs. Last month, there were 191,900 mining jobs in the US, down from 203,700 a year ago. Nevertheless, the US Department of Labor continues to focus on the positive effects of cheap oil. \u201cThe average American household \u2013 because of gas prices going below $2 a gallon \u2013 they had an additional $500 to $800 in their pocket to spend last year. That\u2019s enormously helpful and what happens is they spend it. You have more consumer demand \u2013 the business have to hire,\u201d Tom Perez, the US Secretary of Labor, said Friday. \u201cSo while certainly we have seen the mining sector suffer an undeniable decline in employment, on balance for the American consumer gasoline below $2 is a boon.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sell (almost) everything, says Andrew Roberts, Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s credit guru. Unfortunately for George Osborne this advice has arrived late in the day for a chancellor seeking to flog more than a few shares in RBS itself. The Treasury managed to get rid of 5% of RBS last August at 330p, taking the state\u2019s stake to 73%, but since then nothing has happened. Nor will it if the RBS share price remains below 300p. The big idea last autumn was that the mere act of starting to sell shares in RBS would lead to better prices in future as the outside world came to recognise that the bank was escaping the clutches of the state and marching down the road to full privatisation. The theory was sensible but the practical fact of RBS\u2019s share price at 283p, within pennies of an 18-month low, surely disqualifies further sales for the time being. Delay to the RBS disposal programme was always possible. But flogging the last part of Lloyds Banking Group was supposed to be an easy task for Osborne. Suddenly, that ambition looks tricky with Lloyds shares at 69.3p. Under the drip-feed programme, which has reduced the state\u2019s stake to 9%, sales are prohibited below 73.6p, the break-even price. And, if the drip-feed programme is stalled, can Osborne really go ahead with his parallel idea to exit Lloyds with a flourish this spring by selling \u00a32bn worth of discounted shares to the public? Technically, he can. But it would be highly embarrassing, politically speaking, to sell Lloyds shares to private punters at a loss to the public purse. A lot can happen in coming weeks. Stock markets could recover and Lloyds\u2019 full-year results, due next month, could be sparkling. But, as matters stand, Osborne is looking at the possibility that, in his March budget, he could be announcing he has missed his borrowing target and the feel-good Lloyds retail offer has had to be postponed. No wonder he sounded so gloomy at new year. Scraping the oil barrel How low can the price of oil, which approached $30 a barrel yesterday, go? Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs say $20. Standard Chartered thinks $10. Reinforcing the air of bearishness, BP has announced yet another round of job losses \u2013 some 4,000 posts will go, including 600 in operations in the North Sea. In the current climate, almost any guess for the short-term oil price sounds credible. The world is producing about 1m barrels a day more than it currently needs; the Opec cartel is in chaos, unable to agree production quotas; and Iranian oil will arrive on world markets with the lifting of sanctions. As Standard Chartered rightly says, in this environment the oil price can be driven lower by financial factors, such as a strong dollar. Remember, though, that the pressing question is not so much \u201chow low?\u201d but \u201cfor how long?\u201d The answer to the latter question, unfortunately, is equally obscure. It is possible to make an argument that the market could be under-supplied by the end of this year. Demand for oil is still rising \u2013 even in China, at least for now \u2013 and production in the US or Russia could fall with investment cuts. That, at least, is the hope to which the producers cling. But, in truth, if their wishes are to be granted, it has to happen soon. Here\u2019s an industry insider\u2019s rule of thumb: if sub-$40 is the average price for this year, dividends are toast at all the major producers; and if sub-$40 extends into 2017, then there will be budget crises in Russia and a fair number of Gulf states. \u2018Triumph\u2019 for Morrisons In the world of supermarkets, a land of shrunken expectations, a barely visible 0.2% rise in like-for-like sales counts as a triumph. Well, it does if you\u2019re Morrisons. The lift in the nine-week Christmas period was the group\u2019s first positive reading for four years. But let\u2019s not be too churlish. Suddenly, Morrisons\u2019 balance sheet is starting to look like a port in a storm. From \u00a32.34bn a year ago, the group now reckons debt will be \u00a31.65bn-\u00a31.8bn at the end of this month. It helps, of course, that Morrisons has been flogging a few supermarkets, plus its convenience stores, but that reduction in borrowing represents progress. Even after a cut in the dividend last year, the yield is 3%. Decent balance sheet, safe-ish dividend and \u2013 possibly \u2013 stability on the sales line? It could be worse. Beleaguered Asda could yet turn nasty, but one can understand why Morrisons\u2019 shares rose 9%. Apologies from ex-BBA chief Bankers used to have great difficulty apologising but Angela Knight, their former lobbyist at the British Bankers\u2019 Association, barely stopped doing so yesterday. \u201cI am so sorry I ended up at the BBA during the banking crisis. I\u2019m so sorry it chose me to be its target,\u201d she told the Treasury select committee. The MPs are assessing if Knight is a suitable chair of the Office of Tax Simplification. The BBA, supposedly in charge of Libor during the time of the rate-rigging scandal, has much to answer for, but Knight herself probably deserves a break. Lobbying for banks was not a pretty job, but it was never an illegal activity and shouldn\u2019t be a bar to fresh employment.",

      "bodyText": "After months of decline, Etsy briefly lost more than 7% of its share value on Tuesday, as the market continued to offload one of the startup world\u2019s riskiest bets. The stock recovered shortly after noon but remained well below its opening. Some have attributed the falloff, which began Monday, to the expiration of a \u201clockup\u201d agreement, which freed some shareholders to sell their portion of the company on the open market for the first time. Another such agreement will expire in April. The e-commerce company, which specializes in goods handmade by its large community of sellers, has only been publicly traded since April and has since adopted a number of unorthodox practices as it made its transition into the public sphere. Among those was the company\u2019s decision to set aside shares for those vendors \u2013 a maximum of $2,500 worth available in advance of the IPO\u2019s pricing. The company\u2019s high-minded resolution to carry forth its handcrafted ethos into stock exchanges around the world has been met with some resistance, however: the stock reached a previous all-time-low in November, when it reported its Q3 earnings and revealed that it had lost 6 cents per share and had seen declines in its overseas businesses. Etsy began to draw criticism from analysts almost immediately. \u201cWe expect Etsy to enjoy rapid near-term growth within its niche as it increases marketing spend, including a strong Q1 report on May 19,\u201d wrote Gil Luria of Wedbush just a few weeks after the IPO, when shares were on the rise. \u201cHowever, our analysis and discussions with IP lawyers lead us to believe questionable seller practices may draw increased scrutiny, eventually limiting volume growth.\u201d By June, Etsy had to bring down the hammer on sellers peddling wares of questionable authenticity or indeed existence, such as magic spells. Luria\u2019s then-pessimistic prediction for the company\u2019s shares price was $14 (it was still upward of $20 at that point). As of 1pm Tuesday, the shares hovered over $7 apiece. The company is aggressively pursuing a manufacturing division with hopes for long-term growth in that area, though it has cautioned investors \u201cnot to think of it even from a 2016 perspective as a significant contributor\u201d, as CFO Kristina Salen put it on the most recent earnings call. The company was downgraded by Roth Capital to a \u201csell\u201d with a $5.75 price target last month.",

Albert Edwards, strategist at the bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said the west was about to be hit by a wave of deflation from emerging market economies and that central banks were unaware of the disaster about to hit them. His comments came as analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland urged investors to \u201csell everything\u201d ahead of an imminent stock market crash. \u201cDevelopments in the global economy will push the US back into recession,\u201d Edwards told an investment conference in London. \u201cThe financial crisis will reawaken. It will be every bit as bad as in 2008-09 and it will turn very ugly indeed.\u201d Fears of a second serious financial crisis within a decade have been heightened by the turbulence in markets since the start of the year. Share prices have fallen rapidly and a slump in the cost of oil has left Brent crude trading at barely above $30 a barrel. \u201cCan it get any worse? Of course it can,\u201d said Edwards, the most prominent of the stock market bears \u2013 the terms for analysts who think shares are overvalued and will fall in price. \u201cEmerging market currencies are still in freefall. The US corporate sector is being crushed by the appreciation of the dollar.\u201d The Soc Gen strategist said the US economy was in far worse shape than the country\u2019s central bank, the US Federal Reserve, realised. \u201cWe have seen massive credit expansion in the US. This is not for real economic activity; it is borrowing to finance share buybacks.\u201d Edwards attacked what he said was the \u201cincredible conceit\u201d of central bankers, who had failed to learn the lessons of the housing bubble that led to the financial crisis and slump of 2008-09. \u201cThey didn\u2019t understand the system then and they don\u2019t understand how they are screwing up again. Deflation is upon us and the central banks can\u2019t see it.\u201d Edwards said the dollar had risen by as much as the Japanese yen had in the 1990s, an upwards move that pushed Japan into deflation and caused solvency problems for the Asian country\u2019s banks. He added that a sign of the crisis to come was the collapse in demand for credit in China. \u201cThat happens when people lose confidence that policymakers know what they are doing. This is what is going to happen in Europe and the US.\u201d Europe has shown tentative signs of recovery in the past year, but Edwards said the efforts of the European Central Bank to push the euro lower and growth higher would come to nothing in the event of a fresh downturn. \u201cIf the global economy goes back into recession, it is curtains for the eurozone.\u201d Countries such as France, Spain and Italy would not accept the rising unemployment that would be associated with another recession, he said. \u201cWhat a disaster the euro has been: it is a doomsday machine in favour of the German economy.\u201d The warning from Edwards came as stock markets had a respite from the wave of selling seen since the start of the year. The FTSE 100 index rose by 57 points to close at 5,929, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 10 points in early trading in New York. The mood in equity markets was helped by intervention by the People\u2019s Bank of China overnight to support the yuan, with the Chinese currency moving higher on foreign exchange markets. But the slide in the oil price continued, with Brent crude falling a further 3.5% to close in London at $30.45. Oil has not been below $30 a barrel since 2003. Edwards joked that after years in which he has tended to be a lone voice, other institutions were also becoming a lot gloomier about global prospects. He was referring to the RBS advice, which warned that investors face a \u201ccataclysmic year\u201d where stock markets could fall by up to 20% and oil could slump to $16 a barrel. In a note to its clients the bank said: \u201cSell everything except high-quality bonds. This is about return of capital, not return on capital. In a crowded hall, exit doors are small.\u201d It said the current situation was reminiscent of 2008, when the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank led to the global financial crisis. This time China could be the crisis point, RBS said.",

    "webTitle": "Tesco shares soar on rumours of a happy Christmas", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco could be about to reveal a better than expected sales performance over Christmas as it launched its fightback against the discounters. Shares in the UK\u2019s biggest retailer leapt nearly 7% to 155p on Tuesday, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, as analysts said the industry market share data suggested sales at established Tesco stores were level, and might even have risen, over the festive period. The company will reveal its Christmas trading figures on Thursday. Market share figures from analysts at Kantar Worldpanel suggested Tesco\u2019s sales had fallen 1% in the four weeks to 3 January. But Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said most of that decline could be attributed to store closures. \u201cTesco looks to have had a good Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be able to publish close to flat like-for-like [sales].\u201d Similar data from analysis firm Nielsen indicated that sales at Tesco had risen slightly in December. Dave McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, said the unexpected increase suggested the major supermarkets had pushed back against the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl last month. While Aldi and Lidl achieved a dramatic rise in sales in the three months to 3 January, up 13.3% and 18.5% respectively, analysts said most of that growth appeared to be coming from opening new stores. \u201cPerhaps the grocery world is changing a little,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThe whole industry looks like it did better than expected driven by Tesco and Morrisons while the discounters are finding it harder to grow sales in existing stores.\u201d Several analysts, including Monteyne, suggested sales at established Aldi stores may have risen by less than 1% in December as it made its lowest gain in Christmas market share since 2012. Monteyne said: \u201cThe record that discounters are going to dominate is getting a bit over-played. They have a place in the landscape but supermarkets are finding a way to hold their ground.\u201d Aldi and Lidl were still the biggest winners over the festive period with almost one in eight shoppers doing their single biggest December shop in one of the German chains. Over the 12 weeks to 3 January, nearly 16m households visited one of their stores at least once, up nearly 1m on last year and taking their combined share of Christmas spending to nearly 10%. Aldi said it had sold more than 1m turkeys before Christmas and 250,000 bottles of Veuve Monsigny champagne. \u201cWe are seeing a permanent change in the shopping habits of UK consumers. Significant numbers of shoppers are switching to Aldi,\u201d said Jonathan Neale, the joint managing director of buying. Asda had the toughest Christmas of the UK\u2019s four biggest supermarkets as the two German discounters won 1m more shoppers compared with last Christmas. Sales at the Walmart-owned chain slumped 3.5% in the 12 weeks to 3 January, according to Kantar, reducing its share of the grocery market by 0.6 percentage points to 16.2%. The performance is likely to be particularly disappointing for Asda, which has pledged to cut prices by \u00a3500m this year, as the company has not closed stores, unlike its major rivals Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s. Sainsbury\u2019s was the best performer of the big four supermarket chains, according to Kantar, as a 0.8% sales rise in the 12 weeks to 3 January helped it cement its position as the UK\u2019s second largest supermarket, ahead of Asda, with a 17% share of the grocery market. The relatively strong performance will be good news for Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, who wants investors to back a \u00a31bn-plus takeover of Home Retail Group, which owns Argos and Homebase. He will reveal the supermarket\u2019s Christmas trading figures on Wednesday, with analysts expecting a 0.7% fall in sales at established stores. Tesco was the second worst performer over the 12 weeks to 3 January, with sales down 2.7%, according to Kantar, taking its share down 0.8 percentage points to 28.3%.Morrisons\u2019 sales slid 2.6% as its share fell 0.3 percentage points to 11%. Both retailers\u2019 sales figures were affected by store closures. That effect was evident on Tuesday when Morrisons revealed a surprise uplift in sales at established stores. The major supermarkets\u2019 battle to win back shoppers from the fast-growing discounters was evident in a 1.8% year-on-year slide in the price of groceries in the 12-week period as the major chains tried to match them on key items. McKevitt said: \u201cShoppers reaped the benefit of falling prices this Christmas. The amount spent on a typical Christmas dinner fell even faster \u2013 down by 2.2% \u2013 mainly due to cheaper poultry and traditional vegetable trimmings.\u201d He said sales of alcohol increased as a result of a surge in popularity for sparkling wines including champagne and prosecco, which increased in value by 11%.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thanks to China making strong efforts to support the yuan, European markets have moved higher, albeit off their best levels. The continuing slide in oil prices has tempered some of the earlier enthusiasm, while Chinese trade data early on Wednesday is likely to cause further volatility. Meanwhile the pound hit a five and a half year low against the dollar following disappointing manufacturing data which seemed to push a UK rate rise further into the distance. The closing scores for European markets showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.98% or 57.41 points at 5929.24 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.63% to 9985.43 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.53% to 4378.75 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.08% to 19,970.10 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.33% at 8915.4 In Greece, the Athens market was 2.16% better at 594.26 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently virtually unchanged, up just 3 points while Brent crude is down 3% at $30.56. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Global oil demand is expected to grow more strongly than previously expected, according to the US Energy Information Administration. But so is US production. The EIA has raised its forecast for oil demand in 2016 by 20,000 barrels per day, and it expects 2017 world oil demand to reach 96.61m barrels, up 1.42m from the 2016 figure. It also expects US crude production to have risen by 720,000 barrels a day in 2015, from a previous forecast of 630,000. Brent crude is currently down just over 2% at $30.86 a barrel, while WTI has been close to falling below $30 a barrel. The US measure has fallen as low as $30.1 a barrel and is currently down 1% at $30.32. Despite the oil price volatility, stock markets are holding up. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: UK and European shares advanced...as global markets attempt to undo some of the damage wreaked by the tumultuous first week\u2019s trading. A higher Chinese yuan was the main source of comfort behind the rise in stocks. The price of oil was less supportive as it jumped back and forth between gains and losses near 12-year lows after a series of investment banks lowered forecasts to as low as $10 per barrel. After staging a tentative recovery earlier, the oil price has fallen into negative territory again. Brent crude, which touched $32.38 a barrel at one point has drifted back to $31.01, a 1.7% decline on the day as the dollar continues to strengthen. That\u2019s enough from Paris. Let\u2019s get back to the UK, where Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has commented on the news that BP is cutting one in five jobs in the North Sea. Our Scotland editor Severin Carrell has the story: The first minister said the BP cuts and falling oil price were \u201cdifficult\u201d and admitted the price could yet fall further, as predicted by Morgan Stanley. \u201cThis is a very difficult time indeed for people working in the North Sea,\u201d Nicola Sturgeon said. The Scottish government\u2019s North Sea jobs task force, set up a year ago after the first wave of industry cuts, would offer support the workers affected, she said. But pressed on the scale of the latest job cuts by one of the North Sea\u2019s largest operators, BP, and the plunging oil price \u2013 now at a third of the $100 a barrel price forecast by her government in the Scottish independence reference, she refused to agree that the sector was in crisis. She said BP and Oil &amp; Gas UK, the industry body, had both stressed North Sea oil had a bright future and were planning continued investment. However, Sturgeon conceded that while lower oil prices helped consumers and the wider economy through cheaper fuel costs, the job losses and cuts in oil industry spending was having a direct, negative impact on economic output. \u201cIt is undoubtedly the case that there will be a wider impact. We will look carefully at unemployment figures and at GDP figures. [Again] while I\u2019m trying to underplay the significance of the North Sea but a lower oil price has other impacts on the wider economy in terms of lower fuel costs.\u201d Britain\u2019s recovery has not been been built on rising debt within the economy, Mark Carney insists. He acknowledges that household debt levels are still relatively high, but points out that the private sector has been reducing its borrowing. However, there are now signs that consumers are borrowing more. As Carney puts it, we have moved from a post-crisis risk aversion environment to a more normal one. The challenge for central bankers such as himself, and the others huddled in Paris today, is to spot when animal spirits are getting out of hand - as a hike in borrowing costs would still hurt reckless borrowers: There\u2019s an \u201cugly rumour\u201d that global regulators are planning Basel 4 - a new set of regulations to keep banks in check - says Carney. And it\u2019s not true. Mark Carney is now speaking at the \u201cChristian Noyer\u201d symposium in Paris. But the current Bank of England governor may not say much to move the markets - he\u2019s \u2018in blackout\u2019 ahead of Thursday\u2019s interest rate decision. Instead, he\u2019s outlining how UK banks\u2019 profitability has fallen since the financial crisis: That is partly because they\u2019re taking on less leverage, due to tougher regulation post-crisis, and partly because they\u2019ve stumping up such hefty penalties to cover bad behaviour in the past. That misconduct charge should fall in the future, as banks clean up their game, Carney suggests, adding that retail banking is still very profitable in an environment of ultra-low interest rates. The UK thinktank NIESR has just issued its latest forecast for UK growth. And it predicts that the economy slightly picked up speed in the last three months of 2015, growing by 0.6%. That would be an increased on the 0.4% recorded between July and September. Is that too optimistic, given the weakness of the manufacturing sector? We get the official first estimate of GDP for the last quarter of 2015 in a couple of weeks, on the 28th of January. There\u2019s a chilly mood in the City this afternoon. No, not the weather (although it is a little brisk). It\u2019s because Albert Edwards, the notoriously pessimistic analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, is starting to deliver his annual assessment of the markets. You can probably set your dial to \u2018gloom\u2019 Albert can certainly pull in the crowds.... Back in Paris, Sheila Bair - head of the Systemic Risk Council - is warning of potential trouble ahead. She points out that governments typically pay down debt during recoveries - this time, borrowing is going up and up. Wall Street clearly didn\u2019t get the memo to sell everything. Shares are up in early New York trading, following Europe\u2019s lead. And the oil price has now turned positive today, up 2% at $32.16, on hopes that the situation in Chinese is calming down. The IMF have uploaded Christine Lagarde\u2019s speech here. It ends with a call to arms to help emerging economies: According to some estimates, a successful convergence process in the emerging world could triple the size of the global economy in the next 25 or 30 years. The global community cannot afford the costs of stalled convergence. The 85 percent matter! Lagarde concludes her speech by wishing Christian Noyer a happy retirement following his time at the Bank of France. She suggests he takes a tip from Mervyn King - who left the Bank of England vowing to learn to cook and dance. Good idea, but Noyer should avoid emulating Lord King\u2019s other hobby -- supporting Aston Villa. Christine Lagarde is now explaining how the IMF is pushing for a new global approach to financial stability, to help emerging markets. She says we need two things: 1) a stronger financial safety net. 2) a better framework for safer capital flows. On the safety net, the IMF chief says the current situation is simply unfair. Emerging markets are locked out of the \u201cswap lines\u201d between central banks that provide essential support in times of crisis. This makes the global safety net stronger for advanced countries than it is for emerging economies. Yet emerging economies critically depend on advanced-country currencies in their trade and finance. The size of the current safety nets also need to be reviewed, she adds. And on capital flows, Lagarde says emerging markets suffer from the \u201cshort-term nature and inherent volatility\u201d of global capital flows (as investors in advanced economies look for a decent rate of return). Maybe hot money is too hot, Lagarde suggests. More long-term, equity based, financial flows would help - meaning financial buffers could be smaller. You can watch Christine Lagarde\u2019s speech here. Over in Paris, Christine Lagarde is speaking at the symposium to mark the retirement of former French central bank chief Christian Noyer. The head of the International Monetary Fund starts by touching on China, saying its economic rebalancing is a positive long-term move, but one that brings short-term spillover effects. And she warns that commodity prices are unlikely to rally strongly anytime soon. She says last month\u2019s US interest rate rise has been successful. It was \u201cclearly communicated and priced in by markets\u201d, but the key point is how the future normalisation of monetary policy is handled by the Federal Reserve. And on emerging markets, Lagarde warns that the appreciation of the US dollar comes at a tricky time - with developing markets already facing slower growth and falling commodity prices. If emerging market growth falls by 1%, that knocks 0.2% off advanced economy\u2019s GDP. That\u2019s significant, she insists, given the current growth rates of advanced countries. Although shares are picking up today, there\u2019s still plenty of nervousness about the future. And analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland have added to the nerves, by telling clients they should sell up before markets really hit trouble. Our markets reporter Nick Fletcher explains: Investors face a \u201ccataclysmic year\u201d where stock markets could fall by up to 20% and oil could slump to $16 (\u00a311) a barrel, economists at the Royal Bank of Scotland have warned. In a note to its clients the bank said: \u201cSell everything except high quality bonds. This is about return of capital, not return on capital. In a crowded hall, exit doors are small.\u201d It said the current situation was reminiscent of 2008, when the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank led to the global financial crisis. This time China could be the crisis point. Here\u2019s the full story: Over in the Telegraph, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard\u2019s mood has also darkened. He warns: The risk is that this market storm drags on long enough to hit investment, regardless of what the economic data should imply. At the end of the day, market psychology can itself become an economic \u201cfundamental\u201d. Pessimists warn that unless there is a batch of irrefutably good data from China over the next two or three months, the sell-off could become self-fulfilling and quickly metamorphose into the next global crisis. Shares are rallying across Europe as investors shrug off their worries about China, and Britain\u2019s manufacturing malaise. They are taking heart from Beijing\u2019s strong stance on the yuan earlier today, when it aggressively supported its currency in the international markets. That is seen as a sign that China isn\u2019t planning to spark a full-blown currency war by allowing the yuan to devalue wildly. So, the German DAX has jumped by almost 2.5%, with other indices close behind. German manufacturers are leading the way, such as Volkswagen (+4%), BMW (+3.3%) and BASF (+2.9%). Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says some stability appears to have returned to the markets: There is a feeling that perhaps the selling pressure that has characterised stock markets last week may ease somewhat, as profit-taking among shorts and bargain hunting takes hold. However, with earnings season now underway, the selloff seen in 2016 so far could provide great buying opportunities for those expecting to see positive updates. The City is also cheered by this morning\u2019s financial results, which saw retailers Morrisons and Debenhams both beat forecasts. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, points out that the fall in the pound should help UK manufacturers. But November\u2019s weak performance may show the sector dragged the economy back at the end of 2015. Beck says: \u201cIndustrial production fell by 0.7% between October and November, with all four of the sub-sectors seeing output decline. This was the largest monthly fall in output since January 2013. \u201cThe biggest cause for concern is the manufacturing sector, where output declined by 0.4% for a second successive month in November. This may have followed a very strong September, but the business surveys continue to point to \u2013 at best \u2013 stagnation. Although the recent fall in the pound should provide some support to exporters, it is difficult to find many other reasons for optimism around the manufacturing sector. \u201cWith manufacturing on course for only modest output growth in Q4 and the other components of industrial production likely to have contracted, the economy is going to be almost wholly reliant on services to drive growth once again. Our short-term model continues to point to GDP growth of 0.6% in Q4, up from 0.5% in Q3. But there is now a risk that the preliminary estimate \u2013 due in just over two weeks\u2019 time \u2013 shows another below-par outturn of 0.5%.\u201d Looks like China will be in focus tomorrow too, when we discover how well (or badly) it traded with the rest of the world... Britain\u2019s unions know who to blame for Britain\u2019s manufacturing decline - finance minister George Osborne. The chancellor warned last week that a \u2018cocktail of risks\u2019 threaten the UK, including China\u2019s slowing economy. But TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady reckons the blame lies closer to home: \u201cGeorge Osborne\u2019s cocktail of threats has been spiked with his own failures. Not least of these is manufacturing, which is still far behind its pre-crisis peak and has fallen by 1.2 per cent over the last year. \u201cIf the government had made the right choices with strong investment in skills, infrastructure and innovation, we could be in a much stronger position.\u201d O\u2019Grady also points out that UK steel production has shrunk by a third from its recent peak, as UK factories struggle to cope with falling prices and competition from abroad. \u201cSteel production has seen its sharpest fall since the financial crisis. This is the inevitable result of the government\u2019s failure to step in and give UK steel the support it needs. Unless the government puts in place a genuine industrial strategy, we risk further serious consequences for steel and many other manufacturers down the supply chain.\u201d Thousands of oil workers at BP face the axe, as the company adjusts to the new era of cheaper oil. Reuters has the story: Oil major BP plans to cut at least 4,000 jobs globally in its oil production division this year to reduce costs amid a steep decline in oil prices. \u201cWe want to simplify structure and reduce costs without compromising safety. Globally, we expect the headcount in upstream to be below 20,000 by the end of the year,\u201d a company spokesman said. He said BP was planning to reduce headcount by 600 people in the North Sea over the next two years with most cuts to happen in 2016. Back to oil.,.. and Nigeria\u2019s suggestion today that OPEC could hold an emergency meeting soon has been slapped down by the United Arab Emirates. UAE energy minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui argued that the cartel\u2019s current strategy (not cutting production) should be given more time. Mazroui said: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced OPEC alone can change or can solely unilaterally change this strategy just because we have seen a low in the market.\u201d After November\u2019s weak performance, Britain\u2019s industrial production sector is still around 9% smaller than before the crisis. Britain\u2019s failure/inability (take your pick) to expand its manufacturing sector in the last 15 years has meant we\u2019ve run a persistent current account deficit, with imports consistently outpacing exports. But does it matter, when the services sector fills some (but not all) of the gap? An economist who blogs as Polemic Paine argues that Britain should embrace the fact that other countries can manufacturer goods much cheaper than us: The UK is the second largest exporter of services in the world and the US economy is currently 88% services. In a competitive world it is better to export high value goods rather than low value goods unless you can make those low value goods at such low prices that (price x volume) = big. Whilst there are countries with populations willing to accept lower wages than us for their day\u2019s work we have to sell goods they can\u2019t. And that is now mostly services..... He concludes: Once upon a time the UK\u2019s agricultural industry accounted for 90% of the country\u2019s economy. It is now about 3%. Should we readjust back to that too for nostalgias sake? As long as we are exporting services that pay for the lower valued manufacturing stuff we buy in then that\u2019s fine. Yet services are lost in the data. The historic way of measuring trade data demotes many services into the invisibles part of the equation leaving attention resting on the more obvious manufacturing figures.  Here\u2019s the full piece: Weak week. Waiting. I guess people would worry less if services was able to cover *all* the shortfall from the trade in goods: There\u2019s also the worry that financial services can turn around and bite the economy when a crisis erupts (plus the \u2018implicit subsidy\u2019 that taxpayers cough up to protect them from failure) JP Morgan reckons that first UK rate rise is now 10 months away. Economist Malcolm Barr explains: Recent disappointments in the pay data and the drop in oil prices had already put our call for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to raise rates in May at risk. The weakness in this IP report is the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. We hence push our forecast for the first hike back by 6 months to November 2016. The forecast shows rates rising by 25bp a quarter thereafter. In our minds, the MPC are very much in \u201cdata dependent\u201d mode, rather than feeling at all constrained to adhere to any path suggested by their commentary. There\u2019s certainly little chance that the Bank of England will raise interest rates this week: Our best guess is that the MPC vote will remain at 8-1 at this week\u2019s meeting, although these data raise the risk that McCafferty will choose to withdraw his vote for higher rates for now. \u201c Sterling has fallen to its lowest level against the US dollar since early June 2010, following the disappointing UK industrial production data. The pound has shed half a cent, touching $1.4484, as traders calculate that there\u2019s no prospect of interest rates rising soon. Jake Trask, currency analyst at UKForex, explains: \u201cBoth industrial and manufacturing production have posted lower-than-expected readings for November. Combined with soft growth figures and Brexit fears, these results will likely dampen any expectations of a UK interest rate rise in the near future\u201d. The FT points out that UK manufacturing has been weakening for several months: Just in: Britain\u2019s industrial sector suffered its biggest fall in output in almost three years, as manufacturing shrank again. Industrial production shank by 0.7% month-on-month, according to the Office for National Statistics. That\u2019s the biggest drop since January 2013, and much worse than expected. It says: There were decreases in all of the main sectors, with manufacturing, mining &amp; quarrying and electricity &amp; gas having the largest contributions to the decrease. This can partly be blamed on the unusually warm winter, which has meant less demand for energy to heat homes and businesses. But manufacturing struggled too; its output fell by 0.4% in November compared with October, and was 1.2% lower than a year ago. It suggests British business are suffering from weaker overseas demand, partly due to China\u2019s economic worries. It leaves the government\u2019s vision of a rebalanced economy led by a revitalised factory sector looking as distant as ever. And it also highlights why demand for oil is weak, leading to supply gluts and sliding prices. Many US oil producers will suffer severe financial pain, and possibly go bust, unless the oil price recovers from its current lows, analysts fear. Marketwatch has the details: As many as a third of American oil-and-gas producers could tip toward bankruptcy and restructuring by mid-2017, according to Wolfe Research. Survival, for some, would be possible if oil rebounded to at least $50, according to analysts. The benchmark price of U.S. crude settled at $31.41 a barrel, setting a 12-year low. More than 30 small companies that collectively owe in excess of $13 billion have already filed for bankruptcy protection so far during this downturn, according to law firm Haynes &amp; Boone. More here: Plunging prices could force a third of U.S. oil firms into bankruptcy Retail magnate turned football chairman Mike Ashley could suffer a double relegation this year. Shares in his Sports Direct chain have fallen by almost 4% this morning, as the aftermath of last Friday\u2019s profit warning continues to reverberate. Yesterday they tumbled by 7%, as analysts scramble to reassess their view of the company\u2019s prospects. Sports Direct is currently valued at \u00a32.4bn, which is not enough to maintain a place in the FTSE 100 index. And with Newcastle United 18th (two from bottom) in the Premier League, it could be a year to forget for the club\u2019s owner. This chart shows how Beijing drove up the interest rate on offshore yuan deposits overnight, in a bid to strengthen the currency. This was designed to \u2018encourage\u2019 traders to hold renminbi and inflict losses on speculators who were betting against it. The latest slump in the oil price isn\u2019t causing alarm in the European stock markets. Instead, shares are rallying as traders applaud China\u2019s aggressive moves to prop up the yuan overnight. The German DAX has gained 1%, bringing some relief to Frankfurt where investors have been worrying about a global downturn. In London, the FTSE 100 gained half a percent. But there\u2019s been so much volatility this year that markets may not stay higher for long..... Debenhams has also beaten festive expectations, posting a 1.9% jump in like-for-like sales over Christmas. That\u2019s rather better than its main rival, Marks &amp; Spencer, which posted a 5.8% decline in general merchandise sales. M&amp;S blamed unusually warm weather, but clearly some retailers coped better than others ... 2015 was a rough year for UK supermarket chain Morrisons, as it struggled to cope with falling sales and profits. But this year has begun better, with the company beating forecasts over the crucial Christmas period. My colleague Sean Farrell explains: Morrisons achieved a surprise increase in sales over Christmas as customers returned to the supermarket chain. Sales at stores open a year or more, excluding fuel, rose 0.2% in the nine weeks to 3 January, Morrisons said in a trading statement. City analysts had expected like-for-like sales, which exclude new stores, to fall 2%. Morrisons said customers were starting to return to its stores with like-for-like transactions up 1.3% in its core supermarkets during the period. The chain has been badly hit by competition from the German discounters Aldi and Lidl and has cut prices to compete. And the City likes the news - sending its shares soaring 12% in early trading. Other supermarkets are benefitting too - Tesco shares are up 5.5%, and Sainsbury\u2019s has gained 2.8%. Perhaps Christmas wasn\u2019t as bad as feared.... There is relief in Shanghai as the China\u2019s stock market closes up today. The Shanghai composite ended the day 0.7% higher at 3,215 points, meaning it is \u2018only\u2019 down 13.8% so far this year. Investors welcomed the news that Beijing had stepped up its support for the yuan today. As mentioned in the introduction, China\u2019s central bank intervened aggressively in the offshore currency markets today, boosting the renminbi and sparking a record surge in the city\u2019s money-market rates. That might scare off speculators who had been been betting against the yuan. OPEC members who don\u2019t like the look of $30 per barrel oil should take a deep breath -- analysts at Standard Chartered think prices could hit $10(!) a barrel. The bank argue that the strength of the US dollar, and pessimism in the stock market, could send oil down to levels not seen since 1999. \u201cGiven that no fundamental relationship is currently driving the oil market towards any equilibrium, prices are being moved almost entirely by financial flows caused by fluctuations in other asset prices, including the US dollar and equity markets. \u201cWe think prices could fall as low as $10/bbl before most of the money managers in the market conceded that matters had gone too far.\u201d The slump in the oil price could prompt the OPEC cartel into an emergency meeting, according to Nigeria\u2019s energy minister. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, Nigeria\u2019s minister of state for petroleum resources, told reporters at a conference in Abu Dhabi that a couple of OPEC members have already suggested a meeting. This would give an opportunity for OPEC members to cut production rates, something they\u2019ve declined to do at their scheduled meetings. OPEC\u2019s strategy appeared to be keen to flood the market with crude, drive prices down, put rival suppliers such as shale out of business, and pick up the pieces later. The speed of the slump in prices over the last 18 months may prompt a rethink, though.. Oil is coming under renewed pressure today, as traders speculate about just how low the crude price will fall. Crude prices tumbled by another 3% today, hitting fresh 12 year lows. It is being driven down by concerns over the world economy\u2019s weakness which is fuelling the oversupply glut. Brent, sourced from the North Sea, hit a low of $30.43 per barrel in early trading, before struggling back to $30.80 As we warned yesterday, Morgan Stanley analysts believe oil could hit $20 this year -- and at this rate, it might happen sooner than crude producers would like. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like another day dominated by two familiar themes - China, and oil. Overnight, Beijing has managed to strengthen the yuan, seemingly throwing the monetary kitchen sink at its currency to prevent another devaluation. As we explain here: \u201cThe market suspects that the People\u2019s Bank of China is possibly using major state banks to directly drain yuan liquidity in offshore markets,\u201d said a dealer at an European bank in Shanghai. The dealer described the strength of the central bank\u2019s actions as being of \u201cnuclear-weapon\u201d level strength. \u201cIts actions are comparable to steps taken by other central banks when they previously fought against international speculators, such as George Soros,\u201d he said. That means European markets are likely to be calm this morning: On the UK front, we find out how Britain\u2019s industrial sector fared in December, at 9.30am GMT. And Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a speech in Paris this afternoon , at 2.15pm GMT. Hopefully he might touch on the turmoil that has gripped the world markets this year. And there\u2019s a flood of UK company news, particularly on the retail front. Struggling supermarket group Morrisons, high street chain Debenhams, and pasty-purveyer Greggs are all updating the City. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BP is cutting one in five jobs at its North Sea operations as the oil price threatens to fall below $30 a barrel. The British oil and gas group is laying off 600 people in Scotland in a cost-cutting drive that will involve 4,000 employees axed worldwide. The redundancies are taking place against the backdrop of a slumping oil price, which has hit industry profits and forced producers to shelve projects around the world worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The North Sea cuts will affect oil rig workers as well as office-based staff and agency workers on long-term contracts, but there are no plans to close any oil rigs, BP said. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said: \u201cThis is a very difficult time indeed for people working in the North Sea.\u201d She said the Scottish government\u2019s North Sea jobs taskforce, established a year ago after the first wave of industry cuts, would offer support to the workers affected. The Unite trade union said the crisis gripping the British oil and gas sector was \u201cfar from over\u201d. Unite\u2019s regional officer, John Boland, said: \u201cIt is deeply worrying that we are now seeing a super-major making deep cuts to its workforce across the UK. We need an emergency convention of all the industry stakeholders \u2013 government, employers and trade unions \u2013 to tackle this crisis so we have a safe and sustainable industry for the next generation.\u201d BP has a 3,000-strong workforce in Scotland and the lay-offs will take place over two years, with the majority of job losses to come this year. Oil prices have been hit by a combination of falling global demand in the wake of China\u2019s economic slowdown; oversupply caused by the oil cartel Opec\u2019s refusal to cut output and robust US shale production; and the strong US dollar. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has fallen to nearly $30 a barrel from $100 a barrel in mid-2014, and is close to levels seen in 2003. On Tuesday evening a barrel of Brent Crude was trading at $30.55, which is half the level required by major oil groups such as Total and BP in order to balance their books. On Tuesday West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI), a US benchmark, touched a low of $29.93, which was last seen in December 2003, before settling at $30.44 a barrel. Morgan Stanley, one of Wall Street\u2019s leading investment banks, predicts oil prices could tumble to $20 a barrel in coming months, while economists at Royal Bank of Scotland warned on Tuesday that oil could slump to $16 a barrel. Sturgeon admitted that oil prices \u2013 now at a third of the $100 a barrel price forecast by her government in the Scottish independence referendum \u2013 could yet fall further. However, she refused to say that the sector was in crisis, noting that BP and Oil &amp; Gas UK, the industry body, had both stressed North Sea oil had a bright future and were planning continued investment. However, Sturgeon conceded that while lower oil prices helped consumers and the wider economy through cheaper fuel costs, the job losses and cuts in oil industry spending were having a direct, negative impact on economic output. \u201cIt is undoubtedly the case that there will be a wider impact,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will look carefully at unemployment figures and at GDP figures. [Again] while I\u2019m not trying to underplay the significance of the North Sea, a lower oil price has other impacts on the wider economy in terms of lower fuel costs.\u201d BP\u2019s cutbacks form part of a major reduction in the energy giant\u2019s global \u201cupstream\u201d workforce \u2013 those who work in oil exploration and production \u2013 from 24,000 to less than 20,000 by December 2017. Its job reductions came a day after oil and gas services firm Petrofac warnedit would cut up to 160 jobs in the UK as part of business restructuring. BP said it remained committed to the North Sea, and is investing $4bn in North Sea oil and gas, including the new Clair Ridge project and the redevelopment of the Schiehallion and Loyal fields, west of the Shetland Islands. Mark Thomas, regional president for BP North Sea, told a public meeting in Aberdeen: \u201cThis will sustain many hundreds of jobs both in BP North Sea and our supply chain going forward. However, in toughening market conditions and given the well-documented challenges of operating in this maturing region, we need to take specific steps to ensure our business remains competitive and robust. \u201cAn inevitable outcome of this will be an impact on headcount and we expect a reduction of around 600 staff and agency contractor roles by the end of 2017, with the majority of these taking place this year.\u201d BP now employs 80,000 people worldwide. Following a separate announcement of 4,000 job losses across all its operations last year, the latest cutbacks mean it is reducing its workforce by 10% over three years.",

European shares also moved higher and Wall Street was in positive territory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up around 42 points, by the time London closed. But Chinese trade figures due in the early hours of the morning could provoke more volatility on Wednesday.

      "bodyText": "The former head of the British Bankers\u2019 Association has repeatedly told MPs she was sorry that she ended up at the lobby group at the time of banking crisis and the Libor rigging scandal. Angela Knight, the former Conservative MP who ran the BBA between 2007 and 2012, faced questions on Tuesday from the Treasury select committee about whether her tenure at the association was a credibility issue for her. She disagreed. MPs on the committee were taking evidence about her appointment as chair of the Office of Tax Simplification after a two-year stint at Energy UK. \u201cI found myself in charge [at the BBA] at the time of the biggest banking crisis in history. I did what I could in the face of a hurricane,\u201d she said. \u201cIf someone who does a difficult job and finds themselves in a very tricky position does what they can, is thereafter told, \u2018You can\u2019t do anything else,\u2019 you\u2019ll never get anybody to do a difficult job again. I tried my best. \u201cI am so sorry I ended up at the BBA during the banking crisis. I\u2019m so sorry it chose me to be its target. I\u2019m so sorry it took a trade association into a different era. I\u2019m so sorry I never persuaded the authorities to take over [setting] Libor [rates] earlier and I\u2019m so sorry the banks brought about [the] financial disaster they did.\u201d Knight admitted that she wished she had been stronger in dealing with the problems that were uncovered with Libor, the regime for inter-bank interest rates, which at the time the BBA administered. Knight had wanted the Bank of England to have observer status over Libor. She also said she had disagreed with the judicial challenge mounted by the banking industry over compensation for the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal. The challenge was brought to a sudden halt shortly after Lloyds Banking Group started paying out compensation in May 2011. The mis-selling scandal has proved to be the most expensive in history, incurring fines and costs of \u00a326bn and rising. Knight said she had wanted to resign over the PPI situation, but was asked to stay longer. She was prepared to quit her new role if there was political inference, she told the MPs. During the financial crisis \u2013 which erupted within months of her taking charge at the BBA \u2013 Knight was regularly forced to defend the banking industry. She gave more than 800 broadcast interviews and made over 1,000 speeches. The Treasury committee said it would publish a report following Knight\u2019s appearance. \u201cA report on the committee\u2019s consideration of her personal independence and professional competence in the context of this role will be published in due course,\u201d it said. Knight told the committee she had been encouraged to apply for the two-day-a-month role at the tax body as it was an organisation interested in promoting women into senior positions. \u201cThe OTS is not an organisation that decides on tax,\u201d she told the committee, adding that it was not set up to tackle tax avoidance and evasion. Last month, research by Reuters found that five major banks had not paid any corporation tax in 2014 in their UK arms. Other multinationals have also been found not to paying as much tax as might be expected. Knight was asked to look at whether the OTS had a role to play in tackling this area, and said she was appalled at stories about avoidance.",

Other multinationals have also been found not to paying as much tax as might be expected. Knight was asked to look at whether the OTS had a role to play in tackling this area, and said she was appalled at stories about avoidance.</p>",

Such is the advice John Maynard Keynes is supposed to have given to would-be investors looking to make a killing in the period between the first and second world wars. There is some dispute about whether Keynes ever delivered this warning. What is not at issue is that it was advice he did not always follow, especially when it came to his dabblings in the currency market. A new study of Keynes\u2019s attempts to make money out of movements in the pound against five major currencies of his day \u2013 the dollar, French franc, German mark, Italian lire and Dutch guilder \u2013 comes to a stark conclusion. He was a great economist but decidedly average foreign exchange dealer. The study found that Keynes \u201cexperienced periods of considerable losses in both the 1920s and 1930s. Indeed, he was close to being technically bankrupt in 1920 and could only stay trading thanks to his ability to borrow funds from his social circle.\u201d He was an avid speculator, playing the stock, property, commodity and currency markets. Details of more than 350 of his currency trades between 1919 and 1939 were kept in the archives of King\u2019s College Cambridge, where Keynes managed the endowment fund. Two academics who have studied the trades \u2013 Olivier Accominotti of the London School of Economics and David Chambers of Cambridge\u2019s Judge Business School \u2013 say Keynes was much better at picking shares than he was at currency dealings, and that his chequered record might make today\u2019s testosterone-driven traders think twice. \u201cUnlike his stock investing, Keynes found the currency market a lot tougher, despite the fact that he was at the centre of the world of international finance throughout the time he traded currencies,\u201d Chambers said. Overall, Keynes made rather than lost money on currency speculation in the 1920s and 1930s, and the authors of the study say the profits were based on more than pure chance. \u201cDirectionally, he called currencies more or less correctly but he really struggled with timing his trades\u201d, Chambers said. \u201cHence, one main message for investors today is that if someone as economically literate and well connected as Keynes found it difficult to time currencies, then the rest of us should think twice before believing we can do any better.\u201d Keynes based his investment strategy on his assessment of the fundamentals of an economy, including the likely trends for growth, inflation, the balance of payments, capital flows and political developments. Other currency dealers, however, follow different approaches. Some bet on currencies that offer higher interest rate yields over those that offer lower interest \u2013 the so-called carry trade \u2013 while some simply go with momentum, backing those currencies that have recently been rising. The research paper, If You\u2019re So Smart: John Maynard Keynes and currency speculation in the interwar years, says the era when Keynes was playing the currency markets was marked by large deviations of exchange rates from their fundamental values. \u201cImplementing a currency trading strategy based on the analysis of macroeconomic fundamentals was challenging [even] for John Maynard Keynes.\u201d Keynes had a particularly tough time in the 1920s, a period when the pound returned to the gold standard at its pre-first world war level. The paper says currency traders can be judged by the returns generated per unit of risk, which is known as the Sharpe ratio. In the 1920s, Keynes could boast a Sharpe ratio of approximately 0.2, but those traders using a blend of the carry trade and momentum strategies scored higher at closer to 1.0 after transaction costs. Perhaps chastened by the experience, Keynes took a five-year break from currency trading and when he resumed his speculative activities in 1932 he did better. He outperformed the carry trade strategy but still did worse than an approach based on momentum.",

      "bodyText": "Direct Line, one of Britain\u2019s biggest insurers, will take a hit of up to \u00a3140m from the three storms that flooded parts of Britain in recent weeks. The company put the total cost of clients\u2019 claims in its home and commercial divisions at between \u00a3110m and \u00a3140m. This was less than analysts had feared, and the company\u2019s shares rose 2% to 369.6p. The news came as experts at PricewaterhouseCoopers warned that households caught up in the recent flooding could see their insurance premiums rise by up to 15% \u2013 while others who have been flooded in the past but not this winter could see their premiums fall thanks to the new Flood Re scheme. Direct Line expects home claims from Storms Desmond, Eva and Frank to total \u00a380-100m, exceeding the normal annual level of severe weather-related claims of \u00a380m. Claims in its commercial unit are estimated at \u00a330-\u00a340m. The storms battered large parts of the north including Cumbria, Yorkshire and southern Scotland, and left many people homeless or without power. The company, which sent out almost 200 claims advisers and adjustors, said about 90% of the first damage assessment visits had been completed and all customers whose homes had become uninhabitable had been placed in alternative accommodation. Fellow home insurers Aviva and RSA have yet to reveal their estimates of the flood claims. Britain\u2019s insurers will foot a total bill of about \u00a31.3bn to cover damage caused by the floods \u2013 less than half the \u00a33bn bill racked up after the 2007 floods, according to the Association of British Insurers. The average payout for domestic claims is \u00a350,000. The total cost of the winter floods is likely to top \u00a35bn, and those without insurance or with inadequate cover will foot about a fifth of the bill, accountants KPMG have estimated. PricewaterhouseCoopers said the impact on home insurance premiums will be mixed. The renewal date will be crucial, as the government-backed Flood Re scheme, which guarantees affordable insurance for households in areas at risk of flooding, comes into effect in April. Mohammad Khan, UK general insurance leader at PwC, explained: \u201cFor those affected by the floods, their premium rate is likely to depend on when their policy is due for renewal. If it\u2019s due for renewal before Flood Re starts operating in April this year then it is likely that their insurance premiums will increase (although they are likely to fall again when they renew the following year, when they will be eligible under the Flood Re scheme).\u201d He added that if a homeowner\u2019s premium was due for renewal after April and their home had been flooded regularly over the last few years but not recently, their home insurance premium was likely to fall by 1-5% due to Flood Re \u2013 and some people could save thousands of pounds if they shopped around. However, those whose homes have been flooded for the first time this winter \u2013 such as certain areas of Scotland and Wales \u2013 could see their premiums rise by up to 15%. Without Flood Re, their premiums would be going up much more.",

      "bodyText": "Airbus has claimed to have edged ahead in its battle with rival Boeing last year as it won orders for more than 1,000 new planes, although Boeing made and delivered more aircraft. The aircraft manufacturer said it now had 57% of the market overall by units ordered, with the 1,036 orders in 2015 making its cumulative order book total more than $1tn (\u00a3693bn), securing production for a decade to come. Airbus said its improved, fuel-efficient A320neo family of planes was securing it a dominant position in the single-aisle market for smaller short-haul aircraft. The first such plane will be delivered this month, but 861 are on order, comfortably outselling Boeing\u2019s competitor, the 737 MAX. However, its US rival is selling more widebody planes \u2013 and delivering more aircraft overall. Boeing delivered 762 planes in 2015 for revenues of $125.bn compared with Airbus\u2019s 635 aircraft, earning $91.6bn. Airbus\u2019s sales boss, chief operating officer John Leahy, said Boeing achieved higher deliveries because it had \u201cseveral years\u2019 headstart on ramping up its 787 programme\u201d while Airbus\u2019s widebody equivalent, the A350, delivered its first planes about a year ago. Both manufacturers recorded a substantial drop in orders last year as demand slowed in the aviation market after a short boom. Leahy said the aircraft leasing market was financing an increasing proportion of Airbus orders, with lessors now sometimes buying out production slots from airlines and lending back the planes to make the acquisitions viable. Airbus announced a sliver of good news on its totemic superjumbo, the A380, which was once seen as a crucial development for congested airports, but has been said by some \u2013 not least rivals Boeing \u2013 to be in danger of becoming a white elephant. Airbus said the plane broke even financially last year, with 27 A380s delivered \u2013 it also took an order for three aircraft from a new, unnamed global airline. Leahy said more new customers would be announced this year and insisted the A380 had a future, saying passenger numbers would double by 2030: \u201cHow are we going to get into Heathrow or JFK without larger aircraft?\u201d The delivery figure of 635 planes last year was a record high for Airbus, with 491 A320 family, 103 A330s and 14 A350s making up the rest of the total.",

Leahy said more new customers would be announced this year and insisted the A380 had a future, saying passenger numbers would double by 2030: \u201cHow are we going to get into Heathrow or JFK without larger aircraft?\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.airbus.com/newsevents/news-events-single/detail/airbus-exceeds-targets-in-2015-delivers-the-most-aircraft-ever/\">delivery figure of 635 planes</a> last year was a record high for Airbus, with 491 A320 family, 103 A330s and 14 A350s making up the rest of the total.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Morrisons announces store closures despite Christmas sales rise", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Morrisons is to close seven stores with the potential loss of nearly 700 jobs despite achieving a surprise increase in sales over Christmas. Shares in the company soared nearly 9% to 165.5p as it revealed a better-than-expected 0.2% rise in sales at established stores in the nine weeks to 3 January, its first positive figure for four years. City analysts had expected like-for-like sales, which exclude the contribution from new stores or losses from store closures, to fall 2%. The better-than-expected performance from Morrisons also lifted shares in other supermarkets, with Sainsbury\u2019s, which reports its Christmas trading figures on Wednesday, up just over 3% to 251p and Tesco up nearly 9% to 155p. Morrisons said customers were starting to return to its stores with like-for-like transactions up 1.3% in its core supermarkets during the period. The chain has been hit by competition from the German discounters Aldi and Lidl and has cut prices to compete. The retailer also got a big boost from the internet with online sales double that for Christmas 2014. That contributed 0.9 percentage points to the like-for-like figure, offsetting a fall in sales at Morrisons\u2019 supermarkets. David Potts, Morrisons\u2019 chief executive, said the contribution of online sales growth was less important than earlier in the year and the big improvement in Christmas performance was all about stores. \u201cWhile there is of course much more to do, we are making important progress in improving all aspects of the shopping trip, and our customers tell us they are pleased with the changes,\u201d he said. A rejig of the chain\u2019s alcohol department including the introduction of deals on cases of wine during the Black Friday discount week made it the \u201cstandout department\u201d,Potts said. However, a 25% uplift in sales of its Nutmeg clothing range, which it now plans to put in all stores, and improvements on its premium Signature range as well as fish, meat, fruit and vegetables all contributed to the dramatic step up in performance over Christmas. Morrisons reported a 2.6% slide in like-for-like sales in the three months to 1 November. Potts said seven medium-sized supermarkets would be closed since they were unprofitable and he could not find a way to sufficiently improve performance. The company is consulting with 680 staff over potential redundancy. The latest closures come on top of 21 supermarkets shut last year and the sale of its 140 convenience stores. Potts said the strong performance over Christmas was important but there was still further to go to turn Morrisons around. \u201cI\u2019m pleased with the performance over Christmas but Christmas is just one trading period and we go on from there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis turnaround will not be in a straight line as we continue to learn about the business and how we might improve it. Every week in retail is a battle.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are the small guy in the squeezed middle, the British underdog.\u201d Potts said Morrisons was prepared to invest more in cutting prices as that was important to its shoppers alongside making baked goods and other foods in-house. Morrisons is the first of Britain\u2019s big four supermarkets to report sales figures for the vital festive period amid fierce competition and falling prices. Clive Black at Morrisons in-house broker Shore Capital said: \u201cWe feel that an improvement in trade from Morrisons may lead to a reassessment of the view that this is a sub-scale business than cannot compete with seemingly bigger fish.\u201d Duygu Hardman, analyst at Verdict Retail, said it was too early to be sure of a turnaround at Morrisons as the Christmas trading figures were set against a very weak sales period last year. \u201cMorrisons\u2019 attempts to simplify its positioning, both around clearer pricing and a more considered store presence around its mid-sized heritage supermarket format were key to an improvement in performance over the crucial festive period. However, it is too early to call this a recovery,\u201d Hardman said.",

Revenues rose 12.3% last year, helped by Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the final Hunger Games film and Spectre, the company said. It opened 18 new cinemas in 2015, with 13 scheduled for this year, and continued to increase the number of Starbucks outlets at its sites. But it said it expected profits to be \u201cin line with current market expectations\u201d when some analysts had been hoping for an increase in forecasts. It also decided not to show Quentin Tarantino\u2019s western The Hateful Eight. And despite the group pointing to what it calls \u201can attractive film slate for 2016\u201d including Fantastic Beats and Where to Find Them, Star Wars: Rogue One, Finding Dory and Captain America: Civil War, analysts are not convinced, and Cineworld\u2019s shares have dropped 16.5p to 521p. Nick Batram at Peel Hunt cut his recommendation from buy to add and said: 2015 is a good result for Cineworld but we had hoped it could be even better. In terms of box office, 2015 will be a hard year to beat. Nevertheless, the film schedule does look better than average, the investment in IMAX/4DX/Starbucks should provide a further boost as should the growth in Unlimited. These elements together with the expansion in the estate should see Cineworld deliver further growth in 2016. However, as mentioned we had hoped for a beat in 2015 and fewer new openings is also slightly disappointing. We remain long-term positive but it in the short-term the shares might find it difficult to outperform. Canaccord repeated its sell rating, saying: Cineworld is better at building cinemas in unsophisticated East Europe where competition is weak, than optmizing performance from its sophisticated UK portfolio where competition is intense. Investec was more positive, with analyst Steve Liechti saying in a buy note: The full year pre-close suggests Star Wars performed well with profit expected as we forecast. While low end consensus could increase and we have already upgraded by 8% in 2015, this may disappoint the bulls. However, we put a low PE on now historic 2015 upgrades as 2016 must deliver with no mega blockbusters despite a decent overall slate. The investment case is driven by strong management running a good UK business better (with margin upside), a good new UK opening pipeline, and East Europe mid-term growth.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Greggs have fallen sharply after the bakery chain suffered a slowdown in sales during the Christmas period. Greggs said sales in established shops rose by 2.3% year-on-year in the final quarter of the year, but this compares with growth of 5.6% in the rest of the year. The company said the slowdown was due to a strong performance in the same period the previous year and a drop in visitor numbers to the high street. Greggs is the latest company to warn of falling footfall on the high street in the run-up to Christmas, with clothing retailers particularly hit. Shares in Greggs fell by 8% following the trading update. The company\u2019s share price surged by almost 80% in 2015 as the bakery chain fought back against the expansion of sandwich chains and coffee shops such as Pret a Manger and Costa Coffee. Greggs has been revitalised in the last year under boss Roger Whiteside, who has broadened the company\u2019s range of products, improved its coffee and introduced healthier options. The company now operates 1,698 outlets after opening 122 new shops and closing 74 in the last year. It also refurbished 202 shops in 2015. Despite the slowdown in sales, Whiteside said that profits for the year would still be in line with expectations. Analysts at Shore Capital have forecast that Greggs will post annual pre-tax profits of \u00a372.6m, up from \u00a358.3m last year. Whiteside said: \u201c2015 saw us deliver another excellent year of progress as we continue to transform Greggs into a modern, well-invested food-on-the-go retailer. \u201cSales growth has been particularly strong in sandwiches and drinks, including our healthier options \u2018balanced choice\u2019 range including new salads and \u2018no added sugar\u2019 drinks. Our new hot food menu, with an improved hot sandwich range and fresh soups, is also selling well as customers become increasingly aware of our new food-on-the-go options.\u201d Darren Shirley, analyst at Shore Capital, added: \u201cGreggs is a strong operator in the fast-growing UK \u2018food to go\u2019 market, and we expect a further year of growth in 2016, however a very strong 2015 when the stock price appreciated over 70% we expect a more sedate stock price performance in 2016.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK's industrial sector ends 2015 on a low note", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound has tumbled to its lowest against the dollar since June 2010 as investors reacted to an unexpected and broad-based downturn in Britain\u2019s industrial sector that hit factory output, mining and energy production. Sterling dropped below $1.44 on Tuesday and was also down more than 1 cent against the euro, continuing a long slide since last summer when the value of the pound stood at almost $1.60. Official figures showed that a slump in the pharmaceutical industry made the biggest contribution to manufacturing\u2019s worsening situation, leading to a decline of 0.4% in November 2015 from the previous month. Analysts said the disappointing figures, which follow a similar contraction in October, would set the tone for a difficult 2016 that could knock George Osborne\u2019s growth projections off course and delay an interest rate rise by the Bank of England until the end of the year. The chancellor is also likely to hear louder calls for the government to step in and support manufacturers which have seen exports suffer as China\u2019s economy slows and the eurozone struggles to gain momentum. Osborne warned last week that he feared the UK faced heightened risks from the shaky global economy, saying 2016 has opened with a \u201cdangerous cocktail of new threats\u201d. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said: \u201cUK industry looks to have once again failed to grow in the closing quarter of last year, ending a tough year for manufacturers and energy companies. \u201cClearly, the sector looks to have once again made no contribution to economic growth in the closing quarter of 2015, leaving the economy reliant on the services sector to sustain the upturn.\u201d Williamson said the weakness in part reflected the headwinds faced by North Sea oil producers as they adjust to lower prices and a drop in demand because of the unusually warm weather. Brent crude, which was trading at more than $110 (\u00a376) a barrel 20 months ago, dropped below $31 in midday trading on Tuesday. The Office for National Statistics said the largest contribution to the decrease in manufacturing came from \u201cbasic pharmaceutical products &amp; pharmaceutical preparations\u201d, which decreased by 4.9%. Mining fell 0.2%, while the production of crude oil and natural gas dropped by 0.23%. Overall, industrial production fell 0.7% from October to leave it only 0.9% higher than in November 2014. Over the same period, manufacturing output decreased by 1.2%. Last week a survey by the British Chambers of Commerce found that manufacturing fared worse than the services sector and was \u201cclose to stagnation\u201d after domestic and export sales fell to below their pre-recession levels in 2007. The BCC said that without government action to improve workers\u2019 skills, upgrade outdated infrastructure and allow small firms access to the same cheap credit available to large businesses, \u201cthe UK economy could suffer negative consequences in the face of increasing global uncertainty\u201d. Illustrating the difficult period faced by the manufacturing sector since the financial crisis, the ONS said that in the three months to November 2015, production and manufacturing were 9.1% and 6.1% respectively below their values reached in the pre-downturn GDP peak in the first quarter of 2008. Until recently the pharmaceutical sector had proved to be a bright spot after a lacklustre recovery in 2012 and 2013. Its recent decline leaves only the aerospace industry and car making as the engines of UK expansion across manufacturing.",

      "bodyText": "Supermarkets and housebuilders are leading the way as the UK market tries to break a four day losing streak. Better than expected growth from Morrisons has pushed its shares up 13.6p to 165.9p. Meanwhile Sainsbury, 6.7p better at 250p was lifted by news of a good performance over Christmas, according to Kantar Worldpanel figures. Tesco shares also rose, up 9.15p to 154.6p. Housebuilders made gains in the wake of Taylor Wimpey\u2019s update on Monday, as Jefferies issued a positive note. Analyst Anthony Codling said: We start the year with a high level of conviction that the price of the UK housebuilders shares will outperform the overall UK stock market during 2016. A structural shortage of supply coupled with a very pro-homeownership Government and rising wages, provides fertile ground for share price growth, in our view. Cash generation is also high and highly visible and, in our view, dividend streams also underpin valuations... We have sufficient confidence to increase our price targets by an average of 18%, we believe that scarcity of supply of homes, mortgages and potential bank rate rises will favour the Help to Buy assisted new build market and raise the prospects of upgrades during 2016. So Taylor Wimpey has added 3.7p to 198.6p, Barratt Development is 17p better at 611.5p and Berkeley Group is up 157p to \u00a336.95. Overall the FTSE 100 has added 63.08 points to 5934.91, despite weaker UK manufacturing figures. Investors have taken heart from China\u2019s aggressive move to shore up the yuan. Elsewhere British Airways owner International Airlines Group has climbed 17p to 606.5p amid the falling oil price, which should reduce its fuel costs. Barclays has also issued a positive note: We reiterate overweight on IAG, with target price 750p. Having raised its midcycle margin and cashflow targets at the November capital markets day, and paid its first dividend in December, IAG continues to make excellent progress towards sustainable profitability, with clear scope for further cost savings. In 2016, the company will receive a major boost from lower fuel and, with capex guidance recently lowered, we think special dividends could be within sight. Debenhams has jumped nearly 18% to 77.8p following a forecast-beating 1.9% rise in like for like sales in the 19 weeks to January 9. But recruitment firm Michael Page is down 36.2p to 410.4p after it reported a 0.5% fall in fourth quarter profits, with tough trading conditions in the UK and Asia. Rival Hays has fallen 6.8p to 123.1p. Greggs has dropped 97p to \u00a311.28 after it left its full year forecast unchanged after fourth quarter sales growth slowed to 2.3%. Canaccord Genuity said: Greggs\u2019 interim management statement revealed trading had been tough in the fourth quarter as business flagged after a strong October, and as a consequence, results should be in line with expectations. We are top-of-range, so we are trimming our earnings per share forecasts by 1% to 55.3p for 2015 and by 3% to 58.4p for 2016. We have shaved our target price by 25p [to \u00a313.25] to reflect the downgrades but we retain our buy recommendation, as we believe there\u2019s still plenty of momentum within the business. Looking forward, there is still plenty to do. Greggs is only in the second year of a five-year plan to transform itself from a high street retailer to a bakery food-on-the-go operator.",

Sales at the Walmart-owned chain slumped 3.5% in the 12 weeks to 3 January, according to the latest figures from analysis firm Kantar Worldpanel, reducing its share of the grocery market by 0.6 percentage points to 16.2%. Evidence of tough times for Asda come after boss Andy Clarke pledged to cut prices by \u00a3500m this year in a bid to win back shoppers. Tesco and Morrisons also lost share over Christmas, as Sainsbury\u2019s, Aldi, Lidl, the Co-op and Waitrose all attracted more shoppers in a tough market where prices were down nearly 2% compared with last year. Tesco was the second worst performer with sales down 2.7% according to Kantar, taking its share down 0.8 percentage points to 28.3%, while Morrisons\u2019 sales slid 2.6% as its share fell 0.3 percentage points to 11%. Both Tesco and Morrisons\u2019 sales figures were affected by store closures, while Asda has not shut any outlets. Morrisons on Tuesday revealed a surprise uplift in sales at established stores. Sainsbury\u2019s was the best performer of the big four supermarket chains, according to Kantar, as a 0.8% sales rise helped it cement its position as the UK\u2019s second largest supermarket, ahead of Asda, with a 17% share of the grocery market.

In a note to its clients the bank said: \u201cSell everything except high quality bonds. This is about return of capital, not return on capital. In a crowded hall, exit doors are small.\u201d It said the current situation was reminiscent of 2008, when the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank led to the global financial crisis. This time China could be the crisis point. Stock markets have already come under severe pressure in 2016, with the FTSE 100 down more than 5% in its worst start since 2000. In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average has made its poorest ever start to a year. Oil prices have also fallen sharply on fears of lower demand and a supply glut, especially with Iran due to start exporting once more when sanctions are lifted. Tensions between Iran and Saudia Arabia make it less likely that Opec can agree to cut production to halt the slide in prices. Brent crude is down another 1% at $31.18, its lowest level since April 2004. Investors have been spooked by fears of a severe slowdown in the Chinese economy and a fall in the value of the yuan, not helped by a crash in the country\u2019s stock market despite attempts by the country\u2019s authorities to curtail selling. Andrew Roberts, RBS\u2019s credit chief, said: \u201cChina has set off a major correction and it is going to snowball. Equities and credit have become very dangerous, and we have hardly even begun to retrace the \u2018Goldilocks love-in\u2019 of the last two years.\u201d Markets have been supported for some time by low interest rates, stimulus measures from central banks including quantitative easing, and hopes of economic recovery. But with the Federal Reserve raising rates and the Bank of England expected to follow suit, that prop is being removed. Roberts said European and US markets could fall by 10% to 20%, with the FTSE 100 particularly at risk due to the predominance of commodity companies in the UK index. \u201cLondon is vulnerable to a negative shock. All these people who are long [buyers of] oil and mining companies thinking that the dividends are safe are going to discover that they\u2019re not at all safe. \u201cWe suspect 2016 will be characterised by more focus on how the exiting occurs of positions in the three main asset classes that benefited from quantitative easing: 1) emerging markets, 2) credit, 3) equities \u2026 Risks are high.\u201d RBS is not the only negative voice at the moment. Analysts at JP Morgan have advised clients to sell stocks on any bounce. Morgan Stanley has said oil could fall to $20 a barrel, while Standard Chartered has predicted an even bigger slide, to as low as $10. Standard said: \u201cGiven that no fundamental relationship is currently driving the oil market towards any equilibrium, prices are being moved almost entirely by financial flows caused by fluctuations in other asset prices, including the US dollar and equity markets. \u201cWe think prices could fall as low as $10 a barrel before most of the money managers in the market conceded that matters had gone too far.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Debenhams\u2019 Christmas sales beat expectations as the department store chain relied less on discounts and cut stocks of coats and outerwear to take account of warmer winter weather. Clothing retailers such as Next have blamed the warmest December on record for disappointing sales of winter clothes but Debenhams said it deliberately stocked fewer coats and winter jumpers after it was affected by unusually warm weather the previous Christmas. As a result, Debenhams had less stock left over after Christmas than a year earlier. Michael Sharp, Debenhams\u2019 chief executive, said: \u201cFor the last couple of years we have embarked on a strategy of planning prudently. It\u2019s quite obvious for everybody to see that over the last few years the weather has been somewhat unseasonal. We have learnt the lessons \u2026 and that has made us resilient to unseasonably warm weather.\u201d Sales at stores open a year or more rose 1.9% in the 19 weeks to 9 January, compared with analysts\u2019 forecasts of a rise of just 0.3%. Excluding currency fluctuations, like-for-like sales rose 3.5%. Debenhams\u2019 shares rose as much as 17% and were up 14% to 75p at 930am. Top-selling items included lingerie, finer gauge knitwear and gifts such as perfume and makeup. Debenhams sold more than half a million handbags in November and December with J by Jasper Conran bags in high demand. The group had record toy sales over Christmas and sold more than 25,000 toy drones as stores rang up sales of 200 gifts a minute. Debenhams has been trying to reduce its reliance on promotions after it was blamed for pulling down prices across the sector two years ago. Full price sales rose 5% in the 19-week period as the chain limited the number and size of discounts before Christmas and offered more competitive full prices. Debenhams\u2019 surprisingly strong performance stood out over Christmas as overall UK retail spending had its weakest quarterly growth for more than a year as stores competed to lure customers. Sharp announced in October that he would leave Debenhams this year after shareholders agitated for a change of leadership following a string of disappointing results and profit warnings. He said Christmas sales showed his revamped strategy was working. \u201cThis is a strong performance. There\u2019s no doubt about that. The results are clear evidence that customers are liking what we are doing. This is not a one-off,\u201d he said. Debenhams has opened discreetly branded Sports Direct concessions in eight of its stores after Sports Direct\u2019s billionaire founder Mike Ashley bought a stake in the group. Sports Direct issued a profit warning last week, blaming tough trading and warm weather for disappointing sales. Sharp said he wanted Debenhams to increase sales of sportswear and shoes and that Debenhams planned to double the number of Sports Direct concessions to 16 by August. He declined to comment on the furore caused by the Guardian\u2019s investigation into Sports Direct\u2019s employment practices.",

      "bodyText": "The Chinese authorities have resorted to \u201cnuclear strength\u201d weapons to deter an attack on the yuan by short sellers and convince sceptical investors that they are in control of the country\u2019s spluttering financial system. China\u2019s central bank fixed the currency firmer again on Tuesday but traders were not persuaded and the currency slipped in early trade despite what dealers called aggressive intervention to support the currency. The gap between the mainland yuan and its offshore counterpart had grown in recent days but suspected intervention by China\u2019s state-owned banks brought them almost into line on Tuesday. The action sent the rate at which banks charge each other to borrow yuan in Hong Kong to a record high of 67% on Tuesday. \u201cThe market suspects that the People\u2019s Bank of China is possibly using major state banks to directly drain yuan liquidity in offshore markets,\u201d said a dealer at an European bank in Shanghai. The dealer described the strength of the central bank\u2019s actions as being of \u201cnuclear-weapon\u201d level strength. \u201cIts actions are comparable to steps taken by other central banks when they previously fought against international speculators, such as George Soros,\u201d he said. Equity markets in China looked set to end in positive territory with the Shanghai Composite Index falling up 0.5% in afternoon trading and the CSI300 index up 1% . But other markets in the region continued to struggle with the Nikkei off 2.7% in late afternoon trading while the ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia closed down for the eighth session in a row. Oil prices, which have lost 20% already this year amid uncertainty about the Chinese economy, continued to slide on Tuesday. Brent crude fell 43c to $31.12 a barrel having earlier touched $31.08, their lowest since April 2004. US crude was trading at $30.98 per barrel, also down 43c. Signalling a desire for stabilisation, the People\u2019s Bank of China set the mid-point for the yuan at 6.5628, barely changed from the previous strong fix and higher than its late levels on Monday. Perceived mis-steps by China\u2019s authorities have stoked concerns in global markets that Beijing might be losing its grip on economic policy, just as the country looks set to post its slowest growth in 25 years. Amid suspicions by some in the market that China wants the yuan to devalue in order to boost its ailing exporters, sources suggested there were moves afoot for China\u2019s cabinet to take a bigger role in overseeing financial markets. The state council has set up a working group to prepare for upgrading the cabinet\u2019s financial department to bureau level, said a source close to the country\u2019s leadership. Officials were doing their best to talk up the currency which was trading up slightly at 6.5757 to the dollar at 4am GMT on Tuesday. The central bank\u2019s chief economist Ma Jun said on Monday that the bank planned to keep the yuan basically stable against a basket of currencies, and fluctuations against the US dollar would increase. Han Jun, deputy director of the office of the Chinese Communist party\u2019s leading group on financial and economic affairs, said a more substantial decline in the yuan was \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cimpossible\u201d. He was speaking at a briefing held at the Chinese consulate in New York, suggesting the authorities were broadening their verbal campaign to deter yuan sellers. Not all are convinced, however. Goldman Sachs on Monday sharply cut its forecast for the yuan for this year and next. \u201cWith export growth deeply in negative territory, and exports likely to remain weak in coming months, it is likely easier to reach a policy consensus to allow some depreciation,\u201d Goldman analysts wrote in a note. Morgan Stanley has also cut its forecast, predicting that the yuan could fall to 7.31 to the dollar by the end of 2017. \u201cWhile policymakers are still trying to maintain the trade-weighted (yuan) exchange rate in a stable range, we now anticipate that they will transition towards targeting a depreciation ... earlier than initially expected,\u201d the bank said. \u201cThis move will help policymakers to still cut interest rates to manage deflationary pressures, but will imply further depreciation of the yuan (against the dollar).\u201d Figures for China\u2019s December trade accounts are due on Wednesday and are expected to show further falls in both exports and imports. But on Tuesday, China\u2019s top planning agency said the economy likely grew by the government\u2019s target of around 7% in 2015 and added 13 million new jobs as it announced the approval of more large infrastructure projects to avert the risks of a sharper slowdown. China achieved its main economic targets in 2015, Li Pumin, spokesman for the national reform and development commission (NDRC) told a news conference. Official fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 figures will be released next week and are expected to show GDP growth at around 7% but many experts believe the country\u2019s true growth is much weaker.",

Australia\u2019s increased growth is projected to be worse than 11 of the other 12 countries that signed the deal last year, according to the report on the global implications of the deal. Only the US fares worse. By 2030, Australia\u2019s gross domestic product could increase by just 0.7% as a result of the historic trade agreement. By contrast, Vietnam\u2019s GDP could rise by 10%, and Malaysia\u2019s by 8%, the World Bank finds. The analysis concedes that the impact for developed nations like Australia and the US will be \u201cmodest\u201d because \u201cexisting barriers to their trade ... are already low for the most traded commodities\u201d. \u201cIf ratified by all, the agreement could raise GDP in member countries by an average of 1.1% by 2030. It could also increase member countries\u2019 trade by 11% by 2030, and represent a boost to regional trade growth,\u201d the analysis said. The trade minister, Andrew Robb, has defended the agreement, which has been described as one of the largest and most diverse trade deals in history. \u201cThe historic Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement will deliver enormous benefits to Australia by enhancing our competitiveness, and promoting job creation, growth and higher living standards,\u201d a spokeswoman for Robb told Guardian Australia. \u201cAs well as slashing tariff barriers, it will drive Australia\u2019s integration in the fast-growing Asia Pacific, and improve access to regional value chains by establishing one set of trading rules across 12 countries. \u201cThe World Bank report demonstrates that all 12 TPP member countries \u2013 representing around 40% of global GDP \u2013 will experience economic growth and increased exports under the agreement.\u201d The Greens spokesman for trade, Peter Whish-Wilson, said the World Bank report was \u201cevidence that the highly politicised TPP agreement will not deliver anything like the government\u2019s overhyped spin\u201d. \u201cIts economic impact will be negligible,\u201d he said. \u201cThis latest World Bank analysis simply backs up all the evidence that has previously been presented regarding the lack of benefits to Australia. \u201cAndrew Robb has his head in the sand and no amount of credible evidence presented is going to shift him from his spin.\u201d Whish-Wilson argued the cost of controversial clauses which allowed multinational corporations to sue governments if they thought domestic laws harmed their investments had not been taken into account by the government. The government is \u201cin total denial about the future costs to Australia of Trojan horse investor-state dispute settlement provisions,\u201d Whish-Wilson said. Labor has vowed to examine the agreement. \u201cThe trans-Pacific partnership is a major agreement involving some of Australia\u2019s most important trading partners. Labor supports trade negotiations that promote growth and create jobs,\u201d Labor\u2019s acting spokesman on trade, Jim Chalmers, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe World Bank also notes that the agreement could be an important counterweight to the post-GFC global trade slowdown. Analysis by the World Bank and others will be considered by Labor as we consider the agreement.\u201d The 6,000-page deal was put online in October, but had previously been criticised for its secrecy. The wide-ranging deal includes changes to tariffs, drug patents and intellectual property. The 12 countries to sign the deal are: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, US and Vietnam. Global economic giant China was excluded from the deal, as was South Korea.",

    "webTitle": "Heavy discounting fails to draw Christmas high street sales", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was a Christmas to forget for most retailers after heavy discounting failed to attract consumers already out of breath from chasing bargains on Black Friday. Figures from the British Retail Consortium published on Tuesday reveal that the transformation of Britain\u2019s festive period from a two-week bonanza to a six-week slog, starting in November, meant that high street sales failed to soar as expected in December 2015. Like-for-like sales were just 0.1% higher than the previous December, dragged down by supermarket food sales, which slumped 1.1% year on year. The BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor found that online sales continued to attract an increasing number of shoppers, but the switch to home delivery of food and clothes failed to offset the lacklustre performance of high street shops. The figures lend credence to George Osborne\u2019s recent warning to consumers against complacency in the coming year as a \u201ccocktail of threats\u201d slows growth. But the BRC blamed the government in part for the slowdown, saying that rocketing business rates and the new national living wage were putting a squeeze on retailers. After new retail space was included, total food and drink sales crept back into the black for the first time since September, according to the figures, pushing total sales up 1%. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, described the Christmas period as a disappointing close to the year for retailers, who expected the \u201cunderlying momentum of an improving consumer environment buoyed by rising real incomes, low inflation and low unemployment\u201d to feed into higher sales growth. \u201cOnline performed strongly as consumers embraced the convenience and flexibility that more sophisticated retailers offered. Nevertheless, the boost from online was not enough to make this a Christmas to remember for most retailers,\u201d she said. A string of the best-known names on the high street have reported weak or lower sales over Christmas. Next was among many stores to blame warmer weather for a drop in sales of winter clothes. Marks &amp; Spencer boss Marc Bolland said he would stand down after a 6% fall in non-food items, though he said the poor Christmas results and his decision to quit were unrelated. John Lewis was one of the few shops to report an increase in sales, gaining credit from consumers for the ease of shopping online using their mobile phones. Britain\u2019s biggest supermarkets are expected to reveal a slide in Christmas sales later this week, as online-only operators steal their customers and discounters Aldi and Lidl grab a greater share of the market. Dickinson said the three-month rolling overall sales figure was the weakest for the entire year, with only 0.9% growth, while non-food saw its slowest performance since January 2013. Among the strongest performers were furniture stores and shops selling other home-related goods, supported by a robust housing market, renewed strength in mortgage approvals and a generally healthier appetite among consumers for credit, she added. Dickinson said: \u201cWith price deflation and offers aplenty, the current retail climate is great news for consumers. However, retailers are not benefiting from the improved economic climate in the same way that other sectors have done.\u201d Retail analysts Springboard gave a hint of the weak sales in advance of Christmas when it reported that the number of shoppers visiting UK stores slid 9% year on year on the Monday and Tuesday before Christmas day. David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, said the switch to buying electronic goods on Black Friday had made \u201ca significant impact on the shape of sales over the festive season, despite attempts by retailers to tame the demands of bargain-hunting consumers\u201d. Dickinson said retailers were struggling \u201cin part due to the rising cost of doing business, such as business rates and the national living wage due to be introduced in April\u201d. She added: \u201cThe government has a prime opportunity in March\u2019s budget to help UK retailers continue to drive growth in the economy and create new jobs by reducing the disproportionate burden of business rates and keep going with its structural review.\u201d Retail analysts IGD said the pendulum might swing back in favour of retailers as consumers become more confident. It said: \u201cPropensity to spend is increasing. A quarter of shoppers anticipate focusing more on quality this year when buying their groceries, compared with a fifth planning to put more emphasis on saving money. This is the first time since our survey began in September 2010 that the pendulum has swung in favour of quality.\u201d",

Like-for-like sales were just 0.1% higher than the previous December, dragged down by supermarket food sales, which slumped 1.1% year on year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/10/britains-biggest-supermarkets-to-reveal-falling-christmas-sales\">Britain's biggest supermarkets to reveal falling Christmas sales</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor found that online sales continued to attract an increasing number of shoppers, but the switch to home delivery of food and clothes failed to offset the lacklustre performance of high street shops.</p> <p>The figures lend credence to George Osborne\u2019s recent warning to consumers against complacency in the coming year as a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/07/george-osborne-warns-uk-economy-faces-cocktail-of-threats\">cocktail of threats</a>\u201d slows growth. But the BRC blamed the government in part for the slowdown, saying that rocketing business rates and the new national living wage were putting a squeeze on retailers.</p> <p>After new retail space was included, total food and drink sales crept back into the black for the first time since September, according to the figures, pushing total sales up 1%. <br></p> <p>Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, described the Christmas period as a disappointing close to the year for retailers, who expected the \u201cunderlying momentum of an improving consumer environment buoyed by rising real incomes, low inflation and low unemployment\u201d to feed into higher sales growth. \u201cOnline performed strongly as consumers embraced the convenience and flexibility that more sophisticated retailers offered. Nevertheless, the boost from online was not enough to make this a Christmas to remember for most retailers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A string of the best-known names on the high street have reported weak or lower sales over Christmas. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/05/next-reports-disappointing-christmas-after-mild-autumn\">Next</a> was among many stores to blame warmer weather for a drop in sales of winter clothes. Marks &amp; Spencer boss <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/07/ms-boss-marc-bolland-to-step-down\">Marc Bolland</a> said he would stand down after a 6% fall in non-food items, though he said the poor Christmas results and his decision to quit were unrelated. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/06/john-lewis-christmas-sales-boosted-by-online-shopping\">John Lewis</a> was one of the few shops to report an increase in sales, gaining credit from consumers for the ease of shopping online using their mobile phones.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s biggest supermarkets are expected to reveal a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/10/britains-biggest-supermarkets-to-reveal-falling-christmas-sales\">slide in Christmas sales</a> later this week, as online-only operators steal their customers and discounters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/aldi\">Aldi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lidl\">Lidl</a> grab a greater share of the market.<br></p> <p>Dickinson said the three-month rolling overall sales figure was the weakest for the entire year, with only 0.9% growth, while non-food saw its slowest performance since January 2013. Among the strongest performers were furniture stores and shops selling other home-related goods, supported by a robust housing market, renewed strength in mortgage approvals and a generally healthier appetite among consumers for credit, she added.</p> <p>Dickinson said: \u201cWith price deflation and offers aplenty, the current retail climate is great news for consumers. However, retailers are not benefiting from the improved economic climate in the same way that other sectors have done.\u201d</p> <p>Retail analysts Springboard gave a hint of the weak sales in advance of Christmas when it reported that the number of shoppers visiting UK stores <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/23/high-street-christmas-shopping-figures-make-grim-reading-for-retailers\">slid 9% year on year</a> on the Monday and Tuesday before Christmas day.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/11/lidl-mince-pies-out-of-stock\">All we wanted for Christmas was \u2026 a Lidl mince pie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, said the switch to buying electronic goods on Black Friday had made \u201ca significant impact on the shape of sales over the festive season, despite attempts by retailers to tame the demands of bargain-hunting consumers\u201d.</p> <p>Dickinson said retailers were struggling \u201cin part due to the rising cost of doing business, such as business rates and the national living wage due to be introduced in April\u201d. She added: \u201cThe government has a prime opportunity in March\u2019s budget to help UK retailers continue to drive growth in the economy and create new jobs by reducing the disproportionate burden of business rates and keep going with its structural review.\u201d<br></p> <p>Retail analysts IGD said the pendulum might swing back in favour of retailers as consumers become more confident. It said: \u201cPropensity to spend is increasing. A quarter of shoppers anticipate focusing more on quality this year when buying their groceries, compared with a fifth planning to put more emphasis on saving money. This is the first time since our survey began in September 2010 that the pendulum has swung in favour of quality.\u201d </p>",
