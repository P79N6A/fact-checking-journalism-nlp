      "bodyText": "Walmart employees are so poor that they are skipping lunch, sharing it or, in some cases, stealing it from their coworkers, some of the company\u2019s workers claimed on Thursday while announcing a fast in protest of the company\u2019s wages. Starting Friday morning, over 100 Walmart associates who are members of Our Walmart, a workers organization, and about a 1,000 supporters will begin a fast to shine light on what they describe as Walmart\u2019s \u201cpoverty pay\u201d. The protest comes in the run-up to Thanksgiving and the Black Friday shopping bonanza, one of Walmart\u2019s busiest periods. Some of the workers will take their fast to the doorstep of Walmart heiress Alice Walton\u2019s apartment in New York City. Earlier this year, Walmart announced it was raising wages for about half a million of its employees, paying them at least $9 an hour \u2013 $1.75 above the federally mandated minimum wage. The company plans to further increase their pay to $10 an hour next year. The workers say that\u2019s still not enough and demand that they be paid $15 an hour and be given full-time schedules. The name of the 15-day fast is Fast for 15. Tyfani Faulkner, a former Walmart customer service manager from Sacramento, California, who worked for company for about five years, will be one of those fasting in protest. \u201cEvery day there are associates who go to work with no lunch, or an unhealthy lunch, because that\u2019s all they can afford. I have seen instances where some would eat another associate\u2019s lunch from the refrigerator because they have nothing to eat,\u201d said Faulkner. \u201cOne of the things I remember most from working at Walmart was my friends and I emptying our pockets to scrape together one meal we all could share for lunch. One of my coworkers put in a dollar, another two dollars, and with my two, we could together buy chicken from Walmart\u2019s deli to split between us. That was lunch; I don\u2019t know if they had dinner.\u201d Denise Barlage, who worked at Walmart for nine years before being laid off during a store closing in Pico Rivera, California, said that break-room conversations at her store often focused on workers having to chose between paying for gas to get home or buying lunch. \u201cThese are decisions no one should have to make. There were times my own lunch was stolen, leaving me to think someone needed it more than me,\u201d she said. Speaking with reporters on Thursday, Faulkner called on Walmart to pay workers a living wage so that they could support themselves. \u201cWe need $15 an hour and full-time hours to provide for our families,\u201d said Jasmine Dixon, a Walmart associate and a mother of two boys from Denver, Colorado. \u201cI\u2019ve had to forego meals just so my boys would have enough to eat. Too many times, I have had to go to food banks just to try and scrape up some rice and beans for my kids to eat. If it weren\u2019t for food stamps and government programs for my kids, I don\u2019t know what I would do.\u201d In addition to asking Walmart for a $15 hourly wage and a better schedule, Nancy Reynolds, who works as a Walmart associate in Merritt Island, Florida, is petitioning for a 10% employee food discount at Walmart year round. \u201cI know other stores offer higher discounts for their employees and they don\u2019t make the money that Walmart makes,\u201d said Reynolds, who described herself as a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother who could not stand to see people go hungry. \u201cFalse attacks and media stunts from the unions have become an annual tradition this time of year,\u201d Walmart\u2019s spokesman told the Guardian. \u201cWalmart will continue to focus on our commitment to invest $2.7 billion over this year and next in wages, education and training for our associates. We\u2019re thankful for our associates and the millions of customers we\u2019ll serve this holiday season.\u201d All Walmart associates will be paid least $10 an hour by February 2016. The spokesman added: \u201cCurrently, department managers make around $13 per hour, and will receive an increase to at least $15 per hour next year.\u201d In response to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment, Walmart also pointed to a video featuring Noemi Flores, a manager at Walmart. \u201cBack in the 80s, it was really tough for me and my family. I was living on welfare, supporting a family of four. After I got the job at Walmart, things started to change immediately,\u201d Flores said in the video. \u201cThen I wrote a letter to the food stamp office: \u2018Thank you very much. I don\u2019t need your help anymore.\u2019\u201d Flores is among the 73% of Walmart\u2019s management team members who started as hourly paid employees. In the 20 years she has worked at Walmart, she managed to buy a house. Her son also works at Walmart now. Members of Our Walmart argue that not everyone working at Walmart has been able to make it on its wages, as Flores and other managers have. \u201cStories of hunger and food insecurity, of not having enough food to feed your kids are far too common with Walmart workers,\u201d said Andrea Dehlendorf, co-executive director of Our Walmart. \u201cThis Black Friday season, our Walmart workers have decided to share their stories of hunger, to make their private shame public.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron is being urged by UK steel employers and unions to join forces with world leaders at the G20 summit to warn the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to stop dumping cheap steel on Europe, or lose access to European markets. The call on Cameron to get tough comes in the wake of a mass of steel plant closures across Europe, the US and Mexico in part caused by China flooding markets with its own subsidised steel and so helping to drive down its global price. The European Union has some leverage over the Chinese since Xi is desperate to be given market economy status, a declaration that would open even more European markets to China. Much of the G20 summit in Antalya, southern Turkey, including the opening Sunday evening dinner, is likely to be taken up with a clash between the US and Russia over Syria, and world migration. But the G20 is the world leaders\u2019 premier economic forum, and Caroline Atkinson, Barack Obama\u2019s adviser on international economics and the chief US summit planner, has said one goal for the summit must be to boost world demand. China will host the G20 next year, and its role in boosting demand will be critical, but UK steel interests are hoping Cameron will make common cause with other EU nations to challenge China at this summit. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, formally wrote to Cameron asking him to raise the issue of steel dumping with the Chinese at the summit and to tell Xi that \u201cdumping underpriced Chinese steel on to the world market will significantly reduce UK support for China\u2019s ambition of achieving market economy status under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.\u201d The request has the support of UK Steel, the employers\u2019 body. China claims that under WTO rules it should be granted market economy status next year, a move that would make it harder still for the EU to impose retaliatory tariffs on cheap Chinese imports. O\u2019Grady points out in her letter to Cameron: \u201cThe mothballing and closing of plants in Motherwell, Redcar, Scunthorpe and the West Midlands in recent weeks threatens one in six of all UK steel jobs. The West Midlands Economic Forum has argued that in the Midlands alone these closures threaten a further 52,000 job losses in manufacturing over the next five years. But she adds: \u201cThe European steel industry has lost a fifth of its jobs since 2009, while demand remains 25% below levels before the 2007-08 financial crisis, as Europe has felt the force of Chinese steel, which is believed to be sold at below the cost of production. If that is correct, it is illegal under WTO rules, and I urge you to ensure that the Chinese president understands that there must be consequences. Market economy status would allow China to manipulate the price of even more goods, and undercut existing producers across the G20 economies.\u201d She told the Guardian: \u201cIf China is given market economy status without playing fair on steel prices, the crisis will go from bad to worse. \u201cThe government must now show that our growing relationship with China is not a one-way street. If you want to join the club, you have to play by the rules \u2013 so the prime minister must tell president Xi that if China continues to manipulate prices it will affect UK support for its MES bid.\u201d The initiative has been welcomed by the director of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, who told the Guardian: \u201cIt is appropriate for Cameron to raise this issue with the Chinese president at the G20. The Chinese actions are having a serious impact on steel-producing nations right across the world and there is very little evidence that they are complying with WTO rules.\u201d UK Steel believes the British are beginning to take a more proactive line to defend European steel from dumping, but fears that if China achieves market economy status as expected next year, the impact will be devastating. The first G20 summit was held in 2008 amid fears that a spreading financial crisis could trigger a worldwide depression, and there is growing concern of a further recession next year, with slowdowns in Russia, China and Brazil. The nations meeting in Turkey account for 85% of global output, and will be holding their discussions within 300 miles of the battleground of Syria. There are 2 million mainly Syrian refugees inside Turkey, and the recently re-elected Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, a fierce opponent of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, and the recent Russian military intervention, has been pushing for no-fly zones and safe havens within Syria. The US regarded the plan as impractical, but has been stung by the surprise Russian decision to use its air power to defend Assad. Russia has been pushing a rival eight-point peace plan that is silent on the future of Assad. Obama and his state secretary, John Kerry, are seeking regional agreement for elections inside Syria within 18 months leading to a new regime replacing Assad. The rival peace plans will be debated in Vienna on Saturday before the world leaders meet in Turkey to discuss progress. The G20 will also consider how Turkey can be helped further to stem the flow of refugees from its borders to Greece, and then further into the EU.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s march of the makers has stumbled after two of Britain\u2019s largest manufacturers announced hundreds of job losses and a downturn in their performance. Shares in Rolls-Royce lost a fifth of their value after the engineer issued its fourth profit warning in a year, and said 2,000 jobs were at risk. Arms maker BAE Systems, meanwhile, is to cut 371 jobs in the UK due to falling demand for the Typhoon fighter jet. Rolls and BAE are two of Britain\u2019s most famous companies, but are suffering from a slowdown in their key markets. Nick Cunningham, analyst at Agency Partners, warned Rolls faces \u201cexistential risks\u201d. The job cuts are the latest in a grim period for UK manufacturers, which have been affected by slower economic growth in China, the strong pound and other problems. More than 5,000 steel workers face losing their jobs, while more than 10% of the workforce of JCB are likely to be made redundant; Michelin is closing a factory in Northern Ireland with the loss of 860 jobs, and Jaguar Land Rover has embarked on a review of its operations that could lead to \u00a34.5bn of costs being cut. The Unite union warned BAE that cutting jobs too quickly could lead to skills shortages and called on the government to help the company win export orders. Unite\u2019s national officer, Ian Waddell, said: \u201cThis is disappointing news on top of a miserable few weeks for manufacturing in the UK. The government needs to stop dithering and act urgently to stop the haemorrhage of skilled UK manufacturing jobs. It is vital that critical skills and capability are maintained by BAE Systems and their supply chain so that the ability to build the Typhoon in the UK is protected.\u201d Rolls blamed its profit warning on falling demand for corporate jets in Brazil, China and south-east Asia, a decline in maintenance and servicing revenues from its engines for large planes and energy industry customers being affected by the slump in the oil price. Shares in Rolls fell 147.49p \u2013 or 22% \u2013 to 519.52p on the back of the stock market statement, their biggest one-day fall for 15 years. The slide in Rolls\u2019 performance could boost attempts by activist investor ValueAct to push for change at the company. California-based ValueAct has built up a 5.4% shareholding in Rolls and wants the engineer to sell off its marine business to focus on producing engines for passengers planes. ValueAct has asked for a seat on the Rolls board, but has been rejected by the company. Warren East, who replaced John Rishton as chief executive in July, is scheduled to unveil a new strategy for Rolls on 24 November. However, he gave a glimpse into the findings of his review by warning that Rolls needs to cut costs. East said: \u201cWhile 2015 remains broadly as expected, the outlook for 2016 is very challenging. The speed and magnitude of change in some of our markets, which have historically performed well, has been significant and shows how sensitive parts of our business are to market conditions in the short term. \u201cThe next few years are going to be important in laying the foundations for our long-term profitable growth. Therefore it is important to ensure we are financially stronger, more resilient to short-term shocks and more flexible to take advantage of growth opportunities.\u201d East wants to reduce costs by up to \u00a3200m a year at the same time as improving decision-making, so plans to streamline the number of senior managers. The company employs 2,000 senior managers around the world, but would not confirm how many jobs could go. The Rolls boss also warned that the company\u2019s dividend could be cut, which has not happened since 1992. Rolls, which makes engines for the Airbus A380 superjumbos, has been betting on wide-bodied aircraft and by 2020 half the world\u2019s jumbo jets will be powered by its engines. However, the trend among leading airlines is towards narrow-body passenger planes, a market that Rolls abandoned in 2013 when it pulled out of a joint venture with rival Pratt &amp; Whitney so it could focus on wide-bodied aircraft and the next generation of single-aisle planes that should follow the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max. In addition to the pressure in Rolls\u2019 traditional market, the company\u2019s marine unit, which accounts for half of its profits, is expected to make a loss in 2016 following a plunge in oil prices. The Derby-based group now expects profit \u201cheadwinds\u201d of \u00a3650m next year, more than double the \u00a3300m cut to profits identified in July. Analysts had already slashed their forecasts for underlying pre-tax profits to \u00a31.053bn before the latest downgrade. This means profits will be at least 30% below this forecast. Sandy Morris, analyst at Jefferies, said: \u201cSome bad news on profits has probably arrived today rather than over a period of years. \u201cWe believe Rolls-Royce will live to fight another day \u2013 24 November being a start. We believe the Rolls-Royce equity story is dented, but largely intact on a medium-term view.\u201d Meanwhile, BAE Systems will cut jobs in the UK and Australia as it slows production of the Typhoon fighter jet. Almost all the cuts will be at BAE\u2019s manufacturing operation at Samlesbury, Lancashire, with some at its assembly plant in Warton, also in Lancashire. The military air and information business employs about 13,000 people in the UK. In Australia, the company said that with no near-term prospect of work beyond existing ship orders, it would cut 150 jobs at its Williamstown shipyard in Melbourne and consolidate its operating divisions from three to two to reduce management costs. The slowdown in Typhoon production and a writedown on the value of the Williamstown shipyard will means BAE\u2019s profits are lower than expected. The company said its underlying earnings per share for 2015 will now be around 38p, flat compared to last year. However, shares in BAE rose 4% because the trading update was better than investors expected given the company\u2019s failure to agree a Typhoon deal with Saudi Arabia.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stock markets have tumbled on both sides of the Atlantic, after a slump in oil prices and uncertainty over the prospect for US interest rates triggered anxiety among financial traders. The FTSE 100 dived by almost 2% to 6178 by the close of trading on Thursday, while the New York Dow Jones was down more than 200 points at 17,492 as traders sought safe havens for investor funds. German and French stock markets were also hit by reports of an oil glut and huge surpluses of world stocks of platinum, lead and copper following the slowdown in China, the biggest user of base metals. Speeches by US central bank policymakers added to the concerns over the prospects for global growth after they appeared to confirm a rate rise next month, but hinted that further rises by the Federal Reserve may be delayed for months, or even years. Markets had appeared more confident in recent weeks following the turmoil in August and September, triggered by events in China, that sent shares into freefall and delayed an expected rise in rates by the Fed. The situation was stabilised after Beijing put together a stimulus package, while the European Central Bank (ECB) hinted that it planned to inject further funds into the eurozone economy to maintain recovery. However, with a US rate rise looming into view again, even another comment from the bank\u2019s boss Mario Draghi that he plans to go ahead with extra quantitative easing, possibly early next year, could not offset fears that global growth remains fragile and easily upset by higher borrowing costs in the US. Copper futures in London hit a six-year low of $4,851 (\u00a33,186) a tonne and platinum hit its lowest since late 2008 at $868.75 an ounce. Crude oil prices hit a two-and-a-half-month low, with Brent futures down $1.48, or 3.2%, at $44.3 a barrel. The dollar rallied against the euro and the pound after Draghi\u2019s dovish address to members of the European parliament. But the currency markets shifted after Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis president James Bullard, generally one of the Fed\u2019s more hawkish members, suggested industrial nations may be headed into an era of permanently low rates. \u201cShould we find ourselves in a persistent state of low nominal interest rates and low inflation, some of our fundamental assumptions about how US monetary policy works may have to be altered,\u201d said Bullard. But the Fed\u2019s New York president, William C Dudley, said a return to a path of rising interest rates was possible. \u201cI think it is quite possible that the conditions the [central bank\u2019s rate-setting] committee has established to begin to normalise monetary policy could soon be satisfied,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be evaluating the incoming information to see if it confirms my expectation that growth will be sufficient to further tighten the US labour market.\u201d Chicago Fed leader Charles Evans, a dovish member of the central bank\u2019s board, earlier stressed any increases should be \u201cgradual\u201d and that the base rate, currently 0.25%, could be less than 1% at the end of next year. In an address to the European parliament, Draghi said inflation remained weak and that a \u201csustained normalisation\u201d of inflation could take longer to achieve than thought. \u201cAlthough the debate at the ECB seems to be far from over, the fact that Draghi made these comments in a high-profile setting suggest that he is confident that the majority of the ECB council will support him,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London.",

      "bodyText": "The pressure on the chief executive of Volkswagen is growing after a leading investor in Germany called on Matthias M\u00fcller to step down less than two months after taking the helm at the scandal-hit carmaker. Union Investment, the third largest asset manager in Germany, said VW needed to appoint a chairman and chief executive from outside the company in order to recover from the diesel emissions scandal. M\u00fcller has worked for VW and the brands it owns for almost 40 years while Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, who was named chairman last month, was previously finance director for more than a decade. M\u00fcller was appointed chief executive in September. He replaced Martin Winterkorn, who resigned days after VW admitted it had installed defeat devices in 11m diesel vehicles that allowed the manufacturer to cheat emissions tests. The crisis has worsened since then, with M\u00fcller criticised for the lack of information about who was behind the scandal and the eventual cost to the company. The US Environmental Protection Agency has accused VW of also installing defeat devices into sports cars, including a Porsche model, which the company denies. Last week VW added a further aspect to the scandal by admitting it had found \u201cirregularities\u201d in the carbon dioxide levels emitted by 800,000 of its cars, including petrol models. Ingo Speich, a senior portfolio manager at Union Investment, told the Financial Times: \u201cIt would be far better to have new, fresh people in the management board and the supervisory board to gain back trust from the capital markets. It\u2019s all about trust. From the capital market\u2019s point of view the company is not communicating well and there is a lack of trust. \u201cWe are disappointed by the personnel decisions VW took and the information they provided.\u201d Union Investments does not have the power to push out M\u00fcller on its own. The group owns just 0.5% of VW. But this still makes Union one of its top 15 shareholders and an influential voice in the debate about the future of the world\u2019s second-largest carmaker. VW is controlled by the Porsche and Piech family, who own 50.73% of the voting rights. The state of Lower Saxony owns a further 20%, while Qatar Holding has 17%. Just 12.3% of the shares are held by other institutions. Invesco Perpetual, the British fund manager which owns a small stake in VW, also called on the carmaker to overhaul its culture, but gave its backing to M\u00fcller. Stephen Anness and Andrew Hall, global equities managers atInvesco, said: \u201cWe think this corporate scandal could catalyse organisational change at a group that has historically demonstrated questionable corporate governance practices. Listening to the new CEO, Matthias M\u00fcller, present the Q3 results provided some early indications of potential change. \u201cSometimes a crisis can be good for a company. With a new CEO, new CFO and two well-regarded external appointments to the management board, we see some chance of a healthy cultural change occurring.\u201d VW has hired US law firm Jones Day and auditors Deloitte to run an internal investigation into the scandal. It has given employees until 30 November to come forward with information about how the company cheated emissions tests, and guaranteed they would not be fired if they did so. In a letter to employees, Herbert Diess, head of the Volkswagen brand, said this offer was being made in the interests of \u201cfull and swift clarification\u201d of the scandal. The carmaker has put aside \u20ac6.7bn (\u00a34.7bn) to meet the cost of recalling the 11m vehicles, but it also faces the threat of fines and legal action from shareholders and customers. VW has said the economic risks of the CO2 discovery are \u20ac2bn. The sum is thought to relate to tax credits the company could be forced to repay in Europe if it is found that VW cars were emitting more CO2 than thought and should have therefore been liable for higher vehicle tax payments.",

    "webTitle": "Boss of Adani's Australian arm linked to mining pollution in Zambia", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of the Australian arm of Adani has been linked to a mining pollution case in Africa, prompting renewed questions about the Indian company\u2019s suitability to run this country\u2019s largest proposed coalmine. A joint report by Environmental Justice Australia reveals Jeyakumar Janakaraj held senior roles at a miner that pleaded guilty to criminal charges over the poisoning of a river in Zambia before taking up his role heading Adani\u2019s Australian operations. Janakaraj was operations director at Koncola Copper Mines (KCM) in 2010 when the company was charged for polluting the Kafue river with toxic wastewater. The company pleaded guilty and was fined 21,970,000 Zambian kwacha (about $A4,030). It was also found to have wilfully failed to report the pollution of the river, which was a source of drinking water, fishing and irrigation for local communities. More than 1,800 Zambians who allege KCM was responsible for pollution that led to illness and destruction of farmland from 2004, have now lodged a fresh claim against the company in the high court in London. Janakaraj, who worked at KCM from 2008 to 2013, is named in the claim as one of the executives expected to know in detail about its mining operations and pollution control measures, according to an ABC report. EJA lawyer Ariane Wilkinson, co-author of a report with US-based Earthjustice called Can the Adani Group be trusted to comply with environmental laws?, said the same offences in Australia \u201ccould form a legal basis for cancellation of Adani\u2019s registration as a suitable operator\u201d. This was a pre-condition for gaining a state-issued environmental authority in Queensland, where Adani plans to build the Carmichael mine, a 40m tonne a year coal project in the Galilee Basin. Wilkinson called on federal environment minister Greg Hunt and the director general of Queensland\u2019s department of environment and heritage protection to \u201cadequately scrutinise the environmental track record of the Adani Group and properly consider whether it is worth the risk to allow this enormous coalmine, which will impact our Great Barrier Reef, to proceed\u201d. Earthjustice\u2019s US-based managing attorney Martin Wagner said Adani should \u201cnot be allowed to operate any mine in Australia if it and its executives cannot demonstrate a record of safe mining operations and compliance with the law\u201d. \u201cThis new information about environmental harms and legal violations in Zambia, coupled with evidence of the Adani Group\u2019s (alleged) involvement in environmental harm in India and failure to comply with Indian law and environmental permits, is relevant to determining whether the Adani Group can make such a showing.\u201d Hunt recently gave the Carmichael mine environmental approval in a decision that is now subject to a federal court challenge by the Australian Conservation Foundation, which alleges he did not properly consider its climate change impact on the reef. A spokesman for Hunt told the ABC that his department would \u201cseek clarification\u201d from Adani on the issues raised by the EJA report. An Adani spokesman said in a statement that Janakaraj had \u201cwide-ranging experience that has contributed to his acute belief in proactive good environmental management\u201d. \u201cThis is based on his early experience in Australia, where that respect for stringent management was part of the culture, and because he has seen around the world both directly and indirectly how hard managing legacy issues is,\u201d he said. \u201cThat includes the need to assist in managing legacy issues in Africa. He is confident that he has always worked to improve practices and leave projects in better shape than he found them.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Rolls-Royce's troubles run deep \u2013 it's odd no one spotted them sooner", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Four profit warnings from Rolls-Royce in 18 months tell you two things. First, forget the old idea that life moves slowly for a company with long development programmes, a multi-decade order book and high barriers to entry. Second, management is hopeless at predicting the future. The engine maker\u2019s chief executive, Warren East, is immune to the second charge for the time being, since he has been in the hot seat only since July. His dose of plain-speaking \u2013 it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d for Rolls-Royce to carry so much fixed cost and be so inflexible during inevitable industry downturns \u2013 is welcome after more wishful thinking under his predecessor John Rishton. It is astonishing to remember that Rishton launched a \u00a31bn share buyback last December, paying up to \u00a310 a pop for shares that now trade at 530p, after Thursday\u2019s 20% plunge. The buyback was as fine an example of delusional boardroom self-confidence as you could wish to see. East, sensibly, cancelled it as his first act, preventing half the cash from being squandered. Reprogramming Rolls-Royce for a tougher marketplace will be harder. The profit \u201cheadwinds\u201d, as East calls them, are getting stronger every time he sticks a wet finger in the air. July\u2019s estimate of a \u00a3300m hit in 2016 has become \u00a3650m and the cold blasts are coming from every division. Oil sheikhs, fretting about the oil price, and Russian oligarchs, with the additional worry of sanctions, are buying fewer corporate jets. Commercial airlines, also contemplating the low oil price, can delay investment in modern fuel-efficient engines. The Trent 700 engine, a lucrative earner of old, is suffering a painful end to its working life, with orders falling short on both price and quantity. In marine, it\u2019s a predictable story of oil explorers and developers cutting capital expenditure and cancelling orders. East plans incremental cost savings of \u00a3150m-\u00a3200m a year, with the benefits expected to arrive from 2017. It all helps but the bald numbers only hint at the scale of the upheaval required to make \u201cfundamental changes\u201d to the company\u2019s structure and way of working. This is much more than an old-fashioned cost-cutting exercise. East wants \u201cgreater pace and accountability to decision making\u201d and an upgrade to business systems. Rolls sounds basically unfit to compete effectively. There are consolations for investors. The order book stood at \u00a376bn at the last count. The balance sheet is strong. Profits will still be about \u00a31bn this year. Free cashflow is almost non-existent but Rolls can clearly afford a hefty restructuring bill. It is also one of only three companies in the world capable of developing and manufacturing mass-market aerospace engines. And the market will also turn eventually. The company ought to be capable of getting its house in order. How long will it take? If East can fix Rolls within half a decade he will have done well. When a major UK company can travel from share buyback to possible dividend cut within a year, the troubles clearly go very deep. VW crisis: outsiders needed It is a safe bet that Volkswagen will ignore a call from one of Germany\u2019s largest institutional investors for the embattled car-maker to replace its new chief executive and chairman. Matthias M\u00fcller and Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch have been in their respective posts only a few weeks and were selected from VW\u2019s executive ranks specifically to investigate the emissions cheating scandal. In any case, Union Investment owns only 0.5% of VW\u2019s preference shares and thus can be dismissed as a minority voice. The problem, however, is that Ingo Speich of Union Investment makes an excellent point to the FT: VW desperately needs outside leadership to restore some credibility to its investigations. The performance so far has been miserable. M\u00fcller, while proclaiming to be pursuing a \u201crelentless and comprehensive clarification of events,\u201d has offered no insight to what went wrong. Worse, some of his statements have appeared deliberately ambiguous. When VW confessed earlier this month that the scandal also covered emissions of carbon dioxide, not just nitrogen oxide, it failed to say what its cost estimate of \u20ac2bn covered or how the figure was derived. It is hard to believe, in similar circumstances, shareholders in a FTSE 100 company would tolerate a similar drip-feed of incomplete and inadequate information. They would demand a senior outsider, with no previous connections to the company, be put on the job. By contrast, M\u00fcller is a VW lifer and P\u00f6tsch is the former finance director. It all looks too cosy \u2013 an attempt to preserve the boardroom carve-up between family shareholders, local Saxony officials and trade union appointees. Somebody should be asking whether cosy-looking governance was part of the problem in the first place \u2013 and only an outsider can do that. Another commodity casualty It was another bad day for miners\u2019 share prices, hit by a falling copper price (again), Opec\u2019s report of a glut of oil and an 84% drop in quarterly profit at Noble Group, Asia\u2019s biggest commodity trader. Amid the collapsing stock market values, one London-listed stock stands down. No, not Glencore - though it\u2019s back below 100p - but Anglo-American. This 98-year old company, employing 148,000 people and with sales of \u00a320bn last year, is now worth just \u00a36.3bn. That means it is smaller than Hargreaves Lansdown, an administrator of private punters\u2019 savings established in the spare bedroom of a flat in Bristol in 1981.

First, forget the old idea that life moves slowly for a company with long development programmes, a multi-decade order book and high barriers to entry. Second, management is hopeless at predicting the future.</p> <p>The engine maker\u2019s chief executive, Warren East, is immune to the second charge for the time being, since he has been in the hot seat only since July. His dose of plain-speaking \u2013 it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d for Rolls-Royce to carry so much fixed cost and be so inflexible during inevitable industry downturns \u2013 is welcome after more wishful thinking under his predecessor John Rishton.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/rolls-royce-share-price-plunges-after-latest-profit-warning\">Rolls-Royce share price plunges after latest profit warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is astonishing to remember that Rishton launched a \u00a31bn share buyback last December, paying up to \u00a310 a pop for shares that now trade at 530p, after Thursday\u2019s 20% plunge. The buyback was as fine an example of delusional boardroom self-confidence as you could wish to see. East, sensibly, cancelled it as his first act, preventing half the cash from being squandered.</p> <p>Reprogramming Rolls-Royce for a tougher marketplace will be harder. The profit \u201cheadwinds\u201d, as East calls them, are getting stronger every time he sticks a wet finger in the air. July\u2019s estimate of a \u00a3300m hit in 2016 has become \u00a3650m and the cold blasts are coming from every division.</p> <p>Oil sheikhs, fretting about the oil price, and Russian oligarchs, with the additional worry of sanctions, are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/private-jet-makers-target-north-america-as-europe-flags\">buying fewer corporate jets</a>. Commercial airlines, also contemplating the low oil price, can delay investment in modern fuel-efficient engines. The Trent 700 engine, a lucrative earner of old, is suffering a painful end to its working life, with orders falling short on both price and quantity. In marine, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/22/north-sea-oil-production-rise-wrong-moment-make-profit\">it\u2019s a predictable story of oil explorers and developers cutting capital expenditure and cancelling orders</a>.</p> <p>East plans incremental cost savings of \u00a3150m-\u00a3200m a year, with the benefits expected to arrive from 2017. It all helps but the bald numbers only hint at the scale of the upheaval required to make \u201cfundamental changes\u201d to the company\u2019s structure and way of working. This is much more than an old-fashioned cost-cutting exercise. East wants \u201cgreater pace and accountability to decision making\u201d and an upgrade to business systems. Rolls sounds basically unfit to compete effectively.</p> <p>There are consolations for investors. The order book stood at \u00a376bn at the last count. The balance sheet is strong. Profits will still be about \u00a31bn this year. Free cashflow is almost non-existent but Rolls can clearly afford a hefty restructuring bill. It is also one of only three companies in the world capable of developing and manufacturing mass-market aerospace engines. And the market will also turn eventually. The company ought to be capable of getting its house in order.</p> <p>How long will it take? If East can fix Rolls within half a decade he will have done well. When a major UK company can travel from share buyback to possible dividend cut within a year, the troubles clearly go very deep.</p> <h2>VW crisis: outsiders needed</h2> <p>It is a safe bet that Volkswagen will ignore a call from one of Germany\u2019s largest institutional investors for the embattled car-maker to replace its new chief executive and chairman. Matthias M\u00fcller and Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch have been in their respective posts only a few weeks and were selected from VW\u2019s executive ranks specifically to investigate the emissions cheating scandal. In any case, Union Investment owns only 0.5% of VW\u2019s preference shares and thus can be dismissed as a minority voice.</p> <p>The problem, however, is that Ingo Speich of Union Investment <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d74d9a2a-8955-11e5-90de-f44762bf9896.html#axzz3qzBpxlIv\">makes an excellent point to the FT</a>: VW desperately needs outside leadership to restore some credibility to its investigations. The performance so far has been miserable. M\u00fcller, while proclaiming to be pursuing a \u201crelentless and comprehensive clarification of events,\u201d has offered no insight to what went wrong.</p> <p>Worse, some of his statements have appeared deliberately ambiguous. When VW confessed earlier this month that the scandal also covered emissions of carbon dioxide, not just nitrogen oxide, it failed to say what its cost estimate of \u20ac2bn covered or how the figure was derived.</p> <p>It is hard to believe, in similar circumstances, shareholders in a FTSE 100 company would tolerate a similar drip-feed of incomplete and inadequate information. They would demand a senior outsider, with no previous connections to the company, be put on the job. By contrast, M\u00fcller is a VW lifer and P\u00f6tsch is the former finance director.</p> <p>It all looks too cosy \u2013 an attempt to preserve the boardroom carve-up between family shareholders, local Saxony officials and trade union appointees.

      "bodyText": "Sales of private jets for personal or business use nose dived after the financial crisis, and while their fall and rise roughly tracks the economic fortunes of the west, by some measures sales are still below 2005 levels. Rolls-Royce declined to disclose the numbers of corporate jet engine orders it had received, a quantity which helped sink its share price on Thursday. According to one analysis, it could be that the rival engine makers Pratt and Whitney are carving out a bigger chunk of Rolls-Royce\u2019s market, rather than it being a case of more trouble ahead for plane manufacturers. Gerald Khoo, a transport analyst at Liberum capital, said that, in terms of business jet usage as measured by air traffic control figures \u201cEurope looks awful ... it\u2019s down year on year in 44 of the past 48 quarters\u201d. He said the US did not look much better, as it had been flatlining below its long-term trend. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s partly the weakness of the European economy. But figures are down to 2005 levels: the economy\u2019s bad but not that bad. Usage has been weaker than you\u2019d have expected at this stage of the economic cycle. We\u2019ve all been asking ourselves why. The larger jet end of the market has held up better through the recession. One of the ways we rationalised that was that big jets are more the billionaire plaything rather than the business tool.\u201d The Federal Aviation Administration registered a slight decline in private flights in the US in September, where the level \u2013 around 4.3m operations in the last year \u2013 was generally recovering but still 12% below the 2007 peak. But the north American market is where the purveyors of corporate jets are focusing their efforts, as orders from the Bric countries dry up. Earlier this week, speaking at the Dubai airshow, the head of business jets for the Brazilian planemaker Embraer said that emerging market sales would slow for the next three years, while demand even in the big-spending Middle East was flat. A crackdown on corruption by China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has also been cited as a reason for the slowdown in jet sales in China. However, the long-term outlook remains good for private jet manufacturers, if not for the environment. Honeywell\u2019s most recent forecast, in late 2014, was for 9,450 new business jet deliveries worth $280bn (\u00a3184bn) over the next decade, with slightly more planes to be sold this year than last. A more recent forecast from Jetcraft, an international aircraft broker, foresees six more years of rapid growth with more than 1,000 private planes a year being sold by 2020, with large, ultra-long-range, jets making up the single biggest category. Chad Anderson, the president of Jetcraft, said: \u201cThe state of the market is improving slowly. North American buyers are coming back to life. The last upturn was heavily reliant on emerging markets, but there has been a relative slowdown there. The primary factor is that the US has the largest base of current owners, and one of the highest number of airports and adequate support. Some of the emerging markets are still building infrastructure and some of the blips on their screen have slowed that growth.\u201d He said there had been pent-up US demand until the last two to three years, but aircraft needed to be replaced and firms or individuals now had either cash or lenders. Europe remained slow, but Anderson said: \u201cIt is the world\u2019s second largest market in terms of existing owners so it\u2019s incredibly important. The trend though is that there has probably been more people exiting than buying.\u201d Fractional ownership companies such as NetJets have also placed multibillion-dollar orders in the last decade, while firms have developed Uber-style apps to make private jets available for more widespread booking, making the planes more like an extremely expensive taxi than the private Bentley parked in the drive. With increasing economic inequality, the jet market should continue to flourish. Anderson said: \u201cThe world continues to create more millionaires and billionaires, and it\u2019s unusual to find a billionaire without an aircraft.\u201d",

Some of the emerging markets are still building infrastructure and some of the blips on their screen have slowed that growth.\u201d</p> <p>He said there had been pent-up US demand until the last two to three years, but aircraft needed to be replaced and firms or individuals now had either cash or lenders.</p> <p>Europe remained slow, but Anderson said: \u201cIt is the world\u2019s second largest market in terms of existing owners so it\u2019s incredibly important. The trend though is that there has probably been more people exiting than buying.\u201d</p> <p>Fractional ownership companies such as NetJets have also placed multibillion-dollar orders in the last decade, while firms have developed Uber-style apps to make private jets available for more widespread booking, making the planes more like an extremely expensive taxi than the private Bentley parked in the drive.</p> <p>With increasing economic inequality, the jet market should continue to flourish. Anderson said: \u201cThe world continues to create more millionaires and billionaires, and it\u2019s unusual to find a billionaire without an aircraft.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned that up to 15m jobs in Britain are at risk of being lost to an age of robots where increasingly sophisticated machines do work that was previously the preserve of humans. Andy Haldane, the bank\u2019s chief economist, said automation posed a risk to almost half those employed in the UK and that a \u201cthird machine age\u201d would hollow out the labour market, widening the gap between rich and poor. The results of a Bank of England study, Haldane added, suggested that administrative, clerical and production tasks were most at threat. In a speech to the umbrella organisation for Britain\u2019s trade unions, the TUC, he asked if the Luddites \u2013 reputed to have smashed machines during the Industrial Revolution \u2013 had been proved right two centuries on. \u201cTechnology appears to be resulting in faster, wider and deeper degrees of hollowing-out than in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because 20th-century machines have substituted not just for manual human tasks, but cognitive ones too. The set of human skills machines could reproduce, at lower cost, has both widened and deepened.\u201d With machines becoming ever smarter, Haldane said a wider array of jobs were at risk from automation than in the past. Low-paid jobs were most at risk, but the \u201chollowing out\u201d would increasingly affect mid-skill jobs as well. Haldane said the Bank had used methodology pioneered in the US to model the impact of smarter machines on the UK labour market and its more than 30 million employees. It classified jobs into three categories \u2013 those with a high (greater than 66%), medium (33-66%) and low (less than 33%) probability of automation, and made an adjustment for the proportion of employment those jobs represented. \u201cFor the UK, roughly a third of jobs by employment fall into each category, with those occupations most at risk including administrative, clerical and production tasks. \u201cTaking the probabilities of automation, and multiplying them by the numbers employed, gives a broad brush estimate of the number of jobs potentially automatable. For the UK, that would suggest up to 15m jobs could be at risk of automation.\u201d Haldane said the first industrial revolution had occurred in the middle of the 18th century and the second in the latter half of the 19th century. The third industrial evolution \u2013 the era of information technology \u2013 appeared to have resulted in an intensification of trends seen in the first two: \u201ca hollowing-out of employment, a widening distribution of wages and a fall in labour\u2019s income share. The key question is what happens next? A re-run of the 19th century, with productivity gains eventually boosting wages and the labour share? Or, different than in the past, a permanent re-shaping of the labour landscape?\u201d The Bank\u2019s chief economist said technological advances since the 18th century had always had the effect of widening the gap between the skilled and unskilled, but there were signs that this process was speeding up. Haldane added that as technology improved, there was a greater likelihood that \u201cthe space remaining for uniquely human skills could shrink further\u201d. He said: \u201cIf these visions were to be realised, however futuristic this sounds, the labour market patterns of the past three centuries would shift to warp speed. \u201cIf the option of skilling up is no longer available, this increases the risk of large scale un- or under-employment. The wage premium for those occupying skilled positions could explode, further widening wage differentials.\u201d And labour\u2019s share of the pie could fall even more dramatically than in the past. \u201cOn this view, the tree would be so thoroughly hollowed-out that it may no longer be able to support itself.\u201d Haldane said the increasing automation of the workplace might already be helping to depress wage growth, explaining why inflation has consistently undershot the government\u2019s 2% target. The Bank\u2019s official forecast is for inflation to return to 2% in two years\u2019 time, but Haldane said this assumed that labour\u2019s share of national income recovered to its pre-crisis trend. If it did not do so, inflation would rise to 1.6%, a level that would not justify the Bank\u2019s MPC voting for higher interest rates. \u201cAgainst that backdrop, my view is that the case for raising interest rates is still some way from being made. Whatever the reason, the economic aircraft appears to be losing speed on the runway. That is an awkward, indeed risky, time to be contemplating takeoff.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce\u2019s share price plunged more than 20% after the British engine maker said it may cut its dividend as it issued a fourth profit warning in just over a year. The company, which supplies engines for aircraft, ships and industrial use, blamed falling demand for corporate jets in Brazil, China and south-east Asia following China\u2019s economic slowdown, as well as the slump in oil prices which has affected its energy customers. Shares in Rolls-Royce plunged 21% to 527p in early trading after the profit warning on Thursday, recovering to close at 536.5p. Its new chief executive, Warren East, the former boss of microprocessor firm ARM who took over from John Rishton in July, also announced a major restructuring programme for next year to reduce fixed costs, streamline senior management and improve decision-making, all aimed at saving up to \u00a3200m a year. Rolls-Royce employs 2,000 senior managers around the world. It is already cutting 3,600 jobs in its aerospace and marine arms. Its marine unit, which accounts for half of profits, is expected to make a loss in 2016 following a plunge in oil prices. Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliners and Airbus A380 superjumbos, has been betting on wide-bodied aircraft and by 2020 half the world\u2019s jumbo jets will be powered by its engines. However, the trend among regional airline operators is towards single-aisle plane orders. Rolls-royce missed out on the two new Gulfstream aircraft, G500 and G600, for which US rival Pratt &amp; Whitney, owned by United Technologies, won the engine contract. The Derby-based group now expects profit \u201cheadwinds\u201d of \u00a3650m next year, more than double the \u00a3300m cut to profit identified in July. Analysts had already slashed their forecasts for underlying pretax profits to \u00a31.053bn before the latest downgrade. This means profits will be at least 30% below this forecast. It is East\u2019s second profit warning in the job. He has wasted no time and announced the outcome of his business review two weeks early. He said: \u201cWhile 2015 remains broadly as expected, the outlook for 2016 is very challenging. The speed and magnitude of change in some of our markets, which have historically performed well, has been significant and shows how sensitive parts of our business are to market conditions in the short-term.\u201d Another update will come on 24 November. The engine maker\u2019s fortunes turned after a decade of rising sales, leading to a series of profit warnings from early last year. Annual profits more than halved in July. Rolls-Royce said the US activist hedge fund Value Act had requested a seat on the board. The San Francisco-based firm has built a stake in the company and become its biggest investor, triggering speculation that the business could be broken up. Analysts at Jefferies were hopeful that Rolls-Royce\u2019s fortunes could improve. \u201cSome bad news on profits has probably arrived today rather than over a period of years,\u201d they said. \u201cThe relatively robust 2016 cash flow is some solace and likewise the new management team stamping its authority on things through a more profound restructuring.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "OK, it\u2019s time for a recap after a fairly dramatic day. The first general strike since Alexis Tsipras took power in Greece has been marred by isolated violence in Athens. Riot police fired tear gas after a group of extremists launched Molotov cocktails at them, in scenes reminiscent of the 2012 debt crisis. Petrol bombs were also thrown at bins, a van, roadblocks, and the front of the Bank of Greece\u2019s offices. Reporters on the scene said groups of youths were behind the disruption. Riot police hit back with teargas and stun grenades, sending demonstrators - and at least one group of holidaymakers from the UK - scattering. Before the clashes, more than 20,000 people marched through Athens to urge the government to abandon the austerity measures demanded by its lenders. Here\u2019s a selection of photos from the day. Demonstrators told us that they fear for Greece\u2019s future, as winter approached. Marilena Pavlou, a nursery school teacher, warned: \u201cThe situation is tragic and soon when the government pushes us more on the tax front, more on the cuts front it won\u2019t be good natured at all. And 63-year-old Maria Athanassiadou told AFP: \u201cI am protesting against the government because they are making fools of us. I am a pensioner and I have no idea what my pension will be.\u201d Unions say that today\u2019s general strike was well-observed across Greece, as the public show their anger over Greece\u2019s third bailout package. But small businesses have criticised unions for calling the walkout. They fear it will harm the country\u2019s attempts to end the financial crisis. Transport connections have been shut down today, along with some museums, schools and pharmacies. Many travellers arrived at rail stations or ports to find trains cancelled, and ferries tied up. Belgium\u2019s finance minister criticised Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party for supporting the protests, against a bailout which Tsipras signed up to this summer. But a government spokesman denied that this was inconsistent, as: \u201cWe are implementing an agreement which includes (bailout) measures which are unfair.\u201d And while the protests took place, officials from Greece and its lenders battled to reach a deal on mortgage arrears rules. Athens still wants to protect more homeowners from losing their houses if they can\u2019t meet their repayments. A deal must come before Monday, if Greece is to unlock \u20ac10bn of aid to recapitalise its banks, plus \u20ac2bn in loans. We\u2019re hearing that petrol bombs were thrown at the headquarters of the left-wing Pasok party in downtown Athens, and that no-one was hurt. Greece\u2019s unions are declaring today\u2019s general strike a success. Helena Smith has the details: ADEDY, the civil servants\u2019 trade union which reckons the strike\u2019s turnout was at least 65% across Greece. Grigoris Kalomoiris, who sits on the union\u2019s executive committee, tells me: \u201cAs industrial action goes it was very successful. We estimate at least 65% and perhaps as much as 70% participated. Rallies in regional towns outside Athens was especially high.\u201d These photos show how the anti-austerity demonstration in Athens began in a good-hearted, peaceful fashion, before a group of extremists clashed with riot police: Not everyone in Greece backs today\u2019s general strike, reports Helena Smith. Those in the private sector, now generating most of the country\u2019s wealth, are furious at what they regard as the indulged antics of pampered public sector workers widely seen as the root cause of Greece\u2019s economic woes. Shopkeepers in central Athens this morning were irate that they should be made to bear the brunt of yet more protests \u2013 and appalled that the GSEE, the union representing private sector workers was actually backing it. \u201cAll I want to do is get on with the business of selling [eye] glasses,\u201d said Spyros Gerakidis, an optician whose family-run business is within walking distance of Syntagma square. \u201cEvery time there are strikes and rallies it messes up the market.\u201d I have been getting an extraordinary rap for my piece earlier today citing trade unionists and far left activists who organized the strike. Greece, say critics, is moving ever closer to becoming a failed state precisely because of its failure to modernize and deal with its cumbersome state apparatus. \u201cIt is no secret that the Greek public sector not only represents a terrible burden on taxpayers (various tax and social security withholdings represent approximately 50% of payroll cost), but in addition is profoundly corrupt,\u201d wrote one prominent Athenian business lawyer, in an email today. He claims that, by not reforming, the Greek public sector is causing \u201ceconomic regression and social decay\u201d. \u201cThe Greek public sector serves not the interests of our society but the interests of public sector employees, both by the extraction of favourable employment terms and the absolute lack of effective management (including any form of evaluation.\u201d As a result, Greece\u2019 mammoth fiscal adjustment had moved predominantly to the private sector which had also borne the brunt of record unemployment. Tear gas and petrol bombs are not what you hope for during a holiday. So Katie Wallace, from Glasgow, had an unpleasant surprise today when the violence kicked off in Athens. She tells me that she hadn\u2019t known about the protests until Wednesday, when she asked a barman to translate one of the posters that had been stuck up around the capital. Their hotel assured Katie that Athens would be \u201ccompletely safe\u201d, so she happily visited a cafe...and Molotov cocktails landed close by. We now have video footage of today\u2019s clashes: Not every young person in Greece went round chucking petrol bombs today. In the city of Patras, school students led a protest march against the new austerity measures which include budget cuts to education. The small group of protesters behind today\u2019s violence have moved back to the Exharchia region of downtown Athens, leaving quite a mess behind: More photos of the clashes which broke out earlier are coming in: Greece\u2019s prime minister may not see the protests in Athens first-hand. He\u2019s attending the EU/Africa summit on migration in Malta today, where he\u2019s shared a joke with German chancellor Angela Merkel. The Greek prime minister\u2019s increasingly cosy relationship with the woman he once vilified has unnerved Greeks who once gave him their unqualified support, reports Helena Smith. Aides have reportedly told the leftist leader to smile less! Tsipras doesn\u2019t have much to smile about when it comes to the crisis -- the Commission is reportedly putting pressure on Greece not to push refugees on into the EU. Petrol bombs have also been thrown at the offices of the National Bank of Greece. There\u2019s a video clip of the incident here, on Naftemporiki\u2019s website. The AFP newswire has more details about how the violence unfolded one hour ago: As the demonstration kicked off, scores of youths began vandalising shops, bus stops and traffic lights, according to an AFP reporter at the scene. The violence began when around 150 youths attacked police stationed in front of a row of luxury hotels on central Syntagma square, then quickly retreated. During the unrest, youths also set a car alight with Molotov cocktails. This video appears to show the OTE van which was hit by a petrol bomb today (see earlier post). Despite being burned out, the van\u2019s windscreen wipers are still defiantly working. Another photo of the moment that petrol bombs were thrown in Athens: The clashes have now moved from Syntagma Square to nearby Omonia Square. Helena Smith reports from Athens. Youths belonging to the \u201canti-establishment\u201d black bloc have set fire to road blocks and a van belonging to the partly owned state telecommunications company OTE. Greek police, who I encountered in Syntagma, said the protestors \u201cdeliberately targeted\u201d the tomb of the unknown soldier. Here\u2019s a video clip of this morning\u2019s demonstrations: Associated Press reports that the petrol bombs were thrown by a group of \u2018youths\u2019, triggering a predictable response from the riot police: Clashes have broken out between riot police and youths at a demonstration in central Athens during the first general strike since the country\u2019s left-led government initially came to power in January. Youths broke away from a protest march Thursday, throwing Molotov cocktails at police who responded with tear gas and stun grenades. The protests had been proceeding peacefully, before the (sadly familiar) sight of petrol bombs and tear gas in Athens. AP\u2019s Derek Gatopoulos reports that the violence was \u201climited\u201d, and that some paving stones in Syntagma Square were broken up too: Here\u2019s Reuters early report from the Greek capital: Greek police fired tear gas to disperse anti-austerity protesters hurling petrol bombs in central in Athens on Thursday. Earlier, thousands took to the streets to protest against EU/IMF-imposed austerity measures in the first nationwide strike called by Greece\u2019s main public and private sector unions since leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras came to power in January. Some demonstrators are now reforming into groups, as the situation calms down. The demonstrators who had been protesting peacefully outside the Greek parliament are now leaving quickly, as scores of riot police clear the area. Explosions are suddenly ringing out across the Greek capital. Petrol bombs have just been thrown at the Greek riot police in Syntagma Square, who have also fired tear gas at protesters. Another group of demonstrators just arrived at Syntagma Square, to join the large group of banner-waving protesters already outside the parliament building: (that\u2019s via the RT livefeed) Athens police reckon that around 24,000 people have taken to the streets in the capital, according to AP\u2019s Elena Becatoros: We\u2019re asking the unions if they agree.... Twitter user Joanna P is tweeting photos from the protests in the city of Thessaloniki, including shots of riot police: She\u2019s also spotted some anti-Tsipras slogans: Russia Today are carrying a live TV feed from Athens. It currently shows groups of protesters with banners massing at Syntagma Square, outside the Greek parliament. It looks like a solid turnout in Athens, and a peaceful protest too: Thousands of people have now gathered in Syntagma Square, the site of the Athens parliament, to protest against the third Greek bailout package: Pame trade unionists have also managed to draw big crowds to a well-attended rally in the northern Greek capital of Thessaloniki. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Thousands are reported to have gathered in central Thessaloniki with online news media (those which are working, anyway) describing the protest as a blow against the \u201cdefeatism\u201d that has marked Greece\u2019s debt crisis to date. The newsit.gr site reported demonstrators as saying. \u201cThe time has now come to take matters into our hands, to wage war to avert a new crime. No submission to defeatism, fatalism, the logic that nothing can happen.\u201d By waging an \u201corganised battle,\u201d protestors could prevent new cost-cutting measures from being taken and win back lost rights, organisers were quoted as saying. Dimitris Karageorgopoulos, press secretary of the GSEE union, has told CNBC that the Greek government cannot backtrack on its pledges to ease austerity: Before the elections, there were some promises to society. If the tactic of the government is \u2018whatever we said, holds no more\u2019, they will find the workforce in front of them. We owe it to our families, our pensioners, and the young people who are leaving Greece. We can\u2019t take this anymore. Not just the measures, but being fooled\u201d. Kathimerini\u2019s cartoonist has taken a pop at prime minister Alexis Tsipras, over Syriza\u2019s support for today\u2019s protests: When it comes to an organised protest, you can\u2019t beat Greece\u2019s PAME union: Associated Press confirms that public services have shut down across Greece today, in the first general strike since Syriza won power in January. Public transport was severely disrupted, with the Athens metro not running, bus and trolley routes reduced and ferries tied up in port, severing connections between islands and the mainland. The strike shut down museums, schools and pharmacies, while state hospitals were functioning with emergency staff. More than a dozen domestic flights were canceled, while journalists also walked off the job, pulling news bulletins off the air except to report on the strike. News websites were not being updated, while no Friday newspapers were to be printed. Rail travellers are also out of luck: Members of PAME, the Communist-affiliated union, are now marching through Athens: Syriza\u2019s decision to publicly support today\u2019s strike is being widely commented on in Athens, and abroad: It shows who actually holds the levers of power in Athens, argues Bruno Waterfield of The Times: Mario Draghi\u2019s defence of the eurozone\u2019s austerity programmes is being challenged by MEPs from Ireland: Ireland was controversially forced to nationalise its failed banks under pressure from the ECB, sparing bondholders from losses at the expense of the Irish taxpayer. Protestors representing the country\u2019s two biggest unions in both the public and private sector are converging on Klafmonos square in central Athens now for today\u2019s protest rally Helena Smith reports: Their central slogan; \u201cNo to new and old memorandums.\u201d Under bright sunshine Klafmonos - so named for the workers who wept in the square more than a century ago when successive governments swept them from their public sector jobs - has become a sea of good-natured resistance. Marilena Pavlou, a nursery school teacher told me that the mood will soon darken. \u201cThe situation is tragic and soon when the government pushes us more on the tax front, more on the cuts front it won\u2019t be good natured at all. \u201cEveryone I know is dreading this winter. We are caught up in a vicious cycle, the government knows that, the people know that, the Europeans know it too. All my friends who supported Syriza are beginning to leave en masse. It\u2019s scary.\u201d By 10:45 AM local time central Athens had been turned into a vast mass of protestors with Pame, the militant communist-backed union, drawing thousands onto the streets in a march on parliament, up from Omonia square. Taxes, salaries and what is widely perceived as the ransacking of the social security system in the form of pension cuts, are the focus of the protests - and the myriad banners held aloft by protestors. Giorgos Tsoukas, an erstwhile factory manager, says he spent 40 years contributing to social security payments only \u201cto see it all collapse before I could enjoy any of it.\u201d \u201cEvery month my pension has been cut by 50 euro or more and the government expects me to keep coughing up more in taxes.\u201d Tourists hoping to visit the legendary Acropolis in Athens today are in for disappointment. It\u2019s closed today, as staff take part in the walkout: Back in Greece, government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili has denied that Syriza is wrong to support today\u2019s protests against the bailout programme it signed up to. Reuters has the details: The party has said it will implement its side of the bargain with lenders, but has long maintained that the bailout terms are excessively harsh. \u201cWe are implementing an agreement which includes (bailout) measures which are unfair,\u201d Gerovasili said. It\u2019s wrong to blame the European Central Bank for the austerity misery suffered by bailed-out eurozone members, Mario Draghi claims. The ECB chief is defending the way events unfolded in Ireland, Greece, Cyprus and beyond, arguing that things would have been even worse without the \u2018adjustment programmes\u2019 demanded by creditor. During his testimony to the European Parliament, Draghi says: Since 2010, three countries have now successfully completed their programmes, and Ireland is a particularly good example of how such programmes can deliver the necessary adjustment and restore financial stability, economic competitiveness and fiscal sustainability. It has shown that a country which takes strong ownership of its programme can come out of it with robust growth and a more stable financial system, and that eventually employment will also rebound. There is no doubt that the adjustment process was painful. But we should keep in mind that the adjustment would have caused significantly more hardship in the absence of financial assistance. The programmes had to address excessive macroeconomic imbalances which had accumulated over several years in the run-up to the crisis, often reflecting misguided national economic policies. As we have said before: don\u2019t blame the fire damage on the fire brigade. Central bankers are never wrong about anything, of course. But critics will argue that some of the austerity measures forced on Greece actually threw petrol, not water, on the flames, helping to wipe out 25% of GDP. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi has begun testifying to the European Parliament, and sent the euro falling. Draghi began by warning that the eurozone faces clear \u2018downside risks\u2019 from the global economy, and weakening inflation pressure too. Here\u2019s the key quote: Downside risks stemming from global growth and trade are clearly visible. Moreover, inflation dynamics have somewhat weakened, mainly due to lower oil prices and the delayed effects of the stronger euro exchange rate seen earlier in the year. In addition, price pressures \u2013 such as from producer prices \u2013 remain very subdued. And he followed up with a hint that further stimulus may be required, perhaps as soon as next month: Today\u2019s walkout could be the start of a winter of discontent in Greece. Unions are vowing to intensify the pressure against further austerity measures being implemented, arguing that Greek citizens cannot take any more. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports: \u201cThe winter is going to be explosive and this will mark the beginning,\u201d said Grigoris Kalomoiris, a leading member of the civil servants\u2019 union Adedy. \u201cWhen the average wage has already been cut by 30%, when salaries are already unacceptably low, when the social security system is at risk of collapse, we cannot sit still,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s her early report on the general strike: Back in the City, shares in UK engineering group Rolls-Royce have plunged by a fifth at the start of trading. The company has shocked investors with another profits warning, saying that the outlook for 2016 has deteriorated sharply and is now \u2018very challenging\u2019. All Greece\u2019s public services, including tax offices and utilities, are due to be closed today to mark the general strike: The Kathimerini newspaper has the details: Public hospitals will be operating with skeleton staff. Pharmacists, doctors, teachers and bank employees will also walk off the job. The Athens metro will be shut throughout the day, as will the Proastiakos suburban railway and intercity trains. The Kifissia-Piraeus electric railway (ISAP) will only operate between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Buses in the capital will be out of service before 9 a.m. and after 9 p.m. There will be no ferry connections between the mainland and the islands as the Panhellenic Seamens\u2019 Federation (PNO) is also joining in the strike. Aegean Airlines and Olympic Air have announced flight cancellations for Thursday. Museums and archaeological sites will be shut as guards will not be working. Belgium\u2019s finance minister has just blasted Greece\u2019s ruling party for backing today\u2019s general strike, against a bailout it signed up to. Johan Van Overtveldt tweeted that the move \u201cstrange and dangerous\u201d, at a time when Athens should be racing to meet its bailout targets. In what may be a first for the eurozone, today\u2019s general strike is actually supported by the ruling party, Alexis Tsipras\u2019s Syriza coalition. Yesterday Syriza\u2019s Labor Policy Department called on all workers, unemployed, pensioners and students to join the general strike on Thursday. They urged citizens to \u201cactively respond\u201d to the pressure of creditors who continue \u201cthe dynamics of extreme, unpopular neoliberal policies.\u201d These policies, though, were accepted by Tsipras under huge pressure this summer, when Greece finally caved into a third bailout deal. It\u2019s quite a paradox... Today\u2019s walkout is the first general strike to hit Greece under prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s leadership: It will be a new experience for the left-wing leader, as Bloomberg reports: As Greek workers take to the streets in protest on Thursday, Alexis Tsipras will for the first time be on the other side of the barricades. Unions -- a key support base for the prime minister\u2019s Syriza party -- will chant the same slogans Tsipras once used against opponents. Doctors and pharmacists will join port workers, civil servants and Athens metro staff in Greece\u2019s first general strike since he took office in January, bringing the country to a standstill for 24 hours. ADEDY and GSEE, Greece\u2019s biggest unions, have called for a rally at 11 am local time [9am GMT], accusing Tsipras of bowing to creditors and imposing measures that \u201cperpetuate the dark ages for workers.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Public anger over Greece\u2019s third bailout will hit the streets today, as its biggest unions call a 24-hour walkout and protests in Athens. Greece will grind to a standstill as workers demonstrate against the tax rises and pension reforms agreed with its creditors this summer, in return for a third bailout. Shops and offices will be shuttered, and transport links disrupted, as Greeks vent their frustrations over the state of play. The scale of the protest will highlight how much public anger and disappointment is bubbling away in the country. A year which began with prime minister Alexis Tsipras promising to end austerity draws to an end with more painful cuts and tax hikes looming. The protests comes as the Athens authorities try to reach agreement with creditors to unlock the next tranche of aid from July\u2019s bailout deal. They are still at odds over how to implement laws covering mortgages in default and other bad debts. Greece has until Monday to reach a compromise, and unlock \u20ac2bn in loans plus \u20ac10-bn to recapitalise its banking sector. The stakes are rising again..... Also coming up this morning Mario Draghi, the ECB president, is due to testify at the European Parliament this morning, from 8.30am GMT (9.30am Brussels). He\u2019ll be fielding questions on the eurozone economy, the deflation threat, as well as Greece I imagine. A flurry of top Federal Reserve officials are also speaking today, including Fed chair Janet Yellen. That should set ears waggling in the City and on Wall Street, for hints that US interest rates may be hiked in December. While in the City, engine maker Rolls Royce has just cut its profit guidance for 2016 - more on that shortly.... Fashion group Burberry and cars-to-cycles group Halfords are also reporting results. Burberry, which issued a profits warning last month, has posted a 5% rise in adjusted profits for the last six months. But it also cautions that \u201cthe external environment became more challenging in key markets over the period\u201d. That\u2019s the slowing Chinese economy. And Halfords has warned that its cycling sales are down again, due to weakness in July and August. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s most influential railway executives has warned against radical reform of the industry as a government review signalled that privatisation of Network Rail was on the table. Tim O\u2019Toole, the chief executive of First Group, said that changing the structures that ran the railways risked more delay than it would help solve. After the crisis at Network Rail saw major upgrade schemes shelved in June, the government commissioned the HS1 chief executive, Nicola Shaw, to review how the railway is financed and managed. Her initial consultation report, issued on Wednesday, said that full privatisation and selling off assets or routes was under consideration. But O\u2019Toole warned against any major changes in direction for the sector. He said: \u201cFor the most part some dramatic redesign of the industry would represent more delays than it would actually fix anything.\u201d While he said Network Rail\u2019s record could be improved by better planning in consultation with train operators, he said that the crisis was overblown. \u201cIn some respects this is a phoney crisis. The costs in the determination that was made by the ORR [the rail regulator] aren\u2019t turning out that way \u2013 mainly because those estimates were made way too early and too optimistically. I don\u2019t think you solve that problem by changing the state of the industry and going through some seismic shift.\u201d He said that while \u201cpointing your finger at one party was not the issue\u201d, it was \u201ccritical that you have a very good regulator. I think everyone who\u2019s involved has real challenges here.\u201d A separate review from Network Rail chairman, Peter Hendy, will identify other schemes to be postponed after delays and escalating costs of electrification of the Great Western mainline, where First operates the rail franchise. O\u2019Toole said First was concerned that works \u201con the edges\u201d could be axed from the programme, such as signalling improvements on the route down to Cornwall and electrification of branch lines on the network. First Group fell into the red for the first six months of 2015, with its revenues slumping by \u00a3500m after the loss of two long-held rail franchises, Scotrail and Thameslink, but O\u2019Toole insisted that the business was getting back on track. \u201cIt plainly is a turnaround. The magnitude of these rail changes swamp everything else, especially in this period when we collect our money. You have to look through that ... We\u2019re comfortable with the progress we\u2019re making and clear about transformation plans.\u201d He added: \u201cThere was a time when rail had to underpin everything but buses are now coming to a place where they can drive the story. Rail becomes an additive and accelerant.\u201d O\u2019Toole said he welcomed the recent verdict in the Tyne and Wear bus battle, where the regional authority had wanted to restore public control of services \u2013 a move that could have led to similar moves in West Yorkshire, where First is a major operator. He said: \u201cWe were gratified by the decision, and hopefully it gets people to open their eyes that the fastest way to improve a service is through good, healthy partnerships.\u201d A Buses Bill, which could hand new powers over franchise buses to local authorities, is expected next year. O\u2019Toole said: \u201cI would be very concerned if regulation in that form would appear. That\u2019s why our job is to actively work on partnerships in places like Bristol, Cornwall and Sheffield to prove that partnerships are the best way to deliver. By proving it on the street you hold at bay all these other alternatives.\u201d First Group made pre-tax losses of \u00a37.5m in the first half of 2015-16, down from a profit of \u00a39.9m for the same period last year. Its revenues fell 17% from \u00a32.94bn to \u00a32.44bn.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s only potash mine is cutting hundreds of jobs and switching away from potash production in a further blow to industry in north-east England. The mine, in Boulby, plans to shed 220 jobs and 140 contractors from a total workforce of more than 1,000. Israel Chemicals (ICL), which owns the mine, will stop producing potash by 2018 and turn more attention to making Polysulphate \u2013 an environmentally friendly fertiliser, it said \u2013 at the site on the North York Moors. ICL said it had encountered geological problems at the 198-hectare (490-acre) mine which had affected production of potash. It now had only a small amount of economically viable reserves. Boulby is a few miles from Redcar, where 2,200 steelworkers have lost their jobs because of the closure of SSI\u2019s steelworks. The Cleveland area has relied on the remnants of a once large manufacturing base for well-paid jobs to support the local economy. Peter Smith, executive vice president for potash at ICL, said: \u201cWe understand that proposals for staffing reductions will cause concerns for employees and their families, as well as the wider community in east Cleveland. The process we are now embarking upon, although difficult and challenging, is aimed at ensuring that it will continue to be a major force in the local community.\u201d The company said it would spend up to \u00a340m at Boulby to increase production of Polysulphate, which it produces exclusively, from 200,000 tonnes this year to 1m tonnes in 2020. It might also build a granulation plant at the site. ICL said that once the switch was made it would remain a large employer in the area though not as big as before. Tim Bush, regional officer for Unite, a union representing 800 workers at the mine, said representatives would meet ICL this Friday to ask why the job losses were needed if the company was investing heavily in producing Polysulphate. Bush said: \u201cThis is another serious hammer blow to employment in the north-east. The region is already an area of high unemployment, which seems to be have been forgotten by government. We will be seeking to mitigate the number of job losses and will be strongly supporting our members in the days and weeks ahead. It is disastrous news for the workforce, their families and the regional economy.\u201d The Boulby mine, Britain\u2019s deepest, has produced more than 1m tonnes of potash and more than 500,000 tonnes of salt a year. Its potash is used for fertiliser production and glass making, and in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The salt is used for road maintenance, animal feed and sugar beet cultivation. Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar, said: \u201cThis is yet another blow to the community, who have already been subjected to thousands of job losses from the closure of SSI in Redcar in the last few weeks. My thoughts are with the miners and their families who have been affected by today\u2019s announcement.\u201d She said she would support Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, who is to seek an urgent question in parliament next week about problems faced by industry in Teesside.",

      "bodyText": "The long-awaited official report into what went wrong at HBOS \u2013 and who was to the blame for the near-collapse of the bank \u2013 is to be published next Thursday. The 500-page report will put fresh focus on the behaviour of bankers in the run-up to the 2008 crisis when HBOS had to be rescued by Lloyds and the enlarged bank then had to be bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayer funds. The report will published alongside an analysis by Andrew Green QC into the fines and penalties levied by the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator at the time of banking crisis. Peter Cummings, who ran the bank\u2019s commercial arm which lent billions to property companies, is the only former HBOS executive to be formally punished by the FSA. He was fined \u00a3500,000 and banned from working in the industry in 2012. The report into the near collapse of HBOS \u2013 formed when Halifax and Bank of Scotland merged in 2001 \u2013 began only after the Cummings enforcement action was published. The official verdict is being published by the two bodies that were set up to replace the FSA: the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) arm of the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). In April 2013 the parliamentary commission on banking standards, set up in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal, published its own verdict in which it blamed the three former top executives of HBOS for a \u201ccolossal failure\u201d of management. The report blamed Lord Stevenson, the former chairman, and former chief executives James Crosby and Andy Hornby. Shortly afterwards Crosby asked for his knighthood to be revoked and offered to hand back 30% of his \u00a3580,000 a year pension. The joint PRA/FCA report is long-delayed. It had been expected to be published in 2013 but the process of Maxwellisation \u2013 which allows individuals who are criticised in the report to respond \u2013 has delayed publication. John Griffith-Jones, the chairman the FCA, has recused himself from meetings of the regulator\u2019s board when the HBOS report is discussed as he was chairman of KPMG, the accountancy firm which audited HBOS.",

The group, which floated on London\u2019s Aim market in March 2014 when it raised \u00a327.6m, said the funds will help it maintain momentum as it rolls out its commercial laundry business in the Americas and Europe. Thursday\u2019s cash call comes just eight weeks after the appointment of chief executive, Mark Nichols. Xeros uses a bead system, which reduces the use of water, energy and chemicals in processes such as washing and clothing manufacturing. The system first emerged from research at the University of Leeds when Stephen Burkinshaw, a chemist at the university, found that certain plastics absorbed stains on clothes. The group\u2019s loss after tax rose from \u00a36.4m to \u00a310.2m, in line with expectations as it continued to invest in new technology as well as the roll-out of the laundry business. The US-owned City adviser Jefferies will be placing \u00a340m of shares so long as shareholders back the deal at the end of the month. Invesco, which owns a 26.9% stake in the group, is subscribing for enough new shares to maintain its holding. Two other large investors are supporting the share issue: IP Group, which is putting in \u00a34.7m, and Neil Woodford, the fund manager, whose fund will be maintaining an 8% stake. Xeros wants to exploit its polymer bead technologies across a number of industrial and domestic markets that face the challenges of water scarcity, environmental concerns and the cost of energy.",

The five members \u2013 including Zayn Malik, who left the band in March \u2013 racked up a pre-tax profit of \u00a345.4m, 10 times the previous year\u2019s figure of \u00a34.8m. But their company, 1D Media, handed over \u00a38.24m of its profits to the UK taxman, dwarfing the \u00a34,327 Facebook paid in 2014. The social media giant\u2019s tax bill was so small because it reported a loss of \u00a328.5m, after paying UK staff \u00a335m in share bonuses. Including duties paid overseas, One Direction\u2019s tax bill was \u00a310.5m, leaving the boys to share a take-home profit of \u00a334.9m. The results show a huge improvement on 2013, when the band made \u00a33.7m profit after paying \u00a31.1m in tax. Profits increased thanks to a jump in sales from \u00a349m to \u00a373.7m, while costs were slashed from \u00a344.3m to \u00a328.4m.

The band are known for UK chart-topping hits such as What Makes You Beautiful and One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks), a cover version of the songs by Blondie and the Undertones.

That is the day when, according to National Grid\u2019s forecast, the gap between Britain\u2019s energy needs and its power supply will be at its wafer-thinnest. To be clear, the power network company is as adamant as it can be that Britain will not be plunged into darkness by blackouts this winter. The energy regulator Ofgem agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that National Grid has the levers to manage the electricity system even in the most testing conditions,\u201d it said. National Grid has been forced to find increasingly inventive and expensive weapons to stave off power cuts. And despite its beefed-up armoury, it still risks sailing closer to the wind than is comfortable. For most of this winter, the power network company should not have too much of a problem. The margin between supply and demand is \u201ctight but manageable\u201d, with peak demand \u2013 on the coldest day at the busiest time \u2013 expected to be 54.2 gigawatts. This year, National Grid\u2019s crucial reserve margin \u2013 its capacity to produce more energy during peak demand \u2013 is 5.1%, meaning 57 megawatts will be available. The margin increased from a palpitation-inducing 1.2% only after it spent \u00a336.5m in the summer \u2013 equating to 50p on the average energy bill \u2013 on two new additions to its toolkit. One of these tools, which the company describes as \u201clast resort\u201d measures, was deployed earlier this month as unexpected generating plant shutdowns ate into the reserve margin. National Grid pressed the button on the new demand side balancing reserve, under which firms are paid to turn down their power usage. This was mostly achieved by switching off needless air-conditioning and, according to the company, showed that the system was working as it should. An even larger weapon, yet to be wielded, is the supplemental balancing reserve, under which power suppliers are paid to fire up mothballed power plants. So will these tools need to be called upon again? What\u2019s more, will they work? National Grid\u2019s projections suggest that the greatest cause for concern falls in the week beginning 11 January 2016. If there is a particularly cold spell during that week \u2013 and forecasters say we could be in for a savage winter \u2013 the company would first draw on its tried-and-tested methods. These include the short term operating reserve, a network of small power stations \u2013 many of them running on polluting and heavily subsidised diesel generators. It can also issue a notice of insufficient system margin, calling on power firms to increase the amount of energy they make available. One of these was sent out alongside the demand side balancing reserve earlier this month. Another possibility is to import more electricity from Europe via sub-sea interconnectors or reduce the amount being exported to Ireland. But not all of these measures are foolproof and most are expensive. In a cold winter, it would be costly for the National Grid to buy extra power from gas companies who are also fielding increased demand for household heating. The last time it did so \u2013 after issuing its recent notice of insufficient system margin \u2013 it had to spend an extra \u00a32.5m on power. Outgoing boss Steve Holliday reckons this could happen a further 10 times this winter. It may not be cheap or easy to get more out of the sub-sea interconnectors either. If France and the Netherlands are also feeling the chill, it will come down to who is willing to pay the most to get the electricity flowing their way. All of these extra costs will trickle down on to household energy bills eventually. Analysts warn of even greater pressure on the UK\u2019s energy increasingly threadbare safety cushion in the next couple of years. Peter Atherton, an energy analyst with stockbroker Jefferies, said: \u201cIt is self-evident that the UK power system is under increasing stress. Eventually that stress will manifest itself via security of supply events. \u201cEmergency measures that National Grid have put in place should be adequate for this winter. However, with four large coal stations closing ahead of next winter it is questionable whether existing measures will be enough.\u201d The coal-fired power stations are closing as the government struggles to meet the EU\u2019s target of 15% renewable energy by 2020. One high-profile example is the Yorkshire coal plant Eggborough, which produces 4% of UK electricity but is to close in March. With plants such as these out of commission, the demand side balancing reserve and supplemental balancing reserve should come into their own. However, they are yet to be renewed for next year, with the energy regulator scheduled to make a final decision later this month on whether to use and expand them. \u201cOfgem is minded to extend use of these additional balancing services so they are also available to National Grid in 16/17 and 17/18 and is consulting on this decision. The consultation closes [on Thursday],\u201d it said. National Grid said: \u201cWe believe the additional balancing services will be needed and used and we\u2019re working with Ofgem to get approval to use the services next winter. \u201cWe are doing the analysis for our more detailed outlook reports and will provide a timely update to the industry to help their market decisions. \u201cA lot can happen between now and winter 2016/17.\u201d Without an extension, according to Ofgem projections, Britain\u2019s reserve margin could be wiped out entirely, leaving us reliant on the wind to blow to provide any buffer zone. Beyond the next two years, Ofgem and the National Grid say the new capacity market, which will overhaul how suppliers are rewarded for making energy available, will consign blackout fears to the past. National Grid bosses will get the chance to explain to MPs how they will keep the lights on, when they come before the energy and climate chance select committee on 24 November. In the meantime, both the company and the regulator profess confidence that they have enough tools at their disposal to keep the lights on. Although there will be days when they are crossing their fingers. \u2022 Want to know how much energy Britain is using and where it comes from? Click here.",

On Thursday the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) said the bank was compensating about 200,000 holders of Progress Saver accounts. The accounts allowed consumers to gain bonus interest if they met certain criteria for deposits and withdrawals.

The bank was contacted by a customer who complained, and the bank reported the matter to Asic. Asic\u2019s deputy chairman, Peter Kell, said: \u201cANZ has taken its breach reporting obligations seriously in this matter. Breach reporting helps Asic ensure affected consumers are returned to the position they would have held if it were not for the breach occurring at all.\u201d ANZ\u2019s website says the Progress Saver accounts offer a 2.7% pa bonus rate when customers \u201cmake at least one single deposit of $10 or more in a month and there are no withdrawals, fees or charges processed to the account in that same month\u201d. The bank has written to current Progress Saver account holders to outline how the accounts work, and is contacting customers who may have not received bonus interest under the scheme. A spokeswoman for ANZ said the issue impacted just 0.5% of Progress Saver account holders. \u201cThere was an issue where some customers were either underpaid or overpaid the correct amount of bonus interest on their Progress Saver account,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would like to apologise to our customers for the error and any inconvenience caused.\u201d \u201cOver the past month we have been refunding the amount underpaid to impacted customers, which includes an additional amount of compensation in recognition of the bonus interest not being paid at the correct time. The majority of customers have now been reimbursed, and we expect the refund process will be finalised this week.\u201d The spokeswoman said a review had been completed and changes had been made to ensure the errors would not occur again.",
