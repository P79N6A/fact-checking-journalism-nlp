      "bodyText": "Poverty reduction in the world\u2019s poorest countries risks being diluted by the government\u2019s increasing tendency to devote a bigger slice of Britain\u2019s aid budget to pursuing the national interest, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned. The thinktank estimated that overseas development assistance would rise by \u00a31bn during the course of the next parliament as a result of Theresa May\u2019s pledge to continue meeting the United Nations 0.7% aid target. But it said that in recent years less of ODA spending was being channeled through the Department for International Development, with a growing emphasis on ensuring UK firms benefited. In a pre-election analysis, the IFS said Britain\u2019s spending on aid had almost doubled since Tony Blair promised to meet the UN target at the Gleneagles summit in July 2005. Spending had risen in inflation-adjusted terms from \u00a37.4bn to \u00a313.6bn in 2016 and was on course to reach almost \u00a315bn by 2021. Cross-party adherence to the 2005 promise meant that DfID was spared the austerity that affected most government departments after the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition came to power in 2010, the IFS said. DfID\u2019s budget had risen by 24% between 2010-11 and 2015-16, while the average cuts for departments outside of the NHS, education and defence were 28%. But the IFS said there had been a change of emphasis since 2015, with more than a quarter of the aid budget now being spent outside DFID in 2016 up from 14% two years earlier. \u201cSo far Theresa May has made it clear that if she wins the election she will uphold the UK\u2019s commitment to spending 0.7% of GNI [gross national income] on ODA\u201d, the IFS report said. \u201cHowever, across the main parties, there has been little indication of how this money will be spent and what balance they will aim to strike between national interest and global poverty alleviation goals in UK aid spending going forward.\u201d May has been under pressure from some of her own MPs and from Conservative-supporting newspapers to cut aid spending, but announced last month that she would be renewing the 0.7% pledge. Diverting some of the money to other departments \u2013 such business, energy and industrial strategy \u2013 is seen as a way of blunting the attacks. The IFS said that despite criticism of aid being squandered, overseas assistance was the most heavily scrutinised part of government spending, with oversight from the International Development Committee, the National Audit Office and the Independent Commission for Aid Impact. Sonya Krutikova, an author of the IFS report, said: \u201cThe UK is now recognised internationally as leading on shaping the global development agenda and the Department for International Development scores highly on the international Aid Transparency Index. \u201cA change of strategy since 2015 means that more emphasis is now put on using ODA spending for the UK\u2019s national interest. There is clearly a trade-off between this, spending outside of ODA altogether, and ensuring the money is used most effectively for global poverty alleviation.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An early burst of enthusiasm as Emmanuel Macron won the weekend\u2019s French presidential election saw the country\u2019s stock market hit a new nine year peak. But this soon wore off, as investors either took profits or decided Macron had done the easy part by winning and now faced the problem of getting his proposals agreed. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The French election turned out to be a buy the first round, sell the second round affair. French shares fell on Monday with the CAC index down significantly more than other European equity benchmarks. It\u2019s not disappointment in Macron, who is widely seen as business-friendly but just that the market saw this result coming a mile away. On top of that, some weaker than expected Chinese trade data hit commodity prices and thus mining shares, taking away some support for markets. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 edged up 3.43 points or 0.05% to 7300.86 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.18% to 12,694.55 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.91% at 5382.95 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.26% to 21,428.10 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.35% to 11,096.3 But in Greece, the Athens market added 1.25% to 763.42 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 4 points or 0.02%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The gains in the oil price on hopes of an extension to Opec\u2019s production cuts has now been reversed: The volatility index - the so-called fear index - has fallen again, in a sign of how calm the markets are at the moment: Over in Greece it has been officially announced that legislation of further creditor-demanded fiscal measures will take place next week. News of the vote came as Greek politicians welcomed Emmanuel Macron\u2019s election as France\u2019s new president. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After finally agreeing to the controversial policies, the Greek government will go through the process of legislating them in parliament next week, according to the assembly\u2019s president Nikos Voutsis. As of Monday 15, MPs sitting on an array of committees will discuss the measures, which range from pension cuts and tax increases to liberalising Sunday trade, before they are brought before the 300-seat chamber for debate on May 17 and then put to the vote on Thursday 18. Voutsis, who represents the ruling Syriza party, predicted that the policies would pass easily with no defections from the leftist party or its junior partner, the right wing Independent Greeks, despite a massive turnout at the weekend by retailers protesting against the prospect of shops opening on Sunday. Counter measures negotiated by the government offsetting losses in the event of a primary budget surplus target being achieved were also likely to be supported by opposition MPS who have otherwise threatened to reject the measures, he said. The policies come into force from January 1 2019. Legislation is crucial to eurogroup finance ministers agreeing to disburse further loans from Greece\u2019s third, \u20ac86bn bailout on May 22. Athens faces debt repayments of \u20ac7.5bn in early July \u2013 dues it could not honour without the emergency assistance. The agreement is expected to pave the way to serious talks on debt relief with Greek government officials expressing the hope that as newly elected president, Emmanuel Macron will help facilitate the process. Greece has long depended on France for backing in negotiations with the German-led EU. As France\u2019s former economy minister, Macron earned a reputation as an opponent of rigid austerity fuelling hopes in Athens that Paris will now actively help lobby the rest of the EU for debt relief. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras tweeted: \u201cEmmanuel Macron\u2019s victory is a breather for France and all of Europe. I am certain we will closely cooperate to change Europe\u2019s course; to again inspire its peoples, so as not to relive the nightmare of the extreme right.\u201d Later in the day deputy prime minister Giannis Dragasakis held talks with the French ambassador to Athens to highlight the issue of debt relief and Emmanuel Macron\u2019s support of it for the debt-stricken country. More on oil, from Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: On an otherwise dull afternoon, we have oil producing nations to thank for providing a degree of interest. Saudi Arabia, the only voice that really matters, has joined the chorus of those hinting at more production cuts to come, which has helped to keep oil steady above $46 per barrel. OPEC has to be credited for its efforts to keep the price up, but with shale oil now becoming increasingly viable and US production ramping up accordingly, it is no longer a case of just running faster to stay in the same place. OPEC would have to slash output dramatically to even begin putting a dent in the upward trend of oil output, and doing so would put intolerable financial pressure on many governments, including Riyadh. This dance has further to run, but at the moment its hard to see how it ends any way other than badly for OPEC. On the market reaction to Macron\u2019s victory, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: While the sense of relief is palpable amongst European leaders, markets have moved on and shifted their focus to the likelihood that the new French President will be able to enact his reform program, one of which is to pledge to reduce unemployment to 7%, a level only seen once in the last 30 years, at the beginning of 2008. Even if his party does well in next month\u2019s French assembly elections, getting a majority is likely to be a tall order. Looking at the votes cast gives a sense of the scale of the task, with Mr Macron getting over 20m votes, while Marine Le Pen got just over 10m. What was more telling was the number of votes that were spoiled or abstained which came to 15m, which brings a total of 25m voters who didn\u2019t like, or didn\u2019t care for the new President\u2019s vision for France. US markets have followed the pattern established in Europe. Open higher on relief that Emmanuel Macron won the French presidential election, then fall back on profit taking and concerns about whether he will be able to successfully undertake his proposed reforms. So after hitting new intra-day highs, both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have slipped back, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains down around 30 points or 0.16%. Meanwhile oil has moved back into positive territory on further talk that Opec\u2019s production deal could be extended beyond June. US markets have opened in mixed fashion, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both hitting record highs. The two indices opened around 0.2% higher, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average on the other hand is current down 24 points or 0.12%. Elsewhere oil prices are edging down despite Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister suggesting Opec would extend its current production cuts until the end of the year, and perhaps longer. The agreement, designed to support the flagging oil price, was due to be in force until the end of June, but Khalid al-Falih told a conference in Malaysia: The producer coalition is determined to do whatever it takes to achieve our target of bringing stock levels back to the five-year average. Based on the consultations I have had with participating members, I am rather confident the agreement will be extended into the second half of the year and possibly beyond. And I am also very confident that the global oil markets will soon rebalance and return to a healthy state. However crude prices have continued their recent slide, with Brent down 0.59% at $48.81 a barrel. US shale producers have been increasing output, taking up the slack from any Opec cutback. Peter Rosenstreich at Swissquote Bank said: Saudi oil minister Al-Falih has indicated that oil production cuts would likely be extended, which makes sense given the weak oil price. There is increasing expectation that the summer driving season will draw down inventories putting pressure on oil prices. Yet it\u2019s unlikely that OPEC\u2019s supply side efforts will transfer into the broader crude markets. US oil producers have become extremely nimble in reacting to volatility in demand. The WSJ\u2019s Mike Bird nails it: European stock markets have been enjoyed steady gains in 2017, with many indices up around 10% since 1 January. But ironically, Macron\u2019s victory might bring an end to the rally, argues Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank. He writes: We have been very positive on both the euro and European (mainly French) equities of late. Now, however, it\u2019s time to go neutral on both as Macron\u2019s real work will be vastly different from merely winning the presidency. The key, says Jakobsen, is Macron\u2019s ability to reform the economy: The one thing that France needs, of course, is labour market reform. A 10% unemployment rate is too high to create sustainable new growth and for Macron to succeed, he needs to \u201chelp\u201d Le Pen\u2019s voters \u2013 the disenfranchised, the anti-globalisation crowd who are afraid of worse to come. This is a formidable task, but Macron\u2019s timing is good. Europe has been through an \u201cinternal devaluation\u201d, so labour market reforms and a focus on creating instead of preserving jobs should do wonders for France. If this fails, however, it could easily tip the scales for Le Pen in five years\u2019 time. It\u2019s lunchtime in the City, but anyone expecting to celebrate a booming morning has been disappointed. Rather than rising like a decent French souffl\u00e9, the markets are stubbornly pancake-flat. The FTSE 100 has scrambled up by 12 points, but the other European markets are still down a little - with France\u2019s CAC 40 the laggard. One of those days when old City hands mutter sagely about \u2018selling the news\u2019, \u2018profit-taking\u2019 and so on. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says we shouldn\u2019t be surprised. He also suspects that weak trade data from China overnight has cast a shadow over trading floors too: A classic reaction in the markets to the outcome of the French elections. It was widely expected that pro-euro centrist Emmanuel Macron was going to become the new President of France and that he would beat the euro-sceptic Marine Le Pen by a wide margin. And so it proved. Given that possibility, Friday\u2019s sharp moves in some markets - including the DAX future, which surged disproportionately higher - looked bizarre to me. Unsurprisingly, the German index has been quick to undo that move at the start of this week as speculators sold their bullish positions, some at healthy profits. The appetite for risk has fallen further at the start of this week because there has been further evidence of a slowing Chinese economy. After the weakness in manufacturing PMIs, the latest trade figures for April, released overnight, have revealed a sharp slowdown in exports growth to 13.4% from 22.3% year-over-year while imports have also weakened. Rating agency Fitch has also opined on the French election, and like Moody\u2019s it believes Macron faces a tough battle. They point to the relatively low turnout, and the high number of abstentions (more than voted for Le Pen!), adding: A challenge for the incoming administration will be to address the concerns that have led to rising support for populist and Eurosceptic parties, such as high unemployment (around 10% in France versus 4% for \u2018AA\u2019 peers), while enacting potentially unpopular economic and fiscal reforms and maintaining a commitment to EU integration. Emmanuel Macron\u2019s economic vision includes tax and spending cuts, deficit reduction, a shrinking civil service and a deregulated labour market. All things which might prove unpopular with sections of French society, judging by past history. This chart, via economist Fred Ducrozet, has more details: There\u2019s another reason for the lacklustre market reaction today - a stronger European economy could lead the European Central Bank to tighten monetary policy sooner. The ECB has been pumping billions of euros into the eurozone economy for a few years now, through its bond-buying stimulus programme. Inflation has now picked up, and growth prospects look more appealing....so investors face the prospect that the tap of cheap money could be turned down. Larry Hatheway, chief economist at Swiss asset manager GAM, has a good take: Although [ECB president Mario] Draghi has clearly and forcefully defended the ECB\u2019s current accommodative stance, that view is drawing more attention and criticism given improved eurozone economic performance, reduced financial tensions and, perhaps now, less political risk. Any hints the ECB is contemplating a shift to a neutral bias could provide the impetus for the next rise in global bond yields, a narrowing of spreads between US and eurozone bond yields, and a stronger euro.\u201d The euro continues to slide back from last night\u2019s highs, and is now down over half a cent. Back in the UK, there are fresh signs that the once-buoyant property market is cooling. Halifax has reported that prices fell by 0.1% in April. That took the average price down to \u00a3219,649, in April from December\u2019s record high of \u00a3222,190. Separate data has shown that London rents are falling, as increased supply and tighter household budgets bite: In an encouraging signal for Europe, investor confidence across the eurozone has hit its highest level in almost a decade. Research group Sentix\u2019s monthly measure of investor morale jumped to 27.4 in May, sharply up on April\u2019s 23.9. The survey took place from May 4th to 6th, and shows that anxiety over political instability was already waning ahead of Sunday\u2019s election. As Sentix puts it: \u201cInvestors are obviously expecting a decrease in political uncertainties in the euro zone.\u201d Credit rating agency Moody\u2019s reckons Emmanuel Macron\u2019s economic plan should be positive for France\u2019s credit rating, which is currently just Aa2, the third-highest rating available. However, Moody\u2019s is also worried that France could face five years of \u201cpolicy drift\u201d, if the next president struggles to win support for his policies. In a report just released, Sarah Carlson, a Moody\u2019s Senior Vice President, says: \u201cThe ability of France\u2019s policymakers to design, and successfully implement, policies which enhance growth and support fiscal consolidation over time will drive the trajectory of France\u2019s rating and outlook over the medium-term. The new president will face tests in all of these areas.\u201d France\u2019s general government debt is nearly 100% of GDP and is unlikely to decline materially before the end of this decade, Moody\u2019s warning. It also fears that the country\u2019s growth potential is \u201crelatively weak, with trend growth unlikely to be above 1.5%, without significant growth-enhancing reforms\u201d. Trevor Greetham, Head of Multi Asset at Royal London Asset Management, agrees that Macron\u2019s victory has brought relief rather than jubilation to the financial world. \u201cMarkets would have been seriously upset by a Le Pen win, which could have called into question the integrity of the Euro area, setting off financial strains that would make Brexit look like a walk in the park. \u201cMacron\u2019s first challenge is to attract political backing, to form a government that allows him to implement the reforms France needs, in order to bring down unemployment and solidify support for the European project. However, June\u2019s parliamentary elections don\u2019t carry the same near term risks for financial markets as the presidential election. Investors around the globe will be relieved that the eurozone\u2019s second largest economy isn\u2019t being handed to an anti-establishment candidate like Marine Le Pen, says Jaisal Pastakia, Investment Manager at Heartwood Investment Management. So why aren\u2019t markets really roaring? Two reasons, I think. One is that shares have risen since the first round of Presidential voting, in which Macron came first. Anyone who went long on French shares earlier this year is sitting on a decent profit, and may be tempted to bank it. The second is that En Marche! may not win sufficient seats in the French assembly to give Macron an easy ride. Pastakia says: \u201cEmmanuel Macron has won convincingly against Marine Le Pen in this weekend\u2019s election. In anticipation of a Macron victory following the first round two weeks ago, European equities have bounced and the euro has rallied against the major currencies. Much was priced into markets before the event, but we remain positive on a medium term view. Of course, questions remain around what Macron can actually achieve over the longer term. A lot will depend on the outcome of the parliamentary elections in June and the mandate he can secure. The risk is France gets a fragmented parliament. And here\u2019s more City reaction: The euro has also lost its oomph, and has just dropped 0.4% to $1.096, away from last night\u2019s six-month high. Darren Ruane, Head of Fixed Interest at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, suspects that some traders are banking their winnings. \u201cGiven that Macron\u2019s election win was fully expected by markets, early price movements show a small degree of profit-taking. Market, eh? After a brief Macron bounce, the main European indices have all now dipped into the red. And after hitting that post-crisis high, France\u2019s CAC 40 has dropped back. Investors are certainly not spooked by the election result -- but some are expressing concern about Macron\u2019s ability to deliver. Oxford Economics, for example, say: Emmanuel Macron\u2019s landslide victory shows French voters acknowledged that leaving the euro will not solve the economy\u2019s problems. However, Le Pen\u2019s still strong showing shows how Macron has just five years to turn France around. His programme can put France back on a path of stronger growth, but he may only get a small majority in June\u2019s parliamentary elections. The Paris stock market is open...and France\u2019s main stock market index has hit a new nine and a half-year high. The CAC 40 inched up by 0.2% to its highest level since the financial crisis struck almost a decade ago. Bank shares are leading the rally, with Credit Agricole and Societe Generale both gaining ground. But it\u2019s a fairly muted reaction to Macron\u2019s win -- partly because investors had expected it (so it was largely \u2018priced in\u2019). Nicholas Brooks, Head of Economic and Investment Research at asset manager Intermediate Capital Group (ICG) says Macron\u2019s win is clearly good for Europe; politicians now need to take advantage of it. \u201cMacron\u2019s win was not unexpected but it will add to already improving sentiment towards Europe as economic and earnings results have surprised on the upside in the early months of 2017. The focus now will be on whether the EU can take advantage of the recent positive political and economic momentum to tackle some of the fundamental issues that have contributed to the structural problems facing the region and the rise of the populists.\u201d My colleague Alexandra Topping is covering all the latest French political action here: Investors are piling into French government bonds this morning, driving down Paris\u2019s borrowing costs. Reuters has the details: The premium investors demand to hold 10-year French government debt over German equivalents tightened to its lowest since early November after centrist Emmanuel Macron won the French presidency on Sunday. European leaders hailed the victory of Macron as a vote for European unity and a blow to political forces that had sought to build on last year\u2019s Brexit vote to tear apart the European Union. France\u2019s 10-year borrowing costs dropped at the open on Monday, and the spread over German 10-year government bond yields fell to 32.7 basis points in early trade, its lowest since November 10. Here\u2019s our news story about how the euro reacted to Macron\u2019s win: Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory has spared world stock markets from a major crash. But many analysts are already pondering the challenge faced by the 39-year old president-elect. Fidelity International\u2019s global economist, Anna Stupnytska, fears the En Marche! movement could struggle to deliver all its pledges. I expect Macron to manage the Presidency in a pragmatic way, pushing through some--if not all--reform, which should still be beneficial for France\u2019s growth potential. Outside of domestic policies, Macron is clearly pro-EU which boosts the prospect for further eurozone integration, particularly if Martin Schulz replaces Angela Merkel as Chancellor in September. But even here, pragmatism is likely to prevail with a different, more flexible model of the EU likely emerging over the next few years. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets reckons the euro could have slumped by 10% if Marine Le Pen had won. Instead we have stability, but plenty of hurdles ahead. The Frexit goblin will remain locked up as Macron takes the reins. French voters have clearly expelled the populist surge which resulted in Brexit and carried Donald Trump to the White House. Hopes are really high and Macron will have to deliver. Risk of failure in delivering higher growth and lower unemployment is going to be the focal point and it is in this manner that all eyes will now turn towards the June parliamentary elections. Macron needs to make sure that he has a strong hand in the parliament which will help him to make swift movements. The unemployment rate in the country remains stuck at 10 percent, greater than that of the UK and Germany, so it clear that the country needs critical reform. Macron\u2019s next test is the French national assembly elections in June. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets thinks they could be \u201canother ball game\u201d for Macron, as he won\u2019t simply have to be more appealing than Le Pen. While politicians in Europe let out a collective sigh of relief what the result can\u2019t disguise is the level of voter dissatisfaction in France as a whole, given that nearly half the French electorate still voted for parties who ran on an anti-globalisation ticket. Knowing all of this the new French President may well find that winning was the easy bit. It\u2019s all well and good running on a ticket of cutting 120,000 public sector jobs, a \u20ac60bn cut in public spending and a lowering of the unemployment rate to 7%, it will be another getting it through the French parliament. Financial journalist Katie Pilbeam is already looking to 2022: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The markets have a spring in the step this morning after Emmanuel Macron notched up a famous victory for the pro-European centre-ground against the populist far-right. Japan\u2019s stock market has hit a 17-month high, jumping by 2%, as a relief rally swept Asia. We\u2019re now expecting solid gains in Europe too. France\u2019s CAC 40 is tipped to jump by 1% when trading begins soon, and it could hit a new nine-year high. Macron\u2019s victory means that investors can stop worrying that France might quit the euro or exit the European Union - both possible if Marine Le Pen had beaten him to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital captures the mood: \u201cMarkets are set for a buoyant start to the week after Emmanuel Macron eased to a widely-predicted election. Not only the victory but the scale of it should help deliver a significant boost to sentiment on Monday morning, even if turnout was quite low. The result sends a loud signal to investors that political risks in France and across Europe are receding and that is undoubtedly supportive of European equities and the euro. But the relief is a little limited. Macron has the most powerful job in France; now he faces one of the trickiest tasks in European politics, to reform its economy, drive down unemployment, comply with the EU\u2019s budget deficit rules, and generate growth. All in the shadow of populism, with Le Pen already vowing to rebrand her movement. The euro hit a six-month high of $1.1022 last night when the scale of Macron\u2019s victory -- 65% to 35% -- became clear. But it\u2019s since fallen back to $1.098, as investors ponder the scale of the challenge ahead. Macron has already vowed to deliver, as my colleague Angelique Chrisafis reported from Paris: Addressing thousands of supporters in the grand courtyard of the Louvre, the vast Paris palace-turned-museum, Macron said he would defend France and Europe. He said Europe and the world are \u201cwatching us\u201d and \u201cwaiting for us to defend the spirit of the Enlightenment, threatened in so many places\u201d. He promised to unite a divided and fractured France, saying: \u201cI will do everything to make sure you never have reason again to vote for extremes.\u201d Speaking of his meteoric rise and victory that was not forecast even a year ago, he said: \u201cEveryone said it was impossible. But they didn\u2019t know France!\u201d Also coming up today The French election is the main topic of conversation today, but the City will also be looking at some economic data including: 7am BST: German factory orders data 8.30am BST: Halifax\u2019s UK house price index for April 9.30am: Sentix eurozone investor confidence report We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

But even here, pragmatism is likely to prevail with a different, more flexible model of the EU likely emerging over the next few years.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Naeem Aslam</strong> of <strong>Think Markets</strong> reckons the euro could have slumped by 10% if Marine Le Pen had won. Instead we have stability, but plenty of hurdles ahead.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Frexit goblin will remain locked up as Macron takes the reins. French voters have clearly expelled the populist surge which resulted in Brexit and carried Donald Trump to the White House. </p> <p>Hopes are really high and Macron will have to deliver. Risk of failure in delivering higher growth and lower unemployment is going to be the focal point and it is in this manner that all eyes will now turn towards the June parliamentary elections. Macron needs to make sure that he has a strong hand in the parliament which will help him to make swift movements. The unemployment rate in the country remains stuck at 10 percent, greater than that of the UK and Germany, so it clear that the country needs critical reform.</p> </blockquote> <p>Macron\u2019s next test is the French national assembly elections in June.</p> <p><strong>Michael Hewson</strong> of <strong>CMC Markets</strong> thinks they could be \u201canother ball game\u201d for Macron, as he won\u2019t simply have to be more appealing than Le Pen.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While politicians in Europe let out a collective sigh of relief what the result can\u2019t disguise is the level of voter dissatisfaction in France as a whole, given that nearly half the French electorate still voted for parties who ran on an anti-globalisation ticket. </p> <p>Knowing all of this the new French President may well find that winning was the easy bit. It\u2019s all well and good running on a ticket of cutting 120,000 public sector jobs, a \u20ac60bn cut in public spending and a lowering of the unemployment rate to 7%, it will be another getting it through the French parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p>Financial journalist <strong>Katie Pilbeam</strong> is already looking to 2022:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KatiePilbeamTV/status/861468944024162305\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pressure on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MacronPresident?src=hash\">#MacronPresident</a> now to reduce 10% jobless rate, create growth and control his government otherwise Le Pen will be back in 5 yrs</p>&mdash; Katie Pilbeam (@KatiePilbeamTV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatiePilbeamTV/status/861468944024162305\">May 8, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59100586e4b0df096d259045\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-08T06:31:21.421Z\">7.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Introduction: Macron victory cheers investors</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>The markets have a spring in the step this morning after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/07/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-presidency-marine-le-pen\">Emmanuel Macron notched up a famous victory for the pro-European centre-ground against the populist far-right</a>.</p> <p>Japan\u2019s stock market has hit a 17-month high, jumping by 2%, as a relief rally swept Asia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidInglesTV/status/861437626561085440\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Good morning EMEA!<br>Asia risk-on post-Macron victory. <br>Japan reopens - on track for best session in 3 months. <br>China falls (trade data miss) <a href=\"https://t.co/bcHM2KIyFg\">pic.twitter.com/bcHM2KIyFg</a></p>&mdash; David Ingles (@DavidInglesTV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidInglesTV/status/861437626561085440\">May 8, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>We\u2019re now expecting solid gains in Europe too. <strong>France\u2019s CAC 40 is tipped to jump by 1% when trading begins soon, and it could hit a new nine-year high.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/861457513962553344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our European opening calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag\">$FTSE</a> 7333 +0.49%<br>$DAX\u00a012842 +0.99%<br>$CAC\u00a05494 +1.13%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag\">$IBEX</a> 11238 +0.92%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIB&amp;src=ctag\">$MIB</a> 21710 +1.05%</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/861457513962553344\">May 8, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Macron\u2019s victory means that investors can stop worrying that France might quit the euro or exit the European Union - both possible if Marine Le Pen had beaten him to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.</p> <p><strong>Neil Wilson</strong> of <strong>ETX Capital </strong>captures the mood:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cMarkets are set for a buoyant start to the week after Emmanuel Macron eased to a widely-predicted election.

      "bodyText": "British Gas owner Centrica has warned that the Conservative party\u2019s plans to cap energy bills could push up average prices, as the company haemorrhaged customers at a rate that would see it lose a million by the end of the year. Although Centrica was the only one of the big six energy suppliers not to put up its tariffs this winter, Britain\u2019s biggest energy firm still lost 261,000 customers to competitors in the first quarter of 2017. The fall comes on top of the 400,000 customers British Gas lost last year, taking it below 14 million UK residential customers for the first time since the 1970s. Mark Todd, co-founder of switching site Energyhelpline, said the supplier was shedding customers because its prices were not competitive. \u201cBritish Gas have kept their standard prices much lower than the rest of the big six but even so this has still seen them lose quarter of a million customers in the first three months of trading \u2013 ultimately because there are much cheaper tariffs available for switchers.\u201d He predicted that in June the company would announce a 5-10% increase in its standard variable tariff that would affect millions in August. In a trading update before its AGM later on Monday, Centrica said the homes it supplies in the US and UK had used less energy than normal because of above average temperatures this year. The company, which has a sizeable power generation arm, said it had taken a financial hit from wholesale prices falling since its preliminary results in February. Its North Sea gas storage plant has also been closed temporarily over safety concerns. However, Centrica still earned the highest profit margins in the sector on its customers last year, at 8.8% of earnings before interest and tax, versus an industry average of 5.6%, according to new analysis. Lazarus Research found gross profit margins across the sector were the highest on record, which it said would \u201cprovide ammunition to the government on why a cap is needed\u201d. British Gas\u2019s parent company reiterated its call for the next government to resist imposing price caps on the standard variable tariffs that two-thirds of people are on. The Tories have promised their cap will save the average family \u00a3100 a year. Labour is expected to announce a similar policy. \u201cCentrica does not believe in any form of price regulation. Evidence from other countries would suggest this will lead to reduced competition and choice, and potentially higher average prices,\u201d the company said. The \u00a34.15m pay package for Iain Conn, Centrica\u2019s chief executive, came in for repeated criticism from shareholders at the AGM but was defended by the company\u2019s chairman. \u201cIt\u2019s a competitive market and whether you like it or not we have to compete for the best person,\u201d said Rick Haythornthwaite. Shareholders also railed at the state of the company\u2019s share price, which closed up by 2% at \u00a32.02 but remains down from \u00a32.30 last October. Conn said he shared the sentiment, and blamed the repeated threat of intervention by the government. \u201cThere is only one factor driving [the share price] to where it is, and that is the uncertainty about what the Conservative government might do to the energy supply market.\u201d Conn also raised the spectre of accelerating the company\u2019s cost-cutting plan to cope with the hundreds of millions of pounds staff analysts predict a price cap will cost Centrica. The chief executive said he could not rule out increases to the 1,500 job cuts already planned for 2017, in response to a cap, and added that most of the financial impact would be felt in 2018, not 2017. British Gas had been talking to the government about alternatives to a cap, Conn said, such as scrapping standard variable tariffs in favour of a product that needs renewing annually. A similar proposal was put forward recently by Scottish Power, but a consumer group said it amounted to little more than a rebrand of standard variable tariffs. Conn said he was also lobbying government to stop paying subsidies for low carbon power through energy bills, and support such \u201cnecessary\u201d projects through general taxation. John Penrose, a Conservative MP who has led calls for a relative price cap, said Centrica\u2019s warnings of higher prices were an empty threat. \u201cIt isn\u2019t sustainable for the big six to threaten they\u2019ll scrap their cheapest tariffs. They would condemn themselves to a slow commercial death, milking a declining customer base because they wouldn\u2019t win any new business.\u201d Analysts were divided over the impact of political intervention for Centrica. The Royal Bank of Canada noted that \u201cpolitical headwinds\u201d had hurt Centrica\u2019s share price, and described the trading update as negative. \u201cDespite significant upside potential opening up to our price target, we would continue to avoid the name until there is better visibility on the competitive retail environment in the UK,\u201d experts at the bank said. However, Hargreaves Lansdown said that its guidance on the company remained unchanged, given the progress on its strategic targets. \u201cLong-term investors will be familiar with the tricks the weather and energy prices can play on Centrica\u2019s profits, and will already be aware that recent trends in customer growth have been negative,\u201d the investment group\u2019s analysts said. Comparison sites said that since Theresa May threatened to take action against energy suppliers in her 2016 party conference speech, tariffs had risen. Uswitch found the cheapest tariff among the biggest suppliers was \u00a31,001.26 on 1 May, up from \u00a3836.21 on 1 October 2016.",

Evidence from other countries would suggest this will lead to reduced competition and choice, and potentially higher average prices,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>The \u00a34.15m pay package for Iain Conn, Centrica\u2019s chief executive, came in for repeated criticism from shareholders at the AGM but was defended by the company\u2019s chairman. \u201cIt\u2019s a competitive market and whether you like it or not we have to compete for the best person,\u201d said Rick Haythornthwaite.</p> <p>Shareholders also railed at the state of the company\u2019s share price, which closed up by 2% at \u00a32.02 but remains down from \u00a32.30 last October. Conn said he shared the sentiment, and blamed the repeated threat of intervention by the government.</p> <p>\u201cThere is only one factor driving [the share price] to where it is, and that is the uncertainty about what the Conservative government might do to the energy supply market.\u201d</p> <p>Conn also raised the spectre of accelerating the company\u2019s cost-cutting plan to cope with the hundreds of millions of pounds staff analysts predict a price cap will cost Centrica. The chief executive said he could not rule out increases to the 1,500 job cuts already planned for 2017, in response to a cap, and added that most of the financial impact would be felt in 2018, not 2017.</p> <p>British Gas had been talking to the government about alternatives to a cap, Conn said, such as scrapping standard variable tariffs in favour of a product that needs renewing annually. A similar proposal was put forward recently by Scottish Power, but a consumer group said it amounted to little more than a rebrand of standard variable tariffs.</p> <p>Conn said he was also lobbying government to stop paying subsidies for low carbon power through energy bills, and support such \u201cnecessary\u201d projects through general taxation.</p> <p>John Penrose, a Conservative MP who has led calls for a relative price cap, said Centrica\u2019s warnings of higher prices were an empty threat. \u201cIt isn\u2019t sustainable for the big six to threaten they\u2019ll scrap their cheapest tariffs. They would condemn themselves to a slow commercial death, milking a declining customer base because they wouldn\u2019t win any new business.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts were divided over the impact of political intervention for Centrica. The Royal Bank of Canada noted that \u201cpolitical headwinds\u201d had <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/24/conservative-energy-bill-cap-dents-company-share-prices\">hurt Centrica\u2019s share price</a>, and described the trading update as negative. \u201cDespite significant upside potential opening up to our price target, we would continue to avoid the name until there is better visibility on the competitive retail environment in the UK,\u201d experts at the bank said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/08/octopus-energy-tariff-customers-see-profit-margins-gas-electricity\">What's our cut?

But the offer for the Anglo-Dutch maker of Marmite, Flora and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s was abandoned only 48 hours later \u2013 when Kraft Heinz gave up on its chances of pulling off the second-largest corporate deal in history. The Brazilian buyout house is well known for its approach to cutting costs but the 86-year-old Buffett told CNBC that 3G was just trying to make the businesses it owned more efficient. \u201cThey have followed the standard capitalist formula ... of trying to do the same business with fewer people,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cPeople live better when there is more output per capita.\u201d Often dubbed the \u201cSage of Omaha\u201d because of his ability to make lucrative investments, Buffett said \u201cit\u2019s a defect of mine\u201d that he was not more focused on efficiency in his own businesses.

At the time, the marriage of the two companies raised fears for the workforce because of the ruthless approach 3G took when it controlled Heinz \u2013 replacing 11 of the 12 top bosses and cutting thousands of jobs. Buffett was speaking to CNBC after his annual meeting at the weekend of shareholders in Berkshire Hathway, which owns stakes in a wide range of companies including Coca-Cola, IBM, Apple and Wells Fargo. At the meeting in Omaha, to which thousands of Berkshire Hathway\u2019s shareholders flock each year to what is sometimes dubbed \u201cthe Woodstock of capitalism\u201d, he had said \u201cit is absolutely essential to America that we become more productive\u201d. His remarks on 3G coincided with a pledge by the Brazilian group to avoid making hostile bids on target companies. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to go anywhere that we are not welcome by shareholders in order to do a deal,\u201d Alex Behring, 3G\u2019s co-founder, told the Financial Times.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A challenger energy firm is hoping to win back consumer trust in the industry with the launch of a tariff that shows how much profit it is making from households. Octopus Energy said its new deal would use an app to display the profit margins it made on an account, alongside the wholesale prices it paid for electricity and gas. The big six energy suppliers \u2013 British Gas, EDF, E.ON, Npower, Scottish Power and SSE \u2013 have been criticised for being slow to pass on falling wholesale costs, while being swift to impose rising prices on customers. Npower blamed wholesale prices when it announced the biggest increase in the recent round of price hikes, but the industry regulator, Ofgem, has said the rises have been hard to justify. Greg Jackson, founder and chief executive of Octopus, which has attracted 90,000 customers since launching a year ago, said he expected transparency to become an increasingly important selling point. \u201cThe debate over price rises \u2013 where the regulator is saying there is no justification for them and the big six are saying there\u2019s no choice \u2013 it\u2019s hard for people to know what\u2019s true,\u201d he said. \u201cThis tariff is the first guarantee that you won\u2019t get ripped off.\u201d The cost of the dual fuel tariff \u2013 for electricity and gas \u2013 would be about \u00a3907 a year based on Friday\u2019s wholesale prices, compared with the \u00a31,044 to \u00a31,160 the big six suppliers are charging customers on the most commonly used deals. The Octopus price will change daily to reflect how much the company is paying to buy electricity and gas from the market. The app will show the profit margin the firm is making, which it expects to be about 10% rather than the 30% the bigger suppliers make. While Jackson said it was unlikely most customers would want to track the price daily, the supplier would be publishing its figures as an open source formula, allowing customers to \u201clook very closely\u201d and hold the company to account. The arrival of smart meters, which measure energy usage exactly and will be fitted in every home by the end of 2020, would make the cost breakdown even more accurate and \u201cput us on steroids\u201d, Jackson said. \u201cAt moment, we are on estimated consumption; in a smart meter world we\u2019re using actual consumption.\u201d The consumer group Which? said it was the first product it was aware of that tracked prices on a daily basis. This week will also see the debut of one of the biggest new entrants into the UK energy market for several years. Engie, a French energy giant, started supplying UK homes with electricity and gas this year but is yet to release customer numbers. The firm, a major gas supplier in Europe, will announce a new deal that will also promise greater transparency. Energy prices and the overcharging of millions of customers have risen up the political agenda in recent months, driven by five of the big six companies raising prices. Ministers have promised \u201cstrong and muscular\u201d action to rein in energy costs and the Conservatives have promised to cap standard tariffs, which could save millions of families \u00a3100 if they are re-elected in June. The pledge saw shares at UK-listed the SSE and British Gas owner Centrica slide last week. Analysts at the investment bank Jefferies said they expected SSE to take an 8% hit to its earnings before interest and tax in 2018-19, and a 20% reduction for Centrica. While the Conservative party has focused on price caps, the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos are expected to place a strong emphasis on the need for improving the efficiency of Britain\u2019s homes, which are some of the draughtiest in Europe.",

The app will show the profit margin the firm is making, which it expects to be about 10% rather than the 30% the bigger suppliers make.</p> <p>While Jackson said it was unlikely most customers would want to track the price daily, the supplier would be publishing its figures as an open source formula, allowing customers to \u201clook very closely\u201d and hold the company to account.</p> <p>The arrival of smart meters, which measure energy usage exactly and will be fitted in every home by the end of 2020, would make the cost breakdown even more accurate and \u201cput us on steroids\u201d, Jackson said. \u201cAt moment, we are on estimated consumption; in a smart meter world we\u2019re using actual consumption.\u201d</p> <p>The consumer group Which? said it was the first product it was aware of that tracked prices on a daily basis.</p> <p>This week will also see the debut of one of the biggest new entrants into the UK energy market for several years. Engie, a French energy giant, started supplying UK homes with electricity and gas this year but is yet to release customer numbers. The firm, a major gas supplier in Europe, will announce a new deal that will also promise greater transparency. </p> <p>Energy prices and the overcharging of millions of customers have risen up the political agenda in recent months, driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/13/how-to-beat-uk-energy-price-rises-reduce-bills-switch-capping\">five of the big six companies raising prices</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/19/greg-clark-promises-decisive-action-to-rein-in-uk-energy-companies\">Ministers have promised \u201cstrong and muscular\u201d action to rein in energy costs</a> and the Conservatives have promised to cap standard tariffs, which could save millions of families \u00a3100 if they are re-elected in June. </p> <p>The pledge saw shares at UK-listed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/24/conservative-energy-bill-cap-dents-company-share-prices\">SSE and British Gas owner Centrica slide</a> last week. Analysts at the investment bank Jefferies said they expected SSE to take an 8% hit to its earnings before interest and tax in 2018-19, and a 20% reduction for Centrica.</p> <p>While the Conservative party has focused on price caps, the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos are expected to place a strong emphasis on the need for improving the efficiency of Britain\u2019s homes, which are some of the draughtiest in Europe.</p> <p></p> <p></p>",

      "bodyText": "Slower economic growth and higher inflation present Bank of England policymakers with a delicate balancing act when they meet this week to set interest rates and agree new forecasts for the UK as it goes through an election and Brexit talks. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) is widely expected to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25% to offer continued support to the economy and the jobs market. Economists forecast that just one policymaker, Kristin Forbes, will vote for a rate rise, sticking to the position she adopted at the last meeting in March amid worries about inflation picking up too fast. The rest will opt to leave policy unchanged, according to a Reuters poll of City economists. Alongside its decision on Thursday, the Bank will publish updated forecasts in its quarterly \u201cinflation report\u201d, incorporating a host of new developments since its last outlook in February. Compared with that previous report, inflation has been higher than the Bank predicted and growth has been lower as squeezed consumers rein in spending. On top of that, the government has officially opened Brexit negotiations with the rest of the EU and called a snap general election for June. \u201cThe MPC will have to acknowledge that it is confronted with a slightly more difficult trade-off for policy-setting than previously, but we don\u2019t foresee a change from its core neutral stance,\u201d said Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets. Hill and other economists said policymakers could use this week\u2019s report to nudge down their 2% forecast for GDP growth in 2017, after the year got off to a slow start. Nomura analyst George Buckley expects the Bank to signal it is in no hurry to move borrowing costs from the low they were cut to after last summer\u2019s Brexit vote. \u201cWith economic surprises having been negative in recent weeks, the Bank looks to be in wait-and-see mode at the moment,\u201d said Buckley. He is forecasting interest rates will stay on hold through to the end of Mark Carney\u2019s time as governor in June 2019. But after business surveys last week signalled the economy may have enjoyed a rebound in April, there was a risk that further positive news on growth and higher-than-expected inflation could prompt an earlier rate rise, Buckley added. The outlook for interest rates this year is also clouded by upcoming changes on the MPC. One seat is currently empty, reducing it to eight people for this week\u2019s decision, after deputy governor Charlotte Hogg resigned when it emerged she had breached the Bank\u2019s code of conduct. Hogg has yet to be replaced and another position becomes free at the end of June when Forbes\u2019 stint on the committee comes to an end. Weighing up how the eight policymakers at this week\u2019s meeting will vote, Victoria Clarke, an economist at Investec, noted that minutes from the March meeting in March showed worries about inflation went beyond Forbes. The rest of the committee also appeared to be more open to considering tighter policy, she said. \u201cThe minutes had a more hawkish tone that spread beyond just Forbes\u2019s vote. They noted that \u2018some members\u2019 were of the opinion that it would not take much more upside news to justify considering tightening policy, particularly \u2018on the prospects for activity or inflation\u2019,\u201d Clarke said. But she expects the committee to edge back towards a more neutral stance this week, reflecting news of slower growth, weaker consumer spending, softening in the housing market and a pick-up in the pound. The currency\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote has stoked inflation by raising the cost of imports to the UK. Its partial recovery since February could ease some of that upward pressure on prices. Kallum Pickering, a senior UK economist at the bank Berenberg, sees a case for rates rising sooner than the market is pricing in. He highlighted how the economy had confounded commentators\u2019 gloomy forecasts for a post-referendum slump. \u201cWhile downside risks to near-term demand from Brexit uncertainty and rising inflation should be watched carefully, almost a year of data shows that these risks have failed to materialise in any serious way,\u201d said Pickering. Berenberg is forecasting a rate rise to 0.5% in the first quarter of 2018, with a 40% chance of it coming in 2017. \u201cIf the Bank of England waits too long it could fall behind the curve, and may face the prospect of hiking faster than would be desirable to try to bring inflation under control, and in doing so causing the negative demand shock that led to its cautiousness to begin with,\u201d said Pickering. Paul Hollingsworth at the consultancy Capital Economics also thinks the first rate rise will come before markets expect. \u201cIf we are right in thinking that the economy will hold up fairly well this year \u2026 and that growth remains solid next year, rather than slows as the consensus expects, then the MPC should be in a position to begin normalising rates in 2018, much sooner than most expect,\u201d he said.",

The analysis by legal firm Freshfields found, however, that fewer City jobs may move to other financial centres than might have been expected following the triggering of article 50 \u2013 the formal process of leaving the EU \u2013 in March. Commissioned by the lobby group TheCityUK, the report said: \u201cThere is a general view across impacted businesses that the two-year period for negotiating the UK\u2019s exit arrangement provided for by article 50 will not be long enough either for the UK government to redefine its ongoing relationship with the EU or for firms to satisfactorily effect any required reorganisation and restructuring. \u201cFirms are applying a base case of Brexit in two years from March 2017 (ie, the point at which the article 50 notice was served) with no equivalence and no special passporting or access rights agreed. If signalled early in the negotiations, a phased implementation period would be of mutual benefit to the EU and the UK.\u201d The lawyers at Freshfields did not consider whether the UK would be able to maintain \u201cpassporting\u201d rights \u2013 the means by which firms can operate across the current 28 member EU borders \u2013 because they believe this is not politically viable after Theresa May\u2019s speech in January ruling out membership of the single market. A number of senior City figures have called for a transitional period after the UK leaves the EU in 2019 to avoid disruption. Firms have also started to give details in public about how they might tackle the situation and the Bank of England has told firms to provide it with details of their Brexit plans by 14 July and to ready for all possible outcomes, including a hard Brexit. US bank JP Morgan is preparing to move up to 1,000 bankers out of the City to Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg. Goldman Sachs has said it would need more people in Madrid, Milan, Paris and other EU centres and its boss Lloyd Blankfein said last week that Brexit would \u201cstall\u201d the City\u2019s growth. The Freshfield analysis found, though, that \u201cfirms want to keep as many of their activities in the UK as possible within the confines of regulatory and operational considerations\u201d. They concluded that one single EU member state would not benefit and that firms would react differently depending on how they were currently structured. James Smethurst, a partner at Freshfields, said that the plans could require fewer staff moves that might have been expected, but the report does not contain any forecasts. One estimate puts the job loss at 230,000 across the entire UK\u2019s financial services sector, not just the City. Miles Celic, TheCityUK\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe UK-based financial and related professional services industry has long been a driver of growth and job creation on both sides of the Channel. It is in our common interest that this role is not just preserved, but promoted\u201d.",
