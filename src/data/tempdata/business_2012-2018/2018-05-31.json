      "bodyText": "The parliamentary inquiry into the franchise sector has been handed a \u201cchilling\u201d succession of similar stories by small-business owners who claim franchisors suggested they should steal wages from vulnerable workers. Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neill, who is deputy chair of the committee investigating franchising, told Guardian Australia the inquiry would need to look at how franchise business practices encouraged the exploitation of workers. In a published submission to the inquiry, a former Muffin Break franchisee, Faheem Mirza, said he was told \u201cto consider underpaying staff that I can trust\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon \u201cThe key message was that as migrants, I must be aware of other migrants or students who would gladly accept underpayments in lure of their first job and hence not report or complain,\u201d Mizra said. \u201cSo, if I were able to exploit my employees I could generate a profit. Otherwise there is no other cost that can be managed enough to reverse this loss-making scenario.\u201d Foodco, the franchise operation that owns the Muffin Break brand, said it \u201cstrongly refutes this false allegation\u201d. Another small business owner, from a different franchise group, told Guardian Australia he was advised by an associate of the franchisor that he should exploit staff on 457 visas by demanding kickbacks. The business owner said he was later told by his staff that a wages rort \u2013 which involved paying foreign workers the standard rate, then demanding a portion be returned in cash \u2013 had been in place before he bought the business. \u201cThe whole suggestion was that we could get away with it, because they wouldn\u2019t speak out. We just said: \u2018We won\u2019t do that,\u2019 \u201d he said. O\u2019Neill said there had been many confidential submissions to the inquiry and that stories about wage theft were common. Guardian Australia reported last month that many franchisees were afraid to speak publicly because of concern that doing so would violate agreements that were heavily weighted in favour of brand owners. \u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where across the country people are independently putting forward evidence to the committee where they\u2019re too frightened to have their name put to it,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a consistency of storytelling here. They\u2019ve been sold a business model that too often depends on wage theft to make a sustainable business. \u201cThere\u2019s a chilling similarity in the stories. That\u2019s why they have such credibility. They\u2019re doing it confidentially for fear of retribution.\u201d Rob Whittet and Emma Forsyth, from Toowoomba, in Queensland, estimate they lost $2.5m on failed Jamaica Blue franchises licensed by Foodco. \u201cIt\u2019s destroyed everything we had,\u201d Whittet said. \u201cWe lost a property we owned outright. We had an investment property, we\u2019re now living in.\u201d Whittet said the business model he was sold was, in reality, not profitable while paying staff the minimum wage, even when he and Forsyth were working more than 80 hours a week and not drawing a wage. Regardless of whether his business turned a profit, the master franchise always got their cut, because royalty fees were based on turnover. He said franchisors should have a stake in the profitability of businesses, and ensuring that franchisees met their obligations to pay staff and bills, which meant ensuring standard practice was for royalties to be paid based on a percentage of profit, not turnover. Foodco said in a statement: \u201cWe take very seriously our obligations to ensure our franchisees comply in the important area of lawful employment practices. \u201cFar from encouraging this practice of underpayment, in January 2017 Foodco entered into a voluntary partnership with the office of the fair work ombudsman by way of a proactive compliance deed. \u201cWe regularly audit our network to ensure compliance issues are identified and remedied as quickly as possible.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s what you need to know: Our full story on the day\u2019s trade fears is here: After a momentous day on the international trade front, the Dow Jones industrial average closed the session 251 points down as investors sold off shares in manufacturers and corporations with global reach. Other US index were also lower, with the S&amp;P 500 falling for the fourth time in five days. The tariff issue had \u201ccast a pall over the animal spirits,\u201d explained Libby Cantrill, managing director and the head of public policy for PIMCO, on Bloomberg TV. Some investors expressed concerns that trade tariffs could interrupt synchronized global growth. \u201cThe hard thing about protectionism, the hard thing about tariffs and quotas, is that you can almost think of it as it\u2019s a slow moving disease, but it\u2019s deadly,\u201d Kristina Hooper, Invesco\u2019s chief global market strategist, told Bloomberg. \u201cWhen I look at protectionism, I don\u2019t believe the market truly can price it in at this point because there\u2019s still so many potential iterations. But right now it\u2019s certainly moving further to the extremes when it comes to protectionism and that can be very problematic.\u201d That\u2019s code for expect trouble ahead. Thanks for reading \u2013 we\u2019re going to wrap up this blog now. US jobs report on Friday \u2013 stay tuned. South of the border, Mexico\u2019s ministry of economy has also issued a statement, saying it \u201cdeeply regrets and disapproves\u201d the US decision to impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from Mexico as of 1 June but reiterated \u201cits openness to a constructive dialogue with the US\u201d. The statement read in part: \u201cIn response to the decision of the United States to impose tariffs, Mexico will adopt equivalent measures on a variety of products, including flat steel (hot and cold foil, including coated and tubes and pipes), lamps, pork legs and shoulders, sausages and food preparations, apples, grapes, cranberries, various cheeses, and other products, up to an amount comparable to damage caused by the United States\u2019 action. \u201cThis measure will be in force for as long as the US government maintains the imposed tariffs.\u201d Canada\u2019s list of proposed counter measures is here. Freeland concluded her remarks saying: \u201cI want to be very clear about one thing: Americans remain our partners, friends, and allies. This is not about the American people. We have to believe that at some point their common sense will prevail. But we see no sign of that in this action today by the US administration.\u201d Canadian officials said they would impose tariffs against up to C$16.6bn worth of imports of steel, aluminium, whiskey, orange juice and other products from the US. \u201cWe are imposing dollar for dollar tariffs,\u201d said Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister. The tariffs are expected to take effect on 1 July. The tariffs violate Nafta and WTO trade rules, added Freeland, who said that Canada plans to launch dispute settlement proceedings under Nafta Chapter 20 and the WTO. Canada\u2019s foreign minister Chrystia Freeland says Canada will impose retaliatory measures against US steel, aluminium and other products \u2013 but subject to a 15-day consultation. Freeland also said Canada would continue to defend \u201cfree, open rule-based trade\u201d but would also challenge US tariffs under both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Word trade Organisation. Trudeau said the tariffs will harm industries and workers on both sides of the Canada-US border. \u201cThey are an affront to the long-standing security partnership between Canada and the United States, and in particular an affront to the thousands of Canadians who have fought and died alongside their US comrades in arms. The ties of commerce, friendship and in many cases family between Americans and Canadians are undiminished. We are confident that shared values, geography and common interest will ultimately overcome protectionism.\u201d Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau has hit back strongly at the imposition of tariffs, calling them \u201c totally unacceptable\u201d at a news conference. French President Emmanuel Macron said the United States\u2019 decision to impose tariffs on European metals exports is illegal and a mistake. The French leader said he would talk to President Donald Trump on the subject later on Thursday Canada\u2019s prime minister Trudeau and Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto have reportedly spoken and agreed to co-ordinate retaliation efforts... A formal complaint by the EU at the WTO in Geneva is expected tomorrow, Friday. In joint statement the French minister and German finance minister, Bruno la Marie and Peter Altamira, said they regretted the \u201cunilateral decision\u201d taken by the White House and backed the European Commission\u2019s retaliatory response. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is expected to speak at 1.30pm ET. In the meantime, we have Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, who has called Trump a \u201cbully\u201d, describing him as a \u201cman who simply does not seem to get that his bluster and his bullying are costing real people real jobs\u201d. The conservative business network backed by the wealthy industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch has also come out in opposition to the tariffs. Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Prosperity warned there would be a tax increase on all Americans and would undermine the nation\u2019s economy and low unemployment rates. Now for the reaction from Washington\u2026 Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has said the Trump administration is \u201chitting the wrong target\u201d and officials will need to provide answers to Congress about the damage to US businesses. \u201cWhen it comes to unfairly traded steel and aluminum, Mexico, Canada and Europe are not the problem \u2013 China is. These tariffs are hitting the wrong target.\u201d Brady urged the administration to exempt allies from the new import tariffs. And he warned that administration officials \u201cwill need to come to Capitol Hill to provide answers about the indiscriminate harm these tariffs are causing our local businesses\u201d. Continuing the denunciations of the US decision, Germany\u2019s foreign minister Heiko Maas says the European Union \u201cis ready to react accordingly with counter measure\u201d. As Europe prepares to hit back with tariffs on a list of US exports worth \u20ac6.4 billion ($7.5 billion), Mexico\u2019s economy ministry has said it will target several US goods in response, including some steel and pipe products, lamps, berries, grapes, apples, cold cuts, pork chops and various cheese products \u201cup to an amount comparable to the level of damage\u201d linked to the US tariffs. Canada is also expected to impose retaliatory measures, details of which are expected soon. Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), called the US move \u201chugely disappointing\u201d and warned that the tariffs \u201cwill hurt companies and communities in many areas of the UK, as well as their customers in the US\u201d. \u201cThe UK government must reach out to and support the many supply chain businesses that face becoming the \u2018collateral damage\u2019 of the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist push. British ministers must also work hand in hand with the EU to avoid any further escalation, and to find a long-term solution.\u201d But he also warned that the US decision to impose punitive tariffs should serve as a reminder that self-interest looms large in trade negotiations. \u201cMinisters should reflect on this carefully before they pursue any future trade deal between the UK and the USA.\u201d More from Boffey: Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People\u2019s Party, the largest group in the European Parliament, and a key ally of the German chancellor, warned that treating the EU as the \u201cenemy\u201d would lead to US consumers hurting too. He said: \u201cEurope does not want a trade conflict. We believe in a fair trade regime from which everybody benefits. We have tried everything to make dialogue and mutual understanding prevail. If President Trump decides to treat Europe as an enemy, we will have no choice but to defend European industry, European jobs, European interests.\u201d But he warned his party would not accept \u201cthis highly regrettable decision without reacting. This will have consequences for the American people too. In a trade conflict there are only losers.\u201d The situation, he added, \u201chas to be a wake-up call for us Europeans.\u201d \u201cWith the US closing in on itself, we should be bridge-builders and reliable partners for the rest of the world. Europe now has to act with a clear message and remain united, calm and proportionate.\u201d Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, called the US decision \u201ca bad day for the steel sector, for international relations and for free trade.\u201d He said it is vital that the EU and US continue discussions to find a way through the current impasse and reach an agreement that works for all parties. But he called on the EU to forge ahead with safeguard action. And from the Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Jessica Elgot: A UK government spokesman said they were \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the outcome. \u201cThe UK and other European Union countries are close allies of the US and should be permanently and fully exempted from the American measures on steel and aluminium,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe have made clear to the US government at the highest levels the importance of UK steel and aluminium to its businesses and defence projects. We will continue to work closely with the EU and US Administration to achieve a permanent exemption, and to ensure that UK workers are protected and safeguarded.\u201d May will raise the tariffs with Trump directly when the pair meet at the G7 in Canada next week, where the issue is likely to figure prominently. May has personally lobbied the US president repeatedly in recent weeks and months. The Guardian\u2019s Daniel Boffey from Brussels: Brussels has been preparing a retaliatory hit on an array of US goods, both industrial and agricultural, ranging from Harley Davidson motorbikes to blue jeans and American bourbon. Ambassadors from the 28 member states were in immediate communication with the European Commission following the announcement from the Trump administration. Speaking at a conference in Brussels, Juncker said the EU would launch retaliatory action \u201cin the coming hours\u201d. \u201cThis is a bad day for world trade,\u201d Juncker. \u201cIt\u2019s totally unacceptable that a country is imposing unilateral measures when it comes to world trade. What they can do, we are able to do.\u201d Susan Danger, chief executive of the American Chamber of Commerce to the EU (AmCham EU), said the White House did not have any justification for imposing the tariffs. \u201cAmerican companies in Europe oppose the US government\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on EU imports of steel and aluminium. We urge the US government to revisit its plans and the EU to take a balanced approach in responding to these measures. We are very concerned by the damage a tit-for-tat dispute would cause to the transatlantic economy and its impact on jobs, investment and security across the Atlantic.\u201d Mexico\u2019s Undersecretary of Foreign Trade, Juan Carlos Baker, tweeted: Ram\u00f3n Beltr\u00e1n, the president of Mexico\u2019s National Chamber of the Aluminium Industry, told \u2018Aristegui En Vivo\u2019: \u201cNobody will win [the trade war that is beginning]. The US will lose.\u201d \u201cFrankly, we do not like this at all,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n added. Beltr\u00e1n claimed the US move was designed to pressure Mexico over NAFTA negotiations. \u201c[But] we shouldn\u2019t contaminate one thing with the other.\u201d Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Economy said it \u201cprofoundly regretted\u201d the US move and announced it would hit back with tariffs on products including including grapes, apples, pork legs and shoulders, blueberries, some cheeses as well as flat steel. \u201cMexico has repeatedly made clear that these kinds of measures based on national security are neither appropriate nor justified,\u201d the secretariat said in a statement. The former Belgian prime minister, and leader of the liberals in the European Parliament, Guy Verhofstadt, said: \u201cUnfortunately, these steps weaken the transatlantic alliance. Instead of imposing punitive tariffs on their closest allies, the US and EU should work together to tackle China\u2019s unfair trading practices.\u201d He continued: \u201cAs with Brexit, what is most important now is unity within the EU. If we are united, we will have a strong position to face this wave of protectionism, which will benefit no one. The EU has proven to be a strong and reliable global trading partner. In recent months, the EU secured major free trade deals with partners like Canada, Japan and Mexico. This shows what we can achieve when Europe speaks with one voice. We need to continue in this spirit and work with partners around the globe to preserve the rules-based multilateral trading system.\u201d In his statement, EU commission president Juncker said: \u201cI am concerned by this decision. The EU believes these unilateral US tariffs are unjustified and at odds with World Trade Organisation rules. This is protectionism, pure and simple. Over the past months we have continuously engaged with the US at all possible levels to jointly address the problem of overcapacity in the steel sector. Overcapacity remains at the heart of the problem and the EU is not the source of but on the contrary equally hurt by it. US equities fell on the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 250 points. Mexican stocks also fell, while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar hit their lows of the day against the dollar after news of US tariffs broke. Author and historian Simon Schama has also weighed in, posting on Twitter that \u201cEurope now has to show some real spine or else it will just become Trump\u2019s doormat\u201d. The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has issued a statement and commented on Twitter: \u201cIt\u2019s a bad day for world trade. US leaves us no choice but to proceed with a WTO dispute settlement case and the imposition of additional duties on a number of US imports. We will defend the EU\u2019s interests, in full compliance with international trade law.\u201d Markets have edged into negative territory despite earlier rises on hopes of a resolution to the Italian political crisis. The moves came as the US imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Mexico and Canada. Investors are also fretting about other geopolitical problems, including Friday\u2019s vote of no confidence in Spain, the continuing concerns about North Korea and Iran, the prospect of a trade war between the US and China. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is currently down 0.13%, while Spain\u2019s Ibex is 0.2% lower and Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.75%. France\u2019s Cac has managed to edge up 0.03% while the FTSE 100 is 0.18% higher. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 145 points or 0.62%. On the economic front, eurozone inflation came in higher than forecast in May. UK consumer credit rebounded in April, as the City regulator ordered a clampdown on high cost credit. In the US, consumer spending and weekly jobless claims both came in better than expected. Finally, the Bank of England has appointed academic Jonathan Haskel to its rate setting monetary policy committee, the only man on a shortlist of five candidates. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has confirmed that it will impose steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Canada and Mexico from midnight tonight. The tariffs will be 25% for steel and 10% for aluminium. Amid fears of a trade war, Ross said if any party retaliated that did not rule out further negotiations. He said talks with the EU had made progress, but not enough to continue an exemption from tariffs, which was due to expire tomorrow. While European markets are still just about holding onto gains in the hope that Italy can come up with a plausible government after the recent turmoil, Wall Street has opened lower on worries about trade wars. With the US set to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU, Canada and Mexico, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 112 points or 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.28% lower and the Nasdaq Composite has lost 0.08%. Here\u2019s our story on the appointment of the only man on a five person shortlist to the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee: The Bank of England interest rate setting committee, which has only one woman among its nine members, will continue to be male-dominated after the Treasury opted to appoint the only man from a shortlist of five candidates. In a move that immediately sparked protests from women\u2019s groups, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said Jonathan Haskel, an Imperial College economist, would join the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, on the monetary policy committee (MPC) for a three-year term starting in September, when he will succeed the outgoing Ian McCafferty. The Treasury said four women were on the shortlist, but an internal panel made up of two women and one man chose Haskel as the best candidate. Clare Lombardelli, first female chief economic adviser to the Treasury, chaired the panel. She was joined by the former MPC member Kate Barker and Richard Hughes, the Treasury\u2019s director of fiscal policy. A Women\u2019s Equality party (WEP) spokeswoman said the appointment of Haskel sent the wrong message- about the Treasury\u2019s commitment to improving diversity in important areas of public life. \u201cIt suggests that even if they had an all-female shortlist, they would probably still appoint a man,\u201d she said. The full report is here: Shares in troubled Deutsche Bank are down around 5% following reports that US authorities have put its business in the country on a list of troubled institutions. More signs of the strength of the US economy. Weekly jobless claims fell by more than expected, down 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000. Analysts had forecast a fall to 228,000. The jobless rate at 3.9% is a near seventeen and a half year low and close to the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 3.8% by the end of the year. The news comes ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll report, where economists expect around 188,000 jobs to have been created in May. Meanwhile US consumer spending rose by a higher than expected 0.6% last month, the biggest increase in five months. The forecast was for a 0.4% increase. Back in Italy: Meanwhile over in Spain, the no confidence debate is taking place. Our latest report: The future of the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is hanging in the balance as parliament prepares to debate a motion of no-confidence tabled after his Partido Popular (People\u2019s party) was found to have profited from a huge kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. A defiant Rajoy addressed MPs early on Thursday, accusing the opposition Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol (Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party) of opportunism and reminding the PSOE of its corruption scandals. \u201cWith what moral authority are you speaking? Are you perhaps Mother Teresa of Calcutta?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere have been corrupt people in the PP, but the PP is not a corrupt party.\u201d The no-confidence vote, scheduled to take place on Friday, is likely to be very close. The PSOE needs the support of 176 of the 350 MPs in congress of deputies. The votes of the five MPs of the Partido Nacionalista Vasco (Basque Nationalist party) will prove decisive, with the PNV saying it would meet and hear what the PSOE leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, had to say before announcing its decision. S\u00e1nchez called for \u201cdemocratic regeneration\u201d as he sought the backing of MPs, saying: \u201cResign, Mr Rajoy. Your time is up.\u201d The full story is here: With European markets drifting - but mainly still managing to stay in positive territory - Wall Street is expected to open marginally lower. There is an eerie sense of calm after all the ructions caused by the Italian political crisis, with investors hoping a new government can be formed after all without the need for another election campaign. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: Not too long ago, a coalition government in Italy consisting of two eurosceptic populist parties was a feared and unlikely prospect that many believed would majorly concern investors. While much of this remains true, it is also currently viewed as the least unattractive and feasible outcome for markets, with the other alternative being fresh elections and the possibility that the parties are given an even stronger and potentially less euro-friendly mandate. Italy\u2019s President, Sergio Mattarella, may have believed he was acting in the best interest of the country when he rejected to populists choice of Finance Minister but the reality is that in doing so, he has given both parties more ammunition with which to attack the euro. Mattarella has already been accused of acting on behalf of Germany and others while Brussels has been accused of interference, it all feeds very well into the eurosceptics message that the country no longer even has control over its domestic politics. Should the country move straight on to another election, both Five Star Movement and Lega will look to take advantage of any fury linked to perceived meddling and could significantly add to their numbers. All of a sudden, the worst case scenario prior to the election looks tolerable compared to what could come from another. With both parties now in discussions again, there is a hope that the political impasse can be resolved which is helping to lift sentiment in the near-term. That said, a positive outcome now poses many further risks in the long-term. While Italian assets have bore the brunt of the pain from the latest period of political instability and uncertainty, there has been a negative impact on the wider markets including the euro which dropped to a 10-month low against the dollar. While we\u2019re still far away from the days of the debt crisis and the risk of a breakup, a second election was being portrayed as a vote on the euro which seems drastic and probably overhyped but it certainly hit the single currency. Markets are still managing to hold onto their gains - just - on hopes that the Italian political crisis can be resolved before too long. Here is our latest report on the developments: The leader of the Italian far-right party the League, Matteo Salvini, cancelled political rallies to return to Rome early on Thursday, in what was seen as a sign that a weeks-long political impasse that has left the country without a fully-functioning government for months might soon be coming to an end. Salvini was heading back to the capital to meet with his coalition partner, Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, after the Italian president gave the pair more time to form a government. Italian press reports indicated that any agreement to form a new populist government involving the League, formerly known as the Lega Nord, and M5S would include the nomination \u2013 again \u2013 of Giuseppe Conte, a formerly obscure law professor, to serve as prime minister. But the two populists, Di Maio and Salvini, were expected to back down on their earlier insistence that the 81-year-old Eurosceptic Paolo Savona, who had called Italy\u2019s adoption of the euro a \u201chistoric mistake\u201d, serve as finance minister. There were also small indications that the populists would try to assure markets that they were not planning any big moves to try to hasten an Italian exit out of the euro, a fear that roiled markets this week. The full story is here: Given the controversy over the comments from male executives making excuses for why there are now women on their boards, the fact that the new member of the Bank of England\u2019s MPC is male hardly helps matters. Worse - the shortlist for the appointment included four women and one man. And the man was given the job. From the Treasury release: The release also says: The Treasury is committed to appointing a diverse range of people to public appointments, including at the Bank of England. The Treasury continues to work to attract the broadest range of suitable applicants for posts. As part of this recruitment process, the Chief Economic Advisor at the Treasury and chair of the interview panel contacted 87 potential applicants to inform them of the vacancy, of whom 44 were women. Could Haskel also be hawkish? David Owen, chief european financial economist at Jefferies, says: His expertise will also be invaluable when it comes to assessing how much spare capacity there is in the UK economy, as well as trend GDP growth, both key when looking at monetary policy. Jonathan Haskel\u2019s recent book \u201cCapitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy\u201d highlights the growing use of things that we cannot really measure accurately in the production process in the UK. Everything being equal, this would suggest that labour productivity is stronger than official estimates suggest and like Ian McCafferty (who leaves the BoE in August) will vote for a rate rise when he joins the MPC. The government has appointed Jonathan Haskel, a professor of economics at Imperial College Business School, as the newest member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate setting Monetary Policy Committee. Haskel will serve a three year term as an external member and will start on 1 September, when Ian McCafferty\u2019s term ends. In his Imperial College profile, Haskel says: My main research interests are productivity, innovation, intangible investment and growth. I currently study (a) how much firms investment in \u201cintangible\u201d or \u201cknowledge\u201d assets, such as software, R&amp;D and new business processes (b) how much such investment contributes to economic growth as whole and (c) what public policy implications there might be, especially for science policy. This work uses a mix of data at the levels of company, individual, industry and whole economy. Economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank said the eurozone inflation figure puts the European Central Bank in an awkward position: As this jump in inflation just thinly masks underlying core weakness and uncertainty about the economy is high, it is unlikely to convince the ECB to normalise policy more quickly.... [The] core inflation reading is still below where we would expect it to be with the improving labour market and increased selling prices indicated in business surveys. And, as selling price expectations have been weakening in the recent soft patch of economic data, it does not seem like we are at the start of a marked increase in inflation. The understatement of recent months was also helped by a weakening euro, which dampened some of the effects from the higher oil price. Petrol prices jumped significantly in May, on the back of an oil price of around $80 per barrel for most of the month and a weakening euro. Be careful what you wish for, ECB. After years of pushing for inflation to return to just under 2%, it could not have come at a more difficult time. Eurozone financial market turmoil has returned because of Italian politics this week and it is very difficult to see how the Italian political situation is going to play out. Economic data has been weakening over the past months, and the ECB is eager to determine whether this is just a soft patch. Finally, the US seems on the brink of announcing tariffs on European steel and aluminium, which clouds the exports outlook and could have an additional inflationary impact if the trade conflict gets out of hand. The ECB therefore now has to decide whether it will provide certainty straight away by announcing an extension to QE or take a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach at the June meeting. Then it could just hint at an extension while taking another six weeks to see how the political situation in Italy and the trade conflict with the US play out, and take in more economic data. Eurozone inflation rose by more than expected in May, partly due to the recent surge in oil prices. The increase towards the European Central Bank\u2019s target comes as it wants to run down its stimulus programme, but faces the prospect of market turbulence disturbing its plans. The cost of living in the 19 eurozone countries rose from 1.2% in April to 1.9% in May, according to an initial estimate from Eurostat, higher than the forecasts of around 1.6%. Energy prices rose by 6.1% compared to 2.6% in April, while food was 2.6% higher, uup from 2.4%. Excluding energy and food prices, inflation rose from 1.1% to 1.3%. Meanwhile unemployment in the eurozone fell from 8.6% in March to 8.5% in April. A UK interest rate rise in August is by no means a done deal, says ING Bank economist James Smith. Commenting on the credit figures, he says: It\u2019s not something markets or analysts typically spend much time looking at each month, but the unexpectedly sharp fall in consumer credit in March was probably a key factor in the Bank of England\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold in May. Admittedly the reasons for this sudden decline were fairly unclear, and the latest figures released today show that the amount of unsecured consumer credit supplied fully recovered in April, rising by \u00a31.8 billion. This tentatively suggests that the fall was simply a blip, perhaps related to the wider economic slowdown in March (although it\u2019s not entirely clear why the bad weather would have resulted in such a sharp change). We still think this is a story worth keeping an eye on over the next couple of months. A net 39% of banks said they tightened up on credit availability in the first quarter according to a Bank of England survey. If credit growth were to slow further, it would no doubt be a bad omen for growth - particularly as, of what little spending there has been over the past year, much of it appears to have been financed by borrowing. Meanwhile consumers continue to remain cautious. While household incomes are no longer being squeezed quite as much as before, shoppers are now being confronted with higher petrol prices, and the latest confidence surveys suggest individuals remain pessimistic about the economic situation overall. These cracks forming in the retail sector remain a big risk to the Bank of England outlook. While we are inclined to think policymakers have a preference to hike rates again in August if economic data allows (particularly given the better wage growth trend), this is certainly not a done deal. As one committee member said recently, the cost of waiting a bit longer before hiking rates is relatively low. The independent economist is referring to remarks made earlier this month at at select committee hearing, when Sir Dave said there was a risk households were spending less than the Bank had expected - as reported by the Financial Times (\u00a3). Speaking of credit, there has been a spike in borrowing by UK consumers in April after a slowdown the previous month blamed on the snowy weather. Consumer credit lending rose by a higher than expected \u00a31.832bn, the biggest increase since November 2016, compared to an increase of just \u00a3425m in March. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of \u00a31.3bn. The number of mortgages approved slipped from 62,802 in March to 62,455, less than the expected 63,000. Net mortgage lending rose by \u00a33.894bn. Here\u2019s our story on the Financial Conduct Authority clamping down on high cost credit: The City watchdog is planning a price cap for rent-to-own retailers as part of a crackdown on high-cost credit and overdrafts to save consumers more than \u00a3200m a year. Although stopping short of capping charges on overdrafts, the Financial Conduct Authority outlined a series of measures on Thursday amid growing calls to protect vulnerable consumers. The changes, the result of an 18-month review by the regulator, come as the Bank of England becomes increasingly concerned about rapid growth in personal borrowing, which is returning to levels unseen since the financial crisis. The Hollywood actor Michael Sheen, debt charities and the Labour party have applied significant pressure on the regulator to act. The FCA said it would consider introducing a price cap for the rent-to-own sector, which includes firms such as BrightHouse, from as early as April next year, although it warned it would need to consult on the measure with the industry first. The full report is here: More positive news for Italy: Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped into the red but other European markets are holding up as investors await the latest developments in the Italian political crisis. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Further steps in the right direction in regards to Italy avoiding another snap election \u2013 even if it does result in the Five Star Movement and League parties forming a Eurosceptic government \u2013 allowed the European markets to hold steady on Thursday. Rising 0.4% the euro managed to put a bit more distance between it and the 10 month lows it struck against the dollar on Tuesday night, the single currency climbing back towards $1.17 after the bell. Against the pound it was a bit more sluggish; however, flat at just under \u20ac1.14, it is trading at the top end of its recent bracket. The Eurozone indices, meanwhile, were broadly positive as well. Though the DAX dipped into the red, the CAC and FTSE MIB both continued to rise, the latter especially expressing its relief that things \u2013 for now, at least \u2013 appear to be calming down. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what role the Eurozone\u2019s May inflation reading plays in the day\u2019s trading. The surge in oil prices means analysts are expecting a sharp month-on-month jump, from 1.2% to 1.6%; that could give the euro a bit more room to breathe, but only if investors are willing to overlook the fact that the increase isn\u2019t really due to anything going on in the Eurozone. Italian bond yields - which soared on Tuesday as the price fell on political concerns - continue to fall back. The two year yield is now down at 0.9% as calm returns - for the moment at least. Two days ago the yield hit 2.84%. Australian shares ended the month on a positive note, helped by the hopes for a solution to the Italian crisis and a rise in mining shares on the back of higher commodity prices. The S&amp;P/AX index rose 0.5% on the day, helping it to a similar increase for the month as a whole. Markets are likely to remain volatile, says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com: European equities are firmer in early trade and yesterday\u2019s rebound for stocks may well hold if we see the two populists form a government, though longer term any such government faces a clash with the EU/ECB. They may also face a considerable backlash from bond markets again \u2013 calm for the moment \u2013 if they push ahead with plans to increase debt-to-GDP... Reports this morning suggest Paolo Savona could become foreign minister in a Lega-M5S government, a move that could be palatable for all the sides. In the near term the avoidance of snap elections would be positive for risk, but longer-term concerns remain. It does look as though the main risk being priced in earlier this week when bonds and stocks sold off sharply was the threat of another election that could have been framed in a more anit-EU light. Again we must reiterate that stock and bond markets will remain volatile and highly sensitive to the political situation in Rome. Added to this we have the prospect of a no-confidence vote in Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, a move that would likely bring down the centre-right government. The debate, which starts today, adds to investor concerns that Europe is in a very rocky patch politically at the moment. It is indeed a positive start for European markets, albeit a slightly tentative one given all the geopolitical tensions at the moment. With hopes of a resolution to the Italian political impasse, the country\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 0.38%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.12% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.18%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is up 0.19%. Economist Paul Donovan at UBS said: We are not back to normal, but markets have reacquainted themselves with what normal might look like. Italian bond yields fell and the euro recovered yesterday. A consensus is forming that there will not be elections in Italy until September at the earliest. Italian President Mattarella is waiting to see if the two anti-parties can in fact form a coalition. Ahead of the eurozone inflation figure we have had an update from France. Reuters reports: French inflation rose in May to its highest level since August 2012, according to data from the INSEE national statistics agency, adding to a raft of strong inflation readings across the euro zone as the European Central Bank considers whether or not to tighten its monetary policy. French consumer prices rose from April due partly to higher energy and food prices. The year-on-year inflation rate came in at 2.3 percent, according to EU-harmonised data from INSEE, above a forecast for an inflation reading of 2.0 percent according to a Reuters poll. Earlier this week, data had also shown inflation in Germany, the euro zone\u2019s biggest economy, surging more than expected in May to its highest level in more than a year, while data also showed inflation picking up in Spain. Germany\u2019s May inflation of 2.2 percent also surpassed the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) target of just under 2 percent for the euro zone as a whole. ING Bank economist James Smith says the UK credit numbers could be interesting: Here\u2019s more on the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s clampdown on high cost credit. FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said: High-cost credit is used by over three million consumers in the UK, some of who are the most vulnerable in society. Today we have proposed a significant package of reforms to ensure they are better protected including the possibility of a cap on rent-to-own lending. The proposals will benefit overdraft and high-cost credit users, rebalancing in the favour of the customer. Here is the full FCA announcement. Eurozone inflation is expected to move sharply higher, partly due to the recent surge in oil prices. UniCredit economists said: We expect headline inflation to rebound strongly in May, from 1.2% to 1.8% year on year. We see two main drivers: a rebound in core inflation and a jump in energy prices. Core inflation probably reversed its April drop and rose to 1.1% year on year from 0.7%. This would reflect normalization in the price of holiday-sensitive items, with the April reading having been distorted to the downside by the early timing of Easter. Surging oil prices are likely to push energy prices up strongly, adding 0.3 percentage points to headline inflation . Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Optimism that the Italian political crisis can be resolved without new elections is expected to see markets continue their revival today. The 5 Star and Lega parties are making renewed efforts to form a coalition, which has eased fears that a new vote could give a mandate for the country to leave the euro - Italexit or Quitaly, take your pick. So Italian bond yields have fallen back from their highs earlier in the week, while European markets are expected to make a positive start. CMC Markets UK\u2019s opening forecasts show The FTSE 100 up 3 points Germany\u2019s Dax 20 points higher France\u2019s Cac climbing 8 points Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB up 50 points. CMC\u2019s chief market analyst Michael Hewson said: [Market] optimism was reinforced by a call from the Five Star movement for Paolo Savona to withdraw his candidacy for the position of finance minister. This would appear to be at odds with the position of the League and its leader Matteo Salvini, whose pick Savona is. The differences of opinion between the two parties certainly don\u2019t bode well for any future relationship in government, if Salvini does change his mind about Savona and put someone else forward as finance minister... Even though investors have significant concerns about the recent steep rise in Italian borrowing costs it should be noted they still remain well below their long-term averages prior to the financial crisis, when they were on average in and around the 4% level for most of the noughties. This means that while Italian borrowing costs now are high relative to the last few years, they still remain low by historical standards. Still, investors would be right to be cautious. Italy is not the only potential problem in the eurozone, with Spain\u2019s prime minister Rajoy facing a no confidence vote on Friday. On the same day, the EU\u2019s temporary exemption from the US steel and aluminium tariffs is due to expire although developments could come as soon as today, while there are also the continuing concerns about a trade war between the US and China, as well the situation in North Korea. It\u2019s set to be a busier day all round, with news already that the UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority is clamping down on high cost credit. Meanwhile Nationwide\u2019s latest house price index has shown weaker than expected growth in May, with prices up 2.4%, down from a 2.6% increase in April and below the expected figure of 3%. Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of property lender, Octane Capital, said: Tight supply and subdued demand are the key contributors to the ongoing limbo gripping the UK property market. A lethargic economy populated by cautious and squeezed consumers has created a property market lacking both momentum and direction. And on the corporate front, the chief executive of train and bus business FirstGroup is leaving with immediate effect. As the company reported a poor set of results, Tim O\u2019Toole said: The time is right for me to step aside. Today\u2019s results clear the way for the new approach sought by our Chairman and the Board. Investors will also be watching out for European inflation figures after Wednesday\u2019s higher than expected consumer price index from Germany.

Overcapacity remains at the heart of the problem and the EU is not the source of but on the contrary equally hurt by it.</em> <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b100c72e4b022a3efa0e0a2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T15:02:49.823Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Markets are down</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US equities fell on the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 250 points.

There is an eerie sense of calm after all the ructions caused by the Italian political crisis, with investors hoping a new government can be formed after all without the need for another election campaign. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Not too long ago, a coalition government in Italy consisting of two eurosceptic populist parties was a feared and unlikely prospect that many believed would majorly concern investors. While much of this remains true, it is also currently viewed as the least unattractive and feasible outcome for markets, with the other alternative being fresh elections and the possibility that the parties are given an even stronger and potentially less euro-friendly mandate. </p> <p>Italy\u2019s President, Sergio Mattarella, may have believed he was acting in the best interest of the country when he rejected to populists choice of Finance Minister but the reality is that in doing so, he has given both parties more ammunition with which to attack the euro. Mattarella has already been accused of acting on behalf of Germany and others while Brussels has been accused of interference, it all feeds very well into the eurosceptics message that the country no longer even has control over its domestic politics.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b35d86c9efd92c20581531724ce127c1ec69232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b35d86c9efd92c20581531724ce127c1ec69232/0_22_5309_3184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Quirinale presidential palace in Rome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Quirinale presidential palace in Rome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Should the country move straight on to another election, both Five Star Movement and Lega will look to take advantage of any fury linked to perceived meddling and could significantly add to their numbers.

With both parties now in discussions again, there is a hope that the political impasse can be resolved which is helping to lift sentiment in the near-term. That said, a positive outcome now poses many further risks in the long-term. </p> <p>While Italian assets have bore the brunt of the pain from the latest period of political instability and uncertainty, there has been a negative impact on the wider markets including the euro which dropped to a 10-month low against the dollar.

And, as selling price expectations have been weakening in the recent soft patch of economic data, it does not seem like we are at the start of a marked increase in inflation.</p> <p>The understatement of recent months was also helped by a weakening euro, which dampened some of the effects from the higher oil price. Petrol prices jumped significantly in May, on the back of an oil price of around $80 per barrel for most of the month and a weakening euro.</p> <p>Be careful what you wish for, ECB. After years of pushing for inflation to return to just under 2%, it could not have come at a more difficult time. Eurozone financial market turmoil has returned because of Italian politics this week and it is very difficult to see how the Italian political situation is going to play out. Economic data has been weakening over the past months, and the ECB is eager to determine whether this is just a soft patch. Finally, the US seems on the brink of announcing tariffs on European steel and aluminium, which clouds the exports outlook and could have an additional inflationary impact if the trade conflict gets out of hand.</p> <p>The ECB therefore now has to decide whether it will provide certainty straight away by announcing an extension to QE or take a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach at the June meeting. Then it could just hint at an extension while taking another six weeks to see how the political situation in Italy and the trade conflict with the US play out, and take in more economic data.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T10:41:13.432Z\">at 11.41am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b0fba4ae4b022a3efa0dbd4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T09:22:43.101Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone inflation higher than forecast in May</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Eurozone inflation rose by more than expected in May, partly due to the recent surge in oil prices.</p> <p>The increase towards the European Central Bank\u2019s target comes as it wants to run down its stimulus programme, but faces the prospect of market turbulence disturbing its plans.</p> <p>The cost of living in the 19 eurozone countries rose from 1.2% in April to 1.9% in May, according to an initial estimate from Eurostat, higher than the forecasts of around 1.6%.</p> <p>Energy prices rose by 6.1% compared to 2.6% in April, while food was 2.6% higher, uup from 2.4%.</p> <p>Excluding energy and food prices, inflation rose from 1.1% to 1.3%.</p> <p>Meanwhile unemployment in the eurozone fell from 8.6% in March to 8.5% in April.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82b98669c1329634d7a1a36658ac347054cd128f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82b98669c1329634d7a1a36658ac347054cd128f/0_0_995_377/500.jpg\" alt=\"euinflate1\" width=\"500\" height=\"189\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9ba4c6e0ea587e4cdb33cf674d26a941612570c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9ba4c6e0ea587e4cdb33cf674d26a941612570c/0_0_1018_417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"euinflat2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"410\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T09:24:44.029Z\">at 10.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b0fb999e4b069235b5cf035\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T09:02:20.756Z\">10.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A UK interest rate rise in August is by no means a done deal, says ING Bank economist James Smith. Commenting on the credit figures, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s not something markets or analysts typically spend much time looking at each month, but the unexpectedly sharp fall in consumer credit in March was probably a key factor in the Bank of England\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold in May.</p> <p>Admittedly the reasons for this sudden decline were fairly unclear, and the latest figures released today show that the amount of unsecured consumer credit supplied fully recovered in April, rising by \u00a31.8 billion. This tentatively suggests that the fall was simply a blip, perhaps related to the wider economic slowdown in March (although it\u2019s not entirely clear why the bad weather would have resulted in such a sharp change).</p> <p>We still think this is a story worth keeping an eye on over the next couple of months. A net 39% of banks said they tightened up on credit availability in the first quarter according to a Bank of England survey. If credit growth were to slow further, it would no doubt be a bad omen for growth - particularly as, of what little spending there has been over the past year, much of it appears to have been financed by borrowing.</p> <p>Meanwhile consumers continue to remain cautious. While household incomes are no longer being squeezed quite as much as before, shoppers are now being confronted with higher petrol prices, and the latest confidence surveys suggest individuals remain pessimistic about the economic situation overall.</p> <p>These cracks forming in the retail sector remain a big risk to the Bank of England outlook. While we are inclined to think policymakers have a preference to hike rates again in August if economic data allows (particularly given the better wage growth trend), this is certainly not a done deal.</p> <p>As one committee member said recently, the cost of waiting a bit longer before hiking rates is relatively low.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0fb766e4b069235b5cf020\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T08:59:30.553Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/status/1002106329656328198\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Is Sir Dave Ramsden of the Bank of England around to explain how an extra \u00a31.8 billion of unsecured lending in April is &quot;weak credit growth&quot; please?</p>&mdash; Shaun Richards (@notayesmansecon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/status/1002106329656328198?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The independent economist is referring to remarks made earlier this month at at select committee hearing, when Sir Dave said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8b0348e-5da1-11e8-ad91-e01af256df68\">there was a risk households were spending less than the Bank had expected - as reported by the Financial Times (\u00a3).</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0fb2d2e4b00330690614d3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T08:44:58.118Z\">9.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK consumer credit surges in April</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking of credit, there has been a spike in borrowing by UK consumers in April after a slowdown the previous month blamed on the snowy weather.</p> <p>Consumer credit lending rose by a higher than expected \u00a31.832bn, the biggest increase since November 2016, compared to an increase of just \u00a3425m in March.

The 5 Star and Lega parties are making renewed efforts to form a coalition, which has eased fears that a new vote could give a mandate for the country to leave the euro - Italexit or Quitaly, take your pick.</p> <p>So Italian bond yields have fallen back from their highs earlier in the week, while European markets are expected to make a positive start. CMC Markets UK\u2019s opening forecasts show</p> <ul> <li>The FTSE 100 up 3 points</li> <li>Germany\u2019s Dax 20 points higher</li> <li>France\u2019s Cac climbing 8 points</li> <li>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB up 50 points.</li> </ul> <p>CMC\u2019s chief market analyst Michael Hewson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Market] optimism was reinforced by a call from the Five Star movement for Paolo Savona to withdraw his candidacy for the position of finance minister. This would appear to be at odds with the position of the League and its leader Matteo Salvini, whose pick Savona is. The differences of opinion between the two parties certainly don\u2019t bode well for any future relationship in government, if Salvini does change his mind about Savona and put someone else forward as finance minister...<strong> </strong></p> <p>Even though investors have significant concerns about the recent steep rise in Italian borrowing costs it should be noted they still remain well below their long-term averages prior to the financial crisis, when they were on average in and around the 4% level for most of the noughties. This means that while Italian borrowing costs now are high relative to the last few years, they still remain low by historical standards.</p> </blockquote> <p>Still, investors would be right to be cautious.

      "bodyText": "Pre-paid funeral plans could be hit with tougher regulation under government plans to deal with bad practice in the sector. The Guardian understands that the government is due to launch a consultation on regulating the funeral sector, where around 1.3 million people in the UK have a pre-paid plan. But the schemes are not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and several providers are not even registered with the industry\u2019s voluntary regulator, the Funeral Planning Authority (FPA), which has limited powers of a maximum \u00a35,000 or expulsion from the regulator. Some companies have been accused by campaigners of misleading advertising and aggressive cold-calling and telesales, and offering little customer protection for their investment if the firm folds. A report last year by consumer group Fairer Finance said some operators were running a \u201cquasi-Ponzi scheme\u201d, where they allegedly use money from new customers to pay current claimants. The government consultation, due to be announced by the Treasury, will consider evidence on whether to bring the plans under the FCA\u2019s remit or beef up the industry regulator\u2019s powers, although there is thought to be limited appetite for creating a new statutory body. Dignity, one of the biggest funeral providers, which sponsored the report last year, said it had long lobbied for stricter regulation of the sector. The firm\u2019s research found 75% of people with funeral plans mistakenly believed their plan to be regulated by the FCA. The firm\u2019s head of insight, Simon Cox, said persistent and pushy cold-calling was rife from some companies, with no oversight. \u201cThere are a growing number of new providers taking advantage of a regulation gap and are not regulated at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a number of options open to the government and we will be recommending that the FPA is put on a statutory footing to compel all organisations selling funeral plans to be regulated. \u201cHowever, what is most important is that the regulation gap in the sector is filled. If this option is not possible, then a body with statutory powers such as the FCA is infinitely better than the status quo.\u201d Pre-payment plans cost between \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000, typically paid for via monthly instalments. Campaigners have raised concerns that many people may not be aware of hefty administration fees, which can be as high as \u00a31,000, charged by some providers acting as middlemen between the customer and the funeral director. Though a pre-paid plan is similar to an insurance product, the law exempts the providers from regulation by the FCA if they put customers\u2019 money either into a trust or a \u201cwhole of life\u201d insurance policy. The vast majority of providers make use of that exemption. If customers are mis-sold a plan by an unregulated provider, they are unable to complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service and have no protection if a provider goes out of business. The SNP MP Neil Gray, who has campaigned in parliament for a crackdown on firms, said he was \u201cabsolutely delighted\u201d that a consultation was in the works and that he believed ministers were taking the issue seriously. \u201cFuneral plans are a good thing. They are an anti-poverty measure and an effective way of planning for the future, but if a provider goes bust or there are hidden fees, there is currently very little that individuals can do.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The United States and its traditional allies are on the brink of a full-scale trade war after European and Canadian leaders reacted swiftly and angrily to Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium producers. The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, promised immediate retaliation after the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said EU companies would face a 25% duty on steel and a 10% duty on aluminium from midnight on Thursday. Europe, along with Canada and Mexico, had been granted a temporary reprieve from the tariffs after they were unveiled by Donald Trump two months ago. However, Ross sent shudders through global financial markets when he said insufficient progress had been made in talks with three of the US\u2019s traditional allies to reduce America\u2019s trade deficit and that the waiver was being lifted. Wall Street slumped as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down more than 250 points as investors sold off shares in manufacturers and corporations with global reach. Shares across Europe also declined. The move from Washington \u2013 which comes at a time when Trump is also threatening protectionist action against China \u2013 triggered an immediate and angry response from Canada, Brussels and from individual European capitals. Juncker called the US move \u201cunjustified\u201d and said the EU had no choice but to hit back with tariffs on US goods and a case at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva. \u201cWe will defend the Union\u2019s interests, in full compliance with international trade law,\u201d he added. Brussels has already announced that it would target Levi\u2019s jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and bourbon whiskey. The UK, which has hopes of agreeing a trade liberalisation deal with the US after Brexit, expressed alarm at Ross\u2019s announcement. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, said Britain would not rule out countermeasures or taking Washington to the WTO, which arbitrates on global trade disputes. Speaking to Sky News he attacked the tariffs as \u201cpatently absurd\u201d and urged the US to think again. \u201cIt would be a great pity if we ended up in a tit-for-tat trade dispute with our closest allies.\u201d A spokesman for Number 10 said the government was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d the US had decided to apply the tariffs and that Theresa May would raise the issue with Trump at next week\u2019s meeting of the G7 industrial nations in Canada. \u201cThe UK and other European Union countries are close allies of the US and should be permanently and fully exempted from the American measures on steel and aluminium.\u201d The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called the US tariffs illegal and a mistake, while the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, issued an immediate like-for-like response \u2013 announcing tariffs of up to 25% on US imports worth up to 16.6bn Canadian dollars (\u00a39.6bn), which was the total value of Canadian steel exports to the US last year. The tariffs will cover steel and aluminium as well as orange juice, whiskey and other food products. With the White House having used national security legislation to introduce the tariffs, Trudeau called the measures an \u201caffront\u201d to Canadians who had fought alongside their American comrades in arms. \u201cThat Canada could be considered a national security threat to the US is inconceivable.\u201d Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, went further calling her country\u2019s $16.6bn retaliatory tariffs \u201cthe strongest trade action Canada has taken in the postwar era. This is a very strong response. It is a proportionate response, it is perfectly reciprocal ... this is a very strong Canadian action in response to a very bad US decision.\u201d Mexico also denounced the move, saying it \u201cdeeply regrets and disapproves\u201d the US decision. The economics minstry said it would adopt equivalent measures on a variety of products, including flat steel, lamps, pork legs and shoulders, sausages and food preparations, apples, grapes, cranberries, various cheeses, and other products, \u201cup to an amount comparable to damage caused by the United States\u2019 action\u201d. It added: \u201cThis measure will be in force for as long as the US government maintains the imposed tariffs.\u201d Hopes remain that the fallout could be contained. Analysts at the research firm Oxford Economics said the economic hit for Europe would be well below 0.1% of GDP, as steel and aluminium only make up a small part of the bloc\u2019s overall exports around the world. However, they warned a tit-for-tat escalation leading to tariffs on other goods, such as cars, would have dire consequences for global trade. Last week, the Trump administration launched a national security probe into car imports on national security grounds that could lead to tariffs on cars from Europe, Japan and South Korea, should trade tensions spiral further out of control. For the struggling UK steel industry, the news of US tariffs prompted fresh alarm. The director of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said: \u201cPresident Trump had already loaded the gun and today, we now know that the US administration has unfortunately fired it and potentially started a damaging trade war. \u201cSince President Trump stated his plans to impose blanket tariffs on steel imports almost three months ago, the UK steel sector had hoped for the best but still feared the worst. With the expiration of the EU exemption now confirmed to take effect tomorrow [Friday, 1 June], unfortunately our pessimism was justified and we will now see damage not only to the UK steel sector but also the US economy.\u201d Representatives for the US metal industry also expressed disappointment. \u201cMake no mistake: restricting the raw material supply in the U.S. and imposing tariffs on imports from our closest trading partners places American manufacturers directly in harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Paul Nathanson of The Coalition of American Metal Manufacturers and Users. The CBI warned the EU against overreacting to Washington\u2019s move. Ben Digby, international director at the employers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cThe president\u2019s measures are deeply concerning for firms in the UK, for close trading partners and across supply chains.\u201d Trump announced his tariffs in March as a way of protecting US firms from cheap imports but Digby said the problem was caused by global overproduction of the metals and needed to be tackled jointly by Brussels and Washington. \u201cThere are no winners in a trade war, which will damage prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. These tariffs could lead to a protectionist domino effect, damaging firms, employees and consumers in the US, UK and many other trading partners. Now is not the time for any disproportionate escalation, and we urge the EU to consider this when initiating its response.\u201d But neither side showed any immediate sign of being willing to defuse the tension. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European trade commissioner, said the Brussels response would be proportionate and in accordance with WTO rules. Ross shrugged off the threat of EU retaliation, saying it would have little impact on the US economy. Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People\u2019s party, the largest group in the European parliament and a key ally of German chancellor Angela Merkel, warned that treating the EU as the \u201cenemy\u201d would damage US consumers. \u201cEurope does not want a trade conflict. We believe in a fair trade regime from which everybody benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have tried everything to make dialogue and mutual understanding prevail. If President Trump decides to treat Europe as an enemy, we will have no choice but to defend European industry, European jobs, European interests.\u201d Ross blamed insufficient progress in talks with Mexico and Canada over changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) for the US\u2019s decision to slap tariffs on its two neighbours. Mexico\u2019s under-secretary of foreign trade, Juan Carlos Baker, tweeted: \u201cMexico categorically rejects any unilateral, protectionist measures that distort trade in North America.\u201d China, too, warned that it would respond with tit-for-tat action of its own.",

What you need to know about US steel tariffs</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cWe will defend the Union\u2019s interests, in full compliance with international trade law,\u201d he added. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/02/china-expresses-grave-concerns-us-steel-tariff-plans\">Brussels has already announced</a> that it would target Levi\u2019s jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and bourbon whiskey.</p> <p>The UK, which has hopes of agreeing a trade liberalisation deal with the US after Brexit, expressed alarm at Ross\u2019s announcement. </p> <p>Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, said Britain would not rule out countermeasures or taking Washington to the WTO, which arbitrates on global trade disputes. </p> <p>Speaking to Sky News he attacked the tariffs as \u201cpatently absurd\u201d and urged the US to think again. \u201cIt would be a great pity if we ended up in a tit-for-tat trade dispute with our closest allies.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Number 10 said the government was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d the US had decided to apply the tariffs and that Theresa May would raise the issue with Trump at next week\u2019s meeting of the G7 industrial nations in Canada.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK and other European Union countries are close allies of the US and should be permanently and fully exempted from the American measures on steel and aluminium.\u201d</p> <p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called the US tariffs illegal and a mistake, while the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, issued an immediate like-for-like response \u2013 announcing tariffs of up to 25% on US imports worth up to 16.6bn Canadian dollars (\u00a39.6bn), which was the total value of Canadian steel exports to the US last year. The tariffs will cover steel and aluminium as well as orange juice, whiskey and other food products. </p> <p>With the White House having used national security legislation to introduce the tariffs, Trudeau called the measures an \u201caffront\u201d to Canadians who had fought alongside their American comrades in arms. \u201cThat Canada could be considered a national security threat to the US is inconceivable.\u201d</p> <p>Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, went further calling her country\u2019s $16.6bn retaliatory tariffs \u201cthe strongest trade action Canada has taken in the postwar era. This is a very strong response. It is a proportionate response, it is perfectly reciprocal ... this is a very strong Canadian action in response to a very bad US decision.\u201d </p> <p>Mexico also denounced the move, saying it \u201cdeeply regrets and disapproves\u201d the US decision. </p> <p>The economics minstry said it would adopt equivalent measures on a variety of products, including flat steel, lamps, pork legs and shoulders, sausages and food preparations, apples, grapes, cranberries, various cheeses, and other products, \u201cup to an amount comparable to damage caused by the United States\u2019 action\u201d.</p> <p>It added: \u201cThis measure will be in force for as long as the US government maintains the imposed tariffs.\u201d </p> <p>Hopes remain that the fallout could be contained. Analysts at the research firm Oxford Economics said the economic hit for Europe would be well below 0.1% of GDP, as steel and aluminium only make up a small part of the bloc\u2019s overall exports around the world. However, they warned a tit-for-tat escalation leading to tariffs on other goods, such as cars, would have dire consequences for global trade. </p> <p>Last week, the Trump administration launched a national security probe into car imports on national security grounds that could lead to tariffs on cars from Europe, Japan and South Korea, should trade tensions spiral further out of control.</p> <p>For the struggling UK steel industry, the news of US tariffs prompted fresh alarm. The director of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said: \u201cPresident Trump had already loaded the gun and today, we now know that the US administration has unfortunately fired it and potentially started a damaging trade war.</p> <p> \u201cSince President Trump stated his plans to impose blanket tariffs on steel imports almost three months ago, the UK steel sector had hoped for the best but still feared the worst. With the expiration of the EU exemption now confirmed to take effect tomorrow [Friday, 1 June], unfortunately our pessimism was justified and we will now see damage not only to the UK steel sector but also the US economy.\u201d</p> <p>Representatives for the US metal industry also expressed disappointment. \u201cMake no mistake: restricting the raw material supply in the U.S. and imposing tariffs on imports from our closest trading partners places American manufacturers directly in harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Paul Nathanson of The Coalition of American Metal Manufacturers and Users. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/02/china-expresses-grave-concerns-us-steel-tariff-plans\">Trump trade tariffs: Europe threatens US bikes, bourbon and bluejeans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The CBI warned the EU against overreacting to Washington\u2019s move. Ben Digby, international director at the employers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cThe president\u2019s measures are deeply concerning for firms in the UK, for close trading partners and across supply chains.\u201d</p> <p>Trump announced his tariffs in March as a way of protecting US firms from cheap imports but Digby said the problem was caused by global overproduction of the metals and needed to be tackled jointly by Brussels and Washington.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no winners in a trade war, which will damage prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. These tariffs could lead to a protectionist domino effect, damaging firms, employees and consumers in the US, UK and many other trading partners. Now is not the time for any disproportionate escalation, and we urge the EU to consider this when initiating its response.\u201d</p> <p>But neither side showed any immediate sign of being willing to defuse the tension. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European trade commissioner, said the Brussels response would be proportionate and in accordance with WTO rules. Ross shrugged off the threat of EU retaliation, saying it would have little impact on the US economy.</p> <p> Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People\u2019s party, the largest group in the European parliament and a key ally of German chancellor Angela Merkel, warned that treating the EU as the \u201cenemy\u201d would damage US consumers. <br></p> <p>\u201cEurope does not want a trade conflict.

Let\u2019s remind ourselves of the ambition as it applies to gender diversity: a tripling of the proportion of women in senior roles to 35% by 2020. Thursday was not a good day. From a shortlist comprising four women and one man, the man got the gig to be the next member of the high-profile monetary policy committee To be fair to the Bank, it played no role: the chancellor, Philip Hammond, made the appointment. It is possible that Mark Carney, who often points out that he is the 120th in an unbroken line of male governors, is privately tearing his hair out. To be fair also to Jonathan Haskel, professor of economics at Imperial College Business School, he was a perfectly decent candidate; his expertise in productivity could be useful in the current climate. Yet this feels like a huge missed opportunity by the Treasury, whatever it says about how it contacted 44 women to apply for the post. The next opportunity to address the 8-1 male bias on the monetary committee may not arise for another four years, given the tenures of the current crew. It is only Carney who is definitely departing soon and the betting odds heavily suggest the 121st governor will also be male. Meanwhile, the 13-strong financial policy committee contains one woman. And 10 of the 12 members of the Bank\u2019s governing court are men. The Labour MP Rachel Reeves, chair of the business select committee, called the latest appointment \u201ctruly staggering\u201d. In a week in which some of the business world\u2019s ludicrous justifications for male-dominated boardrooms were exposed in a government-commissioned report, one can only agree. Haskel, no doubt, will pass his confirmation hearing in front of the Treasury select committee with flying colours. It would more interesting to hear the MPs grill Hammond. O\u2019Toole\u2019s exit from FirstGroup was inevitable The miracle is that Tim O\u2019Toole lasted eight years as the chief executive of FirstGroup. An innings of that length usually counts as decent when the share price travels in the right direction. At FirstGroup under O\u2019Toole, the journey has been from 300p to 90p. Shareholders haven\u2019t even had the consolidation of a dividend for the past half-decade. The source of half of FirstGroup\u2019s woes is the top-of-the-market $3.6bn cash takeover in 2007 of US group Laidlaw, owner of an impressive school bus operation but also the Greyhound long-distance coach business. That deal happened before O\u2019Toole\u2019s arrival but his attempts to deal with the debt hangover never hit the mark. The thumping \u00a3615m rights issue in 2013 only semi-repaired the balance sheet and the option of selling Greyhound was resisted, with the word \u201ciconic\u201d being grossly overused. It is only now, with FirstGroup taking a \u00a3277m goodwill impairment against Greyhound, that a sale is being contemplated amid grumbles about competition from icon-toppling US budget airlines. The other write-down definitely relates to events on O\u2019Toole\u2019s watch. A sum of \u00a3106m is being charged as an \u201conerous contract provision\u201d on the TransPennine Express rail franchise to cover expected losses out to 2023. This looks to be a straightforward case of overbidding in 2015 to retain the franchise. There was nothing wrong with passenger revenues at TransPennine last year \u2013 they were up 10%. In the circumstances, O\u2019Toole\u2019s resignation was inevitable after the latest grim results. The shame is that for the first 20 years of its life FirstGroup was a story of stunning success as it grew from a few bus routes in Dundee to become the UK\u2019s biggest transport company. Recent chapters have involved scraps with activist investors and, last month, a vague bid approach from the private equity group Apollo Management, which was dismissed by the board as \u201copportunistic\u201d. Despite FirstGroup\u2019s many woes, saying no to Apollo was justified. There should \u2013 still \u2013 be a decent business lurking within. It does, though, require the next boss to change a corporate mindset that the Unite union fairly condemned as \u201cmanaged decline\u201d under O\u2019Toole. Find some rigour \u2013 quickly. Pensions Regulator chief lacks fear factor Lesley Titcomb, the chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, can take a hint. She won\u2019t seek to renew her four-year contract when it ends next February. Mind you, MPs were hardly subtle in pointing out the exit door. The \u201ccurrent leadership\u201d of the organisation may not be equipped for cultural change, said the two committees probing Carillion\u2019s collapse, adding that \u201ca tentative and apologetic approach is ingrained\u201d. The work and pensions committee called next year\u2019s corporate plan \u201cvery modest in scope\u201d. Many in the pensions industry think it\u2019s all terribly unfair. The worst mistakes at BHS and Carillion were made before Titcomb became boss. Wasn\u2019t the government giving mixed messages on how quickly companies should close pension deficits? Hasn\u2019t Titcomb also managed the logistical challenge of rolling out auto enrolment? Well, yes, some sympathy is in order. But regulation is a rough business and a pensions enforcer needs to be feared in the outside world. Titcomb, perhaps out of loyalty to long-serving staff, never was.",

      "bodyText": "Landlords of struggling Italian chain Carluccio\u2019s have backed a restructuring plan that could result in the closure of more than 30 of its restaurants. On Thursday, 91% of the restaurant chain\u2019s creditors voted in favour of a company voluntary agreement (CVA), an insolvency procedure that is currently being used by restauranteurs and retailers to shed loss-making sites. The Carluccio\u2019s chief executive, Mark Jones, said: \u201cWe are pleased that our proposal for a CVA has been approved by our creditors. This vote was vital to protect our strong core business and the Carluccio\u2019s brand.\u201d The restaurant chain founded by the late chef Antonio Carluccio in 1999 is the latest casualty of the casual dining crunch, which has forced major chains including rival Prezzo, the burger chain Byron and Jamie\u2019s Italian, which had also over-expanded, to close restaurants amid a slowdown in consumer spending. A group of 34 restaurants, which employ about 500 people, are affected by the CVA with landlords agreeing to cut rent bills by a third for six months. They will close at the end of that period unless a new, reduced rent deal is agreed. Will Wright, a restructuring partner at KPMG and joint supervisor of the CVA, said: \u201cThis is an important step forward for the business, allowing Carluccio\u2019s to complete its financial restructuring plan and embark on a comprehensive transformation programme.\u201d Carluccio\u2019s is controlled by the Landmark Group, the Dubai-based retail and hospitality conglomerate. It has promised to finance a multimillion-pound refurbishment programme for the 69 restaurants unaffected by the CVA. Jones, who joined from five-a-side football firm Goals Soccer Centres in January to lead a turnaround, added: \u201cThe positive outcome enables us to kickstart an extensive programme of reinvigoration across our estate \u2013 with the aim of elevating the guest experience and underpinned by our brand ethos of minimum of fuss, maximum of flavour, championed by Antonio Carluccio.\u201d A number of big high street names, including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare, have turned to CVAs to jettison unwanted stores. House of Fraser, the struggling department store, is the latest and is expected to publish an update on its restructuring plan imminently. But it is understood to be reviewing its options after it upset landlords by announcing a CVA, which would lead to the closure of at least 20 stores, without consulting them. If the department store chain does not win over its landlords, it is at risk of collapsing into administration as the restructuring plan is a condition for a multimillion-pound cash injection from C banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "How did the world come to the brink of a trade war? A key theme of Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign in 2016 was that American jobs were being lost as a result of unfair global trade. Most commentators thought it was bluster when Trump threatened to impose swingeing tariffs on Chinese goods and to pull the US out of trade deals. But the US president has kept his campaign pledges. First, he withdrew the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement signed by Barack Obama. Then he launched an investigation into China\u2019s alleged theft of American intellectual property rights. In March, he said the US would impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminium. Further action against China has also been announced. So how big a deal is this? Potentially massive. The world is currently closer to a full-scale trade war than at any time since the 1930s, when the American Smoot-Hawley tariff prompted a domino effect among other industrialised nations. Many protectionist measures have been introduced since the global financial crisis of a decade ago but, for the most part, they have been small scale. The current tension is far more serious: it involves the world\u2019s three biggest economies \u2013 the US, China and the EU \u2013 and it is too big to ignore. The assumption is that Trump is using tariffs to squeeze better trade terms out of China and the EU, and to put the pressure on Canada and Mexico to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). But nobody knows for sure, and the fear is that the US action will damage business confidence at a time when growth is slowing. There are hopes the fallout could be contained. According to the Dutch bank ING, exports of steel and aluminium to the US make up just 0.3% of worldwide goods exports from the EU and represent a tiny 0.05% of the bloc\u2019s GDP. But should the situation escalate, the consequences could be dire. Should the US and EU ramp up various tariffs, including on cars, the impact could knock 0.4% from US growth and 0.3% from the EU. The US has a trade in goods deficit with the EU of about $38bn, with about $78bn exported to Europe from the US, and $116bn going the other way. Should the tariffs be raised by 10% above proposed levels, the OECD has estimated it would reduce global trade by about 6%. What happens now? The EU has said it will retaliate by slapping tariffs on a range of high-profile American goods and will start a case against the US at the World Trade Organisation, which polices global trade. If Trump responds to Europe\u2019s countermeasures with fresh action of his own, the conflict could escalate quickly. What is the impact on consumers? Consumers are often the ultimate losers from trade wars. Decades of globalisation mean retailers sell goods from all over the world, so higher tariffs on imports could push up the cost of high street goods. Manufacturers would raise their prices to deal with the higher cost of raw materials. Protecting the US steel industry might help its workers in the short-term, but if the US is unable to make steel as cheaply as foreign rivals have been able to, then American manufacturers would also face higher costs. The motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson has warned tariffs will probably push up costs for all of its products, regardless of where it gets its steel from, and that retaliation from the EU would have a \u201csignificant impact on our sales, our dealers, their suppliers and our customers\u201d. Alongside motorcycles, the EU has said it could slap additional tariffs on orange juice, whisky and Levi\u2019s jeans, which would hit US exporters and push up the cost of imports for European shoppers. Should the tit-for-tat escalate further, Trump might choose to impose tariffs on the European car industry \u2013 which would hit Germany hardest. Cars worth about $32bn were exported to the US from the EU in 2017 \u2013 about five times as large as steel and aluminium exports combined.",

      "bodyText": "The City watchdog has ordered banks to do more to help the 19 million people who regularly use their overdrafts but has dismayed campaigners seeking a cap on the \u00a32.3bn fees made when customers go into the red. The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s 18-month review into high-cost credit stepped back from a cap on overdraft fees because of fears it could be challenged in court by the banks, triggering sharp criticism from charities and MPs pushing for tougher action. Customers will instead be given more alerts via mobile phones, warning of charges as well as requiring the introduction of online tools to make the cost of overdrafts clearer. Messages on cash machines that customers have \u201cavailable funds\u201d that include their overdraft will be banned. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, called the steps from the FCA \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d, while Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business select committee, said: \u201cWhile the FCA \u2018consult\u2019 on some meagre remedies and \u2018discuss\u2019 further action, banks are allowed to continue to rip people off. This is not good enough.\u201d The FCA said it would consider introducing a price cap on rent-to-own, where stores such as BrightHouse sell cookers and household appliances on weekly payments. It found that customers ended up paying more than \u00a31,500 for ovens that sell in other high street shops for less than \u00a3300. The price cap, estimated to benefit about 400,000 people, is likely to come into force next April after consultation with the industry. It follows a drive by debt charities and campaigners, including the actor Michael Sheen, who put intense pressure on the regulator to act. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA and the frontrunner to be the next governor of the Bank of England, told the BBC \u201cwe don\u2019t want to screw up\u201d on price caps following a supreme court challenge that went in favour of the banks in 2009. However, he left the door open to a possible price cap in future, saying it could form part of a wider retail banking review due later this year. \u201cOur immediate proposed changes will make overdraft costs more transparent and prevent people unintentionally dipping in to an overdraft in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we believe more fundamental change is needed in the way banks charge customers for overdrafts.\u201d The FCA\u2019s main recommendations were: Mobile alerts warning of potential overdraft charges. Stopping the inclusion of overdrafts in the term \u201cavailable funds\u201d. Requiring online tools to make the cost of overdrafts clearer. Introducing online tools to assess eligibility for overdrafts. Making it clear that overdrafts are credit or borrowing. The FCA said it would introduce rules preventing home-collected credit firms, such as Provident Financial, from offering new loans or renewing old ones during home visits without a specific request from customers. Catalogue and store credit firms will be forced to do more to help customers avoid persistent debt. In total, the FCA said the crackdown will save consumers about \u00a3200m a year but campaigners said it had not gone far enough. Gareth Shaw of Which? said some overdraft charges could be seven times more expensive than a payday loan and called on the government to intervene as the FCA \u201ccontinues to drag its heels\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong that the regulator continues to delay taking action, leaving consumers affected by this unfair practice trapped in debt.\u201d The Bank of England has become increasingly concerned about rapid growth in personal borrowing, which is returning to levels unseen since the financial crisis amid sluggish wage growth and rising levels of inflation since the EU referendum almost two years ago. The latest figures show Britons increasing their borrowing at the fastest rate since November 2016 during April, when about \u00a31.8bn worth of debt was racked up on credit cards, personal loans and car finance. On the stock market, shares in banks and doorstep credit providers were largely unmoved. Goodbody Stockbrokers said: \u201cThe high-cost credit market will face little turbulence as a result of new regulation, a bit of a relief for the major players in this space.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Male bosses who gave a list of reasons for not hiring women to the most senior boardroom roles are making \u201cpitiful excuses\u201d, may be damaging their own businesses and are out of touch with the real world, senior female business figures have said. The backlash came after a list of comments made by chairmen and chief executives of FTSE 350 companies was published. Their remarks were collected by the ongoing Hampton-Alexander review into increasing female boardroom representation. One male business leader claimed women did not \u201cfit comfortably\u201d into a boardroom environment, another said women \u201cdon\u2019t want the hassle\u201d and a third said that \u201call the good women have already been snapped up\u201d. Reasons given by a range of chief executives and chairs of top 350 companies for not appointing more women directors: \u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t think women fit comfortably into the board environment\u201d \u2022 \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many women with the right credentials and depth of experience to sit on the board \u2013 the issues covered are extremely complex\u201d \u2022 \u201cMost women don\u2019t want the hassle or pressure of sitting on a board\u201d \u2022 \u201cShareholders just aren\u2019t interested in the makeup of the board, so why should we be?\u201d \u2022 \u201cMy other board colleagues wouldn\u2019t want to appoint a woman on our board\u201d \u2022 \u201cAll the \u2018good\u2019 women have already been snapped up\u201d \u2022 \u201cWe have one woman already on the board, so we are done \u2013 it is someone else\u2019s turn\u201d \u2022 \u201cThere aren\u2019t any vacancies at the moment \u2013 if there were I would think about appointing a woman\u201d \u2022 \u201cWe need to build the pipeline from the bottom \u2013 there just aren\u2019t enough senior women in this sector\u201d \u2022 \u201cI can\u2019t just appoint a woman because I want to\u201d Senior women in business lined up to lambast the anonymous male bosses behind the 10 selected quotes published by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of business lobby group the CBI, said they were \u201c10 pitiful excuses that have no place in today\u2019s Britain. \u201cWe need more female leaders \u2013 and not just on boards. No arguments, no excuses.\u201d According to the latest figures from the Hampton-Alexander review, which date from November, FTSE 100 boardrooms are 27.7% female, up from 12.5% in 2011. However, the proportion declines dramatically for the most senior positions, with only 10% of the highest full-time \u201cexecutive\u201d roles held by women. Only six out of the top 100 chief executive positions are held by women. The 30% Club, which campaigns for a minimum of 30% women on FTSE 100 boards, warned the comments published by BEIS indicated there was still a long way to go. The group\u2019s global chair, Brenda Trenowden, said they were the result of a minority of men likely to be damaging their own companies. \u201cIf they\u2019re so out of touch with the real world, I wonder if they\u2019re really qualified to be doing those jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s backwards thinking, it\u2019s wrong and if they honestly believe what they say, they\u2019re not doing justice to the companies they\u2019re chairing because they\u2019re missing out on a huge talent pool and they\u2019re going to get left behind.\u201d She called on the directors who made the comments to stop hiding behind anonymity and \u201cstep forward and show themselves\u201d. Stevie Spring, a media industry grandee and the remuneration committee chair of the Co-operative Group, ridiculed one director\u2019s comment bemoaning a lack of qualified women. She said: \u201cAll the good women have been snapped up? \u201cWe\u2019ve got true equality when mediocre women get snapped up, like mediocre men do.\u201d Spring, who said the Co-op\u2019s group executive was majority female, added that too few women were coming up through the ranks into senior positions. \u201cWomen on boards is about having the right pipeline of executive women and getting more senior executives onto the board,\u201d she said. The gender equality campaign group the Fawcett Society said it was concerned by the views expressed in some corners of the business community. \u201cThe idea that some of the most powerful people in the business world have so little self-awareness, appetite for innovation or interest in challenging overt sexism leaves me deeply worried about the future for our economy,\u201d the policy head, Jemima Olchawski, said. \u201cAnd these are just the things they were prepared to say out loud.\u201d Kate Grussing, the managing director of the recruitment firm Sapphire Partners, contested the suggestion that there were not enough women in the talent pool. \u201cThe appalling excuses given by many companies for why they can\u2019t appoint more women to board or executive roles are truly disgraceful, lame and lazy,\u201d she said. \u201cCompanies and recruiters have to be more creative and persistent in looking for diverse talent but it exists in greater numbers than ever. \u201cPutting token women on their boards or photographs on their careers website won\u2019t make a difference to the executive pipeline.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Amazon has been accused of treating staff like robots as it emerged that ambulances had been called out 600 times to the online retailer\u2019s UK warehouses in the past three years. A Freedom of Information request to ambulance services from the GMB union revealed 115 call-outs to Amazon\u2019s site in Rugeley, near Birmingham, including three relating to pregnancy or maternity problems and three for major trauma. There were also two call-outs to the site for electric shocks and eight for people who had fallen unconscious. At least 1,800 people work year-round at the Rugeley warehouse and more than 2,000 more can work over the peak Christmas period. That compares to only eight calls in total to a nearby Tesco warehouse of a similar physical size and where about 1,300 people work, over the same period, according to another FOI request by the union. Amazon said it was \u201csimply not correct to suggest that we have unsafe working conditions based on this data or on unsubstantiated anecdotes. Requests for ambulance services at our fulfilment centres are predominantly associated with personal health events and are not work related. Nevertheless, ambulance visits at our UK fulfilment centres last year was 0.00001 per worked hour, which is dramatically low.\u201d A spokesman said that, according to the Health and Safety Executive\u2019s method of reporting injuries, Amazon had 43% fewer injuries on average than other companies conducting transportation and warehousing activities in the UK. The GMB added that four-fifths of the 200 union members working for the American firm who had responded to a survey said they suffered pain as a result of their workload, with one pregnant woman complaining she had been forced to stand for her entire 10-hour shift. One woman said to the union: \u201cI told them I could not walk so many miles and I could not pick from low locations. I had a meeting with a safety manager and was also told: \u2018It\u2019s not what you want, it is what we decide\u2019. \u201cMy manager told me that most women are working on picking until their maternity leave. I know this is true because I saw ladies with huge bumps picking.\u201d Another woman said: \u201cI am pregnant and they put me to stand 10 hours without a chair \u2026 They are telling me to work hard even they know I am pregnant. I am feeling depressed when I am at work.\u201d Mick Rix, a GMB national officer, said the union was seeking advice about potential legal action about the physical pressures put on staff by Amazon, many of whom use electronic devices to monitor the speed at which they work. Its findings will be presented at the union\u2019s 101st annual congress in Brighton next week. Workers have said that the constant pressure to hit performance targets makes it difficult for them to take time out to visit the toilet or get a drink. Rix said the union had also been told of a woman who suffered a miscarriage while working, which she believed was partly as a result of continuous pressure to hit targets. The incident was discussed in a private briefing with GMB-affiliated MPs in parliament earlier this month. \u201cCompanies like Amazon should be treating staff with respect, not treating them like robots,\u201d Rix said. \u201cHundreds of ambulance call-outs, pregnant women telling us they are forced to stand for 10 hours a day, pick, stow, stretch and bend, pull heavy carts and walk miles \u2013 even miscarriages and pregnancy issues at work. \u201cNone of these things happen in a safe, happy working environments.\u201d Amazon said: \u201cWe don\u2019t recognise these allegations as an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings.\u201d The company said that once it was aware a worker was pregnant it carried out a full risk assessment and would \u201cif necessary consult a doctor\u201d. \u201cIf the employee\u2019s health or that of the unborn child is at risk due to the work that they are employed to do by Amazon, we will vary the employee\u2019s conditions to alleviate all risk or find the employee a suitable alternative role. We will, as a last option, place the employee on full paid sick leave,\u201d Amazon said. The company added: \u201cWhile any serious incident is one too many, we learn and improve our programmes, working to prevent future incidents. We are proud of our safety record and thousands of Amazonians work hard every day innovating ways to make it even better.\u201d The company said it did not monitor toilet breaks and had water stations in place to give workers easy access to water throughout their shifts.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England interest rate setting committee, which has only one woman among its nine members, will continue to be male-dominated after the Treasury opted to appoint the only man from a shortlist of five candidates. In a move that immediately sparked protests from women\u2019s groups, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said Jonathan Haskel, an Imperial College economist, would join the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, on the monetary policy committee (MPC) for a three-year term starting in September, when he will succeed the outgoing Ian McCafferty. The Treasury said four women were on the shortlist but an internal panel made up of two women and one man chose Haskel as the best candidate. Clare Lombardelli, first female chief economic adviser to the Treasury, chaired the panel. She was joined by the former MPC member Kate Barker and Richard Hughes, the Treasury\u2019s director of fiscal policy. A Women\u2019s Equality party (WEP) spokeswoman said the appointment of Haskel sent the wrong message about the Treasury\u2019s commitment to improving diversity in important areas of public life. \u201cIt suggests that even if they had an all-female shortlist, they would probably still appoint a man,\u201d she said. \u201cMacro-economic policy affects men and women differently because of their different positions in the economy and outside of it. Austerity has disproportionately hurt women, and trade liberalisation and changes to interest rates can have negative consequences for women\u2019s employment. \u201cUnless and until the Treasury pays greater attention to these issues, we cannot hope to make progress on women\u2019s equality.\u201d Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP for Leeds West and chair of the business select committee, said it was \u201ctruly staggering that the Treasury has failed to appoint a woman to this role\u201d. \u201cThe fact that four women were shortlisted shows that there are plenty of capable and well-qualified women but yet again the top jobs seem to be reserved for men.\u201d The decision comes only weeks after Threadneedle Street\u2019s deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, was forced to apologise for likening the economy\u2019s lack of productivity to the menopause. Ministers have also come under fire after the publication of figures that showed women chair only four of the 47 public bodies overseen by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. A report by the department also showed that of the 36 public bodies that work in partnership with BEIS, only seven are led by female chief executives. FTSE 100 bosses were criticised by the business minister Andrew Griffiths after his department released a report that revealed their objections to promoting women to senior positions, leaving only a handful of women on the boards of large companies. Griffiths said the Hampton-Alexander review showed that women had a long way to go before they gained parity in Britain\u2019s boardrooms. WEP said that while the government protested its dismay with the lack of women in the boardroom, it appeared to be unable to promote women when it had the opportunity. It said: \u201cThe government has today decried the pitiful excuses for women\u2019s underrepresentation in the boardrooms of listed companies. The question is, what\u2019s their excuse?\u201d Reeves added: \u201cOn the day the Hampton-Alexander review has revealed that firms are dragging their feet on diversity and making excuses for their own failures, this appointment demonstrates the true extent of the challenge that still exists in changing the face of our corporate and financial sectors.\u201d A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cWe are committed to diversity and encouraging the broadest range of candidates. We actively contacted 44 women to apply for this role, 80% of those interviewed were women and the majority of those on the interview panel were women. The final appointment decision was based on merit.\u201d Haskel came to prominence last year following the publication of his book Capitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy, and for his success in the Indigo prize for economics, which he shared with the Manchester University economist Diane Coyle. Haskell\u2019s team put forward a plan to extend GDP to measure intangible and free goods, and also to measure the welfare of societies. His views chime with those of several MPC members who believe officials statistics fail to capture the workings of a sophisticated economy in the digital age. Hammond said: \u201cI am confident that [Haskel\u2019s] expertise in productivity and innovation will further sharpen the committee\u2019s understanding of the British economy. Carney said: \u201cHis broad academic experience and the depth of his knowledge on productivity and innovation will be hugely valuable to the committee as we seek to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary stability.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of the Pensions Regulator(TPR), who has come in for criticism over her handling of successive crises at BHS and Carillion, has stepped down. Lesley Titcomb said she had taken the \u201cdifficult personal decision\u201d to leave the regulator at the end of her four-year contract in February 2019. Her departure comes only weeks after a report by two parliamentary committees investigating the collapse of the government contractor Carillion lambasted the regulator\u2019s \u201cfeeble response\u201d to the company\u2019s underfunding of its pension scheme, suggesting it required new leadership. The scheme, which has a deficit of \u00a32.6bn on some measures, has since been taken on by the government\u2019s lifeboat for struggling retirement funds, the Pension Protection Fund. In a section of the report devoted to the regulator, MPs said: \u201cIt has said it will be quicker, bolder and more proactive. It certainly needs to be. \u201cBut this will require substantial cultural change in an organisation where a tentative and apologetic approach is ingrained. \u201cWe are far from convinced that TPR\u2019s current leadership is equipped to effect that change.\u201d Titcomb, who earned \u00a3225,000 in 2016-17, including a bonus of up to \u00a320,000, had already promised to review the regulator\u2019s operations in a project called TPR Future. The review was launched after earlier criticism from MPs related to the failure of the department store chain BHS, which collapsed with a \u00a3571m pension deficit. She did not refer to the criticism she faced over BHS and Carillion, saying the time was right for her to stand down. \u201cThis has been a difficult personal decision taken after extensive discussion with family and the chairman,\u201d she said. \u201cI love working at TPR and am immensely proud of what we are achieving. But as I turn 57 next month, the end of my contract in February 2019 feels like the appropriate moment to find more time in my life for family, friends, other interests and opportunities.\u201d TPR chairman, Mark Boyle, said: \u201cWe respect her decision but will be very sorry to lose her. She has been a real catalyst for change, working with energy and drive to get results and make a difference to the way we work.\u201d",

Even so, his solution to the problem of co-owners having opinions is severe: Sorrell\u2019s complete control of S4 Capital, his new quoted venture, will be cemented via his sole ownership of a \u201cB\u201d share with the power to silence all formal dissent. As the document detailing the reverse takeover of cash shell Derriston puts it, the \u201cB\u201d share will give Sorrell the right to \u201censure no shareholder resolutions are proposed (save as required by law) or passed without his consent\u201d. That will make the annual meetings dull affairs and, in Sorrell\u2019s shoes, you can understand why he would prefer things that way. In his many \u201cI am an owner\u201d outbursts at WPP, he always seemed to resent the fact that his stake was diluted down from 15% at launch in 1985 to 2% in the later years. At S4 he will start with 75% of the regular class of share but, if the acquisitions roll in as intended, he can be diluted to minority status but still retain absolute authority. The \u201cB\u201d share arrangement will last for 14 years, or until he retires or dies. The backers, including Schroders, Miton, Lombard Odier and Lord Rothschild, are therefore taking a calculated gamble that it is worth their while to sign away their normal voting rights in the hope that an unchained Sorrell will succeed in his attempt to build \u201ca multinational communication services business focused on growth\u201d. The plot may indeed turn out happily but the fan club is taking a few obvious risks. The first is that S4 will achieve lift-off. During the turn-of-the-century market mania, four famous business figures led by Archie Norman, now the chair of M&amp;S, took over a cash shell called Knutsford with the aim of buying a major retailer but got precisely nowhere. S4\u2019s investors have signed non-binding commitments to supply another \u00a3150m of capital on top of the initial \u00a350m but that doesn\u2019t buy much in today\u2019s advertising world. Second, you have to believe Sorrell\u2019s deal-making skills are as sharp as they were in WPP\u2019s glory years. Lest we forget, WPP\u2019s share price fell by a third in his final year in charge. It\u2019s one thing to talk about the theoretical model for a 21st century digital marketing agency; it\u2019s another to assemble the best pieces from scratch at decent prices. The third risk comes from the undisclosed allegations of personal misconduct against Sorrell, which he denied, but which preceded his resignation last month. WPP and Sorrell have signed non-disclosure agreements and the backers can comfort themselves that their new leader departed with \u201cgood leaver\u201d status. Yet the investors cannot possibly judge the business or reputational risks for S4 that would flow from eventual disclosure, which is probably more likely to happen than not. In the circumstances, surrendering basic rights to hold the boss to account is extremely generous. There is no need for RBS rush job So much for theory that the Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive, Ross McEwan, would quit now that the bank has settled with the US Department of Justice and can contemplate paying dividends again. It is the other member of the double act, the finance director, Ewen Stevenson, who has resigned \u201cto take up an opportunity elsewhere\u201d. McEwan could still follow Stevenson out of the door, of course, but one must assume the chairman, Howard Davies, has secured a pledge that he\u2019s staying. Near-simultaneous departures are not the done thing and would probably delay the government\u2019s plan to flog a few RBS shares. Even as things stand, the sell-off may be on hold until upsets in the Italy bond market, which have knocked banks\u2019 share prices across Europe, have cleared. RBS has slipped from 296p to 276p since the middle of last week and the odd 20p matters when the nation\u2019s stake is worth the thick end of \u00a325bn. Wait for a rising market, chancellor.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of FirstGroup, which runs buses in numerous UK cities and the Great Western, South Western and TransPennine rail franchises, has been ousted after the company slumped to a \u00a3326m loss. The troubled Aberdeen-based rail and coach operator, which has said it is exploring options including a sale of the US bus group Greyhound, also said it remained committed to the TransPennine contract despite revealing it would lose more than \u00a3110m running the franchise. FirstGroup\u2019s share price fell 11% as investors took fright at the string of bad news and the company\u2019s financial prospects. The poor performance of the business, which reported a profit of \u00a3152m in the previous financial year to the end of March 2017, has cost its embattled chief executive his job. Tim O\u2019Toole, who has seen FirstGroup\u2019s share price slump 66% since his appointment in 2010, has resigned with immediate effect. \u201cThe time is right for me to step aside,\u201d O\u2019Toole said. \u201cToday\u2019s results clear the way for the new approach sought by our chairman and the board.\u201d He will be replaced by the executive chair, Wolfhart Hauser \u2013 who said the board was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the company\u2019s financial performance \u2013 while a successor is sought. \u201cThis year\u2019s results fell short of our ambitions \u2013 we are disappointed that we did not make the further progress we intended based on the trends we saw at the end of the previous financial year,\u201d Hauser said. Hauser, 68, said that after eight years it was not such a surprise that O\u2019Toole had left so abruptly. \u201cI think if you look at his age (62) it is not totally all of a sudden,\u201d he said. \u201cThe board thought at this time it is very important to have a fresh view in relation to strategy.\u201d Matthew Gregory, FirstGroup\u2019s finance chief, said external consultants had been appointed to review all options for the Greyhound business, including a sale. \u201cWe are not giving up the fight for this business,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a root-and-branch review and all options are on the table. Our obligation is to maximise value for shareholders.\u201d Profits at Greyhound slumped 39% to \u00a325.5m as the bus group\u2019s long-haul business took a battering amid increased competition from low-cost airlines in the US. FirstGroup made a \u00a3277m non-cash write-down on Greyhound to take into account the change in value of the business resulting from the shift in how people are choosing to travel. The company also made a \u00a3106m non-cash charge relating to the losses it believes it will rack up for the remainder of the life of the TransPennine rail contract, which runs until 2023. Gregory said FirstGroup was not seeking to hand back the contract for the heavily loss-making franchise, which it has run since 2016. It lost \u00a36.5m in the year to the end of March. \u201cAs of today we are committed to meeting the obligations of that franchise and are not walking away from it in any way, shape or form,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t rule out the losses will get to a higher level \u2013 or possibly get to a lower level \u2013 this is our best estimate at the moment.\u201d In April the group rejected a takeover approach from the US private equity group Apollo. Earlier this month, the shareholder West Face Capital urged FirstGroup to sell the \u00a31.4bn company, break it apart or spin off its North American operations. Net debt fell from \u00a31.3bn to \u00a31bn year on year. O\u2019Toole, who was paid \u00a31.26m in the previous financial year, will receive a payoff which will be revealed in FirstGroup\u2019s annual report next month. The company would not comment on the level of the payout. However, O\u2019Toole\u2019s contract stipulates a 12-month notice period, so he will be negotiating a portion of the \u00a31m he receives annually in pay and pension because of his sudden departure.",

The company would not comment on the level of the payout. However, O\u2019Toole\u2019s contract stipulates a 12-month notice period, so he will be negotiating a portion of the \u00a31m he receives annually in pay and pension because of his sudden departure.</p>",
