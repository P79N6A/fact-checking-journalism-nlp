      "bodyText": "The Labour party has said it would force big companies to publish full tax returns to expose any \u201csweetheart\u201d deals that firms arrange with the taxman to potentially reduce their tax bills. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said if Labour wins the next general election it would \u201cclose the loopholes through which large corporations swindle the public\u201d. He said the \u201ctax gap\u201d between what companies should be paying and what is actually received by the exchequer amounts to some \u00a336bn. Successive governments, including Theresa May\u2019s administration, have pledged to crack down on multinational companies gaming the international tax system to pay less tax. But accusations persist that some multinationals have been allowed to arrange so-called \u201csweetheart\u201d deals with firms, including Google, Vodafone and Starbucks, to pay nominal sums to settle investigations into allegations of years of tax avoidance. \u201cTax avoidance is a scourge on society that company secrecy laws help facilitate, and the Tories have done nothing to tackle it,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cLabour will pour the disinfectant of sunlight on large company accounts, helping close down the loopholes and the scams that the tax dodgers rely on. \u201cThe Tories are running a rigged economy for the super-rich and giant corporate tax dodgers. Only Labour will stand up for workers and small businesses to make our tax system fair and our public services like education and the NHS protected.\u201d Under Labour\u2019s plans all companies with more than \u00a336m in turnover or more than 250 employees would be required to file a complete tax return at Companies House along with annual accounts. Labour argued it was unfair that large companies are able to hire armies of accountants and lawyers and \u201cwine-and-dine senior civil servants\u201d in search of sweetheart deals, while smaller firms pay their taxes when they fall due. The publication of large company tax returns and related correspondence would expose any such deals, the opposition said. When parliament returns after the Easter recess on Tuesday, Labour will also push to strengthen measures to tackle tax avoidance in the finance bill. Peter Dowd, Labour\u2019s shadow chief secretary, said: \u201cThe measures in the finance bill claiming to close tax loopholes do not go far enough and have gaping omissions, another Tory conjuring trick to hide their inaction in making sure that everyone, including the rich, pays their fair share of society\u2019s upkeep. \u201cThere is nothing in the government\u2019s proposals to address the chronic lack of enforcement in the context of the wider regulatory problems. As usual, the Tories are playing rhetorically to the gallery.\u201d Responding to Labour\u2019s announcement, Conservative party vice-chairman, Stuart Andrew MP, said: \u201cThis government has a simple message for those who avoid tax: you must pay what you owe and we will make sure you do. \u201cAfter thirteen years of Labour doing nothing we have led the way on tackling tax evasion, avoidance and non-compliance, securing an additional \u00a3140bn in additional tax revenues since 2010. \u201cAll Labour would do now is wreck the economy with higher taxes, half a trillion in additional borrowing and a leader who says we should not be afraid of debt.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Falling retail sales and lower inflation in the US have added to signs that the world\u2019s biggest economy has lost momentum in recent months, casting doubt over how many more times the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. Stronger takings at clothing and electronics stores in March were not enough to offset a continued drop in demand for cars, according to figures from the US government (pdf). As a result, retail sales fell for the second month running. The 0.2% drop was deeper than forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists and followed a bigger than previously reported decline of 0.3% in February. Sales were also hurt by lower demand for building materials in March, chiming with a sharp slowdown in construction hiring as parts of the US were hit by severe snowstorms. Petrol station takings also dipped in March as fuel prices fell. The few bright spots were a 2.6% rise in takings at electronics and appliance stores and a 1% rise in clothing sales. The drop in fuel prices in March echoed a pattern seen in the UK following a fall in global oil prices last month. Cheaper pump prices were also a key factor in softer US inflation. A measure of prices in the US fell for the first time in more than a year, dipping 0.3% in March, according to figures from the Labor Department. It said falling fuel prices and mobile phone charges drove the decline in the consumer price index (CPI) and were only partially offset by rising food prices. As a result, inflation \u2013 or the pace of price changes over a year \u2013 eased to 2.4% in March from 2.7% in February. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, eased to 2% from 2.2% in February and was the weakest since November 2015. The retail sales and inflation data follow news of a sharp slowdown in job creation in the US in March as the poor weather, a government hiring freeze and a faltering retail sector all appeared to put a chill on President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to boost hiring. But the unemployment rate declined to 4.5%, the lowest rate in a decade. The latest indications that the economy slowed in the opening months of the year will give policymakers at the US central bank more to debate as they decide when to next raise interest rates. In March, the US Federal Reserve increased borrowing costs for the second time in three months, taking the base rate from 0.75% to 1%. It also indicated a series of further rises were still to come this year to keep inflation in check. The Fed\u2019s chair, Janet Yellen, said at the time of March\u2019s rate rise that a wide range of indicators showed the US economy was in rude health, clearing the path for policymakers to take rates back towards historically normal levels. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the Fed still looked on course to tighten monetary conditions further this summer. Responding to the latest retail and inflation data, he commented: \u201cSome Fed officials will be disturbed by the unexpected drop back in core CPI inflation in March, but this won\u2019t prevent a June rate hike, particularly as the fall was partly due to one-off changes and weather effects.\u201d He said the retail sales figures suggested real consumption \u201cbarely increased at all over the first quarter\u201d but noted that the underlying picture was still fairly robust. \u201cThe death of the US consumer is much exaggerated,\u201d Ashworth added.",

      "bodyText": "Credit Suisse bosses have cut their bonuses by 40% in the hope of avoiding an embarrassing protest by shareholders and politicians at the bank\u2019s annual meeting. The bank\u2019s executives, led by chief executive Tidjane Thiam, had proposed paying themselves bonuses totalling 78m Swiss francs (\u00a362m) even though the Swiss bank lost SFr2.7bn last year and has been fined $5.3bn (\u00a34.2bn) by the US authorities for its role in the subprime mortgage crisis. Institutional investors and Swiss politicians had publicly criticised the bumper payouts \u2013 including a total of SFr12m for Thiam - and vowed to vote against the awards at the bank\u2019s AGM later this month. The bank, which had defended the planned bonuses as recently as Thursday, announced it was reducing the awards early on Friday morning. \u201cI hope that this decision will alleviate some of the concerns expressed by some shareholders and will allow the executive team to continue to focus on the task at hand,\u201d Thiam said in a letter to investors published on the bank\u2019s website. \u201cMy highest priority is to see through the turnaround of Credit Suisse which is under way.\u201d Thiam conceded that the \u201cfinancial impact\u201d of the toxic mortgage settlement with the US Department of Justice was \u201cnot appropriately reflected in the compensation of current management\u201d. Thiam told Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft last month that \u201cmaking today\u2019s management pay for [the mis-selling of toxic mortgage securities] wouldn\u2019t be a good incentive\u201d. Three shareholder advisory services, including the influential Institutional Shareholder Service (ISS), had urged shareholders to vote down the pay awards. \u201cDespite a second consecutive net loss, variable remuneration levels for the executive board remained high, including a SFr4.17m short-term incentive for the CEO,\u201d said ISS, which advises more than 1,700 of the world\u2019s biggest investors. Shareholder votes on executive pay are binding in Switzerland. If Credit Suisse had lost the vote, it would have been the first major veto since the so-called \u201cfat cat law\u201d came into force four years ago and would serve as a major embarrassment for the bank. Thomas Minder, a Swiss politician who has led a revolt against excessive executive pay in the country, said the scale of proposed bonuses being offered by a loss-making company were a \u201cmortal sin\u201d. \u201cIf corporate governance is correct and the company has worked well and has a good annual result, then yes, some of [the profits] should be distributed,\u201d said Minder, who led a 2013 referendum resulting in the implementation of the binding shareholder vote on executive pay. \u201cBut if it worked badly, like Credit Suisse, then, dear me, nothing can be allowed to be paid out.\u201d Minder told Reuters: \u201cIf there\u2019s no money in the coffers, then there are no bonuses for top management or employees. That is a mortal sin.\u201d Thiam, who was previously boss of insurance giant Prudential, said: \u201cOur decision [to cut the bonus pool] reflects the total confidence we have in the progress we are making. Although that progress is not yet reflected in our share price, I am confident that our strategy and our disciplined execution will in due course create value for you, our shareholders.\u201d Credit Suisse\u2019s shares have lost more than 11% of their value over the past year. Excessive boardroom pay has moved up the British political agenda since the financial crisis of 2008. Last year, the prime minister, Theresa May, stated an ambition to crack down on poor corporate governance in the UK. May had called for annual binding shareholder votes on executive pay to end the \u201cirrational, unhealthy and growing gap between what these companies pay their workers and what they pay their bosses\u201d and to help \u201cmake our economy work for everyone\u201d. However, a government green paper on corporate governance reform published in November backed away from a binding shareholder vote at AGMs.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The roots of Toshiba\u2019s admission this week that it has serious doubts over its \u201cability to continue as a going concern\u201d can be found near two small US towns. It is the four reactors being built for nuclear power stations outside Waynesboro, in Georgia, and Jenkinsville, South Carolina, by the company\u2019s US subsidiary Westinghouse that have left the Japanese corporation facing an annual loss of \u00a37.37bn. Construction work on the units has run hugely over budget and over schedule, casting a shadow over two of the biggest new nuclear power station projects in the US for years. Events came to a head last month when Westinghouse was forced to file for bankruptcy protection to limit Toshiba\u2019s losses. Westinghouse\u2019s problems in Waynesboro and Jenkinsville could provide a cautionary tale for the UK, which is also embarking on a nuclear power station-building programme. Experts said the delays and cost problems were due to America\u2019s lack of recent experience in building atomic power plants. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is necessarily because of an inherent issue of US skills but rather the lack of practice,\u201d said Richard Nephew, a professor at the Centre on Global Energy Policy, Columbia University. \u201cThere simply have not been as many new reactor builds in the US and this has reduced the overall pool of skilled labor, no question.\u201d The absence of a mass production supply chain, due to the small number of the Westinghouse-designed reactors being built, played a part too, he added. Regulatory issues had also delayed construction. Toshiba\u2019s losses stem from Westinghouse\u2019s acquisition in 2015 of the nuclear construction business CB&amp;I Stone &amp; Webster, which it hoped would solve the delays on the two sites. That deal has now backfired spectacularly, pushing Westinghouse and its parent company to the brink of financial collapse. The regulator for one of the projects, Plant Vogtle, in Georgia, has said Westinghouse\u2019s bankruptcy means the project will require more \u201ctime and money\u201d. Meanwhile the utility company paying for the Virgil C Summer Nuclear Generating Station, near Jenkinsville, South Carolina, warned this week that abandonment of the project was one of the options it was now considering. Nephew said: \u201cThis experience may push the US into a different model, perhaps focused on smaller modular reactors, or less complicated designs.\u201d The US energy secretary, Rick Perry, signalled the Trump administration\u2019s support for nuclear this week, issuing a statement at the G7 summit in which he said the US backed \u201cadvanced civil-nuclear technologies\u201d. That suggested support for next-generation reactors rather than the sort being built by Westinghouse. Richard Morningstar, chairman of the Global Energy Centre at the international affairs thinktank Atlantic Council, said: \u201cWhat is happening to Westinghouse and Toshiba only emphasises the need to double down on research on new, safe, nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors. If we do not do so in the US, leadership will be ceded to other countries.\u201d One such aspiring atomic leader is the UK, where the government wants to build a new generation of nuclear power stations to help satisfy the country\u2019s power needs for decades to come. But there are obvious parallels between the two countries on the issues of recent experience and supply chains. The UK has not completed a new nuclear power station since Sizewell B on the Suffolk coast started generating power in 1995. EDF, the French state-owned company which has started pouring concrete at Hinkley Point in Somerset, where it plans to have two reactors operational by 2025, maintains it has had plenty of recent practice. The EPR reactor design for Hinkley is the same as that for the reactors it is building in Finland, and at Flamanville, in France, though both of those are running late and over budget. The other new nuclear projects proposed around the UK, all by foreign companies, look less certain and all are still years from construction starting in earnest. Toshiba said this week it would consider selling its shares in the consortium behind another plant planned at Moorside, in Cumbria, which would utilise three of the same AP1000 Westinghouse reactors being built for the two crisis-hit US plants. The South Korean power company Kepco last month expressed an interest in buying into the project, and the business secretary , Greg Clark, went to South Korea last week for talks on collaboration on nuclear power. However, any rescue by Seoul is far from certain. The two leading candidates in South Korea\u2019s elections in May said this week that they favoured rowing back on nuclear power and switching to renewable energy. Kepco would also face a regulatory delay of several years if it wanted to use its own technology at Moorside. Unions in the UK said the uncertainty showed that the government should intervene more directly, by taking a stake in Moorside. Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary, said: \u201cThe big moral of the story is what on earth we are doing as a country, leaving our fundamental energy requirements to foreign companies or foreign governments?\u201d While the government has argued that it has plans in place to keep the lights on if new nuclear projects do not materialise, others said the deepening crisis at Toshiba this week showed the need for ministers to consider a new energy policy. \u201cIt\u2019s time to come up with a new plan A,\u201d said Paul Dorfman, of the Energy Institute, at University College London, who believes the Moorside project is dead. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a viable strategy that talks about grid upgrades, solar, energy efficiency, and energy management.\u201d A report published on Thursday highlighted another alternative: a U-turn on the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto commitment to block new onshore windfarms. Analysis for the trade body Scottish Renewables suggested wind turbines on land had become so cheap they could be built for little or no subsidy, compared to the lucrative contract awarded to EDF for Hinkley. But the prospect of a rethink by the government on wind power looks about as likely as new nuclear power stations being built on time.",

The UK has not completed a new nuclear power station since <a href=\"https://www.edfenergy.com/energy/power-stations/sizewell-b\">Sizewell B on the Suffolk coast started generating power in 1995</a>.</p> <p>EDF, the French state-owned company which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2017/mar/31/striking-drone-footage-shows-hinkley-point-c-under-construction-video\">has started pouring concrete</a> at Hinkley Point in Somerset, where it plans to have two reactors operational by 2025, maintains it has had plenty of recent practice.</p> <p>The EPR reactor design for Hinkley is the same as that for the reactors it is building in Finland, and at Flamanville, in France, though both of those are running late and over budget.</p> <p>The other new nuclear projects proposed around the UK, all by foreign companies, look less certain and all are still years from construction starting in earnest. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/04/toshiba-moorside-nuclear-nugen-engie-reactor\">Toshiba said this week</a> it would consider selling its shares in the consortium behind another plant planned at Moorside, in Cumbria, which would utilise three of the same AP1000 Westinghouse reactors being built for the two crisis-hit US plants.</p> <p>The South Korean power company Kepco last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/25/foreign-firms-flock-to-build-nuclear-plants-in-uk\">expressed an interest in buying into the project</a>, and the business secretary , Greg Clark, went to South Korea last week for talks on collaboration on nuclear power.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/05/uk-energy-projects-hinkley-point-threatened-brexit-experts-warn\">Energy projects including Hinkley Point threatened by Brexit, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, any rescue by Seoul is far from certain.

Kepco would also face a regulatory delay of several years if it wanted to use its own technology at Moorside.</p> <p>Unions in the UK said the uncertainty showed that the government should intervene more directly, by taking a stake in Moorside. </p> <p>Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary, said: \u201cThe big moral of the story is what on earth we are doing as a country, leaving our fundamental energy requirements to foreign companies or foreign governments?\u201d</p> <p>While the government has argued that it has plans in place to keep the lights on if new nuclear projects do not materialise, others said the deepening crisis at Toshiba this week showed the need for ministers to consider a new energy policy. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to come up with a new plan A,\u201d said Paul Dorfman, of the Energy Institute, at University College London, who believes the Moorside project is dead. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a viable strategy that talks about grid upgrades, solar, energy efficiency, and energy management.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.scottishrenewables.com/publications/baringa-sr-analysis-potential-outcome-pot-1-cfd-/\">A report published on Thursday</a> highlighted another alternative: a U-turn on the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto commitment to block new onshore windfarms. Analysis for the trade body Scottish Renewables suggested wind turbines on land had become so cheap they could be built for little or no subsidy, compared to the lucrative contract awarded to EDF for Hinkley.</p> <p>But the prospect of a rethink by the government on wind power looks about as likely as new nuclear power stations being built on time.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The former owners of Bernard Matthews \u201clined their own pockets\u201d by rejecting a takeover offer that would have protected the turkey producer\u2019s pension scheme in favour of an insolvency process that ensured a greater return for themselves, MPs have claimed. The influential Commons work and pensions select committee said that the move by private equity firm Rutland Partners, which sold the company\u2019s assets for \u00a387.5m via a \u201cpre-pack\u201d administration last year, resulted in the 700 members of the scheme facing large cuts to their retirement income. The Pension Protection Fund, an industry-backed body that acts as a safety net for the pensions of insolvent companies, is now assessing what money can be recovered from the carcass of the insolvent Bernard Matthews Ltd as part of a process that typically takes years. Frank Field MP, the chairman of the committee, said: \u201cI have confidence that the PPF, working with the scheme trustees, will act in the best interests of the pensioners, but it\u2019s clear that the former owners passed up a better deal for pension scheme members in favour of lining their own pockets.\u201d The pension fund is reported to have had a deficit of about \u00a320m when the company collapsed, although that is thought to have grown to as much as \u00a340m. It is estimated that it could cost as much as \u00a375m for the scheme to be bought out and run by a private insurance firm. Currently, the fund is only due to receive 1p in the pound, as part of the pre-pack model arranged by administrators Deloitte. A briefing note prepared for the committee in October by Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: \u201cThe administration strategy seems to have been carefully crafted to enable secured creditors and controllers of Bernard Matthews to extract maximum cash from the company and dump the pension scheme and other liabilities. \u201cNo attention has been paid to the hardship caused to retired and existing employees. It is all too easy for companies, their directors and shareholders to extract cash and dump pension obligations to employees, leaving the Pension Protection Fund or taxpayers to foot the bill, and effectively boost returns to corporate elites.\u201d Rutland Partners, which sold the Bernard Matthews assets to the multi-millionaire food tycoon Ranjit Boparan in September, declined to comment. In a letter to Field, Deloitte said that the pre-pack administration saw the transfer of more than 1,800 employees to Boparan Private Office and that with \u201ca trading administration alternative, there would have been no guarantee of saving any employment\u201d. BPO, which also wrote to Field last month, said: \u201cBPO made an offer to acquire the whole of the share capital of Bernard Matthews which would have entailed BPO taking on the Bernard Matthews pension scheme and its deficit, but this offer was rejected by Rutland and its advisers. \u201cMr Boparan takes his responsibilities with regard to pension commitments extremely seriously and this can be evidenced by the way that he has increased his funding to the Northern Foods pension scheme since its acquisition by BHL [Boparan Holdings Limited, another family vehicle].\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A group of former BHS workers have altogether won up to \u00a31m in compensation over the summary way they were made redundant when the retailer collapsed. A London employment tribunal awarded 110 employees at the firm\u2019s head office up to 90 days\u2019 wages after their lawyers successfully argued that the company did not conduct a proper consultation process with them ahead of their dismissal. The employees were represented by the law firm JWK, which successfully argued that BHS failed to fulfil its legal duty to consult with staff for at least 45 days before making them redundant when the retailer collapsed last April. The tribunal ruled there had been \u201ca complete failure to consult\u201d and that the claimants should receive the maximum protective award. \u201cWe are very pleased that the claim has been successful and that the claimants will at last receive some compensation for the way they were treated,\u201d said JWK\u2019s director, Carl Moran. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complex area of law and we were pleased to assist in achieving this just outcome.\u201d JWK brought the claim against BHS and the government on behalf of former staff. The business department therefore will have to hand the staff the equivalent of 40 days\u2019 pay, and the defunct company\u2019s estate will be liable for the remaining 50 days\u2019 money. Payments will vary in size depending on salaries but the government\u2019s contribution is capped at \u00a33,800 per person. When BHS collapsed into administration a year ago, with the loss of 11,000 job losses, it was the biggest high-street failure since that of Woolworths, which went into administration in 2008. The retailer had been owned by Sir Philip Green for 15 years until he sold it to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt, for just \u00a31 in March 2015. The retailer lasted just a year under the control of Chappell\u2019s consortium and its unravelling finances would become the subject of a high-profile parliamentary inquiry which concluded that the company had been systematically plundered by its owners. During his ownership, the Green family and other shareholders collected at least \u00a3580m from BHS in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans. Green recently resolved the long-running row over the hole in the BHS pension fund deficit by agreeing to hand over \u00a3363m in cash to rescue it. It is not the first time there has been a clash between insolvency and employment regulation. In 2014 Comet workers won a multimillion pound payout after a tribunal ruled that the company and its administrator, Deloitte, failed to consult staff properly when nearly 7,000 people were made redundant in 2012. The Leeds employment tribunal awarded staff up to 90 days\u2019 pay, ruling that staff were misinformed and some made redundant within hours of being consulted. In 2016 lawyers also won an employment tribunal claim on behalf of 340 City Link employees over the failure to properly consult when the parcel delivery firm imploded on Christmas Eve.",
