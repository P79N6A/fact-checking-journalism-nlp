      "bodyText": "British businesses have warned that Brexit will trigger investment cuts, hiring freezes and redundancies as the consequences of leaving the European Union threaten to destabilise markets further this week. The survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD), which found that the majority of businesses believed Brexit was bad for them, comes amid fears that investors will wipe billions more pounds off share values on Monday morning, and signs that the pound, which hit a 30-year low on Friday, was coming under further pressure from trading in Asia. Sterling was down more than 1% as the Asian markets opened late on Sunday. George Osborne will make a statement on Monday morning \u200eto provide reassurance about financial and economic stability in light of the referendum result and the actions that he and the rest of the government will be taking to protect the national interest over the coming period. The IoD said a quarter of the members polled in a survey were putting hiring plans on hold, while 5% said they were set to make workers redundant. Nearly two-thirds of those polled said the outcome of the referendum was negative for their business. One in five respondents, out of a poll of more than 1,000 business leaders, were considering moving some of their operations outside of the UK. In preparation for further turmoil on the markets after a record $2tn (\u00a31.5tn) was wiped off global share prices on Friday, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, was expected to abandon plans to travel to a meeting of central bankers and policy makers organised by the European Central Bank in Portugal on Wednesday. He will remain in London to oversee the response to the uncertainty. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares is expected to fall by 2.8%, or around 180 points, when the market opens on Monday. City dealers are expected to arrive at their desks early to cope with an anticipated surge in orders, and analysts will be closely monitoring the pound, after it came under pressure in early trading on Sunday. Central bank bosses meeting in Switzerland have said they will carefully scrutinise market stability in the weeks ahead. Meanwhile, fears are spreading that an estimated 100,000 roles could be lost in the financial sector if banks press on with contingency plans to move jobs out of the UK. The political uncertainty gripping the UK following the resignation of prime minister David Cameron and turmoil in the Labour party has put the City on alert for more volatility. With fears that the economic turmoil following the result will tip the country into recession, the snap poll of IoD members found that company bosses were considering a range of options, including hiring and investment freezes and relocating some of their operations. Simon Walker, the IoD\u2019s director general, said the organisation would not \u201csugar-coat\u201d the damaging outcome: \u201cA majority of business leaders think the vote for Brexit is bad for them.\u201d \u201cBusinesses will be busy working out how they are going to adapt and succeed after the referendum result,\u201d said Walker of the group which has 34,500 members, ranging from start-up entrepreneurs to chief executives of multinational companies. \u201cBut we can\u2019t sugar-coat this, many of our members are feeling anxious.\u201d In the poll, 36% of IoD members said the outcome of last Thursday\u2019s vote would lead them to cut investment in their business whereas just 9% said the opposite was true. Just under half said it would not change their investment plans. The IoD board and its council, which is a conduit for members\u2019 views, will meet on Monday to discuss the fallout from the vote. Three-quarters of members polled said they felt the priority for business leaders was to take steps to protect the economy from the negative reaction in financial markets, with securing a new trade arrangement with the EU coming second to that. Business lobby group the CBI has also said it was speaking to its members as the UK stared at several years of economic uncertainty. \u201cThere is no point crying over spilled milk,\u201d said Walker. \u201cBut these results highlight the importance of the Bank of England maintaining stability in the financial system. It is crucial that the banks do not starve businesses of cash. During the referendum campaign we were promised an open and outward-looking country after Brexit, now it must be delivered [by David Cameron\u2019s successor].\u201d Carney sought to calm jittery financial markets with a public address on Friday morning by insisting banks were in better shape than they were before the 2008 financial crisis and that there was an extra \u00a3250bn available to ensure that financial institutions did not run short of cash. He spent part of the weekend with other central bank governors at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The last of three extra lending facilities announced by Carney ahead of the referendum takes place on Tuesday, while the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee set up to monitor risks to the financial system also meets this week. Banks are preparing to shift roles out of London amid the uncertainty about whether the UK can keep its \u201cpassporting\u201d rights allowing them to operate across the EU. US bank JP Morgan has warned 4,000 jobs will go and HSBC has said 1,000 City jobs will move to France. Rumours are sweeping the City that alternative trading sites are being set up in a number of other financial centres, including Luxembourg. Jonathan Hill, who resigned as EU commissioner for finance, told the Financial Times that the City should be ready to have rules imposed upon it by eurozone countries. Analysts said that Brexit should not spark the chaos which followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. \u201cPolicymakers and companies have had time to make contingency plans, even if they can\u2019t fully offset the impact,\u201d said analysts at at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. However, the analysts expect the pound to fall another 10% \u201cover time\u201d and the euro by half that amount. Even so, the markets are being closed watched. Agust\u00edn Carstens, the head of the Mexican central bank and chair of the global committee of central bankers, said he and his colleagues would \u201ccarefully monitor market functioning and stability\u201d to prevent the shock verdict of British voters spilling over into a market panic. The British Chambers of Commerce warned a prolonged period of uncertainty would hit confidence levels, investment and job creation. Andrew Hood, a senior director at the law firm Dechert and a former adviser to the prime minister on international issues, was reported as saying: \u201cBig technology and manufacturing firms are concerned that they are going to get squeezed if the UK focuses too much on keeping financial services.\u201d Hood said he had already heard of three deals being put on indefinite hold. There were also reports that investors in technology start-ups in the UK were pulling out because the funds were contingent on Britain remaining in the EU.",

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel is close to a deal to save its Port Talbot plant despite Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, as sterling\u2019s slump potentially boosts the industry\u2019s survival prospects. MPs and trade unions have said the steel industry faces a new crisis after the referendum result, with bidders for Tata Steel UK ready to pull out of the process, according to reports. Sources familiar with Tata Steel\u2019s thinking, however, say the company is still working on a deal with the government to keep its UK business, and that the slump in sterling\u2019s value could help the industry. More than 11,000 jobs are at risk after Tata Steel announced in March that it was considering pulling out of its UK business, which includes the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales. The company began a sales process for the business, and seven potential bidders were shortlisted, but it has decided to work on a deal to keep its UK concern after the government pledged to offer hundreds of millions of pounds of support and restructure the company\u2019s pension scheme. A senior source close to the Indian company said it was still likely to keep the business, which would be a boost to the beleaguered Conservative government, whose efforts to help Port Talbot have been criticised. The source said: \u201cUnless something drastic happens, then early next week they will make a statement.\u201d The company believes the impact of Britain voting to leave the EU, which threatens to spark years of uncertainty for businesses, could be softened by the weakening of sterling. The pound fell to its lowest levels in 30 years against the dollar on Friday, which means it will be more expensive for China to export steel to Britain. Cheap imports from China have been one of the factors behind the crisis facing the steel industry. It is understood, however, that Tata Steel\u2019s main concern is whether the government will be strong enough to push through changes to the British Steel pension scheme, which need to be enshrined in law. The latest figures show the deficit has ballooned to \u00a3700m, up from \u00a3485m last year, and its liabilities are almost \u00a315bn. Under the government\u2019s plan, drawn up with trustees and trade unions, the scheme would be spun off into a new \u201cshell\u201d company and the inflation-linked annual increase benchmarked against the consumer price index rather than the retail price index, potentially saving billions of pounds in future liabilities. The pension protection fund and some MPs, however, have said this could create a dangerous precedent and encourage other companies to walk away from their pension liabilities. A spokesman for Tata Steel said the company was \u201ccommitted to developing the best prospects possible for our UK operations\u201d. \u201cDecisions by the UK electorate will always be respected by Tata Steel. Whatever the political framework, we are committed to developing the best prospects possible for our UK operations,\u201d he said. However, politicians in Wales and Westminster are concerned that a rescue deal for Port Talbot could fall apart. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP who has campaigned for the future of the steel industry, said Brexit could cause it \u201cirreparable damage\u201d. \u201cThe vote has taken place, the people have spoken, but I am deeply, deeply concerned about the future of our steelworks in the light of this vote,\u201d Kinnock told BBC Radio Wales. Some of the bidders for Tata Steel UK are close to abandoning their talks with the Indian company after the referendum. Many were already frustrated by the sale process, however, and the growing likelihood that Tata Steel would keep the business. The billionaire tycoon Wilbur Ross has signalled that he is ready to withdraw from the process, according to Sky News. However, Liberty House, which is run by Sanjeev Gupta, is still committed. Gareth Stace, the director of the trade body UK Steel, has said the steel industry faces its biggest ever challenge because of the referendum result. He said: \u201cThe decision to leave the European Union will send shockwaves across the UK\u2019s steel industry. Our sector is well versed in having challenges thrust upon it, but it\u2019s clear that this is like no other.\u201d Stace said: \u201cIt is now more essential than ever to create the right business conditions in the UK that allow the steel industry to survive, invest and thrive. This will ensure that our vital supply chains, such as defence, automotive and construction, can rely on the production of steel in the UK so we are self-sufficient and can never be left at the mercy of others. \u201cGovernment now needs to fully and finally tackle head-on the uncompetitive electricity and policy costs that have historically hindered the growth of steel producers and seen thousands of high-skilled jobs lost over the last year. Government can now match words with actions and take the lead in dealing with subsidised exports, most notably from China, that are slowly destroying steelmaking in the UK.\u201d",

In its annual report, the BIS \u2013 which is known as the central bank of central banks \u2013 said a repeat of the 2008 financial crash was possible unless the growing reliance on near-zero interest rates to keep the global economy afloat was eased by ministers stepping in to shoulder greater responsibility. It said unwarranted gloom about growth in the global economy, which it argued had returned to historical averages, was preventing governments from pressing ahead with reforms. The warning echoes reports by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD). They have chided governments for doing little more than impose austerity to balance their budgets while refraining from making strategic decisions to develop more sustainable growth. \u201cWe need policies that we will not once again regret when the future becomes today,\u201d the BIS said in a 258-page examination of global economic trends and the health of the financial services industry. It warned that ministers needed to act quickly as the post-crash recovery began to run out of steam with commodity prices falling, the dollar strengthening and global liquidity starting to tighten. The BIS chief, Claudio Borio, said: \u201cThere are worrying developments, a sort of \u2018risky trinity\u2019, that bear watching: productivity growth that is unusually low, casting a shadow over future improvements in living standards; global debt levels that are historically high, raising financial stability risks; and room for policy manoeuvre that is remarkably narrow, leaving the global economy highly exposed.\u201d He argued that while growth across developing and developed world economies had failed to recapture its previous rapid pace, it still remained robust and offered governments scope to tackle long-term issues. An overhaul of corporate taxes and subsidies was needed \u201cto remove the bias towards debt accumulation, for example by eliminating the tax advantage of debt over equity,\u201d he added. A longstanding emphasis on fighting inflation by central banks was also part of the problem when the main issue was growth and jobs. Hyun Song Shin, the BIS\u2019s head of research, said: \u201cThere is an implicit assumption that inflation at 2% is the best measure of slack in the economy, and that the economy gets sucked into a downward spiral when inflation hits zero. But this may not be the right inference. We should be looking at growth and looking at employment, too.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A lame-duck prime minister; a (so far) silent chancellor; an opposition party in turmoil; a possible general election in the autumn that could produce a hung parliament; and the threat of a second referendum in Scotland. Do not be surprised if financial markets take a second look at Brexit and decide that Friday\u2019s initial response was too tame. The $2tn (\u00a31.5tn) of stockmarket value removed around the world is a large figure, of course. But the reaction wasn\u2019t as dramatic as some had feared \u2013 the FTSE 100 index ended the week higher than it started, for example. Investors may think again. They already knew that the old image of the UK political landscape \u2013 basically stable and predictable, at least by comparison with most of Europe \u2013 had suffered a jolt. But they may not have been prepared for the size of the earthquake. Expect aftershocks. Fund managers \u2013 or, at least, those who take a long view \u2013 have tended to make two points about Brexit. First, that the exact terms of the UK\u2019s exit will be the important thing. Yes, a short-term economic hiccup \u2013 even a mild recession \u2013 would be possible but proper judgments could only be made when the UK and EU get down to hard bargaining. On that score, it was encouraging that German chancellor Angela Merkel, in contrast to many EU leaders, said she would not press for a quickie divorce. Her cautious tone carried a pleasing hint (for markets) that mutually beneficial commercial interests would be uppermost in the coming talks and that the German business establishment had reminded Berlin that the country has a substantial trade surplus with the UK. But fund managers\u2019 second point about the post-Brexit world was this: the UK government had to enter the talks with a clear idea of what it wanted. The moment to worry would be if the UK leave camp started to squabble within itself. On that front, the events of the weekend look alarming. The Brexiters have won the referendum but seem to have little idea of what to do after victory. Do they want access to the EU single market or not? We have heard endless claims that the UK, armed with a bigger economy and greater negotiating clout, can secure a better deal than Switzerland, Norway or Canada. But nobody has agreed what this model might be. A degree of vagueness was inevitable, but there is a world of difference between constructive ambiguity and not having any concrete negotiating principles. In the City, they can see the threats close up. London is the current financial capital of Europe, but now Britain\u2019s Jonathan Hill is no longer the commissioner in charge of financial services. On his way out, Hill has warned the City to prepare for an era in which the French and Germans write the financial rules. Would the UK government, whatever its makeup, be prepared to accept that outcome if it can secure tariff-free access to EU markets for, say, the country\u2019s carmakers? Nobody knows, but the toe-to-toe negotiations could come down to such hard choices, all of which carry heavy implications for the Treasury\u2019s tax revenues. It is possible to take the opposite view. The democratic process always carries the risk of shocks but it usually resolves crises eventually. Maybe the big losers in Friday\u2019s stock market shakeout \u2013 the big banks and housebuilders \u2013 were over-sold. The banks are better capitalised these days and the Bank of England, at least, seems to have done its thinking about Brexit in advance. As for houses, the UK will still need to build them, and a government of any colour may still wave financial incentives. Share prices in those corners of the market could bounce. But watch sterling, which is a better gauge of how international investors view the UK\u2019s prospects. Friday\u2019s 8% fall against the dollar was sharp but, versus some expectations, not severe. At $1.37, it still well above the eye-catching predictions that $1.20 lies in store. Mark Carney at the Bank will also be watching closely, one suspects. The exchange rate will strongly influence the UK\u2019s short-term inflation outlook. The Bank can only start to think sensibly about interest rates and other policy responses when sterling starts to stabilise.",

Do not be surprised if financial markets take a second look at Brexit and decide that Friday\u2019s initial response was too tame.</p> <p>The $2tn (\u00a31.5tn) of stockmarket value removed around the world is a large figure, of course. But the reaction wasn\u2019t as dramatic as some had feared \u2013 the FTSE 100 index ended the week higher than it started, for example. Investors may think again. They already knew that the old image of the UK political landscape \u2013 basically stable and predictable, at least by comparison with most of Europe \u2013 had suffered a jolt. But they may not have been prepared for the size of the earthquake. Expect aftershocks.</p> <p>Fund managers \u2013 or, at least, those who take a long view \u2013 have tended to make two points about Brexit. First, that the exact terms of the UK\u2019s exit will be the important thing. Yes, a short-term economic hiccup \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/brexit-vote-leaves-uk-on-brink-of-recession-economists-say\">even a mild recession</a> \u2013 would be possible but proper judgments could only be made when the UK and EU get down to hard bargaining.</p> <p>On that score, it was encouraging that German chancellor Angela Merkel, in contrast to many EU leaders, said she would not press for a quickie divorce. Her cautious tone carried a pleasing hint (for markets) that mutually beneficial commercial interests would be uppermost in the coming talks and that the German business establishment had reminded Berlin that the country has a substantial trade surplus with the UK.</p> <p>But fund managers\u2019 second point about the post-Brexit world was this: the UK government had to enter the talks with a clear idea of what it wanted. The moment to worry would be if the UK leave camp started to squabble within itself. On that front, the events of the weekend look alarming. The Brexiters have won the referendum but seem to have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/conservative-leadership-rift-widens-brexit\">little idea of what to do after victory</a>.</p> <p>Do they want access to the EU single market or not? We have heard endless claims that the UK, armed with a bigger economy and greater negotiating clout, can secure a better deal than Switzerland, Norway or Canada. But nobody has agreed what this model might be. A degree of vagueness was inevitable, but there is a world of difference between constructive ambiguity and not having any concrete negotiating principles.</p> <p>In the City, they can see the threats close up. London is the current financial capital of Europe, but now Britain\u2019s Jonathan Hill is no longer the commissioner in charge of financial services. On his way out, Hill has warned the City to prepare for an era in which the French and Germans write the financial rules.</p> <p>Would the UK government, whatever its makeup, be prepared to accept that outcome if it can secure tariff-free access to EU markets for, say, the country\u2019s carmakers? Nobody knows, but the toe-to-toe negotiations could come down to such hard choices, all of which carry heavy implications for the Treasury\u2019s tax revenues.</p> <p>It is possible to take the opposite view. The democratic process always carries the risk of shocks but it usually resolves crises eventually. Maybe the big losers in Friday\u2019s stock market shakeout \u2013 the big banks and housebuilders \u2013 were over-sold. The banks are better capitalised these days and the Bank of England, at least, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/24/bank-of-england-mark-carney-says-brexit-contingency-plans-under-way\">seems to have done its thinking about Brexit in advance</a>. As for houses, the UK will still need to build them, and a government of any colour may still wave financial incentives. Share prices in those corners of the market could bounce. </p> <p>But watch sterling, which is a better gauge of how international investors view the UK\u2019s prospects. Friday\u2019s 8% fall against the dollar was sharp but, versus some expectations, not severe. At $1.37, it still well above the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/19/eu-referendum-nobel-prize-winning-economists-warn-of-long-term-brexit-damage\">eye-catching predictions that $1.20 lies in store</a>. Mark Carney at the Bank will also be watching closely, one suspects. The exchange rate will strongly influence the UK\u2019s short-term inflation outlook. The Bank can only start to think sensibly about interest rates and other policy responses when sterling starts to stabilise.</p>",

Jack Wills targets affluent teens and university students with \u00a3200 tweed blazers and \u00a360 hoodies. It grew in popularity at the start of the century, but has been loss-making for several years and closed down sister brand Aubin &amp; Wills in 2012.

Williams founded the business, which is named after his grandfather Jack Williams, with university friend Robert Shaw. The first store was opened in Salcombe, Devon in 1999. Williams told one interviewer that the brand aimed to \u201cbottle what being at a British university was all about and all the cool amazing stuff that goes with that\u201d. However, it recently fell foul of the advertising watchdog, which banned a catalogue that featured images of young people drinking and partying in their underwear. Williams returned as chief executive of Jack Wills last summer following the departure of Wendy Becker after two years in the post. The business is chaired by Lord Davies, the former chairman of Standard Chartered. Inflexion is said to be keen to dispose of a shareholding it has owned since 2007. Jack Wills abandoned plans to list on the Stock Exchange last year and the market turmoil caused by the Brexit vote could stall dealmaking in the City for the foreseeable future.

    "webTitle": "MPs to scrutinise Sir Philip Green's link with influential banker", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The relationship between one of Britain\u2019s most influential bankers and Sir Philip Green will be thrown into the spotlight this week as MPs deepen their investigation into the collapse of BHS. Michael Sherwood, the vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs, will appear before a parliamentary committee on Wednesday to answer questions about his ties with Green. Sherwood is the co-head of Goldman\u2019s European business and has advised Green for more than a decade. He worked on the tycoon\u2019s failed attempt to buy Marks &amp; Spencer in 2004. Sherwood will appear alongside Anthony Gutman, the co-head of investment banking for Goldman in Europe, and Michael Casey, another Goldman banker. Goldman has been thrown into the centre of the BHS scandal after Green claimed he \u201cone million per cent\u201d would not have sold the department store chain to Dominic Chappell if the prospective buyer had not passed an informal vetting by the bank. Chappell has been declared bankrupt three times and had no experience of running a retail business before buying BHS. BHS collapsed into administration in April, putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green controlled BHS for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 in March 2015 to Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions. There is growing anger about the collapse of BHS because Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rental payments and interest during the tycoon\u2019s period in charge. Retail Acquisitions also collected at least \u00a317m from the retailer despite owning it for just 13 months. MPs are investigating how the BHS\u2019s pension scheme ended up heavily in deficit and why Green sold the company to Chappell. The Goldman trio will be grilled on claims by Retail Acquisitions and its advisers that the bank acted as the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d for Green during the sale process. Gutman will be appearing in front of the the joint hearing of the business, innovation and skills committee, and the work and pensions committee, for the second time. He initially told MPs last month that Goldman had offered only \u201cinformal assistance\u201d to Green and had not been paid for its work. However, it subsequently emerged that Goldman\u2019s work involved 79 emails, 13 calls, and three meetings, including a \u201ccongratulations\u201d email from Gutman to Chappell when Retail Acquisitions completed its deal to buy BHS. MPs will also hear from a string of other witnesses this week who are connected to Green or the BHS scandal. This includes Neville Kahn of accountancy firm Deloitte, another key adviser to Green, and Brett Palos, the tycoon\u2019s stepson. Palos is a non-executive director of Arcadia, Green\u2019s retail business. He bought a BHS shop in Ealing, west London, for \u00a36.9m just days before the Retail Acquisitions deal and sold it for a \u00a33m profit just weeks later. Chappell told MPs he was shocked when he found out that Palos had been behind the property deal. Other witnesses to appear will include Alex Dellal, who runs Allied Commercial Exporters (Ace). Dellal helped to finance Retail Acquisition\u2019s takeover of BHS by providing \u00a335m that the consortium used to demonstrate its credibility to Green. Ace then went on to make an estimated \u00a316m profit from a series of property deals and loan agreements with BHS and Retail Acquisitions. Paul Sutton, who introduced Chappell to Green, will also answer questions from MPs. Sutton was in talks to buy BHS from Green until a whistleblower handed over a dossier to the billionaire that showed Sutton had been convicted of fraud in France. Chappell then stepped in to buy the retailer. MPs have recalled Arcadia executives and the head of the Pensions Regulator for further questions about the collapse of BHS. The recalled Arcadia witnesses are Paul Budge, the finance director, and Chris Harris, the property director. Lesley Titcomb, the chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, will be asked to explain what steps were taken to restructure the BHS pension scheme before Green sold the company, and what action could be taken against the tycoon to fill the \u00a3571m deficit. Green told MPs he would \u201csort\u201d the pension problems facing BHS, but a plan is yet to emerge. \u201cNothing is more sad than how this has ended,\u201d Green said. \u201cThere is certainly no intent at all on my part for anything to be like this, and it didn\u2019t need to be like this. I just want to apologise to all the BHS people who have been involved in this.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain will have to reach a new trade agreement with the European Union following its decision to sever links with Brussels. The task will be complex and will have to be carried out under the pressure of a two-year deadline. Here are some of the key issues. 1) Will a post-Brexit UK need a new trade deal with the European Union? Yes. Once the UK\u2019s formal decision to leave the EU is notified to the European council of EU leaders, under article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, the UK will be giving formal notice that it will be leaving the EU. Article 50 sets a two-year window to renegotiate a new legal basis for Britain\u2019s trade relationship with the EU - although it also allows for an extension. These discussions will need to consider the framework for exporting and importing goods (cars and food) and the basis for continued services trade (such as legal advice on big company takeovers) to and from the EU. In addition, negotiations will have to cover customs procedures, passport controls for business travellers and regulation on issues such as environmental, health and safety standards. 2) Will tariffs be imposed on UK goods and services under a new trade deal with the EU? This is entirely possible and up for discussion under a grand UK-EU deal. Currently, UK companies are able to trade with the EU on a tariff free and quota free basis. During negotiations for a new trade deal, there is nothing to stop Brussels seeking to impose a 5% tariff on all UK car exports (more than eight of 10 UK-made cars are sold abroad). The UK can, of course, threaten tit-for-tat tariffs on BMW or Fiat cars, but it means consumers on both sides of the Channel suffer. There is also the risk that the EU will impose quotas, which limit the amount of goods and services that can be sold into Europe. 3) Will the negotiations take place on a country-by-country basis? No. According to John Forrest, the head of international trade at law firm DLA Piper, the UK will simply be required to negotiate a single deal with the 27 remaining EU states under the EU\u2019s common commercial policy. \u201cIt will definitely not be on a country-by-country basis. The EU maintains a single harmonised customs border and the UK will simply negotiate with the EU the continued terms of trade with the EU,\u201d he says. 4) Does the British government and civil bureaucracy have the skills to negotiate an EU trade deal? According to Forrest, there is a high degree of expertise in the British government in terms of understanding which sectors need to be covered by a new agreement. \u201cThe UK government retains a high degree of expertise, backed up by input from UK companies and trade associations, with regard to the UK\u2019s priorities for any trade agreement.\u201d But, he adds, there might be an issue over securing the right number of skilled individuals required to pull off a wide range of bilateral and regional trade deals within a short time frame. \u201cThere may be a degree of concern over the level of negotiating resources. Undertaking a broad suite of regional and bilateral trade negotiations requires a significant number of qualified and experienced individuals.\u201d 5) What happens to Britain\u2019s financial services industry? Britain\u2019s financial and professional services industry \u2013 banks, accountants, corporate lawyers, investment managers is a significant contributor to GDP (around 12%, which is more than manufacturing). On Saturday, a senior figure at the European Central Bank said banks in the City of London risked being stripped of their lucrative EU \u201cpassports\u201d that allow them to sell services to the rest of the union. The City, as the industry is better known, will want to retain that passport; otherwise it will not, for instance, be able to advise on a mega-euro takeover in Germany or sell euro-denominated products such as derivatives. To do that simply, the City will need to join the single market, or the European Economic Area that encapsulates the EU and non-members such as Norway. That will, in turn, require accepting freedom of movement. Or the City can go it alone and operate in a much looser regulatory environment, which will please hedge funds and bankers keen to avoid an EU-imposed cap on bonus payments. 6) Will it affect trade with the US? No. The ability to trade with the US on current terms will not be affected. However, the UK will not be part of the controversial TTIP trade deal between the EU and US. 7) Who will be on the other side of the negotiating table to the UK? UK negotiators will need to engage via a number of bodies including the European council, individual European member states and the European commission (the EU\u2019s executive arm, which administers EU law). 8) Will the UK be able to pull off a trade deal in two years? This will be challenging, particularly if the option of joining the EEA is pursued but the British government balks at accepting freedom of movement as a quid pro quo. 9) What if no deal is reached within two years? According to Forrest, there are a number of potential scenarios, including that the current status quo prevails and the UK carries on trading with the EU under existing free movement principles. \u201cThat outcome is not beyond the realms of possibility,\u201d he says. However, that means freedom of movement for goods, people and capital between the UK and EU will continue to operate. For millions of people who campaigned and voted for leaving the EU, this is will be difficult to accept.",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England governor Mark Carney is expected to abandon plans to fly to Portugal for a summit of central bankers, amid fears of further turmoil when markets open on Monday. With expectations that the FTSE 100 index could open almost 3% lower on Monday, the governor was weighing up whether to stick to his plans to attend the European Central Bank\u2019s annual summit in Portugal on Wednesday. Carney, who was quick to make a public statement on Friday after the Brexit vote sent shock waves through financial markets, seems unlikely to carry on with his schedule to attend the last day of the three-day meeting in Portugal which starts on Monday. At one point on Friday morning as the result became clear, sterling dived to 30-year lows and the FTSE 100 was off almost 8%, although by the end of the week the stock market ended where it had started. Even so, an analyst at Dow Jones indices had calculated that the $2tn (\u00a31.4tn) wiped off global markets on Friday was the worse on record, surpassing the losses on 29 September 2008 during the height of the banking crisis. Carney was in Basel, Switzerland, for a meeting of central bank governors over the weekend, where he was expected to have discussed the implications of the historic vote on 23 June. The Bank, which declined to comment on the governor\u2019s travel plans, will on Tuesday offer the third and last of its emergency funding deals to offer cash to the banking system, which Carney had announced ahead of the 23 June referendum. The first two special loan facilities had a low uptake \u2013 \u00a32.4bn and \u00a3370m respectively. Carney will this week also chair a pre-scheduled meeting of the financial policy committee, set up in the wake of the banking crisis to weigh up the risks in the financial system. The meeting takes place at a time when volatility in the markets is high and anxiety about the future of the City is swirling. Across the British financial services industry, up to 100,000 financial jobs could be on the line, according to a report for the lobby group CityUK by PricewaterhouseCoopers ahead of the referendum. Banks are known to be making plans to move some jobs to EU areas if the City loses the \u201cpassporting\u201d arrangement that allows its banks, hedge funds and law firms to operate across Europe. HSBC would move 1,000 roles to France, while JP Morgan has said 4,000 jobs could be lost after Brexit. Rumours have swept through the City about how quickly any contingency plans would be implemented, with financial centres in Dublin, Paris, Frankfurt and Luxembourg all cited as potential beneficiaries. The chief executive of Deutsche Bank \u2013 which employs 11,000 in the City \u2013 has played down the long-term impact. John Cryan, who is British, told Handelsblatt: \u201cThe financial centre won\u2019t die but it will get weaker.\u201d The high street banks are also affected with their shares tumbling on Friday and the government abandoning any further efforts to cut its stakes in bailed out Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. Diane Coyle, professor of economics at Manchester University, said markets would be watching for signs that uncertainty was spilling over into the real economy. \u201cThere is the worry that uncertainty will feed through into decisions to hold off investment, higher prices of imported goods, falling house prices and the higher costs of a summer holiday abroad to stifle consumer spending. \u201cThese are things that can feed on themselves and cause a deeper recession.\u201d She added that an uncertain outcome to the Spanish elections on Sunday could trigger further volatility in financial markets.",

      "bodyText": "The age of globalisation began on the day the Berlin Wall came down. From that moment in 1989, the trends evident in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s accelerated: the free movement of capital, people and goods; trickle-down economics; a much diminished role for nation states; and a belief that market forces, now unleashed, were unstoppable. There has been push back against globalisation over the years. The violent protests seen in Seattle during the World Trade Organisation meeting in December 1999 were the first sign that not everyone saw the move towards untrammelled freedom in a positive light. One conclusion from the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington in September 2001 was that it was not only trade and financial markets that had gone global. The collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers seven years later put paid to the idea that the best thing governments could do when confronted with the power of global capital was to get out of the way and let the banks supervise themselves. Now we have Britain\u2019s rejection of the EU. This was more than a protest against the career opportunities that never knock and the affordable homes that never get built. It was a protest against the economic model that has been in place for the past three decades. To be sure, not all Britain\u2019s problems are the result of its EU membership. It is not theEuropean commission\u2019s fault that productivity is so weak or that the trains don\u2019t run on time. The deep-seated failings that were there when Britain voted in the referendum last Thursday were still there when the country woke up to the result on Friday. Evidence of just how unbalanced the economy is will be provided when the latest figures for Britain\u2019s current account are released later this week. These show whether the country\u2019s trade and investment income are in the black or the red. At the last count, in the final three months of 2015, the UK was running a record peacetime deficit of 7% of GDP. In another sense, however, the EU is culpable. In the shiny new world created when former communist countries were integrated into the global model, Europe was supposed to be big and powerful enough to protect its citizens against the worst excesses of the market. Nation states had previously been the guarantor of full employment and welfare. The controls they imposed on the free movement of capital and people ensured that trade unions could bargain for higher pay without the threat of work being off-shored, or cheaper labour being brought into the country. In the age of globalisation, the idea was that a more integrated Europe would collectively serve as the bulwark that nation states could no longer provide. Britain, France, Germany or Italy could not individually resist the power of trans-national capital, but the EU potentially could. The way forward was clear. Move on from a single market to a single currency, a single banking system, a single budget and eventually a single political entity. That dream is now over. As Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank put it: \u201cBrexit is a momentous event in the history of Europe and from now on the narrative will be one of disintegration not integration.\u201d The reason is obvious. Europe has failed to fulfil the historic role allocated to it. Jobs, living standards and welfare states were all better protected in the heyday of nation states in the 1950s and 1960s than they have been in the age of globalisation. Unemployment across the eurozone is more than 10%. Italy\u2019s economy is barely any bigger now than it was when the euro was created. Greece\u2019s economy has shrunk by almost a third. Austerity has eroded welfare provision. Labour market protections have been stripped away. Inevitably, there has been a backlash, manifested in the rise of populist parties on the left and right. An increasing number of voters believe there is not much on offer from the current system. They think globalisation has benefited a small privileged elite, but not them. They think it is unfair that they should pay the price for bankers\u2019 failings. They hanker after a return to the security that the nation state provided, even if that means curbs on the core freedoms that underpin globalisation, including the free movement of people. This has caused great difficulties for Europe\u2019s mainstream parties, but especially those of the centre left. They have been perfectly happy to countenance the idea of curbs on capital movements such as a financial transaction tax, and have no problems with imposing tariffs to prevent the dumping of Chinese steel. They feel uncomfortable, however, with the idea that there should be limits on the free movement of people. The risk is that if the mainstream parties don\u2019t respond to the demands of their traditional supporters, they will be replaced by populist parties who will. The French Socialist party has effectively lost most of its old blue-collar working class base to the hard left and the hard right, and in the UK there is a danger that the same thing will happen to the Labour party, where Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s laissez-faire approach to immigration is at odds with the views of many voters in the north that supported Ed Miliband in the 2015 general election, but who plumped for Brexit last week. There are those who argue that globalisation is now like the weather, something we can moan about but not alter. This is a false comparison. The global market economy was created by a set of political decisions in the past and it can be shaped by political decisions taken in the future. Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, analysed the voting patterns in the referendum and found that those parts of Britain with the strongest support for Brexit were those that had been poor for a long time. The result was affected by \u201cdeeply entrenched national geographical inequality\u201d, he said. There has been much lazy thinking in the past quarter of a century about globalisation. As Bell notes, it is time to rethink the assumption that a \u201cflexible globalised economy can generate prosperity that is widely shared\u201d. Self-evidently, large numbers of people across Europe do not believe a flexible, globalised economy is working for them. One response to the Brexit vote from the rest of Europe has been that a tough line should be taken with Britain to show other countries that dissent has consequences. This would only make matters worse. Voters have legitimate grievances about an economic system that has failed them. Punishing Britain will not safeguard the EU. It will hasten its dissolution.",

      "bodyText": "Alan Greenspan has seen more than a few dicey days on global markets in his time. So it was telling when the 90-year-old former chairman of the US Federal Reserve described the market chaos sparked by Britain\u2019s leave vote as \u201cthe worst period I recall\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it, including the crisis \u2013 remember 19 October 1987, when the Dow went down by a record amount of 23%? That I thought was the bottom of all potential problems. This has a corrosive effect that will not go away,\u201d Greenspan told the broadcaster CNBC. He is right. Brexit is about so much more than financial market turmoil. As Greenspan, who presided over the Federal Reserve for almost two decades, warned: \u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d A referendum many thought should never have been called in the first place has seen a narrow majority decide that the country should break away from the European Union at a time of great economic and political uncertainty. The worry for other EU leaders is that Britain\u2019s Leave vote will spark a domino effect throughout the rest of the continent, where forces of economic nationalism and anti-immigration politicians have already been gaining ground. For the eurozone\u2019s fragile economic recovery, this new phase of uncertainty could dash consumer spending, derail business deals and probably force the European Central Bank into yet more unconventional measures to get cash into the economy and shore up confidence. In Italy, alarm bells are already ringing that the economic consequences of Brexit could bring some of the country\u2019s vulnerable banks even closer to the brink of collapse. Milan\u2019s stock index suffered its biggest one-day drop in history after the UK result was announced. The shock waves could spread further still, says international thinktank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Its secretary-general, Angel Gurr\u00eda, warned of \u201cmajor consequences for the UK itself, the EU and the international community\u201d. In a febrile world, policymakers could be forgiven for not knowing which fire they will be putting out next. In China, relied on in recent times as the main engine of global growth, the pace of expansion has slowed and the economy is still struggling to rebalance. With or without Brexit, China\u2019s difficult transition was always seen as a global risk. Now the fear is that Britain\u2019s departure from the EU will intensify problems for the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, which has invested heavily in the UK in recent years. In Brazil, not so long ago seen as another potential draw for international investors, a credit crunch and the worst recession for eight decades has sparked a wave of bankruptcies. While trade links with the UK are small, the South American country\u2019s currency and stock market were under pressure on Friday on fears that Brexit could knock confidence in emerging economies \u2013 especially those like Brazil with hefty current account deficits. The world\u2019s biggest economy, the US, is not immune from any of this either. Markets are already jittery in advance of November\u2019s presidential election, which could potentially result in a change for America so momentous it would rival Brexit for headlines and global soul-searching. Indeed, the parallels were not lost on presidential candidate Donald Trump, who described the UK\u2019s referendum result as a \u201cgreat\u201d development. The risk that Brexit will worsen the global economic slowdown and cause an extended period of volatility on global markets adds a new uncertainty to the US outlook. With the horizon so clouded, markets have shifted to reflect radically reduced chances of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates again this year. As Greenspan says, the global economy is in \u201creal serious trouble\u201d. In such a world, Brexit brings additional challenges. The UK\u2019s historic decision to split from the European Union risks stoking those global fires and, just as importantly, risks exhausting the energies and capacities of policymakers at a time when they can least afford it. We hoped energy giants would be reformed. How naive we were Not just a good day but a brilliant day to bury bad news. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has spent the past two years studying the much-criticised energy markets and chose to publish its \u201cdo-nothing\u201d findings on Friday. It was a deeply suspect decision to pick the same date as the result of the UK\u2019s most serious constitutional question for 40 years, but then the move was fitting in many respects. The \u201cbig six\u201d suppliers have always believed the competition authorities had been dragged into a cynical exercise geared to take the political crisis of rising consumer bills off the government\u2019s hands and carry it safely into the long grass of regulation. Equally, consumer groups always feared the CMA was unlikely to crack down on profiteering by the big six, which can mobilise armies of advisers to run rings around regulators such as Ofgem and now the CMA, which has little understanding of the sector. So early expectations 24 months ago that excessive profits would be halted, vertical integration of wholesale and retail interests dismantled, and all domestic energy bills capped have been dashed. In their place the CMA has come up with 30 recommendations, none of which amount to more than tinkering around the edges: temporary price caps for those on prepayment meters and a database to make it easier for rival suppliers to approach existing customers, for example. Even one of its own senior panel members, Martin Cave, found the CMA\u2019s inaction unforgivable and insisted on having his objections noted. He wanted a price cap across the whole sector, given that his colleagues have admitted it is the 70% of loyal, often long-term, customers on standard variable tariffs that are overpaying most. Many of the new breed of independent suppliers expressed their horror at the missed opportunity to properly reform the market but the scale of the CMA\u2019s inaction has been partly obscured by falling commodity prices. Lower bills currently mean consumers are less affected by fuel poverty issues: but just wait till wholesale power costs rise and retail bills go with them. Then public anger will reappear and the CMA\u2019s failure will be laid bare. Tesco has made some good calls, but must play less golf Giraffe restaurants, Harris + Hoole coffee shops and Dobbies garden centres. These were the brands that former Tesco boss Philip Clarke believed could attract shoppers back into the company\u2019s supermarkets. They didn\u2019t, and now Clarke\u2019s replacement Dave Lewis has sold them off. With hindsight, messing around with coffee shops and restaurants showed how far off the mark Tesco was with customers under Clarke, who left in 2014. Tesco\u2019s real problem was that its products were too expensive and not of sufficient quality. The growth in Tesco\u2019s sales in the last two quarters shows that it is fixing this, but there is still a lot of work to do for Britain\u2019s biggest retailer. For example, the revelations that the boss of Tesco Bank spent more than \u00a318,000 on taxis in just eight months, and that Tesco had a \u00a310,000-a-year membership at Wentworth golf club in Surrey, show that the company still needs to make more cutbacks.",

      "body": "<p>Alan Greenspan has seen more than a few dicey days on global markets in his time. So it was telling when the 90-year-old former chairman of the US Federal Reserve described the market chaos sparked by Britain\u2019s leave vote as \u201cthe worst period I recall\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it, including the crisis \u2013 remember 19 October 1987, when the Dow went down by a record amount of 23%? That I thought was the bottom of all potential problems. This has a corrosive effect that will not go away,\u201d Greenspan told the broadcaster CNBC.</p> <p>He is right. Brexit is about so much more than financial market turmoil. As Greenspan, who presided over the Federal Reserve for almost two decades, warned: \u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d</p> <p>A referendum many thought should never have been called in the first place has seen a narrow majority decide that the country should break away from the European Union at a time of great economic and political uncertainty.</p> <p>The worry for other EU leaders is that Britain\u2019s Leave vote will spark a domino effect throughout the rest of the continent, where forces of economic nationalism and anti-immigration politicians have already been gaining ground. For the eurozone\u2019s fragile economic recovery, this new phase of uncertainty could dash consumer spending, derail business deals and probably force the European Central Bank into yet more unconventional measures to get cash into the economy and shore up confidence.</p> <p>In Italy, alarm bells are already ringing that the economic consequences of Brexit could bring some of the country\u2019s vulnerable banks even closer to the brink of collapse. Milan\u2019s stock index suffered its biggest one-day drop in history after the UK result was announced.</p> <p>The shock waves could spread further still, says international thinktank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Its secretary-general, Angel Gurr\u00eda, warned of \u201cmajor consequences for the UK itself, the EU and the international community\u201d.</p> <p>In a febrile world, policymakers could be forgiven for not knowing which fire they will be putting out next.</p> <p>In China, relied on in recent times as the main engine of global growth, the pace of expansion has slowed and the economy is still struggling to rebalance. With or without Brexit, China\u2019s difficult transition was always seen as a global risk. Now the fear is that Britain\u2019s departure from the EU will intensify problems for the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, which has invested heavily in the UK in recent years.</p> <p>In Brazil, not so long ago seen as another potential draw for international investors, a credit crunch and the worst recession for eight decades has sparked a wave of bankruptcies. While trade links with the UK are small, the South American country\u2019s currency and stock market were under pressure on Friday on fears that Brexit could knock confidence in emerging economies \u2013 especially those like Brazil with hefty current account deficits.</p> <p>The world\u2019s biggest economy, the US, is not immune from any of this either.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Here we are, and the question is: where do we go from here?\u201d Thus spoke one of David Cameron\u2019s (and my) political heroes, after a crisis that bore little comparison with the ordeal that our prime minister has recently put us all through. The speaker was Harold Macmillan, a true one nation Tory; Cameron claims to be one too, but he has often been sidetracked by the appalling, rightwing, Eurosceptical element in the party he has now given up trying to lead. When I say \u201cput us through\u201d, I refer not just to the near-half of the British electorate \u2013 of whom your correspondent was certainly one \u2013 who voted Remain. I refer also to large parts of the rest of Europe, and indeed the entire world, who could not understand why this wretched referendum had been called at all. We know the shallow, indeed base, rationalisation: he was worried about the electoral threat from Ukip, and made the mistake of thinking that, by conceding a referendum, he could also silence, or at least calm down, the vociferous anti-Europeans within the Conservative party itself. Some hopes! Lady Macbeth\u2019s eternal judgment was always going to threaten him: \u201cWe have scorched the snake, not killed it.\u201d And, if he had delved further back into our prized European cultural heritage, he would have recalled the ancient myth about the \u201csop to Cerberus\u201d: the warning that appeasement is never efficacious in such circumstances, because the monster always wants more to devour. Now, it has become pretty obvious to students of Cameron that he just makes it up as he goes along. But being a man of considerable intelligence and first-class education, he will no doubt have known of Clement Attlee\u2019s swift rebuff to Winston Churchill in 1945, when our wartime leader and prime minister suggested that there should be a referendum instead of a general election. Attlee dismissed this out of hand, pointing out that referendums had been the dubious, dictatorial resort of Hitler and Mussolini in the interwar years, and we should have none of it. Attlee then proceeded to win the 1945 general election by a landslide, founded the National Health Service, and set up the kind of welfare state \u201csafety net\u201d that had been missing in the interwar years \u2013 and which, with a few grumbles here and there, was accepted by the postwar Conservative party, and especially Macmillan, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. Macmillan succeeded Anthony Eden, who had himself waited so long to succeed Churchill that, when the latter finally retired in 1955, Eden lost the plot and indulged in the disastrous Suez venture of 1956. The Americans eventually pulled the rug from under him, by refusing to support the pound during the financial crisis brought on by the whole fiasco. The Suez expedition was one of the most egregious misjudgments made by a British prime minister since the 1939-45 war. Tony Blair\u2019s backing of George W Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq was another. And the calling of this referendum ranks pretty close in the hierarchy of monumental prime ministerial miscalculations. The only remotely convincing explanation I have heard for this failed gamble is that Cameron was expecting another coalition in which the Liberal Democrats would let him off the hook of calling a referendum. Well, he routed his potential coalition partners and has proceeded to unleash Jacquerie-style forces that are way beyond his or anyone else\u2019s control \u2013 but much welcomed by the likes of Donald Trump and Madame le Pen. One of my oldest friends, a one nation Tory like Macmillan (and like Cameron in his better moments), maintains that, even if one voted the other way, it has previously always been possible to see why the \u201cgood old British public\u201d voted the way it did in every election since 1945. But the good old British public has got it hopelessly wrong this time, and will pay dearly for allowing itself to be conned into thinking that the European Union, and immigration, are responsible for their undoubted unhappiness. The causes of their winter of discontent are manifold and it is true that successive governments have failed to address the housing crisis or respond adequately to pressures on public services. But there is a difference between responding adequately and actually taking the knife to essential public services and exacerbating the reasons for that discontent \u2013 the legacy of George Osborne\u2019s chancellorship. Did they really believe that money retrieved from the EU was going to be spent on the health service? Why, the egregious Farage was already resiling from that lying promise within hours of his unfortunate victory. Did they really believe that rightwing zealots such as Alexander \u201cBoris\u201d Johnson and Michael Gove were planning to reverse the austerity policies that have wreaked so much social damage? There is an old Chinese proverb: be careful what you wish for. The British \u2013 or rather, the English and Welsh \u2013 have now got it. Where do we go from here? I think, dear reader, that you have got my answer. But let me end with one last wish: that the Labour party finds itself a charismatic leader to take on these charlatans in the coming general election.",
