      "bodyText": "Unveiling Jane Austen on banknotes. Chillaxing at a music festival. Basking in the knowledge of being hand-picked as the first foreigner to govern the Bank of England. That was Mark Carney in July last year, when he arrived in London from Ottawa to take over on Threadneedle Street from the departing Mervyn King. Carney's headlines were to die for. He was the George Clooney lookalike with a mission to give the Old Lady a makeover. He was a cool dude, the guy who had been a goaltender in Harvard's ice hockey squad and now, in London, went jogging on Hampstead Heath. The US could boast Ben Bernanke, the student of the Great Depression, and the eurozone had Mario Draghi, the man who pledged do to whatever it takes to keep the single currency in business, but Britain had Mark Carney: the rock star central banker. Tuesday marks the anniversary of Carney's arrival at the Bank. So how is he shaping up, a year into the job? Here's how his report card looks. FIRST DAYS AT SCHOOL Early impressions were good. George Osborne badly wanted Carney to run the Bank of England. The economy had flatlined in 2011 and 2012 and the chancellor wanted to hire somebody who could rescue what looked like the equivalent of a failing school \u2013 and fast. Osborne said he wanted a governor to serve eight years: Carney was only prepared to do five. No problem, said Osborne. Carney said the financial package wasn't good enough. We'll improve it, said Osborne. Carney, an alumnus of Goldman Sachs, where they know plenty about dealmaking, made himself all the more attractive by playing hard to get. The reputation and the price tag did not seem to weigh on Carney's shoulders as he quickly settled in. He scored a PR triumph by turning up at Jane Austen's house in Hampshire to announce that the author of Pride and Prejudice would grace the back of a \u00a310 note \u2013 breaking the male dominance (the Queen excepted) on UK legal tender. In another well-received move, he appointed mandarin Sir Jon Cunliffe, one of Carney's old muckers at G7 summits, to be the Bank's deputy governor in charge of financial stability. HISTORY Carney's luck was in when he arrived. Despite Osborne's concerns, there were already signs of the economy's exam results improving in the last few months of King's stewardship. Fears of a triple-dip recession had been banished and the Office for National Statistics had even revised away the double-dip recession in 2011-12. For quarter after quarter, King had been forced to admit that the economy had performed less well than the Bank had been expecting, and that the recovery from the longest and deepest recession since the second world war had yet again been delayed. But finally, the measures he had taken \u2013 cutting interest rates to 0.5%, creating \u00a3375bn in new money through the quantitative easing programme, and the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) to encourage loans to homebuyers and small businesses \u2013 turned things around. It was the FLS, announced in the summer of 2012, that proved decisive: it reignited the housing market. By the time Carney took over, the economy was in the early stages of a vigorous, if belated, revival. His timing was perfect. ECONOMICS Carney could have sat back and let things take their course. For two reasons, though, he didn't do so. The first was the risk that a recovery still in its infancy might be snuffed out by the fear of rising borrowing costs. The second, less important, was that he was under pressure to justify his status (and \u00a3800,000-plus annual remuneration package). The big innovation arrived little more than a month after Carney's arrival in the form of \"forward guidance\". This was a pledge by the Bank that it had no immediate plans to raise interest rates and would only discuss doing so under certain conditions: if the unemployment rate fell below 7%; if there were a risk of an inflationary spiral; or if there were a raging house-price boom that could only be tackled by raising borrowing costs. The idea was to give consumers and businesses confidence that they could borrow free from anxiety about rate rises. The Bank said it expected unemployment \u2013 which then stood at 7.8% \u2013 to fall only slowly, with the 7% threshold reached in early 2016. The City took this to mean that official interest rates would remain on hold for the next two and a half years. MATHS Never the Bank's strongest subject, the failure to forecast correctly rapidly became a problem for Carney. Forward guidance worked even better than expected: growth was strong in the second half of 2013 and record numbers of jobs were created. By the end of the year it was clear the 7% threshold that was at the heart of forward guidance would be reached, not in early 2016, but in early 2014. As a result, forward guidance mark I lasted only six months. It was replaced in February by forward guidance mark II: the message from the Bank now was that it would look at a range of indicators to assess how much spare capacity there was in the economy, rather than focusing on the unemployment rate. The rebranding of forward guidance marked the end of Carney's six-month honeymoon. GENDER STUDIES There was a time when Threadneedle Street had the air of a boys' school. When Carney's appointment was announced in late 2012, there were no women on the nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) and all 11 members of the fledgling financial policy committee were men. Under Carney, the gender balance has improved. One of his early decisions was to appoint Charlotte Hogg as the Bank's chief operating officer, and over the next couple of months the number of women on the MPC will increase from nought to two: Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik, hired from the International Monetary Fund to be deputy governor in charge of markets and banking, and US economist Kristin Forbes, one of the four MPC members appointed from outside the Bank. MANAGEMENT STUDIES With the Bank now responsible for financial stability and policing banks in addition to setting interest rates, Carney called in two sets of management consultants, McKinsey and Deloitte, to help with the reorganisation of Threadneedle Street. The idea is to create a \"one Bank\" ethos rather than have a silo mentality. It is certainly a bigger bank: staff numbers have increased by 50% in the past year to almost 3,500 as its responsibilities have increased. MEDIA STUDIES In contrast to King, Carney has rarely been out of the media spotlight. Speeches are followed by on-the-record press conferences and big decisions are explained in TV interviews. The openness has extended to the written press, which rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 secured an audience with Carney's predecessors. Recently, the Bank's communication strategy has been a little confused. Carney's remarks at the May inflation report were taken to mean that interest rates were not going up during 2014. Just 29 days later his speech at the Mansion House suggested otherwise. Last week he was back to downplaying the chance of early action on rates. Carney insisted that he was being entirely consistent in his message, namely that the timing of higher borrowing costs depends on the data, and so markets should be prepared for a range of options, but the City has been left baffled. Chris Williams, chief executive of investment analysts Wealth Horizon, said: \"Despite its protestations, the Bank of England has significantly overestimated the level of clarity that the market and consumers have on its strategy around interest rates.\" The frequency of Carney's public pronouncements \u2013 and his tendency to speak in very long, convoluted sentences \u2013 has not helped. CAREER PROSPECTS Carney says he has achieved six things: \u25a0 Forcing the different parts of the Bank to talk to each other. \u25a0 Improving the way Threadneedle Street provides help to the markets. \u25a0 Insisting on stress tests for banks to ensure they can ride out problems. \u25a0 Chairing the international Financial Stability Board as it seeks a way of ensuring banks are not \"too big to fail\". \u25a0 Using forward guidance to delay interest rate increases that might have stalled the economic recovery. \u25a0 Using new macroprudential tools to calm down the housing market. Of these, finding an answer to \"too big to fail\" would have the biggest long-term impact. But it is the last two tasks \u2013 getting the timing of rate rises right and preventing a boom-bust in the housing market \u2013 that will be crucial to whether he is considered a success. If the governor can silence the doubters \u2013 of which there are a growing number \u2013 he can look forward to a big job in Canadian politics after 2018. If he gets it wrong, the rock-star banker will quickly lose his lustre. In the words of another of Canada's favourite sons, Leonard Cohen, he will be Last Year's Man.",

      "bodyText": "Contrary to the impression this column may sometimes give, I like to think that I am at heart an optimist. What makes one seem pessimistic are economic policies that appear to be mistaken and to cause unnecessary hardship. After all, although economics has been known for centuries as \"the dismal science\", it is fundamentally concerned with improving the human condition. I had thought that this was always the case \u2013 although some economists have made a big thing about \"the economics of happiness\", as if it were an exciting discovery. This is usually associated with criticism of the idea that gross domestic product is the be-all and end-all of economic performance. GDP is hardly a perfect measure, but it is as good as we have, and does tell you something. The official measurement traditionally excluded certain \"black economy\" activities, but now statisticians have dreamed up the idea of including the proceeds of the drug trade, as well as of the \"oldest profession\" in GDP figures. And, I assure you, these reports did not surface on April Fools' Day. Be that as it may, it is good to welcome a new book by Gerard Lyons which goes against the grain of current pessimism. In The Consolations of Economics, Lyons, now a veteran among City economic analysts, provides a most readable account of decades of economic policies and events, and his subtitle, How We Will All Benefit from the New World Order, is a welcome counterblast against the prevailing orthodoxy. Although Lyons is at present advising the mayor of London \u2013 whose name escapes me \u2013 he has worked for several international banks, and is as well-placed as anyone to comment on the lessons of national and international economic history. Two messages that stand out are that economic progress should not be feared as a \"zero-sum game\" \u2013 countries that have for years encouraged economic growth in developing nations should not feel threatened by competition; and, second, that international economic co-operation is vitally important. Lyons notes that globalisation has helped reduce inequality between countries, but is \"adding to inequality within countries, as highly skilled workers benefit from new markets, while low- and medium-skilled workers in the west compete with cheaper workers in emerging countries, or with immigrants at home\". He argues: \"The important thing is to ensure that this relative loss does not become an absolute loss. That puts the stress on ensuring healthy economic growth to generate jobs; on wages and taxes that yield sufficient take-home pay; and on welfare systems suitable for the 21st century.\" This is a very important debate. Globalisation has added millions, indeed billions, to the world's workforce. There is in economics a concept known as the \"factor price equalisation theorem\", which suggests the rewards for work in different places will tend to converge. There is widespread concern about stagnant, indeed falling, average real incomes in countries such as the UK. To some extent this is probably down to globalisation and factor price equalisation \u2013 to put it crudely: competition from cheap labour. But this does not mean policymakers should throw in the towel. When Angela Merkel complains that the European Union accounts for a small proportion of the world's population and GDP, but a huge proportion of social security spending, my reaction is that the rest of the world should aspire to European standards, not that we should join in a race to the bottom. And the \"healthy growth\" advocated by Lyons and others can help. Lyons rightly praises the much-maligned Gordon Brown because, \"when it came to two of the big calls of his time \u2013 not joining the euro and the London Summit \u2013 he got it right\". The G20 coordination in 2009, engineered by Brown, did indeed \"save the [financial and economic] world\". Lyons makes an implied dig at George Osborne: \"In the wake of the crisis too much debt was seen as the main challenge. In reality the combination of too much debt and too little economic growth was the problem.\" Far from being the necessary backdrop to the current UK recovery, Osborne's austerity programme was a catastrophic economic mistake, although so far our increasingly smug chancellor seems to have got away with it politically. As Lyons notes: \"Fiscal policy should not impose unnecessary strains on monetary policy.\" Monetary policy in this country is all over the place. Mark Carney, the chancellor's chosen Bank governor, is in danger of becoming a laughing stock. Forward guidance about the likely path of interest rates soon became forward misguidance. And now, with the governor changing his tune almost weekly, we have backward guidance. As the Bank struggles to find a way of controlling house prices without increasing interest rates and damaging the recovery, I am struck by a recent observation from my acquaintance Philipp Hildebrand, former governor of the Swiss Central Bank. His \"worst-case scenario\", as reported in the Financial Times, is that \"central banks could end up being accused of having failed twice \u2013 first by fuelling market distortions through loose monetary policy, and then by lacking the right tools to tackle them.\" Osborne's economic experiment is far from over.",

The shares are languishing and on Thursday, the day after Schneiderman spoke, Barclays's stock market value went down by \u00a32.4bn.
