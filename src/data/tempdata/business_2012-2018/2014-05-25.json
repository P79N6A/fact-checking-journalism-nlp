    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At first glance, it's hard to image how the powder in the vial which looks like black soot can live up to the promise of being an industrial game-changer. From bendable mobile phones to stronger condoms and tennis rackets and more efficient satellites, there is seemingly no end to the possibilities suggested for the material which was discovered 10 years and now has scientists scrambling to find uses for it. At the back of a complex of buildings in Cleveland, once the research and development facility of the former chemicals giant ICI, a small company of 20 people is well aware of the expectation that graphene carries. When Applied Graphene Materials (AGM), originally spun out of Durham University, made its stock market debut last November, the float was more than two times oversubscribed. Within a couple of days, the share price had tripled. Graphene, discovered by two physicists at the University of Manchester who later won the Nobel prize for their work, conducts electricity better than copper. It is also 200 times stronger than steel and six times lighter. In these early days when industry is still trying to ascertain what can be done with graphene, it has been suggested that sectors from consumer electronics to the medical industry and aviation can be overhauled by its properties. \"Ultimately our passion is to get graphene used in everyday products, because there is no reason why the shaver that I use in the morning shouldn't have graphene in it because it toughens the product or gives some sort of static electricity dissipation or whatever benefits might be needed,\" said Jon Mabbitt, AGM's chief executive. Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov isolated the material in 2004 when they removed carbon flakes from graphite using sticky tape. AGM was founded by the Durham professor Karl Coleman in 2010 after he found a way to produce graphene using carbon atoms sourced from ethanol. After securing \u00a31.6m in funding for the initial stages of the company, he was able to build a plant which can now produce a tonne of the material a year. AGM's graphene is used mainly as an additive in paints, coatings, oils, plastics, lubricants and resins in an attempt to work the material's strength and its heat and electrical conductivity into existing products. Typically, companies buy a sample and then work with AGM to trial it intheir product. A very small amount of the graphene is needed, between 0.5% and 2% of volume, to get the full benefit from what has been dubbed the \"wonder material\". Proctor &amp; Gamble and Dyson are two of the firms working with AGM to try to reap the benefits of graphene, such as stronger plastics. Mabbit describes AGM as an enabler, working with companies that are trying to come up with a vision of what to do with the new material. \"What we can do is put out some basic data to indicate what is possible and then whet people's imagination,\" he said. Compared with foldable mobile phones and batteries which charge in minutes, using graphene as an additive to paint and similar materials will not grab headlines but could reap enormous benefits, he said. By using graphene paint on a ship's hull, resistance to corrosion would be increased while its lubricating properties would mean barnacles and other sea life could not adhere to the vessel, which in turn would improve fuel efficiency. By adding graphene to engine oil, lubrication would be increased, allowing an engine to work harder. \"There have been too many extreme examples of its use so when we talk about adding into a paint, adding into a polymer, adding into an oil and lubricant, they sound fairly mundane,\" said Mabbitt. Some products have already put graphene to use, but it is still not known how long it will be before the material will become widely used. There is no price on it and there will not be until it is supplied to customers in meaningful quantities, said AGM chief finance officer, Oliver Lightowlers. \"I think there is a lack of understanding of where the most likely early uses of graphene are going to be \u2026 Some of the [consumer] electronic applications I believe personally will come, but they are going to take some time to come through to fruition,\" Mabbitt said. By 2020, he believes it will be added to materials, composites and lubricants and many structures, but without the fanfare which it currently attracts. Vincent Bouchiat of the Institut N\u00e9el in Grenoble described the beauty of graphene's simplicity. \"Graphene is a platform, like a chessboard, on to which one can place the pawns you want,\" he said. The EU has committed \u20ac1bn (\u00a3800m) over 10 years for research and development, and Asian companies keen to commercialise graphene have also invested heavily. The UK government's commitment of \u00a360m for a new graphene institute at Manchester University has been criticised as failing to properly grasp the potential that the material offers. The scale of that potential appears enormous. Mabbitt said that if graphene is needed by one of the paint manufacturers they work with - one of the top ten in the world \u2013 in just 1% of its paint, it would need 30 tonnes of the material a year. On those sample projections, it is not surprising that he calls research from a few years ago projecting the need for 400 tonnes of graphene by 2017 as \"probably understated\". What is graphene? Graphene is a layer of graphite one molecule thick. It is 100% pure carbon and is the thinnest material on earth. it has exceptional properties including the ability to conduct electricity 20 times better than copper. Its transparency has led it to be suggested for use on touchscreens, and it could also be integrated into aircraft paint to eliminate the impact of lightning on fuselages. New in tech Chip for your brain, sir? A breakthrough in wireless charging could unlock a new wave of sensors, computers and health tracking tools embedded deep inside our bodies \u2013 in our livers, hearts and even in our brains. The system could deliver power to tiny electronic devices like sensors, pacemakers and nerve stimulators embedded in the body using an external device the size of a credit card. The system has to be safety tested, but would enable much smaller implants for treating a range of diseases. \u2022 Google is making 3D-sensing tablets.

There is no price on it and there will not be until it is supplied to customers in meaningful quantities, said AGM chief finance officer, Oliver Lightowlers.</p> <p>\"I think there is a lack of understanding of where the most likely early uses of graphene are going to be \u2026 Some of the [consumer] electronic applications I believe personally will come, but they are going to take some time to come through to fruition,\" Mabbitt said.</p> <p>By 2020, he believes it will be added to materials, composites and lubricants and many structures, but without the fanfare which it currently attracts.</p> <p>Vincent Bouchiat of the Institut N\u00e9el in Grenoble described the beauty of graphene's simplicity. \"Graphene is a platform, like a chessboard, on to which one can place the pawns you want,\" he said.</p> <p>The EU has committed \u20ac1bn (\u00a3800m) over 10 years for research and development, and Asian companies keen to commercialise graphene have also invested heavily.</p> <p>The UK government's commitment of \u00a360m for a new graphene institute at Manchester University has been criticised as failing to properly grasp the potential that the material offers.</p> <p>The scale of that potential appears enormous. Mabbitt said that if graphene is needed by one of the paint manufacturers they work with - one of the top ten in the world \u2013 in just 1% of its paint, it would need 30 tonnes of the material a year. On those sample projections, it is not surprising that he calls research from a few years ago projecting the need for 400 tonnes of graphene by 2017 as \"probably understated\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-437759154\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/25/1401023012497/graphene-011.jpg\" alt=\"graphene\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The molecular structure of graphene.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK interest rates could start rising before next spring \u2013 but \"in baby steps\" \u2013 and are likely to settle at about 3% in a few years' time, the Bank of England's outgoing deputy governor has predicted. It will take three to five years for borrowing costs to rise to about 3%, Charles Bean said, but below the average of 5% seen in the decade before the financial crisis. The main UK interest rate has been held at 0.5%, a historic low, since March 2009, and the central bank's governor, Mark Carney, has indicated that rates will not rise until next year. Carney surprised the City when he played down calls for an early increase to rein in the booming housing market when the Bank released its quarterly inflation report this month. \"We should remember the economy has only just begun to head back to normal,\" he cautioned at the time. Financial markets have priced in a rate rise in March or April 2015, although a move seems more likely in an inflation report month \u2013 February or May \u2013 when the Bank can use its latest economic forecasts to explain the rationale for an increase. Bean, who is leaving the Bank at the end of June after 14 years, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend programme that raising borrowing costs \"a bit earlier\" than expected would enable the Bank to do it more gradually to minimise the economic pain. He said: \"There's a case for moving gradually because we won't be quite certain about the impact of tightening the bank rate given everything that has happened to the economy. \"It might not operate in quite the same way as it did before the crisis. So that's an argument if you like for being a little bit cautious, moving in baby steps to avoid making mistakes. If you want to pursue that strategy you need to start taking those baby steps a bit earlier, otherwise you end up being behind the curve.\" His view is shared by some other members on the monetary policy committee, who are arguing that raising rates sooner would lead to a gentler upward slope. Bean stressed there was no need to raise rates straight away, saying: \"One of the risks about moving too early is that you potentially forgo some [economic] activity that you might otherwise have had and one of the key issues for us will be whether we see some recovery in productivity which has been unusually subdued in recent years, and maybe if we nip the recovery too early then we won't see that productivity rebound.\" Interest rates were cut to a record low during the global financial crisis. Rising house prices in parts of the UK and other evidence that the economy is recovering strongly have fuelled a debate about when interest rates will go up. Bean said the lingering economic impact of the financial crisis would mean rates would stay lower than before the credit crunch, settling at about 3% in the next few years. Bean told the BBC: \"The Bank rate averaged about 5% in the decade or so before the crisis. It's reasonable to think that because of the headwinds that are still out there as well as some the global forces that perhaps the level that we go to three or five years out might be a couple of percentage points below that.\" He flagged up geopolitical risks to the economy including the Ukraine crisis, China's shadow banking system and the possibility of the US Federal Reserve returning to \"normal\" monetary policy earlier than expected. Asked about the UK housing market, Bean said authorities were more worried about rising household debt than house prices per se, and the Bank's financial policy committee could step in. \"Where the issues really start potentially being worrying is the accumulation of debt. So if there's signs that banks are making loans to borrowers who may not be able to repay or we have doubts about ... whether those households will be able to keep their consumption up if they borrow a lot, then they are reasons why the Bank's financial policy committee might want to take some action to rein things back a bit.\" A fellow former deputy governor Paul Tucker was criticised over the Libor rate-rigging scandal at Barclays and left the Bank last year after missing out on the top job, which went to Carney in July. The Bank was also drawn into the subsequent scandal over banks' manipulation of the foreign exchange markets. Bean said both were \"extremely serious charges\", echoing comments made by Carney in March. \"Any attempt to manipulate markets \u2013 whether it's the interbank market through manipulating Libor, the foreign exchange market through trying to manipulate the fix there \u2013 for private gain strikes at the integrity of markets. \"Markets can't function properly if people can't trust the actors involved as intermediaries to ensure they behave in an appropriate fashion.\" He added: \"It certainly speaks to the need to be continually vigilant \u2026 We need to be much more conscious of the scope for misbehaviour as well as complacent behaviour.\"",
