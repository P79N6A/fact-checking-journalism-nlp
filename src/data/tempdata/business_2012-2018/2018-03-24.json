      "bodyText": "There is little sadder than watching business groups and companies attempt to lobby in public by promising that they\u2019ll be good. This week the Business Council of Australia delivered a statement to the crossbench senators, signed by 10 CEOs of some of Australia\u2019s largest corporations, effectively begging them to pass the company tax cut legislation. But the statement only served to reinforce just how weak the impact of the company tax cuts will be on the lives of most workers. The statement pledged that \u201cif the Senate passes this important legislation we, as some of the nation\u2019s largest employers, commit to invest more in Australia which will lead to employing more Australians and therefore stronger wage growth as the tax cut takes effect\u201d. Presumably this means if the legislation is not passed they will not commit to investing more in Australia? It should be noted that while companies are crying out for a tax cut in order to employ more Australians, this week saw the government boasting of record level of employment growth. Similarly non-mining investment in the past year grew by 10% \u2013 the best result in four years and double the 30-year average annual growth of 5%. That this can be achieved under such a high company tax rate must surely rank as an economic miracle. Of course, none of the CEOs of the 10 companies (five of which paid no tax in 2015-16) outlined any actual investments they are holding off on making unless the company tax cut goes through. Indeed because the tax cut for companies with a turnover of more than $1bn a year is only set to occur in 2022-23, and will only fully be cut to 25% in 2026-27, any suggestion of investment decisions not occurring would be based not on the current company tax rate, but on what they anticipate it will be. That length of time also hurts the companies\u2019 and government\u2019s argument about \u201cstronger wage growth\u201d. There is absolutely no basis for arguing a tax cut will bring about stronger wage growth immediately. The government might hope you will believe that, but none of their reasoning for the cut suggests it will happen. A company tax cut theoretically leads to stronger wage growth because firstly such a cut is supposed to increase (mostly foreign) investment in equipment, machinery and infrastructure that in turn leads to an increase in productivity. Once that productivity increase occurs, then and only then wages growth will increase because the companies are producing more with the same amount of labour. They will thus seek to employ more and will not only raise wages to reward productivity improvements but also to entice workers to either stay or come work for them. But of course that end result is not only predicated on productivity improvements actually leading to increased employment (which is in no way a certain thing) but also that workers will be in a position to bargain for higher wages. And remember as well, even according to the government\u2019s own research the improved wages growth only is to occur \u201cin the long term\u201d. And just how large that theoretical wages rise would be is also up for debate. Treasury estimated a company tax cut would lead to a long-term ongoing real wage increase of 0.4%, but new research by ANU economist Chris Murphy, which takes into account the recent changes in the US company tax rate, suggests it would be just 0.29% if financed by bracket creep. Another new study by University of NSW Business School\u2019sprofessor of finance, Peter Swan, whose work in the 1980s for the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Financial System led to the Hawke government introducing the dividend imputation system, suggests the company tax cut won\u2019t even lead to increased foreign investment. He argues that \u201cinvestment in Australia is already at its globally efficient untaxed level\u201d as foreign investors are already able to take advantage of tax laws that allow them to sell shares before dividend payments are made and then buy them back afterwards. He argues this negates the impact of the tax cut and that \u201ceven if the Australian corporate tax rate is reduced from 30% to 25%, there should be no new foreign investment, but more Australians should invest offshore due to the lower tax impost\u201d. He concludes that \u201cconsequently, the tax cut plan is redundant with no billions of dollars\u2019 worth of desirable foreign investments left lying on the table\u201d. Senator Derryn Hinch was right to call the BCA\u2019s statement as \u201cvery kumbaya\u201d. There will be no way to prove any company has either increased investment or wages due to the tax cut, but there will be \u2013 as was the case in the US \u2013 lots of claims that this has occurred. But to believe companies will pay higher wages because of this tax cut requires a great deal of naivety. Which bring us to Senator Pauline Hanson who agreed to support the tax cut, despite having previously spoken out against it because, as she told the ABC, she was able to get funding for a \u201cpilot program\u201d for 1,000 apprentices in private business. The ALP quickly noted the government has cut apprenticeships by 140,000 places since 2013. The ALP is however being rather misleading about apprentice levels. A recent study by the Mitchell Institute found most of the drop in apprentices has actually been due to a drop in one-year \u201ctraineeships\u201d due to measures brought in by the Julia Gillard government to stop rorting by employers and training providers. But even if we only focus on the more traditional \u201ctrade\u201d industries, in 2017 there were 168,000 apprentices \u2013 down 41,000 from the 209,000 in 2013. That makes Senator Hanson\u2019s 1,000 apprentices program rather small beer, and must have had the government senators laughing at how cheaply she folded. One wonders if they even bothered to hide their laughter till they left the room.",

    "webTitle": "Unprotected GKN left to brave the cold corporate winds alone", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is a company that dates back to Britain\u2019s industrial revolution: an ironworks in south Wales that started in 1759 and supplied the tracks for Brunel\u2019s Great Western Railway. It has become, as GKN, a global engineering giant supplying car and aerospace parts, employing 60,000 around the world and 6,000 in the UK. But now corporate raiders loom in the form of a controversial \u00a37.8bn hostile bid \u2013 in which Theresa May\u2019s government has been sidelined, despite its aspiration to develop a new UK industrial strategy. Bidder Melrose has set a deadline of 1pm on Thursday for GKN shareholders to accept or reject its largely paper-based bid. Insiders describe the situation as finely balanced. Melrose, which is about the fifth of the size, says GKN has lost its way, repeatedly missing profit targets; it says its approach of buying underperforming businesses, restructuring them and selling them on in three to five years will generate far more value. As of Friday, just under 10% of GKN shareholders were backing the Melrose bid, broadly in line with the 9% support for the GKN board. GKN, which earned \u00a3658m last year on sales of \u00a39.7bn, says that Melrose has not offered enough with a bid worth approximately 457p against a GKN share price of 428p. GKN proposes its own restructuring, merging its West Midlands car parts business with US group Dana. GKN warns that jobs around the UK will be at risk, from its headquarters in Redditch through to its aerospace components operations in and around Bristol. Meanwhile, a string of politicians, from both the Conservative and Labour parties, as well as trade union Unite, accuse Melrose of operating a short-term model that will damage Britain\u2019s industrial base. They would like Greg Clark, the business secretary, to intervene. But few observers believe he has the legal power to do so. Len McCluskey, Unite\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cOur takeover law is simply inadequate when it comes to protecting British businesses. What happens in this country would not be allowed to happen in France, Holland or Germany.\u201d Melrose critics say the company has a poor record as a long-term owner of businesses, when it has been unable to sell them on. They point to Brush, a supplier of generators to the oil and gas industry based in Loughborough, which Melrose has owned since 2008. Last month Melrose said 270 UK jobs were at risk at a firm that employs 790 in the country. It said that Brush was the victim of an industry-wide downturn, but GKN supporters argue that a long-term investment strategy might have seen Brush invest in an attempt to diversify into the more promising area of renewables. \u201cLast year GKN spent \u00a3262m on R&amp;D; Melrose spent \u00a3223m over five years,\u201d said one source close to the company. Meanwhile Airbus, GKN\u2019s most important customer, has warned that it expects whoever wins the takeover battle to continue to invest in R&amp;D. Earlier this month, it warned against a short-term ownership approach. Tom Williams, the chief operating officer of Airbus\u2019s commercial aircraft division, said: \u201cIt would be practically impossible for us to give any new work to GKN under such an ownership model when we don\u2019t know who will be the long-term investor.\u201d Professor Chris Carr from Edinburgh University, who once worked at GKN, said: \u201cIf you look at this company, these industries operate on 50-year perspectives.\u201d Melrose is run by a group of executives, led by executive chairman Christopher Miller, who are among the best-paid public company bosses in the UK. Last year Miller and three other top executives shared in a bonus payout of \u00a3160m worth of shares, after a five-year incentive plan paid out. A previous plan matured in 2012, paying \u00a3126m in shares, largely to the same top executives. Earlier this month Simon Peckham, Melrose\u2019s chief executive, defended the pay of the company\u2019s bosses in front of MPs on the business committee: \u201cI appreciate that this is a difficult subject, but let me put the other side of the equation, which is that, other than to pay those tax levies we have just talked about, in the 15 years I have worked for Melrose, I have never sold a single share in it.\u201d A Unite official, Steve Turner, also giving evidence, said Melrose bosses had \u201ctrousered over \u00a3400m\u201d in the past decade, during which time GKN has invested \u00a3500m in UK manufacturing. Competition regulators can block or impose conditions on a merger, but Melrose has no meaningful overlap with GKN. Clark can only intervene in a takeover \u2013 and so force it to be considered by the Competition and Markets Authority \u2013 on grounds of national security, media plurality or financial stability. GKN has a modest defence parts business and its work is not critical to defending the nation. However, this has not stopped Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, from writing to Clark to raise concern because GKN supplies parts for F-35 fighters, A400M military transport planes and the Ajax armoured vehicles used by British armed forces. He is not the only Conservative to be concerned, demonstrating that the desire for a more assertive industrial policy has gone across the party divide. Rachel Maclean, Tory MP for Redditch, where GKN is headquartered, worries that 260 staff at the head office will lose their jobs if the takeover goes through, and while she would like Clark to intervene, she acknowledges that, under current law, \u201che only has a narrow remit\u201d. Citing Airbus, she said that \u201cthere are so many things pointing to a takeover not being a good idea\u201d and hoped that \u201cshareholders would think very carefully about the implications of their decision on the economy as a whole\u201d. The MP acknowledges that sentiment in her party is shifting, because \u201cas the economy becomes ever more globalised, policy and thinking has to evolve\u201d. In November May unveiled an industrial strategy white paper that she said would create \u201cthe conditions in which successful business can emerge\u201d and \u201cidentify the industries that are of strategic value\u201d. Its approach, however, was focused on investment and tax breaks in a range of key areas, including automotive, rather than takeover protection. Earlier this month Unilever decided to shift its HQ from London to Rotterdam, where Dutch law offers greater protections against takeovers. Unite highlights alternative options which would help protect companies like it and GKN. One is to give long-term investors extra voting rights to protect from short-term takeovers. Carr warns: \u201cYou do wonder what industrial companies we will be left with in a global world, post-Brexit.\u201d Troublesome takeovers Proposed takeovers of British industrial firms rarely pass without comment and a number of deals in recent years have faced concerted opposition. Here are some of the most contentious transactions. Kraft and Cadbury, 2010 Kraft, the US food giant, was ultimately successful in its \u00a312bn pursuit of Cadbury, one of the most venerable names in British industry. But the process was marked by stiff political and trade union opposition. The then business secretary, Lord Mandelson, warned Kraft against attempting to make a \u201cfast buck\u201d out of the Creme Egg maker, while unions warned that up to 30,000 jobs could be at risk. Kraft prevailed but immediately damaged its reputation by closing a Cadbury factory in Keynsham, near Bristol, despite indicating previously that it might keep the site open. Not only did 400 workers lose their jobs, but the example of Keynsham is still used by unions to warn about takeovers of British industrial firms. BAE Systems and EADS, 2012 The proposed \u20ac35bn (\u00a331bn) merger of Britain\u2019s biggest defence manufacturer and the Franco-German owner of Airbus foundered in the face of political, union and media opposition. The British, German and French governments could not reach agreement on the corporate structure of the business, which would have combined two of the most politically sensitive companies in Europe. Angela Merkel, in particular, harboured the deepest concerns about the deal, for which she saw no strategic logic. Chastened by the experience, neither business has pursued a transformative deal since. Pfizer and AstraZeneca, 2014 When US drugs giant Pfizer attempted to buy the Anglo-Swedish drugs maker for \u00a369bn, it was attacked on both sides of the Atlantic for admitting that tax savings were a key factor in its bid. David Cameron, then the PM, said he was neutral about the bid, but MPs and trade unions raised concerns over the offer, suspecting that Pfizer would strip out R&amp;D jobs. However, AstraZeneca was also adamant that Pfizer\u2019s approach \u2013 at \u00a355 a share \u2013 undervalued the company and Pfizer walked away. AstraZeneca is trading at around \u00a348 currently. Kraft Heinz and Unilever, 2017 Heinz\u2019s \u00a3115bn approach for Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group behind Marmite and Magnum ice-cream, fell apart rapidly in the wake of strong opposition from the bid target. Kraft Heinz, the US maker of Philadelphia cream cheese, abandoned its interest after Unilever, which employs 7,000 people in the UK, made clear it had no interest in a deal. Political and trade union disquiet over the proposed transaction had barely started to be heard. But Unilever\u2019s determination to protect itself more adequately against further overtures led to it choosing Rotterdam over London as its main HQ this year.",

But few observers believe he has the legal power to do so. Len McCluskey, Unite\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cOur takeover law is simply inadequate when it comes to protecting British businesses. What happens in this country would not be allowed to happen in France, Holland or Germany.\u201d</p> \n<p>Melrose critics say the company has a poor record as a long-term owner of businesses, when it has been unable to sell them on. They point to <a href=\"http://www.brush.eu/\">Brush</a>, a supplier of generators to the oil and gas industry based in Loughborough, which Melrose has owned since 2008. Last month Melrose said 270 UK jobs were at risk at a firm that employs 790 in the country. It said that Brush was the victim of an industry-wide downturn, but GKN supporters argue that a long-term investment strategy might have seen Brush invest in an attempt to diversify into the more promising area of renewables. \u201cLast year GKN spent \u00a3262m on R&amp;D; Melrose spent \u00a3223m over five years,\u201d said one source close to the company.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Airbus, GKN\u2019s most important customer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/15/airbus-warns-melrose-gkn-takeover\">has warned</a> that it expects whoever wins the takeover battle to continue to invest in R&amp;D. Earlier this month, it warned against a short-term ownership approach. Tom Williams, the chief operating officer of Airbus\u2019s commercial aircraft division, said: \u201cIt would be practically impossible for us to give any new work to GKN under such an ownership model when we don\u2019t know who will be the long-term investor.\u201d</p> \n<p>Professor Chris Carr from Edinburgh University, who once worked at GKN, said: \u201cIf you look at this company, these industries operate on 50-year perspectives.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"18dfc61e-83b7-42d2-a310-205549f08e0c\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>GKN is a global engineering business based in Redditch, Worcestershire.

Last year Miller and three other top executives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/31/four-melrose-directors-to-share-bonus-pot-of-160m\">shared in a bonus payout of \u00a3160m worth of shares, </a>after a five-year incentive plan paid out. A previous plan matured in 2012, paying \u00a3126m in shares, largely to the same top executives.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month Simon Peckham, Melrose\u2019s chief executive, defended the pay of the company\u2019s bosses in front of MPs on the business committee: \u201cI appreciate that this is a difficult subject, but let me put the other side of the equation, which is that, other than to pay those tax levies we have just talked about, in the 15 years I have worked for Melrose, I have never sold a single share in it.\u201d A Unite official, Steve Turner, also giving evidence, said Melrose bosses had \u201ctrousered over \u00a3400m\u201d in the past decade, during which time GKN has invested \u00a3500m in UK manufacturing.</p> \n<p>Competition regulators can block or impose conditions on a merger, but Melrose has no meaningful overlap with GKN. Clark can only intervene in a takeover \u2013 and so force it to be considered by the Competition and Markets Authority \u2013 on grounds of national security, media plurality or financial stability. GKN has a modest defence parts business and its work is not critical to defending the nation. However, this has not stopped Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, from writing to Clark to raise concern because GKN supplies parts for F-35 fighters, A400M military transport planes and the Ajax armoured vehicles used by British armed forces.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef9f641e4c0d5d4ee572d5fccf2ea40763eef7d4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef9f641e4c0d5d4ee572d5fccf2ea40763eef7d4/0_211_2182_1308/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Business secretary Greg Clark walking near Downing Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many want business secretary Greg Clark to intervene in Melrose/GKN deal but fear he lacks legal powers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He is not the only Conservative to be concerned, demonstrating that the desire for a more assertive industrial policy has gone across the party divide. Rachel Maclean, Tory MP for Redditch, where GKN is headquartered, worries that 260 staff at the head office will lose their jobs if the takeover goes through, and while she would like Clark to intervene, she acknowledges that, under current law, \u201che only has a narrow remit\u201d. Citing Airbus, she said that \u201cthere are so many things pointing to a takeover not being a good idea\u201d and hoped that \u201cshareholders would think very carefully about the implications of their decision on the economy as a whole\u201d. The MP acknowledges that sentiment in her party is shifting, because \u201cas the economy becomes ever more globalised, policy and thinking has to evolve\u201d.</p> \n<p>In November May unveiled an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/27/clark-details-industrial-strategy-productivity-business-watchdog-white-paper\">industrial strategy white paper</a> that she said would create \u201cthe conditions in which successful business can emerge\u201d and \u201cidentify the industries that are of strategic value\u201d. Its approach, however, was focused on investment and tax breaks in a range of key areas, including automotive, rather than takeover protection.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month Unilever decided to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/15/unilever-brexit-rotterdam-hq-london\">shift its HQ from London to Rotterdam</a>, where Dutch law offers greater protections against takeovers.

Here are some of the most contentious transactions.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Kraft and Cadbury, 2010</strong><br>Kraft, the US food giant, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/19/cadbury-board-agrees-kraft-sale\">ultimately successful in its \u00a312bn pursuit of Cadbury</a>, one of the most venerable names in British industry. But the process was marked by stiff political and trade union opposition. The then business secretary, Lord Mandelson, warned Kraft against attempting to make a \u201cfast buck\u201d out of the Creme Egg maker, while unions warned that up to 30,000 jobs could be at risk. Kraft prevailed but immediately damaged its reputation by closing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/08/kraft-cadbury-closure-takeover-panel\">Cadbury factory in Keynsham, near Bristol</a>, despite indicating previously that it might keep the site open. Not only did 400 workers lose their jobs, but the example of Keynsham is still used by unions to warn about takeovers of British industrial firms.</p> \n<p><strong>BAE Systems and EADS, 2012</strong><br>The proposed \u20ac35bn (\u00a331bn) merger of Britain\u2019s biggest defence manufacturer and the Franco-German owner of Airbus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/10/bae-eads-merger-off-political-concerns\">foundered in the face of political, union and media opposition</a>. The British, German and French governments could not reach agreement on the corporate structure of the business, which would have combined two of the most politically sensitive companies in Europe. Angela Merkel, in particular, harboured the deepest concerns about the deal, for which she saw no strategic logic. Chastened by the experience, neither business has pursued a transformative deal since.</p> \n<p><strong>Pfizer and AstraZeneca, 2014</strong><br>When US drugs giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/19/astrazeneca-board-reject-pfizer-takeover-bid\">Pfizer attempted to buy the Anglo-Swedish drugs maker for \u00a369bn</a>, it was attacked on both sides of the Atlantic for admitting that tax savings were a key factor in its bid. David Cameron, then the PM, said he was neutral about the bid, but MPs and trade unions raised concerns over the offer, suspecting that Pfizer would strip out R&amp;D jobs. However, AstraZeneca was also adamant that Pfizer\u2019s approach \u2013 at \u00a355 a share \u2013 undervalued the company and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/26/pfizer-abandons-attempt-astrazeneca-pharmaceutical\">Pfizer walked away</a>. AstraZeneca is trading at around \u00a348 currently.</p> \n<p><strong>Kraft Heinz and Unilever, 2017</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/20/how-unilever-foiled-kraft-heinzs-115m-takeover-bid-warren-buffett\">Heinz\u2019s \u00a3115bn approach for Unilever</a>, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group behind Marmite and Magnum ice-cream, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/19/kraft-heinz-unilever-shareholders-lobbies-uk-government-takeoverbid\">fell apart rapidly</a> in the wake of strong opposition from the bid target. Kraft Heinz, the US maker of Philadelphia cream cheese, abandoned its interest after Unilever, which employs 7,000 people in the UK, made clear it had no interest in a deal. Political and trade union disquiet over the proposed transaction had barely started to be heard. But Unilever\u2019s determination to protect itself more adequately against further overtures led to it choosing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/15/unilever-brexit-rotterdam-hq-london\">Rotterdam over London as its main HQ this year</a>.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Life may have just got more exciting for the bosses of Barclays \u2013 and not in a good way. Last week the bank revealed that Edward Bramson \u2013 a US-based investor who admits that some people would describe him as \u201cpond scum\u201d \u2013 had notched up a 5.2% shareholding, making him Barclays\u2019 fourth-biggest investor. The disclosure was required once Bramson passed the 5% mark. Bramson is not just any shareholder. He is an example of the aggressive activist investors that are buying stakes in UK companies with the aim of shaking things up and extracting returns. Barclays welcomed Bramson to its shareholder list but the greeting was no doubt made through gritted teeth. Bramson\u2019s record of dogged agitation suggests Barclays\u2019 bosses could now be in for a hard time. Bramson has bought stakes in a series of British companies in the past 15 years and has reaped returns averaging 22.8% a year. He typically does so by buying a sizeable stake, demanding a seat on the board and then pushing for cost cuts, payouts to shareholders and other changes that boost returns. Bramson is based in New York, where he operates from an office on the 32nd floor of a midtown Manhattan block looking out at the Chrysler Building and the East river. But though his style is transatlantic, Bramson was born and grew up in England. His mother was British and his father American. He moved to New York in 1975, aged 24, to get away from Britain when it was in the doldrums and run by a Labour government he saw as \u201cdirigiste\u201d. Bramson got into private equity and started his own firm in 1977. Things have not always gone his way: in 1987 he lost $60m after buying Ampex, a US maker of recording equipment. More recently, Sherborne\u2019s stake in fitness equipment firm Nautilus also lost money. In 2003 he abandoned private equity for activism and launched Sherborne Investors, whose first investment was 4imprint, a promotions company. Sherborne describes itself as a \u201cturnaround investment firm\u201d. Other more blunt descriptions for activist investors like Bramson include \u201ccorporate raider\u201d and \u201casset stripper\u201d. In a rare interview in 2015, Bramson said he had been called \u201cpond scum\u201d but that big investors in his fund, including Aviva and BlackRock, saw things differently. \u201cAll those people know what we do. It is not a secret. They are the largest investing institutions in the UK or in the world. They don\u2019t think it\u2019s anathema,\u201d he told Bloomberg Markets magazine. If a company resists, he enlists the support of other large shareholders that are sometimes investors in Sherborne, which supply it with money and agree to the fund taking up to 25% of the gains. Bramson raised \u00a3700m in July for his next investment. It was Sherborne\u2019s biggest fundraising yet, suggesting he had something significant in mind. The prospectus said Sherborne would find an undervalued company with \u201coperational deficiencies\u201d and that its investment would not be passive. Barclays has, therefore, been warned. Its chief executive, Jes Staley, has already sold Barclays\u2019 African business, got out of European retail banking and set the bank up to cut branches as customers go online. But investors have not been impressed: its market value languishes well below its assets and the valuations of other European banks. The shares, 250p three years ago, are currently changing hands at 203p. The most likely target for Bramson\u2019s shake-up is Barclays\u2019 investment bank, whose status has swung from prized possession to expensive underperformer. What he has in mind remains to be seen. Bramson contacted Barclays after the bank\u2019s annual results on 22 February to let the bank know he was building a stake. He and his partner at Sherborne, Stephen Welker, met Barclays\u2019 head of investor relations but there is no meeting planned as yet with Staley. Bramson\u2019s style is to sit tight and work out his demands. Unlike other US activists such as Carl Icahn or Eric Knight, who agitated at HSBC a decade ago, Bramson does not use the media to conduct a campaign against the company\u2019s management. He may be publicity-shy but that does not stop him from being highly aggressive. At fund management group F&amp;C he built a 20% stake, ousted the chairman in 2011 and spent more than two years pushing for cost cuts and a revamped investment strategy. At Electra, Bramson bought a 30% stake in 2013 and worked for almost two years to install himself and another director chosen by him on the board. He installed himself as the stand-in chief executive, standing down in December 2017. But Barclays \u2013 currently valued at \u00a334bn \u2013 will be a more difficult nut to crack than Bramson\u2019s other investments. A 5% shareholding gives him far less influence than he had at F&amp;C or Electra, whose smaller size let him buy big stakes. Sherborne has not previously invested in banks, which are strictly regulated. The Bank of England is unlikely to want him calling the shots at Barclays, which is regarded as systemically important to the financial system. But Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at stockbroker Jefferies, said that after placing such a big bet on Barclays, Bramson would not sit back. \u201cSherborne\u2019s managing directors have at best limited experience in banks investing,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cInvestors should take note that, however out of character, [Sherborne\u2019s] investment in Barclays consumes nearly all of its capital and so is clearly a massive active bet.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Life may have just got more exciting for the bosses of Barclays \u2013 and not in a good way. Last week the bank revealed that Edward Bramson \u2013 a US-based investor who admits that some people would describe him as \u201cpond scum\u201d \u2013 had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/19/barclays-wakes-up-to-find-a-bull-called-bramson-in-the-shop\" title=\"\">notched up a 5.2% shareholding</a>, making him Barclays\u2019 fourth-biggest investor. The disclosure was required once Bramson passed the 5% mark.</p> <p>Bramson is not just any shareholder. He is an example of the aggressive activist investors that are buying stakes in UK companies with the aim of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/nov/05/electra-election-flimsy-platform-private-equity\" title=\"\">shaking things up and extracting returns</a>. Barclays welcomed Bramson to its shareholder list but the greeting was no doubt made through gritted teeth. Bramson\u2019s record of dogged agitation suggests Barclays\u2019 bosses could now be in for a hard time.</p> <p>Bramson has bought stakes in a series of British companies in the past 15 years and has reaped returns averaging 22.8% a year. He typically does so by buying a sizeable stake, demanding a seat on the board and then pushing for cost cuts, payouts to shareholders and other changes that boost returns.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/19/barclays-wakes-up-to-find-a-bull-called-bramson-in-the-shop\">Barclays wakes up to find a bull called Bramson in the shop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bramson is based in New York, where he operates from an office on the 32nd floor of a midtown Manhattan block looking out at the Chrysler Building and the East river. But though his style is transatlantic, Bramson was born and grew up in England. His mother was British and his father American.</p> <p>He moved to New York in 1975, aged 24, to get away from Britain when it was in the doldrums and run by a Labour government he saw as \u201cdirigiste\u201d. Bramson got into private equity and started his own firm in 1977. Things have not always gone his way: in 1987 he lost $60m after buying Ampex, a US maker of recording equipment. More recently, Sherborne\u2019s stake in fitness equipment firm Nautilus also lost money.</p> <p>In 2003 he abandoned private equity for activism and launched Sherborne Investors, whose first investment was 4imprint, a promotions company. Sherborne describes itself as a \u201cturnaround investment firm\u201d. Other more blunt descriptions for activist investors like Bramson include \u201ccorporate raider\u201d and \u201casset&#xa0;stripper\u201d.</p> <p>In a rare interview in 2015, Bramson said he had been called \u201cpond scum\u201d but that big investors in his fund, including Aviva and BlackRock, saw things differently. \u201cAll those people know what we do. It is not a secret. They are the largest investing institutions in the UK or in the world. They don\u2019t think it\u2019s anathema,\u201d he told <em>Bloomberg Markets</em> magazine.</p> <p>If a company resists, he enlists the support of other large shareholders that are sometimes investors in Sherborne, which supply it with money and agree to the fund taking up to 25% of the gains. Bramson raised \u00a3700m in July for his next investment. It was Sherborne\u2019s biggest fundraising yet, suggesting he had something significant in mind. The prospectus said Sherborne would find an undervalued company with \u201coperational deficiencies\u201d and that its investment would not be passive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91aab049a9e231f37981e0cf5ec39e5cb724bb7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91aab049a9e231f37981e0cf5ec39e5cb724bb7b/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Bramson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bramson\u2019s style is to sit tight while he works out his demands.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barclays has, therefore, been warned. Its chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/barclays-appoints-jes-staley-new-chief-executive\" title=\"\">Jes Staley</a>, has already sold Barclays\u2019 African business, got out of European retail banking and set the bank up to cut branches as customers go online. But investors have not been impressed: its market value languishes well below its assets and the valuations of other European banks. The shares, 250p three years ago, are currently changing hands at 203p.</p> <p>The most likely target for Bramson\u2019s shake-up is Barclays\u2019 investment bank, whose status has swung from prized possession to expensive underperformer. What he has in mind remains to be seen. Bramson contacted Barclays after the bank\u2019s annual results on 22&#xa0;February to let the bank know he was building a stake. He and his partner at Sherborne, Stephen Welker, met Barclays\u2019 head of investor relations but there is no meeting planned as yet with Staley.</p> <p>Bramson\u2019s style is to sit tight and work out his demands. Unlike other US activists such as Carl Icahn or Eric Knight, who agitated at HSBC a decade ago, Bramson does not use the media to conduct a campaign against the company\u2019s management.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/19/activist-investor-plans-shake-up-at-barclays-after-building-5-share\">Activist investor plans shake-up at Barclays after building 5% share</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He may be publicity-shy but that does not stop him from being highly aggressive. At fund management group F&amp;C he built a 20% stake, ousted the chairman in 2011 and spent more than two years pushing for cost cuts and a revamped investment strategy.</p> <p>At Electra, Bramson bought a 30% stake in 2013 and worked for almost two years to install himself and another director chosen by him on the board. He installed himself as the stand-in chief executive, standing down in December 2017.</p> <p>But Barclays \u2013 currently valued at \u00a334bn \u2013 will be a more difficult nut to crack than Bramson\u2019s other investments. A 5% shareholding gives him far less influence than he had at F&amp;C or Electra, whose smaller size let him buy big stakes.</p> <p>Sherborne has not previously invested in banks, which are strictly regulated. The Bank of England is unlikely to want him calling the shots at Barclays, which is regarded as systemically important to the financial system.</p> <p>But Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at stockbroker Jefferies, said that after placing such a big bet on Barclays, Bramson would not sit back. \u201cSherborne\u2019s managing directors have at best limited experience in banks investing,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cInvestors should take note that, however out of character, [Sherborne\u2019s] investment in Barclays consumes nearly all of its capital and so is clearly a massive active bet.\u201d</p>",
