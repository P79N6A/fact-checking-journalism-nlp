      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover has unveiled plans to recruit 5,000 new engineers over the next year in a boost for British industry as the Brexit talks begin. The carmaker has just enjoyed a record year of sales bolstered by demand for luxury cars in China and North America, and needs thousands of new recruits, predominantly in the UK, to help develop new models, including electric cars. JLR is the country\u2019s biggest car manufacturer and has been held up by ministers as a poster child for British industry. It is also one of the UK\u2019s largest exporters, with about 80% of its \u00a324bn annual revenues generated from cars sold abroad. Its expansion plans will bolster hopes that the UK\u2019s export sector can help offset some of the domestic pressures on the economy in the years ahead as household budgets continue to be squeezed by weak pay growth and rising inflation on the back of the slide in sterling triggered by Brexit. The pound\u2019s weakness since the referendum has made imports to the UK more expensive, but it has also been a boon to some exporters because it makes their goods more competitive in overseas markets. The exchange-rate effect has also flattered the earnings of those companies with big overseas earnings. JLR, owned by India\u2019s Tata group, said that more than 1,000 of the new 5,000 engineering recruits would be electronic and software engineers. Faced with chronic skills shortages in the sector, the carmaker believes it has come up with an innovative way to reach candidates from a wider pool, and is working with Gorillaz to recruit people via the virtual band\u2019s app. Potential candidates will be set challenges via the app, including assembling the Jaguar I-PACE Concept, Jaguar\u2019s first all-electric five-seater sports car. There will also be code-breaking challenges to test applicants\u2019 \u201ccuriosity, persistence, lateral thinking and problem solving skills\u201d. JLR said: \u201cThe best performers will be fast-tracked through the recruitment process, helping to meet Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s ambition to employ thousands of bright new talents over the next year. It\u2019s a major change in the way the business looks for candidates, aiming to tackle the engineering skills gap, inspire and attract a diverse range of talent and new thinking.\u201d The company said it would also accept applications via traditional routes such as the JLR careers website. JLR\u2019s main UK manufacturing and engineering sites are in Solihull and Castle Bromwich in Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Gaydon, Coventry and Halewood in Liverpool. The wider UK car industry had a record year in 2016, with annual sales of new vehicles at just under \u00a32.7m. Demand has partly been driven by consumers capitalising on cheap finance deals and those seeking more fuel-efficient vehicles. But industry leaders have voiced fears about the outlook for UK carmakers if Britain leaves the EU. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned in November that car manufacturing was at risk of \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d if companies chose to invest in other countries.",

Brussels will publish proposals this Wednesday to force financial intermediaries to automatically disclose any new cross-border tax schemes offered to clients. Those designing and promoting aggressive avoidance structures will have five working days to file details with their local tax authority, according to a leaked version of the proposals, drawn up by the European commission. The clock will begin ticking as soon as the scheme has become available to a client. Where there are several intermediaries in the chain, one will be made to take responsibility for disclosure. And where all intermediaries in the chain are based outside European member states, the obligation to disclose will fall to the client. \u201cThe ultimate objective\u201d, according to the commission, \u201cis to design a mechanism \u2026 that will dissuade intermediaries from designing and marketing such arrangements.\u201d The new rules will come into force in 2019 and are aimed at cross-border schemes that involve more than one country, so long as one of the jurisdictions involved is within Europe. Since 2004, UK statute books have had legislation forcing those who market tax schemes to report them to Revenue &amp; Customs. Portugal and Ireland have similar rules. However, the commission\u2019s proposals would further tighten the screw on British-based intermediaries. This is because all European member states will be obliged to share with each other, every three months, details of the tax schemes disclosed. A central directory of avoidance schemes will be created, to which all member states will have access. It is possible the regulations will never be adopted by the UK. However, if Britain negotiates to remain part of the single market, it would be subject to the same tax and financial regulation as full members of the union. Research shows that globally, the majority of intermediaries are based in Hong Kong, the UK and the United States. A study of the ICIJ Offshore Leaks database, which contains data from the Panama Papers and previous leaks, identified 140 intermediaries linked to offshore entities. Nearly 90% of them have an office, a subsidiary or an affiliate in Europe. The most active facilitators were the Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse, which were linked to 24,500 offshore entities between them, according to the report, which was commissioned by the Green and European Free Alliance groups in the European parliament. Trident Corporate Services, which has offices in London\u2019s Portland Place and was linked to 8,500 offshore entities, is the third largest and the first in a string of middlemen whose names are largely unknown outside the world of offshore companies. \u201cIf we go for a softer Brexit, as now seems more likely, these rules would apply in the UK,\u201d said a Green MEP for south-west England and Gibraltar, Molly Scott Cato. \u201cWe call on member states to adopt the proposal as soon as possible and to scale up resources in their tax administrations.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Barclays and a number of its former executives are expected to learn this week whether the Serious Fraud Office intends to bring criminal charges in relation to emergency fundraising at the height of the financial crisis. The five-year SFO investigation has focused on the events surrounding cash injections from an arm of Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. Speculation is growing that the SFO will press ahead with charges, and there have been reports that an announcement could come as soon as Tuesday. Decisions have been delayed on a number of occasions. The deadline was initially the end of March,, then the end of May and then the end of June. The SFO has confirmed that the latest timetable is on track. The investigation was announced in August 2012. The stakes are high, not only for the individuals involved and the bank itself, which has been trying to restore its reputation after a series of scandals, but also for the SFO and its head, David Green. The Conservatives\u2019 election manifesto pledged to fold the SFO into the National Crime Agency. No bankers have faced criminal charges in the UK for events that took place during the financial crisis, and UK authorities have not pursued criminal charges against a high street bank. The SFO has provided little detail about its investigation, but Barclays has been required to make disclosures in its formal stock exchanges announcements. These show that the focus has been on \u201cadvisory services agreements\u201d between Barclays and Qatar Holding, an investment vehicle for the Gulf state, which bought shares in the bank during two fundraisings at the height of the financial crisis. In 2008 Barclays raised \u00a34.5bn in June then a further \u00a37.3bn in October from a number of investors including Qatar Holding. In documents accompanying the June fundraising, Barclays disclosed the arrangement with Qatar but did not put a value on the deal. The bank did not disclose the arrangement in the October documentation. Barclays has since said the fees amounted to \u00a3332m payable over five years. In September 2013 Barclays revealed that the Financial Conduct Authority intended to fine the bank \u00a350m for reckless behaviour by breaching disclosure rules. The bank contests the findings, and these regulatory proceedings have been stayed while the criminal investigation continues. When Barclays first announced it was being investigated by the City regulator in 2012, it disclosed that Chris Lucas, then its finance director, was one of \u201cfour current and former senior employees\u201d being investigated. Lucas left on health grounds in 2013. It has been reported that during its pursuit of the case the SFO has questioned 44 individuals, including John Varley, the former chief executive. Roger Jenkins, the high-profile banker who left Barclays in 2009 and reputedly was paid \u00a340m during one of his years at the bank, was credited with playing a key role in introducing the Qatar investors to the fundraising. There had been expectations that Barclays would be offered a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) \u2013 a form of settlement \u2013 similar to those offered to Rolls-Royce, which paid \u00a3671m to settle its case, and Tesco, which was fined \u00a3129m as part of a DPA. But this now seems unlikely. There are two other cases connected to the SFO investigation. Amanda Stavely, an adviser to the UAE\u2019s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who put more than \u00a33bn into the October 2008 financing, has brought a civil action claiming fees for her PCP advisory vehicle. Richard Boath, a former top banker at Barclays, has brought a claim to an employment tribunal. He argues he was unfairly dismissed after the SFO shared with his employer a 900-page transcript of interviews he gave to criminal investigators. Barclays denies wrongdoing in both cases.",

The bank contests the findings, and these regulatory proceedings have been stayed while the criminal investigation continues.</p> <p>When Barclays first announced it was being investigated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/27/barclays-finance-chief-investigated-fsa-fundraising\">by the City regulator in 2012</a>, it disclosed that Chris Lucas, then its finance director, was one of \u201cfour current and former senior employees\u201d being investigated. Lucas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/03/barclays-retirement-finance-director-chris-lucas\">left on health grounds in 2013</a>.</p> <p>It has been reported that during its pursuit of the case the SFO has questioned 44 individuals, including John Varley, the former chief executive. </p> <p>Roger Jenkins, the high-profile banker who left Barclays in 2009 and reputedly was paid \u00a340m during one of his years at the bank, was credited with playing a key role in introducing the Qatar investors to the fundraising.</p> <p>There had been expectations that Barclays would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/21/sfo-mulls-barclays-deal-over-banking-crisis-funding\">be offered a deferred prosecution agreement</a> (DPA) \u2013 a form of settlement \u2013 similar to those offered to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/16/rolls-royce-to-pay-671m-over-bribery-claims\">Rolls-Royce, which paid \u00a3671m to settle its case</a>, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/28/tesco-agrees-fine-serious-fraud-office-accounting-scandal\">Tesco, which was fined \u00a3129m as part of a DPA</a>. But this now seems unlikely.</p> <p>There are two other cases connected to the SFO investigation. Amanda Stavely, an adviser to the UAE\u2019s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who put more than \u00a33bn into the October 2008 financing, has brought a civil action claiming fees for her PCP advisory vehicle. </p> <p>Richard Boath, a former top banker at Barclays, has brought a claim to an employment tribunal. He argues he was unfairly dismissed after the SFO shared with his employer a 900-page transcript of interviews he gave to criminal investigators. Barclays denies wrongdoing in both cases.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Now the UK supermarkets know Amazon is coming \u2013 probably. The biggest and most frightening beast in the retail jungle has signalled it is serious about the grocery business. Jeff Bezos\u2019s monster is making its largest ever acquisition by paying $13.7bn (\u00a310.7bn) to buy Whole Foods Market in the US. The only mild consolation is that the main action is taking place on the other side of the Atlantic and that Whole Foods\u2019 store portfolio in the UK runs to only nine outlets. But, on the generally reliable principle that global domination of a market is usually Bezos\u2019s goal, UK supermarkets will fear a proper scrap once Amazon has overhauled Whole Foods. To date, Amazon\u2019s new adventures in the UK have been small-scale, experimental and mostly confined to London. Amazon Fresh is more developed in the US, and even there its market share is only 0.8% \u2013 but it seems Bezos is now sufficiently confident to push the button. Amazon will attempt to disrupt food retailing and throw serious capital at that project. Don\u2019t be fooled by the fact that Whole Foods is an organic specialist. Amazon won\u2019t stop there. The stock market\u2019s reaction was extraordinary. In the US, Walmart\u2019s valuation fell by almost as much as the sum Amazon is paying to acquire Whole Foods. In the UK, Tesco was down 5% and Sainsbury\u2019s 4%. Morrisons rose 1%, presumably because it already has a supply agreement with Amazon in the UK and thus could become a takeover target if the US giant also wants to buy a UK chain. Therein lies the most intriguing element of the deal: Amazon, the online revolutionary, feels the need to own shops to be big in groceries. It is the reason why UK supermarkets should not conclude that their business models are broken. Amazon is proposing an approach that looks like their own: a mix of online and physical stores. Traditional retailers have always argued that pure online shoppers don\u2019t really exist. Punters are happy to mix and match and use top-up shops between big deliveries, which is one reason why the country is awash with Tesco Metros and Sainsbury\u2019s Locals. The strategy, therefore, is to catch both online and offline baskets. It would seem Amazon agrees. Yet a semi-endorsement of a business model is no comfort if Amazon gets properly serious about food in the UK. The US giant has two advantages: it understands logistics, and its shareholders don\u2019t expect it to make hard profits to be paid as dividends. On the logistics front, Tesco et al are no slouches. One-hour delivery slots are the norm and Ocado, just by being a pioneer, has forced everyone to raise their game. Distributing fruit, vegetables and chilled products via your own vans is also harder than dispatching a book via a third-party courier. Amazon wouldn\u2019t hold all the aces, though you\u2019d bet on it to find a fistful in the end. But the second factor \u2013 the lack of pressure to make bottom-line profits \u2013 cannot be matched. Amazon generates enormous cashflows but its investors are happy to see those returns ploughed into new markets. That has been Bezos\u2019s true brilliance: he has corralled supportive long-term investors who have accepted the explicit bargain that Amazon\u2019s mission is to acquire revenues first and worry about dividends later. That is what makes it such a formidable competitor. Its investors will be happy as long as the share price is rising \u2013 and it is. UK supermarkets\u2019 response will now become a priority concern for their own shareholders. These businesses are not defenceless: they have loyal customers, big buying power and will not be blown away. Indeed, Sainsbury\u2019s purchase of Argos last year already looks a smart effort to get ahead of the game. But investors also know that Aldi and Lidl destroyed profit margins in the sector, slowly but steadily. An Amazonian attack \u2013 when it arrives \u2013 threatens to be similarly relentless. Good news on pensions: auto-enrolment News stories about the future of pensions tend to come under the category of \u201cwe\u2019re all doomed\u201d, peppered with references to deficits and timebombs. How refreshing, then, to see some strikingly positive figures on pensions emerge last week. The number of private-sector workers saving into a pension has rocketed from 55% to 78% of all employees in just the past four years. Among the young, the number is even more impressive; just 24% of 22-to-29-year-olds in the private sector were saving for a pension in 2012, but this almost tripled to 68% by 2016. The reason? The quietly successful roll-out of a gigantic government programme, supported by all major political, called auto-enrolment. Employers now have to offer a pension, put their staff into it, and pay money in. Unlike Australia\u2019s state-mandated scheme, it\u2019s not compulsory for employees to pay in, but opt-out rates have been thankfully low. Only one in 10 employees say they can\u2019t afford to make any contributions. The first test of auto-enrolment was administrative: opening millions of accounts, often with low contributions, and keeping costs capped. By any measure, the scheme has passed. The next test will be increasing the contribution rate. No one pretends that the contributions into auto-enrolled pensions are anything other than puny. Currently, employers only have to pay in 1% of salary, and employees another 1%. Between now and 2019 the contribution rate will be stepped up to 8%, with employees paying 3% of that. Yet even when we reach 8%, the sums still don\u2019t add up. Experts say that you need to put aside at least 15% of salary to fund a decent retirement. We also need to find ways to push self-employed workers into the scheme. So far, auto-enrolment has caused near-zero political controversy. But now politicians need to face up to more painful choices. We need to step the contributions up to 15%, and acknowledge to employers, and employees, that this is going to hurt. Doing the decent thing At a time when the Grenfell Tower fire has made corporate accountability a political issue, it is refreshing to see a company acknowledge the impact of a tragedy involving its own operations. Investigators have not concluded exactly why a FirstGroup-operated tram was speeding so fast when it derailed on a sharp bend in Croydon last November, killing seven people. But in the meantime, FirstGroup boss Tim O\u2019Toole has had his \u00a3723,415 bonus withheld. It is not exactly a Gandhi-esque sacrifice: the decision leaves him with \u00a31.26m in salary and benefits. And should the group\u2019s tram subsidiary emerge in the clear, O\u2019Toole will receive that bonus in shares in 2020 \u2013 which, if he can start to drag his ailing company upwards, could well be worth a lot more then. Yet viewed beside the buck-passing and absent leadership with which London\u2019s most recent disaster has been met, this is, at least, the decent thing.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When I suggested before the election that an ideal outcome would be a hung parliament and a coalition to think again on Brexit, I was certainly not thinking of the DUP. But, as Harold Macmillan once said: \u201cHere we are, and the question is: where do we go from here?\u201d It seems to be generally agreed that the election result boiled down to a vote against austerity and a vote against a so-called \u201chard Brexit\u201d, with the young \u2013 predominantly Remainers and angry about austerity \u2013 in full swing. The vote against austerity was long overdue. Under Cameron and Osborne the Conservatives got away with blue murder in blaming the world financial crisis on Labour in general and Gordon Brown in particular. Their obsession with \u201cthe deficit\u201d hoodwinked people who do not understand that a nation is not a household, and that cuts in public expenditure are the reverse of what is required in a time of depression. All economies need a period of rapid growth after a recession. This was denied the people of this country, who have finally rebelled. Way back in 1980, in the early stages of Mrs Thatcher\u2019s sado-monetarist regime, the great JK Galbraith wrote in this newspaper: \u201cBritish social services and social insurance soften what elsewhere might be intolerable hardship. British phlegm is a good antidote for anger; but so is an adequate system of unemployment insurance.\u201d Unfortunately, the gaps in our social safety net are showing, and in some cases a government obsessed with reducing the size of the state has deliberately ripped that net apart. Thinktanks are vying with one another to tell us about a record period of negligible growth in living standards. Alas, things are becoming even worse as the referendum-induced devaluation bites further into real incomes. The terrible thing about the prospect of Brexit is that our underlying economic situation is already bad enough, and the Brexit decision, if not reversed, is guaranteed to make things a lot worse. In economics there are time lags between announcements and their consequences, and under George Osborne the Treasury overdid its warnings about the timing of the referendum\u2019s effects. Only now are people beginning to realise the consequences of the decision made last year by the world\u2019s financial markets that Britain had, in effect, voted to become poorer and less secure. The devaluation constituted a reassessment of this country\u2019s economic prospects. It was Philip Hammond, Osborne\u2019s successor, who, in challenging Theresa May\u2019s obsession with a hard Brexit, maintained that the people who voted for Brexit did not vote to become poorer. But that is what the 51.9% of those who voted in effect did. There were those who thought that the fantasy of a 150-seat majority would enable May to see off the hard Brexiters and pursue a more sensible policy. But all the evidence suggests that she meant what she said: that she put reductions in immigration above all else, and was prepared to leave the customs union and the single market in order to realise this dubious aim. It is this preparedness to leave the single market that puzzles me most about the Brexiters. On the whole, these are people who worship the memory of Margaret Thatcher and thought she could do no wrong. My own view is that she did quite a lot of wrong, but that the single market was a great achievement, working very much in our economy\u2019s interests. Yet these latter-day Thatcherites are prepared to give it all up in their mystical pursuit of \u201csovereignty\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d. One of the results of the election is that May is now so weakened that she has no alternative but to hang on to a chancellor who knows that Brexit is self-damaging nonsense. Hammond is trying to make the best of a bad job: in remarks on Friday before an EU meeting, he rightly emphasised the need for the UK to concentrate on jobs, growth and the needs of business. Pace the Duke of York, the needs of business do not include Brexit. On the contrary. The Duke of York should stick to what he knows. Earlier in the week, Harvard University released a highly relevant report written by Ed Balls, who needs no introduction, and Peter Sands, former chief executive of Standard Chartered. Originally conceived as a way of helping British business to cope with Brexit, the report seems to this correspondent to deliver a very simple message: British business would rather not have to cope with Brexit at all. Thus, \u201ccontrary to much of the media and political commentary, the majority of businesses \u2026 were broadly satisfied with current regulatory approaches in their sectors\u201d, and \u201cmany spoke to the overall quality of EU regulations and rule-making processes\u201d. This is the nub. It is hardly surprising that Lord Bridges, who has been finding it increasingly frustrating trying to find a workable approach to Brexit for the government, has resigned from the Department for Exiting from the European Union in apparent disgust. Yes, he has exited the Department for Exiting. I am not making this up. And I don\u2019t blame him. When will my old friend David Davis finally get the point? Which brings us to the statesmanlike way in which Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, offered Britain a route back from the cliffs towards which May has been heading: \u201cUntil negotiations come to an end there is always a chance to reopen the door.\u201d Lord Adonis has said: \u201cWe are at a moment of national crisis, with echoes of the 30s.\u201d His fellow peer, Michael Heseltine, has suggested that the problem could be sorted out at heads-of-government level, and that it should not be impossible to achieve the kind of concessions that eluded David Cameron. The stakes are that great!",

      "body": "<p>When I suggested before the election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/04/hung-parliament-can-halt-brexit-disaster\" title=\"\">that an ideal outcome would be a hung parliament</a> and a coalition to think again on Brexit, I was certainly not thinking of the DUP. But, as Harold Macmillan once said: \u201cHere we are, and the question is: where do we go from here?\u201d</p> <p>It seems to be generally agreed that the election result boiled down to a vote against austerity and a vote against a so-called \u201chard Brexit\u201d, with the young \u2013 predominantly Remainers and angry about austerity \u2013 in full swing.</p> <p>The vote against austerity was long overdue. Under Cameron and Osborne the Conservatives got away with blue murder in blaming the world financial crisis on Labour in general and Gordon Brown in particular. Their obsession with \u201cthe deficit\u201d hoodwinked people who do not understand that a nation is not a household, and that cuts in public expenditure are the reverse of what is required in a time of depression.</p> <p>All economies need a period of rapid growth after a recession. This was denied the people of this country, who have finally rebelled. Way back in 1980, in the early stages of Mrs Thatcher\u2019s sado-monetarist regime, the great JK Galbraith wrote in this newspaper: \u201cBritish social services and social insurance soften what elsewhere might be intolerable hardship. British phlegm is a good antidote for anger; but so is an adequate system of unemployment&#xa0;insurance.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, the gaps in our social safety net are showing, and in some cases a government obsessed with reducing the size of the state has deliberately ripped that net apart.</p> <p>Thinktanks are vying with one another to tell us about a record period of negligible growth in living standards. Alas, things are becoming even worse as the referendum-induced devaluation bites further into real incomes.</p> <p>The terrible thing about the prospect of Brexit is that our underlying economic situation is already bad enough, and the Brexit decision, if not reversed, is guaranteed to make things a lot worse. In economics there are time lags between announcements and their consequences, and under George Osborne the Treasury overdid its warnings about the timing of the referendum\u2019s effects. Only now are people beginning to realise the consequences of the decision made last year by the world\u2019s financial markets that Britain had, in effect, voted to become poorer and less secure. The devaluation constituted a reassessment of this country\u2019s economic prospects.</p> <p>It was Philip Hammond, Osborne\u2019s successor, who, in challenging Theresa May\u2019s obsession with a hard Brexit, maintained that the people who voted for Brexit did not vote to become poorer. But that is what the 51.9% of those who voted in effect did.</p> <p>There were those who thought that the fantasy of a 150-seat majority would enable May to see off the hard Brexiters and pursue a more sensible policy. But all the evidence suggests that she meant what she said: that she put reductions in immigration above all else, and was prepared to leave the customs union and the single market in order to realise this dubious aim.</p> <p>It is this preparedness to leave the single market that puzzles me most about the Brexiters. On the whole, these are people who worship the memory of Margaret Thatcher and thought she could do no wrong. My own view is that she did quite a lot of wrong, but that the single market was a great achievement, working very much in our economy\u2019s interests. Yet these latter-day Thatcherites are prepared to give it all up in their mystical pursuit of \u201csovereignty\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d.</p> <p>One of the results of the election is that May is now so weakened that she has no alternative but to hang on to a chancellor who knows that Brexit is self-damaging nonsense. Hammond is trying to make the best of a bad job: in remarks on Friday before an EU meeting, he rightly emphasised the need for the UK to concentrate on jobs, growth and the needs of business. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40296649\" title=\"\"><em>Pace</em> the Duke of York</a>, the needs of business do not include Brexit. On the contrary. The Duke of York should stick to what he knows.</p> <p>Earlier in the week, Harvard University released<a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp77\" title=\"\"> a highly relevant report</a> written by Ed Balls, who needs no introduction, and Peter Sands, former chief executive of Standard Chartered. Originally conceived as a way of helping British business to cope with Brexit, the report seems to this correspondent to deliver a very simple message: British business would rather not have to cope with Brexit at all. Thus, \u201ccontrary to much of the media and political commentary, the majority of businesses \u2026 were broadly satisfied with current regulatory approaches in their sectors\u201d, and \u201cmany spoke to the overall quality of EU regulations and rule-making processes\u201d.</p> <p>This is the nub. It is hardly surprising that Lord Bridges, who has been finding it increasingly frustrating trying to find a workable approach to Brexit for the government, has resigned from the Department for Exiting from the European Union in apparent disgust. Yes, he has exited the Department for Exiting. I am not making this up. And I don\u2019t blame him. When will my old friend David Davis finally get the point?</p> <p>Which brings us to the statesmanlike way in which Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, offered Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/13/brexit-talks-to-start-next-week\" title=\"\">a route back from the cliffs towards which May has been heading</a>: \u201cUntil negotiations come to an end there is always a chance to reopen the door.\u201d</p> <p>Lord Adonis has said: \u201cWe are at a moment of national crisis, with echoes of the 30s.\u201d His fellow peer, Michael Heseltine, has suggested that the problem could be sorted out at heads-of-government level, and that it should not be impossible to achieve the kind of concessions that eluded David Cameron. The stakes are that great!</p>",
