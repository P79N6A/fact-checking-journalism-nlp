Australia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in the March quarter grew a stunning 1.1% in seasonally adjusted terms for an annual rise of 3.5% \u2013 the biggest rise since June 2012.</p> <p>It would take a pretty miserable economist to find negatives, so let\u2019s keep positive but also look under the hood and see what is going on in our economy.</p> <h2>1. Both real and nominal growth is strong</h2> <p>Real GDP in trend terms grew 0.8% in the March quarter, and 3.2% annually, which has it bang on the 25-year average growth. The budget forecast that growth for 2013-14 would be 2.75%, so we can pretty much consider that target beaten.</p> <p>Similarly nominal GDP growth (i.e. the growth of the economy in current dollars) rose 5% in the past year. The budget was predicting growth of 4%, and for next year a mere 3%.</p> <p>This is important given the link of nominal GDP growth with taxation revenue. For the budget predictions to come true, there would need to be a fairly sizeable slowing of the economy in the next 12 months \u2013 if not Joe Hockey will have a lot more revenue than he expected. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/0iG6D/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>2. The export boom is here</h2> <p>Exports of goods and services grew 10.4% (seasonally adjusted) in the past year \u2013 the strongest growth for more than a decade. Even the trend growth of 7.9% is the biggest since September 2000:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/OF15v/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Part of the reason for the big growth is that the summer did not see a high number of cyclones, so ports in our tropics were not shut down as much as they have been in recent years.</p> <h2>3. Mining is still king</h2> <p>The mining boom is dead, long live the mining boom.<br></p> <p>Sure we\u2019re not building so many new mines, but that growth in exports is overwhelmingly coming from the mining sector. In trend terms, the mining sector contributed 1.1 percentage points towards the annual growth \u2013 well in front of the finance and insurance industry\u2019s 0.6 percentage point contribution:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/oa6Dk/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"600\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This is also reflected in the growth in gross value added by each industry. Mining\u2019s annual growth of 11% far outstrips the 7.9% growth of the rental, hiring and real estate industry.

The new king is not the same as the old king</h2> <p>Just in case you are thinking all that growth in the mining sector must mean the economy is going back to the way it was during the mining boom, think again. In the past decade to have the economy growing by more than 3% and yet have Western Australia\u2019s state final demand falling would be inconceivable. And yet that is the case at the moment.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"5\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/FeK6M/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>State final demand is not a state\u2019s \u201cGDP\u201d, it does not include a state production for things that are exported \u2013 either overseas or interstate. But when the investment mining boom occurred, WA\u2019s state final demand was growing by leaps and bounds because it was demanding materials and workers to build mines. Now it isn\u2019t.</p> <p>WA\u2019s annual growth in state final demand has been negative now for four successive quarters. That does not mean WA is in recession, but it does mean this mining boom will not bring with it a boom in employment.</p> <h2>5. Workers are productive</h2> <p>The tears and gnashing of teeth from the corporate sector about how the current IR system is stifling productivity really need to be given a rest. Seriously, you are wrong. Labour productivity continues to do well.<br></p> <p>The ABS figures saw GDP per hour worked increase 2% in the past year. To give that some context in the past decade annual growth has averaged 1.3%.</p> <p>In the more instructive measure of gross value added per hour worked in the market sector, annual growth reached 2.4%. Productivity by this measure has grown more than 2% annually for 11 successive quarters \u2013 the longest such run since June 1999. </p> <p>But given labour productivity is notoriously sluggish to change, if we look at five-yearly growth we get an even clearer picture. Over the past five years labour productivity in the market sector has grown 12.9% \u2013 the best for a decade and an amazing turnaround since the nadir period of 2005 to 2009 when it grew just 4.9%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"6\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/80Hs7/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This productivity is also reflected in a decline in real unit labour costs. This measures the cost to produce one unit of output. It fell 1.5% in the past year. The rise that occurred after the global financial crisis and due mostly to abnormally low inflation has now been reversed:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"7\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/t81pP/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So really, CEOs, employment ministers and the rightwing media really should quit their whining about labour costs and low productivity. The data is laughing at them.</p> <h2>6. We like to drink</h2> <p>We have kept spending in the past 12 months. Household consumption contributed 1.5 percentage points to annual growth, well above that contributed by either state or federal government consumption:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"8\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/pHTfB/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The big rivers in the past quarter were spending at hotels, cafes and restaurants and on alcohol.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Morrisons is set to reveal a management restructuring in its stores within weeks that could lead to as many as 2,000 job losses. The move, resulting from trials of three possible slimmed-down management structures in around seven of its new stores, is likely to affect managers overseeing product categories such as fresh food or non-food across the chain's 500 stores, according to industry insiders. The supermarket group is holding its annual shareholder meeting in Bradford on Thursday, where chief executive Dalton Philips is expected to face anger from investors, including the founding family, after overseeing dramatic declines in sales and profits. Morrisons declined to comment on the potential job cuts. However, the group has previously said that the changes were intended to simplify store management structures and lift the number of staff serving at its fresh food counters. The company has previously said it had no plans for widespread redundancies, and many of the store management staff are expected to be offered other posts within Morrisons, including at its fast growing convenience store business. However, Morrisons is keen to reduce staff numbers as it is under pressure to cut costs to fund its plans for \u00a31bn in price cuts and product improvements over the next three years. Last month Morrisons cut prices on 1,200 items by an average of 17% after poor trade over the key Easter period contributed to a 7.1% slump in quarterly like-for-like sales. Last month it began discussing plans to cut 100 jobs at its warehouse in Wakefield, which is home to about 1,200 workers. The store staff restructure echoes those by major rivals who are also trying to cut costs in stores as grocery sales shift online and prices come under pressure from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. \"Restructures are going to happen everywhere because sales volumes are going down and aren't coming back so to keep shareholders happy costs have got to come down,\" one industry insider said. Asda recently announced it was consulting with 4,100 senior store staff about job cuts as it employs more people in home shopping. It is thought as many as 2,600 of the Walmart-owned chain's staff will leave rather than accept an alternative, lower-paid job. Tesco and Sainsbury's have also restructured their store management teams in recent years. Industry insiders said it was particularly tricky for Morrisons to cut store management staff as its array of fresh food counters carrying out butchery, fishmongery and baking need close supervision to ensure quality and health and safety standards are kept up. Currently each Morrisons store has a manager, a deputy manager and three or four assistant deputy managers who oversee broad product categories such as fresh food. Supervisors for individual departments, such as green groceries, meat or fish, report to them. Roger Owen, the former Morrisons director who recently launched a public attack on the chain's current management team, said he had already noticed a marked reduction in staff numbers in stores and estate management. He said this was having an impact on store standards. \"We can see the results and it's empty shelves,\" he said. \"Where they need to cut costs and staff is in head office.\" Philips has admitted shareholders would \"hold our feet to the fire\" but has insisted they are backing him, saying the new plan was receiving \"broad support\".",

      "bodyText": "Desmond Tutu will lead protesters on Thursday campaigning against British security firm G4S's role in maintaining prisons and detention centres in the West Bank and Israel. The South African retired archbishop and Nobel peace laureate will challenge G4S's management over the company's alleged role in facilitating \"Israel's brutal occupation and abhorrent prison system\" at the company's annual general meeting in London on Thursday afternoon. Tutu, and several other notable protesters including directors Mike Leigh and Ken Loach, philosopher Noam Chomsky and barrister Michael Mansfield QC, have written an open letter to G4S management, published in the Guardian, demanding the company stop supplying equipment to Israeli prisons. \"G4S helps the Israeli Prison Service to run prisons inside Israel that hold prisoners from occupied Palestinian territory, despite the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibition of the transfer of prisoners from occupied territory into the territory of the occupier,\" the protesters wrote. \"Through its involvement in Israel's prison system, G4S is complicit in violations of international law and participates in Israel's use of mass incarceration as a means by which to dissuade Palestinians from protesting Israel's systematic human rights abuses.\" The protesters claim that human rights organisations have documented \"systematic torture\" and ill treatment of Palestinian prisoners, including children held in solitary confinement, at some of the Prisons. In a separate letter to the Guardian a number of MPs, including Jeremy Corbyn and Joan Ruddock, said children were reportedly ill-treated in the prisons and called on G4S to \"terminate its contracts with facilities where children suffer routine physical and verbal abuse\". G4S, which employs 8,000 in Israel, said it \"takes very seriously our obligations to ensure that our activities do not contribute to human rights abuses\". An independent human rights report commissioned by G4S following similar protests at last year's AGM found the company \"had no causal or contributory role in human rights violations\". \"There are clearly human rights failings in some parts of Israel's security system, but G4S's role is far removed from their immediate causes and impact,\" the report by Hugo Slim, a research fellow at the Institute of Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict at the University of Oxford, said. This week the UK government's National Contact Point watchdog launched an investigation into G4S's activities in Israel and the West Bank. The National Contact Point, which is part of the department for Business, said it had \"accepted issues for further examination\". It follows a formal complaint by Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, a charity that has long criticised G4S.

The warning by the Standard &amp; Poor's agency came amid fresh estimates of the regulatory costs facing the European banking industry, which could leave a $104bn bill for a catalogue of errors ranging from tax evasion and mis-sold financial products to manipulation of financial markets. Analysts at Credit Suisse doubled their estimates for the costs of the scandals which have gripped the industry since the financial crisis. Upping their estimate to $104bn from $58bn, the Credit Suisse analysts forecast that litigation facing Royal Bank of Scotland could further delay the government selling off its 83% stake. US authorities accuse BNP Parisbas of breaking sanctions on Sudan, Iran and Syria over a seven-year period to 2009. S&amp;P said that the potential settlement with the US had forced it to consider a potential downgrade to BNP's A plus rating and place the bank on \"credit watch negative\", until the outcome of the discussions with the US authorities is known. The situation facing BNP is causing concern in France where it has emerged that president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande had written to Barack Obama in April to complain the fine would be disproportionate. The pair are due to meet in Paris over dinner where Hollande will raise the situation in person with the US president, according to the Reuters news agency. The boss of BNP, Baudouin Prot, had been expected to attend a key conference in London organised by the trade body Institute of International Finance but he did not attend the discussion on the future of finance. George Osborne told the conference that he was preparing to clean up foreign exchange markets in the wake of allegations of rate rigging, amid reports that he will announce a crackdown in a setpiece speech at Mansion House next week. The chancellor told the IIF conference: \"What I have got to make sure is that whatever happens as a result of those investigations, we are \u2026 bolstering the integrity of the London markets.\" In another session, Antony Jenkins, the chief executive of Barclays, told the audience of finance professionals that there was more to be done on reforming culture and bankers' pay. Speaking in the Methodist central hall in Westminster, Jenkins \u2013 who has been dubbed St Antony in some circles for his attempts to clean up the bank in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal \u2013 said there were commercial reasons for improving a bank's culture. \"There's ethical reasons and productive and business reasons \u2026 this isn't about running for a sainthood, this about sound commercial principles,\" he said. He has focused the bank on five key principles \u2013 respect, integrity, service, excellence and stewardship \u2013 since taking the helm in September 2012, and is sending 2,000 top managers on two-year training. He said the \"market should correct over time\" as investors demanded better returns. Barclays has still faced criticism over its pay policies and was also fined last month of systems lapses which allowed a trader to manipulate the gold market on the same day the Libor fine was announced in June 2012. Manipulation of other markets is also being investigated by regulators, including foreign exchange and which the Chancellor intends to impose more regulation on. The outspoken investor Davide Serra, who runs Algebris Investments, told delegates that he wondered why more bankers were not in jail as a result of the regulation clamp down. According to the Credit Suisse analysis the $1O4bn estimate is just over half the $201bn of losses incurred during the subprime crisis which crippled European banks and some $39bn of provisions are yet to be taken by the industry.",

It said that if the major retailers in the US raised wages to the equivalent of $25,000 for full-time work, it could lift almost half a million women out of poverty or near-poverty.</p> <p>\u201cWalmart moms\u201d walked off their jobs to take part in protests outside their stores in a number of cities including Orlando and Chicago, joining those who have already staged strikes earlier this week in Dallas, Pittsburgh, southern California and the Bay area.</p> <p>Strikes were expected to take place in 20 cities on Wednesday. The protesters, who include current Walmart workers as well as members of the allegiance Our Walmart, are demanding annual wages of at least $25,000, more full-time openings and an end to retaliation against workers who speak out against their conditions.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the National Labor Relations Board <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/15/walmart-complaint-violating-rights-workers-protest\">filed a complaint</a> against Walmart for, it said, illegally retaliating against 60 workers who had taken part in legally protected strikes or protests.</p> <p>Mother of three Linda Haluska, 52, who works in a Walmart store in Glenwood, told the Guardian she was travelling to the protest in Chicago. Haluska has worked for the company for eight and a half years and now earns $28,000.

      "bodyText": "Working mothers at Walmart staged a series of strikes on Wednesday in protest over wages and conditions at the world's largest retailer, as a new report claims the company's top executives received $104m in taxpayer subsidies over a six-year period. The majority of mothers working at Walmart, which drew a $16bn profit last year, earn less than $25,000 a year. This week, a study by thinktank Demos detailed how 1.3 million women working in retail live on or near the poverty line. It said that if the major retailers in the US raised wages to the equivalent of $25,000 for full-time work, it could lift almost half a million women out of poverty or near-poverty. \u201cWalmart moms\u201d walked off their jobs to take part in protests outside their stores in a number of cities including Orlando and Chicago, joining those who have already staged strikes earlier this week in Dallas, Pittsburgh, southern California and the Bay area. Strikes were expected to take place in 20 cities on Wednesday. The protesters, who include current Walmart workers as well as members of the allegiance Our Walmart, are demanding annual wages of at least $25,000, more full-time openings and an end to retaliation against workers who speak out against their conditions. Earlier this year, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against Walmart for, it said, illegally retaliating against 60 workers who had taken part in legally protected strikes or protests. Mother of three Linda Haluska, 52, who works in a Walmart store in Glenwood, told the Guardian she was travelling to the protest in Chicago. Haluska has worked for the company for eight and a half years and now earns $28,000. She said she was striking in solidarity with others who earn less, and what she described as worsening conditions at the company. Haluska works the night shift at the store's health and beauty department and supplements her income by working as a teaching assistant during the school term. \u201cI started off at the bottom, like everyone else\u201d said Haluska. \u201cBut I've seen things change: the erratic scheduling, the lack of flexibility. It's hard to get a day off when you want. They make it very clear that Walmart comes first. Your job is always on the line.\u201d Haluska said that some of her co-workers on the night shift who can't afford cars have to wait outside for up to an hour for the bus to arrive \u2013 a situation some staff said was potentially dangerous. Workers and their trade union supporters are currently making their way to Bentonville, Arkansas, where the annual Walmart shareholders meeting is expected to take place on Friday. Walmart has been criticised in the past for paying workers such low wages that their workers rely on food stamps and other subsidies. A report published on Wednesday raised a separate issue over Walmart and tax, in terms of a loophole the study said had given the company a tax break of $104m, enough to cover the cost of free lunches for 33,000 schoolchildren. In its report, the Institute for Policy Studies and lobby group Americans for Tax Fairness calculated that between 2009 and 2014, the top eight Walmart executives took home more than $298m in \u201cperformance pay\u201d that was fully tax deductible. The performance pay tax break was made possible by a 1993 change in the tax code meant to discourage excessive executive compensation. The rule capped the amount corporations could deduct from their income taxes for executive pay at no more than $1m per executive. But the law exempted stock options and other so-called \u201cperformance pay\u201d from the cap. \u201cWhen Walmart gets a $104m tax break for giving its executives outrageous pay packages, [and] the rest of us pick up the tab,\u201d said Frank Clemente, executive director at Americans for Tax Fairness. \u201cWith this tax loophole, the bigger the executive bonuses, the less Walmart pays in taxes.

      "bodyText": "The pressure has increased on Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke after he revealed the supermarket's worst sales performance in decades, despite spending over \u00a31bn on store revamps and price cuts in a fightback against discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Tesco's sales fell by 3.8% in the three months to 24 May on a like-for-like basis, an acceleration of the 3% slide in the previous quarter. Several analysts noted that the fall would have been 4% if Tesco had used the same standards used by most retailers, which exclude fuel, VAT and sales paid for with vouchers. Clarke admitted the sales decline was the worst he could remember in a more than 30-year career at the supermarket group, where he first started working as a schoolboy shelf-stacker in 1974, but insisted it was partly driven by Tesco's own actions to cut prices and revamp stores: \"I haven't seen a quarter of like-for-like sales like this before that I can remember but I haven't seen a period of transformation like this for the industry,\" he said. Clarke is trying to revive sales at Tesco's UK business by revamping stores and cutting prices on staples such as bacon, eggs and bread amid tough times for all the major grocers who have seen sales hit as cost-conscious shoppers look for bargains. He said that volumes had jumped 28% on sales of goods where price cuts had been made but the turnaround plan would continue to affect performance this year as price cuts took time to lure customers back. He is ditching short-term promotions and aiming to win long-term loyalty through sustained price cuts on the products which Tesco customers bought most often as well as money off petrol for Clubcard shoppers through the Fuel Save scheme. \"I see every day the improvements in the business but I'm not making any promises about sales improvements in the next few quarters,\" Clarke said. He said he didn't think it would be possible for Tesco to refurbish stores at a faster pace without major risk but he thought the effort was necessary. \"We can emerge a winner,\" he said. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, calculates that only half of the latest sales falls were the result of price cuts, disruption caused by store revamps and less use of discount vouchers. It means that, even without those self-inflicted hits, Tesco would still be losing sales. \"We expect this quarter to represent a low point for Tesco but there is no return to positive like-for-like (sales growth) in sight,\" Monteyne wrote. Other analysts suggested that Tesco's sales performance was only likely to get worse in the coming quarter as Clarke indicated that he was planning further price cuts. Analysts at Espirito Santo suggest a revival could take five years. Richard Hunter, head of UK equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: \"Investors need to ponder whether Tesco is a company showing glimpses of revival given its turnaround plan, or whether it is past its sell by date.\" Tesco is not the only major supermarket struggling to tackle rapid change in the industry amid the rise of discounters such as Aldi, Lidl Poundland and B&amp;M Stores as well as the rise of online shopping and convenience stores. Clarke said the Tesco Express convenience chain had seen a 1.4% rise in underlying sales and online sales were up by 9% in the quarter showing it had a stake in those fast-growing sectors. But he also said the whole industry was seeing the impact of a squeeze on shoppers spending power since 2008 and said that they were still not feeling the benefits of lower inflation and the economy's recovery. Some big investors are losing patience with Clarke, who is 18 months into his plan to revive Tesco after UK profit fell for the first time in 20 years. Clarke said: \"You're right, it is 18 months and they are the worst numbers but we accelerated our plans in February because we could see how the plan will work and the pace of change is huge. It has some headwinds and some consequences.\" He declined to comment on discussions with Tesco's major shareholders, saying they were \"confidential to us\". But he added: \"I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to see through the fundamental reshaping of Tesco. I have got so much energy, determination and passion.\" Tesco shares fell 1.3% to 293.5p on the news. Recent industry data shows that Tesco appears to have lost more than 1m customer visits per week, worth \u00a325m in sales, with its market share showing the biggest fall for at least 20 years. A survey published on Tuesday by Kantar Worldpanel showed the grocery market was at its weakest for at least 11 years and that excluding inflation and population growth the market was stagnant. In the 12 weeks to 25 May, Tesco's market share dropped to 29% from 30.5%. \"",

Here's some snippets from its early research note:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decline in exports was principally due to a 2.2% m/m decline in food exports and a 1.3% m/m decline in automotive exports. </p> <p>In the other direction, food imports increased by a further 1.9% m/m in April, following a massive 10.9% m/m jump in March. Automotive imports increased by a very strong 3.4% m/m.</p> <p>We're obviously wary of falling back on using the weather as an excuse again, but the extreme cold winter, coupled with the drought in California, does partly explain why the US is suddenly importing a lot more food and exporting less. The weather hit crop yields and the pandemic that has reduced the domestic pig stock is another factor. The jump in automotive imports in April fits with the news yesterday that motor vehicle sales surged to 16.7 million annualised in May, from 16.0 million in April. An imported vehicle that is sold obviously, by definition, doesn't add anything to gross domestic product.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up.... JP Morgan has declared that the global economy enjoyed its best month since last September, with output and job creation rising at a faster pace in May. With manufacturing and service sectors in many countries expanding at a solid pace, there is optimism that \"the upturn may even build up further steam\" in the second half of 2014. The UK economy led the way, with service sector companies reporting strong growth again. And a separate report showed that job creation across Britain's private sector hit its fastest rate since 1997. The eurozone is also on track for its best quarter since 2011. Spain posted its seventh month of service sector growth. ...but France lagged behind, with its service sector suffering a contraction. There was mixed data from America -- private sector jobs creation missed forecasts and the trade deficit expanded; the US service sector grew more strongly, though. The day began with Tesco reporting its worst quarter in decades. Analysts warned that the company's CEO could lose his job if he can't turn the situation around, as the UK's largest retailer struggled to cope with price wars and the popularity of discount supermarkets. Poll: Will Philip Clarke be Tesco's CEO in a year The eurozone could soon be expanded to 19 members, as the EC declares that Lithuania has met the criteria to join the single currency. While the Athens parliament has voted to withdraw immunity from three Golden Dawn MPs, after dramatic scenes in parliament. And protests outside. And stock markets ended the day mixed, as investors waited to hear whether the European Central Bank announces dramatic action tomorrow. Cheers, and goodnight. GW European markets have closed, as the City braces itself for tomorrow's central bank meetings, particularly the ECB. FTSE 100: down 17 points at 6818, German DAX: up 5 points at 9925 French CAC: Down 1 point at 4501 Jasper Lawler, CMC Markets analyst, sums up the day: It was sour trading in Europe today with mixed services PMIs on the continent and weak US employment and trade data adding to a general unwillingness of traders to take big positions ahead of tomorrow\u2019s ECB rate-setting meeting. The UK services PMI beat expectations with just a small drop to 58.6. The PMI beat is going to add further to speculation of a rate rise if the data feeds through to another strong quarter of growth. While inflation is below the 2% threshold it seems likely the Bank of England will hold steady at tomorrow\u2019s meeting and probably until 2015. The FTSE 100 has continued to falter below 14 year highs around 6,900 and is eyeing up the low formed on May 20th around 6,775. Healthcare was the best performing sector with Smith and Nephew the standout performer while National Grid continues to pull down Utilities shares. Global economic growth has hit its highest rate in eight months. That's the conclusion of all this week's PMI surveys of manufacturing and service companies across the globe, released by Markit and the ISM since Monday. JP Morgan, which compiles most of the data, has concluded that its \"Global All-Industry Output Index\" rose to 54.3 in May, up from 52.8 in April. The UK and the US remained the leading drivers of the expansion, while the eurozone recovery also picked up. David Hensley, director of Global Economics Coordination at J.P.Morgan, reckons the recovery may gain speed later this year: \u201cGrowth of global economic output and new business both registered solid accelerations in May, to more than recoup the momentum loss signalled by April\u2019s softer readings. The manufacturing and service sectors both showed renewed vigour and job creation remains on the up. On this basis, it looks increasing likely that this performance will not only be sustained, but that the upturn may even build up further steam as we move into the second half of the year.\u201d And this chart shows how the UK's private sector outperformed other countries, partly thanks to this morning's strong service sector data (see here). The full report is online here (as a pdf). Just in: growth in America's service sector accelerated in May. The Institute for Supply Management has reported that the US service sector PMI rose to 56.3, up from 55.2 in April. This is the 53rd month in a row that the Service sector PMI has come in above the 50-point mark, indicating expansion. Mind you... it did take the ISM three attempts to get May's manufacturing PMI right on Monday*, so the organisation is getting some grief on Twitter: * - the ISM accidentally used the wrong data to adjust for seasonal factors - dubbed a 'cringe-worthy' blunder in some quarters. Here's a few photos of the protests in Athens as MPs voted to strip Golden Dawn's leader, and two other deputies, of their immunity from prosecution today. As reported at 11.41am, GD leader Nikos Michalolikos is charged with operating and directing a criminal organization. He was arrested last year, after the murder of left-wing rapper Pavlos Fyssas prompted a clampdown on the party. Here's Bloomberg's take: Greek Parliament Lifts Immunity for Golden Dawn Chief, Lawmakers The New York stock market just opened for business, and the main indices have dipped in early trading following the weaker-than-expected jobs data (details here). The Dow Jones index fell 31 points, or 0.2%, to 16691, and the Nasdaq dipped 0.4%, or 17 points, to 4216. The row swirling around the huge fine looming over BNP Paribas for sanction-busting has taken another twist, with S&amp;P putting France's largest bank on \"creditwatch with negative implications\". The announcement means BNP's credit rating (currently A+) could be downgraded by one notch if US regulators do impose a hefty financial penalty. The French government has raised the stakes over the fine this week, with foreign minister Laurent Fabius declaring yesterday that $10bn fine was not\" reasonable\". It emerged this morning that president Francois Hollands will discuss the issue with president Obama later this week. Can the jump in the US trade deficit in April, to a two-year high of $47.2bn, be blamed on the bad weather? Capital Economics thinks it's a factor, at least. Here's some snippets from its early research note: The decline in exports was principally due to a 2.2% m/m decline in food exports and a 1.3% m/m decline in automotive exports. In the other direction, food imports increased by a further 1.9% m/m in April, following a massive 10.9% m/m jump in March. Automotive imports increased by a very strong 3.4% m/m. We're obviously wary of falling back on using the weather as an excuse again, but the extreme cold winter, coupled with the drought in California, does partly explain why the US is suddenly importing a lot more food and exporting less. The weather hit crop yields and the pandemic that has reduced the domestic pig stock is another factor. The jump in automotive imports in April fits with the news yesterday that motor vehicle sales surged to 16.7 million annualised in May, from 16.0 million in April. An imported vehicle that is sold obviously, by definition, doesn't add anything to gross domestic product. But it was also the case that sales of domestic vehicles increased to 13.1 million last month, from 12.7 million, so there is still a positive story here. Two more pieces of US economic data just hit the wires - and neither are very impressive. America's trade deficit has widened to its largest level in two years, with exports falling by 0.2% in April and imports rising by 1.2% Meanwhile, US productivity fell at its fastest rate in six years in the first three months of 2014. It's probably a temporary blip; firms struggled to complete work in the bad winter weather, which also dragged the economy into a small contraction. And via fastFT, here's a bar chart putting the slowdown in US private sector job creation last month into context: Job creation across America's private sector has slipped to its lowest level since January, according to the monthly ADP survey. ADP reported that 179,000 new jobs were created by US firms in May; a four month low, and shy of forecasts. Economists had forecast a 210,000 increase in the US private sector workforce -- so this may suggest that Friday's Non-Farm Payroll (the wider measure of the American labour market) will miss forecasts. No major reaction in the markets, though. Here's the instant reaction: SocGen's Kit Juckes points out that today's US mortgage data was also a disappiontment -- Mortgage applications fell 3.1% in the last week of May. The main European stock markets have all lost a little ground today, as traders wait for tomorrow's European Central Bank meeting. FTSE 100: down 20 points at 6815, - 0.3% German DAX: down 17 points at 9901, -0.2% French CAC: down 4 points at 4499, -0.1% Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, says there's no stomach for a rally. Insofar as we can say that markets have been driven by anything, and they certainly haven\u2019t been driven very far, it is uncertainty ahead of the ECB and what Mario Draghi might or might not do that is the key factor. Tesco's shares are still in the red, down 1.1% after reporting that 3.8% slump in sales in the last quarter (as covered in the early posts): McCaig points out that Tesco's CEO is under growing pressure. Philip Clarke\u2019s stewardship does not appear to be going according to plan, boosting calls for his departure, but the supertanker that is Tesco takes a long time to turn around, and patience may well be rewarded. However, the stock market is not known for this quality and the inevitable result could be another shakeup that simply leaves the titan directionless for even longer. Back to the news that Lithuania has been given the EC's blessing to join the eurozone.... and Reuters has produced a fact box explaining why six other countries did not make the cut. BULGARIA Legislation not fully compatible, especially the law on the national central bank. Misses the exchange rate criterion because its currency is not in the ERM2. THE CZECH REPUBLIC Misses the exchange rate criterion and its national legislation does not fully guarantee the independence of the central bank. CROATIA Its deficit and debt are too high, its currency has not been in the exchange rate mechanism HUNGARY Its laws on central bank independence are insufficient, it does not meet the exchange rate criterion. It has debt above the 60 percent ceiling. POLAND Law on central bank does not guarantee full independence, there is no prohibition of monetary financing. Poland also does not meet the Polish zloty exchange rate criterion and has a budget deficit that is higher than 3 percent of GDP. ROMANIA Misses the inflation criterion. Officials have concerns about the independence of the central bank, prohibition of monetary financing and the central bank's integration into the euro system at the time of joining the single currency area. From Athens, Helena Smith confirms that 223 MPs voted in favour of stripping Golden Dawn leader Nikos Michaloliakos, and two other MPs, of their parliamentary immunity. One, an independent, voted \"present.\" (effectively abstaining). It's the first time in history of Greek political life that a democratically elected party political leader will face prosecution at behest of his fellow MPs, she adds. Reports coming in that the Athens parliament has voted to strip three Golden Dawn MPs of their immunity from prosecution (see 11.41am onwards for details) Greek MPs are now voting on whether to lift the immunity from prosecution on Golden Dawn's MPs. Golden Dawn leader Michaloliakos told MPs that he is an \"unrepentant nationalist\", Helena reports. That will strike a chord with Greeks who feel they have been desperately humiliated by outsiders (for which read the troika) waging a war of austerity against the country. He described his handcuffs as being \"an honour\" to wear, Helena adds. Over in Greece, neo-nazi Golden Dawn\u2019s party\u2019s imprisoned leader is currently testifying before the Athens parliament. It comes ahead of a crucial vote on whether to remove the 'immunity from prosecution' currently enjoyed by his party's MPs. Helena Smith, our correspondent, reports on what is likely to be a big day for the far rightists For the first time in the history of the Greek parliament an elected political party leader has been brought before the House in handcuffs and under draconian security. Imprisoned for the past eight months on charges of operating and directing a criminal organization, Golden Dawn\u2019s leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, was rushed through the side door of Athens\u2019 parliament building as around 500 diehard Golden Dawn supporters, gathered in Syntagma square, shouted \u201cleader, leader, our great leader.\u201d In an unprecedented step, police cordoned off the central boulevard that runs past the parliament - and stepped up security in the House itself - in a bid to thwart incidents of violence. Helena adds: Michaloliakos was taken to parliament with his second-in-command Christos Pappas and Ioannis Lagos, an MP accused of ordering the killing of a Greek rapper last year, who like him are also being held in pre-trial custody at Athens\u2019 top security Korydallos prison. All three will deliver testimonies of defense before the House. As I write Lagos is giving a rousing speech denunciating the \u201cfabricated charges\u201d brought against him. To his left and right are Micholiakos and Pappas seated in the benches reserved for Golden Dawn MPs. The 300-seat House will then question the MPs with a view to lifting their parliamentary immunity from prosecution - another first for a leader brought to power by democratic process. The far rightists, who have gone out of their way to sanitize their image in recent months \u2013 with once leather jacketed deputies now donning suits \u2013 are using their unexpectedly good showing in local and European elections last month to make the point that Greeks don't believe the accusations. Golden Dawn, which has campaigned on an anti-bailout anti-EU ticket, emerged as the country's third biggest political force in the elections and is by far Greece\u2019s fastest growing party. The EC's official statement, saying Lithuania is ready to join the euro, is here: Commission assesses eight EU countries\u2019 readiness to join the euro area; proposes that Lithuania join in 2015 But in Brussels, the FT's Peter Spiegel is pointing out to Rehn that the European Central Bank's own assessment of Lithuania's economy is somewhat more sceptical about the country's readiness (the ECB's report is here). Rehn replies that there is significant 'convergence' (hoho) between the EC and ECB's reports. Olli Rehn added that joining the eurozone will be a major, hard earned and welcome achievement for Lithuania and its people. Over in Brussels, the European Commission has given Lithuania the green light to join the eurozone. Yes, two years on from the heights of the debt crisis, countries are looking to join the euro rather than quitting it. In its latest 'convergence report', the EC has concluded that Lithuania meets all the criteria for joining the euro. That is a crucial step for the small Baltic state to meet its goal of becoming the 19th member of the single currency from the start of next year. The report states that Lithuania's inflation rate, fiscal position and exchange rates mean it meets all the criteria for eurozone membership. A final decision will be taken by EU finance ministers in the second half of July EU commissioner Olli Rehn is giving a press conference on the news now (live feed). He is explaining that the decision recognises Lithuania's long-standing commitment to sound fiscal policies and economic reforms since the break-up of the Soviet Union. Reuters has more details: To adopt the euro, a country has to have government debt no higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product, a budget deficit below 3 percent of GDP, low inflation and interest rates and its own currency has to be stable against the euro. The formal decision to accept Lithuania into the euro zone will be taken by EU finance ministers in the second half of July, at which point the ministers will also agree on a conversion rate of the litas currency into the euro. The remaining seven countries that still remain outside the euro zone -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden -- do not meet all of the criteria to adopt the currency. But it's a darker picture in the eurozone, with Eurostat reporting that the prices charged by manufacturers continued to fall in April, adding to deflationary pressures. Producer prices fell by another 0.1% during April, meaning they were 1.2% lower than a year ago. Another reason for the European Central Bank to take new measures tomorrow. Not that every expert believes they'll cut interest rates.... Here's another sign that the UK labour market has improved (on top of the surge in hiring) The UK's Office for National Statistics has issued data this morning showing that Britain's employment rate has, finally, returned to its long-term average: That comes from the ONS's June Economic Review (online here). The ONS also takes a stab at how much spare capacity is still lingering in the UK economy - by adding up the total full and part time hours worked, plus how much extra hours people want to work, and the work lost through unemployment. Back in the eurozone.... Eurostat has confirmed that GDP across the euro area grew by just 0.2% in the first three months of 2014. That is in line with its initial estimate. Eurostat also confirmed that Hungary and Poland were the fastest growing member of the EU, both expanding by 1.1%. The Netherlands suffered the deepest contraction, shrinking by 1.4% (mainly due to a tumble in energy use in the mild winter). Job creation across the entire UK private sector remained at April's 17-year high in May, Markit has also calculated. It says: The strongest rate of job creation was seen in the construction industry, followed by services. Although still robust, employment growth in manufacturing was tempered by the desire to boost productivity. This comes alongside today's strong service sector (details), which indicated that the economy is maintaining quarterly growth of 0.8%. The manufacturing and construction PMI surveys also showed solid growth, indicating \" another strong expansion of the UK economy in the second quarter of 2014\". Chris Williamson of Markit explains: With every strong PMI reading, the more lively the discussion will become among the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee that a pre-emptive early hike in interest rates is warranted. However, with inflationary pressures remaining subdued, the case for higher rates is by no means clear cut. The manufacturing sector is expanding at the fastest pace right now, Markit reckons: Although the rate of increase slowed very slightly, it remained close to an all-time high and indicative of the sector expanding by approximately 1.5% in the second quarter. This would be the best performance the goods-producing sector has seen since the initial rebound from the financial crisis in the second quarter of 2010 and builds on the strong 1.4% rise seen in the first quarter. The full report is here. Just in -- UK service sector firms are taking on staff at a rate not bettered in 17 years, as activity continues to grow strongly. And in another encouraging sign - they're paying their staff more too, as new orders flood in. Markit's monthly healthcheck of Britain's service sector showed that activity increased fairly strongly in May. The Services PMI came in at 58.6, showing strong growth, and only slightly slowed than April's 58.7. It reports that: Business activity in the UK service sector continued to increase markedly during May, supported by another firm increase in volumes of incoming new work. Capacity was subsequently tested and encouraged service providers to take on staff at the joint sharpest rate since May 1997. Wages were also reported by a number of service providers to have increased, which led to the sharpest rise in operating costs for four months. Chris Williamson, Markit chief economist, says: \u201cThe UK economy continued to boom in May, in what is the best spell of growth since 2007. The buoyant services PMI follows similar upbeat manufacturing and construction reports, which collectively suggest that the economy is on course to grow by 0.8% again in the second quarter. Here's some instant reaction: David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, says firms are now prepared to pay more, take on more staff and invest in new capacity: \u201cFirms in the services sector are creating jobs at a level seen only once since 1997 and offering bigger salaries to boot; a sign of ever-increasing confidence in the sector, which is enabling firms to support expansion and take advantage of improved economic conditions. \u201cWhilst increased salaries are driving up operating costs, alongside suppliers looking to increase their margins, there is willingness to invest. This is being driven by strong domestic and overseas markets, suggesting we can be confident this positive trend will continue.\u201d This chart shows how France's private sector has slipped back into contraction, while Spain and Italy's firms are finally reporting growth. Oh, and we're running a poll on whether Phil Clarke will still be Tesco CEO in a year's time: Poll: will Philip Clarke still be the head of Tesco in 2015? City Index's Josh Raymond reckons pressure will mount soon... while the Evening Standard's Russell Lynch think it's long overdue... Our full story on Tesco's results, and the pressure mounting on Phil Clarke, is here. (Tesco's shares are now down almost 1%, by the way, as the City digests the details) The eurozone private sector is on track for its best quarter in three years, despite being dragged back by France's weak economy. Data firm Markit reports that its Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index came in at 53.5 for May, slightly lower than April\u2019s near-three year high of 54.0. That shows that manufacturing and service sector firms across the region continued to expand last month. Markit reckons that the \"recoveries at both manufacturers and service providers\" continued last month. But the gap between the eurozone's two largest economies remained wide in May. Germany continued to report strong output growth, with manufacturers and service providers both benefitting from rising new order inflows. In contrast, output in France fell back into contraction, reflecting the ongoing weakness of the French domestic market. Elsewhere among the big-four economies, output rose further in both Italy and Spain. Rates of growth ticked higher in Italy and stayed close to April\u2019s seven-year record in Spain. Today's data also suggests that private sector companies are helping to ease the eurozone unemployment crisis - but not in France. Markit says: Germany and Spain reported further jobs growth, while Italy saw a slight increase for the first time in three years. France reported further cuts. Reaction to follow... Germany's service sector grew at the fastest pace in almost three years, putting France's trouble into stark perspective. Markit's Service sector PMI rose to 56.0, from 54.7 in April, showing that activity picked up. It's an \"encouraging sign\" for Germany's economy, Markit says. The bad news keeps coming for France too --- its service sector has slipped back into contraction. Data firm Markit reports that its French service sector PMI fell to 49.1 in May, from 50.4 in April, indicating that activity across the sector fell. The decline was driven by another drop in new business, forcing companies to cut employment at a sharper rate. Firms also slashed output prices at a faster pace, despite a stronger rise in input costs. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, warned that France's economy doesn't appear to have recovered from the first three months for 2014, when GDP was flat. \u201cThe French service sector disappointingly sank back into contraction territory during May, with activity falling for the first time in three months. A sluggish demand environment was blamed for a further drop in new business, while companies responded by cutting employment again. What\u2019s more, competitive pressures necessitated a sharper cut in output prices despite faster input cost inflation, putting pressure on companies\u2019 operating margins. After GDP stagnated in Q1, there seems to be little evidence of the French economy turning the corner so far in the second quarter.\u201d That poor Russian economic data means it's heading into recession, suggests Chris Williamson of Markit. We've also seen evidence that Russia's economy is continuing to deteriorate. Output across Russia's manufacturing and service sectors fell at the fastest rate in five year, according to HSBC data. Firms slashed staff at the fastest rate since September 2009, as new orders slumped. HSBC's Russia Services Business Activity fell sharply to 46.1, from April\u2019s 46.8, signalling the fastest rate of contraction since May 2009 (anything &gt;50 means activity fell). And the geopolitical crisis with Ukraine is hurting the Russian economy. Firms cited political uncertainty, inflation and weaker investment spending as reasons why activity may continue to fall. Alexander Morozov, HSBC's chief economist for Russia, warned that the contraction of the Russian economy gained momentum in May, led by its service sector. \u201cOverall, the PMI survey signals another leg down in the Russian economy is most likely in the coming months before the situation can start improving, if the resumption in new order growth in manufacturing continues. The ongoing recovery in the 'transport &amp; storage' sector in services is also encouraging in this respect.\u201d Speaking of the eurozone, the FT's Peter Spiegel suggests that we may get an update on Lithuania's bid to join the single currency later today. (that's midday Brussels time, or 11am BST) In the eurozone, Spain's service sector has now expanded for the seventh month running, although the pace slowed a little last month. Markit's monthly PMI index, which measures activity across the sector, dropped to 55.7 May from 56.5. Crucially, that's still over the 50-point mark showing growth. Markit reported that new orders rose strongly, but there was little sign of job creation. And firms also cut their output prices again in an attempt to drive demand -- adding to deflationary pressures. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, says the Spanish service sector continued on the road to recovery in May... However, there was further evidence of a reluctance among companies to increase staffing levels at a rate comparable with growth of new work, despite another build-up of outstanding business and strong optimism regarding the prospects for growth of activity. Tesco's boss may only have a year to get things right, reckons Julie Palmer, retail expert at Begbies Traynor. She says: With growing scepticism over the viability of his plans and leadership, I expect Philip Clarke has at most 12 months to prove his worth before investors demand more drastic measures.\u201d Palmer explains that Tesco's management the critical blunder of assuming that the good times would last forever, and failed to move with the times: \u201cWhile Aldi and Lidl have carved out a customer base at the value end of the market, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s in the middle and Waitrose and M&amp;S at the top, Tesco\u2019s brand identity has lost its way. The Group\u2019s overhaul of its shopping experience couldn\u2019t come sooner as customers have been put off by Tesco\u2019s complex multiple buy offers and outdated stores, which are only now being upgraded.\u201d Palmer adds that Tesco's \"depleted management\" are now lurching from crisis to crisis, under-delivering in the UK as they try to fix its international estate (our 7.38am post showed how sales fell overseas too). Veteran analyst David Buik says Tesco's shares rose this morning because today's numbers are \"marginally less awful than expected\". The London stock market is open.... and Tesco's shares have risen almost 2%. Some analysts had predicted an even steeper fall in sales, of up to 4.1%, so there's relief that today's figures aren't worse. Phil Clarke insisted that his strategy is working. But John Ibbotson, director of the retail consultants, isn't convinced. Ibbotson says: \"Despite the PR spin, Philip Clarke's turnaround plan is not working.\"Revamping stores with posh bakeries, Giraffe restaurants and a paltry \u00a3200m in price cuts is not enough to address the seismic shift in UK retailing.\" Ibbotson reckons Tesco needs to unleash the \"big bazooka\" of heavy price cuts. Otherwise, it's market share will continue to be gobbled by low cost discounters, Aldi and Lidl, and, at the other end of the spectrum, Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer. Tesco CEO Phil Clarke is fielding questions from financial reporters on today's results. My colleague Sean Farrell is on the call, and reports that Tesco is promising more price cuts ahead -- but also vowing to end short-term gimmicks. Clarke also admitted that he can't remember a quarter quite as bad as the last one..... There's not much in Tesco's results to inspire confidence, says Josh Raymond of City Index. While ITV's Joel Hills spies trouble ahead: This chart shows how the fierce price war raging in Britain's supermarket sector sent Tesco's UK sales sliding in the last three months, at a faster rate than the previous quarter: And Britain isn't the only market where it's struggling -- like-for-like sales fell by 5.5% in the Republic of Ireland, by 1% across Europe as a whole, and by 3.2% in Asia. Tesco insists that the situation is improving, though, saying: Our like-for-like sales performance in Asia has improved since the last quarter despite the continued effect of the political situation in Thailand. In Europe, like-for-like sales were positive in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Polandand Turkey. Whilst Ireland remains intensely competitive with high levels of untargeted couponing in the market, our performance there is starting to improve. Tesco's troubles continue, with a hefty drop in sales across the UK as chief executive Phil Clarke continues to battle to turn Britain's biggest retailer around. It has just reported that like-for-like sales in the UK slumped by 3.8% in the last quarter. Tesco blames a tough trading environment, with rival supermarkets slashing prices in an attempt to lure customers down their aisles instead. Lower food prices have also hit turnover. Clarke, who took over in 2011, is pinning his turnaround strategy on creating 'long-term' loyalty among customers, rather than blasting shopper with 'untargeted promotions\". Tesco is 'sharpening' prices, Clarke says, rathe than simply slashing away indiscriminately. But he admits that repairing Tesco's fortunes will take time, warning: We are pleased by the early response to our accelerated efforts to deliver the most compelling offer for customers. We expect this acceleration to continue to impact our headline performance throughout the coming quarters and for trading conditions to remain challenging for the UK grocery market as a whole. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. There's lots for data junkies this morning. New Service Sector data is being released through the day, showing how the private sectors in Asia, Europe and the Americas fared. We also get updated eurozone growth figures -- the first estimate, last month, showed that the euro region grew by just 0.2%, with France stagnant. While in the corporate world Tesco, the UK's biggest retailer, is reporting results -- just a day after analysts reported it had suffered its worst three months sale period in 20 years . And in the financial markets, tension is growing ahead of tomorrow's European Central Bank meeting -- what will the Governing Council do to fight deflation and stimulate growth?... I'll be tracking all the key events through the day",

      "bodyText": "A healthy UK services sector in May with rising workloads, employment and confidence, has cemented expectations that the UK's economic recovery powered ahead in the second quarter. An improving economic backdrop has sustained growth in services, which accounts for more than three-quarters of the economy, with companies hiring staff at the fastest rate in 17 years to keep up with workloads across hotels, restaurants and other parts of the sector. The Markit/CIPS services PMI measuring activity in the sector dipped slightly to 58.6 in May from 58.7 in April, where anything above 50 indicates growth. The City had expected a slightly bigger dip to 58.2. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg, said that, taken together with equivalent surveys for the manufacturing and construction sectors earlier in the week, the services PMI boded well for the economy. \"The UK economic engine keeps running red hot. Services and construction PMIs may have fallen a bit below their peaks in recent months, but the speed of the economic recovery remains very impressive. There is no evidence that it is about to slow significantly.\" Economic growth between April and June is expected to at least match first quarter growth of 0.8%, if not beat it. The strength of the recovery is likely to keep the spotlight on the Bank of England's rate-setting monetary policy committee, which has left interest rates at an all-time low of 0.5% despite the brighter outlook. Governor Mark Carney has repeatedly argued that the MPC is in no rush to raise rates, with the first rise most likely in the second quarter of 2015, around the time of the next general election. However some economists \u2013 including those at Berenberg \u2013 believe the first rise will come at the end of 2014. James Knightley, economist at ING, said: \"For now we favour a February 2015 first rate hike, but depending on how aggressive the Bank is at the 17 June Financial Policy Committee meeting in terms of adopting measures to slow the property market in London and the south-east , we are increasingly tempted to bring it forward.\" The employment measure on the May services PMI rose to 56.2 in May from 56 in April, matching the level reached in October 2013 which suggested that services companies have not hired staff at a faster rate since May 1997.",

      "body": "<h2>John Ibbotson, director at retail consultants Retail Vision</h2> <p>Despite the PR spin, Philip Clarke's turnaround plan is not working. Revamping stores with posh bakeries, Giraffe restaurants, and a paltry \u00a3200m in price cuts is not enough to address the seismic shift in UK retailing. Tesco's market share is being destroyed by the low-cost discounters, Aldi and Lidl, and, at the other end of the spectrum, Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer. Another major problem is that the hypermarket model is fast becoming redundant. Nobody needs or wants a superstore any more.</p> <p>Two-hundred million pounds in cuts is nothing when Asda and Morrisons are both returning \u00a31bn to customers. Clarke's only option now is to get out the big bazooka and blow the competition away. He needs to halve his industry-leading margin of 5% and put it into price cuts, cut capital expenditure, and reduce overheads.</p> <h2>Louise Cooper, independent City analyst</h2> <p>There is no sign that the deterioration is bottoming out. The sales performance is still getting worse. And yet Tesco describes the 1Q sales in the top paragraph as \"in line with last year's exit rate\", which I am not even sure what it means. But it sounds like Tesco is trying to suggest that the performance is not getting worse, when clearly it is.</p> <p>There are excuses aplenty for the deterioration in performance, as ever with retailers. The normal ones are the timing of Easter and weather. Tesco is not using those old chestnuts but instead using the reduction of couponing as a new excuse and the \"deflationary impact of investment in lower prices\" ... Investment normally refers to an asset \u2013 something with ongoing value, a machine or a computer. Something that creates sales. Clearly a price cut fits neither of these criteria. It is not an asset on the balance sheet and does not create sales \u2013 it hits sales.</p> <h2>Bruno Monteyne, retail analyst at Bernstein Research</h2> <p>We expect this quarter to represent a low point for Tesco, but no return to positive like for like [sales is] in sight. It is likely that half of the negative like for like is caused by price cuts, store disruption from revamps and less indiscriminate vouchering... Tesco has failed to adapt to the change in competition from space race to distinct-offer competition. By raising prices faster than anybody else, we think that Tesco has lost its differentiation, giving a free ride to the targeted retailers at both ends of the spectrum (value and quality). The \"accelerated\" strategy is unconvincing: it is still trying to be everything to everybody and the only thing that has accelerated are market share losses.</p> <h2>Julie Palmer, partner at business recovery firm Begbies Traynor</h2> <p>After delivering super profits for many years, Tesco's management let success go to their head and assumed the good times could continue forever \u2013 a major mistake. While Aldi and Lidl have carved out a customer base at the value end of the market, Asda and Sainsbury's in the middle and Waitrose and M&amp;S at the top, Tesco's brand identity has lost its way. The group's overhaul of its shopping experience couldn't come sooner as customers have been put off by Tesco's complex multiple-buy offers and outdated stores, which are only now being upgraded ... With growing scepticism over the viability of his plans and leadership, I expect Philip Clarke has at most 12 months to prove his worth before investors demand more drastic measures.</p> <h2>Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers</h2> <p>Investors need to ponder whether Tesco is a company showing glimpses of revival given its turnaround plan, or whether it is past its sell-by date. The wider ferocity of competition is making the implementation of the plan more difficult to achieve, although the company is trying to position itself within the three largest requirements of the supermarket sector at present, in the form of price, online and convenience stores ... As Tesco continues to try to repair the decline in its market share and reputation, investors are being rewarded with a healthy 5% dividend yield which, whilst attractive in the current interest rate environment, may not be enough of a reward for patience.</p> <h2>Mike Dennis, consumer sector analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald</h2> <p>Tesco mentions that lower food prices and reduced couponing have impacted their figures more than most, even though this time last year Tesco's sales were held back both by the transfer of store general merchandise sales online and the equine DNA impact on chilled and frozen food lines. Our view is that Tesco's core 482 superstores remain vulnerable in undifferentiated categories where discounters have made considerable inroads. The key concern now is that if UK [like-for-like] sales growth rates continue at this level then management might need to consider cutting capital investment again ... Investors should be questioning management's strategy and why the prior year's UK investment has led to falling sales.</p> <h2>Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre:</h2> <p>Tesco is suffering at the expense of high end retailers and discounters, and today's figures are likely to leave a sour taste in the mouth of its investors. But Tesco is not on its own. Morrisons too has seen its profit margins under pressure, with the two dragging down the performance of the UK listed firms in the sector. It's clear that Tesco's turnaround has some distance to go yet, and investors will be watching carefully for the impact of its price-slashing policy and store-revamps on its bottom line for the remainder of the year.</p> <h2>Jonathan Jackson, head of equities at Killik &amp; Co</h2> <p>Although Tesco continues to see a positive contribution from its transformation programme, performance in the UK remains subdued, while concerns persist over the group's ability to generate attractive returns overseas. We believe the strategic reallocation of capital away from large out-of-town stores towards convenience stores and online channels is the right one, but the process is slow and is occurring at a time of intense competition in the grocery market and rapidly shifting consumer shopping habits. The story remains one of long-term term recovery, with plenty of execution risks and, as a result, the outlook for future profitability is uncertain. The shares currently trade on 11x consensus 2015 earnings. Although in the face of an ongoing subdued trading environment, the shares may struggle to perform in the near term, the 4.7% dividend yield continues to provide support.</p> <h2>Espirito Santo analysts</h2> <p>We think Tesco remains a fixable business ... but we think Tesco trading in the UK will remain subdued over the near-term and think UK margins could fall closer to zero in the medium term. We argue a turnaround at Tesco could take another five years if near-term lateral thinking is not implemented.</p>",
