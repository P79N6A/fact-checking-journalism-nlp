      "bodyText": "The euro crisis is a key factor in Britain's return to recession, after fears of a Greek exit triggered a sharp rise in borrowing costs for UK firms, according to a Bank of England policymaker. Funding costs for UK banks have soared as international investors worry about the possible collapse of the single currency, said monetary policy committee member Ben Broadbent. UK banks, which are considered to be vulnerable to the potential domino effect of eurozone countries running out of funds, have passed on the costs to British businesses as the panic has spread. Efforts by the Bank of England to flood financial markets with cheap money and bring interest rates to a historic low have had little effect in recent times, he said, and are likely to carry on being blunted by the ongoing crisis. David Cameron has voiced his frustration at the handling of the crisis by eurozone leaders on several occasions. Last week, he called for \"decisive action\" to bring stability to Europe and allow businesses to plan ahead. The Treasury has blamed the downturn over the last six months on the deteriorating economic picture across the Channel, but has mainly focused on the loss of orders to British businesses. Broadbent argues that higher bank loan charges have encouraged firms to reject borrowing for long-term investments in favour of hoarding cash. He warned that infrastructure projects, which can take several years to complete, were the most vulnerable to credit rationing. The situation in the eurozone worsened yesterday after Spain's borrowing costs jumped towards the significant 7% level that analysts believe indicate a country is heading for bankruptcy. Broadbent said: \"It would be nice to think that these worries are unfounded \u2026 unfortunately, I doubt that's the case. \"Markets and businesses possess 'animal spirits' and can over-react to events. They may have done so again. But there's probably a premium on risky investments because there is genuine economic risk.\" A resolution has seemed further away following the election as president of France of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who has sought to make access to vital European Central Bank funding easier, but who remains at loggerheads with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the terms of the loans for indebted eurozone countries. Broadbent said it was possible to see from interest-rate trends over recent decades how the ability of central banks to influence high street borrowing rates has waned, leaving central bankers almost impotent in their efforts to spur growth. While the central bank was crucial in the event of a disaster and had played a significant role in preventing the financial crash turning into a calamity, it struggled to influence the cost of day-to-day borrowing for mortgage customers and businesses, he said. \"It remains the case that, for the time being at least, the most important policy decisions affecting the UK are being taken in other parts of the continent,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "It's almost a year to the day since BP and the oligarchs at Alfa-Access-Renova (AAR) agreed to bury the hatchet and \"intensify their efforts\" to ensure the \"continued success\" of their TNK-BP joint venture in Russia. Few believed then the pair could sustain the appearance of harmony for long: the bitterness caused by BP's (doomed) attempt to agree a separate deal with Rosneft to explore the Arctic ran too deep. Even fewer will believe in a happy ending after the latest development \u2013 the resignation of Mikhail Fridman, one of the four tycoons, as chief executive of TNK-BP. BP is whistling cheerfully that Fridman's role in the post has \"largely been ceremonial\" but its own chief executive, Bob Dudley, carries enough scars from past dealings in Russia to be wary. The natural interpretation of Fridman's resignation is that AAR wants something, which is why the air is thick with talk of a \"breakdown in governance\" at TNK-BP and the arrival of \"the endgame\" for the relationship. The question is what AAR wants. It's probably not a desire for BP to repeat last year's offer to buy AAR's holding for $36bn (\u00a322.95bn). It seems more likely that the oligarchs would wish to pitch for all or part of BP's 50% shareholding. But BP certainly isn't going to agree to be a minority investor \u2013 that would be inviting more trouble. And Dudley knows he would lose his job if he agreed to sell at less than a soaraway price, which AAR seems very unlikely to offer. So prepare for the endgame, if that's what it is, to be messy. One immediate battleground is TNK-BP's dividend. It disappeared last quarter because after the resignation of two independent board members last December there aren't enough directors to sanction a payout. A few quarters of delay can be tolerated by BP. But the oligarchs' calculation may be that a dividend-gusher, which is what TNK-BP is meant to be, becomes gradually less valuable for a UK oil giant if the cash doesn't arrive reliably. Fridman may also have noticed the decline in BP's share price, which has lost touch with 500p since February and on Monday slipped below 400p. That's remarkable when you remember that the post-Macondo low was only 320p. From the point of view of a strategically minded oligarch, it's the perfect moment to create fresh worries for BP shareholders. It's still May, but Dudley should prepare for a long Russian winter.",
