      "bodyText": "There was a passage missing from Andrea Leadsom\u2019s pitch for the leadership of the Conservative party: an apology to the governor of the Bank of England, or, failing that, a retreat from the nasty attack on his integrity during the EU referendum campaign. Leadsom was a leader of the leave camp\u2019s attempt to portray Mark Carney as chancellor George Osborne\u2019s stooge. The governor was undermining the Bank\u2019s independence, ran the poisonous argument, by warning of the short-term impact of a Brexit vote on the UK economy and the value of the pound. Leadsom\u2019s comments were personal. \u201cAs an ex-Goldman Sachs banker, Carney knew exactly what he was doing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has encouraged financial instability and I think that absolutely damages the reputation of the Bank.\u201d To fair-minded observers, Leadsom\u2019s claim was utter nonsense. Carney played by the book. He was careful to speak about Brexit only as it related to the Bank\u2019s remit of promoting monetary and financial stability. It would have been absurd to expect silence. The Bank had to undertake preparatory work in case, for example, sterling fell by 10% against the dollar, as it has done. Thus, Carney had to explain \u2013 and be cross-examined on \u2013 the Bank\u2019s thinking and analysis. Other prominent Brexiters have sought to build bridges. Boris Johnson, in his infamous Telegraph article, got one thing right: he said Carney was doing a \u201csuperb job\u201d. Michael Gove, launching his bid for leadership, endorsed the \u201cwise action\u201d taken by the governor after the vote. Leadsom should have taken her cue from them. She should also have noted that Carney, after his speech last week about the Bank\u2019s post-referendum response, had to bat away questions about his personal position should Leadsom become prime minister or chancellor. A clearly exasperated Carney replied that he had been expressing the collective views on the risks to the economy of 15 members of the Bank\u2019s monetary and financial stability committees. \u201cDoes anyone in the country think those risks have not begun to manifest?\u201d he said. \u201cWe did our job.\u201d Even after that exchange, Leadsom found no room in her prepared speech on Monday to mention Carney or the Bank. There are only two explanations. She may lack the experience or humility to admit she went too far during the referendum campaign. Or she still believes what she said about the governor abusing his office. Either version would be alarming in a candidate to be prime minister. Is LSE-Deutsche B\u00f6rse merger really Brexit-proof? \u201cI would like to thank our shareholders for their strong support for the merger,\u201d said Donald Brydon, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, as 99.9% of votes were cast in favour of combining with Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Well, yes, that\u2019s a thumping majority. Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s shareholders will probably also give a thumbs up, though perhaps not so overwhelmingly. But that will only mark the start of the fun. The deal is still at the mercy of regulators and politicians. The regulators ought to be the easier hurdle. The structure of the deal is Brexit-proof in the sense that German regulators can continue to oversee the German end of things, and the Brits can do likewise on their own patch. That was the logic of creating a \u201ctopco\u201d holding company in which the regulated entities sit underneath. Politicians are unpredictable, however. For some, the fact that the holding company would be based in the UK is suddenly not a technical detail within a happy \u201cmerger of equals\u201d. If political anxiety leads to demands for a domicile in Frankfurt, all bets are off. The partners, assuming they were willing to be bossed about, would have to return to shareholders for a vote on a new structure. In that interval, share prices could move, provoking demands for the merger terms to be revised. Quite right, too, since a Frankfurt domicile would be a straightforward takeover by Deutsche B\u00f6rse, for which the LSE\u2019s shareholders would expect to receive a premium. LSE\u2019s share price is trading about 8% below the merger terms, illustrating the nerves. That\u2019s understandable. The deal looked Brexit-proof until Brexit actually happened. Now it\u2019s a 50:50 call. Standard Life\u2019s UK property fund suspends dealings The appeal of property funds to retail investors is baffling. First, most well-off punters are already massively exposed to property via owning a house. Second, the illusion of liquidity evaporates when there is a stampede for the exit. Investors in Standard Life\u2019s UK real estate fund have discovered the latter drawback. The fund manager has suspended dealings after a rush of requests for redemptions. Investors can see that Brexit probably isn\u2019t good news for commercial property prices and they\u2019d like their money back at the old valuation. Sorry, but life \u2013 or, at least, investment in property funds \u2013 doesn\u2019t work so simply. Properties can\u2019t be turned into cash overnight and Standard Life is obliged to protect the interests of investors who wish to stay. If you don\u2019t like the rules, choose a different investment.",

      "bodyText": "And finally.... here\u2019s our news story about Standard Life\u2019s move: Goodnight! GW But ITV business editor Joel Hills flags up that Standard Life last locked down its property fund eight years ago, when the financial crisis was raging: That was also the last time that the UK economy went into recession. Property valuations are usually an early casualty of a downturn. Estate Gazette point out that Standard Life cut the value of its portfolio by 5% as part of a \u201cfair value adjustment\u201d, but this was not enough to prevent investors wanting to take out their cash. They add, uncheerily, that: The move mirrors that made by fund managers in 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which resulted in some funds being closed for years as those managing funds struggled to return capital when faced with depressed asset values. Property expert Henry Pryor reckons this might be a significant event.... Aime Williams of the Financial Times has a good take on the Standard Life news: Standard Life has been forced to stop retail investors selling out of one of the UK\u2019s largest property funds after rapid cash outflows were sparked by fears over falling real estate values in the week after the Brexit vote. The \u00a32.9bn commercial property fund will need to sell real estate to raise cash before any money can be redeemed. The last property crash in the UK in 2007 was preceded by a wave of similar forced gatings by funds struggling to meet investor demands for cash, which led to firesales of property that added to the pressure on an already falling market.... More here: The Economist\u2019s Buttonwood columnist, Philip Coggan, says Standard Life has highlighted the stress building up in the financial system following the Brexit vote. He writes that some fund managers have already reassessed the value of their property assets, downwards, since the referendum. Some real estate investment trusts have fallen by 20%. Coggan explains why the decision to suspend redemptions from Standard Life\u2019s \u00a32.7bn property fund matters: The big question is how this news will affect retail investors elsewhere. The risk is of a run; if buyers fear they will lose access to their money, they will rush to withdraw their savings, triggering the event they dread. Property mutual funds have a liquidity mismatch; savers can withdraw their money every day but property takes months to sell. Funds tend to run with high levels of cash in order to meet this eventuality; Aberdeen says its fund has a cash level of 18% of assets. But Standard Life clearly felt it had to take action. Regulators worried last year about the possibility of systemic risk in the mutual fund sector, although then their concern was about corporate bonds, rather than property. The good news is that this is not like the money market fund crisis of 2008; few people will be keeping their spare cash in a property fund and most will realise that they can lose, as well as make, money. Nevertheless, this is the first real sign of post-Brexit financial stress. Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, has emailed his thoughts about Standard Life\u2019s decision to lock down its property fund tonight: He explains: Property funds are clearly under pressure as a result of the Brexit vote, and we could now see a new wave of investors being unable to liquidate their property funds quickly, which we last witnessed during the financial crisis. This is part of the problem with investing in open-ended property funds, and one of the reasons we don\u2019t recommend them to investors. Property does offer diversification, and a reasonable yield compared to government bonds, but investors must be willing to accept high costs, and a lack of liquidity when the market turns down. Closed-ended property funds at least provide investors the chance to sell out during market upheaval, though widespread selling serves to depress share prices and widen discounts in times of stress. Indeed there are currently a number of closed-ended property trusts trading at discount in excess of 10%. However, being closed-ended does at least means the manager does not have to liquidate properties at a time when everyone else is looking to do the same. Given the outflows the sector seems to be experiencing, this could well put downward pressure on commercial property prices. The risk is this creates a vicious circle, and prompts more investors to dump property, until such time as sentiment stabilises. Continued low interest rates in theory provide support for commercial property, because as prices fall, yields become even more attractive. However at the moment, investors appear to be leaving the sector, rather than buying in.\u2019 City experts are tweeting their concern about Standard Life\u2019s decision to suspend trading in its real estate fund: Big news tonight... Standard Life, one of Britain\u2019s biggest investment funds, has suspended trading in one of its UK property funds. This means customers will not be able to pull money out of the fund, which invests in UK property assets such as offices, shops and industrial sites. Standard Life took the decision after receiving a surge in applications to withdraw from the fund, following the Brexit vote. By locking investors down, they hope to avoid being forced into fire sales to generate funds for clients who want out. They say: Due to exceptional market circumstances, Standard Life Investments has taken the decision to suspend all trading in the Standard Life Investments UK Real Estate Fund (and its associated Feeder Funds) from 12:00 noon on 4 July 2016. The decision was taken following an increase in redemption requests as a result of uncertainty for the UK commercial real estate market following the EU referendum result. The suspension was requested to protect the interests of all investors in the fund and to avoid compromising investment returns from the range, mix and quality of assets within the portfolio. They will review the decision in a month. Here\u2019s the full statement: I\u2019ll find some reaction now.... The London stock market closed down 55 points tonight, or almost 1%, after the shock fall in construction output dampened the mood in the City. Property firms remained the big fallers, with British Land losing 7.1% and Persimmon down 6.9%. With Wall Street shut for Independence Day, trading petered out across Europe. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index had another weak day, dropping 2%. Italian banks came under more pressure as investors wonder if prime minister Matteo Renzi will defy Brussels and bail the sector out of its bad debt crisis. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: In the absence of US markets it\u2019s been a fairly quiet day for European markets which have slipped back in the absence of any significant positive drivers, and very thin trading. The ripple out effects of last month\u2019s Brexit vote continue to dominate sentiment after S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded economic growth forecasts for both the UK and the Euro area, with the UK feeling the main brunt of some of the negative effect. Once again it\u2019s been house builders and banks that have driven today\u2019s losses, with the Italian FTSEMib sliding the most as its banking sector gets clobbered again. Before I nip off....unions are urged the government to boost infrastructure spending to help the construction industry. Frances O\u2019Grady, General Secretary of the TUC, says: \u201cThe Brexit vote is likely to further damage the confidence of investors in the construction sector. The government must respond quickly with an emergency programme of public investment to stop the UK economy taking a nose-dive. \u201cThe TUC has published a plan of action to keep the economy moving. The government must give the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow, bring forward major new infrastructure projects like high-speed rail and announce a big expansion in housebuilding.\u201d The Brexit vote appears to have triggered a change of heart in government circles about spending. On Friday, chancellor George Osborne revealed he is abandoning his deficit reduction plan. And today, leadership contender Stephen Crabb proposed borrowing \u00a3100bn to boost capital spending. It\u2019s quite a u-turn..... A quick recap of the main points. Britain\u2019s construction industry has suffered its worst month since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009, in a clear signal that the EU referendum has hurt the economy. Data firm Markit found that activity shrank sharply in June, with firms reporting a big drop in new orders. Many clients were unwilling to commit to projects before the referendum on 23rd June. Economists say the data is \u2018dire\u2019. They fear that the slowdown will continue this month. Shares in property companies and construction firms have been hit. British Land, the UK\u2019s largest commercial propert firm, has shed 7% . This dragged the FTSE 100 back into the red, after it hit a 10-month high this morning Brexit fears have also hit the eurozone, with investor confidence hitting an 18-month low. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has warned that Brexit could take a 4.5% chunk out of the UK economy by 2019. In other news.... three former Barclay traders have been found guilty of rigging Libor London Stock Exchange shareholders have approved its merger with Deutsche Bourse Spanish unemployment has shown a welcome fall, hitting the lowest total since 2009 But concern is growing over Italy\u2019s banking sector, as its government considers defying the EU and launching a taxpayer bailout. I\u2019ll be back later with the European stock market close.... The FTSE 100 has now fallen back from its 10-month high, and is now 30 points in the red (down 0.5%). Property firms and builders are the biggest fallers on the index, as investors react to the news that the UK construction industry is shrinking at its fastest pace since 2009. The FTSE 250 index, which contains firms who aren\u2019t big enough for the Footsie 100, is down 1.7%. Andrew Edwards, CEO of ETX Capital, says today\u2019s slump in construction activity is proof that the Brexit vote will have a material impact on the UK economy. He calls it \u201ca wake-up call for whoever is taking the country into negotiations for leaving the EU\u201d, and predicts it will spur that Bank of England to ease monetary policy this month. He adds: The rally in the FTSE 100 is not a good guide \u2013 the weighting towards international companies does not represent the UK economy as a whole. Defensive stocks and miners remain in vogue while builders and others in the property sector are getting hammered again.\u201d Hat-tip to Stephanie Flanders of JP Morgan for showing that the FTSE 100 index has actually been the best-performing asset class since the Brexit vote (in local currency terms, anyway). The worst asset? The British pound (closely followed by the Italian stock market, due to those bank fears we mentioned earlier). Just in... the London Stock Exchange\u2019s shareholders have overwhelmingly voted to approve the proposed takeover by Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank. Some 99.89% of LSE shareholders backed the plan at a vote this lunchtime. That\u2019s one hurdle cleared. But the Brexit vote has created a new layer of uncertainty about the \u00a321bn deal. My colleague Sean Farrell explained earlier: Germany\u2019s markets regulator BaFin said last week the plan to base the combined company in London would not work if the UK was outside the EU. BaFin said it was difficult to imagine the most important exchange in the eurozone being run from outside the EU. BaFin cannot veto the deal but Deutsche B\u00f6rse will have to respond to the regulator\u2019s concerns along with the German state of Hesse, where the company is based and which has a veto power. Several German politicians called for the combined company\u2019s base to be in Frankfurt, while Thorsten Sch\u00e4fer-G\u00fcmbel, a leading SPD politician, said the deal was dead. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, has told Le Monde that UK GDP could lose between 1.5% and 4.5% by 2019 because of Brexit, depending on what type of trade deal is struck. Lagarde said there was a \u201creal uncertainty\u201d surrounding what conditions there would be for trade deals with the EU after a Brexit. She said a Norway-style agreement would be the \u201cfavourable\u201d and \u201ceconomically reasonable\u201d choice but she said this choice would be \u201cpolitically difficult, because the country would have all the obligations of an EU member, notably free movement, but no rights.\u201d She said the worst scenario for Britain would be a as non-EU country along World Trade Organisation rules. She said in that case, British GDP could lose between 1.5% and 4.5% by 2019, compared to what it would have been if it had stayed in the EU. But she added.... \u201cBut we don\u2019t have the slightest idea of the timeframe, nor the result of negotiations between London and the EU. Uncertainty will be the key word for a certain time.\u201d Over in the courts, three ex-Barclays traders have been found guilty of fixing the Libor rate \u2013 the benchmark measure of borrowing costs between banks. Bloomberg have created a nice graphic, showing how the City has a dominant position in the \u2018clearing market\u2019 for financial securities denominated in euros. Those huge operations could potentially be moved out of the City, if Britain can\u2019t reached a Brexit deal that grants full access to the EU financial services market. The European Central Bank recently tried, and failed, to get euro clearing moved into the eurozone. But Britain\u2019s referendum means the idea is being reconsidered. France, in particular, fancies a slice of the euro clearing market. Economy minister Emmanuel Macron declared yesterday that: \u201cOn clearing, we will have a full discussion on a series of issues We have many more players now in Paris than in Frankfurt, and a much deeper market place.\u201d However, financial firms will be reluctant to shift the complex euro clearing operations from London to another country. And if there\u2019s no choice, they might scatter jobs across several cities, rather than simply shifting everything to one site. Shares in Moneysupermarket, the price comparison website with the irritating adverts*, have slumped by 11% today to a 16-month low. And again, the Brexit vote is to blame. The selloff was sparked by Barclays, who warned that Moneysupermarket will suffer badly if Britain slides into recession. Barclays analyst Andrew Ross slashed his recommendation on the stock to \u2018equal weight\u2019, from \u2018overweight\u2019, and declared: The outcome of the UK referendum and a forthcoming expected recession in the UK is now a new concern, and one uncertainty too many for us. We do see clear risks to consensus for next year if a recession bites. * - actually, most of them have irritating adverts, although those Meerkats are quite cute... German thinktank Sentix has also sounded the alarm about the impact of Brexit on Europe\u2019s economy. Sentix\u2019s index of investor confidence across the eurozone has slumped to 18-month low, down from 9.9 in June to just 1.7 this morning. That indicates that investors and analysts fear that Britain\u2019s vote last month to leave the European Union will have serious economic consequences. Sentix fears that the European recovery is now faltering. \u201cInvestors are clearly differentiating and in addition to Switzerland, they see the euro zone as mostly affected.\u201d Therefore the euro zone economy is dangerously close to stagnation.\u201d The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies is sliding deeper into the red, following the construction data shocker. It\u2019s now shed 1.7%, or 279 points. Estate agent Rightmove (-5.8%) and building firm Bellway (-4.2%) are among the fallers. Dan Davies of Frontline Analysts isn\u2019t impressed: Here\u2019s our news story about the construction industry\u2019s problems: The early rally on the London stock market has been snuffed out. Investors aren\u2019t pleased by the news that UK construction suffered its biggest slump in almost seven years in June. British Land and Land Securities, two of Britain\u2019s largest property firms, have both fallen by 3.7%. Housebuilding firms are also among the top fallers, with Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments all shedding at least 3%. Joshua Raymond of IG explains why..... UK construction is truly in the doldrums, if today\u2019s PMI reading is anything to go by. A seven-year low for the construction PMI reading highlights the fact that many firms have seen investment ground to a halt both before and after the Brexit vote. With around 80% of responses within this PMI survey coming prior to the referendum result, there is reason to believe that this will look even worse in a month\u2019s time. Considering that we were looking at PMI readings approaching 65 less than two years ago, it is clear that construction has gone from boom to bust in no time at all. Upon enacting Article 50, the government will ignite another two years of uncertainty, which will most likely result in further suffering for UK industry as investment goes elsewhere. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says today\u2019s construction industry report is \u201cabsolutely dire\u201d. It will fuel serious concern that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU will hurt building firms badly, if clients lose confidence in new projects. He adds: The government will be particularly worried to see housebuilding contract at the fastest rate since December 2012 and the second fastest rate since April 2009 - given that it is looking to address the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage There was also substantial weakness in commercial activity, which contracted at the fastest rate since February 2013 and at the second fastest rate since December 2009. Civil engineering activity was essentially stagnant. The downturn in the construction sector will put more pressure on the Bank of England, Tom Moore adds: \u201cThe vast majority of June\u2019s survey responses were received ahead of the EU referendum, so the worry is that the ensuing political turmoil will hit construction spending decisions for some time to come. As a result, the latest figures raise the likelihood that the Bank of England will inject additional stimulus this summer in an attempt to dampen the short-term impact of Brexit uncertainty on the real economy.\u201d The rapid tumble in UK construction work last month is a \u201cclear warning flag\u201d of the dangers facing Britain\u2019s economy. So argues Tim Moore, economist at Markit: \u201cWidespread delays to investment decisions and housing market jitters saw the UK construction sector experience its worst month for seven years in June. Construction firms are at the sharp end of domestic economic uncertainty and jolts to investor sentiment, so trading conditions were always going to be challenging in the run-up to the EU referendum. However, the extent and speed of the downturn in the face of political and economic uncertainty is a clear warning flag for the wider post- Brexit economic outlook. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says the \u201cambiguity and indecision\u201d around Brexit caused the shocking slump in building activity last month. \u201cGloom and fragility descended on the sector with the steepest drop in new orders since December 2012. Caused by the continuing insecurities in both the global and UK economies and the hesitancy shown by clients to commit to projects before the EU referendum, overall activity was at its frailest for seven years. This chart shows how construction contracted last month, with housebuilding (in blue) particularly badly hit. Breaking: Britain\u2019s building sector has suffered its biggest slump in activity in seven years. It\u2019s a clear sign that the EU referendum has hurt the economy. Data firm Markit reports that residential house building suffered a \u201csteep decline\u201d in June, while commercial construction activity shrank for the first time since May 2013. Markit says that many building firms saw their new work dry up last month, as the Brexit campaign reached its climax: Lower levels of activity were overwhelmingly linked to deteriorating order books and a corresponding lack of new work to replace completed projects. A number of firms commented on reluctance among clients to commence new contracts in the run-up to the EU referendum, alongside ongoing uncertainty about the general economic outlook This dragged Markit\u2019s construction PMI down to 46.0 in June, down from 51.2 in May. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction, and 46.0 is the lowest reading since September 2009. Most of the survey was conducted before the results was known, on June 24. More details and reaction shortly.... Conner Campbell of City firm SpreadEx sums up the morning: Once again the best performing index the FTSE rose another 10-20 points after the bell, briefly pushing it above the 6600 mark for the first time since last August (i.e. just before Black Monday). Investors seem to be dining out on the promise of stimulus from the Bank of England (and, likely, the ECB), news of which gave the markets another shot in the arm just when their recovery could have begun to flag. Understandably the pound hasn\u2019t been equally as excited about this development, though its 0.2% rise this Monday has seen cable briefly graze $1.33. Italy is battling to prevent its banking sector becoming a casualty of the Brexit crisis. Shares in Italy\u2019s main lenders are all down, again, today, in a fog of confusion over their prospects. Britain\u2019s EU referendum vote has piled more pressure on Italian banks. If the eurozone economy weakens, their bad debts could be even harder to service. Prime minister Matteo Renzi is reportedly planning to step in and bailout the sector with government cash. That would be a clear breach of new European rules which make creditors, not taxpayers, take the hit when a bank fails. As the FT reports, Rome is considering going it alone: We are willing to do whatever is necessary [to defend the banks], and do not rule out acting unilaterally, although that would only be as a last resort.\u201d But such a move would seriously undermine Europe\u2019s new banking regime. Economists at Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s have issued a new warning about Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. S&amp;P, which downgraded the UK last week (just as Iceland\u2019s footballers were downgrading the England team) has warned that Brexit uncertainty will wipe 0.8% off eurozone growth. They say: We think the U.K. will barely escape a full-fledged recession caused by Brexit, but the downside risks are numerous. Brexit will produce a drag on U.K. GDP of 1.2% in 2017 and 1% in 2018. For the eurozone, we don\u2019t expect the recovery will stall, but estimate a 0.8% hit to GDP over 2017 and 2018. We assume the Bank of England will slash its policy rate to zero by the very end of 2016 and restart its quantitative easing program in 2017, despite a pickup in inflation caused by the weaker pound. European stock markets are fairly flat this morning, as traders look to central banks to do more.... International companies with large overseas earnings are leading the stock market risers in London this morning. That\u2019s because they will benefit from the weak pound; it will make exports more competitive, and mean any dollars earned abroad are worth more when converted back to sterling. But British housebuilders are under pressure, as fears of a Brexit-induced recession swirl. In an encouraging sign for the eurozone, the number of people out of work in Spain has fallen to its lowest levels since September 2009. The jobless total fell by 124,349 people in June, according to new data, the second largest drop on record. This pulled the number of unemployed people down to 3,767,054, the lowest since September 2009. Seasonal factors will have played a big part, as the tourism season is now underway. More here. The British pound has crept a little higher this morning, up 0.2% to $1.3283. That\u2019s still around 9% lower than its pre-referendum levels, due to the historic plunge once the UK voted to leave the EU. The weakening pound is a big factor behind the FTSE 100\u2019s rally, as it makes UK shares more attractive to US investors. The FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK companies than the FTSE 100, has dropped by 0.5% this morning. It\u2019s being dragged down by shipping firm Clarkson, which has plunged by 22% after issuing a profit warning. It blamed \u2018global economic uncertainty\u2019, and the oversupply in the shipping industry. The FTSE 100 has hit a new 10-month high at the start of trading. London\u2019s blue-chip index has jumped by 32 points, or 0.3%, to 6612. That\u2019s the highest level since late last August, before stock markets were gripped by worries over China\u2019s economy. It\u2019s important to note that the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling; the slump in the pound means the index is still worth less than 2 weeks ago. Mining stocks are leading the rally in London, with silver miner Fresnillo jumping by 7%. Royal Bank of Scotland, though, is among the fallers again -- losing 2.2p to 167p. The government\u2019s break-even point of 502p, where it could sell the taxpayers stake at a profit, is getting further away..... Asian stock markets have made a decent start to the week. Shares are higher from Toyko to Delhi, as investors shake off their fears about Brexit. Mizuho Bank says investors are expecting the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, to keep monetary policy extra-loose: \u201cProspects that central banks (BoE and ECB) will unleash fresh stimulus in coming months are providing some relief in markets.\u201d \u201cIt is also perceived that the Fed [US Federal Reserve] will either delay its rate hike to Q3/Q4 or no hike policy rate at all this year.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s 10 day since Britain voted to leave the European Union. Back then, amid the resignations, recriminations and celebrations, there were fears that the London stock markets might crash. But instead, the FTSE 100 has been bouncing back - and could hit a new 10-month high this morning [measured in sterling, anyway]. Once again, central bankers have managed to calm the crisis (for the moment...). Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s promise last week of fresh stimulus measure - such as interest rate cut - is still cheering investors. Chinese policymakers are also expected to act soon, after factory data last Friday showed its manufacturing sector softening again. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says investors will be looking to central banks to do more. Today is almost certainly going to remain about the continued fallout from Brexit as we move into the second full week, further digesting and re-pricing for the new financial, economic and political landscape, the latter being the most entertaining if you are watching the chaos and antics over in Westminster. Any more hints from central banks about stimulus could also help keep the ball in the air, helping markets shrug off the Brexit impact and push on with their recoverie Monetary policy has its limits of course, it might buy us some time but it won\u2019t fix the problems in the global economy. The consequences of Brexit will dominate the political world too. Conservative MPs are racing to choose a new prime minister, while Labour are stuck in their own leadership tussle. And in a new wounding blow to irony, Leave campaigner Boris Johnson is cross that no-one\u2019s written a plan to handle Brexit: Also coming up today.... There\u2019s some economic data this morning, which may show the impact of EU referendum uncertainty. The latest report on the UK construction sector at 9.30am BST, Sentix releases its eurozone investor confidence report at 10am BST. LSE shareholders are voting on whether to approve the takeover by Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank. But it could be a quiet afternoon, as America is celebrating Independence Day.",

The risk is of a run; if buyers fear they will lose access to their money, they will rush to withdraw their savings, triggering the event they dread. Property mutual funds have a liquidity mismatch; savers can withdraw their money every day but property takes months to sell. Funds tend to run with high levels of cash in order to meet this eventuality; Aberdeen says its fund has a cash level of 18% of assets. But Standard Life clearly felt it had to take action.</p> <p>Regulators worried last year about the possibility of systemic risk in the mutual fund sector, although then their concern was about corporate bonds, rather than property. The good news is that this is not like the money market fund crisis of 2008; few people will be keeping their spare cash in a property fund and most will realise that they can lose, as well as make, money.

Property does offer diversification, and a reasonable yield compared to government bonds, but investors must be willing to accept high costs, and a lack of liquidity when the market turns down.</p> <p>Closed-ended property funds at least provide investors the chance to sell out during market upheaval, though widespread selling serves to depress share prices and widen discounts in times of stress. Indeed there are currently a number of closed-ended property trusts trading at discount in excess of 10%. However, being closed-ended does at least means the manager does not have to liquidate properties at a time when everyone else is looking to do the same.</p> <p>Given the outflows the sector seems to be experiencing, this could well put downward pressure on commercial property prices. The risk is this creates a vicious circle, and prompts more investors to dump property, until such time as sentiment stabilises.</p> <p>Continued low interest rates in theory provide support for commercial property, because as prices fall, yields become even more attractive. However at the moment, investors appear to be leaving the sector, rather than buying in.\u2019</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-577a9710e4b0243071e32c0a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-04T17:05:26.267Z\">6.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>City experts are tweeting their concern about Standard Life\u2019s decision to suspend trading in its real estate fund:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dsquareddigest/status/750004360076206081\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, FTSE100 down 0.8%, 250 down 2%.

      "bodyText": "The Brexit vote is a setback for the government\u2019s attempts to sell off its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, the chief executive of the bailed-out bank said on Monday. As the chancellor, George Osborne, prepared to meet with the heads of the major banks to discuss the impact of the EU referendum result on Tuesday, Ross McEwan said the prospects of selling off the majority of the stake had been pushed back by a couple of years. The remarks by the RBS chief executive on LBC radio prompted calls for the government to review its policy for the bank, which received a \u00a345bn taxpayer rescue in 2008 and 2009. Shares in the bank have fallen more than 30% since Britain voted to leave the EU and the share closed on Monday at 167p, well below the 502p average price at which taxpayers bought their stake in the bank. McEwan said that while it was up to the government to sell its stake, \u201cthis will be quite a setback, let\u2019s be honest\u201d. Asked how much longer the sale would take, McEwan said: \u201cI think at least a couple of years \u2013 we\u2019ll be pushed back because of it. But you know markets turn round and go positive as quickly as they go negative.\u201d Osborne said last year that he wanted to reduce the stake in RBS from 73% \u2013 after selling off a five percentage point stake in August for a \u00a31bn loss \u2013 to 25% during the lifetime of the parliament. Such an ambition now looks unlikely and McEwan told LBC the bank had been \u201cknocked around by interest rates being lower for longer, therefore investors are saying, well your returns aren\u2019t going to be as good\u201d. Osborne told MPs that he would be meeting bank bosses to discuss the economy, as economists cut back their forecasts for economic growth. The acknowledgement by McEwan that the share sale could be delayed, sparked campaigners for banking reform to call for a rethink. Christine Berry, senior economy &amp; finance researcher at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cTurning [RBS] into a network of local public savings banks could help boost real economy lending while investing in communities that have been left behind by our London-centric economic model \u2013 exactly the kinds of communities who voted to Leave. RBS is a public asset that could and should be used to rebalance the UK economy.\u201d McEwan, a New Zealander, was asked about how RBS would react in the event of a second Scottish referendum. He said the bank \u201csort of\u201d already had two headquarters in Edinburgh and London. \u201cWe would have to move the plaque,\u201d said McEwan.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If it was bad behaviour, everyone working at Barclays investment bank offices on both sides of the Atlantic were in the know, according to the most senior banker yet to be convicted of plotting to manipulate Libor interests rates. From the witness box, Jay Merchant, a former Barclays bank employee, had insisted that he \u201cfound it difficult to believe\u201d his bosses had not known that all banks making submissions as part of the daily process of setting Libor behaved in a self-interested manner. \u201cEverybody knew the banks set Libor to their own commercial interests,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was completely open from the day I joined [the trading desk].\u201d However, he claimed, that did not mean there was a plot at Barclays to fix the rate: \u201cWe were just doing our job,\u201d he said. James Hines QC, for the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), showed the jury a catalogue of emails that made clear Merchant and his fellow conspirators knew they were acting dishonestly. He explained that the conspiracy ran from 2005 to 2007 and concerned dollar Libor, an important financial industry benchmark used to price a wide range of loans and derivatives. The London interbank offered rate (Libor) is supposed to reflect an average interest rate at which banks, including Barclays, lend to one another. It was set each day based on submissions from a group of major banks. By 2012, however, published Libor rates stretching back many years were discredited after regulators found that Barclays and other banks had sought to manipulate the figure. Since then, this deception has led to a string of fines against some of the world\u2019s largest banks running into billions of dollars. There have also been criminal prosecutions of individual bankers around the world \u2013 several of them British \u2013 with more expected. Two of those involved in the Merchant-led conspiracy at Barclays \u2013 New York-based Alex Pabon and Jonathan Mathew in London \u2013 had only been in their mid 20s when the plotting began. Their lawyers argued they had been naive and intimidated. They said Mathew was dyslexic, partially deaf and had left school with a D and two E grades at A-level. He had only got a job at Barclays because of a family connection, they said. Mathew told the jury it had never crossed his mind that he was doing anything wrong in the way he made Libor rate submissions, insisting that he was acting as Peter Johnson had taught him. Johnson, who is almost 30 years his senior, had already pleaded guilty to his role in the rate-fixing conspiracy. Mathew told how his boss had called him a \u201cdeaf git\u201d and, in one email, a \u201cbick drain\u201d \u2013 a spoonerism designed to get around the bank\u2019s offensive language email filter. On one occasion, Mathew explained, Johnson had struck him with a small baseball bat because he had not known that Manila was the capital of the Philippines. Mathew recalled: \u201cHe [Johnson] had a 12-inch baseball bat on his desk and he whacked me across the back of the head and knuckles ... It wasn\u2019t particularly hard. It was designed to humiliate me.\u201d He had been made to stand on his chair, in the middle of the bank\u2019s trading floor, and face questions on capital cities. But prosecutors rejected claims that any of the plotters were naive or unaware their actions were deceitful. \u201cThe defendants in this case are all very successful, intelligent, well-educated and experienced professionals,\u201d said Hines. \u201cThese men were trusted by Barclays bank to trade in deals worth billions of dollars.\u201d Even Mathew, with few academic qualifications, had proved himself a highly adept banker, rising to be Barclays\u2019 lead manager of dollar cash dealings by 2010, earning more than \u00a3250,000 a year. Email evidence made plain that Merchant and his fellow plotters had known they were acting dishonestly, conspiring to create Libor rate submissions that were intentionally skewed to favour the traders\u2019 own derivative positions. One message read: \u201cWe just need to f****** smash it. Have him set it low.\u201d On another occasion, Merchant stated which rate he wanted: \u201c4.48 fixing [...or] I will get slaughtered.\u201d The convictions for three former Barclays traders and a guilty plea from a fourth come four years after the bank was fined \u00a3290m by US and UK regulators for attempting to manipulate Libor rates. There has been no admission of criminal liability from the bank, but the scandal ultimately led to the departure of the chief executive Bob Diamond, chairman Marcus Agius and other senior bank bosses. In its damning 2012 ruling, the UK\u2019s Financial Services Authority (FSA), now known as the Financial Conduct Authority, found the bank\u2019s misconduct had been \u201cserious, widespread and extended over a number of years\u201d. The case was immediately taken on by the SFO for criminal investigation. Since then, investigators have been looking into two separate alleged Libor-fixing plots at Barclays \u2013 in addition to the conspiracy for which Merchant and his colleagues have been convicted. Last November, one line of inquiry led to charges being brought against 11 former bankers for an alleged plot to manipulate Euribor, the benchmark interest rate for euro-denominated loans. Of the 11, four are former Barclays employees. Another question the SFO is looking into is whether Barclays attempted to manipulated Libor during the financial crisis of 2007-9. No charges have yet been brought in relation to this inquiry, but regulators from the FSA found in 2012 that some bank staff had received instructions to make false submissions to the Libor-setting process during this crisis period. This, they concluded, was in response to fears at the top of the bank about the media using Barclays\u2019 Libor submission figures to speculate that the bank was in financial trouble. The FSA found that \u201cthe origin of these instructions is unclear\u201d. It remains to be seen whether the SFO can discover more. The SFO had initially been reluctant \u2013 under different leadership \u2013 to bring Libor prosecutions, believing the complex facts of such cases were poorly suited to trial before a jury. That decision was reversed in 2012 by the current SFO director, David Green, and the agency received additional Treasury funding to pursue its Libor-fixing inquiries.",

No charges have yet been brought in relation to this inquiry, but regulators from the FSA found in 2012 that some bank staff had received instructions to make false submissions to the Libor-setting process during this crisis period. </p> <p>This, they concluded, was in response to fears at the top of the bank about the media using Barclays\u2019 Libor submission figures to speculate that the bank was in financial trouble.<br><br>The FSA found that \u201cthe origin of these instructions is unclear\u201d. It remains to be seen whether the SFO can discover more.<br></p> <p>The SFO had initially been reluctant \u2013 under different leadership \u2013 to bring Libor prosecutions, believing the complex facts of such cases were poorly suited to trial before a jury. That decision was reversed in 2012 by the current SFO director, David Green, and the agency received additional Treasury funding to pursue its Libor-fixing inquiries.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Investors in Standard Life\u2019s property funds have been told that they cannot withdraw their money, after the firm acted to stop a rush of withdrawals following the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU. The firm halted trading on its Standard Life Investments UK Real Estate Fund and associated funds at midday on Monday, citing \u201cexceptional market circumstances\u201d for the decision. It said the suspension would remain in place until it is \u201cpracticable\u201d to lift it, and that it would review the decision at least every 28 days. The \u00a32.9bn fund, which invests in commercial properties including shopping centres, warehouses and offices, is thought to be the first UK property fund to suspend trading since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when some of the biggest names in investment management stopped withdrawals because they did not have the money to repay investors. Standard Life\u2019s decision is the latest in a line of moves by investment firms to stem flows out of their property funds. Standard Life last week, together with rivals Henderson, Aberdeen and M&amp;G, reduced the amount investors cashing in holdings would get back by up to 5%. In a statement, Standard Life said the decision followed an increase in redemption requests from investors. \u201cThe suspension was requested to protect the interests of all investors in the fund and to avoid compromising investment returns from the range, mix and quality of assets within the portfolio,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe selling process for real estate can be lengthy as the fund manager needs to offer assets for sale, find prospective buyers, secure the best price and complete the legal transaction. Unless this selling process is controlled, there is a risk that the fund manager will not achieve the best deal for investors in the fund, including those who intend to remain invested over the medium to long term.\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was the first property fund suspension since the financial downturn as far as he was aware. \u201cProperty funds are clearly under pressure as a result of the Brexit vote, and we could now see a new wave of investors being unable to liquidate their property funds quickly, which we last witnessed during the financial crisis,\u201d he said. Khalaf said he would not rule out other funds taking the same decision. \u201cIf Standard Life are experiencing outflows it would appear likely that the others are too and they may need to deal with that. We may be seeing more activity like this.\u201d Funds investing in property had been proving popular with investors looking for better returns than cash or bonds. Those who put money into the Standard Life fund five years ago have seen the value of their investment grow by more than 20%, although since the beginning of the year the fund has fallen by almost 8%. Across the sector, there were signs that investors were starting to get nervous before the 23 June vote. Earlier this year, several funds tweaked pricing to make withdrawals less attractive, paying a \u201cbid\u201d price rather than the usual, higher, \u201coffer\u201d price. Data from the Investment Association showed retail investors withdrew \u00a3360m from property funds in May \u2013 the month before the referendum \u2013 although equity funds experienced bigger outflows, with \u00a3439m. Hargreaves Lansdown showed that of the 39 fund sectors available, UK companies and property were the least popular in the week since the referendum. Adrian Lowcock, head of investing at AXA Wealth, said the suspension brought back into focus the issues with investing in open-ended commercial property funds. \u201cDuring the financial crisis many investors were stuck in funds which had closed to redemptions as liquidity dried up,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, whilst there is a short-term issue with the asset class, I do not think this will lead to long-term closure of property funds as it is driven by asset allocation decisions not by investors needing access to money.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse said the terms of their merger would withstand Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, after LSE shareholders voted almost unanimously in favour of the deal. At a meeting in London, 99.89% of LSE shareholder votes were cast for the company to be acquired by Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Shareholders were expected to support the deal but it has faced growing opposition in Germany since the UK vote for Brexit in the 23 June referendum. Before the vote, LSE and Deutsche B\u00f6rse established a referendum committee to examine problems created by a Brexit vote. Announcing its shareholders\u2019 vote for the merger on Monday, LSE said the committee would work to ensure the combined company met all regulatory requirements. Because the UK is likely to stay in the EU for at least two years it may take many months to complete that work, LSE said. LSE added: \u201cThe parties emphasise that the agreed transaction includes all necessary mechanisms to respond to the outcome of the referendum. Whether the UK is just European or a member of the EU, the merger will create a globally competitive, industry-defining market infrastructure group at the service of European industry.\u201d About 50 shareholders gathered at the low-key meeting, held at the London offices of Freshfields, LSE\u2019s legal advisers. Two asked questions. Dinesh Jain, an individual shareholder, asked why, now Britain was leaving the EU, \u201cdo we want to shackle ourselves to a corpse\u201d, Reuters reported. LSE should scrap the merger, which Germany was likely to veto, and instead do deals with exchanges in Asia and Latin America, he said. Donald Brydon, LSE\u2019s chairman, stuck by the deal and said other countries such as France were looking to take business away from LSE. \u201cThere are some people already seeking to pick over the bones of the UK very, very rapidly indeed. Everyone would be wise to take things a step at a time in this area,\u201d Brydon said. The referendum committee will respond to developments in Britain\u2019s negotiations with the EU but the main terms of the deal will remain intact and could only be changed by further shareholder votes once approved. The holding company for the combined group will have its main listing in London but will also be traded in Frankfurt and the company will be regulated in the UK. Carsten Kengeter, Deutsche Borse\u2019s chief executive, will run the company. The exchanges announced a \u00a321bn deal in February to create a European powerhouse of trading in stocks, bonds and complex financial instruments to take on rivals in the US and Asia. It is the third time the companies have attempted a merger after failed attempts in 2000 and 2005. Before the referendum, both companies claimed the merger was Brexit-proof. But following the vote, German politicians and regulators have criticised the deal and called for revisions to the terms or for it to be scrapped. Germany\u2019s markets regulator BaFin said last week the plan to base the combined company in London would not work if the UK was outside the EU. BaFin said it was difficult to imagine the most important exchange in the eurozone being run from outside the EU. BaFin cannot veto the deal but Deutsche B\u00f6rse will face pressure to respond to the regulator\u2019s concerns along with the German state of Hesse, where the company is based and which has a veto power. Several German politicians called for the combined company\u2019s base to be in Frankfurt, while Thorsten Sch\u00e4fer-G\u00fcmbel, a leading Social Democratic party politician, said the deal was dead. Joachim Faber, Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cI strongly endorse the statement of London Stock Exchange Group following their general meeting today and continue to recommend the transaction to the shareholders of Deutsche B\u00f6rse.\u201d With questions hanging over the City of London\u2019s status as the EU\u2019s undisputed financial centre, politicians in other countries are eyeing opportunities to attract banks and other financial companies to base their operations there. LSE and Deutsche B\u00f6rse said after the referendum result was announced that the merger remained on course and that the rationale behind it was intact. LSE shares fell more than 15% in the two days after the referendum result was announced but have recovered some of their losses. The shares closed down just over 1% at \u00a324.93 on Monday. Deutsche B\u00f6rse shareholders will vote in a postal ballot and have until 12 July to swap their shares for those of the new company.",

That\u2019s the message from private sector housebuilders, which have looked into the industry\u2019s crystal ball and concluded that there is no reason to expand supply for the next six months. The Markit/Cips survey of construction companies was disturbingly clear in the picture it presented of a sector badly damaged by the EU referendum. Empty plots waiting for the digger to turn up and foundations to be laid look likely to stay that way, at least until the Brexit dust has settled, and maybe even longer, if the doom-mongers who predicted a big drop in house prices prove correct. As the former head of the civil service Lord Turnbull said last week, the industry is extremely sensitive to economic sentiment and will not build a single house more than it believes can be sold. He blamed this sensitivity on the 2008 financial crisis, saying the industry remains deeply scarred by those events. The latest evidence goes to support his main point \u2013 that the industry is unable to build the homes that the nation needs, where it needs them and at a reasonable price. The House of Lords economic affairs committee, of which Turnbull is a member, is due to publish a report on the housing sector imminently. He said it had become clear to members that local authorities and housing associations must play a much bigger role after years of cutbacks. The public sector has to be a steady supplier of homes, much as it was during the 1950s under the Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan governments. To most people in the housing industry, this was obvious for years. Labour, under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, attempted to bully private housebuilders into including social housing in their estates. But it was always an uphill task. Tony Pidgley, the chairman of Berkeley Group, who pocketed a 42% rise in his take home pay to \u00a323m last year, could not close the supply gap even if he wanted to. He needs to make a profit for his hungry shareholders, who have set him a target of generating \u00a32bn in pretax profit over three years from 2015, as reservations fall by 20%. Social housing is a discreet element of the Berkeley mix, but like most other major housebuilders, it cannot be more than that. Turnbull makes no judgment on private developers, other than to highlight the empirically irrefutable point that they never build more than 120,000-130,000 homes a year in a country that, even if net migration were brought down to the tens of thousands, would require at least 200,000 new homes a year. Fathom Consulting is one of the economic consultancies that continue to make this point year after year. It argues that property suffers from a market failure, which must be tackled by the government. Let\u2019s hope that the Lords makes the same point.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has ditched its joint venture with the low-cost retailer Netto, putting up to 400 jobs at risk and marking the Danish chain\u2019s second exit from the UK in six years. Netto\u2019s 16 UK stores, all in the north of England, will close in August, just over two years after Sainsbury\u2019s launched its \u00a325m partnership with Dansk Supermarked Group. The British supermarket said it would make a \u00a320m writedown on Netto\u2019s assets and spend \u00a310m on winding down the business. About 400 people are employed in the joint venture, 100 of those in head office positions that could be redeployed to either Sainsbury\u2019s or Dansk. Up to 300 jobs in stores may go. Sainsbury\u2019s exit from the venture comes as it prepares to complete its \u00a31.4bn takeover of Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos, a move which is likely to take up considerable management and financial resources. Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, said: \u201cTo be successful over the long-term, Netto would need to grow at pace and scale, requiring significant investment and the rapid expansion of the store estate in a challenging property market. Consequently, we have made the difficult decision not to pursue the opportunity further and instead focus on our core business and on the opportunities we will have following our proposed acquisition of Home Retail Group.\u201d He said the grocery market had \u201cevolved significantly\u201d since Sainsbury\u2019s first envisaged its joint venture with Netto almost three years ago. Coupe said: \u201cNetto is an excellent retailer with talented leaders and colleagues and we have learnt a great deal about the discount grocery retail market from this trial venture.\u201d But the breakup of Dansk\u2019s 50-50 joint venture with Sainsbury\u2019s marks the failure of Netto\u2019s second attempt to crack the UK market. Its previous attempt ended in 2010 when Dansk sold its 200 UK outlets to Asda. The group has more than 400 stores in its home market, as well as outlets in Germany, Poland and Sweden. Sainsbury\u2019s has never revealed details of Netto\u2019s trading performance in the UK but the group has struggled to find appropriate sites amid heavy competition from fast-expanding rivals Aldi and Lidl. Per Bank, chief executive of Dansk Supermarked said: \u201cWhilst we are pleased with the performance of the stores to date, it has become clear to both partners that the business requires greater scale over a short period of time to achieve long-term success. Reaching scale has been challenging due to appropriate site availability and therefore we decided together to end the joint venture and focus on other opportunities within our respective businesses.\u201d Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at analysis firm Kantar Worldpanel, said Netto\u2019s relatively small size meant it could not match the economies of scale which have helped underpin the success of rival discounters Aldi and Lidl. \u201cAldi and Lidl have each had a rapid programme of new store openings matched with huge advertising and marketing spend to keep themselves front and centre in consumers\u2019 minds. Despite a 20-year history predating this joint venture, Netto lacks this brand awareness and credibility in its latest incarnation, and any retailer looking to learn from this experiment should note that this isn\u2019t something which can be achieved without significant investment,\u201d McKevitt said.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cOutsourcing Creates Jobs in the Long Run\u201d. That was the title of a blog written by Donald Trump for his students at the now defunct Trump University. You see, long before Trump made speeches this week in Pennsylvania and Ohio decrying the consequences of unfair trade deals, he was the head cheerleader and a major beneficiary of the policies that have battered America\u2019s manufacturing base for decades. If you want to know Trump\u2019s true position on the current corporate trade model, all you have to do is follow the money. Trump has consistently sent American jobs overseas to line his own pockets. He personally profited from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Most of his suits, ties and cufflinks are made in China. His dress shirts are made in Bangladesh. His furniture is made in Turkey. Trump talks a good game on trade, but his first and only loyalty is to himself. He embodies everything that is wrong with our current trade policies, from which CEOs thrive and everyday families suffer. And how about the occasions when he kept his business in America? Time and again, working people got stiffed. Trump has literally failed to pay hundreds of people and companies who have faithfully done work for him. And it\u2019s not just now and then, or long ago. In April, he didn\u2019t pay servers at a Passover event who worked 20 hours straight. You\u2019ll have to forgive our skepticism that Donald Trump is actually a friend of working people. He said our wages are too high. Really, he did. Trump wants to destroy labor unions. His position on wage-suppressing right-to-work laws is \u201c100%\u201d, and he has routinely moved union jobs to right-to-work states. Trump actually rooted for the collapse of the housing and real estate market. He bet on himself and against America. People lost their homes, their jobs and their life savings. And Donald Trump was cheering all the way to the bank. Hard-working families in Pennsylvania, Ohio and across America are hungry for a new direction on trade. They are sick and tired of policies that destroy jobs and hold down wages. At the AFL-CIO, we are focused on rewriting the trade rules, the structures that for too long have left our communities poorer and weaker. This isn\u2019t a matter of whether or not to trade. It\u2019s about what the rules are and who benefits from them. Of course, we should open up new markets for our products and do business all over the world. The real challenge is to advance trade policy that creates shared prosperity. The pending Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), like Nafta before it, fails that test miserably. Donald Trump\u2019s anti-trade rhetoric amounts to little more than bandwagon bluster and textbook hypocrisy. He knows the TPP is unpopular in the states he needs to win so he pretends to care about lost jobs and shuttered factories. But Trump has always seen working people as nothing more than a means to an end: labor to be exploited, customers to be bilked and human capital to be used and then discarded. We refuse to sit back and be co-opted as a talking point for a profiteer who has traded away our future for his own personal gain. It\u2019s our job to explain that Donald Trump is not the answer to our trade problems \u2013 he is the problem. Richard L Trumka is president of the AFL-CIO, America\u2019s largest union federation",

He personally profited from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Most of his suits, ties and cufflinks are made in China. His dress shirts are made in Bangladesh. His furniture is made in Turkey. Trump talks a good game on trade, but his first and only loyalty is to himself. He embodies everything that is wrong with our current trade policies, from which CEOs thrive and everyday families suffer. </p> <p>And how about the occasions when he kept his business in America? Time and again, working people got stiffed. Trump has literally failed to pay hundreds of people and companies who have faithfully done work for him. And it\u2019s not just now and then, or long ago. In April, he didn\u2019t pay servers at a Passover event who worked <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/\">20 hours straight</a>.</p> <p>You\u2019ll have to forgive our skepticism that Donald Trump is actually a friend of working people. He said our wages are too high. Really, he did. Trump wants to destroy labor unions. His position on wage-suppressing right-to-work laws is \u201c100%\u201d, and he has routinely moved union jobs to right-to-work states. Trump actually rooted for the collapse of the housing and real estate market. He bet on himself and against America. People lost their homes, their jobs and their life savings. And Donald Trump was cheering all the way to the bank.</p> <p>Hard-working families in Pennsylvania, Ohio and across America are hungry for a new direction on trade. They are sick and tired of policies that destroy jobs and hold down wages. At the AFL-CIO, we are focused on rewriting the trade rules, the structures that for too long have left our communities poorer and weaker.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/14/afl-cio-chief-richard-trumka-interview-trans-pacific-partnership-hillary-clinton\">Richard Trumka, AFL-CIO's combative president: 'We still punch far above our weight'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This isn\u2019t a matter of whether or not to trade. It\u2019s about what the rules are and who benefits from them. Of course, we should open up new markets for our products and do business all over the world. The real challenge is to advance trade policy that creates shared prosperity. The pending Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), like Nafta before it, fails that test miserably.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s anti-trade rhetoric amounts to little more than bandwagon bluster and textbook hypocrisy. He knows the TPP is unpopular in the states he needs to win so he pretends to care about lost jobs and shuttered factories. But Trump has always seen working people as nothing more than a means to an end: labor to be exploited, customers to be bilked and human capital to be used and then discarded. We refuse to sit back and be co-opted as a talking point for a profiteer who has traded away our future for his own personal gain. It\u2019s our job to explain that Donald Trump is not the answer to our trade problems \u2013 he is the problem.</p> <ul> <li><em>Richard L Trumka is president of the AFL-CIO, America\u2019s largest union federation</em></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Clarkson, the world\u2019s biggest shipbroker, lost a fifth of their value after it warned that weak global trade would cause a large fall in annual profit. In an unscheduled trading update, Clarkson said the rates it could charge for shipping freight fell sharply in the first half of the year because of global economic uncertainty and a fall-off in trade. The statement did not mention the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. The Baltic dry index, which measures shipping rates, has dropped in recent months and came close to record lows in the first quarter of the year, Clarkson said. The group warned at its annual general meeting last month that trading was difficult and it has deteriorated further since. Clarkson said: \u201cWhilst recent strengthening of the US dollar against sterling, if sustained, will offer some limited enhancement to reported profits, the board nevertheless now anticipates \u2026 profits for 2016 will be materially lower than the full year 2015.\u201d The company\u2019s main activity is arranging for businesses to charter ships to transport their goods. It also helps shipping companies raise finance and provides research and support services such as logistics and equipment. Broking transactions have increased but freight rates and the value of ships have fallen, reducing activity in Clarkson\u2019s financial division. The company said its business was resilient with a strong pipeline of financial business and a strong balance sheet. Clarkson shares fell as much as 23% and were down 18% at \u00a318.13 in late morning trading. The shares have fallen by more than a third in the past year as concerns have mounted about the prospects for world trade amid a slowdown in China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of raw materials transported by ship. Colin Smith, an analyst at Clarkson\u2019s house broker Panmure Gordon, cut his forecast for 2016 pretax profit by 21% to \u00a343.1m. Clarkson made \u00a350.5m profit last year. Smith said: \u201cProfits are under pressure, notwithstanding the strength of Clarkson\u2019s underlying business performance. Shipping is a cyclical business, so the timing of recovery is uncertain but we believe it is prudent to assume that it is likely to be delayed into 2017.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK construction industry slumped dramatically in run-up to EU vote", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s builders had their worst performance in seven years last month as a collapse in new orders clobbered firms in the run-up to the EU referendum. One economist described the outlook for the industry as dire after the prospect of a vote to leave the EU sent property investors scurrying for the exit door. Housing market jitters were blamed for much of the fall in activity, which forced housebuilders across the country to down tools and mothball projects. Shares in Britain\u2019s biggest property developers and builders tumbled on Monday as investors digested the bleak implications for revenues and profits of a freeze in new homes being built after the latest batch of projects reaches completion. British Land was the biggest faller, sinking more than 7% to 564p, while Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Berkeley Group Holdings slumped 6%. Berkeley, which made \u00a3531 profits last year and paid its chairman, Tony Pidgley, a 42% pay rise to \u00a323m, recently reported a 20% fall in reservations. Shares began their slide on 24 June immediately after the EU referendum result emerged as it became clear that investors were withdrawing funds designated for new developments. The exodus of funds prompted industry representatives and unions to call on the government to step in and bolstered infrastructure spending and support for new homes. The Markit survey is the first to show that a broad slowdown has turned into a rout, knocking hundreds of millions of pounds off the value of major property firms. Indicating that all parts of the industry were being hit, office and factory building was almost as badly hit while business confidence was at its lowest for three years. The Markit Cips construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) tumbled to 46 in June, down from 51.2 in May. It was the first time since April 2013 that it was below the 50 threshold which separates growth from contraction. The speed of the contraction in June took the industry back into recessionary territory but fell short of the frantic tumble in activity last seen in the post-financial crash era in 2009. Markit said the figures were overwhelmingly linked to deteriorating order books that meant firms lacked new work to replace completed projects. \u201cA number of firms commented on reluctance among clients to commence new contracts in the run-up to the EU referendum, alongside ongoing uncertainty about the general economic outlook. Incoming new work has now fallen for two months running, and the latest reduction was the steepest since December 2012,\u201d it said. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThis is an absolutely dire survey that fuels serious concern over the construction sector. \u201cFurthermore, the survey was 80% completed before the UK voted to leave the EU. The survey can only intensify concern as to just how much the construction sector will be hampered by the Brexit vote.\u201d Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: \u201cConstruction firms are at the sharp end of domestic economic uncertainty and jolts to investor sentiment, so trading conditions were always going to be challenging in the run-up to the EU referendum. \u201cHowever, the extent and speed of the downturn in the face of political and economic uncertainty is a clear warning flag for the wider post-Brexit economic outlook.\u201d Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, said there was growing concern that situation would worsen as uncertainty increased. \u201cConstruction is an industry that is particularly vulnerable to dips in confidence and it appears that many clients were hesitant to commit to new projects as they were unsure of what the future held. An exit road map is needed to show what steps are going to be taken to withdraw from the EU.\u201d Berry said dithering by ministers over agreeing to politically charged infrastructure projects was also harming the sector. \u201cPublic investment in our sector could play a vital part in warding off an economic slump.\u201d The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said the sector\u2019s difficulties showed the government needed to press ahead with major infrastructure projects like a third runway at Heathrow, the London to Birmingham high-speed rail link and a big expansion in low-cost housebuilding. \u201cThe Brexit vote is likely to further damage the confidence of investors in the construction sector. The government must respond quickly with an emergency programme of public investment to stop the UK economy taking a nosedive,\u201d she said.",
