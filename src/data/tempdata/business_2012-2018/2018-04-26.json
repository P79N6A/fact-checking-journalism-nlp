      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: The IT crisis at TSB Bank is heading towards its eighth day, as the company continues to struggle to fix problems created by a botched IT migration last weekend. TSB has called in experts from IBM, who are now trying to fix the issues that are still preventing 50% of customers from accessing its internet banking services. CEO Paul Pester has told IBM to find a solution by Saturday - and admitted that the bank is \u2018on its knees\u2019, following the move onto new IT kit from its parent company Sabadell. He said: \u201cWe are on our knees, we will get up, and come back fighting\u201d. Sabadell has predicted that the mess won\u2019t be fixed until next week -- one reader has been told it could take five working days. The bank has begun compensating customers, with a \u00a340 payment to a couple. It has also waived all overdraft fees in April, and pledged to raise the interest rate on its current account from 3% to 5% - worth up to \u00a330 a year to customers. We understand the measures will cost at least \u00a320m. There\u2019s some good news for small businesses - HMRC have said they\u2019ll be understanding if people can\u2019t get into their accounts to make VAT payments. Several readers have told us that they intend to close their accounts, suggesting TSB will suffer long-term damage from the IT fiasco. Some have also expressed support for TSB\u2019s frontline staff, who have been through a very rough week. I may pop back later if there\u2019s big breaking news. Until then, thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight! GW Our latest news story on the TSB crisis is now live. Here\u2019s a flavour: TSB customers have spent their seventh successive day battling to access their accounts as the bank admitted that the crisis could run into next week. The bank\u2019s boss, Paul Pester, said TSB will waive \u00a310m in overdraft fees and pay extra interest on current accounts. He has hired a new team of IT experts from IBM who have been told the problems must be fixed by Saturday. However, Jaime Guardiola, the chief executive of TSB\u2019s Spanish owner, Banco Sabadell, said customers may have to wait until next week before normal service returns. The Guardian has uncovered images on LinkedIn of IT workers in Spain who handled the botched transfer celebrating with sparkling wine and exclaiming \u201cTSB transfer done and dusted!\u201d and \u201cHell of a team!\u201d. The pictures were posted just as the meltdown was beginning, and up to 1.9 million customers were subsequently locked out of their accounts. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, writes that relations between TSB and its Spanish parent company look rather tense this week.... Let\u2019s try to be generous to Paul Pester, TSB\u2019s beleaguered chief executive. His handling of the fallout from the botched IT \u201cupgrade\u201d has been poor \u2013 some of his statements and tweets have been nonsensical, others have been factually wrong \u2013 but it is already clear that the primary blame for the fiasco itself lies in Spain, at the door of Banco Sabadell, TSB\u2019s parent. Nils thinks this may explain Pester\u2019s refusal to rule out taking a bonus this year: He should have made the gesture, but he may be wondering if the internal blame game will end with his exit and the usual contractual wrangles. The head of an overseas subsidiary usually makes a suitable fall guy. More here: Here\u2019s a round-up of stories from TSB customers this week: Paul Pester has told the Daily Telegraph that he doesn\u2019t yet know exactly what has caused this week\u2019s IT meltdown, preventing an army of customers from accessing their accounts online. Asked what the specific issue was, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s why I have got IBM here. \u201cWe have two datacentres, miles of fibre-optic cable and several layers of software. Somewhere among that architecture are issues causing capacity constraints. \u201cWe have a team of experts that will get to the bottom of this.\u201d Richard Brittain, the TSB customer who set off today to close his account (having borrowed the petrol money from a friend), has got back in touch. Richard ended up speaking with TSB\u2019s Kent area manager - and learned that they think it might take another five working days to clear all the technical problems. The area manager was able to \u2018bend\u2019 the withdrawal rules, so Richard could withdraw all his fund and put them in another bank. TSB also managed to trace money that had gone missing from the account since the IT problems began. It sounds like a good effort under the circumstances. As Richard puts it: It was actually refreshing to talk to someone senior enough who could actually deliver solutions, rather than focusing on the problems. I must say, TSB need to not only compensate their customers, but they also need to recognise their staff who have been a real asset. All of the staff I have come across are genuinely sorry and they really are trying their best to help. I have been asked by the area manager to leave the current account open, so that TSB are able to gain my trust back. At the moment, TSB are going to need to work extremely hard to get the public trust back. We can\u2019t change what\u2019s happened, but the way that TSB deals with this issue will be the deciding factor as to whether we\u2019re going to remain with them. TSB has been churning out some alarming error messages this week -- baffling customers with talk of BeanFactories (to do with programming language Java) and NullPointerExemptions ( \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af ). IT expert Simon Needham suspects that the bank\u2019s user authentication processes aren\u2019t scaling properly -- which is why half its internet banking customers aren\u2019t getting into the service. Bradley Post, managing director of Rift Tax Refunds, says TSB customers should certainly pursue the bank for compensation, and tell HMRC of any problems too. Small business using TSB may struggle to pay HMRC due to the recent problems the bank is facing with their IT systems. The good news is that HMRC will take the circumstances into consideration, however, customers need to record the problems they have encountered so they can put a case together and ensure they do not pay more than they should. The bigger issue now is how customer opinion will change for TSB with some people choosing to sort their finances elsewhere. According to Moneysavingexpert.com customers are now receiving compensation. If you are left out of pocket due to these issues you should look to contact TSB immediately\u201d Claire McAdam and Ian Roddie\u2019s \u00a340 compensation is dwarfed by the bills which some small businesses may claim from TSB. For example, tiler Phil Rooney told BBC Hereford and Worcester that the chaos had already cost him thousands as he was unable to pay staff from his account. We\u2019ve had staff walk out on us, sub-contractors, tilers, electricians, because we\u2019re not in a position to be able to pay them by the internet payments that we usually use so it\u2019s cost us so far \u00a32,000 this week.\u201d Moneysavingexpert.com is reporting that the first compensation payments are already going out to customers who have complained. It said Claire McAdam and her partner Ian Roddie from Glasgow have been paid \u00a340 compensation after McAdam was unable to access her bank account online or make a bank transfer from her account to repay money she owed on a credit card. The bank paid McAdam \u00a315 to cover interest charged for delayed payments on her credit card, and a further \u00a325 for inconvenience caused. The \u00a340 was paid into McAdam\u2019s TSB account just before noon on Thursday. If \u2018inconvenience\u2019 payments to affected customers match the \u00a325 paid to McAdam, then TSB is in line for hefty payouts. It has 1.9m online and mobile customers, and if all received the payment the bill would be \u00a347.5m. Broadcast journalist Natalia Crawford of Radio Clyde News has tweeted about the \u201cabsolutely disgraceful\u201d situation which TSB customers such as herself are suffering: Britain\u2019s tax authorities have told us that they will understanding if small businesses cannot make payments to them because of the TSB IT meltdown. Some business owners have warned that they cannot make cash transfers, such as VAT payments, to the authorities because they cannot currently get into their TSB account. Asked about the situation, a HMRC spokesperson says: \u201cHMRC will take the circumstances of TSB customers into account if asked to do so.\u201d So, TSB customers should record evidence that this week\u2019s computer problems prevented them making their scheduled payments. If they have a reasonable excuse, in HMRC\u2019s view, they shouldn\u2019t incur any penalties for late payments - as long as they fix the situation when possible. That might reassure SME owners, such as animator Lee Johnson and entrepreneur George Lamptey, who have both tweeted TSB about the issue today: Just in: Paul Pester has told ITV News that IBM team of experts must fixed TSB\u2019s problem by Saturday. That suggests that the bank expects services to remain disrupted until then, but is perhaps hoping to recover by the start of next week (which chimes with Sabadell\u2019s comments) He\u2019s also continuing to duck questions about his bonus, some of which has been held back until the IT migration was completed.... TSB customer Penny Simpson still cannot log into her account online - despite TSB\u2019s claim that things are running smoothly for the vast majority of customers. She reports that TSB refuses to accept her User ID and password. When she clicks \u2018forgotten User ID\u2019, the bank sends her.... her old log-in details, and says they are now clear to use. So she tries, only to be told they\u2019re incorrect.... Penny\u2019s also unpressed by Paul Pester\u2019s claim that the underlying banking platform is working well - even though half of internet banking customers ares still locked out. This is like saying the kitchen\u2019s cooking up a storm but the restaurant can\u2019t get any food. I\u2019m sick to death of Paul Pester and his shambolic communications. And, most of all, I\u2019m sick of TSB using the word \u2018some\u2019 as if this is a handful of customers. It isn\u2019t; it\u2019s millions. TSB\u2019s Classic Plus pays interest on the first \u00a31,500 of money in the account. So, raising the interest rate on balances from 3% to 5% is actually only worth \u00a330 to a customer per year, or \u00a32.50 per month. Getting back (briefly) to the European Central Bank meeting in Frankfurt.... ECB chief Mario Draghi has warned that global risks such as protectionism have risen - a clear nod to Donald Trump\u2019s trade spat with China. Draghi also point out that European economic growth seems to have moderated broadly recently, with some countries experiencing a loss of momentum. But growth is expected to remain \u201c solid and broad-based\u201d, he adds -- suggesting the ECB isn\u2019t bracing for a recession.... TSB customer Richard Brittain has has enough of TSB - he\u2019s on his way to his local branch to close his account, having borrowed money from a friend to pay for the petrol. He tells me that he\u2019s made 13 calls to TSB, only to be disconnected after waiting for up to two hours. Richard says: I am now going into town to get all my money out. TSB have now told me they need 7 working days to fix my current account. He also has sympathy for TSB\u2019s staff, who have been \u201cliterally in tears\u201d as they\u2019ve handled calls from customers. I don\u2019t think enough is being done to report these issues to TSB. Their number is just constantly engaged, and when you do get through they cut you off after a 2 hour wait in the queue. I have been without access to my bank since Friday... and now we\u2019re being asked to wait even more! Time to move to a better bank! I\u2019m \u00a3400 down at the moment, all because of TSB. Money is in my account and it\u2019s being withheld from me! Just goes to show, you cant believe the news. TSB are telling everyone this issue is fixed, yet it\u2019s far from it. Another 2 hour wait on the phone to get through to someone, to just be told that they\u2019re \u201cworking on it\u201d We are on day seven now, and I\u2019ve had no answer as to when they\u2019ll be fixing my issues. TSB have just asked me for 5 WORKING DAYS to get my current account \u201cun-deleted\u201d and money returned. Meanwhile, the staff are literally in tears on the phone. Its not their fault that their employer decided to screw over two million of us. But, this doesn\u2019t get my bills paid. I honestly don\u2019t know what else I can do. Their phone system is diabolical, I get disconnected after waiting in a queue for 2 hours!! Back to TSB, and Paul Pester has just tweeted a reminder of this morning\u2019s announcement: In other banking news, the European Central Bank has just voted to leave eurozone interest rates unchanged at 0.0%. It also repeated its promise to keep buying government bonds until at least the end of September, or until inflation has risen sustainably close to its target. Several more TSB customers have told us that they intend to close their accounts. David Green, 39, is the owner of a plant and machinery hire company in Birmingham and thinks heads should roll for the mess: \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace. How can I run two businesses with staff and suppliers who require paying from day-to-day? Some suppliers are refusing to serve us services as we cannot pay like we always have done. It\u2019s not their fault, I wouldn\u2019t expect them to, but it\u2019s diabolical that we\u2019ve been left like this. It\u2019s ruined my business week completely. I have staff who think we can\u2019t afford to pay them. We have suppliers who think we are making excuses. I have to keep sending screenshots to people that question me. How embarrassing for a company which will turn over 10 million this year! How can I operate like this? Sackings should happen and the guy at the top needs to join the real world. Just because he doesn\u2019t need to use his bank every day doesn\u2019t mean we are all in the same position as him. I will be closing my business accounts ASAP as I have lost all faith and cannot risk this happening again.\u201d Textile designer, Lucie, 31, says it is very stressful not knowing if her money is safe: \u201cI\u2019ve tried to log in however TSB doesn\u2019t recognise my password! The robotic repetition of apologies and responses on their website are so mind-numbingly bland and unhelpful. I\u2019ve actually just come back from the bank where I tried to pay my rent and it didn\u2019t go through. Their advice was to just: \u201cKeep trying\u201d. As soon as this is over I will be switching my bank. \u201c To say that Lorraine Kelly, 52, from London, is fuming is an understatement, she tells us: \u201cI can honestly say that since the weekend it has been a nightmare. I urgently needed to transfer funds to top up my smart meter (as I\u2019m on prepay) but after 40 minutes on hold to TSB the line was cut. Having no choice I stupidly tried numerous times with the same outcome. In sheer anger I clicked on their status report and the final insult was a message saying that TSB have restricted some selected customers. What the hell? If I ever get to talk to anyone at TSB it will be to close my accounts and transfer all my money.\u201d TSB\u2019s pledge that no customer will be left out of pocket as a result of the fiasco will come with a hefty price tag. The bank estimates that its decision to waive all overdraft fees and interest charges in April, as well as raise the interest rate on its \u2018Classic Plus\u2019 account to 5% from 3%, will cost an estimated \u00a320m. That\u2019s on top of any regulatory fine the bank might face, as well as the (presumably large) bill for drafting in IBM to fix the problems. The Times is reporting that TSB was warned that its IT migration would flounder unless it spent more money. It says: A TSB adviser warned the bank against embarking on a major internet upgrade on the cheap, The Times can reveal. Consultants raised concerns in 2015 that the bank was not setting aside enough money for the \u201cincredibly complex\u201d project to move customers to a new online system. One said: \u201cThere have certainly been some examples of where it has cost significantly more to re-platform an entire bank. It is not overly generous as a budget for that scale of migration.\u201d Parent company Sabadell reported this morning that it set aside \u20ac71m in one-off IT costs to cover the TSB migration. That\u2019s roughly twice what UBS analysts had expected....but clearly it wasn\u2019t enough! Radio 5 Live have uploaded their interview with Paul Pester, in which he admits TSB is on its knees and promised to compensate customers from losses suffered through this week\u2019s mess. TSB\u2019s efforts to placate its customers by waiving overdraft fees and boosting its current account interest rate has come too late for some customers. Mark Ellison tells us that he\u2019s moving his account to Metro Bank \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d, as he had previously worked for TSB for five years. He\u2019s also filed a complaint over this week\u2019s disruption. IBM\u2019s team of experts have no time to waste -- TSB customers are continuing to report problems with their accounts. TSB\u2019s Spanish parent company has warned that services might not be back to normal until sometime next week! Jaime Guardiola, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, told analysts this morning that the migration onto its IT kit (from TSB\u2019s previous owner, Lloyds) had been problematic: \u201cFixing the problem took more time than expected and we were not able to reopen access until Wednesday. I expect next week we will reach something very close to normality,\u201d This is quite a u-turn. On Monday, Sabadell announced that the weekend migration was a success, only to quietly remove that press release the next day..... Guardiola also reiterated TSB\u2019s pledge to compensate customers, adding: \u201cWe will make sure that no customer is left out of pocket and we are asking customers to file complaints that will be processed. Waiving overdraft fees is a good start, but it won\u2019t tackle all the losses suffered by TSB customers this week. People could be hit by late fees, for example, if they fail to meet credit card bills or other loan repayments. Clea Bourne, lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London, says the whole financial sector should show some understanding . The decision to call in IBM tech experts to tackle TSB\u2019s IT problems suggests that the problem is bigger than the company realised and may take several days to fix. Remember, at 3.40am yesterday Paul Pester was confidently tweeting that things were \u2018up and running\u2019 again -- something that is going to haunt TSB chief for a while. Now he actually has to make it happen, declaring: \u201cI will take direct control from 8 o\u2019clock this morning for our platform, I\u2019ve drafted in a team of global experts from IBM. They are reporting to me, directly to me and I will take control of the platform until it gets fixed. I am putting things right.\u201d Q: Were you warned last week that you weren\u2019t ready for this IT migration? We were ready for the platform switch, CEO Paul Pester insists. TSB expected some turbulence, but no-one expected the issues that have hit the bank since the weekend. Q: Have you considered resigning? I haven\u2019t even had time to think about it, Pester replies. That\u2019s the end of the Radio 5 interview. Paul Pester is now being grilled on Radio 5 Live over TSB\u2019s IT mayhem. Q: Why didn\u2019t you give more information to customers, and claim that everything was fixed when it wasn\u2019t? Pester says that the fundamentals of the bank, such as standing orders, direct debits, ATM machines, are working well. The problem is with capacity -- handling the number of customers who want to use internet and mobile banking services. Q: Why did you tweet that TSB\u2019s services were \u2018up and running\u2019 , when for many customers it clearly wasn\u2019t? Pester says TSB\u2019s IT provider (parent company Sabadell) told him it was fixed. Clearly that wasn\u2019t the case. However, he\u2019s now taken personal control - a team of experts from IBM will land at Bristol at 8am his morning, and start to tackle the problem. It\u2019s unacceptable that only 50% of customers can access our internet banking, declares Pester. Q: Isn\u2019t it also unacceptable that you didn\u2019t have control of your customer\u2019s accounts over the weekend? Pester ducks the question; instead, he plugs the decision to waive overdraft fees and raise the interest rate on the Classic Plus current account for current customers who \u201cstick with us\u201d. This is a fight worth fighting. TSB was created to bring more competition into UK banking. Q: Will customers be properly compensated? No customer will be left out of pocket, Pester pledges. We won\u2019t be penny-pinching. Small businesses who have suffered losses because they haven\u2019t been able to pay suppliers or contractors should get in touch. Asked whether he would be giving up a potential \u00a31.6m bonus, Pester told BBC Radio 4 that it was a matter for the company: \u201cThe last thing I\u2019m worried about at the moment is bonuses and pay. I\u2019m focused on putting things right for customers. It\u2019s not my decision, that\u2019s a focus for them [the board]. It\u2019s a decision for the remuneration committee.\u201d Speaking on Radio 4, Paul Pester says he has taken control of TSB\u2019s IT platform himself - to tackle the problems that mean only 50% of its customers can get online. NEWSFLASH: TSB has announced that it will waive all overdraft fees and interest charges for retail customers and small business owners for April, as it tries to assuage the anger over its IT meltdown this week. After days of turmoil, TSB has also decided to raise the interest rate on its popular \u2018Classic Plus\u2019 account to 5% (a very decent interest rate these days), from 3% -- an attempt to prevent customers fleeing to a rival. In a statement, it says: No TSB customer will be left out of pocket as a result of these issues \u2013 to begin to put this right we will be waiving all overdraft fees and interest charges for all of our retail and small business customers for April. As a way of saying thank you to our customers for sticking with us, we\u2019ll be increasing the interest rate on our Classic Plus account to 5% AER. CEO Paul Pester admits that TSB\u2019s migration to new servers last weekend had been very unsatisfactory. He says: As we moved over to our new banking platform last weekend, the landing was an incredibly bumpy one for our customers, and for that I am truly sorry. This is not the level of service that we pride ourselves on providing \u2013 nor is it what our customers have come to expect from TSB.... \u201cOf course, customers can rest assured that no one will be left out of pocket as a result of these problems. To begin to put things right, we will be waiving all overdraft fees and interest charges for all of our retail and small business customers for April. TSB also reveals they they\u2019ve called experts from IBM in to help fix the problems with its internet banking. In the meantime, customers still report problems: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. One of Britain\u2019s worst IT botches of recent years continues to rumble on today. TSB customers are still reporting that they can\u2019t access the bank\u2019s online systems, nearly a week after they were taken down for a planned IT migration. Last night, TSB admitted that its internet banking service is only running at 50% capacity - which helps explain why scores of users have been locked out. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank is meeting to set monetary policy. Investor will hope for hints about how the ECB will handle its money-printing stimulus programme, which currently runs until September. In the markets, European stocks are expected to nudge higher after Facebook posted record earning figures last night, suggesting its data privacy problems haven\u2019t hurt profitability.

      "bodyText": "TSB customers have spent their seventh successive day battling to access their accounts as the bank admitted the crisis could run into next week. The bank\u2019s boss, Paul Pester, said TSB will waive \u00a310m in overdraft fees and pay extra interest on current accounts. He has hired a new team of IT experts from IBM who have been told the problems must be fixed by Saturday. However, Jaime Guardiola, the chief executive of TSB\u2019s Spanish owner, Banco Sabadell, said customers may have to wait until next week before normal service returns. \u201cWe are on our knees,\u201d Pester admitted in a BBC Radio 5 Live interview, adding: \u201cWe will get up and come back fighting.\u201d The Guardian has uncovered images on LinkedIn of IT workers in Spain who handled the botched transfer celebrating with sparkling wine and exclaiming \u201cTSB transfer done and dusted!\u201d and \u201cHell of a team!\u201d. The pictures were posted just as the meltdown was beginning, and up to 1.9 million customers were subsequently locked out of their accounts. More than a day after Pester declared: \u201cOur internet banking and mobile app are back up and running\u201d, around 50% of TSB online customers were still struggling to access their accounts. Many reported hour-long waits to speak to TSB staff on the phone, while some of those able to get through online said passwords failed and they remained unable to complete transactions. Customers heading into TSB branches were told by some staff that it could be another five working days to completely clear all the technical faults. The cause of the IT problems remains unclear. A spokeswoman for TSB said: \u201cIt\u2019s really a bandwidth issue that we\u2019re facing. On the mobile app, nine in 10 customers are getting through to us. On internet banking, one in two customers are getting through to us. The phones are certainly busier than usual but people are getting through.\u201d In a bid to prevent a mass exodus of customers, TSB said: \u201cWe will be waiving all overdraft fees and interest charges for all of our retail and small business customers for April. As a way of saying thank you to our customers for sticking with us, we\u2019ll be increasing the interest rate on our Classic Plus account to 5% AER.\u201d But Pester rejected calls to resign or forgo his bonus, telling BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cI haven\u2019t even had time to think about it.\u201d A rift has emerged between TSB in the UK and its parent company in Spain. The IT project, involving the transfer of 1.3bn customer records from TSB\u2019s previous owner Lloyds, was managed from Spain, and Pester said he was told the issues were fixed, when they evidently were not. He said he had taken personal control, with a team of experts from IBM arriving in Bristol yesterday morning to tackle the problem. TSB had claimed before the botched transfer that switching customer records would save more than \u00a3100m a year. \u201cA new, state-of-the-art platform designed and built with Sabadell ... will reduce TSB\u2019s costs considerably,\u201d Pester said last year \u2013 but the bank now faces a ballooning compensation bill. The first payouts to disgruntled customers have already begun. Two customers in Glasgow, Claire McAdam and Ian Roddie, were paid \u00a340 after they were unable to access their TSB accounts to pay money owed on a separate credit card. Moneysavingexpert.com said the bank paid McAdam \u00a315 to cover interest charged for delayed payments on her credit card and a further \u00a325 for inconvenience caused. If inconvenience payments to affected customers match the \u00a325 paid to McAdam, the final bill will runs into the tens of millions. A TSB spokeswoman said: \u201cWe will look into every query we receive. We\u2019re also going through every tweet we see and [are] reaching out to customers.\u201d The Financial Conduct Authority has sent a team into TSB to monitor and assess the situation, while the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said it was continuing to investigate the issue. HM Revenue &amp; Customs said it would be understanding if small businesses cannot make payments because of the TSB IT meltdown. Some business owners have warned that they cannot make cash transfers, such as VAT payments, because they cannot currently access their TSB accounts. An HMRC spokesperson said: \u201cHMRC will take the circumstances of TSB customers into account if asked to do so.\u201d The chaos at TSB has knocked nearly 10% off the share price at Sabadell since the start of the week, even though the bank reported first-quarter profits up 33% to \u20ac259.3m (\u00a3225.5m) on Wednesday.",

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s try to be generous to Paul Pester, TSB\u2019s beleaguered chief executive. His handling of the fallout from the botched IT \u201cupgrade\u201d has been poor \u2013 some of his statements and tweets have been nonsensical, others have been factually wrong \u2013 but it is already clear that the primary blame for the fiasco itself lies in Spain, at the door of Banco Sabadell, TSB\u2019s parent. When Pester said on Thursday that he would take personal control of the crisis, many customers will have wondered why the boss wasn\u2019t in charge already. The answer is that the platform switch was being managed from Spain by Sabadell, albeit with help from TSB\u2019s offices in Bristol and London. The arrangement made sense in theory. TSB is adopting Sabadell\u2019s in-house Proteo platform and the parent claimed to be a wizard in the art of migrating data. Pester\u2019s announcement that, on assuming control, he\u2019d hired a crack team from IBM to fly in to Bristol therefore amounted to an expression of little confidence in his Spanish bosses. Note, too, his explanation of why he had tweeted that TSB\u2019s services were \u201cup and running\u201d when they were not. Pester said he\u2019d been assured by the IT provider \u2013 meaning Sabadell \u2013 that all was well. He should have checked the information himself, but relations between parent and subsidiary do not sound good. The mood probably won\u2019t improve as overworked TSB staff see pictures of Sabadell contractors drinking sparkling wine on Monday to celebrate the \u201csuccess\u201d of the data transfer. Nor will tensions ease, one suspects, as the bills rise. Over in Spain, Sabadell unveiled an additional \u20ac77m (\u00a367m) charge related to its TSB project, which may indicate the IT challenge has been steeper than anybody has previously cared to admit. Pester\u2019s giveaways \u2013 no overdraft fees for a month and a better interest rate on the main current account \u2013 will cost another \u00a320m-plus. IBM\u2019s emergency crew won\u2019t come cheap either, and there\u2019s a likely financial whack from UK regulators to come. In the circumstances, you can understand why Pester dodged questions about whether he\u2019d accept a bonus this year. He should have made the gesture, but he may be wondering if the internal blame game will end with his exit and the usual contractual wrangles. The head of an overseas subsidiary usually makes a suitable fall guy. Banking advisers get another payday in Nex takeover There has rightly been outrage over the advisory fees racked up by GKN as it tried, unsuccessfully, to defend itself against Melrose\u2019s hostile bid \u2013 a cool \u00a3107m, including a ridiculous \u00a327m dispatched to advisers acting for Dana, the US firm that wanted to buy GKN\u2019s automotive division. But here\u2019s a deal where the bankers\u2019 bonanza looks even more extreme. Nex Group, Michael Spencer\u2019s financial technology outfit, has somehow found itself on the hook for \u00a345.4m as it is bought by Chicago-based CME Group for \u00a33.9bn. Formal documentation shows the lion\u2019s share of \u00a337.9m is ear-marked for \u201cfinancial and corporate broking advice\u201d \u2013 meaning the services of investment bankers at Citigroup, Evercore and Goldman Sachs. Yes, Nex\u2019s bill is slightly less than half GKN\u2019s, but consider the differences. The UK engineering firm was fighting a hostile bid over a 60-day timetable. Nex is doing a smaller friendly deal that involved no extended scrapping in public. Indeed, the way Terry Duffy, the boss at CME tells the tale, the tricky part of the negotiation was conducted one-on-one with Spencer before the talks became public. How on earth, then, do Nex and CME, which itself clocked up \u00a321.9m on financial advice (principally from Barclays and JP Morgan), justify the sums? There is no explanation, of course. It\u2019s just what the City and Wall Street has been able to demand from compliant clients. Directors convince themselves this is the inevitable price of doing business and, in non-hostile takeover bids, nobody makes a fuss. They really should. In total, the two sets of banking advisers in the Nex/CME alliance are collecting almost \u00a360m. At a rough guess, that covers the work of about 20 principal individuals in a negotiation where there was goodwill on both sides and the heavy all-night sessions were probably compressed into a fortnight. The sums are absurd. BP chair is no stranger to pay rows Just what BP needs as its new chairman \u2013 an expert in boardroom pay rows. Unfortunately, Helge Lund is used to being the target of revolting shareholders. His \u00a325m signing-on package at BG Group caused a stink in 2015. It wasn\u2019t his fault, of course, that BG\u2019s board wanted to shower him with incentives, or that Shell soon made a takeover bid that crystallised his windfall. But the Norwegian Lund makes an unlikely figure to police BP\u2019s traditional excess.",

His handling of the fallout from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/25/tsb-customers-share-experiences-it-crisis\">botched IT \u201cupgrade\u201d</a> has been poor \u2013 some of his statements and tweets have been nonsensical, others have been factually wrong \u2013 but it is already clear that the primary blame for the fiasco itself lies in Spain, at the door of Banco Sabadell, TSB\u2019s parent.</p> \n<p>When Pester said on Thursday that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/26/tsb-drafts-in-ibm-team-to-end-it-meltdown\">take personal control</a> of the crisis, many customers will have wondered why the boss wasn\u2019t in charge already. The answer is that the platform switch was being managed from Spain by Sabadell, albeit with help from TSB\u2019s offices in Bristol and London. The arrangement made sense in theory. TSB is adopting Sabadell\u2019s in-house Proteo platform and the parent claimed to be a wizard in the art of migrating data.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"39972d38-079a-4e73-9f36-74e1ca8fcaac\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>We\u2019d like to hear from those who have encountered issues with their online account.

Note, too, his explanation of why he had tweeted that TSB\u2019s services were \u201cup and running\u201d when they were not. Pester said he\u2019d been assured by the IT provider \u2013 meaning Sabadell \u2013 that all was well. He should have checked the information himself, but relations between parent and subsidiary do not sound good.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/26/tsb-drafts-in-ibm-team-to-end-it-meltdown\">TSB crisis could drag into next week as bank turns to IBM</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The mood probably won\u2019t improve as overworked TSB staff see pictures of Sabadell contractors drinking sparkling wine on Monday to celebrate the \u201csuccess\u201d of the data transfer. Nor will tensions ease, one suspects, as the bills rise. Over in Spain, Sabadell unveiled an additional \u20ac77m (\u00a367m) charge related to its TSB project, which may indicate the IT challenge has been steeper than anybody has previously cared to admit. Pester\u2019s giveaways \u2013 no overdraft fees for a month and a better interest rate on the main current account \u2013 will cost another \u00a320m-plus. IBM\u2019s emergency crew won\u2019t come cheap either, and there\u2019s a likely financial whack from UK regulators to come.</p> \n<p>In the circumstances, you can understand why Pester dodged questions about whether he\u2019d accept a bonus this year. He should have made the gesture, but he may be wondering if the internal blame game will end with his exit and the usual contractual wrangles. The head of an overseas subsidiary usually makes a suitable fall guy.</p> \n<h2>Banking advisers get another payday in Nex takeover</h2> \n<p>There has rightly been outrage over the advisory fees racked up by GKN as it tried, unsuccessfully, to defend itself against Melrose\u2019s hostile bid \u2013 a cool \u00a3107m, including a ridiculous \u00a327m dispatched to advisers acting for Dana, the US firm that wanted to buy GKN\u2019s automotive division.</p> \n<p>But here\u2019s a deal where the bankers\u2019 bonanza looks even more extreme. Nex Group, Michael Spencer\u2019s financial technology outfit, has somehow found itself on the hook for \u00a345.4m as it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/29/michael-spencer-nex-takeover-cme-group\">bought by Chicago-based CME Group for \u00a33.9bn</a>. Formal documentation shows the lion\u2019s share of \u00a337.9m is ear-marked for \u201cfinancial and corporate broking advice\u201d \u2013 meaning the services of investment bankers at Citigroup, Evercore and Goldman Sachs.</p> \n<p>Yes, Nex\u2019s bill is slightly less than half GKN\u2019s, but consider the differences. The UK engineering firm was fighting a hostile bid over a 60-day timetable. Nex is doing a smaller friendly deal that involved no extended scrapping in public. Indeed, the way Terry Duffy, the boss at CME tells the tale, the tricky part of the negotiation was conducted one-on-one with Spencer before the talks became public.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>How on earth, then, do Nex and CME, which itself clocked up \u00a321.9m on financial advice (principally from Barclays and JP Morgan), justify the sums? There is no explanation, of course. It\u2019s just what the City and Wall Street has been able to demand from compliant clients. Directors convince themselves this is the inevitable price of doing business and, in non-hostile takeover bids, nobody makes a fuss.</p> \n<p>They really should. In total, the two sets of banking advisers in the Nex/CME alliance are collecting almost \u00a360m. At a rough guess, that covers the work of about 20 principal individuals in a negotiation where there was goodwill on both sides and the heavy all-night sessions were probably compressed into a fortnight. The sums are absurd.</p> \n<h2>BP chair is no stranger to pay rows</h2> \n<p>Just what BP needs as its new chairman \u2013 an expert in boardroom pay rows. Unfortunately, Helge Lund is used to being the target of revolting shareholders. His \u00a325m signing-on package at BG Group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/05/bg-group-shareholders-rebel-against-helge-lund-pay-deal\">caused a stink</a> in 2015. It wasn\u2019t his fault, of course, that BG\u2019s board wanted to shower him with incentives, or that Shell soon made a takeover bid that crystallised his windfall. But the Norwegian Lund makes an unlikely figure to police BP\u2019s traditional excess.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The high street has been rocked by a fresh wave of store closures and job losses as household names including Carpetright, Fenwick and Poundworld announced major restructuring programmes. At a meeting in London on Thursday, Carpetright was able to avoid tipping into administration after landlords backed a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) that will allow it to close 92 stores with the loss of 300 jobs. Struggling retailers, including New Look and Toys R Us, have turned to the insolvency procedure to shed loss-making stores and negotiate cheaper rents on other outlets. No sooner was the ink dry on Carpetright\u2019s plan than it emerged that the struggling discount retailer Poundworld wants to use a CVA to shed 100 stores, a move that will cause up to 1,500 job losses. Poundworld, which started in 1974 as a market stall in Wakefield in West Yorkshire, has expanded to become a chain of 355 stores with 5,500 employees. Poundworld was acquired by the American private equity firm TPG Capital in a \u00a3150m deal in 2015. However, it has struggled in the wake of the Brexit blow to sterling that pushed up the cost of imported goods. Last month, TPG used a CVA to close nearly 100 branches of its ailing restaurant chain Prezzo. Hopes of a high street recovery from trading hit by poor weather were dashed after the CBI reported another weak month of sales for retailers. In its monthly distributive trades survey, the CBI said 31% of firms had reported a sales growth over the year to April; 33% reported a fall. The balance of -2% points was much weaker than the +16% point rise anticipated when retailers were questioned last month. The tough trading conditions faced by retailers in March were underlined by the experience of Homebase, where sales plummeted 20% as the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d cold weather added to the woes of the Australian-owned DIY chain. High-end retailers are not immune; Robbie Feather, the chief executive of upmarket department store chain Fenwick, warned that a \u201csignificant number\u201d of its 2,200 jobs were at risk as part of a plan to modernise the 136-year old family business. \u201cThese proposals are part of a broader strategy to modernise the business and to invest in Fenwick\u2019s multichannel offer and its flagship Newcastle store [which is getting a \u00a330m refit],\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are consulting all colleagues about proposed structural changes and it is only at the end of this process that we can confirm how many posts will be made redundant.\u201d After winning the backing of landlords, Carpetright will begin talking to shareholders as it looks to raise \u00a360m to reduce debt and cover the cost of the restructuring. \u201cLandlords have taken the view that a recapitalised market leader is better than no market leader,\u201d its chief executive, Wilf Walsh, said after the creditor meeting. \u201cThe 25-year leases, with upward only rent reviews, signed in the 90s and noughties have run out of road.\u201d",

Sources at the firms, two of the big six energy suppliers, had expected the merger to get the go-ahead from the Competition and Markets Authority.

Unless the firms can address concerns by 3 May, the CMA will embark on a second stage of its investigation, a process that could take about six months.

      "bodyText": "Hopes in the high street of a bounce back from poor weather-affected trading have been dashed after the CBI reported another weak month of sales for retailers. The employers\u2019 organisation blamed the squeeze on consumer incomes and structural change in the sector for a fifth successive month of disappointing sales. In its monthly distributive trades survey, the CBI said 31% of firms had reported sales growth over the year to April; 33% reported a fall. The balance of -2% points was much weaker than the +16% point rise anticipated when retailers were questioned last month. The 100 retailers that took part in the survey were again upbeat about their trading prospects. A balance of +25% points said they expected business in May to be brisker than in the same month of 2017. Recent official data has been in line with the gloomy findings from the CBI. Retail sales fell by 1.2% between February and March, according to the Office for National Statistics. Anna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the CBI, said: \u201cSales have continued to disappoint in April, after falling in March. But expectations for next month are looking a little healthier. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that UK high streets have endured tough trading conditions in recent months, with some big names closing or cutting back. Much of this reflects ongoing structural changes in the sector as well as the continued squeeze on households\u2019 real incomes. \u201cWhile conditions have improved for households recently \u2013 with real wage growth inching into positive territory \u2013 we expect further gains in living standards to remain modest. So the pressure looks set to stay on retailers for the time being.\u201d The CBI said there had been falls in clothing, footwear and leather, and furniture and carpets \u2013 but these had been offset by sales growth among grocers, hardware and DIY, and recreational goods stores. The CBI survey was conducted between 28 March and 13 April, before the mini heatwave that may have increased demand for summer clothes and shoes.",

Poundworld\u2019s decision to seek a deal with its landlords, first reported by Sky News, follows a similar move by Carpetright. Its creditors were due on Thursday afternoon to vote on the potential closure of about 90 stores.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The IT meltdown at TSB may not be fully fixed until next week, the bank warned on Thursday, as it drafted in experts from IBM to help solve the crisis that has left up to 1.9 million customers locked out of their accounts for almost a week. The chief executive, Paul Pester, said on Thursday he was \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for the botched systems upgrade, which has affected mobile and internet banking customers, but refused to say whether he would give up a potential \u00a31.6m bonus. He admitted there were still problems with TSB\u2019s internet banking and mobile app, seven days after the bank started moving millions of customer accounts to a new platform built by its Spanish owner, Banco Sabadell. Jaime Guardiola, Sabadell\u2019s chief executive, said the difficulties might continue into next week. He told analysts: \u201cFixing the problem took more time than expected and we were not able to reopen access until Wednesday. I expect next week we will reach something very close to normality.\u201d Pester insisted that no customer would be left out of pocket because of the chaos. The bank will waive all overdraft fees and interest charges for its retail and small business customers for April. It will also raise the interest paid out on its standard current account to 5% on balances up to \u00a31,500, up from 3%, for existing customers who stick with the bank. TSB has estimated that it will cost about \u00a320m to waive the fees and charges, and to raise the interest rate on its most popular account. \u201cAs we moved over to our new banking platform last weekend, the landing was an incredibly bumpy one for our customers, and for that I am truly sorry,\u201d Pester said. \u201cOur teams continue to work around the clock to fix the problems that some of our customers are having in accessing their TSB accounts. I want to reassure our customers that the engine room of the bank is working as it should.\u201d On Thursday morning, about half of all customers trying to access their accounts through the TSB website were still unable to do so. One customer said he still could not log on to his account and was concerned about a VAT payment he was due to make to HMRC. Another said that because she could not access her account to make payments, her daughter lost her place on a school trip. Britain\u2019s tax authority said it would be reasonable about late payments from small businesses, as long as they could provide evidence that it was because of TSB\u2019s IT glitch. \u201cHMRC will take the circumstances of TSB customers into account if asked to do so,\u201d a spokesman said. Asked whether he would take personal responsibility for the chaos, Pester said he had been \u201ctoo busy to think about\u201d resigning. On the subject of whether or not he deserved a bonus after the fiasco, he said it would be a matter for the bank. \u201cThe last thing I\u2019m worried about at the moment is bonuses and pay. I\u2019m focused on putting things right for customers. It\u2019s not my decision, that\u2019s a focus for [the board]. It\u2019s a decision for the remuneration committee.\u201d Under the bank\u2019s current plans, Pester could potentially be paid a bonus of up to \u00a31.6m for 2017. However, the remuneration committee stated in TSB\u2019s annual report that the decision on the bonus would be delayed \u201cuntil migration and integration have been successfully completed in 2018\u201d. The crisis began on Friday, when TSB started a planned migration of 5 million customers and 1.3bn records from its previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group, to a platform built by Sabadell. Customers were told the job would be completed by 6pm on Sunday. However, it soon became apparent something had gone badly wrong, with customers unable to log into their accounts or access funds. Some small businesses have been unable to pay staff or complete transactions, while other customers have reported having their cards declined. Pester said that from 8am on Thursday he was taking over direct responsibility for the IT infrastructure from Sabadell. The IBM team will report directly to Pester. The chief executive has been heavily criticised for misleading customers after tweeting on Wednesday morning that services were \u201cback up and running\u201d when there were still widespread problems. Pester said he was determined TSB would get back on it feet and continue to be a challenger bank to its bigger high street rivals such as Lloyds and HSBC. \u201cThe way we deal with every single one of our frustrated customers as quickly as possible will define TSB \u2013 both now and in 10, in 15 and in 20 years to come as we continue on our mission to bring more competition to UK banking.\u201d The IT debacle is likely to prove costly for TSB, which potentially faces a multimillion-pound compensation bill and regulatory fines, and the loss of customers. Ignacio Cerezo, an analyst at UBS covering Sabadell\u2019s first quarter results on Thursday, said a one-off IT cost of \u20ac71m for TSB \u201cwas higher than our \u20ac30-40m estimate\u201d.",

Perth-based Wesfarmers said the cold snap had played havoc with demand for plants and garden furniture, resulting in a fresh setback for the struggling chain. The dire March trading meant like-for-like sales in the first three months of 2018 were down 15.4% on the same period last year \u2013 even worse than the 15.1% decline posted in the previous quarter. Wesfarmers had planned to convert the chain into an outpost of its successful domestic chain Bunnings, which, in Australia at least, is famous for low prices and sausage sizzles. So far only 23 of Homebase\u2019s 250 stores have been converted to the Australian brand and it is unclear whether the group will continue with the costly refurbishments. Earlier this year the Wesfarmers managing director, Rob Scott, said the conglomerate was considering pulling out of the UK after what has been billed as one of the most disastrous retail takeovers ever seen. In February, Scott said the group was writing off A$1bn (\u00a3543m) after bungling the 2016 takeover. Wesfarmers bought Homebase for \u00a3340m two years ago but it is now understood to be considering offering more than \u00a3100m to find a buyer. Another option would be to pursue a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency procedure being used by New Look and Carpetright to dump loss-making stores. The collapse in Homebase sales has in part been self-inflicted after the original Australian management team axed senior managers and key departments, including home furnishings, which had appealed to British shoppers. The former B&amp;Q executive Damian McGloughlin has been drafted in to run the chain.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from October 2006 to May 2011 This month\u2019s data will feed into the MPC\u2019s May decision \u2013 whether to increase the official interest rate above 0.5% for the first time since March 2009. The MPC has passed up many opportunities to embark on this process since 2014. We have missed the opportunity to follow the lead of the US Federal Reserve, which has been gradually pushing up its key lending rate since the end of 2015. That policy has not dampened US growth to any significant extent, and it is likely the Fed will push its benchmark interest rate above 2% by the end of this year. Mark Carney has cited Brexit uncertainty as a reason for delaying a rate rise next month, and his statements have had a negative impact on the value of the pound. But Brexit uncertainty has been with us since before the referendum vote. It should not continue to be used as a reason to delay rate rises which are fully justified by other economic fundamentals. The economic data shows unemployment has fallen to a new low since the mid-1970s. Wage growth is picking up and pay increases now exceed the rate of inflation. Economic growth in the first quarter is likely to be affected by the bad weather in February and March, so it will not be a reliable indicator for judging the overall health of the economy. Meanwhile, the world economy is booming. The IMF has upgraded its forecasts for global growth again, and the period 2017-20 is set to be its strongest period since before the financial crisis. Both the global economy and the UK will enter the 10th year of economic recovery this summer \u2013 so the current economic expansion is already quite mature. Brexit has already had, and will continue to have, a negative impact on the UK economy. But it cannot be the only factor driving economic policy. The budget deficit has come down to around 2% of GDP, giving the UK more scope for using fiscal policy to support growth. A rise to above 0.5% is long overdue, and postponing it again will not help the UK economy. David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, US, and member of the MPC from June 2006 to May 2009 When retailers are struggling, inflation is on the way down, GDP growth is weak and house prices in London are falling, it is difficult to see why the Bank of England is considering raising rates. The lack of wage pressure has proved a particular problem for policymakers, who continue to expect nominal annual wage growth to revert to pre-recession averages of 4% or higher, and real wage growth nearer to 2%. Single-month figures from the Office for National Statistics for total pay, including bonuses, have shown a decline in the last three months from 3.1% to 2.8% and 2.3% in the latest estimate for February. It\u2019s true that the three months average preferred by the ONS showed weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.8% from the same period a year ago, but this higher average is largely due to mathematical effects. When Carney and the MPC deliberate on whether to raise rates, they must recognise that employers have not reacted to low unemployment by increasing pay. Why? Because productivity growth has been flat. Despite recent increases, low productivity workers have disproportionately been hired. Flat productivity has led to flat wage growth. Pay settlements have continued to suggest a norm over the last several years of around 2%. So to raise interest rates, Threadneedle Street must produce a forecast that says wages will rocket over the next two years. It might manage to produce a fantasy figure. After all, in February 2018, the MPC was forecasting wage growth of 3% in 2018, 3.25% in 2019 and 3.5% in 2020, which seems unlikely. However, its forecasting record is appalling and a repeat would most likely be wrong. With the economy this weak, I would vote for a rate cut, not a rise.",

      "bodyText": "Sterling retreats after Carney comments The pound soared earlier in the month amid speculation over an interest rate rise from the Bank of England in May, but sterling has staged a sharp retreat since Mark Carney hinted of a delay following recent weak economic data. Sterling had climbed back above $1.43 for the first time since January after the ONS declared the return of real wage growth \u2013 seen as a key prompt for higher interest rates. However, the governor pointed to bad economic news from heavy snowfall and weak retail sales, sending the pound back below $1.40. Sterling remains about 6% less valuable versus the dollar than before the 2016 referendum. FTSE 100 rises as pound weakens What\u2019s bad for the pound is good for the FTSE 100 because many of the companies in the index make substantial profits in dollars and export around the globe. The weak pound, which is a boon for these firms, has helped the index of bluechip British shares rise by almost 400 points over the past month. Fears over a potential trade war between China and the US rattled markets earlier in the month but a softer tone from Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has placated investors. Better than expected UK inflation falls to lowest level for a year Inflation unexpectedly fell in March, the clearest indication yet of the EU referendum result\u2019s fading effects on the cost of living in Britain. Growth in prices accelerated sharply last year, triggered by the weak pound after the Brexit vote pushed up the cost of imports. That has now begun to fade, with inflation sliding to 2.5% last month from 2.7% a month earlier. The outcome was lower than forecast, despite speculation that the reading could have been influenced by one-off factors \u2013 such as the lack of a budget in March, which usually drives up the cost of fuel and tobacco in the spring. Better than expected Trade deficit shrinks amid global fears The spectre of a damaging global trade war triggered by Donald Trump could dent the ambition of leading Brexiters to strike free trade deals with the rest of the world after the UK leaves the EU. For now, despite the warning signs, there was better news last month in the narrowing UK trade deficit. The trade deficit highlights the difference between what Britain sells abroad and what it imports. In February, this narrowed to \u00a310.2bn, down from \u00a312.2bn in January. Worse than expected \u2018Beast from the east\u2019 causes drop in activity There were signs that the freezing weather and heavy snow early last month brought the UK economy to a standstill, raising questions over whether the Bank of England would raise interest rates in May. Barometers of business activity in the construction and services sectors fell sharply, with the latter recording the worst month for activity since the Brexit vote. The IHS Markit/CIPS all sector purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to 52.1, down from 54.2 on a gauge where a reading of 50 splits the difference between expansion and contraction. As a result, economists are forecasting a fall in economic growth for the first quarter of 2018 by about half from the final months of last year. Better than expected Unemployment falls, but wage growth stalls The big news was the return of real wage growth after a year of negative earnings after inflation for British workers, when the ONS said average pay was once again outstripping price growth. Unemployment also unexpectedly fell to the lowest level since 1975, sliding to 4.2% in the three months to February from 4.3% in the three months to January. However, the return of real wage growth was down to falling inflation, rather than rising pay. Against forecasts for an increase of 3%, average weekly earnings including bonuses rose by 2.8%, at the same level as January. Worse than expected Retail sales feel unseasonal chill March\u2019s bad weather may seem like a distant memory, but the scars still show on retailers\u2019 profit and loss accounts. Freezing temperatures sent shoppers scuttling from the nation\u2019s high streets and clobbered sales. Volume of sales fell 1.2% in March from February, with petrol sales especially hard hit, down 7.4%, said the Office for National Statistics. Sales were down 0.5% between January and March compared with the previous quarter, the worst performance in a year. Better than expected Government borrowing at lowest level since 2007 Philip Hammond received good news from the public finances last month, with figures showing the UK budget deficit had narrowed to the lowest annual level since the financial crisis. According to the ONS, public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, fell by \u00a33.5bn to \u00a342.6bn in the last financial year \u2013 making 2017-18 the best year for the budget deficit since the year ending March 2007. The shortfall between how much the government spends and what it receives from taxes was \u00a32.6bn lower than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Meanwhile, the chancellor had hinted during the spring statement he could raise spending in the autumn budget should the public finances remain on track. Worse than expected House price growth slows amid uncertainty Brexit uncertainty is weighing heavily on the UK property market, where house price growth has slowed across the country and in reverse in London. The latest snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) showed demand from buyers fell for the 12th consecutive month in March, coupled with the seventh month in a row for fewer new instructions from sellers. Meanwhile, official figures from the ONS showed the first annual fall for house prices in London since the depths of the last recession in 2009. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month ... Britain needs more migrants to offset an ageing population Net migration has fallen since the Brexit vote as EU workers choose to return home or decide against coming to Britain. But while that might cheer some Brexit voters, company bosses are growing increasingly concerned about potential staff shortages, which could act as a drag on the economy. The dangers were underlined by new analysis from the International Monetary Fund this month, warning that major economies face being overwhelmed by ageing populations. Calling on the world\u2019s biggest nations to throw open their doors in response, the IMF said adults of working age would need to support twice the number of elderly people as at present within the next few decades. That would put immense pressure on welfare systems and wipe out as much as 3% of potential economic output by 2050.",

      "bodyText": "The British economy is showing signs of faltering as the Bank of England considers raising interest rates, although falling inflation has handed households better news, according to a Guardian analysis of economic developments over the past month. As the Bank debates raising the cost of borrowing above 0.5% for the first time since the depths of the last recession, the Guardian\u2019s latest Brexit dashboard paints a mixed picture. Freezing weather and heavy snow appear to have blown the already-fragile economy off course, as the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d forced shoppers to stay home and diggers and cranes to lay idle across the country. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, pointed to weak retail sales and the squeeze on the high street among \u201cmixed economic data\u201d over the past month that could delay a rate hike. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in four cases the outcome was better than expected. The latest dashboard shows rising real earnings for the first time in a year, helping to ease the pressure on squeezed households, as the inflationary effects from the sudden drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote begin to fade. There was also an unexpected further fall in the unemployment rate to the lowest level since 1975. The Office for National Statistics declared the return of real wage growth, pointing to average pay packets rising above inflation by 0.2% in the three months to February. Meanwhile, there was good news for consumers facing spending constraints as the consumer price index (CPI) unexpectedly dropped to the lowest level in a year in March, falling to 2.5% from 2.7% in February. Scrapping the spring budget this year may have flattered the CPI reading, given the usual raid on smokers and drinkers by the chancellor which usually pushes up the cost of living around this time of year. However, economists said wages rising above inflation could help to boost high street spending later this year. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said this stronger economic data should encourage the Bank to raise interest rates. \u201cA rise to above 0.5% is long overdue, and postponing it again will not help the UK economy,\u201d he said. But there are also worrying signals from the economy as Theresa May prepares for a Commons showdown over plans to leave the customs union, which business leaders warn could wreak further damage. Figures suggesting a slight drop in output for the wider European economy appear to have been matched in the UK, where heavy snowfall in late February and early March made matters worse. The IHS Markit/CIPS barometers of business activity in the construction and services sectors fell sharply last month, with the latter recording the worst month for activity since the Brexit vote. The latest estimates from economists at the EY Item Club point to output falling by as much as half in the first three months of 2018, while the forecasters reckon the UK economy \u201ccontinues to display a lack of momentum and shows little sign of breaking the pattern of uninspiring growth seen over the course of last year\u201d. Fresh from its spring meetings last week, the International Monetary Fund ranks the UK at the bottom of the European growth league alongside Italy. The fund also said tighter controls on immigration could damage the world\u2019s most advanced economies, which it said risked being overwhelmed by their ageing populations and should open their borders in response. Net immigration has been falling since the EU referendum and there are fears among business leaders over labour shortages ahead. Meanwhile, the news from the property market over the past month showed stuttering growth in house prices across the UK, shrouded in gloom by Brexit uncertainty, with official figures recording the first annual drop in London house prices since 2009.",

    "webTitle": "TSB crisis: customers count cost of IT meltdown as problems continue - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our latest news story on the TSB IT crisis: In theory, TSB customers have another hour to call the bank for help before customer services closes for the day, at 11pm. In practice, there\u2019s a long queue, and no certainty of getting through eventually.... Radio producer Amanda Redman is just one of many customers to report that TSB is giving her inaccurate information when she logs in: This whole IT migration fiasco is a setback for TSB\u2019s attempts to challenge Britain\u2019s larger banks, says the Financial Times tonight. The FT adds: A person briefed on the TSB board\u2019s plans insisted the platform had not been rushed out, and said questions over who was responsible would have to wait until the system was running smoothly for all its customers: \u201cGiven the testing they didn\u2019t think this was where they were going to end up \u2014 they never would have pushed the button otherwise,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting a bit better but there\u2019s still some way to go . . . we\u2019ve got to get to a point where things are stable, the backlogs are cleared, and then we can start an inquest.\u201d TSB is facing more criticism from MPs tonight, over its failure to migrate smoothly onto a new IT system. Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake told the Daily Telegraph: It doesn\u2019t seem sensible that TSB took a big bang approach to this switch. This is simply not acceptable. If they\u2019re going to do an upgrade they should have been prepared and have contingencies in place. This is like when KFC ran out of chicken.\u201d And still they come.... TSB customers are still reporting a litany of problems tonight: TSB has now revealed that its internet banking service is only running at 50% capacity. It admits that half of the customers who try to get onto its internet banking system are still facing issues - despite CEO Paul Pester announcing 16 hours ago that things were up and running. TSB also says its mobile app is now operating at 90% capacity, meaning one in 10 users are suffering problems. Pester also conceded that customers still aren\u2019t getting a good enough experience. In a curious statement - he says that \u2018everything is working\u2019, but not in a way that customers can see (!!). The challenge we are facing at the moment is that while we know everything is working, one of the main ways that our customers see everything is working \u2013 through our internet banking and mobile app \u2013 isn\u2019t functioning as well as it should be, and for this I\u2019m truly sorry,\u201d he added. \u201cI can appreciate how frustrating this must be for our customers.\u201d Penny Simpson has got back in touch, to report that she still can\u2019t log into TSB\u2019s internet banking service. She adds: Can we not dispel the myth that the online system is working, because if you have to spend hours everyday attempting to get in, then it isn\u2019t working. TBS insists that things are running smoothly for the \u2018vast majority\u2019 of customers. Some, though, are still experiencing problems - such as Andy Sharps of Shropshire. He says TSB\u2019s site crashed this afternoon as he tried to withdraw his money: TBS say they\u2019re \u2018working around the clock\u2019 to put things right: TSB also warns that some customers are experiencing a delay in receiving text alerts, or may not receive them at all. It\u2019s also taking longer than usual to isssue replacement debit and credit cards. Both these problems might not be fixed until the end of April. Despite CEO Paul Pester claiming that TSB\u2019s internet banking is \u201cUp and running\u201d, some services are still in the \u201cdown and out\u201d category. According to TSB\u2019s service status page, there are still several problems. For example, internet and mobile banking customers still can\u2019t view their mortgages online (which explains why some people found their loans had vanished this morning) Business banking customers are seeing errors when they try to reset their log-in details, and some also can\u2019t see their standing orders in their banking app. Neil De Silva, a DJ and part-time model from Glasgow was unable to pay for additional luggage because he couldn\u2019t get his TSB card to work, leaving him stranded in Thailand: \u201cI ended up missing my flight to Singapore after my card was declined. Things then went from bad to worse as I couldn\u2019t log into my bank account to transfer some savings to pay for a new flight.\u201d Stacey and Louie Brown, who have recently been married in Thailand, had to borrow money from weddings guests to cover their costs. \u201cMy husband\u2019s card was blocked but luckily we had friends and family with us who we borrowed from to pay for food and accommodation. We would have been sleeping on the beach otherwise,\u201d says 31-year-old Stacey from Dorset, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to sign up to a divemaster course as part of our honeymoon, but now the internet banking is down we can\u2019t transfer any money. We\u2019re now living on water and toasties and down to our last \u00a340. Hopefully we will have access to our money again soon.\u201d This is similar to the case of Matt, covered earlier in the blog. TSB\u2019s online banking system still looks like a lottery, 11 hours after CEO Paul Pester tweeted that it was working again. Some customers, such as PA Liza Young, have managed to overcome its problems.... ..but others, such as historian Guy Walters, are still frustrated. Breaking away from TSB briefly, UK housebuilder Persimmon is being given a bloody nose by shareholders. Investors at its AGM are angry at \u201ctotally and utterly unjustifiable\u201d multi-million bonuses paid to its chief executive and senior managers, including a \u00a375m award for CEO Jeff Fairburn. Around 64% of shareholders refused to back the package - either by abstaining or voting against it. Euan Stirling, head of stewardship at Aberdeen Standard Investments, one of Persimmon\u2019s biggest shareholders with a 2.3% stake, said the \u201cenormous sums\u201d due to Fairburn and other senior managers were \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d and have \u201ctarnished\u201d the housebuilder\u2019s name. Stirling said that Fairburn\u2019s offer to reduce his bonus from his legally entitled \u00a3110m to \u00a375m \u201cdoes not even get close to acceptable\u201d. Stirling declared: \u201cThe important point I referred to is that regardless of any moral or societal duties, company directors have a legal responsibility to act in the best long-term interests of the company that employs them Today\u2019s remuneration results suggest that the executive directors at Persimmon have lost sight of that because the long-term success of the company is being endangered by the reputational damage associated with grossly excessive pay!\u201d The Church of England has also weighed Persimmon in the balance, and found it wanting: The owner of the UK\u2019s first and oldest luxury leather lingerie brand is also caught up in the TSB IT crisis. Jules Hawkins, 54, who owns Bristol-based Lux Tenebrae, has been unable to pay her staff through her TSB accounts. That echoes the problems reported earlier this morning (here and here) Jules tells us: \u201cI\u2019m going to have to pay them out of my First Direct personal account, which will look to HMRC like I\u2019m paying myself a huge amount of money when I eventually manage to reimburse myself. My staff don\u2019t have TSB accounts so why should they have to bear the brunt of this mess by going overdrawn and having to wait to claim back? It\u2019s the end of the month and they have rent and bills to pay. Also, are my automated payments still going out? Did I just pay my tax? Don\u2019t even get me started on trying to input my end of year tax return.\u201d Matt from South Wales is on holiday in the Canary Islands and has been unable to pay for goods and services thanks to TSB\u2019s botched IT migration: \u201cI arrived on Saturday for a five night break and this has totally ruined my holiday. My card was declined in a restaurant I went to and I had to walk 50 mins back to my hotel as I didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for a taxi. I tried to contact TSB via email and on the phone but after waiting for 40 mins I couldn\u2019t wait any longer. I feel for everyone that\u2019s having these problems and I can\u2019t wait to get home to speak to someone from in person. They are not keeping their customers updated and they will lose a lot of customers due to this terrible service. How can we trust them after this?\u201d Louise (not her real name) is a sole trader who holds both a business and current account with TSB: \u201cThe whole thing is a fiasco. I knew that the site would be down as TSB said they were \u2018upgrading\u2019 the business banking and instead of the trusty card reader that I\u2019ve been using for years they would be introducing a system which uses an app instead. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m a web designer and tech savvy I didn\u2019t want to install the app for various reasons (size, privacy, just don\u2019t want it on my phone!) but did so reluctantly. The amount of permissions the app wanted was outrageous so I emailed them to say that I wasn\u2019t happy and that from 25 May when GDPR comes into force I\u2019d be contacting them every day to delete the unnecessary data that they were collecting via the app. \u201cA very rapid response suggested that I order one of their basic devices instead, which I did. Credit where credit is due, it arrived promptly yesterday, just in time for the new system to be live. Except of course it\u2019s not live. The system is still down. Also the basic device seems incapable of doing anything at all. This is one of those \u2018upgrades\u2019 that seems completely futile and designed to annoy customers.\u201d A stream of TSB customers are reporting that they can\u2019t get their TSB internet passwords to work. Penny Simpson tells me that she has been frozen out of her account, because the bank\u2019s new IT system isn\u2019t recognising customers\u2019 existing passwords and memorable information. She says she\u2019s not alone: I have spoken to more than a dozen people and nobody has managed to get through. Have we really gone through all this pain to install a system that can\u2019t cope with 1.9m customers? Penny was eventually forced to drive eight miles to her nearest branch, Gillingham in Dorset. Staff looked like they\u2019d \u201cbeen in an earthquake\u201d, she says. To take money out they have to use handwritten slips like the old credit cards. I wanted to know my balance which, after two or three attempts they were able to access. My direct debits have been going out - what a pity Paul Pester couldn\u2019t have reassured customers that despite the problems, standing orders etc were being processed. However, I was told that this branch will be closing in May. My next nearest branch will be 26 miles away. Totally unacceptable.... I will move banks as soon as the system is running again. Another TSB customer, Louise Pennington, found herself at the back of a long queue: Other TSB customers are also reporting similar problems when they try to log on: Another dissatisfied customer: Clean Sheet, a charity that helps former offenders to find work, can\u2019t log into its TSB account to pay staff -- another sign that the IT meltdown isn\u2019t fully fixed yet. Guardian readers have been in touch about how they\u2019ve been affected by the TSB IT failures. Angela from Kent is concerned about her upcoming holiday: \u201cWe are going away on Saturday and can\u2019t transfer money from our savings to buy holiday clothes and travel money. We didn\u2019t bother trying to contact TSB as their phone call waiting time is over an hour!\u201d Mark, 54 from Birmingham was on hold for three hours after seeing his account was showing in US dollars: \u201cMy account is showing \u00a340k in arrears against my mortgage and the whole account shows in dollars. I can live with all of that but yesterday my son couldn\u2019t eat as I couldn\u2019t transfer funds to his Parent Pay account. Everybody can have issues but the true measure is how you rectify them. TSB\u2019s contingency has been very poorly thought out and will undoubtedly cost them long-term loyal customers.\u201d Jos is on a low income, with no credit cards or savings accounts and unable to use his debit card: \u201cI have \u00a33.14 in my pocket, my wife is disabled and we can\u2019t shop for food. I\u2019ve been able to see my account details twice on the app since Sunday - both times the balance was wrong with credits and debits to the account missing. I have been particularly infuriated by TSB\u2019s claims of \u201cintermittent\u201d problems which is entirely untrue.\u201d You can get in touch with your experiences, here. TSB\u2019s IT chaos is threatening to prevent some small businesses from paying their staff. Scottish domestic cleaning service Good Fairy Clean couldn\u2019t access its account this morning, which is very problematic as it has wages to pay. This accountancy firm also suffered problems: Here\u2019s Press Association\u2019s take: TSB is continuing to limit access to its mobile banking app and online service after days of delays that saw customers unable to use their accounts. Chief executive Paul Pester announced on Twitter on Wednesday morning that the services had been restored and thanked customers, many of whom had been left furious by the outage, for their \u201cpatience and bearing with us\u201d. However a spokeswoman said the bank was limiting the number of customers to ensure those able to access the app received a normal service. She recommended customers continue to try to open the app, but to close it down and restart if they encounter problems. Those continuing to experience issues should contact TSB\u2019s telephone banking service, she said. If you\u2019ve been affected by TSB\u2019s online banking failure and would like to share your experiences, anonymously if you prefer, then please do so via the form here. Your responses will only be seen by the Guardian and we\u2019ll feature some of your responses in our reporting. More reports of vanishing mortgages: Five hours after CEO Paul Pester claimed things were \u2018up and running\u2019, the complaints are still rolling in: Chris Hodgson, director of education technology provider @discoverelearn, has managed to get into his TSB account....only to hit problems making a payment: TSB\u2019s services may be \u2018up\u2019 at last, but - at least for some users - they are shuffling rather than running. That\u2019s because TSB are restricting the number of customers who can get online at once, in an attempt to avoid being overwhelmed by demand. So, many customers are still being blocked from internet banking, and told to \u2018keep trying\u2019.... At least two TSB customers have found that their mortgages have vanished this morning. Scores of TSB users are reporting problems getting into their accounts this morning, suggesting things aren\u2019t as \u2018up and running\u2019 as the company claims. Translater Adam Ramsey was thwarted when he tried to get online: Actor Annabel Taylor has similar problems: And they\u2019re not alone either... Good morning. After days of disruption, is the UK bank TSB finally getting to grips with its IT chaos? Staff at the bank have been working through the night, after its botched technology migration left around 2 million customers unable to access their money online since Friday. TSB had reassured customers that services should have restored yesterday afternoon, once it had tackled the blunders that meant things weren\u2019t working properly when the migration officially ended on Sunday night. Instead, it took until 3.40 this morning until CEO Paul Pester could declare that services were \u201cup and running\u201d, and thank customers for their \u201cpatience and bearing with us\u201d. Mission accomplished? Perhaps not. Some TSB users are already reporting that they can\u2019t get into their accounts, as the bank struggles to cope with the pent-up demand. TSB really needs to address these concerns quickly. The Daily Mail has given the bank a rollicking this morning, and there are already suggestions that Pester should lose his bonus over the fiasco. Also coming up today European stock markets are expected to drop, following a bloody day on Wall Street yesterday. In the City, Lloyds Banking Group is reporting results \u2013 and Whitbread is announcing the spin-off of its Costa Coffee chain.",

The amount of permissions the app wanted was outrageous so I emailed them to say that I wasn\u2019t happy and that from 25 May when GDPR comes into force I\u2019d be contacting them every day to delete the unnecessary data that they were collecting via the app. </p> <p>\u201cA very rapid response suggested that I order one of their basic devices instead, which I did. Credit where credit is due, it arrived promptly yesterday, just in time for the new system to be live. Except of course it\u2019s not live. The system is still down.

      "bodyText": "Godda, in the Indian state of Jharkhand, is surrounded by the country\u2019s most productive coalmines. It will soon also be home to the Adani group\u2019s latest coal-fired power station, a plant built for the sole purpose of sending energy across the border to Bangladesh. Adani has framed its planned 1,600-megawatt Godda power plant as a humanitarian venture. In a statement to Guardian Australia, the company said it had acted \u201cin the large interests of our neighbours, the people of Bangladesh\u201d by inking the deal. But market analysts say the supply agreement is anything but benevolent. The tariffs quoted by the Bangladesh Power Development Board are about double the current cost of solar and wind power in India. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Tim Buckley, a former head of equity research at Citigroup and now an analyst with the pro-renewable energy group the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), says there is a more obvious reason for Adani to build Godda: to prop up the prospects of the proposed Carmichael megamine in Queensland. Two deadlines for Adani to finance Carmichael have come and gone. Buckley said potential investors had balked, partly because there were no \u201cbankable\u201d off-take agreements in place. Effectively, Adani has nothing concrete to demonstrate that it can sell, and profit from, the high-ash coal it plans to extract from the Galilee basin. Adani did not respond directly to a series of questions asking the company to outline specific plans and agreements for Carmichael coal. It said in a statement that \u201cas a significant coal trader in the region, Adani is well-placed to secure customers for Carmichael coal both from within the Adani group of companies and outside the group\u201d. \u201cIndia remains a key market for Carmichael coal,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are also targeting growth in demand for seaborne thermal coal from Asia. The seaborne thermal coal market has recorded average per annum growth of 4.9% over the last decade and continued growth is forecast, this will create opportunities for the Australian coal industry.\u201d Initially, Adani had planned to run its own vertically integrated \u201cpit-to-plug\u201d operation, taking coal from the Galilee basin, transporting it to Adani-owned power stations in India, and increasing profits by cutting out middlemen. Up to 16m tonnes a year from the proposed Queensland mine was earmarked for the Mundra power plant in Gujarat. But Mundra has since fallen into serious financial difficulty, making the \u201cpit-to-plug\u201d vision largely untenable. Adani\u2019s subsidiary Adani Power has a net debt of about US$7bn. Last year it offered to sell majority control in the Mundra power station to a government entity for one rupee. Mundra and other privately run coastal power stations have to import coal because of Indian rules that give state-owned entities control over the domestic resource. As world coal prices have spiked, those same power stations have struggled to turn a profit. The Indian association of power producers has claimed that coal is unviable in India at prices above US$70 a tonne. The current price is about US$95 a tonne. Despite Godda\u2019s proximity to India\u2019s coal heartland, Adani would have to import coal to the new plant. The company\u2019s Australian arm has already begun to hint that this will come from Carmichael. At an event in Brisbane last month the chief executive of Adani Australia, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, was reported by News Corp as saying Galilee coal had been \u201cbooked\u201d. Buckley estimates the 700km \u2013 and 8km/h \u2013 train journey to Godda from the coast would add US$16 a tonne to the cost of coal to fuel the new plant, relative to a coastal power plant. He says the deal is clearly not in the interests of Bangladesh, which would bear the costs of imported coal and unnecessary transport. Buckley said the country could import power more cheaply by seeking fuel-agnostic competitive tenders from the Indian market. \u201cThe logistics of the proposal can only work because the power purchase agreement allows Adani Power to pass the full cost of importing the coal on to Bangladesh.\u201d \u201cGodda would lock Bangladesh into expensive electricity with high emissions at a time when cleaner, cheaper alternative sources of energy are rapidly being deployed across India,\u201d Buckley said. The deal with Adani has prompted protests in Dhaka on environmental grounds that have had to be broken up by police. Prof Ijaz Hossain, an analyst in Bangladesh, says the country \u201cis in a precarious situation\u201d. \u201cThe main reason is we used to depend on natural gas, but it\u2019s running out,\u201d Hossain says. He says even under the best options, the cost of electricity is going to rise fivefold in the country in coming years and the Adani deal would provide electricity in greater quantities than Indian public-sector companies could provide. \u201cThe reality in terms of getting electricity in Bangladesh is: expensive electricity or no electricity. So any electricity coming from any source that is cheaper than the options we have is a good deal. \u201cWe need thousands of megawatts. If the [Indian public sector] could give us 5,000MW I would say, take it. But where will they get it from? \u201cSo if sourcing the coal is done by the Adani group, it\u2019s very favourable for Bangladesh. This is a good project for Bangladesh if it takes off.\u201d Reports this month suggested the governments of India and Bangladesh were discussing a low-cost 2000MW solar power supply arrangement to Bangladesh. Adani said in a statement that \u201cthe electricity supply agreement and proposed power project have been envisaged after due diligence and prudent planning in the large interest of our neighbours \u2013 the people of Bangladesh\u201d. \u201cThe [IEEFA] report is based on certain assumptions and inferences, which are inconsistent with the factual aspects of this initiative between the two nations. Its authors/activists have not consulted us to check the facts.\u201d",
