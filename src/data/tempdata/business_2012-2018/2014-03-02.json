      "bodyText": "Just as the world becomes more uncertain, Britain has left itself open to the worst the world can throw at it by becoming a net importer of fuel and a bigger importer of food. If governments are supposed to act as risk managers, protecting their populations from a dangerously volatile and unstable world economy, then successive British governments have failed. The UK is not the only major nation struggling to deal with higher global fuel and food prices and limited home grown resources. Japan, having switched off the last of its 52 nuclear power stations last September as the Fukushima situation deteriorated, has been spending much of the wealth it built up over the last 30 years on imports of liquefied natural gas. The latest figures show gas imports hit $69bn (\u00a341m) last year and were the primary reason the country's trade deficit soared to $112bn in 2013 from $67bn in the previous year. Not surprisingly, the Japanese government said last month it aims to get the reactors restarted. China, Germany and the US have acted in different ways to insure themselves \u2013 with differing degrees of success, but they have at least acted. China has sought deals with individual countries to preserve lines of access to food and fuel. Long-term deals with Brazil and a host of cash-strapped African nations have kept the Chinese economic machine turning when harvests have failed and world markets have been convulsed by commodity price shocks. The US, a significant agricultural producer that also controls vast amounts of the world's food through private trading companies such as Cargill and General Mills, has always been more vulnerable to fuel price shocks than the ups and downs of food commodity prices. But in recent years, by unleashing its huge reserves of shale gas, it has been insulated even from this market turmoil. Washington has done all it can without breaching World Trade Organisation rules to prevent its fracking boom from driving down the world price of gas by blocking the conversion of terminals designed to import the stuff into terminals that can export it. Germany, meanwhile, has spent the last 15 years installing enough solar and wind generation to cope with 30% of its fuel needs. That leaves the country still dependent for much of its power on imports of fossil fuels, especially after the decision to run down its nuclear power stations, but provides a partial buffer against volatile prices and geo-political problems \u2013 usually in the form of a row with Russia. In Britain most of the debate around risk has ignored food and fuel in favour of finance: reducing high levels of borrowing by households and the government and finding ways to stop banks from courting another disaster. Little attention was paid to energy and food prices until last year, when Labour highlighted how the cost of fuel was wrecking household incomes and Ed Miliband ignited the issue by arguing prices needed to be frozen to give ministers time to construct a new market structure. The obsession with the risks posed by banks was understandable, after Britain was one of the countries worst affected by the banking crash and very obviously one of the most vulnerable to the next disaster without significant reform. Yet analysis by Julian Morgan, chief economist of the Green Alliance thinktank, shows how rising energy prices are part of a longer term commodity price shock that poses an equally profound problem to the UK economy, if not an even deeper one. In terms of risk management, this administration and the next will need to adopt even more unpalatable policies than those required to rein in renegade banks. Not so long ago Britain was happy to ride the energy price rollercoaster: in the 1980s most domestic heating and industrial needs were met by North Sea gas and domestic coal. Later, when coal imports became the norm, the price was helpfully low. As a net exporter of oil, any rise in petrol prices had the positive side-effect of bringing extra foreign exchange and bumper tax receipts. As Morgan charts in his report, The Great Resource Price Shock, for 20 years the west enjoyed an unprecedented glut of commodities and with it ultra-low prices \u2013 a period known as the great moderation. Everything from copper to wheat and oil was in plentiful supply. In the late 1990s the price of North Sea Brent crude averaged $16 to $20 a barrel. Today the figure is nearer $108. But unlike in the 1970s, when two overnight increases in oil prices quadrupled the cost in the west and then quadrupled it again, oil prices and the gas prices that are tied umbilically to them, began their steady journey upwards from 2003. Unfortunately, the rise coincided with the moment Britain became a net importer of oil. Though the price dropped to $40 a barrel in the aftermath of the banking crash, it has recovered strongly and ranks as a huge cost to the UK economy, with comparatively little offsetting income from the declining gas and oil businesses of Aberdeen. Then there is the rising cost of food and the UK's increasing reliance on imports to feed the nation. Morgan's report shows that between 2000 and 2012 Britain's net dependency on imports of food rose from 33% to 38%. He documents how between 2003 and 2013 world fuel prices rose four times and metal prices trebled. Food prices roughly doubled. In that time the Bank of England, which has the job of controlling inflation, was forced to write 14 letters to the Treasury explaining why inflation was at least one percentage point higher than its 2% target. Morgan, who has gone back over those letters, found that on only one occasion did Bank governor Mervyn King blame an overheating economy and that was in 2007, months ahead of the Northern Rock debacle. In many he blamed the rise in VAT to 20%. In all the others, King said either the depreciation of the pound or rising import prices underpinned rising domestic prices. In recent months, sterling has begun to rise, but this is unlikely to bring the situation back into equilibrium. North Sea oil and gas is in long-term decline, so as the economy recovers and the demand for fuel increases, Britain must import more, offsetting sterling's greater purchasing power. The effect can be seen in the last trade deficit figures. During the third quarter of 2013, our trade deficit equalled 5.1% of GDP, the biggest in more than 20 years. Morgan shows how rising fuel and food prices have eaten into real incomes more than even Labour has laid out in its assault on government policy. We know average real earnings fell in the decade up to 2013 \u2013 coming down from \u00a3327 to \u00a3319 a week once inflation is factored in. But if the effects of rising fuel and food prices are removed, by excluding energy and unprocessed food, real average earnings would have risen over the decade, to \u00a3335 a week. In other words, Morgan says, real earnings could have been around 5% higher in 2013. An average \u00a32,954 annual bill for food and \u00a31,206 spent on domestic fuel in 2012 would have been \u00a32,532 for food and \u00a3619 for fuel if fuel and food prices had risen only in line with the overall consumer prices index, rather than galloping ahead. It implies a combined household saving of more than \u00a31,000 a year on essential bills. Green Alliance advocates Britain take a more activist stance on energy and food conservation, alongside greater spending on renewable energy production, to protect against further price shocks and the volatility that always seems to send prices up rather than down. It is a policy that former environment minister Chris Huhne adopted before he was forced to resign and one that has dissipated under George Osborne's austerity programme. There are two political problems with this: first, restricting food waste and fuel conservation are unglamorous; secondly, they involve government intervention at a moment in history when most governments are likened to estate agents \u2013 trusted to do little more than look out for themselves. And for those looking to shale gas to alleviate at least half of the problem \u2013 as Osborne admitted last month to a House of Lords committee \u2013 it will be produced by foreign companies and mostly exported, leaving only employment and taxes as the main benefits.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Five years ago this week, on 5 March 2009, the Bank of England took the dramatic step of cutting interest rates to their lowest level in more 300 years. The previous 18 months had seen Northern Rock nationalised, RBS, Lloyds and HBOS rescued by massive taxpayer bailouts and Lehman Brothers collapse in the United States. House prices were falling, car sales plunging and Britain found itself facing a deep depression. For a decade before the crisis the Bank had dealt in finely tuned adjustments, usually amounting to a scrupulously judged quarter point cut or rise. But in 2008 everything changed and it took just five months to slash the base rate from 5% down to 0.5%. And there it has stayed, with rate-setting committee member David Miles last week suggesting 5% would not be seen again for years, perhaps never. Homeowners and businesses have undoubtedly been saved from repossession or administration, but savers have watched their savings growth dwindle to almost nothing as the UK adjusts to an era of low rates. These are the effects on both winners and losers. Mortgage payers Homeowners with mortgages have been the big beneficiaries of record low rates, especially those lucky or canny enough to have had mortgage deals tied to the base rate as it plummeted. Many of those mega-deals have since ended, but there are still borrowers sitting on cheap standard variable rates and enjoying monthly repayments much lower than they signed up for. Six years ago, before the crunch, the average SVR stood at 7.24%; it is now 4.39%, with some paying as little as 2.5%. Even someone staying on an average SVR, with a \u00a3100,000 interest-only mortgage, will have saved a total of \u00a313,300 over the past five years. There will be many who without the rate cuts would not have been able to hold on to their homes at all. In the previous housing crash in 1991 there were 75,000 repossessions in a year, but this time the number hit only 50,000 in 2009, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, and quickly fell back. Last year there were 29,000, despite the squeeze on household incomes. \"We have had a recession and several years in which real earnings have not increased \u2013 things that are usually associated with a rise in arrears and repossessions,\" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics. \"There's no doubt the low base rate has helped keep these down.\" As well as allowing people to keep up with mortgage payments, it had also effectively made it cheaper for lenders to exercise forbearance, he said. Mortgages have been paid off more quickly, with the Bank of England's reporting that repayments have exceeded the withdrawal of equity by more than \u00a310bn in every quarter since the summer of 2010. However, there is little evidence that people have been taking the chance to overpay and make inroads into their borrowing. With food and energy bills going up, some may have simply diverted any savings into paying for something else. Hilary Osborne Savers Britain's army of small savers, who outnumber mortgage holders by seven to one, have lost out on around \u00a365bn in interest payments since the Bank of England slashed rates, according to consultants McKinsey. Save our Savers, a campaign group borne out of the financial crisis, reckons that the figure is even higher: \"We calculate that savers have lost around \u00a3250bn through a combination of lower interest rates and above-target inflation.\" But it is a peculiarity of the financial crisis that the lower interest rates have fallen, the more we have saved. In the dying days of the boom in early 2008, UK households were saving just 0.2% of their total income every month. But as the banks toppled and worries about job losses mounted, the savings ratio leapt to 8% within a year. It's a sign of renewed confidence that the figure is now falling again. Throughout the crisis, British savers have sought safety first, preferring instant access accounts even at the cost of near-invisible rates of interest. The Bank of England reckons that rates have been so poor that savers have decided to keep their money in easy reach rather than locked away into accounts that pay little extra. Over the past two years alone, the amount kept in instant-access accounts has risen from \u00a3435bn to \u00a3525bn, while the amount in savings bonds has dropped from \u00a3281bn to \u00a3238bn. Money has also poured into cash Isas \u2013 up from \u00a3162bn five years ago to \u00a3227bn now. In the early days of the crisis, banks desperate for cash kept interest rates relatively high despite base rate falling to 0.5%. The real pain for savers came when the government introduced Funding for Lending in July 2012, which gave banks access to cash and made them much less keen to offer competitive rates, said Anna Bowes of savingschampion.co.uk. Since then, rates on \"best buy\" instant access savings accounts have more than halved \u2013 and there's little sign of any respite for savers soon. Patrick Collinson Businesses The era of ultra-low interest rates has saved thousands of businesses and allowed many that would otherwise have gone to the wall to dust themselves down and repay their debts \u2013 but it hasn't made it easy for them to get a loan to expand. Comparisons are hard to make with the early 1990s recession when bankruptcies quadrupled to 32,000, because 10 years ago the Labour government made it much easier to declare insolvency. But the figures show a continuing, gentle rise from 2004 without a 1990s-style jump after 2008. Five years on from the crash, corporate profits are up, borrowings are down and official figures for the last three months of 2013 show businesses are investing again. The 0.5% interest rate and injection of \u00a3375bn into the financial system have also proved an essential support for consumer confidence. The downturn has seen a squeeze on incomes, but low rates have helped to prop up spending on the high street during tough times by freeing up consumer cash with lower mortgage rates. But the combined efforts of the Bank and Treasury to increase lending to the corporate sector have failed. Businesses that need cash to invest in new plant and machinery have found that charges levied by their banks remain high and come with stiff demands for collateral. Even with economic recovery taking hold, a small business owner with a sound business plan who wants a loan can still be asked to put his or her house up as security. Phillip Inman Banks Critics of the banks argue that they have been the chief beneficiaries of low interest rates because they can borrow money cheaply to lend out at a profit. But the picture is not that simple. Banks can borrow for very short periods from the Bank of England, but get the vast majority of their funding from retail deposits or the money markets. \"Bank rate\", though it is used to price many loans, does not determine the rate at which banks can borrow. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said low interest rates have been bad for banks' day-to-day business because they squeezed the margin between borrowing and lending: \"The bad news, most notably for liability [deposit]-heavy banks like HSBC and Standard Chartered, but also others including RBS, has been a marked impact on deposit spreads.\" Building societies have been hit harder because many mortgage borrowers are on standard variable rates that are at rock-bottom. Simon Ward, an economist at Henderson Global Investors, argues that lower rates were needed but that they went too low for too long: \"If anything, low rates have hurt banks' profitability and delayed the recovery because the banks needed to rebuild their balance sheets [from profits] before they could lend again.\" But matters could have been much worse. The Bank of England's view is that low rates were essential to prevent an economic meltdown and huge defaults by households and business borrowers. At his first big speech as Bank governor last year, Mark Carney said that many business loans were linked to the base rate and, until the recovery is in full swing ,rates should remain low.

On the surface, the answer is simple. First, this is in no way a construction boom. Output in the sector is still 11.3% below its pre-crisis peak, a weaker picture than for manufacturing or services. Second, although the number of new homes started last year was the highest since 2007, at 122,590, it was still half the rate needed to keep up with the rising number of households \u2013 never mind the backlog. The number of homes completed is a more useful figure, and that actually fell last year, by 5% to 109,370 \u2013 even further from the 250,000 a year experts say are needed to meet housing demand in England. Government schemes have clearly missed the mark. In the case of Help to Buy and Funding for Lending, they may have made things worse. Easier money has boosted demand, not supply, and helped send prices soaring in some parts of the country. On the supply side, the story is no better. Large numbers spouted by politicians should always be taken with a pinch of salt. On housebuilding, make it an entire mine. Promised new homes generally come in round hundreds of thousands. And whether they are from Labour or the Conservatives, they are all fantasy houses. Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, has made a point of tracking such pledges. In 2007, Gordon Brown promised more than 200,000 new homes a year by 2016. \"Then,\" says Francis, \"we went through a whole raft of policies from the coalition that were going to deliver 100,000 homes each, such as Build Now, Pay Later and NewBuy. More recently, Ed Miliband unveiled plans for new towns and garden cities. \"We'll have a clear aim that by the end of the parliament, Britain will be building 200,000 homes a year,\" he said. The focus on supply is welcome, but politicians need to provide more detail. Who will build all these homes? And how will they clear the hurdles of the planning process and the nimbys who have blocked big housebuilding projects in the past? On that last question, Westminster must recognise that for all the shake-ups, planning is still seen by many builders as a key barrier. As Steve Morgan, chairman of housebuilder Redrow, said when announcing last week's results: \"The planning system is still failing to deliver implementable planning permissions at a fast enough rate to meet demand for housing.\" The nimbys meanwhile must wake up to the social and economic consequences of their opposition to new homes. There are no prizes for guessing who they are. A project by Shelter shows wealthy executives, flourishing families and affluent greys the most likely to oppose housebuilding. In other words, the lucky few from the comfort of their own \u2013 increasingly valuable \u2013 homes. Sure, lack of housing gives you a nice expensive house to retire on, but it also means your children are unable to fly the nest. There is also the cost to taxpayers as house prices go on rising faster than wages. The proportion of working households claiming housing benefit is now higher than when the coalition came to power. More housing requires a cultural shift in house-price-obsessed Britain, as the National Housing Federation argues in its \"Yes to Homes\" campaign. It wants a voice for those banging on the closed door of the housing market. The group, which lobbies for housing associations, is also tackling the question of who builds all the new homes. Osborne would do well to consider the federation's demand for his budget this month to speed up land release and improve housing associations' access to finance. But housing associations and private housebuilders alone are unlikely to get us to the hundreds of thousands. If government really wants to fulfil those promises it needs to get its hands dirty. Local authorities and central government must build houses on a large scale. That would mean more affordable homes, but would spur private housebuilding, too. A new player with a big landbank would shake up the market, so that big housebuilders make money primarily from building houses rather than relying on land values and rising prices. The budget gives Osborne an opportunity to let councils become housebuilders again. His move at the autumn statement to relax limits on borrowing to finance construction was welcome, but local authorities say ditching the cap altogether would allow them to build 60,000 homes, rather than 10,000. Of course, such public building will be from a standing start. But after years of chronic housing shortage, even a slow turnaround is better than no turnaround.",
