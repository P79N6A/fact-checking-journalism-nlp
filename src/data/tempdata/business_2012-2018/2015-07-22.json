      "bodyText": "Barack Obama has removed one of the last obstacles to oil drilling in Arctic waters, granting Shell permission to bore two new exploratory wells. However, the drilling permit granted by the Interior Department on Wednesday bans Shell from drilling into oil-bearing zones until critical spill-response equipment is in place \u2013 and that equipment is aboard a damaged icebreaker en route to Oregon for repairs. The restrictions could severely limit Shell\u2019s operations during the brief Arctic season, which winds down in late September. The company has spent $7bn and seven years trying to open up the Arctic to oil and gas drilling. \u201cShell currently is not permitted to drill into oil-bearing zones,\u201d Brian Salerno, director of the department\u2019s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, said in a statement on Wednesday. The statement said the company would only be able to drill one well at a time and would have to wait to drill deeper into oil-bearing formations until the arrival on site of its capping stack, a critical piece of equipment in the event of a well blowout. That capping stack is aboard the M/V Fennica ice breaker, which sprang a hole in its hull after navigating through shallow waters almost immediately after leaving the Alaskan port of Dutch Harbor earlier this month. \u201cWithout the required well control system in place, Shell will not be allowed to drill into oil-bearing zones,\u201d Salerno said. The conditions puts further limitations on Shell\u2019s plans to open up the Arctic for oil exploration. An earlier decision from the Fish and Wildlife Service required Shell to keep active rigs 15 miles away from walruses and other wildlife. The company had initially planned to drill the wells much closer, allowing Shell to move more easily between the two sites. The new conditions following growing pressure from campaigners against Arctic drilling. Al Gore, a former vice-president, said this month that drilling for new sources of oil in the harsh conditions of the Arctic was \u201cinsane\u201d \u2013 especially given scientists\u2019 conclusion that the majority of fossil fuels must stay in the ground to avoid dangerous climate change. But the potential short-term rewards for a company like Shell are enormous, with the Arctic ocean believed to contain about 20% of the world\u2019s untapped and recoverable oil and gas reserves. So far, the company has got in one short \u2013 and disaster-prone \u2013 season of Arctic drilling, after its Kulluk rig ran aground on an island in late 2012. Since then, the Obama administration has imposed more stringent conditions \u2013 such as the requirement for a capping stack \u2013 intended to avoid an oil spill disaster in the Arctic. However, campaigners said that even Wednesday\u2019s conditions did not change their overall conclusion that it was a mistake to open up drilling in the Arctic. The Natural Resources Defense Council said the permits were \u201cmisguided\u201d. Cassady Sharp, a campaigner for Greenpeace, noted that the discovery of the hole in Fennica demonstrated the perils of trying to drill for oil in the harsh conditions of the Arctic. \u201cBy opening up the Arctic to oil drilling, President Obama is courting disaster and undermining his legacy on climate change. The world cannot afford to burn Arctic oil, and the consequences of a spill would be enormous,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201c It it not too late for President Obama to finally come to terms with the disaster in the Arctic that could happen on his watch.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "By this fall, a sausage McGriddle from McDonald\u2019s could be on the dinner table. The company sent an internal memo to US franchisees and employees on Tuesday, which suggested offering all-day breakfasts nationwide in October, according to the Wall Street Journal. The potential change comes just months after McDonald\u2019s began testing an all-day breakfast menu in San Diego and later Nashville and parts of Mississippi. Since the chain introduced a full breakfast menu in 1977, customers have had until 10.30am to make it to their local McDonald\u2019s for an Egg McMuffin sandwich or some hashbrowns. After that, they\u2019re off the menu. At a McDonald\u2019s on 160 Broadway in New York\u2019s Financial District, customers were happy at the prospect of breakfast after 10.30am, although most said they prefer the lunchtime menu options. Even so, when asked how they felt about the change, several answered: \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea.\u201d \u201cFrench toast sticks is my jam,\u201d said 18-year-old Aaron Patterson. Otherwise, he said he didn\u2019t really care. Susan Lundquist, who was eating with her husband and son said although she typically visits McDonald\u2019s for lunch, not breakfast, the expanded menu would be nice for other customers. \u201cIt would be wonderful for people who enjoy their breakfasts,\u201d she said. Nick Gambino and Sammy Gravano, two construction workers standing outside McDonald\u2019s, said incorporating all-day breakfast into the menu will mostly benefit people who don\u2019t wake up early enough to get to a McDonald\u2019s by 10.30am. \u201cOf course some people like eating breakfast all day,\u201d said Gravano. \u201cSometimes I\u2019d rather a cheeseburger for breakfast,\u201d Gambino responded. McDonald\u2019s has previously cited lack of food preparation space as a reason for not serving those french toast sticks and other breakfast foods all day. Some locations currently serve breakfast after midnight. The move comes during a year in which McDonald\u2019s admitted that there was an \u201curgent need to evolve\u201d. In February, worldwide sales fell 1.7% and US sales were down 4%. \u201cServing all-day breakfast is likely the number one request we hear from McDonald\u2019s customers,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re testing it out in a few markets to learn more about this possibility. We know your mouth is watering, but there\u2019s no news on this yet.\u201d When the company began testing all-day breakfasts in March, Terri Hickey, a McDonald\u2019s spokesperson said customers \u201clove McDonald\u2019s breakfast, and they tell us they\u2019d like to enjoy it beyond the morning hours\u201d. All-day breakfast as a national, permanent feature is the latest in several ways McDonald\u2019s has tried to reverse its declining sales this year. In March, the company announced it would stop selling chicken treated with antibiotics used on humans. Later in the same month, McDonald\u2019s organized a marketing \u201cI\u2019m lovin\u2019 it 24\u201d campaign in 24 cities in 24 countries. A toll booth in the Philippines became a McDonald\u2019s drive-thru that offered free toll and a free breakfast. The company\u2019s \u201cpay with lovin\u2019\u201d campaign, which allowed select customers to pay with a dance, a hug or a fist bump, failed to boost sales.",

    "webTitle": "Martin Wheatley legacy \u2013\u00a0tough on the City, but selective briefing a shambles", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u201cI would like to be remembered for setting up a good, solid organisation,\u201d Martin Wheatley said after the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s annual meeting on Wednesday, his last as chief executive. \u201cWe have delivered a systemic shift in the UK in how people think about the financial sector.\u201d The second boast is fair, up to a point. The FCA has whacked payday lenders and Libor manipulators, imposed record fines on errant banks and argued loudly that a healthy financial system requires good behaviour. Wheatley could have done more, of course. Wednesday\u2019s meeting was dominated by grumbles about the regulator\u2019s slow and inadequate response to the scandal of banks\u2019 mis-selling of interest-rate hedging products to small- and medium-sized companies. Wheatley was obliged to concede that lessons would have to be learned. On many occasions, too, the FCA seemed to lack the dynamism of its US counterparts when tackling big market-wide abuses. But, after the timidity of the old Financial Services Authority, credit is due. The FCA has created greater confidence that City wrongdoing will be pursued; firms have been obliged to take compliance seriously. That is why George Osborne\u2019s ousting of Wheatley has been widely interpreted as a triumph for those big banks that grumble about regulatory overkill. But Wheatley\u2019s first claim \u2013 the one about establishing a good and solid organisation \u2013 doesn\u2019t stand up. Last year\u2019s cockup in which the FCA over-briefed a tale on exit fees on old insurance policies to a newspaper and then watched as share prices plunged was regulatory incompetence at its worst. Mistakes happen, but that episode remains astonishing. The FCA should never have indulged in selective briefing in the first place. Worse, it took until the afternoon for the FCA to clarify the modest scope of its inquiry on exit fees. The regulator, supposedly in charge of spotting price-sensitive material, seemed incapable of realising it had breached its own rules. As more than one insurance-sector boss has argued privately, they would have lost their own jobs for less. That is why Wheatley\u2019s authority was damaged and why Osborne was able to oust him. Wheatley is \u201cdisappointed to be moving on\u201d from the FCA but he cannot be surprised. If the botched briefing hadn\u2019t happened, he could have survived the lobbying campaign against him. Don\u2019t bet on it, chairman Meanwhile John Griffith-Jones, chairman of the FCA, says he hopes still to be in post for next year\u2019s meeting. He would be wise not to risk any cash on that outcome. If Osborne wants \u201cdifferent leadership ... to take the organisation to the next stage of development\u201d \u2013 the official reason why Wheatley\u2019s contract was not renewed \u2013 it\u2019s hard to understand why he wouldn\u2019t also insist on a new chairman. It\u2019s the chairman, after all, who is supposed to hold the executives to account. There is also the small matter of the official report into the near-collapse of HBOS in 2008. This time next year the regulators\u2019 review may have seen the light of day, though don\u2019t hold your breath. It would be odd if the bank\u2019s auditors, KPMG, escaped criticism. Griffith-Jones, remember, was chairman of KPMG, which was why his appointment to the FCA caused a stink at the outset. Proper process has been observed \u2013 Griffith-Jones has not been involved in the report \u2013 but publication may bring fresh problems. Keep on digging, BHP Good news from BHP Billiton, the world\u2019s biggest miner: production hit record levels in the last quarter. But, from the point of view of shareholders, this is less than reassuring. The company is producing more but getting paid less \u2013 a lot less. Take a look at BHP\u2019s table of \u201caverage realised prices\u201d to appreciate how far commodity prices have slumped. In the January-to-June period, iron ore prices were down 45% on a year ago; oil is 49% lower; copper is 16% weaker; and the various types of coal have declined by about 20%. With the cooling of the Chinese economy, the \u201csupercycle\u201d in commodity prices is well and truly over. BHP, to be fair, recognised the reality a while ago. The chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, has been talking for ages about efficiencies, cost cuts and discipline in capital spending. But those virtues can only ease the financial pain, not make it disappear. Oversupply in iron ore, in particular, looks to be a fact of life as far as the eye can see. BHP forecasts a 6% increase in its own production this year and it still makes sense for it to keep digging. It can mine the stuff out of Australian desert for $16 a tonne and ship it to China for $10. At the current selling price of $52 a tonne, that\u2019s still a healthy profit margin. It\u2019s just that it feels like famine when memories of $150 a tonne are fresh. Until now, the City\u2019s forecasting community has been confident that most of the big miners\u2019 balance sheets are sufficiently robust to weather the storm. It\u2019s not hard to cut capital expenditure, after all. So maybe those precious dividends can be saved. BHP, like Shell, is a company that can boast that it hasn\u2019t cut its dividend in decades \u2013 not since the Great Depression. If that record can be maintained, there\u2019s a 6% yield up for grabs. Not bad. Yet BHP\u2019s shares fell 5% yesterday, in line with a sector where share prices are at their lowest since the 2008-09 financial crash. Back then, the miners were saved by China\u2019s decision to launch a massive infrastructure programme. That source of salvation will not appear this time. The dividend arithmetic for the big miners is getting tighter.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI would like to be remembered for setting up a good, solid organisation,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/22/martin-wheatley-fca-unfinished-business\">Martin Wheatley</a> said after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/financial-conduct-authority\">Financial Conduct Authority</a>\u2019s annual meeting on Wednesday, his last as chief executive. \u201cWe have delivered a systemic shift in the UK in how people think about the financial sector.\u201d</p> <p>The second boast is fair, up to a point. The FCA has whacked payday lenders and Libor manipulators, imposed record fines on errant banks and argued loudly that a healthy financial system requires good behaviour.</p> <p>Wheatley could have done more, of course. Wednesday\u2019s meeting was dominated by grumbles about the regulator\u2019s slow and inadequate response to the scandal of banks\u2019 mis-selling of interest-rate hedging products to small- and medium-sized companies. Wheatley was obliged to concede that lessons would have to be learned.</p> <p>On many occasions, too, the FCA seemed to lack the dynamism of its US counterparts when tackling big market-wide abuses. But, after the timidity of the old Financial Services Authority, credit is due. The FCA has created greater confidence that City wrongdoing will be pursued; firms have been obliged to take compliance seriously. That is why George Osborne\u2019s ousting of Wheatley has been widely interpreted as a triumph for those big banks that grumble about regulatory overkill.</p> <p>But Wheatley\u2019s first claim \u2013 the one about establishing a good and solid organisation \u2013 doesn\u2019t stand up. Last year\u2019s cockup in which the FCA over-briefed a tale on exit fees on old insurance policies to a newspaper and then watched as share prices plunged was regulatory incompetence at its worst.</p> <p>Mistakes happen, but that episode remains astonishing. The FCA should never have indulged in selective briefing in the first place. Worse, it took until the afternoon for the FCA to clarify the modest scope of its inquiry on exit fees. The regulator, supposedly in charge of spotting price-sensitive material, seemed incapable of realising it had breached its own rules. As more than one insurance-sector boss has argued privately, they would have lost their own jobs for less.</p> <p>That is why Wheatley\u2019s authority was damaged and why Osborne was able to oust him. Wheatley is \u201cdisappointed to be moving on\u201d from the FCA but he cannot be surprised. If the botched briefing hadn\u2019t happened, he could have survived the lobbying campaign against him.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t bet on it, chairman </h2> <p>Meanwhile John Griffith-Jones, chairman of the FCA, says he hopes still to be in post for next year\u2019s meeting. He would be wise not to risk any cash on that outcome. If Osborne wants \u201cdifferent leadership ... to take the organisation to the next stage of development\u201d \u2013 the official reason why Wheatley\u2019s contract was not renewed \u2013 it\u2019s hard to understand why he wouldn\u2019t also insist on a new chairman. It\u2019s the chairman, after all, who is supposed to hold the executives to account.</p> <p>There is also the small matter of the official report into the near-collapse of HBOS in 2008. This time next year the regulators\u2019 review may have seen the light of day, though don\u2019t hold your breath. It would be odd if the bank\u2019s auditors, KPMG, escaped criticism. Griffith-Jones, remember, was chairman of KPMG, which was why his appointment to the FCA caused a stink at the outset. Proper process has been observed \u2013 Griffith-Jones has not been involved in the report \u2013 but publication may bring fresh problems.</p> <h2>Keep on digging, BHP</h2> <p>Good news from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bhpbilliton\">BHP Billiton</a>, the world\u2019s biggest miner: production hit record levels in the last quarter. But, from the point of view of shareholders, this is less than reassuring. The company is producing more but getting paid less \u2013 a lot less.</p> <p>Take a look at BHP\u2019s table of \u201caverage realised prices\u201d to appreciate how far commodity prices have slumped. In the January-to-June period, iron ore prices were down 45% on a year ago; oil is 49% lower; copper is 16% weaker; and the various types of coal have declined by about 20%. With the cooling of the Chinese economy, the \u201csupercycle\u201d in commodity prices is well and truly over.</p> <p>BHP, to be fair, recognised the reality a while ago. The chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, has been talking for ages about efficiencies, cost cuts and discipline in capital spending. But those virtues can only ease the financial pain, not make it disappear.</p> <p>Oversupply in iron ore, in particular, looks to be a fact of life as far as the eye can see. BHP forecasts a 6% increase in its own production this year and it still makes sense for it to keep digging. It can mine the stuff out of Australian desert for $16 a tonne and ship it to China for $10. At the current selling price of $52 a tonne, that\u2019s still a healthy profit margin.

The seven-floor store in Baku\u2019s Globus Plaza no longer runs under the upmarket department store\u2019s name after a split with licence partner Perfomans, part of a local investment company. A statement said: \u201cHarvey Nichols has terminated its licence agreement with the operator of the Baku store. Consequently, the Baku store no longer operates under the Harvey Nichols brand.\u201d The retailer said it could not comment further for legal reasons. The Baku outlet was the department store\u2019s eighth overseas venture, joining others in Turkey, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Dubai. The 110,000 sq ft store was Harvey Nichols\u2019 largest outside London, offering stylists, personal shoppers, restaurants, a beauty hall and more than 500 international designer brands. At the time of the opening, Harvey Nichols\u2019 chief executive, Stacey Cartwright, said: \u201cThis market is fast becoming one of the top luxury retail destinations in the world and we are excited to offer the ultimate in luxury shopping and hospitality to the discerning customer in Baku.\u201d But trade journal Retail Week reported that Harvey Nichols began moves to exit the store within weeks of opening. Azerbaijan, formerly part of the Soviet Union, houses a fast-growing market for luxury goods, with Baku home to stores for brands including Dior, Burberry, Armani and Valentino. Last month the country played host to the inaugural European Games, organised by the European Olympic committee amid protests from human rights organisations over locking up journalists and activists in the buildup. Azerbaijan\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, who inherited his job from his father, a former KGB general, invested a reported \u00a36.5bn in sports venues and infrastructure for the games, but the human rights group Index on Censorship has accused him of using the event to \u201cwhitewash\u201d the country\u2019s reputation in the wake of a crackdown on freedom of speech. Harvey Nichols\u2019 exit from the country comes as it prepares to open a new store in Birmingham on Friday. The 45,000 sq ft store, in the Mailbox shopping centre, is about twice the size of the retailer\u2019s previous Birmingham outlet.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Could a hashtag and celebrities be the way into a young woman\u2019s medicine cabinet? Allergan sure hopes so, as on Tuesday morning the company launched a new online campaign, #ActuallySheCan, targeting millennial women. The maker of Botox, plus eye care, skin and digestive drugs, is also a maker of \u201chalf a dozen products for reproductive health\u201d like menopause management, fertility and birth control, according to Bill Meury, EVP and president of branded pharma at Allergan. Women make up 62% of their market in the US and the company works with more than 30,000 US obstetricians and gynecologists, the company said. Getting into women\u2019s medicine cabinets while they are in their early 20s could help convert them into loyal long-term consumers. That\u2019s where #ActuallySheCan comes in. A combination of an educational website about different forms of birth control, live events packed with celebrities and a social media campaign, it attempts to connect with millennial women \u201cin their own language\u201d. Millennials are often defined as those born between 1980 and 2000. That would make the target demographic for this campaign 15 to 35 years old. At the same time, the campaign serves as a platform to advertise Allergan\u2019s women\u2019s health products. The push to get Lo Loestrin and Liletta, a recently FDA-approved intrauterine device, into the public sphere could be interpreted as Allergan\u2019s attempt to rebrand itself as a women\u2019s healthcare company. This would not be a bad idea, considering that in May, the company reported that in the first quarter its North American brands revenue from women\u2019s health products increased 26% to $267.5m. The question is: could it work? \u201cWe made this significant investment to help women get more informed, more educated, because those are real needs. Seventy per cent of unplanned pregnancies are among millennial women,\u201d said Herm Cukier, vice-president of women\u2019s healthcare at Allergan. \u201cAs a leading manufacturer of multiple contraceptive products, we felt there was an opportunity for us to play that role, not by pushing information out, but by creating an environment they find interesting, engaging. And they are going to learn more information and also be more empowered to discuss healthcare options with their provider.\u201d The company would not disclose how much it actually spent on the campaign \u2013 which features Leah Michele Sarfati of Glee fame, social media star Lo Bosworth and YouTube celebrity iJustine. This is not the first time that Allergan has attempted to connect with women online. In April, Allergan launched another site, called Iact4women. The interactive site allows users to collect virtual coins through various activities that can then be converted into actual donations to one of three charities chosen by the company. Users who visit the site are informed that they can help donate up to $500,000 to the charities \u2013 an amount to which Allergan has committed as part of the Iact4women campaign. As of Tuesday afternoon, the site had raised $30,274.50. When it launched, an internal memo said: \u201c[Allergan] pledges to donate almost half a million dollars to the three participating Iact4women charities: Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network, National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, American Association of University Women.\u201d Steve Brozak, managing partner and president of WBB securities, told the Guardian when asked about Iact4women: \u201cYou want to be taken seriously? The website cost more than the 30 grand they raised so far and you can quote me on that. It\u2019s like, what are these people thinking?\u201d Cukier said that Iact4women is a program the company is proud of and that the site will be linked to #ActuallySheCan. He added that the design of the new campaign amplifies the success of the first one. \u201cWhat we did learn is that there is a real need and a real opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s need for more information, for more engagement [with women].\u201d Brozak said: \u201cAllergan can say they are a women\u2019s healthcare company, but just having a website that says I act for women and 30 grand in donations does not speak volumes.\u201d He says companies should not just pay lip service to being there for women but actually be there for them by developing products that improve their health. \u201cYou would go out there and acquire new products, not just a website. I am not that big of a fan of awareness. I am a big fan of developing drugs and getting them to market.\u201d The current approach, he said, might bring about \u201cgreater visibility rather than greater substance\u201d. Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, also raised concern. \u201cEducation without product line \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a winning business strategy,\u201d he said. Gordon, who follows the company, said pharmaceutical companies should decide whether they want to invest in marketing, like these websites, or in research and development of future products that could cure diseases like ovarian and breast cancer. \u201cIf you want to position yourself as a women\u2019s healthcare group, what you don\u2019t do is create a website that exalts your product. You create products that change women\u2019s health.\u201d According to Allergan, #Actuallyshecan is more than just a website. It\u2019s an environment that spans all social networks. I can\u2019t even \u201cThe #Actuallyshecan is a fun spinoff what\u2019s a common, I guess, statement by millennial women: \u2018I can\u2019t even\u2019,\u201d Cukier told the Guardian, adding that the campaign is meant to be lighthearted. When asked if that could be interpreted as condescending or as talking down to women, Meury said that Allergan is \u201csensitive to the tone and the quality of the information and the programs\u201d it launches. \u201cWe hope to get it right the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have invested a great deal of time in this area because we have a long term view of the relationship that we are trying to create between the company and, in this case, millennial women.\u201d Allergan is not opposed to potentially creating similar campaign for men down the road. Who knows \u2013 #Actuallyhecan could be next.",

The push to get Lo Loestrin and Liletta, a recently FDA-approved intrauterine device, into the public sphere could be interpreted as Allergan\u2019s attempt to rebrand itself as a women\u2019s healthcare company.

    "webTitle": "Martin Wheatley: I had unfinished business at FCA", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The ousted chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority has expressed disappointment about his departure, saying he had \u201cunfinished business\u201d as the City\u2019s top regulator. Martin Wheatley was speaking in public for the first time since his surprise departure was announced last Friday. Wheatley is to step down in September after the chancellor, George Osborne, decided not to renew his five-year contract. That contract was due to end next March, but in a statement Osborne said the City\u2019s top watchdog needed \u201cdifferent leadership\u201d. Wheatley told the FCA\u2019s annual public meeting\u2013 which was peppered with angry exchanges about the regulator\u2019s handling of compensation from banks for interest rates swap mis-selling - that he still had work to do. Addressing the meeting at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre in London, he said: \u201cI am disappointed to be moving on and I do with a sense of unfinished businesses.\u201d He later listed the ongoing work to clean up markets through the Fair and Effective Markets review and the implementation of the Senior Managers Regime, which is intended to hold top bosses to account when things go wrong. The cleanup was prompted by the Libor rigging scandal. Wheatley, whose role as chief executive will be temporarily filled by Tracey McDermott, a senior official at the regulator, was brought to London from Hong Kong, where he had also been running the regulator, by Osborne when the coalition government was overhauling City governance after the 2008 financial crisis. Wheatley became the first chief executive of the FCA when the Financial Services Authority was broken up. Following speculation that the City is facing a more lenient approach from regulators, he said there was a risk \u201cpeople will forget\u201d the problems the industry faced in 2008. John Griffith-Jones, the FCA chairman, insisted there would not be a change in attitude and paid tribute to Wheatley, saying: \u201cI can tell you that establishing a culture at a new organisation is a pretty lonely top-down process.\u201d Griffith-Jones has also faced questions over his position as chairman. But when asked on Wednesday about his future, said: \u201cI have every intention of being at this meeting next year.\u201d The FCA has levied a record level of fines on financial firms since Wheatley took the helm. Fines were handed down for foreign exchange rigging earlier this year and Wheatley said conduct issues were now at the forefront of the minds of the bosses of leading firms. \u201cI\u2019m more convinced than ever that conduct is the top of firms\u2019 agendas. It is no longer an afterthought,\u201d he said. Wholesale markets such as forex, however, were an \u201carea that has much further to go\u201d in improving culture, he added. Michael Mason-Mahon, a member of the public speaking from the floor, was critical of the FCA and Wheatley. \u201cAre you the worst joke that ever happened to the financial services industry?\u201d he said, after claiming the regulator was not scrutinising information that it had received. He also questioned why members of the board of HSBC had not been removed despite being accused of laundering cash by US regulators. Wheatley and other members of the FCA board faced sustained questioning over the handling of the interest rates swap mis-selling scandal. He was forced to admit that no fines have been issued and no individuals have had their licences revoked as a result. The only course of action for individuals who feel they have been wrongly turned down for compensation is the courts, McDermott said. One campaigner said evidence had been found of criminality among bankers who sold interest rate swaps. For the fourth year, investor activist Philip Meadowcroft asked when the report into the near-collapse of HBOS seven years ago would be published. Griffith-Jones, who is recused from discussions about the report because he chaired the bank\u2019s auditor, KPMG, said there had been no political pressure to withhold the document, adding: \u201cNo such wink, nudge, email has existed.\u201d On Tuesday, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, wrote to Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury select committee, to warned that further delays were occurring to the HBOS report.",
