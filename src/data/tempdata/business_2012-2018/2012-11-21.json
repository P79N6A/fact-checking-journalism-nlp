The energy watchdog also confirmed it was tipped off about possible manipulation of the wholesale market on 17 October \u2013 more than three weeks before the energy secretary, Ed Davey, was told. Caroline Flint MP, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, who has already called for Ofgem to be scrapped for a tougher regulator, said the public was owed a proper explanation of what was going on. Ofgem and the Financial Services Authority are both currently investigating alleged price-fixing by traders working for energy companies or other investors, following claims by a whistleblower working for a price reporting agency. Ofgem confirmed yesterday that a report by the accounting firm BDO last year into improving reporting transparency had included a recommendation that Ofgem should \"require the reporting of trading function results\" by energy companies. In January, Ofgem said it was moving ahead with various initiatives to improve transparency, but that it was not going to implement the BDO's exact recommendation. The Consumer Focus watchdog warned of an accounting \"black hole\" if trading arm activity was left out. But Ofgem says the BDO proposal would not have alerted it to the problems identified by the whistleblower and it was justified in putting forward an amended version. \"Ofgem implemented the majority of our consultants BDO's recommendations.

Ofgem previously declined to say when it had first been told of the problems by the ICIS Heren PRA when asked by The Guardian. However, it has now confirmed the date as 17 October. It said it had been in the process of examining the material and chose, as an independent regulator, not to tell the secretary of state immediately until the Guardian went public with the information. An Ofgem spokesman said: \"As with all information that may have the potential to lead to enforcement action we do not routinely disclose details of our inquiries in order not to jeopardise any investigation or possible enforcement action.\" He added: \"We also have a duty under our whistle blower procedures to protect the confidentiality of details received where that has been requested.\" At a select committee hearing on Tuesday, Davey defended Ofgem's delay. \"If Ofgem were to knock on my door every time they had allegations of price-fixing, they would find I had other things to do,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "In October, Philip Stocken, a professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, clipped a newspaper article about Hewlett-Packard to show his accounting class. The Wall Street Journal article quoted Meg Whitman, Hewlett-Packard's newish CEO, explaining the company's difficult financial turnaround: \"She said HP for years didn't invest enough in research and development and failed to develop internal software systems that could provide her and other executives with necessary intelligence about how the business is performing.\" Stocken, an experienced accountant, summed up the gist of that paragraph to his students: HP appeared not to know the most basic building block of any company's financial statements: how much income its divisions were making. That's akin to being ignorant of the size of your own paycheck, but trying to pay your bills and run your life anyway. Stocken sums up his conclusion at the time: \"That's a red flag.\" On Tuesday, Hewlett-Packard announced that it would take an $8.8bn writedown on its acquisition of UK-based Autonomy, for which it paid over $11bn not long ago. HP alleges that Autonomy falsified its financial statements; if its allegations are true, it would then appear that neither HP's outside auditing firm, Ernst &amp;Young, nor Autonomy's firm, Deloitte, caught any mistakes.

Hughes, who appeared as a prosecution witness at Adoboli's trial and told Southwark crown court he \"cried all the way home\" on the night his colleague was arrested, said he began work creating the website shortly after leaving UBS. \"Obviously, I've been without a job,\" he said. \"I thought it [the website] was a good idea. My best mate is a professional footballer and he's invested in it.\" Hughes, who is described as the brains of the operation on the Bets of Mates website, said he could not \"pass comment on whether it's appropriate\" for a man so closely linked to Britain's biggest ever fraud loss to be running a betting site. \"It's not as though it's the first gambling website,\" he said. \"It's an appropriate use of my skills, hopefully. \"I appreciate there's a story here, but I don't want to be the one to tell it. Obviously the judge has made his comments on that [the role of gambling in Aboboli's fraud].\" Sentencing Adoboli earlier this week, Mr Justice Brian Keith told him there is \"a strong streak of the gambler in you. You were arrogant to think the bank's rules for traders did not apply to you.\" Hughes told the trial he was aware Aboboli was hiding his unauthorised trades in an \"umbrella\" account more than six months before the bank discovered the losses, but failed to report it. The court heard that after Adoboli told him how much money was in the account, Hughes sent a chat message to Adoboli saying: \"Nice. It can piss down with rain after this. You're a legend. I don't know how you sleep at night.\" He told the court he was \"stupid not to have reported Adoboli as soon as he became aware of the unauthorised trades. Hughes said he had to receive six weeks of counselling iafter Adoboli's arrest in September 2011. \"This was a huge trauma,\" he told the court. \"I nearly drove my car into the middle of the motorway. I wasn't a rational human being. I cried all the way home from London to Middlesbrough.\" On his profile page on the website, Hughes is described as \"a Middlesbrough fan by trade, but seven years in the City removed all sense of optimism from his character, and made him absurdly superstitious\". \"Having worked in the City since 2005 John is all numbers and spreadsheets, numbers and spreadsheets, numbers and spreadsheets,\" it adds. The website, which uses the slogan \"there is always a winner\", was set up by Hughes and two friends who had a \"drunken idea [to set up the gambling site while] watching the Champions League semi-final in 2012\". Hughes' partners are Adam Haywood, a business development manager, and Dave \"TY\" McGurk, a centre half for York City. \"I know a lot of professional footballers,\" Hughes said. \"The idea was they were going to promote it for me \u2026 but it doesn't look like I need them to now.\"",

The stock of Greek debt is simply too high \u2013 as a ratio of GDP, it is forecast to pass 190% in 2014 as recession takes its toll...</p> <p>The IMF got the correct remedy at the outset of these talks: it's time for so-called official lenders, which would include eurozone countries and the European Central Bank, to accept a haircut on their loans. That's the only way to achieve debt sustainability in Greece definitively...</p> <p>Unfortunately, next Monday (26 November) will probably produce some form of compromise that delays resolution for another year, when Germany's elections are out of the way.

      "bodyText": "Elsewhere in the struggling eurozone, Fitch has just downgraded Cyprus, another country struggling with the prospect of a bailout. The ratings agency has cut Cyprus from BB+ to BB-, pushing it further into junk territory, with the long term outlook remaining negative. Fitch cited a \"materially weaker macroeconomic outlook for Cyprus.\" The country is currently trying to negotiate a bailout with the troika, and has even apparently been sounding out Russia for help. And with that it's time to shut up shop again. Thanks for all the comments and we'll be back tomorrow. European markets have closed and despite the failure of the eurogroup to once again agree on Greece's aid programme, they have edged higher. Investors seem to be unsurprised (and who can blame them) and are awaiting the next meeting on Monday. Ahead of the EU summit on the latest budget proposals: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 0.07% higher at 5752.03 \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.16% \u2022 France's Cac has climbed 0.44% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is 0.82% better \u2022 Spain's Ibex has dded 0.34% \u2022 The Athens market is up 1.1% And in early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 48 points after some reasonable US data. Portuguese finance minister Vitor Gaspar has said Greece's lenders are close to a deal to get the country's debt down to a sustainable level, despite the failure of the latest talks to get the job done. Speaking alongside German counterpart Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, he said (as reported by Reuters): We are very close to an agreement about Greece and therefore that will be a very positive development, which is important for Greece, it is important for the euro area, it is important for Portugal and I dare to say it is important for Germany as well. So there we have it. We're close to a deal. Everyone says so, apart from those who say we're not. Start building up your hopes for Monday now. Or maybe not. The the Wall Street journal suggests Sch\u00e4uble changed his mind about a Greek deal at the vital moment: The European Central Bank has said it is satisfied with a plan to recapitalise Greece's banks. The \u20ac50bn proposal involves Greek lenders issuing new shares and convertible bonds, some of which could end up with a bailout-financed fund if private investors shy away. Despite some criticism the scheme was inadequate, the ECB welcomed the plan. As reported by Reuters, the bank said: The ECB considers the proposed pricing framework contains appropriate incentives to encourage Greek credit institutions to exit state support as soon as possible. There is more bad news for Greece, with Citigroup and Ikea both announcing they are cutting back their presence in the country. Our correspondent Helena Smith. After almost 50 years operating in Greece, Citi Bank today joined the growing list of foreign retailers and lenders who have either sharply reduced their presence or pulled out of the country altogether. The last major international bank with branches nationwide, Citi announced it would close all of its network presence outside of Greece\u2019s two major cities, Athens and Thessaloniki. The closure of some 16 branches will result in about 170 job losses, nearly a tenth of the lender\u2019s total workforce. Earlier this year French lenders Credit Agricole and Societe Generale pulled out of the crisis-hit country. Austerity-induced recession has also seen a host of foreign retailers leave Greece, including the supermarket giant Carrefore and Fnac. This week the UK-owned retailer Costa Coffee also closed its ten Greek stores. Following suit IKEA said it would be cutting wages at all of its outlets in Greece. My colleague Nils Pratley says the failure of the eurogroup and IMF to reach a deal on Greece is a disgrace. Here's a flavour of his comment: The basic problem is that the eurozone power group is groping for something that doesn't exist. It wants a financing package that is small enough to maintain the pretence that the last bailout arrangements are proceeding swimmingly; but the ministers also want to make Greek debt sustainable. It can't be done. The stock of Greek debt is simply too high \u2013 as a ratio of GDP, it is forecast to pass 190% in 2014 as recession takes its toll... The IMF got the correct remedy at the outset of these talks: it's time for so-called official lenders, which would include eurozone countries and the European Central Bank, to accept a haircut on their loans. That's the only way to achieve debt sustainability in Greece definitively... Unfortunately, next Monday (26 November) will probably produce some form of compromise that delays resolution for another year, when Germany's elections are out of the way. But the eurogroup is playing with fire. Every chapter of the eurozone crisis has carried a similar theme: when politicians don't present themselves as serious, markets react badly Finance ministers from France and the Netherlands have repeated that a writedown of Greek debt would be a bad precedent. By that, I suppose they are worried that it would open the floodgates to other countries demanding their own debts be reduced. And then there is this: Makes you wonder what the point of last night's session was then..... Ahead of tomorrow's summit to discuss the EU budget, employees of EU institutions are protesting in Brussels. They fear any cuts could lead to a deterioration in their pay and conditions. The placard reads: \"You can't always govern against the people.\" Here's a bit of news from earlier. Italian prime minister Mario Monti won a confidence vote in the lower house of parliament on its latest budget plan. The plan is central to Monti's efforts to cut Italy's deficit from 2.6% of output to 1.8% next year. The package, which faces further votes today, includes a 1% rise in the highest VAT rate to 22%. It can happen to anyone. There you are, Belgian prime minister Elio Di Rupo, giving a state of the union address in parliament. Suddenly your phone rings and interrupts the flow. Still, he seems to have recovered his poise quickly enough. Speculation that it was Angela Merkel about the EU budget is completely unfounded (he's smiling, after all.) Wall Street has opened higher after some reasonable US data, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up around 30 points. Manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in five months in November, according to Markit's preliminary purchasing managers index. It rose to 52.4 from 51 in October, boosted by domestic demand. And only a few respondents suggested the lift could have come from rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy. Earlier new jobless claims fell by 41,000 to 410,000 last week, but the level remained high, and this time Sandy was said to be part of the reason. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: Today's weekly claims data don't change the overall picture for the US labour market. Recent data have been more encouraging but November will be affected by the effects of the Hurricane Sandy. The Fed's Bernanke remained cautious on the development of the labour market at his speech in New York yesterday afternoon, suggesting that the 2 percentage point decline since the top of the crisis is definitely not enough. Although future policy steps are still unclear, Bernanke made crystal clear that Fed Funds will remain stable until the US economy is well into a solid recovery path. And the labour market will have to be much stronger than what seen in the past few months. As events have calmed down after a lively morning, it might be helpful to quickly recap the main developments today. \u2022 Yesterday's Eurogroup meeting broke up in the early hours of the morning without a deal over Greece's aid programme. Eurozone finance ministers and the IMF still couldn't agree how to get Greece's debts down to a sustainable level, meaning its long-delayed aid tranche still cannot be paid (see 6.59am onwards) \u2022 There is widespread anger and disappointment in Athens over the latest delay. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has led the chorus of criticism, saying there is no excuse for finance ministers and the IMF to still be divided over its bailout. Samaras declared (see 8.01am for more): Greece did what it had committed it would do . Our partners, together with the IMF, also have to do what they have taken on to do. Any technical difficulties in finding a technical solution do not justify any negligence or delays. Samaras was joined by other leaders, with Fotis Kouvelis of the Democratic Left insisting that Greece had met all its commitments (see1.51pm). However, opposition leader Alexis Tsipras delivered a damning criticism of Samaras and the eurogroup, insisting that the country must restructure its debts again (see 11.14am). And another MP argued that the latest delay simply humiliated Greece (see 7.20am). \u2022 Germany's Angela Merkel said she was still optimistic that an agreement would be reached when the eurogroup meets next week, but warned that this would not be enough to end the crisis (see 11.34am). She was herself blasted by the opposition (see here). Her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has revealed there was support for a \u20ac10bn plan to buy back Greek bonds (see 1.04pm). \u2022 At the heart of the crisis is the question of Greece's debt sustainability. A document obtained by Reuters around midnight showed that this can only be achieved by 2020 if eurozone governments take losses on their loans (see 7.32am). \u2022 City analysts agree -- arguing that without a debt restructuring Greece will never be saved. With the eurogroup due to meet again next Monday, the financial markets are hunkering down for another delay - but still hopeful that a deal will eventually be agreed. After all, the French finance minister reckons we just need a few 'final touches' (see 7.43am).. I'm going to scoot off now -- my colleague Nick Fletcher will see you home :). Cheers all, GW Lots of great comments below the line today, in my inbox, and on Twitter today. Here's just a few that caught my eye: James Wilkins of Thessaloniki, captures the anger in Greece today: The Eurozone crisis is about more than money. As an Englishman resident in Greece who has also spent 20 happy years working in Germany I feel ashamed of the mean-minded attitude of the German government. I have followed this torturous, never-ending crisis with increasing cynicism and disbelief. Whatever the Greeks do it is never good enough. He adds: Merkel says that the Euro is more than a currency, it is a symbol of freedom, democracy, free speech and probably a whole lot of other wonderful attributes. It is Angela\u2019s baby...and she insists it grow up in her image. But the Greeks are not Germans and they never will be. It should surprise no-one if there are \u2018troubles\u2019 in Greece, and if that happens who will put out the fire. Will Van Rompuy send in the Eurozone army? It is absolutely understandable that the Greeks are angry. And on Twitter, Spyros Gkelis also despairs: MontyBest argues that the eurogroup's failure could actually be a good thing for Athens, commenting that: I am happy that no agreement was reached, not because I wish more suffering for the poor Greeks who my heart goes out to, but in the hope that there will be a default... The Troika is like a cat with a mouse, tormenting then eventually killing its plaything While ballymichael flags up the political hurdles that leaders are struggling to overcome: Germany is in the middle of its budget ratification process, and Sch\u00e4uble yesterday was understandably being rhetorically kicked all around the Bundestag Chamber for not balancing the budget, even when the circumstances are so favourable, by the SPD and Greens. I'd say all the Finance Ministers of the AAA countries have the same problem. They have coalitions, that are getting very shaky, supporting Greece. An agreement by the EZ finance ministers, that doesn't then get through parliament would be far worse. And RomanWilson takes issue with Dimitris Papadimoulis's claim that Greece has been humiliated today (see 7.20am): Greece is being humiliated ever since George Papandreou took Greece right into the arms of the troika. Since then every nook and cranny of the entity 'Greece' has had the full glare of the spot light shone upon, and you're saying only now, are you, that Greece is being humiliated? Besides Mr Papadimoulis, if you think this humiliation is bad enough then you should wait for an even bigger one that's just round the corner: it is that of your party taking the reins of power and still having to ask of the Germans for yet more loans for Greece's new era with the drachma Fotis Kouvelis, the leader of Greece's Democratic Left party (the junior member of the coalition), has joined the ranks of Greeks criticising the eurogroup's performance at yesterday's meeting. Kouvelis declared that Greece's lenders and fellow eurozone countries should: immediately live up to their commitments. adding: Greece has taken all necessary measures One should point out that this occured despite Kouvelis'sparty abstaining on the parliamentary vote on Greece's austerity plans. While we're looking at Greece, a few pictures have arrived of opposition leader Alexis Tsipras giving a televised address attacking Samaras (see 11.14am for earlier details of his comments): Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is giving more details about Berlin's position on Greece. In the past few minutes the German finance minister has indicated that a programme to buy back some Greek bonds (thus cutting its total debts) could be worth \u20ac10bn. He also told reporters that the Bundestag could vote on the Greek programme on November 30 \u2013 four days after the Eurogroup is due to reconvene. In other words - Greece certainly won't get its aid tranche until December (it was originally due in September!) Sch\u00e4uble is also discussing the idea of lowering the interest payments on Greek debt. However, as Reuters' Luke Baker (who endured the overnight talks in Brussels) points out -- he is not embracing the idea of 'Official Sector Involvement' - ie, losses on Greek bonds. And as Marc Ostwald argued this morning (see 10.06am) without a default, Greece's debts will never be sustainable. The other looming crisis in Europe is the row over the EU budget, which will really kick off tomorrow when leaders gather for a two-day summit. UK prime minister David Cameron has already vowed to reject any real terms increase in the budget \u2013 but he won't be the only leader playing hardball. As Open Europe points out, another six countries have explicitly vowed to use their veto if they don't get their way. The Netherlands also wants the budget frozen, while Denmark wants its own veto - and France is unhappy about swathes of the proposals. This graph shows the divisions between Brussels and the UK (and also Germany). The two-day Summit begins on Thursday evening, but Brussels officials have already said it could run into Saturday if needed. Over in Spain, angry residents have begun burning piles of rubbish in the streets as a long-running row over austerity cutbacks threatens public health. From Madrid, Martin Roberts explains how a strike by refuse collectors has left around 3,000 tonnes of detritus in the streets. Angry residents of Jerez de la Frontera, which is world-famous for making sherry wine, have taken to the streets and faced riot police for two nights in a row to burn some of the estimated 3,000 tonnes rubbish which has piled up in the last three weeks since dustbin men went on strike to reject proposals to lay off 30% of them due to spending cuts by the town hall. Residents have also complained about nasty smells and rats running through the ordure-strewn streets, but officials have denied there is a health risk in the southwestern town. \u201cRubbish by itself doesn\u2019t lead to illnesses,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Rabad\u00e1n, health service chief for the province of C\u00e1diz, told local media. \u201cThere may well be a proliferation of rats, but rodents do not enter homes while there is rubbish around. Under normal conditions there are six or seven rats per person, but you don\u2019t see them. They run away.\u201d Norbert Barthle, a senior member of Angela Merkel's party, gave a clear insight into Berlin's fears over the eurocrisis this morning. Barthle, the CDU spokesman on budgetary affairs, told Deutschlandfunk radio that fresh debt reduction for Greece would be a terrible example to other struggling members of the eurozone - who would want to copy it! Barthle said a haircut would be: a fatal signal to Portugal, to Ireland and possibly to Spain. They would ask themselves straightaway, why should we ... push through tough measures that might lead to the government being voted out if our debts can be written off?\" And that, of course, would mean even higher losses for German taxpayers (as well as commercial lenders). Martin Koehring of the Economist Intelligence Unit has also argued this morning that eurozone leaders need to confront the unpalatable truth that Greece needs further debt relief to stand any chance of cutting its national debt to 120% of GDP by 2020. Koehring writes: Euro zone leaders continue to resist accepting a write-down on their loans to Greece, although it looks increasingly likely that this is the only way to reduce Greek debt to the 120% debt target that the IMF deems \"sustainable\" He adds that euro zone leaders will probably eventually agree on a deal to cut Greek debt substantially, to avoid Greece leaving the euro zone through mere 'technical disagreements'. But.... A much more likely cause for a Greek disorderly default and euro exit would be domestic political developments in Greece (highlighted by rising political instability and social unrest). However, our assessment remains that there is a 40% probability that Greece leaves the euro zone within the next five years.\u201d More developments in the political arena \u2013 Angela Merkel has told the Bundestag this morning that there is 'a chance' of a deal on Greece next Monday (yup, just a chance), and also warned that the eurozone crisis will rumble on for many more years. Merkel said: I believe there are chances, one doesn't know for sure, but there are chances to get a solution on Monday. But the longing for one act, one miracle solution, one truth that means all our problems are gone tomorrow ... this will not be fulfilled. What was neglected over years, over decades, cannot be taken care of overnight and therefore we will need to continue to move step by step. Merkel was taking part in a debate on the 2013 German budget, after opposition leader Peer Steinbr\u00fcck called for a delay while the immediate Greek deadlock was solved (see 10.57am). Greece's opposition leader, Alexis Tsipras, has been lambasting prime minister Antonis Samaras in Athens in the last few minutes. Tsipras, head of the Syriza party, told MPs that Samaras had failed to fight Greece's corner. Nick Malkoutzis of Kathimerini was watching the action, and reports: Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, head of Germany's opposition Social Democrats, has urged Angela Merkel to delay Germany's next budget until the uncertainty over Greece has been resolved. Steinbr\u00fcck (who could potentially form a grand coalition with Merkel after next autumn's elections) added that Greece will require assistance until the end of this decade. He also warned that German taxpayers will ultimately pay the price. Reuters has the news snaps, and now you do too: \u2022 GERMANY'S STEINBRUECK SAYS CLEAR THAT GREECE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RETURN TO CAPITAL MARKETS IN THIS DECADE \u2022 GERMANY'S STEINBRUECK SAYS MERKEL'S GOVERNMENT SHOULD PUSH BACK VOTE ON GERMAN BUDGET UNTIL THERE IS CLARITY ON GREECE \u2022 GERMANY'S STEINBRUECK SAYS CANNOT FILL GREEK FINANCING HOLE WITH MIX OF PIECEMEAL MEASURES Update It's been pointed out that Peer Steinbr\u00fcck is in fact the Social Democrat candidate for chancellor in the next election, not head of the party. Apologies. Looking back at the British economy, new public finance data released this morning was worse than expected. The UK government borrowed \u00a38.6bn to balance the books in October, up from \u00a35.9bn a year ago -- and much worse than the \u00a36bn shortfall pencilled in by economists. The shortfall was partly due to a tumble in corporation tax receipts, down more than 10%. As my colleague Julia Kollewe writes, the data shows that chancellor George Osborne will struggle to hit his deficit targets. Analyst Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities is on blunt form this morning, aghast at the eurogroup's failure to grasp the situation in Greece. Ostwald says: Once again one is stunned by the inability of all involved parties to face some key facts: a) Greece's problems are not related in any shape or form to its debt servicing costs, so any measures on this front are a case of 'fiddling while Athens burns'; b) Greece's problems are about its debt mountain, which is de facto not sustainable without a huge write-off that will have to include all Official Sector holdings and, preferably reduce the CURRENT outstanding debt to GDP ratio to 60% or at worst 80% - there are no other solutions other than outright default. This will not change today, on the November 26th or any other date, though the longer the various parties involved fail to face up to this reality, the higher the probability of a very disorderly default. Back to the Greek deadlock, and Angela Merkel has been attempting to reassure German MPs in a closed-door meeting. Dow Jones Newswires has a source on the inside, who reports that Merkel told lawmakers that a deal on a Greek debt buy-back and cuts to the interest rates on its loans was still possible. She also, apparently, said Germany could be willing to help boost the capital held by the European Financial Stability Facility by \u20ac10bn \u2013 to help fund a Greek bond-buyback. In the UK, the latest Bank of England minutes showed that one member of the MPC - David Miles - voted for an extra \u00a325bn of quantitative easing at this month's meeting. The other eight members, though, sat tight. The minutes also show that the MPC is pretty gloomy about the global economy, particularly the eurozone The recovery is likely to be subdued by historic standards, reflecting the broader causes and repercussions of the financial crisis. In particular, the need for rebalancing in the global economy \u2013 especially in the euro area \u2013 looked set to cast a long shadow over growth. You can read the full Minutes here (pdf). Antonis Samaras has now postponed a trip to Qatar, scheduled for next Monday, because the Eurogroup will be holding another meeting on Greece on that day. Spokesman Simos Kedikoglou told Reuters that: The prime minister will stay in Athens to coordinate things. The irony here is that Samaras had been planning to drum up investment from the Qataris, which could have helped the country return to growth (and meet the privatisation targets imposed by the Troika). Greek bank shares have fallen sharply in early trading, following the disappointment of the eurogroup meeting. Athens journalist Efthimia Efthimiou has the details: There's less reaction in other markets: FTSE 100: down 4 points at 5743, - 0.07% German DAX: down 15 points at 7157, -0.2% French CAC: down 12 points at 3349, -0.35% City experts, such as strategist Kit Juckes, are still hopeful of a deal next week: German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has raced back from the eurogroup meeting to speak to German MPs at the Bundestag. He's explaining the situation with Greece, and making it clear that there is still no consensus on two key issues. According to Sch\u00e4uble, eurogroup finance ministers and the IMF could not agree how to fill the \u20ac14bn shortfall in Athens' finances over the next two years. There was also disagreement on whether Greece had to achieve debt sustainability by 2020 or 2022. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has blasted eurozone finance ministers for failing to agree a deal on the country's bailout at last night's talks. In the face of public disappointment and criticism from opposition MPs (see 7.20am), Samaras there was no justification for the latest delay. In a punchy statement, Samaras said: Greece did what it had committed it would do . Our partners, together with the IMF, also have to do what they have taken on to do. Any technical difficulties in finding a technical solution do not justify any negligence or delays. (quotes via Reuters) Samaras must hope that the Greek public blame the eurogroup for the deadlock, rather than him. And the early reaction from Greece suggests that's how the citizens are reacting: France's finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, has claimed this morning that a deal on Greece really is close. Linda Yueh of Bloomberg has the quotes: While finance ministers were arguing last night, Reuters got their hands on a document prepared for the meeting. It showed that Greece's debts can only be cut to a sustainable level if eurozone countries accept losses on their loans to Athens, provide additional financing or force private creditors into selling Greek debt at a discount. The document outlined that other measures (such as cutting the interest rates on Greece's loans or buying debt from private investors) would not have enough impact on the country's debt pile. It said that either member states accept \"capital losses or budgetary implications\", or push back the target date for Greece's debts to fall to 120% of GDP by two years, to 2022. Eurozone countries are not, yet, prepared to accept the first option, while the second option is unacceptable to the IMF. Thus deadlock. A Greek opposition MP has hit out at the humiliation being heaped on the Athens government, following the Eurogroup's failure to agree a deal overnight. Dimitris Papadimoulis of the left-wing Syriza party declared: A new postponement. On Monday, they will a band aid until the German elections. The government is doing all their favors and is being humiliated in return. That's via Kathimerini, the Greek newspaper. It's deputy editor, Nick Malkoutzis, also questions whether Athens should change course. Germany's finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble also spoke to the press after the eurogroup meeting, saying: the questions are so complicated we didn't find a conclusive solution. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the Eurogroup, insisted this morning that the meeting in Brussels had not been fruitless. He told reporters: We are close to an agreement but technical verifications have to be undertaken, financial calculations have to be made and it's really for technical reasons that at this hour of the day it was not possible to do it in a proper way and so we are interrupting the meeting and reconvening next Monday. There are no major political disagreements. The Eurogroup also issued a formal statement from Juncker, in which he \"commended the considerable efforts made by the Greek authorities and citizens to reach this stage\", adding: Against this background, the Eurogroup has had an extensive discussion and made progress in identifying a consistent package of credible initiatives aimed at making a further substantial contribution to the sustainability of Greek government debt. The full statement is here (pdf) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. Greece's international lenders have failed to agree a deal over its bailout package, leaving the country's future in doubt again. After overnight negotiations in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund again admitted that they could not reach agreement on how to bring Greece's debts down to a sustainable level. Talks broke up around 3.30am GMT, with weary participants telling reporters that some progress had been made. Not enough, though. Instead, the eurogroup intends to meet again on November 26th for another go. News that the eurozone had flunked its Greek test, again, sent the euro sliding (down half a cent to $1.275). It has also sparked disappointment in Greece, after it met its side of the bargain by agreeing tough austerity plans. I'll be tracking all the news and reaction to this latest setback in the crisis through the day, along with other key events in the world economy.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "HP's figures reveal bigger problems than Autonomy | Charles Arthur", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Although the noise from HP on Tuesday was about the accusations against unnamed former managers at Autonomy, the real concern should be that the company which Silicon Valley once looked to as the engine of invention is spluttering. Ignore Autonomy; the figures that should really have HP's management and shareholders worried, from its fourth-quarter financial figures, begin with its PC division. \"Revenue was down 14% year over year with a 3.5% operating margin. Commercial revenue decreased 13%, and consumer revenue declined 16%. Total units were down 12% with both desktops and notebooks units down 12%.\" HP's PC business is the world's biggest, and its second-largest division (after services), bringing in revenues of $8.7bn in the past quarter. Yet HP is barely making any money on it \u2013 IDC estimates it shipped 13.94m computers, giving an average price of $620, on which it got total profits of $309m \u2013 just $22 per PC. \"I don't see how anyone could invest in this company any longer,\" ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall told Associated Press, describing it as \"an unmitigated train wreck\". Contrast that with Apple and Samsung, presently the two soaraway successes in the ferociously competitive mobile and tablet market: Apple's average selling price per iPhone is about $630, and its per-phone gross margin about 50%, according to court filings. Similarly, Apple shifted 14m iPads in the third quarter \u2013 a figure many thought disappointing, even though it outnumbers HP's PC figure \u2013 at an average $535 each. Samsung's telecoms division, which produces phones and tablets, recorded $5.12bn in profit in the third quarter, shipping 97.9m phones in total (of which 56.3m were the more valuable smartphone, such as its Galaxy range) and about 2m tablets. The lesson is clear: mobile devices are where the money is. It's also where the growth is. While the smartphone market is roaring ahead \u2013 growing 45% year-on-year \u2013 HP's 12% fall in PC shipments is substantially greater than the wider PC market: total shipments of Windows PCs worldwide fell by 9%. The dip is blamed on businesses and consumers waiting for the launch of Windows 8 (which came at the end of October), and the general economic climate in the US and Europe. Yet HP very recently had if not a lead, then at least a position in both the smartphone and tablet market. In July 2010 it bought Palm, which had been a pioneer in the smartphone market but fallen on unprofitable times, for $1.2bn to \"enhance HP's ability to participate more aggressively in the highly profitable, $100bn smartphone and connected mobile device markets\". Early in 2011 it announced a forthcoming range of smartphones and even a tablet \u2013 the TouchPad. But abruptly in August 2011, with the TouchPad having launched, it decided to kill off both tablet and smartphones (a fact it buried away in its announcement that it was \"in discussions\" to buy another company \u2013 Autonomy). HP took a $3.3bn writedown on the cost of the Palm acquisition and phone development. Meg Whitman, the chief executive, spoke vaguely about getting back into the smartphone market \u2013 but not before 2014. HP has a similar problem to Dell, whose woeful results last week point to long-term weakness for companies that aren't in the mobile market. Coming the day after the announcement that Intel's chief executive Paul Otellini will retire from leading the company which makes the central processing chips for the world's PCs \u2013 but not phones or tablets \u2013 it looks as though something deep is changing in the technology world. \"These issues have been brewing for a while,\" says Neil Mawston, executive director of the research company Strategy Analytics. \"HP and Dell have been struggling with the tablet market since 2010 [when Apple launched the iPad, triggering a huge shift in the business]. And this change has been picking up speed. But it hasn't come out of the blue.\" The change is that people are buying tablets rather than PCs, and both Dell and HP have ignored the consumer market, says Mawston. Dell's consumer division made a loss in the last quarter. And the gloom isn't over for HP. Remember its fabulously profitable printer inks, which cost more pro rate than champagne? \"Printing revenue declined 5% year over year with a 17.5% operating margin,\" says the results. \"Total hardware units were down 20% year over year. Commercial hardware units were down 15% year over year, and consumer hardware units were down 22% year over year.\" In other words, people aren't buying printers. Shipments of \"large format\" printers fell 5% in the third quarter, and HP's leading share was eroded there; more generally, we're printing fewer pages because the availability of smartphones and tablets means we don't have to carry paper around so much \u2013 something IDC noted as it recorded a fall in page printing in 2011 compared to 2010. \"HP's and Dell's problem is that they want to be IBM,\" Richard Windsor, a consultant and former equities analyst at Nomura, told the Guardian. \"Twenty years ago IBM was where HP is today. They decided that hardware was becoming commoditised and moved into software and services. Now they have steady margins and a good share price and an extremely well-run company. But it was a long haul, and HP is just at the beginning of that.\" Intel too is under threat, its fortunes tied to that of the PC business. Despite billions spent trying to build low-power chips, it has almost no presence in the smartphone business. Despite deals this year with Google-owned Motorola and China's Lenovo, it has less than 1% of the market, says Mawston, and despite its huge investment he doesn't see that growing beyond 8% by 2017.

      "body": "<p>Although the noise from HP on Tuesday was about the accusations against unnamed former managers at Autonomy, the real concern should be that the company which Silicon Valley once looked to as the engine of invention is spluttering.</p> <p>Ignore Autonomy; the figures that should really have HP's management and shareholders worried, from its <a href=\"http://h30261.www3.hp.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=71087&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1760639&amp;highlight=\" title=\"\">fourth-quarter financial figures</a>, begin with its PC division. \"Revenue was down 14% year over year with a 3.5% operating margin. Commercial revenue decreased 13%, and consumer revenue declined 16%. Total units were down 12% with both desktops and notebooks units down 12%.\"</p> <p>HP's PC business is the world's biggest, and its second-largest division (after services), bringing in revenues of $8.7bn in the past quarter. Yet HP is barely making any money on it \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS23730212\" title=\"\">IDC estimates</a> it shipped 13.94m computers, giving an average price of $620, on which it got total profits of $309m \u2013 just $22 per PC.</p> <p>\"I don't see how anyone could invest in this company any longer,\" ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall told Associated Press, describing it as \"an unmitigated train wreck\".</p> <p>Contrast that with Apple and Samsung, presently the two soaraway successes in the ferociously competitive mobile and tablet market: Apple's average selling price per iPhone is about $630, and its <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/07/26/us-apple-margins-idINBRE86P1NI20120726\" title=\"\">per-phone gross margin about 50%</a>, according to court filings. Similarly, Apple shifted 14m iPads in the third quarter \u2013 a figure many thought disappointing, even though it outnumbers HP's PC figure \u2013 at an average $535 each. Samsung's telecoms division, which produces phones and tablets, recorded $5.12bn in profit in the third quarter, shipping 97.9m phones in total (of which 56.3m were the more valuable smartphone, such as its Galaxy range) and about 2m tablets. The lesson is clear: mobile devices are where the money is.</p> <p>It's also where the growth is. While the smartphone market is roaring ahead \u2013 growing 45% year-on-year \u2013 HP's 12% fall in PC shipments is substantially greater than the wider PC market: total shipments of Windows PCs worldwide fell by 9%. The dip is blamed on businesses and consumers waiting for the launch of Windows 8 (which came at the end of October), and the general economic climate in the US and Europe.</p> <p>Yet HP very recently had if not a lead, then at least a position in both the smartphone and tablet market. In July 2010 it <a href=\"http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2010/100701xa.html\" title=\"\">bought Palm, which had been a pioneer in the smartphone market but fallen on unprofitable times, for $1.2bn</a> to \"enhance HP's ability to participate more aggressively in the highly profitable, $100bn smartphone and connected mobile device markets\". Early in 2011 it announced a forthcoming range of smartphones and even a tablet \u2013 the TouchPad.</p> <p>But abruptly in August 2011, with the TouchPad having launched, it decided to <a href=\"http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2011/110818b.html\" title=\"\">kill off both tablet and smartphones</a> (a fact it buried away in its announcement that it was \"in discussions\" to buy another company \u2013 Autonomy). HP took a $3.3bn writedown on the cost of the Palm acquisition and phone development. Meg Whitman, the chief executive, spoke vaguely about getting back into the smartphone market \u2013 but not before 2014.</p> <p>HP has a similar problem to Dell, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/nov/16/dell-revenues-slump-pc-tablet-smartphone\" title=\"\">woeful results last week</a> point to long-term weakness for companies that aren't in the mobile market. Coming the day after the announcement that Intel's chief executive Paul Otellini will retire from leading the company which makes the central processing chips for the world's PCs \u2013 but not phones or tablets \u2013 it looks as though something deep is changing in the technology world.</p> <p>\"These issues have been brewing for a while,\" says Neil Mawston, executive director of the research company Strategy Analytics. \"HP and Dell have been struggling with the tablet market since 2010 [when Apple launched the iPad, triggering a huge shift in the business]. And this change has been picking up speed. But it hasn't come out of the blue.\"</p> <p>The change is that people are buying tablets rather than PCs, and both Dell and HP have ignored the consumer market, says Mawston. Dell's consumer division made a loss in the last quarter.</p> <p>And the gloom isn't over for HP. Remember its fabulously profitable printer inks, which cost more pro rate than champagne? \"Printing revenue declined 5% year over year with a 17.5% operating margin,\" says the results. \"Total hardware units were down 20% year over year. Commercial hardware units were down 15% year over year, and consumer hardware units were down 22% year over year.\" In other words, people aren't buying printers. Shipments of \"large format\" printers <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS23790712\" title=\"\">fell 5% in the third quarter</a>, and HP's leading share was eroded there; more generally, we're printing fewer pages because the availability of smartphones and tablets means we don't have to carry paper around so much \u2013 something <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUK23754512\" title=\"\">IDC noted</a> as it recorded a fall in page printing in 2011 compared to 2010.</p> <p>\"HP's and Dell's problem is that they want to be IBM,\" Richard Windsor, a consultant and former equities analyst at Nomura, told the Guardian. \"Twenty years ago IBM was where HP is today. They decided that hardware was becoming commoditised and moved into software and services. Now they have steady margins and a good share price and an extremely well-run company. But it was a long haul, and HP is just at the beginning of that.\"</p> <p>Intel too is under threat, its fortunes tied to that of the PC business. Despite billions spent trying to build low-power chips, it has almost no presence in the smartphone business. Despite deals this year with Google-owned Motorola and China's Lenovo, it has less than 1% of the market, says Mawston, and despite its huge investment he doesn't see that growing beyond 8% by 2017. The rest belongs to chips using the low-power designs of ARM of Cambridge.</p> <p>Allied to its $8bn writedown only in August against its acquisition of the services company EDS, it starts to look as though HP simply isn't good at buying things. Writing on his own site, Windsor <a href=\"http://www.radiofreemobile.com/hpq-and-autonomy-caveat-emptor/\" title=\"\">was acerbic</a>: \"I view the mess surrounding Autonomy as the strongest signal yet that the board of HPQ is not fit for purpose.\" He thinks the question of whether HP's shareholders were \"duped\" is irrelevant; Meg Whitman, the current chief executive, was one of those who approved the purchase as a director: \"The management and directors of HPQ do not have what it takes to turn this company around.

And the impressive revamped Metro store in Regent Street shows that Tesco can move upmarket and do a very good job on selling stylish \"Food to Go\" and more upmarket brands (there was a particularly impressive cabinet for the \u00a310 meal deal on the Tesco Finest range).

Even so, the failure of the eurogroup and the International Monetary Fund to reach a deal on Greece's finances is disgraceful. The basic problem is that the eurozone power group is groping for something that doesn't exist. It wants a financing package that is small enough to maintain the pretence that the last bailout arrangements are proceeding swimmingly; but the ministers also want to make Greek debt sustainable. It can't be done. The stock of Greek debt is simply too high \u2013 as a ratio of GDP, it is forecast to pass 190% in 2014 as recession takes its toll. The measures under contemplation are essentially tweaks, such as an interest holiday and a \u20ac10bn voluntary buy-back at a discount of IOUs held by the private sector. Such actions would chip a few percentage points off the debt-to-GDP ratio but the tower of borrowings would still be daunting. Few people would believe seriously that Greece's debt ratio would fall to 120% by 2020, as originally envisaged, or even by 2022, as EU ministers are now prepared to accept. The IMF got the correct remedy at the outset of these talks: it's time for so-called official lenders, which would include eurozone countries and the European Central Bank, to accept a haircut on their loans. That's the only way to achieve debt sustainability in Greece definitively. The IMF's stance provoked an outbreak of heebie-jeebies among EU politicians, who complain variously that a debt write-off would be illegal and would encourage the electorates of Ireland, Spain and Portugal to expect similar relief. Well, yes, but the risk in failing to confront the Greek crisis is probably worse. As Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities puts it, there are no solutions other than outright default: \"This will not change today, on 26 November or any other date, though the longer the various parties involved fail to face up to this reality, the higher the probability of a very disorderly default.\" Unfortunately, next Monday (26 November) will probably produce some form of compromise that delays resolution for another year, when Germany's elections are out of the way. But the eurogroup is playing with fire. Every chapter of the eurozone crisis has carried a similar theme: when politicians don't present themselves as serious, markets react badly.",

The stock of Greek debt is simply too high \u2013 as a ratio of GDP, it is forecast to pass 190% in 2014 as recession takes its toll.</p> <p>The measures under contemplation are essentially tweaks, such as an interest holiday and a \u20ac10bn voluntary buy-back at a discount of IOUs held by the private sector. Such actions would chip a few percentage points off the debt-to-GDP ratio but the tower of borrowings would still be daunting. Few people would believe seriously that Greece's debt ratio would fall to 120% by 2020, as originally envisaged, or even by 2022, as EU ministers are now prepared to accept.</p> <p>The IMF got the correct remedy at the outset of these talks: it's time for so-called official lenders, which would include eurozone countries and the European Central Bank, to accept a haircut on their loans. That's the only way to achieve debt sustainability in Greece definitively.</p> <p>The IMF's stance provoked an outbreak of heebie-jeebies among EU politicians, who complain variously that a debt write-off would be illegal and would encourage the electorates of Ireland, Spain and Portugal to expect similar relief.</p> <p>Well, yes, but the risk in failing to confront the Greek crisis is probably worse. As Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities puts it, there are no solutions other than outright default: \"This will not change today, on 26 November or any other date, though the longer the various parties involved fail to face up to this reality, the higher the probability of a very disorderly default.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately, next Monday (26 November) will probably produce some form of compromise that delays resolution for another year, when Germany's elections are out of the way. But the eurogroup is playing with fire. Every chapter of the eurozone crisis has carried a similar theme: when politicians don't present themselves as serious, markets react badly.</p>",

The report argued that the economy had suffered little long-term damage since the financial crash, as shown by stronger levels of employment during the year and low rates of business insolvencies. But the committee remained split after the City economist David Miles, one of four non-bank members of the MPC, voted for an increase in QE of \u00a325bn, though he will likely take comfort from the widespread agreement that QE remained a key policy tool. \"Views differed over the exact impact of the MPC's asset purchases \u2026 A case could be made for a further easing in monetary conditions,\" the minutes said, noting that output could be expanded without stoking inflationary pressures already flowing into prices. The Bank of England has come under intense pressure to increase QE in the last year in response to a downturn in the economies fortunes. A fall back into recession last year sparked calls for a rapid expansion of government bond purchases by the central bank under the QE scheme. However, most committee members have preferred to delay a decision while a separate scheme, known as funding for lending, boosts the amount of loans on offer from high street banks. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said he was relieved that QE was put on hold. \"However the minutes show that the committee remains divided about the value of increasing QE in the future, and such a move cannot be excluded, but should not be considered unless new threats to the stability of the UK banking system emerge. \"We believe that more QE would increase longer term risks of bubbles, financial distortions, and higher inflation, while only marginally benefitting the UK economy.

      "bodyText": "There are two ways of looking at the latest disappointing figures for public borrowing. The simple explanation is that government policy is a failure, with austerity leading to lower levels of growth and diminished tax receipts. Britain is stuck in a vicious cycle of weak activity and high debt that is entirely of George Osborne's making. This is what Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, says. The other way of looking at the borrowing numbers is kinder to the chancellor. Britain, from this perspective, is a troubled country with banks that are both massive and enfeebled, and an over-dependence on two sectors \u2013 property and financial services \u2013 that have been badly hit by the recession. Recovery was always going to be slow even without the endless crisis in the eurozone, which has made the process of rebalancing the economy all the more difficult. This is Osborne's view. Yet whatever the cause, the borrowing figures present the chancellor with a big headache as he prepares for the autumn statement on 5 December. Borrowing in the first seven months of the financial year was \u00a35bn higher than in the same period of 2011-12, whereas Osborne's plans involve a fall for the whole of 2012-13 of \u00a31.5bn. It is always unwise to extrapolate trends, but it is clear that the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will announce slippage in the Treasury's fiscal plans when it reports on the day of the autumn statement. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said this would amount to \u00a313bn if there was no change in the trend for the rest of 2012-13. Having been persistently over-optimistic since it was set up in 2010, the OBR will probably also cut its predictions for future growth. As a result, it will take longer for the Treasury to reduce the structural part of the deficit, the part that will remain even when the economy has recovered fully from the recession. Osborne could, therefore, be faced with a position in which the OBR says that he is on course to miss at least one and perhaps both his fiscal targets \u2013 to balance within five years the current budget adjusted for the state of the economy, and to get national debt falling as a share of output by 2015-16. If that happens, the chancellor will face a choice: either to announce additional measures to reduce the deficit in order to convince the financial markets that he is serious about filling the black hole in the public finances. Or he can say that he has been blown off course by events outside his control and push back the deadlines for hitting his targets for a couple of years. The state of the economy (and the government's opinion poll ratings) means that it would be a brave chancellor who would go for more austerity at this stage. Instead, Osborne will make the best of a bad job with growth boosting infrastructure measures balanced by cuts in current spending, coupled with an embarrassing acceptance that it will take longer than expected to turn the public finances round. There are no good options, and self-evidently, the autumn statement will not be an easy occasion for the chancellor. Balls, on the other hand, will be looking forward to it with relish.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne, the chancellor, has urged the independent commission on banking standards to avoid \"tearing up\" the consensus on financial reform by pushing for a more radical separation of retail and investment banking. Appearing before the cross-party commission, chaired by the Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, Osborne firmly rejected the idea that the reforms proposed by Sir John Vickers to \"ringfence\" retail banking will fail to tackle the culture that led to the crisis. \"We have spent two years getting to this point \u2026 We are now on the verge of implementing ground-breaking legislation,\" he said on Wednesday. \"I don't think this is the moment to tear up everything that's been done over the last two years.\" Rather than questioning the Vickers reforms, the chancellor urged the committee instead to examine how bankers could adopt something akin to the ethical standards imposed on other professions. \"In the medical profession and the teaching profession, we expect certain standards, but which are administered by the profession,\" he said. Barclays, whose conduct in the Libor scandal prompted Downing Street to set up the commission on banking standards, has proposed a new professional body to police the ethics of finance workers. However, Osborne faced tough questioning on how, and how quickly, he will enforce the new structure on the crisis-hit financial sector. Lord Turnbull, a former permanent secretary to the Treasury, warned that the so-called \"enabling legislation\" tabled by the government to implement the ringfencing of banks' retail operations gave too little detail about how the new regime would work. \"You're not just asking us to buy a pig in a poke, you're just asking us to buy a poke \u2013 because there's not much pig in it at the moment,\" he said. The chancellor said it would be up to individual banks to decide what operations, in addition to customer banking, should sit inside the ringfence, which will enforce much stricter rules on how much capital they must hold. The committee also published an exchange of letters between its chairman, Andrew Tyrie, and the chancellor, in which Tyrie complained that the bill as tabled \"does not include much detail\" on how the Bank will use its new regulatory powers. \"I believe that further information at this stage would greatly assist in presentation and scrutiny of the policy, especially in respect of the definition of things which will fall either side of the ringfence,\" he said, in a letter sent to Osborne on 12 October. The chancellor responded by promising to offer parliament the opportunity to examine the secondary legislation spelling out the changes in more detail in the new year. Osborne insisted the government backed the argument of the Bank of England's executive director for financial stability, Andy Haldane, that operations inside the ringfence should be run completely separately from riskier investment banking, with distinct governance and risk management. But he said these specific demands could not be directly enshrined in legislation, because it would be a mistake to create a \"Maginot Line\", reflecting how banks operate in 2012, which could later be subverted, or become irrelevant, as the operation of the financial sector changed.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Retail tycoon Sir Philip Green, who owns the Topshop-to-BHS Arcadia group, has urged fellow retailers to stop moaning about the economic climate and get on with it. \"We've got to trade. I can't keep listening to all these people making it up as they go along,\" Green told Reuters on Wednesday, as his Arcadia chain reported flat sales for the last year. \"We've got to up our game. If we sit there and cry and put on my front window the Bank of England said X, it isn't going to help me take any money.\" Last week the Bank of England warned of a \"long and winding\" road to recovery, with years of sluggish growth and rising prices. Arcadia posted a 25% rise in profits before tax and one-off items to \u00a3166.9m for the year to 25 August as a drive to raise efficiency in stock management boosted margins. However, total sales were flat at \u00a32.68bn while like-for-like sales edged down 0.7% overall and fell 3.2% in the UK. Group like-for-like sales have inched up 0.7% in the first 10 weeks of the new financial year. For the seventh year running Green, who is based in Monaco, did not pay himself a dividend. In 2005 he received a \u00a31.2bn payment. In a slew of figures from retailers on Wednesday, Halfords suffered a 23% slump in first-half profits as the \"summer of sport\" and better weather in the second quarter were not enough to offset a poor start to the year. Sales in the first quarter were affected by bad weather but the retailer, which sells bicycles and car parts from more than 460 stores in the UK and Ireland and 260 Autocentres, said it made up much of the lost ground in the second quarter. Better weather coupled with the success of British cyclists such as Bradley Wiggins and Victoria Pendleton in the Tour de France and the London Olympics boosted sales of bikes and accessories. Halfords made a profit before tax and one-off items of \u00a341.9m in the 26 weeks to the end of September, down from \u00a354.7m a year ago. It stuck to its profit guidance of \u00a366m-\u00a370m for the full year. Fashion chain French Connection said UK and European store sales had improved thanks to more typically autumnal weather than last year, which has led to it selling more coats and knitwear. But it noted that the market remained inconsistent. Like-for-like revenues were flat during its third quarter, the 16 weeks to 20 November, following a 9.5% fall in the first half of the year. JD Sports said it remained on track to deliver full-year profits in line with expectations, although a lot depends on Christmas. Like-for-like sales growth in the UK picked up to 1.5% in the 16 weeks to 17 November from 1.1% in the 26 weeks to the end of July.",

If we sit there and cry and put on my front window the Bank of England said X, it isn't going to help me take any money.\"</p> <p>Last week the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/14/bank-of-england-quantitative-easing-growth?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Bank of England warned of a \"long and winding\" road to recovery</a>, with years of sluggish growth and rising prices.</p> <p>Arcadia posted a 25% rise in profits before tax and one-off items to \u00a3166.9m for the year to 25 August as a drive to raise efficiency in stock management boosted margins. However, total sales were flat at \u00a32.68bn while like-for-like sales edged down 0.7% overall and fell 3.2% in the UK. Group like-for-like sales have inched up 0.7% in the first 10 weeks of the new financial year.</p> <p>For the seventh year running Green, who is based in Monaco, did not pay himself a dividend. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/oct/21/executivesalaries.executivepay\" title=\"\">In 2005 he received a \u00a31.2bn payment</a>.</p> <p>In a slew of figures from retailers on Wednesday, Halfords suffered a 23% slump in first-half profits as the \"summer of sport\" and better weather in the second quarter were not enough to offset a poor start to the year.</p> <p>Sales in the first quarter were affected by bad weather but the retailer, which sells bicycles and car parts from more than 460 stores in the UK and Ireland and 260 Autocentres, said it made up much of the lost ground in the second quarter. Better weather coupled with the success of British cyclists such as Bradley Wiggins and Victoria Pendleton in the Tour de France and the London Olympics boosted sales of bikes and accessories.</p> <p>Halfords made a profit before tax and one-off items of \u00a341.9m in the 26 weeks to the end of September, down from \u00a354.7m a year ago. It stuck to its profit guidance of \u00a366m-\u00a370m for the full year.</p> <p>Fashion chain French Connection said UK and European store sales had improved thanks to more typically autumnal weather than last year, which has led to it selling more coats and knitwear. But it noted that the market remained inconsistent. Like-for-like revenues were flat during its third quarter, the 16 weeks to 20 November, following a 9.5% fall in the first half of the year.</p> <p>JD Sports said it remained on track to deliver full-year profits in line with expectations, although a lot depends on Christmas. Like-for-like sales growth in the UK picked up to 1.5% in the 16 weeks to 17 November from 1.1% in the 26 weeks to the end of July.</p>",
