      "body": "<p>Citigroup shareholders have rejected the bank's plan to pay its chief executive $15m (\u00a39.4m) for a year during which its shares fell by 44%.</p> <p>After a preliminary tally at the New York-based firm's annual meeting in Dallas, the bank said a majority of shareholders had voted against its compensation plans for chief executive Vikram Pandit. About 45% of the votes supported the plan, which Citigroup had argued would help attract and retain top talent.</p> <p>The vote was taken under the so-called \"say on pay\" legislation which was introduced in 2010 after the credit crisis. Since the law counts absentee votes as rejections, 55% disapproved of Citigroup bankers' pay.

      "bodyText": "Citigroup shareholders have rejected the bank's plan to pay its chief executive $15m (\u00a39.4m) for a year during which its shares fell by 44%. After a preliminary tally at the New York-based firm's annual meeting in Dallas, the bank said a majority of shareholders had voted against its compensation plans for chief executive Vikram Pandit. About 45% of the votes supported the plan, which Citigroup had argued would help attract and retain top talent. The vote was taken under the so-called \"say on pay\" legislation which was introduced in 2010 after the credit crisis. Since the law counts absentee votes as rejections, 55% disapproved of Citigroup bankers' pay. The company said 75% of votes were cast suggesting a significant number of large shareholders had voted against Pandit's pay deal. The vote is non-binding but the bank's chairman, Richard Parsons, said: \"The board of directors takes this matter seriously.\" The bank would look at a more formula-based method for setting top executives' pay, he said. This is believed to be the first rejection of a bank chief executive's pay package since the say on pay rules became effective. Shareholder consulting firms ISS Proxy Advisory Services and Glass Lewis had both criticised the award ahead of the meeting. \"Pandit's 2011 incentive pay and multiple retention awards are substantially discretionary in nature or lack rigorous goals to incentivise improvement in shareholder value,\" analysts for ISS wrote in their report. Pandit took over Citigroup in 2007, as the bank emerged from the financial crisis. The bank had borrowed $45bn from the US government during the crisis. He took a $1 salary and pledged to return the bank to sustained profitability. Earlier this month the bank announced it was paying Pandit a total of $14.9m including his first bonus since the bank's collapse. Under a separate agreement Pandit also has a retention package under which he stands to collect about $40m, assuming the bank's earnings meet analysts' estimates. Citigroup's shares are up this year but fell 44% over 2011, the year for which the award was made. This week the bank announced it had made $2.9bn in the first three months of the year as business from international clients picked up and more customers paid back loans on time. Revenues were $19.4bn, down 2% from the same quarter a year ago.",

High Street bakery chain Greggs and the National Association of Master Bakers have organised the event on 26 April to protest against the proposed 20% VAT on hot foods, including pasties. Hundreds are expected to take part in the march, which will start at Pudding Lane and finish at Downing Street with the delivery of a petition against the plans, a spokeswoman for Greggs said. George Osborne, the chancellor, announced the tax in last month's budget, saying it would bring bakeries and supermarkets selling hot food in line with fast-food outlets which already pay VAT. But the government has since faced concerted opposition to the measure, with a group of Cornish MPs announcing last week that they were looking to build a pact with Labour MPs and others from across the country to oppose the measure. The chief executive of Greggs, Ken McMeikan, told the Guardian's Northerner Blog: \"If the chancellor does not reconsider his proposals, there could be huge repercussions for the entire bakery industry.\"",

In addition, for the year to the end of January 2012, Wolfson earned \u00a31.49m in salary, annual bonus and benefits, down from \u00a31.76m during the previous period. Meanwhile, Next's remuneration committee has also watered down the group's share matching plan, that was launched with much fanfare two years ago to replace Next's private equity-style pay schemes that never actually paid out. Under the share matching scheme, executives will no longer be able to spend their entire cash bonus buying shares, instead being limited to between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3125,000. Also, the company will now only give executives one share, instead of two, for every share acquired, while performance thresholds have increased.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has admitted it scored an embarrassing own goal after buying blunders left it with major shortages of coats, knitwear, printed blouses and even ballet pumps. Britain's biggest clothing retailer said it had not only been caught short by the cold snap in February which sparked a late run on winter coats and woollens but had failed to buy enough stock in hot trends such as tribal print fabrics and coloured chinos. Chief executive Marc Bolland said M&amp;S sold 100,000 cardigans and jumpers from its core M&amp;S Woman collection in the fourth quarter \u2013 but could have sold three times that number. \"That was a miss,\" he said, blaming a temporary buying issue. Women's ballet pumps, he added, could have sold at double the quantity. The stock shortages meant like-for-like clothing and homewares sales at M&amp;S fell 2.8% in the fourth quarter, missing City forecasts. While sales of lingerie and childrenswear held up, the patchy performance of its important women's division depressed the retailer's overall growth in the fourth quarter, with its shares the second biggest faller in the FTSE 100, closing down more than 2% at 358.7p. Bolland also blamed the deflationary impact of stocking more low-priced clothing lines, but insisted the weakness was not down to having the wrong fashions in its shops - just not enough stock of the right ones. \"We were bang on trend,\" he said. With much of M&amp;S's knitwear made in Asia, the retailer was unable to repeat orders fast enough to meet the demand sparked by the cold weather. The length of its lead times meant it missed the opportunity to sell another 25,000 coats and jackets, he said. \"There is no supply chain issue but we were too tight on bestselling lines,\" said Bolland, adding the fashion team headed by clothing supremo Kate Bostock \"had all my confidence\" but would nonetheless be strengthened. There have been recent personnel changes including last month's departure of Bostock's number two Andrew Skinner who had been at M&amp;S for 28 years and was responsible for stock management. Staff who plan the clothing ranges will also work more closely with its marketers: adverts featuring models such as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley caught shoppers' imagination but again M&amp;S misfired by underestimating demand for the products featured. Investec analyst Bethany Hocking said the trading figures were weak and cost-cutting seemed to have saved the day. Despite the sales shortfall M&amp;S expects to meet City's expectations of annual profits of \u00a3694m in the year to 31 March. \"The only good news\", Hocking added, was the \u00a3100m cut from its three-year stores refurbishment programme to \u00a3500m. It has refurbished around 70 of its 731 stores to date with the new look well received by shoppers, Bolland said. M&amp;S's food business proved less accident-prone with like-for-like sales ahead 1% in the 13 weeks to 31 March. Bolland said customers had responded to its promotions, which included a Valentine's Day special \"dine in for \u00a320\" offer. Taken together, food and general merchandise like-for-like sales finished down 0.7%. Internet sales jumped nearly 23% as it made changes to its website and added a discount M&amp;S Outlet section. There was also a chequered performance by its international business. Bolland said M&amp;S was enjoying \"double-digit\" growth in India and China but sales in the bailed out economies of Ireland and Greece had been hit as consumers cut back. Knit wits Marc Bolland reckons he could have sold three times as many cardigans and jumpers had it not been for the M&amp;S buying blip. He has a point. Knitwear is having its moment in the fashion sun. Between last year's Sarah Lund jumper frenzy and Jonathan Saunders' catwalk show last September, the humble pullover was elevated to \"It\" status. Fashion editors on the front row ditched their silk blouses in favour of boxy ribbed jumpers, and knitwear was no longer the sideshow, but the main event. M&amp;S could have capitalised on this in two ways. First, it sells excellent, well-priced cashmere and lambswool jumpers that are ripe for styling up into high fashion territory. In autumn, one oft sighted berry-coloured angora jumper could easily have swapped its M&amp;S label for an Acne one in fashion circles and no-one would have noticed. Second, the M&amp;S knitwear collection is vast. It boasts everything from sleeveless gilets to long-line cardigans to knitted T-shirts. With customers becoming increasingly confident in layering knitwear \u2013 witness the popularity of the long-line mannish cardigan worn over a cashmere T-shirt and the sleeveless cardigan as an alternative jacket \u2013 this should have been M&amp;S's woolly moment.

      "bodyText": "A jump in the price of food and clothing compared with a year ago pushed up inflation to 3.5% in March, according to official figures. The rise was expected by City analysts who said it was likely to prove a blip in a long-term decline over the rest of the year to nearer the Bank of England target of 2%. But the rise will put pressure on the government, which needs inflation to fall to ease growing pressures on household budgets. While inflation had been falling steadily since September, it remains higher than rises in average earnings and is blamed for undermining consumer confidence. In a further blow to the government, the Bank's interest rate setting committee is likely to view the figures as a good reason to hold back on another round of printing electronic money, known as quantitative easing. The Office for National Statistics said lower gas and electricity bills and a slower rise in petrol prices than last year failed to offset higher price tags for clothing and food to push up the consumer prices index (CPI) from 3.4% in February. Retail price inflation, which is often used as a benchmark for wage deals, inched lower to 3.6%, its lowest since December 2009. Figures from the British Retail Consortium earlier this month had shown that food prices posted their biggest increase since August 2010. The Bank of England and the Treasury's fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, expect the CPI measure of inflation to fall over the year, partly as a reaction to lower commodity costs, including foodstuffs. But a drought across most of England risks pushing up fresh food prices even further, while petrol prices remain near a record high. Figures at the end of last week showed factory gate inflation was higher than expected in March, though firms' raw material costs rose at their weakest pace in more than two years. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics said she expected slightly lower oil prices since the end of March to help inflation fall in April. \"Core price pressures will ease further as the economic recovery loses momentum again,\" she said. Chris Williamson, chief UK economist at financial data provider Markit, warned that without a rapid fall in inflation, the recovery would be slow. \"The combination of stubbornly high inflation and low wage growth may well continue to squeeze consumer spending in coming months, limiting any likely boost to spending arising from events such as the Olympics and Diamond Jubilee and acting as a drag on the recovery. With average pay growing at a rate of just 1.4% per annum, these inflation numbers mean pay is falling by 2.1% per annum in real terms.\" Separate figures published by the ONS showed UK house prices rose 0.2% in February, taking the annual rate to 0.3%. The average price of a home stood at \u00a3224,473. The ONS said the annual increase was driven by rises in London and the south-east. Prices for first-time home buyers were 1.3% higher on average than a year ago.",

    "webTitle": "IMF: Global economic recovery fragile and risk of relapse high", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund warned today that the European debt crisis could flare up again at any time and send the global economy back into deep recession. Olivier Blanchard, the Fund's chief economist, said there was currently \"an uneasy calm\" following the tensions in financial markets at the end of 2011, with hopes of a gradual recovery dependent on keeping the single currency in one piece. The IMF also gave the Bank of England the all-clear to add to its \u00a3325bn programme of quantitative easing if the UK economy struggles to recover from its longest and deepest recession of the post-war era. The Fund said that there was a risk of a 1930's style slump. \"In the current environment of limited policy room, there is also the possibility that several adverse shocks could interact to produce a major slump reminiscent of the 1930s.\" Asked about the risks that a country would leave the euro, Blanchard said: \"We are doing everything possible so that this does not happen.\" The IMF's chief economist said membership of the single currency made it harder for countries to become more competitive, but added: \"For the moment there is no plan B. The costs of one country leaving the euro unilaterally would be very big and would lead to a very large drop in output.\" Blanchard said there would be contagion risks if one country departed from the single currency, and said this would be one of the circumstances in which the firewalls would be needed. There would be knock-on pressure on the sovereign bonds of other nations, he said. At a press conference to mark the publication of the IMF's flagship World Economic Outlook, Blanchard, said: \"In the fall, a simmering European crisis became acute, threatening another Lehman size event, and the end of the recovery. \"Strong policy measures were taken, new governments came to power in Italy and Spain, the European Union adopted a tough fiscal pact, and the European Central Bank injected badly needed liquidity. Things have quieted down since, but an uneasy calm remains. At any time, things could get bad again.\" He added: \"The main risk remains that of another acute crisis in Europe. The building of the 'firewalls', when it is completed, will represent major progress. By themselves, however, firewalls cannot solve the difficult fiscal, competitiveness, and growth issues that some of these countries face. Bad news on the macroeconomic or political front still carries the risk of triggering the type of dynamics we saw last fall.\" \"Further measures must be taken to decrease the links between sovereigns and banks, from common deposit insurance, to common regulation and supervision. Now that the fiscal pact has been introduced, Euro countries should also explore the scope for issuing common sovereign bonds.\" In the absence of a euro meltdown, the IMF predicted that weak recovery was likely to resume in developed countries \u2014 including the UK \u2014 and to remain relatively solid in emerging nations. Global growth was projected to drop from 3.9% in 2011 to 3.5% before rebounding to 4.1% in 2013. At the turn of the year, the Fund had feared a more pronounced drop in global growth as a result of the debt crisis in the eurozone but has now revised up its forecasts modestly for all regions. The IMF said it expected growth in the UK to be 0.8%, little changed on the 0.7% recorded in 2011 but slightly higher than the 0.6% the Fund had pencilled in for 2012 three months ago. It left the 2013 forecast unchanged at 2%. Noting that Britain's financial sector had been hard hit by the financial crisis, the Fund said activity would be weak in early 2012 before recovering. The Office for National Statistics will next week publish its first estimate for gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2012, with the City forecasting a small increase in activity. \"In the United Kingdom, with inflation expected to fall below the 2% target amid weaker growth and commodity prices, the Bank of England can further ease its monetary policy stance,\" the Fund said. The eurozone is still expected to suffer a mild recession in 2012, with output falling by 0.3% and the outlook for Spain \u2013 the current cause for concern in financial markets - is now thought to be worse than it was three months ago. \"Because of the problems in Europe, activity will continue to disappoint in the advanced economies as a group\", the WEO said, \"expanding by only about 1.5% in 2012 and by 2% in 2013. \"Job creation in these economies will likely remain sluggish, and the unemployed will need further income support and help with skills, retraining, and job searching.\" The IMF said the most immediate concern was a further escalation of the euro area crisis leading to a \"generalised flight from risk\". This, the Fund added could see output in the euro area fall by 3.5% over two years, with knock-on consequences for the world economy, which would see activity decline by 2% over the same period. With most eurozone countries now subject to tough deficit-reduction plans, the IMF warned: \"Austerity alone cannot treat the economic malaise in the major advanced economies.\" It added that \"sufficient fiscal consolidation\" was taking place in Europe and said plans should be structured \"to avoid an excessive decline in demand in the near term.\" The US, Canada and Japan are expected to be the fastest growing of the leading G7 industrial nations this year, with growth of around 2%. China's growth rate, which dropped from 10.2% in 2010 to 9.2% last year is expected to ease further to 8.2% in 2012. Sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to keep up its recent 5%-plus growth rate. The Fund said the low levels of domestic inflation meant there was scope for further action by central banks and said policy makers should guard against overplaying the risks related to unconventional monetary support. \"While unconventional policies cannot substitute for fundamental reform, they can limit the risk of another major economy falling into a debt-deflation trap, which could seriously hurt prospects for better policies and higher global growth\".",

Things have quieted down since, but an uneasy calm remains. At any time, things could get bad again.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The main risk remains that of another acute crisis in Europe. The building of the 'firewalls', when it is completed, will represent major progress. By themselves, however, firewalls cannot solve the difficult fiscal, competitiveness, and growth issues that some of these countries face. Bad news on the macroeconomic or political front still carries the risk of triggering the type of dynamics we saw last fall.\"</p> <p>\"Further measures must be taken to decrease the links between sovereigns and banks, from common deposit insurance, to common regulation and supervision. Now that the fiscal pact has been introduced, Euro countries should also explore the scope for issuing common sovereign bonds.\"</p> <p>In the absence of a euro meltdown, the IMF predicted that weak recovery was likely to resume in developed countries \u2014 including the UK \u2014 and to remain relatively solid in emerging nations.</p> <p>Global growth was projected to drop from 3.9% in 2011 to 3.5% before rebounding to 4.1% in 2013. At the turn of the year, the Fund had feared a more pronounced drop in global growth as a result of the debt crisis in the eurozone but has now revised up its forecasts modestly for all regions.</p> <p>The IMF said it expected growth in the UK to be 0.8%, little changed on the 0.7% recorded in 2011 but slightly higher than the 0.6% the Fund had pencilled in for 2012 three months ago. It left the 2013 forecast unchanged at 2%.</p> <p>Noting that Britain's financial sector had been hard hit by the financial crisis, the Fund said activity would be weak in early 2012 before recovering. The Office for National Statistics will next week publish its first estimate for gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2012, with the City forecasting a small increase in activity.</p> <p>\"In the United Kingdom, with inflation expected to fall below the 2% target amid weaker growth and commodity prices, the Bank of England can further ease its monetary policy stance,\" the Fund said.</p> <p>The eurozone is still expected to suffer a mild recession in 2012, with output falling by 0.3% and the outlook for Spain \u2013 the current cause for concern in financial markets - is now thought to be worse than it was three months ago.</p> <p>\"Because of the problems in Europe, activity will continue to disappoint in the advanced economies as a group\", the WEO said, \"expanding by only about 1.5% in 2012 and by 2% in 2013.</p> <p>\"Job creation in these economies will likely remain sluggish, and the unemployed will need further income support and help with skills, retraining, and job searching.\"</p> <p>The IMF said the most immediate concern was a further escalation of the euro area crisis leading to a \"generalised flight from risk\".</p> <p>This, the Fund added could see output in the euro area fall by 3.5% over two years, with knock-on consequences for the world economy, which would see activity decline by 2% over the same period.</p> <p>With most eurozone countries now subject to tough deficit-reduction plans, the IMF warned: \"Austerity alone cannot treat the economic malaise in the major advanced economies.\"</p> <p>It added that \"sufficient fiscal consolidation\" was taking place in Europe and said plans should be structured \"to avoid an excessive decline in demand in the near term.\"</p> <p>The US, Canada and Japan are expected to be the fastest growing of the leading G7 industrial nations this year, with growth of around 2%. China's growth rate, which dropped from 10.2% in 2010 to 9.2% last year is expected to ease further to 8.2% in 2012. Sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to keep up its recent 5%-plus growth rate.</p> <p>The Fund said the low levels of domestic inflation meant there was scope for further action by central banks and said policy makers should guard against overplaying the risks related to unconventional monetary support.</p> <p>\"While unconventional policies cannot substitute for fundamental reform, they can limit the risk of another major economy falling into a debt-deflation trap, which could seriously hurt prospects for better policies and higher global growth\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "If the financial markets are right and Spain is on course to become the fourth member of the eurozone to need a bailout, the government in Madrid should hope that the International Monetary Fund rather than the European Union or the European Central Bank calls the shots. That is the conclusion from reading the Fund's half-yearly analysis of the state of the world economy published on Tuesday \u2013 a sombre, downbeat document that urges policy makers to go easy on the austerity. The World Economic Outlook chimes with reports from Athens, Lisbon and Dublin that when officials from the so-called troika (the IMF, the ECB and the EU) arrive in town for negotiations, it is the team from Washington that takes the least aggressive line. While making the case for countries taking medium and long term action to put their public finances in order, the WEO makes it clear that this should not be at the expense of doing short-term damage to fragile economies. And in what looks like a sideswipe at the hardliners in Europe intent on imposing draconian conditions in return for financial support, the Fund states baldly: \"Austerity alone cannot treat the economic malaise in the major advanced economies.\" The tone is more Ed Balls than George Osborne. Although the IMF is concerned about high and rising debt levels in the developed world, it is even more worried about the prospect of a debt-deflation vortex in the eurozone leading to a fragmentation of the single currency, leading to an even bigger downturn in the global economy than seen in the six months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. As such, it believes countries with the ability to raise public spending or cut taxes without damaging market confidence should do so. That means Germany, but the Fund refrains from naming names. It also says central banks have the scope for more \"unconventional measures\" in the event that growth does not pick up over the coming months. After Tuesday's unexpected pick-up in UK inflation, the City was betting against a further dose of quantitative easing from the Bank of England when its current \u00a350bn money-creation programme is completed next month, but the Fund said Threadneedle Street should have no hesitation in announcing a further package of asset sales if necessary. The WEO bears the stamp of the Fund's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, who was brought in by the former managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, just as Lehman was going belly-up in September 2008. Blanchard is a fan of John Maynard Keynes and it shows: worry first about growth, then the deficit; use aggressive monetary policy to drive down short-term and long-term interest rates; deflation not inflation is a bigger risk; austerity can be self-defeating. Blanchard is, of course, only in charge of one part of the Fund, and it would be naive to imagine that the orthodox thinking that characterised the institution's Washington consensus period has disappeared entirely. It hasn't, and there are some Fund-watchers who say the views of those in charge of the individual country programmes pay scant attention to what Blanchard says when they are deciding the terms on which financial support will be given. That, though, seems harsh. The Fund got its analysis spectacularly wrong in the years leading up to the crash. It was wedded to neo-liberal economics, slavishly devoted to the idea that de-regulating financial markets was always beneficial, and \u2013 as it has itself admitted \u2013 riddled with \"groupthink\". The crisis has led to a change of outlook \u2013 and it is a change for the better.",

      "bodyText": "Profits at Goldman Sachs fell to $2.1bn in the first quarter of 2012, 23% lower than the first quarter of 2011. But the bank beat expectations as trading bounced back. Goldman's revenue fell to $9.95bn, down from $11.89bn in the year-ago period. This quarter has been overshadowed by the resignation of former Goldman executive director Greg Smith. Smith resigned with an editorial in the New York Times that accused the bank of putting its profits before its clients. The firm's revenue from fixed income, currency and commodity trading totalled $3.46bn, more than double the figure the firm reported in the fourth quarter of 2011 but still 20% down from the same quarter last year. Investment-banking revenue was down 9.1% for the year at $1.15bn, but was a 35% improvement on the fourth quarter of 2011. \"Because client activity remains relatively low in certain areas, especially in parts of investment banking, we believe that our mix of businesses gives the firm significant room for revenue growth as economic and market conditions continue to improve,\" chief executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement. Later this month Blankfein will face shareholders at the company's annual meeting where Smith's comments are likely to provoke debate. Last year dissident shareholders criticised the bank's culture and the pay packages of its senior staff. The bank announced it had set aside $4.38bn for the first quarter of 2012 for compensation and bonuses, a 16% decline compared with the first quarter of 2011. Last week the bank revealed that Blankfein had received a total of $16.2m in pay and stock awards in 2011, down from $19m in 2010. Goldman's results follow those of rival JP Morgan Chase, which revealed a surprise increase in revenue to $27.4bn even as legal bills and debt pinched first-quarter earnings. The bank's investment banking revenue rose 68% quarter-on-quarter. JP Morgan reported a profit of $5.38bn for the first three months of 2012, down from $5.56bn a year earlier. The latest quarter included a loss tied to litigation expenses and changes in the value of the bank's debt. \u2022 This article has been amended. It originally stated that Goldman's earnings fell 23% in the first quarter. This has now been changed.",

It had seemed very possible that consumer price inflation would be down to the Bank's target level of 2% by the end of 2012 due to the waning impact of sharply rising oil, commodity and food prices in late-2010/early-2011, and by underlying price pressures being diluted by weak economic activity and elevated unemployment.
