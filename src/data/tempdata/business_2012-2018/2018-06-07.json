      "bodyText": "The TSB chief executive is under mounting pressure to quit after MPs said the bank\u2019s board should give \u201cserious consideration as to whether his position was sustainable\u201d. The Treasury select committee said Paul Pester had \u201cnot been straight with\u201d MPs and customers about TSB\u2019s recent IT meltdown, and that the bank\u2019s public communications had often been \u201ccomplacent and misleading\u201d. The MPs said they had lost confidence in his ability to provide a full assessment of the problems and deal with them in the best interests of customers. However, hours later, the bank rebuffed the apparent call for Pester to step down, saying that he continued to have the full support of the board. The letter from Nicky Morgan, chair of the select committee, to Richard Meddings, chairman of TSB, came 24 hours after Pester had a bruising encounter with MPs, some of whom suggested he should consider quitting. Shortly before Pester\u2019s appearance before the committee, the Financial Conduct Authority launched a stinging attack on him over the bank\u2019s failure to be open and transparent with customers when a botched IT upgrade locked up to 1.9 million people out of their accounts. The FCA accused him of \u201cportraying an optimistic view\u201d of services after the botched upgrade in late April. More than six weeks later some TSB customers are still facing disruption to services, and at the committee hearing on Wednesday it emerged that 1,300 customers had had money stolen from their accounts \u2013 in some cases their life savings \u2013 by fraudsters exploiting the meltdown. The letter to Meddings stated: \u201cThe committee considers that the TSB board should give serious consideration as to whether Dr Pester\u2019s position as chief executive of TSB is sustainable. \u201cThe committee has lost confidence in his ability to provide a full and frank assessment of the problems at TSB, and to deal with them in the best interests of its customers. \u201cIt is concerned that, if he continues in his position, this could damage trust not only in TSB, but in the retail banking sector as a whole. I ask that the board consider the committee\u2019s view as a matter of urgency.\u201d Commenting on the correspondence, Morgan said that from the time the IT problems at TSB had begun the bank\u2019s public communications had \u201coften been complacent and misleading\u201d. She added: \u201cThis tone has been set from the top \u2013 by Paul Pester \u2013 and whether intentionally or not he has not been straight with the committee and TSB customers. Dr Pester\u2019s statements that \u2018everything is running smoothly for the vast majority of our \u2026 customers\u2019 and that \u2018there will be no barriers\u2019 to customers switching accounts, and his denial that there were problems on TSB\u2019s fraud reporting line, are all examples of this. \u201cThe Treasury committee, therefore, has lost confidence in Dr Pester\u2019s position as chief executive of TSB, and considers that the TSB board should give serious consideration as to whether his position is sustainable.\u201d During often heated exchanges with MPs on the select committee during Wednesday afternoon, Pester and two other executives, Meddings, and Miquel Montes, chief operations officer of the Spanish parent company, Sabadell, were asked, \u201cwhy are you still in your job?\u201d and \u201ccan we be certain that some heads are going to roll?\u201d The Labour MP John Mann asked Pester: \u201cWill you fall on your sword before you\u2019re pushed?\u201d The chief executive responded: \u201cI believe I\u2019m the right person to fix this problem for our customers.\u201d Morgan has also written to Andrew Bailey, the FCA chief executive, and Sam Woods, chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority. Up to 1.9 million of TSB\u2019s 5.2 million customers began experiencing problems with online and mobile banking services on 23 April after accounts were migrated from an IT system inherited from the previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group, to Sabadell\u2019s technology operation. In a reply to Morgan, Meddings said the bank had \u201cmade good progress in resolving the recent IT issues, and TSB is now functioning at, or close to, normal for the majority of TSB customers\u201d. He said: \u201cWe recognise that we still have areas where we need to improve performance for our customers, and we do not underestimate these remaining issues. The important point is that this progress has been achieved under the leadership of Paul Pester, who continues to have the full support of the TSB board.\u201d Meddings said the board believed that communications since the upgrade had been made in good faith and based on the information available at the time.",

This is a company that reported an operating profit of \u00a319.8m in the UK and Ireland in the financial year to January and would be better placed to attempt reinvention if had not accumulated so much debt \u2013 \u00a3390m at the last count. Last year, \u00a318.7m was spent on interest payments. Staff whose jobs are on the line are entitled to be angry. Many factors explain HoF\u2019s distress \u2013 soaring business rates, the rise of internet shopping and the squeeze on disposable incomes \u2013 but management failure over many years is also high on the list. Not every retailer finds itself in the same mess. HoF, currently under the remote control of Chinese group Nanjing Cenbest, looks to have been overborrowed, undermanaged and short on long-term ideas. In the circumstances, you can understand why some landlords are also fuming about HoF\u2019s company voluntary arrangement (CVA), the means by which the group is trying to escape its full rental obligations and emerge as a smaller business. The British Property Federation, the landlord industry group, did not directly accuse HoF of abusing the process but the timing of its call for a government review of CVAs to prevent \u201cmisuse\u201d was probably not a coincidence. In one respect, landlords have only themselves to blame on CVAs. In the go-go years, they locked tenants into long leases with inflexible upward-only rent clauses. Now the retailing winds have changed direction and the country requires fewer shops, landlords cannot be shocked at the results. Rents are resettling at lower levels and CVAs can be viewed as just a fast form of adjustment. Yet the landlords make a fair point when they say the CVA lark can lack basic fairness. As originally conceived, CVAs were meant to be used as a last resort as part of a wider corporate restructuring. In HoF\u2019s case, the banks and bondholders are not being asked to take an upfront haircut. Why not? If they were, perhaps more stores and more jobs could be saved. It may be tempting to dismiss the landlords\u2019 arguments as the self-interested bleats of anonymous financial institutions. Remember, though, that the landlord interest is dominated by a lot of pension fund money. The rush of CVAs from overborrowed retailers is a real problem. Can Ofwat plug Thames Water\u2019s leaks? Is regulator Ofwat, with its new chief executive, Rachel Fletcher, at the standpipe, finally getting tough with water companies for missing leakage targets? Well, up to a point. Thames Water is coughing up \u00a3120m in penalties and payments, which is the biggest headline package of remedies Ofwat has ever unveiled, even if the rebate only works out at \u00a315 per customer over two years. A record whack seems entirely in order. Thames did not just miss its leakage targets, it was not even close to meeting them. Reading between the lines of Thames\u2019s mea culpa, the company outsourced an essential job in a hurry and did not police its contractors thoroughly. Yet Ofwat can do nothing about the fact that Thames\u2019s former chief executive Martin Baggs, the man in charge when the rotten outsourcing system was adopted, departed in 2016 with a \u00a31.4m payoff. One line in Thames\u2019s statement about how it will do better in future is hilarious: \u201cIn addition, senior managers will only be rewarded for reducing leakage when targets are hit.\u201d So, you were previously rewarding failure to hit targets? That may have been the real problem. Amazon may experiment with football tactics Here it comes, Amazon\u2019s big splash into the world of Premier League football rights. Actually, it\u2019s more of a dipping of a toe into the water. Jeff Bezos\u2019s creation will screen 20 matches a season for three years, and there is a novelty element to the package it has secured \u2013 the right to stream all 10 games over one bank holiday weekend and over one midweek set of fixtures. Sky and BT Sport will not tremble in fear if that remains the extent of Amazon\u2019s ambition when the full set of rights come up for grabs next time. It still remains hard to see how, as things stand, Amazon could drive sufficient new subscribers to its Prime service to justify paying up to \u00a39m per game, which is the effective price in some of the top TV packages. Yet Amazon loves to experiment \u2013 and rarely does so unless it has a long-term strategy in mind. It will now get to play with the technology for three years and see what works. It may also be hoping that its mere presence will intimidate rivals in the next auction. In three years\u2019 time, would BT\u2019s investors really sanction yet more football if Amazon is on the prowl?",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The board of Marks &amp; Spencer has blocked annual bonuses for its top executives after the chain\u2019s plunge in annual profits meant shop-floor staff would not qualify for payouts. Vindi Banga, the senior non-executive director who chairs the M&amp;S remuneration committee, said the decision had been taken in the interests of fairness. \u201cThis decision was not taken lightly,\u201d said Banga. \u201cPre-tax profit was below the threshold required to pay bonuses to colleagues elsewhere in the business, and in the interests of fairness it would not be appropriate to pay a bonus to directors.\u201d The decision was intended to head off criticism of the retailer\u2019s board members as it embarked on its latest turnaround programme, which will close 100 shops over the next four years. The shake-up is also likely to trigger thousands of job losses. However, the M&amp;S chief executive, Steve Rowe, will still be handed shares worth \u00a32m next month under the company\u2019s long-term share bonus scheme. He was paid \u00a31.1m this year , according to the retailer\u2019s annual report. The package was made up of a basic salary of \u00a3810,000, an additional \u00a3203,000 in cash towards a pension and a \u00a376,000 share-award from a previous incentive. In 2017 he got a \u00a3600,000 cash bonus and was paid a total of \u00a31.6m. Rowe\u2019s cash bonus is decided according to a formula: 70% is pegged to the company\u2019s financial performance and the remainder tied to hitting other targets. It was in the latter category that the remuneration committee decided to axe payouts. \u201cThe committee decided to exercise its discretion that no payment would be made to any director, irrespective of any achievements against each director\u2019s individual objectives,\u201d said Banga. This year\u2019s round of shareholder meetings has been rocked by rows over excessive executive pay at various companies, including the housebuilder Persimmon, Ladbrokes\u2019 owner, GVC and the turnaround specialist Melrose. At Persimmon, shareholders revolted against the \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d \u00a375m bonus handed to the chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, while at Melrose shareholders pushed back against the decision to pay a \u00a342m bonus to each of four directors. Last month M&amp;S reported a 62% drop in pre-tax profits to \u00a366.8m after it racked up more than \u00a3500m restructuring costs. At that update the M&amp;S chairman, Archie Norman, promised that the years of disappointment endured by M&amp;S shoppers and investors were coming to an end, with the management team setting out a clear plan to revive the business. \u201cWe are looking for people to recognise that we are building a very strong management team who are going to give this a bloody good shot,\u201d said Norman, who is best known for reviving the fortunes of Asda and ITV. \u201cI\u2019m convinced this is a turning point in our history.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The United States and China have reached a deal that allows the Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE to stay in business in exchange for paying an additional $1bn in fines and agreeing to let US regulators monitor its operations. The fine comes after Donald Trump stepped in to save the company after US regulators barred it from doing business in the US, an effective death blow for the company. In addition to the fine, a compliance team chosen by the US will be embedded at ZTE and the Chinese company must change its board and executive team. \u201cZTE is essentially on probation,\u201d said Amanda DeBusk, chair of the international trade and government regulation practice at Dechert LLP and a former commerce official. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented to have US agents as monitors \u2026 It\u2019s certainly a good precedent for this situation. ZTE is a repeat offender.\u201d The news did little to appease critics. Senator Mark Warner, vice-chairman of the Senate select committee on intelligence, said: \u201cIt is the unanimous conclusion of our nation\u2019s intelligence community that ZTE poses a significant threat to our national security. These concerns aren\u2019t new; back in 2012, the House permanent select committee on intelligence released a report on the serious counterintelligence concerns associated with ZTE equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s not only that ZTE was busted for evading sanctions on Iran and North Korea, and then lied about it; it\u2019s that ZTE is a state-controlled telecommunications company that poses significant espionage risks, which this agreement appears to do little to address.\u201d In April, the commerce department barred ZTE from importing American components for seven years, having concluded that it deceived US regulators after it settled charges last year of sanctions violations. Instead of disciplining all employees involved, the department said, ZTE had paid some of them full bonuses and then lied about it. The decision amounted to a death sentence to ZTE, which relies on US parts and which announced that it was halting operations. The ban also hurt American companies that supply ZTE. Trump barged into the ZTE case last month by tweeting that he was working with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to put ZTE \u201cback in business, fast\u201d and save tens of thousands of Chinese jobs. He later tweeted that the ZTE talks were \u201cpart of a larger trade deal\u201d being negotiated with China. Trump has drawn criticism from members of Congress for going easy on the Chinese company. The Democratic senator Chuck Schumer of New York immediately responded to Thursday\u2019s announcement: \u201cDespite his tough talk, this deal with ZTE proves the president just shoots blanks.\u201d Still, the resolution of the ZTE case may clear the way for the US to make progress in its trade talks with China. The two countries have threatened to impose tariffs on up to $200bn worth of each other\u2019s products in a dispute over China\u2019s tactics to supplant US technological supremacy, including demands that US companies hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market. Thursday\u2019s agreement was \u201ca prerequisite for making broader progress\u201d, DeBusk said. \u201cThe ZTE case was a thorn in the side for China \u2026 For the US to shut down one of China\u2019s largest companies is a very dramatic type of move. It certainly got their attention.\u201d",

The two countries have threatened to impose tariffs on up to $200bn worth of each other\u2019s products in a dispute over China\u2019s tactics to supplant US technological supremacy, including demands that US companies hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market.</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s agreement was \u201ca prerequisite for making broader progress\u201d, DeBusk said. \u201cThe ZTE case was a thorn in the side for China \u2026 For the US to shut down one of China\u2019s largest companies is a very dramatic type of move. It certainly got their attention.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "I think that\u2019s all for today. Here\u2019s our news stories on the House of Fraser store closure plan: After suffering technical problems that delayed that start of trading by an hour, Britain\u2019s stock exchange has ended the day calmly. The FTSE 100 just closed eight points lower at 7,704 points. Retailers had a mixed day; Marks &amp; Spencer lost 1.1% while Next dipped by 0.4%. Oil companies had a better day, though, with BP the top riser (up 2.2%). Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, explains why energy stocks were in demand: Oil rallied hard across the session, jumping 1.5% and recouping losses from the previous session. Buyers came flooding back into the oil market as concerns over supply issues in Venezuela overshadow fears that OPEC could be on the verge of easing oil production cuts. With 2 weeks remaining until the OPEC meeting in Vienna, we are expecting an increase in volatility as investors weigh up the probability of an increase in production against the increasing supply problems in Venezuela and Iran. Oil stocks such as BP and Shell traced the price of oil higher. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to Dave Ramsden\u2019s views on the UK economy: The pound has crept a little higher, up 0.15% at $1.343, but frankly sterling has been volatile all day (as Theresa May and David Davis have tried to hammer out an agreement on Britain\u2019s Brexit backstop plan). Newsflash: A senior Bank of England policymaker has declared that the UK economy is emerging from its recent soft patch. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden is telling an audience in London that recent data supports the bank\u2019s view that the slowdown earlier this year was temporary. The Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) resisted raising interest rates in May, and Ramsden\u2019s comments suggest a rate rise could come in August. Ramsden says: \u201cIt is still early days. We are still only two thirds of the way through the second quarter, less far through the second quarter data cycle, and only a month has passed since our last MPC meeting. \u201cEven so, the data we have had so far suggests our interpretation of the slowdown in the first quarter as temporary looks to be being borne out. Consumer confidence and consumer credit both picked up in the latest data, as did retail sales and several business surveys. That included the latest services PMI (purchasing managers\u2019 index) output balance, representing 80% of the economy. So far at least our May judgement looks on track. \u201cLooking ahead, my central expectation for the economy is in line with the MPC\u2019s best collective judgement as expressed in our inflation report forecasts. Global growth still looks solid, albeit a bit less rosy than it did before. The labour market is still robust. I expect GDP growth to resume at a steady but unspectacular pace and demand to continue to rotate away from consumption and towards trade and investment.\u201d Ramsden is seen as a dovish member of the MPC, having opposed last November\u2019s rate hike. Another reason why landlords are unhappy about House of Fraser\u2019s move: House of Fraser\u2019s attempt to use a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to close 31 stores and cut the rent on some others will annoy some landlords. Matthew Weaver, partner at Radcliffe Chambers, explains why property owners are losing patience with this legal manoeuvre: Landlords are becoming restless in the face of numerous CVAs proposed and entered into by retailers in which they are faced with significant decreases in the rent being charged and, in some instances, closure of stores which still have significant lease periods left on them \u2013 thereby reducing or removing income for the landlords. Typically, landlords of profitable stores are treated reasonably well in CVA proposals but those of loss-making stores are offered very little. This flexibility to treat different landlords differently (i.e. repaying the majority of some landlord debts under a CVA but very little of other landlord debts) has angered landlords generally as has the fact that CVA proposals often treat other creditors (suppliers for example) much better and do not impact on the rights of secured creditors (such as banks or other funders). In addition, other businesses (most notably Next) have indicated that they are now sick and tired of competitor businesses using CVAs to reduce overheads, giving them an obvious competitive advantage. Next has stated that it will begin to negotiate a \u201cCVA clause\u201d into its new leases whereby its rent will be reduced in keeping with any reduction under a CVA of a business trading nearby to their stores. This will only increase the anger of landlords. There is a view that retailers are using CVAs to gain a commercial advantage and there is a growing air of cynicism about them. This is not helped by the subsequent administration or liquidation of a number of high-profile retailers that have entered into CVAs which have failed, asking the question of whether the CVA was ever an appropriate step to attempt in the first place. Plymouth City Council are disappointed that their local store faces the axe: One male shopper on Oxford Street tells us: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a shock.\u201d He hoped that the newly refurbished House of Fraser store near Victoria station in London would stay open. \u201cI don\u2019t really do online shopping. I like the personal touch.\u201d Otherwise he said he would probably switch to Debenhams or John Lewis. Christopher Scott, who hates shopping and had come to House of Fraser\u2019s Oxford Street shop for his \u201cone big shopping trip of the year\u201d was indifferent to the store closure, although he added: \u201cI got a winter coat from House of Fraser [in the past]. It\u2019s quite good.\u201d But he was also wary of online shopping, saying clothes often don\u2019t fit if you don\u2019t try them on. Shoppers at House of Fraser\u2019s Oxford Street branch say they were shocked and saddened to hear of the flagship store\u2019s closure. Pamela Emmanuel, who has a House of Fraser loyalty card and has been shopping there for more than 20 years, told us: \u201cI\u2019m shocked that they are closing this one because it is Oxford Street. There are still so many people that don\u2019t do online shopping. I like to come and try things on.\u201d She said she had an inkling when the department store stopped selling the Petite range of clothes that she liked, and could not get an appointment at the nail bar which she thought was shutting. Lala Ahmadova, who has been shopping at House of Fraser since she moved to London from Azerbaijan 10 years ago, said: \u201cIt\u2019s sad people are going to lose their jobs. It\u2019s something like BHS \u2013 it\u2019s another shop that has been here for a long time.\u201d She said the retailer sells some brands that you cannot buy elsewhere on the high street, such as Hallhuber womenswear and Timberland Kids. House of Fraser employs 990 people directly and through its concessions at the two London stores that are due to be shut, in Oxford Street and the City. A member of staff working in beauty knew about the store closure but said he had not been told about his future. Jeanne Bateman from Norwich said: \u201cI\u2019m a big high street shopper. I\u2019m very sad to see so many big high street names closing down. I feel sorry for us the shopper, and very sorry for the people who work here.\u201d Her daughter Catherine Wilamowska agreed, although she added that because she lives in a small village she does all her shopping online. Another regular House of Fraser shopper, Sille Jeeawon, said: \u201cI will be very sad. I like what they sell.\u201d She said she would go to Debenhams once the Oxford Street shop shuts its doors. Shoppers in Birkenhead, Merseyside, are unhappy that their local House of Fraser is earmarked for closure. Doreen Gibson, 81, from Greasby, Wirral, told the Press Association that she and her friends would miss the department store badly \u2013 and blamed young shoppers for buying on the Internet... \u201cWe\u2019ve been coming here every two weeks for 25 years. We meet our friends and have a coffee in the restaurant and a bit of shopping. \u201cIt is devastating. They are all shopping online now, all the younger ones, that\u2019s what\u2019s ruining it all. Some people still like to go and see what they are going to buy. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s really, really terrible news.\u201d After crunching the numbers, we can report that at least 35,00 jobs are at risk - or already cut - across Britain\u2019s retailers and restaurant chains since the start of this year: Despite the Father\u2019s Day offers that are heavily advertised in the street-level window displays, the Frasers store in Edinburgh was quiet on Thursday morning, as the unexpectedly warm weather encouraged shoppers outdoors, my colleague Libby Brooks reports. Staff at the store, one of two owned by the retailer on Princes Street, the city\u2019s main thoroughfare, had been told not to speak to the media. Each till point has issued with contact details for the press office at headquarters, but many staff privately expressed shock at the news that the store would be closed in early 2019, affected 127 jobs, with some close to tears. Others expressed anger that, although the proposed closure of 31 stores was already public knowledge, they had heard about the closure of their own store from the morning news bulletins rather than from management. One described an \u201catmosphere\u201d in the days leading up to the announcement, but remained surprised at the decision. Window-shopping with his partner on a day trip from Fife, David Bell said that if upmarket retailers like Frasers and its sister store Jenners along the street were failing to make a profit, then it was further evidence that shoppers were moving online. \u201cThe high streets are suffering everywhere, even Kirkcaldy where we\u2019re from has so many closures. In a place like Frasers they are charging 50% more than you\u2019d pay online and they still can\u2019t make a profit. Shopping online is not just convenient, it\u2019s so much cheaper.\u201d Looking up at the prime site on the corner of Princes Street, opposite the Waldorf Astoria, he asked: \u201cWhat will they do with the building now? It\u2019s been here forever but I can\u2019t think who would want to take it over.\u201d In the Pride of Scots gift shop next door to Frasers, Abdul Manan blamed the location of the store for poor footfall. \u201cPeople don\u2019t come to this end of the street. It\u2019s really the wrong location. They go further up Princes Street, where the Scott Monument is. Jenners is in a really good spot.\u201d Here are a few of the House of Fraser stores facing the axe, if the company\u2019s creditors approve its restructuring plan. Another UK company, the AA, is facing its shareholders at its annual general meeting. Investors are angry about the pay packages handed to bosses, and demanding (in vain) answers about the dismissal of the former chairman. Some more mundane issues are also on the agenda, as my colleague Rob Davies reports from the AGM: At the AA annual meeting, chairman John Leach has said the company will not be answering any questions about former chairman Bob Mackenzie, who is suing the company for \u00a3225m after he was sacked over an assault on a colleague at a country hotel. Despite finance chief Martin Clarke having voluntarily given up a bonus earlier this year, 24% of voting shareholders have rejected the company\u2019s pay policy, although not all votes are in yet. Chairman John Leach says some shareholders are concerned about the uncertainty around performance conditions attached to company bonus plans. In the absence of any questions on Bob Mackenzie, one shareholder has raised two equally scintillating matters. The first is a request that the motor industry sue the government over the impact of potholes. The second is that there be gluten-free biscuits at future AGMs. One of House of Fraser\u2019s (many) problems is a failure to engage with millennials. Amelia Brophy, head of data products at YouGov, explains how the chain has lagged behind nimbler retail rivals, and failed to impress younger shoppers: \u201cYouGov BrandIndex data underlines how House of Fraser\u2019s brand perception has declined over the past year. Its Impression score (whether someone has a favourable impression of the brand) among the general public has declined from +23 last May to +19 now. Its score among younger consumers, those in the 18-34 age bracket, is even lower, at +17. This is been mirrored by shifts in the brand\u2019s Quality score, which, among the general public has fallen from +32 to +29. However, the key is the brand\u2019s Value score, particularly among younger customers. Overall, it has a rating of just +1, way behind online rivals that have outflanked it. Among 18-24s its score is -4, well below other stores such as H&amp;M (+31), Asos (+27) and Boohoo (+14).\u201d Patrick O\u2019Brien, UK research director at GlobalData Retail, reckons Marks &amp; Spencer could benefit from House of Fraser\u2019s retrenchment: M&amp;S is also cutting back on stores, with more than 100 expected to close over the next few years. Typo alert: That last headline should have said \u2018Poundworld\u2019, of course, not \u2018Poundland\u2019. Now fixed, sorry for any confusion.... It\u2019s turning into another black day for UK retail, with reports that budget chain Poundworld is on the brink of administration. Poundworld could file for administration today, putting more than 5,000 jobs at risk across the UK. The company, which made a loss of \u00a317m last year, has been trying to find a buyer for some time, but without success. It has 355 stores, and faces a quarterly rent bill in less than three weeks. Press Association has more details: Sources told PA that the notice will give Poundworld time to structure a deal, which could be undertaken through a pre-pack administration, with private equity firm R Capital, former owner of Little Chef. The administration will be handled by Poundworld\u2019s advisers Deloitte. Poundworld, which is owned by TPG Capital, had previously rejected offers to sell through a pre-pack but all options are now being considered. Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman also fears that Poundworld will join the swelling ranks of UK retailers forced into administration. The Labour Party have accused the government of neglecting Britain\u2019s struggling retail sector, while it struggled to get to grips with Brexit. Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Shadow Business Secretary, points out that more than tens of thousands jobs are being lost this year: \u201cIn the first three months of this year 21,000 jobs were lost in the retail sector. Today another 6000 jobs are at risk as House of Fraser confirms store closures across the UK. \u201cWhile the Cabinet is in chaos over Brexit their lack of focus on our high streets is leading to mass job losses, failing one of the biggest employers and industrial sectors in the UK, which is why Labour has called on the Business Secretary to publish a retail sector strategy to safeguard jobs. \u201cThe next Labour government will support retail by placing it at the heart of our industrial strategy. It\u2019s time for the Tories to step up to the challenge of rescuing our high streets.\u201d The rising use of CVAs by cash-strapped retailers is hurting Britain\u2019s landlords, warns Daniel Stern, commercial property litigator at Manchester-based law firm Slater Heelis. Stern says there is a \u2018rescue culture\u2019 at the heart of insolvency regimes, allowing retailers to go into administration, shed unprofitable operations, and then emerge stronger. \u201cOnly 75 per cent of a company\u2019s creditors need to approve a CVA which is then legally binding on all unsecured creditors, including landlords, regardless of whether the landlord agreed the proposal. \u201cThis effectively means property owners must accept lower rents to help a tenant avoid financial collapse. As landlords are often pension and investment funds this is having a knock-on effect on the ordinary man in the street. The Huffington Post have helpfully listed the 28 House of Fraser stores that are staying open if the CVA is agreed. They are: Gateshead Metro Centre, Huddersfield, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield Meadowhall, Sutton Coldfield, Bluewater, Croydon, London City, London Victoria, London Westfield, Richmond, West Thurrock Lakeside, Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham, Cirencester, Exeter, Guildford, Maidstone, Norwich, Reading The Oracle, Rushden Lakes, Edinburgh (Jenners), Glasgow, Loch Lomond Shores (Jenners), and Belfast. Victor Garcia Capdevila of credit rating agency Moody\u2019s believes the store closure plan should give House of Fraser some breathing room to tackle its problems. Capdevila says: \u201cStore closures will allow House of Fraser to reduce its rent bill and exit long-dated lease agreements in unprofitable locations. This should facilitate and accelerate the transformation of the company into a more effective multi-channel retailer while alleviating liquidity challenges that have necessitated cash injections from its owner over the past few months.\u201d Moody\u2019s currently has a Caa1 rating on House of Fraser\u2019s debt. That\u2019s a \u2018junk\u2019 rating, implying a substantial risk that the company might not repay its borrowings [Caa1 is the 17th highest rating, only four above default]. House of Fraser says it has put another \u00a31m into its pension fund to secure the backing of its pension trustees for its CVA restructuring plan. In other news, Britain\u2019s housing market is still in sluggish mode, according to the latest survey. House prices rose 1.5% in May from the month before, following a sharp drop of 3.1% in April, says Halifax, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group. The average price of a home is now \u00a3224,439. This means prices grew just 0.2% in the three months to May from the previous quarter, while the annual rate slowed to 1.9% from 2.2%. Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax, said: \u201cBoth of these measures have fallen since reaching a recent peak, in the final months of last year. These latest price changes reflect a relatively subdued UK housing market. After a sharp rise in January, mortgage approvals have softened in the past three months. Whilst both newly agreed sales and new buyer enquiries are showing signs of stabilisation having fallen in recent months.\u201d The Cardiff branch of House of Fraser, which is earmarked for closure in today\u2019s plan, is opening late today (presumably because staff are being briefed about the situation?). This store is one of the biggest department stores in Wales. It dates back to the 1850s, when James Howell opened a department store there. Howells was acquired by the House of Fraser group in the 1970s. The store closures announcement is awful news for thousands of House of Fraser staff. Some will have discovered their job is being eliminated as they headed to work this morning. Four stores in the West Midlands are closing, for example, as Simon Penfold of the Birmingham Express and Star explains: It will mean more than 1,100 people losing their jobs across the West Midlands. The Beatties store in Wolverhampton employs 279, 150 work at Telford, 83 at Shrewsbury and 688 at the House of Fraser store in Birmingham. Some staff learned of the news through Twitter before they even got to work today. Here\u2019s our retail correspondent Sarah Butler on today\u2019s news: House of Fraser is to close 31 stores, more than half of its UK chain, putting a further 6,000 retail jobs at risk and dealing another hammer blow to British high streets. The struggling department store group\u2019s Oxford Street flagship in London and outlets in cities including Birmingham, Cardiff and Edinburgh are among those facing closure. The drastic cuts form part of a rescue plan that will also lead to the company moving out of its head offices in London and Glasgow. The 31 outlets would close by early next year under a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency that enables a business to rearrange deals with landlords. Creditors are set to vote on the deal, which includes reducing rents by 25% at 10 other stores, on 22 June. The House of Fraser chairman, Frank Slevin, said: \u201cThe retail industry is undergoing fundamental change and House of Fraser urgently needs to adapt to this fast-changing landscape in order to give it a future and allow it to thrive. Our legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base, which, without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business. \u201cSo while closing stores is a very difficult decision, especially given the length of relationship House of Fraser has with all its locations, there should be no doubt that it is absolutely necessary if we are to continue to trade and be competitive.\u201d More here: House of Fraser\u2019s creditors will vote on today\u2019s proposal on 22 June. As well as shutting 31 department stores, the company also wants to shave 25% off the rent of another 16 stores. If landlords agree, then these 16 stores (plus another 10) will remain open and keep trading, the company says. Back to House of Fraser.... and ITV News\u2019 Joel Hills reports that some landlords will oppose the plan to shut 31 stores. Back in the City, London\u2019s stock market failed to open at 8am. The London Stock Exchange are blaming \u2018technical\u2019 issues, and have just managed to get trading running. It\u2019s a highly unusual development - the last such outage occurred in 2011 (updated). Hopefully we\u2019ll find out what went wrong soon.... Alex Williamson, chief executive of House of Fraser, has promised to support the 6,000 staff who could lose their jobs: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is one of the most important in this company\u2019s 169-year history. \u201cWe, as a management team, have a responsibility to take necessary steps to ensure House of Fraser\u2019s survival, which is why we are making these proposals. I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to all my colleagues at House of Fraser for working tirelessly throughout this difficult period. We are fully committed to supporting those personally affected by the proposals. Assuming today\u2019s plan is approved, the 31 stores earmarked for closure up and down the country will shut in early 2019. John Pal, retail expert at Alliance Manchester Business School, says retailers such as House of Fraser are facing a \u2018perfect storm\u2019. Rising business rates, competition from internet rivals, and over-capacity on the high street are making some stores unviable. Pal says: \u201cNews that House of Fraser is to close stores comes as no surprise as many retailers grapple with stagnating sales and increasing running costs. Once the training budget has been cut, over-time slashed and overall headcount reduced, in both head offices and in stores, it\u2019s time to focus on the big costs of which stores are a main one. Richard Lim, chief executive, Retail Economics says today\u2019s store closures reflect the move away from high street stores and onto internet shopping: \u201cNews that House of Fraser is to shut its Oxford Street store and 30 others is a huge statement of intent. The closure of such an iconic flagship store signals the massive restructuring task at hand. \u201cDepartment stores are incredibly expensive to operate and the last few years have seen costs spiraling upwards from business rates, rents and National Living Wage. These traditional retail business models that hold huge fixed costs are simply becoming unsustainable for some retailers. \u201cThe announcement to close such a significant number of stores highlights the unyielding shift towards online shopping and the overcapacity concerns faced by a significant proportion of the market. The retailer will need to push forward right-sizing initiatives and utilise any excess space to sweat assets more effectively in a move become fit-for-purpose in today\u2019s digital age. Economics journalist Dharshini David agrees that UK retailers are suffering from \u2018desperate\u2019 times: Today\u2019s grim announcement follows weeks of talks between House of Fraser\u2019s owners - China\u2019s C. Banner - and its lenders and landlords. House of Fraser needs 70 per cent of its creditors \u2013 including landlords \u2013 to back the plan filed this morning. If they don\u2019t, then the entire company would probably collapse into administration. That would put 17,000 jobs at risk across its 59 stores. Frank Slevin, chairman of House of Fraser, say the company needs to shut more than half its stores, or face collapsing altogether. \u201cThe retail industry is undergoing fundamental change and House of Fraser urgently needs to adapt to this fast-changing landscape in order to give it a future and allow it to thrive. \u201cOur legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base, which without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business. \u201cSo whilst closing stores is a very difficult decision, especially given the length of relationship House of Fraser has with all its locations, there should be no doubt that it is absolutely necessary if we are to continue to trade and be competitive.\u201d House of Fraser is shutting these 31 stores under a company voluntary arrangement. It\u2019s effectively a deal between a struggling firm and its creditors under which underperforming stores are shed. Under the CVA, House of Fraser is looking to cut the rent on these 31 stores to just 30% for the next seven months - and then shut them down. Accountancy firm KPMG is managing the process. Will Wright, restructuring partner at KPMG, says a CVA is needed to keep House of Fraser operating in today\u2019s tough retail environment. \u201cThe CVAs proposed by House of Fraser give the business a vital lifeline to avoid administration by renegotiating the lease terms of its UK-wide property portfolio, as part of a wider restructuring. The business has been impacted by the mounting pressures facing the UK high street, with the declining profitability of certain stores exacerbated by costly legacy leases which were originally negotiated many years ago. With trading conditions unlikely to materially improve in the short term, the future of House of Fraser is at significant risk unless steps to restructure the business both financially and operationally are taken.\u201d NEWSFLASH: Retail chain House of Fraser has announced plans to shut more than half of its UK and Ireland stores, in a move that will cost up to 6,000 jobs. House of Fraser is planning to close 31 of its 59 stores across the UK and Ireland, under a restructuring plan filed at the Court of Session in Edinburgh this morning. The list of stores includes House of Fraser\u2019s flagship site on London\u2019s Oxford Street, as well as at towns and cities across the country. Here\u2019s the list of stores that will close over the next few months: Altrincham, Aylesbury, Birkenhead, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Camberley, Cardiff, Carlisle, Chichester, Cirencester, Cwmbran, Darlington, Doncaster, Edinburgh Frasers, Epsom, Grimsby, High Wycombe, Hull, Leamington Spa, Lincoln, London Oxford Street, London King William Street, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes, Plymouth, Shrewsbury, Skipton, Swindon, Telford, Wolverhampton, Worcester. More to follow.... Back in the UK, Thames Water is handing \u00a365m to customers as part of a \u00a3120m package of penalties for failing to tackle leaks: Germany\u2019s economy ministry is trying to sound upbeat - pointing out that the country\u2019s factories still have a decent backlog of orders to plough through: \u201cTo what extent uncertainties play a role, especially from the external environment, is difficult to assess. However, the order backlog in the manufacturing sector is still very high.\u201d Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s chief economist for Germany, is disappointed by the 2.5% decline in German factory orders last month. He agrees that it suggests Germany\u2019s economy has weakened this year. Normally, an increase in new orders after three consecutive drops looks as safe a bet as predicting tomorrow\u2019s sunrise. However, it seems that today the sun did not rise for German industry. It will get harder and harder to explain these monthly drops with one-offs like the weather or the timing of holidays. In fact, evidence is piling up that the soft patch at the start of the year has been more serious than previously thought. For the time being, we remain cautiously positive. In absolute terms, order books are still richly filled, assured production is high and inventories have been reduced recently. All boding well for industrial activity in the coming months. However, today\u2019s disappointing new orders reading sends a clear warning that nothing should be taken for granted. Good morning , and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. German factory have suffered their fourth drop in monthly orders in a row, raising fresh fears over the strength of Europe\u2019s largest economy. Industrial orders slumped by 2.5% in April, new figures from the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis) show. On an annual basis, order numbers in April were 0.1% lower than in April 2017. March\u2019s data has been revised down too, to show a 1.1% drop in demand. The decline was driven by a 4.8% drop in domestic orders, while new orders from Germany\u2019s eurozone neighbours tumbled by almost 10%, Destatis reports. Capital goods orders (for machinery etc) fell by 5.6% month-on-month in April, while consumer goods orders fell by 2.2%. Intermediate goods orders rose by 2.5%, though. The data is much worse than expected - economists had forecast a 0.8% rise in orders for goods with \u201cMade In Germany\u201d stamped proudly on them. This decline suggests that the German economy has made a faltering start to 2018, perhaps dragged back by fears of a trade war triggered by Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Experts are warning that Germany\u2019s factories have made a \u2018horrible\u2019 start to the second quarter of 2018 - a worrying sign for its economy, and the wider global economy too. More details and reaction to follow... Also coming up today The demise of UK outsourcing and construction group Carillion is going to cost taxpayers more than \u00a3150m, according to an official report. The lawyers and accountants clearing up the mess will bank around \u00a370m, though! The Halifax bank will release its latest survey of the UK housing market this morning. Last month it reported a 3.1% monthly decline; today\u2019s figures could show a recovery. We also get updated eurozone growth figures for the first quarter. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is expected to open higher, following a strong day on New York last night. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: Risk on in Wall Street, transferred to a solid session in Asia and is seen lifting European markets into the opening bell. Despite talks of retaliation measures from US allies on trade tariffs, which in the words of the World Bank, risks sending the global economy back to a state similar to that 10 years ago, global equity markets continue bounding higher.

Consumer confidence and consumer credit both picked up in the latest data, as did retail sales and several business surveys.

So far at least our May judgement looks on track.</p> <p>\u201cLooking ahead, my central expectation for the economy is in line with the MPC\u2019s best collective judgement as expressed in our inflation report forecasts. Global growth still looks solid, albeit a bit less rosy than it did before. The labour market is still robust.

Typically, landlords of profitable stores are treated reasonably well in CVA proposals but those of loss-making stores are offered very little. This flexibility to treat different landlords differently (i.e. repaying the majority of some landlord debts under a CVA but very little of other landlord debts) has angered landlords generally as has the fact that CVA proposals often treat other creditors (suppliers for example) much better and do not impact on the rights of secured creditors (such as banks or other funders).</p> <p>In addition, other businesses (most notably Next) have indicated that they are now sick and tired of competitor businesses using CVAs to reduce overheads, giving them an obvious competitive advantage. Next has stated that it will begin to negotiate a \u201cCVA clause\u201d into its new leases whereby its rent will be reduced in keeping with any reduction under a CVA of a business trading nearby to their stores. This will only increase the anger of landlords.</p> <p>There is a view that retailers are using CVAs to gain a commercial advantage and there is a growing air of cynicism about them. This is not helped by the subsequent administration or liquidation of a number of high-profile retailers that have entered into CVAs which have failed, asking the question of whether the CVA was ever an appropriate step to attempt in the first place.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b19401fe4b0033069065b97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-07T14:25:03.405Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Plymouth City Council are disappointed that their local store faces the axe:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/plymouthcc/status/1004728003639816192\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Plymouth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Plymouth</a>&#39;s Council leader Tudor Evans speaks out about House of Fraser announcement: &quot;Clearly a blow for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Plymouth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Plymouth</a> to have this store on the list...but we need to find out more about the proposal.&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/yYXAoMvy7A\">https://t.co/yYXAoMvy7A</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/QkJ7kEMZTD\">pic.twitter.com/QkJ7kEMZTD</a></p>&mdash; PCC (@plymouthcc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/plymouthcc/status/1004728003639816192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b193811e4b0033069065b30\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/juliakollewe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-07T13:51:08.376Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One male shopper on Oxford Street tells us:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a shock.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>He hoped that the newly refurbished House of Fraser store near Victoria station in London would stay open. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really do online shopping.

      "bodyText": "The chances of an August rise in interest rates have increased after one of the most cautious policy setters at the Bank of England signalled support for higher borrowing costs. Sir Dave Ramsden, one of Threadneedle Street\u2019s deputy governors, said the economy seemed to be coming out of its early 2018 soft patch at a time when wage pressures were mounting. Ramsden, one of only two members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee to vote against last November\u2019s quarter-point increase in official interest rates to 0.5% said that in the absence of further tightening of policy, inflation would breach the government\u2019s 2% target. In a speech in London, Ramsden said the low level of earnings growth had been key when he adopted a wait-and-see approach to higher interest rates in November. However, he added that wage growth had been rising steadily for the past six months. \u201cThe period of unusually subdued growth in wages appears to be coming to an end.\u201d The Bank decided against raising rates in May, despite strong hints of a move, after a run of weak economic data in the weeks ahead of the MPC\u2019s meeting. Ramsden said the evidence since the meeting appeared to confirm the committee\u2019s view that the slowdown would prove temporary. \u201cIt is still early days. We are still only two-thirds of the way through the second quarter, less far through the second quarter data cycle, and only a month has passed since our last MPC meeting. \u201cEven so, the data we have had so far suggests our interpretation of the slowdown in the first quarter as temporary looks to be being borne out. Consumer confidence and consumer credit both picked up in the latest data, as did retail sales and several business surveys. That included the latest services PMI [purchasing managers\u2019 index] output balance, representing 80% of the economy. So far at least our May judgment looks on track. \u201cLooking ahead, my central expectation for the economy is in line with the MPC\u2019s best collective judgment as expressed in our inflation report forecasts. Global growth still looks solid, albeit a bit less rosy than it did before. The labour market is still robust. I expect GDP growth to resume at a steady but unspectacular pace and demand to continue to rotate away from consumption and towards trade and investment.\u201d Ramsden said that even this subdued pace of growth would be enough to exceed the Bank\u2019s new lower speed limit, which has been lowered as a result of the economy\u2019s feeble productivity performance in the decade since the financial crisis. Unemployment was on course to fall to 4% and a small margin of excess demand would open up. Ramsden said that without the three quarter point rate rises expected by the financial markets over the next three years inflation would stay persistently around 2.4% and so be \u201cmaterially\u201d above its target. \u201cThis does not seem a desirable outcome. Inflation persistently above target and a sustained period of excess demand would represent a failure to meet our remit.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "How big is the \u201cgig economy\u201d? On Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics gave the first official reading of how many Americans rely on temporary work, freelancing, and on-demand apps to make ends meet. And the answer is: a lot. The report found that 16.5 million people are working in \u201ccontingent\u201d or \u201calternative work arrangements\u201d. Nearly 6 million people, 3.8% of workers, held contingent jobs in the US in May. Another 10.6 million were working as independent contractors, on-call workers, temporary help agency workers and for contract firms. The numbers, which include jobs at gig economy leaders such as Uber, Lyft and Airbnb, dwarf other more high-profile industries. The coal industry, for example, employs about 80,000 Americans, and steel employs about 150,000. The figures give academics and activists their first real hard data as courts, workers and employees struggle with the consequences of a changing work environment. To date, private estimates of the size of the gig economy have varied wildly, with economists calculating that non-traditional work arrangements account for anywhere between 0.1% of full-time employment and 34%. Although the BLS study will become the base for much future research, the snapshot does not give a complete picture. According to the BLS, the latest figures measure \u201cindependent contractors, on-call workers, temporary help agency workers, and workers provided by contract firms\u201d. The questionnaire is self-reported and the categories do not have clear demarcations of where one role begins and the other ends. In Manhattan on Wednesday, Adrian (who declined to provide his last name), a New York Uber driver, said he couldn\u2019t figure out whether he was working under a \u201ccontingent or alternate arrangement\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m kinda like a small business owner, but Uber takes a 30% cut,\u201d he said. It is 13 years since the last report into this sector, and BLS economists said there were no plans for any follow-up release. In 2015, economists Lawrence Katz and Alan Krueger estimated the size of the online platform and gig economy workforce to be less than half a percent of total US employment. But as they pointed out, at the time Uber was doubling its US workforce every six months and the increase in gig economy jobs was likely to be substantial. The BLS report does not delineate between online and offline intermediaries. According to Katz and Krueger, there are \u201chundreds of thousands more workers, like many taxi drivers, Avon direct-sales workers and others who currently work with an offline intermediary. Adrian, the New York Uber driver, said: \u201cI get paid cash for teaching guitar to kids.\u201d More detail is due in September when the BLS will report how many people are working for \u201celectronically mediated\u201d services. The report does not quantify how many workers do gig work occasionally. JP Morgan estimates that \u201c4% of the population has worked through an online platform at some point\u201d. The holes in the data are problematic at a time when so many gig workers are trapped in a regulatory and legal grey area. And under the current administration, this grey space has given way to diminished workers\u2019 rights. Under Barack Obama, the labor department\u2019s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) offered informal regulatory guidance on gig workers. And the WHD said it would pursue investigations into complaints about worker classification and subsequent pay disputes. But Donald Trump\u2019s labor secretary, Alex Acosta, removed that guidance. With the lack of clarity from government, the courts have been left to define and rule on the rights of gig workers. In a northern California district court case where Lyft drivers successfully sued Lyft, Judge Vince Chhabria ruled that without a clear test for worker classification, questions will persist, such as: \u201cShould Lyft drivers who work more than a certain number of hours be employees? And why does this matter?\u201d A McKinsey report found that independent contractors get paid 20-30% less than employees.",

      "bodyText": "Poundworld is preparing to appoint administrators as the struggling discount chain makes a last ditch attempt to avoid collapse. On Thursday the retailer, which has 5,000 staff, filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator. The filing temporarily shields Poundworld from its creditors, giving bosses 10 working days to come up with a restructuring plan for the 355 store chain. Poundworld\u2019s problems first surfaced in April when its owner, the American private equity firm TPG Capital, was said to be considering a plan to launch a CVA, an insolvency procedure that would enable it to reduce rents and close about 100 stores. Poundworld was acquired by TPG Capital for \u00a3150m in 2015 but it has struggled in the wake of the Brexit blow to sterling that pushed up the cost of imported goods. Last month, TPG used a CVA to close nearly 100 branches of its ailing restaurant chain Prezzo. In May it emerged that TPG had decided to cut it losses and was putting Poundworld, which started in 1974 as a market stall in Wakefield in West Yorkshire, up for sale. However with no deal done by Monday\u2019s deadline, the company is using the moratorium provided by the court filing to try and put together an eleventh hour deal ahead of its next rent payment date, which is 24 June. Poundworld\u2019s difficulties come as a string of retailers and restaurants seek to exit high street outlets in the face of rising costs and a squeeze on consumer spending. House of Fraser announced plans on Thursday to close 31 stores, putting a further 6,000 jobs at risk. Mothercare, New Look and Carpetright are all closing dozens of stores after creditors approved CVAs. The burger chain Byron and Jamie\u2019s Italian restaurants have also closed outlets using the process. There may be some hope for Poundworld staff as turnaround firm RCapital is said to be discussing a rescue deal with TPG. The return of Chris Edwards, the company\u2019s founder who sold out to the private equity firm, has also been mooted.",

    "webTitle": "Ikea commits to phase out single-use plastic products by 2020", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ikea is to phase out all single-use plastic products from its stores and restaurants by 2020 amid growing concern about the effects of plastic on the environment. Ikea said plastic straws, plates, cups, freezer bags, bin bags, and plastic-coated paper plates and cups would all be phased out and where possible replaced by alternatives. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have all the answers yet but we are working together with our suppliers to find solutions that are good for both people and the planet.\u201d The Swedish furniture chain is already committed to phasing out oil-based plastics and is aiming to ensure all its plastic products are made using recycled materials by August 2020. It has invested in a plastics recycling plant to help push the plan forward. The latest move comes amid growing concern over plastic pollution in the world\u2019s oceans, where it can harm and kill wildlife such as turtles and seabirds. The retailer, which has more than 363 stores worldwide, says it also wants to help its customers live more sustainably by offering products such as a tap nozzle that could save more than 90% of water used. It will also be offering solar panels in 29 markets, up from five at present, by 2025 and introducing more vegetarian foods into its cafes. \u201cThrough our size and reach we have the opportunity to inspire and enable more than 1 billion people to live better lives, within the limits of the planet\u201d, Torbj\u00f6rn L\u00f6\u00f6f, the chief executive of the retailer\u2019s parent Inter Ikea group, said. \u201cChange will only be possible if we collaborate with others and nurture entrepreneurship. We are committed to taking the lead working together with everyone \u2013 from raw material suppliers all the way to our customers and partners.\u201d The retailer has already invested in windfarms and put solar panels on its stores as part of plans to rely on renewable electricity and heat in its stores by 2020. Ikea\u2019s commitment on plastic comes after Iceland, the grocery chain, said it would ditch plastic packaging on its own brand products by 2023. British MPs have called on other supermarkets to follow suit and eliminate plastic packaging from their products over that period. Tesco has told suppliers it wants to stop using non-recyclable plastic packaging from next year, while Waitrose is phasing out black plastic trays that are hard to recycle. A UN report issued on Tuesday \u2013 World Environment Day \u2013 showed dozens of nations acting to cut plastic, including a ban on plastic bags in Kenya, on styrofoam in Sri Lanka and the use of biodegradable bags in China. A tax on single-use plastic bags in the UK has slashed their use and ministers have banned microbeads in personal hygiene products. However, Theresa May\u2019s pledge to end avoidable plastic waste by the end of 2042 has been criticised as far too slow. The Greenpeace UK oceans campaigner Elena Polisano welcomed the Ikea move and said: \u201cWe now need to see other big retailers come up with ambitious plans to cut the amount of throwaway plastic on their shelves. With one truckload of plastic waste entering our seas every minute and spreading everywhere from the Arctic to the Antarctic and to the deepest point of the ocean, we need bold action \u2013 and fast.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The big six energy supplier SSE has been ordered by regulators to pay out \u00a31m for issuing more than a million misleading statements to vulnerable customers. The energy regulator, Ofgem, said the firm had agreed to put the sum into a consumer redress fund over a bungle that affected 580,000 customers on prepayment meters. The UK-listed company said it deeply regretted the failings, which resulted in households being sent annual statements that had the wrong information on the cheaper tariffs available to them. The documents also included inaccurate estimates of the savings of switching to those deals, meaning customers may have made decisions that ultimately left them out of pocket. Furthermore, some statements showed inflated savings for how much money people would save from switching from a prepayment meter \u2013 coin or card-operated ones usually used by vulnerable households \u2013 to standard meters. The shortcomings were compounded, Ofgem said, by SSE failing to \u201cact promptly to put things right, by not identifying the issue at an early stage and by not escalating action to address it or putting in place appropriate remedial actions\u201d. However, the regulator judged the mishandled statements caused relatively little harm because relatively few customers would have acted on the information and switched. The mistakes were blamed on IT coding errors and lasted for more than a year, from 27 June 2014 to 12 September 2015. Gareth Wood, SSE\u2019s director of customer service operations, said measures were in place to stop the problems happening again. \u201cAlthough we\u2019re disappointed not to have met the high standards expected of us in this instance, we\u2019re pleased that the matter has now been closed with a voluntary payment that will directly benefit vulnerable customers,\u201d he said. SSE, the UK\u2019s second largest supplier, is merging its retail energy business with that of its German rival npower but the deal faces a full-scale investigation by the competition watchdog. The firm was the only one of the big six to improve its standing in a customer service league table, published on Thursday. The ranking, compiled by MoneySavingExpert.com and based on polling of the site\u2019s users, placed SSE seventh out of 16 suppliers. The top spot was taken by the challenger supplier Ovo, while the worst was Iresa, which was recently barred by Ofgem from taking on new customers owing to its service failings.",

      "bodyText": "At least 11,000 jobs are at risk as House of Fraser prepares to close more than half its UK stores and Poundworld teeters on the brink of administration, in the latest blow to the high streets. House of Fraser unveiled a plan designed to stave off collapse which will mean the closure of 31 of its 59 department stores including its Oxford Street flagship in London and its shops in cities including Birmingham, Cardiff and Edinburgh. As many as 6,000 jobs could be lost - 2,000 direct HoF employees and 4,000 who work for in-store concessions. The move by the 169-year-old company is part of a rescue plan that will also lead to House of Fraser moving out of its head offices in London and Glasgow and closing a distribution centre in Milton Keynes where more than 400 more jobs are under threat. Up to 5,000 more jobs are at risk at the 355-store Poundworld chain which on Thursday gave notice that it intends to appoint administrators. The legal process provides court protection from creditors for 10 days while the company attempts to mount a last-ditch rescue. However, even if a buyer comes forward at the 11th hour, they would be expected to close down a large part of the store estate. Poundworld\u2019s private equity owner TPG Capital is understood to be unwilling to pump more cash into the business. TPG said a key reason for Poundworld\u2019s problems was the Brexit blow to sterling, which pushed up the cost of imported goods. The two chains\u2019 difficulties come after a string of retailers and restaurant groups, including Mothercare, Carpetright, New Look, Prezzo and Jamie\u2019s Italian, have announced plans to close hundreds of outlets putting more than 35,000 jobs on the block so far this year. DIY chain Homebase is also expected to close about 60 stores after a \u00a31 rescue takeover by restructuring specialist Hilco which will be completed this month. Alex Williamson, House of Fraser\u2019s chief executive, said that without the proposed store closures the business was likely to collapse. \u201cA decision to close this number of stores is not done lightly. This is really grim,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cIt is a highly emotional, highly regrettable situation that none of us either imagined or wanted to see happen, but there is simply no alternative.\u201d The 31 stores are set to close by early next year. The store chain also wants immediate rent reductions on the stores of 30% under a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency that enables a business to rearrange deals with landlords. House of Fraser is also asking for rents to be cut by 25% at 10 other stores. The CVA requires the approval of three-quarters of creditors at a meeting on 22 June. Outside the Oxford Street store, which has been trading since 1879, Jeanne Bateman from Norwich said: \u201cI\u2019m a big high street shopper. I\u2019m very sad to see so many big high street names closing down. I feel sorry for us the shopper, and very sorry for the people who work here.\u201d Her daughter, Catherine Wilamowska, agreed, but added that because she lives in a small village she does all her shopping online. Wilamowska\u2019s habits reflect a changing world in which about a fifth of all UK retail spending has moved on to the internet. While online specialists such as Amazon, Boohoo and Asos continue to expand rapidly, traditional retailers are struggling to adapt as many are stuck in now unprofitable stores on long and expensive leases. Switching to selling online also requires heavy investment in IT and delivery networks at a time when cost prices have risen as a result in fall of the value of the pound. Many retailers are also facing big increases in business rates, together with higher labour costs as a result of the national minimum wage and apprenticeship levy. At the same time shoppers have reined back spending on clothing and household goods because of a squeeze on spare cash and a shift to renting rather than owning homes. The House of Fraser chairman, Frank Slevin, said: \u201cThe retail industry is undergoing fundamental change and House of Fraser urgently needs to adapt to this fast-changing landscape in order to give it a future and allow it to thrive.\u201d In a presentation to investors, the company admitted it had made mistakes with its website and by cutting back on in-house womenswear brands, but it also blamed Brexit and the fall in the value of the pound for pushing up costs for retailers. House of Fraser said sales slumped by 7.4% at established stores in the year to the end of January and operating profits were down nearly 40% to \u00a319.8m. Dave Gill, national officer at the shopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw, said: \u201cThis is devastating news for House of Fraser employees. We are receiving calls from loyal and long-serving staff who are extremely worried, including those who work in brand concessions and are not directly employed by House of Fraser.\u201d He added that although HoF does not recognise Usdaw, he had asked the retailer \u201cto engage in urgent talks, so that we can challenge the business case, investigate what can be done to save jobs and represent our members\u2019 best interests\u201d. The restructuring and closures are a condition of a deal that will give control of House of Fraser to the Chinese C.banner business, which also owns Hamleys. C.banner is buying a 51% stake in the parent company of the ailing department store group for \u00a3140m, leaving the current owner, Nanjing Cenbest, part of China\u2019s Sanpower conglomerate, with a minority stake. It is feared House of Fraser could struggle to complete the CVA, as landlords and lenders have expressed concerns about a lack of consultation and fears that C.banner will not be able to inject sufficient cash into the business to turn it around. Williamson said management had been forced to take brave decisions, including closing some of its most high-profile stores, to try to ensure the business had a future. \u201cThere are too many case studies of CVAs that have not worked, and this is not going to be one of them,\u201d he said. C.banner has committed to putting \u00a370m into House of Fraser after the restructure which Williamson said would help turn it around. The company has also put another \u00a31m into its pension fund after discussions with trustees, who expressed concerns about protection for savers in the restructure. On Thursday, landlords called for an urgent government review of the rising use of CVAs, which they say risks undermining the UK\u2019s reputation and deters investment in town centres. The British Property Federation said it believed the process was being misused. Melanie Leech, the chief executive of the landlords\u2019 group, said: \u201cThe CVA process is intended to be part of a comprehensive business recovery plan. \u201cProperty owners, looking after savers\u2019 and pensioners\u2019 money, will support businesses who demonstrate this commitment, but must protect those pensioners against unfair action that penalises their interests.\u201d",

By 1941, it had expanded into a number of shops in Scotland and became House of Fraser.</p>\n    <p>The 1950s marked a period of major expansion for House of Fraser. In 1953, still owned by the Fraser family, the group extended its geographic reach across Scotland and into north-east England and Carlisle with the purchase of the Binns chain, which had its origins in an early 19th century Sunderland drapery business. Harrods, the luxury London department store, and Dickins &amp; Jones, became part of the House of Fraser group in the late 1950s.</p>\n    <p>Growth continued in the 1970s, with the addition of well-known names such as Rackhams, the Army &amp; Navy stores and Dingles.</p>\n    <p>Change came in 1985 when the House of Fraser group was bought by the Al Fayed family for \u00a3615m and a new business strategy was announced, with plans to replace smaller branches with larger stores.</p>\n    <p>In 1994 House of Fraser was floated on the London Stock Exchange at a market value of \u00a3484m, with Harrods split off and kept under private ownership by Al Fayed.</p>\n    <p>A takeover bid from Scottish retail entrepreneur Tom Hunter was rejected in 2003 and some branches in Scotland were sold or closed.</p>\n    <p>However, two years later the group was in expansion mode again, buying 16 stores under the Jenners and Beatties brands became part of the group in 2005. Large new store openings followed in 2008 at locations including Belfast, Bristol and the Westfield shopping centre in west London.</p>\n    <p>In 2013, House of Fraser opened its first store overseas, in Abu Dhabi\u2019s World Trade Center shopping mall.<br></p>\n    <p>House of Fraser was bought by China\u2019s Nanjing Xinjiekou Department Store Co \u2013 also known as Nanjing Cenbest \u2013 in 2014. <b>Angela Monaghan</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Alex Williamson, House of Fraser\u2019s chief executive, said that without the proposed store closures the business was likely to collapse.</p> \n<p>\u201cA decision to close this number of stores is not done lightly.

      "bodyText": "A shareholder revolt over executive pay and independence at the Ladbrokes owner, GVC, has forced a director to step down from its remuneration committee. Peter Isola, an expert in gaming law and regulation who joined the board as a non-executive director in 2016, stepped down after the gambling operator came under pressure from shareholders at its annual meeting in Gibraltar on Wednesday. At the meeting, nearly 44% of shareholders voted against the firm\u2019s remuneration report for 2017 and 42.6% opposed the re-election of Isola as a director. All resolutions were passed. Last year, the company saw off a similar pay revolt, when more than 45% of investors failed to support its pay policy. Shareholders objected to the large payouts the company has awarded its chief executive, Kenneth Alexander, and the non-executive chairman, Lee Feldman. Alexander has received \u00a345m in share options since 2016, while Feldman has picked up share options worth \u00a322.5m, thanks to a scheme linked to the firm\u2019s share price, which recently hit an all-time high. GVC has recently taken over Ladbrokes Coral to form a \u00a35bn gambling company, the second biggest in the UK after Paddy Power Betfair. The group, which also owns Foxy Bingo, is due to join the FTSE 100 index of leading companies on Monday. The chair of GVC\u2019s remuneration committee, Jane Anscombe, said the committee was \u201cof course disappointed\u201d by the vote on the remuneration report. \u201cWe acknowledge this feedback and thank those shareholders who have already spoken with us and explained their reasons for not being able to support this resolution,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have sought to balance the views we have heard from shareholders with the clear need to appropriately reward and retain our successful management team, and we are committed to continuing this dialogue with our shareholders.\u201d Shareholder advisory groups had urged investors to vote against GVC\u2019s pay awards and Institutional Shareholder Services had also advised a vote against Isola\u2019s reappointment. Britain\u2019s corporate governance code states that a non-executive director\u2019s independence could be \u201cpotentially impaired\u201d by holding a so-called \u201cmaterial business relationship\u201d. Isola is a senior partner at the Gibraltar-based legal firm Isolas and his independence was questioned because Isolas was paid more than \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3263,000) for advisory work it carried out for GVC in 2017 and 2016.",

      "bodyText": "Thames Water, Britain\u2019s biggest water company, is to pay back \u00a365m to customers as part of a \u00a3120m package of penalties after being castigated by the regulator for its failure to tackle leaks. Ofwat, the watchdog for an industry that is battling calls for renationalisation, found the Thames Water board did not have \u201csufficient oversight and control\u201d of its leakage performance. The \u00a365m payment to customers comes on top of \u00a355m in automatic penalties incurred by the company for failing to fulfil a promise it made to customers to cut leaks. Following Ofwat\u2019s investigation, Thames has agreed to bring forward the payment of these automatic penalties, meaning \u00a3120m will be paid to customers in the form of a rebate of about \u00a315 over the next two years. The money will come from the firm\u2019s shareholders, most of whom are pension funds. Thames Water, which has paid no corporation tax for a decade because its payments are deferred while it makes major investments in infrastructure, reported an operating profit of \u00a3638m last year. It paid out \u00a3100m in dividends to shareholders of its parent company last year, but has since put a freeze on payouts to investors. It is due to publish fresh annual figures later this month. Chief executive Steve Robertson apologised to customers and vowed to put things right, promising that all customers will benefit not only from the rebate but also from further price reductions between 2020-25. Robertson added: \u201cWe met our leakage targets for a decade but our recent performance has not been good enough. We let our customers down and for that we\u2019re sorry. We have taken more control of how we manage the network and are investing significantly more in people and resources to tackle leakage, get back on track and then go beyond.\u201d He said the company was fixing about 1,000 leaks a week and that senior managers would only be rewarded for reducing leaks when targets were hit. The penalty comes only days after the bosses of England\u2019s privatised water companies were criticised by the GMB union for banking \u00a358m in pay and benefits over the last five years while customers have been faced with above-inflation rises in their water bills. Labour has said it would take the water industry into public ownership if Jeremy Corbyn was elected prime minister, and the industry has also attracted criticism from the government. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has called for a crackdown on excessive pay and offshore financial arrangements used by water companies to avoid tax. On Wednesday, he launched a further attack on \u201ccrony capitalists\u201d who had \u201crigged the system\u201d. Ofwat\u2019s investigation found that Thames breached two of its legal obligations through poor leakage management. It concluded that Thames\u2019 board and management did not pay enough attention to reducing leaks and that the company underestimated the significance of its underperformance when assuring Ofwat it was meeting its statutory obligations. Ofwat\u2019s chief executive, Rachel Fletcher, said: \u201cThames Water failed its customers in tackling leakage and the measures we\u2019ve announced today illustrate the scale of the company\u2019s shortcomings and how seriously we take them. \u201cCustomers don\u2019t want to see their water company letting them down like this, but we hope the rebate they will now receive goes some way towards compensating them for their water company\u2019s failure to live up to its commitments to cut leakage.\u201d Ofwat has set all water companies a target of bringing down leakage by at least another 15% up to 2025 and expects further reductions beyond this date. Thames has said it wants to reduce leaks by 50% over the longer term, compared with 2016-17 levels. The company was hit with a record environmental fine of \u00a320.3m last year after huge leaks of untreated sewage into the Thames and its tributaries and on to land, including the popular Thames path. The prolonged leaks led to serious impacts on residents, farmers, and wildlife, killing birds and fish.",

      "bodyText": "Accountants and lawyers will earn \u00a370m managing the fallout from the collapse of Carillion, according to the National Audit Office, with taxpayers expected to foot a bill of more than \u00a3150m. In a report into the government\u2019s handling of the outsourcing company, the NAO said the liquidation of Carillion showed the government had \u201cfurther to go\u201d in understanding the financial health of suppliers whose failure could have major consequences. The NAO estimated that Carillion would end up costing the Cabinet Office at least \u00a3148m but warned the overall cost borne by taxpayers was \u201clikely to be higher\u201d. It cited factors such as potential legal disputes with Carillion clients, the wider impact on the economy and the \u00a312m cost of finding placements for more than 1,000 of its former apprentices. Accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which earned \u00a317m in fees from Carillion in the decade before its demise, is expected to earn a further \u00a350m from managing the insolvency. Lawyers will pick up a further \u00a320m slice of costs that are projected to reach \u00a3566m, offset by an estimated \u00a3317m in income, including from ongoing public and private sector contracts being managed by the Insolvency Service and PwC. Business committee chair Rachel Reeves said the share of total costs made up by PwC\u2019s bill was further evidence of a lack of competition among the so-called big four accounting companies. \u201cThe dice are loaded in the big four\u2019s favour,\u201d the Labour MP said. \u201cThey make a killing in fees advising struggling companies how to turn them round and then they pocket millions tidying up when that advice fails. On Carillion, taxpayers are left to foot the multimillion pound bill for corporate failure.\u201d Reeves\u2019 and Frank Field\u2019s work and pensions committees urged the government to consider breaking up the big four accountants in a joint report into Carillion\u2019s collapse published last month. Field, also a Labour MP, said: \u201cMore money for PwC is less money for sub-contractors and the Pension Protection Fund.\u201d The PPF, the UK\u2019s pensions lifeboat, will take over Carillion\u2019s retirement schemes, which have a collective liability of \u00a32.6bn. Tens of thousands of subcontractors who were owed more than \u00a32bn by Carillion when it failed, are slated to get just \u00a3164m according to the NAO. A spokesperson for PwC said it had been appointed to manage \u201ca liquidation of exceptional size and complexity as quickly and effectively as possible\u201d. \u201cWe understand concerns over the cost of the liquidation, however, without this work the cost to UK jobs, the economy and the taxpayer would be considerably higher.\u201d Field said the NAO\u2019s report also showed that Carillion had \u201choodwinked\u201d the government into believing its finances were in good shape up until a shock profit warning in July last year. He pointed to a section of the report that detailed major failings with Carillion contracts in the UK, which he said cast doubt on evidence given by former directors that the company\u2019s woes were down to its \u201cmore exotic forays overseas\u201d. The report listed serious problems that sent costs spiralling on multimillion pound projects such as the \u00a3335m Royal Liverpool university hospital and \u00a3350m Metropolitan Midland hospital, both of which have been on hold since Carillion\u2019s insolvency. Jon Trickett, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said the mounting cost to the taxpayer of Carillion\u2019s failure was down to an over reliance on private companies to provide public services. \u201cThe government\u2019s dogmatic commitment to the failed outsourcing ideology blinded it to the large risks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Tories were more concerned about the commercial interests of big business than protecting taxpayers\u2019 money or public services. \u201cThe Tories pretend it is the bosses who will pay the price, but with 2,340 jobs lost and the public footing at least a \u00a3148m bill that is clearly not the case. \u201cIn government, Labour would end this racket, and would introduce a presumption in favour of bringing contracts back in-house.\u201d A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office said: \u201c\u201dThroughout this process, the government has been clear that its priority is to ensure that public services continue to run smoothly and safely. \u201cThe plans we put in place have ensured this, and we continue to work hard to minimise the impacts of the insolvency, having safeguarded over 11,700 jobs to date.\u201d While nearly 12,000 staff have been transferred to new employers, 2,332 people have been made redundant and a further 3,000 are still working for the remnants of the company under the auspices of the Insolvency Service and face an uncertain future.",
