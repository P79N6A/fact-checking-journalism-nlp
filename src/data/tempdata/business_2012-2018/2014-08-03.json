      "bodyText": "Portugal injected almost \u20ac5bn into Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo on Sunday night to stave off the collapse of the country's biggest bank following a series of financial scandals. Carlos Costa, governor of the Bank of Portugal, said the bank's healthy businesses would be spun off into a \"good\" bank, while its toxic assets would be hived off into a \"bad\" bank. The bailout plan, which was agreed with Brussels, was sparked by the far bigger than expected \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) net loss reported last week by the bank. The loss wiped out its capital buffers and sent its shares falling by more than 75% before the stock was suspended on Friday. Esp\u00edrito Santo is expected to be delisted from the Lisbon stock exchange, meaning that shareholders will be wiped out. Costa said the injection of money would come mostly from Portugal's international bailout, which made \u20ac6.4bn available for bank recapitalisation through a fund set up by Portugal in 2012. The fund is aimed at limiting the political fallout from using taxpayers' money to prop up a bank at a time when Portugal is only just emerging from a deep economic downturn. Pedro Passos Coelho, the prime minister, had pledged that taxpayers would not be called on to bail out failing banks. The \"bad\" bank will hold the troubled assets, mostly related to its exposure to the Esp\u00edrito Santo family, which has faced difficulties after financial irregularities were uncovered at one of its array of holding companies last year. An audit ordered by the Portuguese central bank earlier this year discovered material irregularities at the Luxembourg-registered ESI, part of the empire. Ricardo Esp\u00edrito Santo Salgado, the chief executive of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, was forced to resign and he was detained last month in connection with an investigation into money laundering and tax evasion. Santo Salgado was understood to have been a voluntary witness and said in January 2013 that he had always paid his taxes. The central bank ordered the bank to raise more capital, but potential investors were deterred by the publicity surrounding the allegations facing the wider group and the prospect of more impairments being revealed in the future. Portugal was bailed out by the EU and International Monetary Fund with \u20ac78bn in 2011, but left the rescue programme in May. That has given the country more freedom, although it is still bound by requirements to reduce its budget deficit. It still has \u20ac6.4bn left from the original \u20ac12bn put aside to recapitalise the banking industry. The fund is financed by all banks in Portugal and has representatives of the country's central bank and the government on its board. Last month, concerns about the bank rattled European financial markets.",

The consensus is that rates will not rise until early 2015, but polling by Reuters last week found that economists expect a first voice or two on the nine-strong MPC to call for a rate rise this week. \"We expect the jobless rate will continue to fall rapidly, with the Bank hiking earlier and further than markets project,\" said Michael Saunders, the chief UK economist at Citi. The MPC's voting pattern will only become public when minutes are released two weeks after the meeting. The US Federal Reserve has just registered its first dissenter, with the hawkish Charles Plosser saying the commitment to keep rates near zero for a considerable time did not reflect the gains made by the economy. The UK economy is expanding at an annual rate in excess of 3% and unemployment is declining, but the absence of wage pressure means there is no immediate reason to act. The MPC meeting comes as separate surveys illustrate how, even with the economy performing strongly again, not all elements are functioning evenly. Bank lending to the private sector still lags far behind the G7 average, despite government efforts to boost the availability of credit, according to a new study by the accountants UHY Hacker Young. Private sector credit volumes were down by 2.2% in real terms in the last year, while average lending across the G7 economies increased by 0.1% in real terms. Laurence Sacker, a partner at Hacker Young, said: \"Nearly six years on from the start of the banking crisis, we are still seeing virtually no increase in bank lending in the UK \u2026 Demand for loans is increasing, but the banks are generally not granting new requests unless they are from existing customers with a good track record and security.\" A business confidence index produced by the Institute of Chartered Accountants and accounting firm Grant Thornton showed the first decline in two years, albeit still close to an all-time high. The index stands at +32.3 in the third quarter, of 2014 compared with +37.3 in the second quarter . The economy is expected to expand by 0.9.% in the third quarter, but the pace of growth may slow down in the final quarter of this year.",

    "webTitle": "Sir Robin Ibbs obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Robin Ibbs, who has died aged 88, made his mark in three very distinct areas. He was a senior director of ICI, became the respected head of Margaret Thatcher's thinktank, responsible for changes that reshaped the civil service, and following that an unexpected, and unexpectedly successful, chairman of Lloyds Bank, later Lloyds TSB. Born in Birmingham, he was the son of TL (Thomas) Ibbs, a professor of physics at Birmingham University, and his wife Marjorie (nee Bell). He went to Gresham's school in Norfolk, and was sent during the second world war to Canada, where his education continued at Upper Canada college in Toronto, and Toronto University. He returned to the UK to read mechanical sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge. National service in the Royal Navy (1947-49) brought him the rank of instructor lieutenant. He then joined the heavy engineering company CA Parsons on a graduate apprenticeship, before entering ICI's Millbank head office in London in 1952 in the technical and work study departments. From there he went to the chief engineer's department of ICI's general chemicals division before making his career in the metals division, later IMI, back in Birmingham. After engineering, technical and general management appointments, he made his reputation as planning manager (1969-74), before being promoted to executive director and then summoned back to Millbank as general manager of planning in 1974. His clarity, logical mind and ability to evaluate projects of all kinds impressed the board, and two years later he was invited to join them as director with responsibility for planning, involved with a clutch of policy groups that covered the key divisions. At the same time, Ibbs developed important links with the International Chamber of Commerce, the CBI and the Industrial Development Advisory Board. The 1970s had been uncomfortable for ICI. It had variously tried a \"dash for growth\", expensive and ultimately futile downstream investments in textiles, and major international expansion. Ibbs was involved in discussions led by Sir Maurice Hodgson, who became chairman in 1978, about restructuring the sprawling company and its board, which came to fruition under Hodgson's successor, Sir John Harvey-Jones. But Ibbs' analytical abilities were noticed elsewhere, and in 1980 he was seconded to the Cabinet Office as head of the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS). His two-year term coincided with an economic recession that saw ICI lose a third of its customer base, and Ibbs was a player in the tortuous negotiations to bail out another British industrial icon, British Leyland. Very much a big company player, he followed the Thatcher lead, and the CPRS became less radical under his management. He was, as one commentator put it, \"a closed government man\" resisting dealings with the media even when a perceptive report might redound to the thinktank's credit. But he was noted for his persistence, and after important work on managing the nationalised industries and resisting a coal strike, he was asked to be the prime minister's part-time adviser on efficiency soon after ICI asked him to return in 1982, the year he was knighted. By now Harvey-Jones was chairman, with a mandate for change. Ibbs was a vital supporter as the company regrouped, slashing the size of its board and starting to shift its emphasis away from heavy chemicals to speciality applications and pharmaceuticals. Results followed as it became the first British company to make a profit of \u00a31bn. Ibbs' official role was public affairs in the UK and planning matters, and he increasingly built up his outside network. Ironically, he also had oversight of the press function. When told by the BBC of a list of instances where the company had refused to cooperate, he taxed the press office for an explanation, only to be reminded that he had instigated most of the refusals. Ibbs' outstanding achievement as Thatcher's efficiency adviser was to push through the major changes in the civil service. His 1988 Next Steps report, which took just 90 working days to complete and cost \u00a350,000, has been described as the most far-reaching change to the civil service since the reforms of the 1870s. In essence it sought to detach the operations of services from the formulation of policy and led to the hiving off of departmental responsibilities to what have now become a plethora of quasi-independent bodies from the Inland Revenue to Jobcentre Plus, the Prison Service or the Passport Office. An initially sceptical Thatcher was persuaded to back it by Lord (David) Young, and its logic has continued to roll remorselessly through, changing the face of Whitehall. Ibbs' third career opened up when he joined the board of Lloyds Bank in 1985, taking the post of deputy chairman, traditionally held by one of Lloyds' big industrial customers, three years later when he retired from ICI. Five years on, when Sir Jeremy Morse retired as chairman, the bank had failed in two high-profile mergers, with Midland Bank and the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. Directors turned to Ibbs as a safe pair of hands. A year older than Morse, even he saw himself as a stop-gap chairman. In the event, he stayed for four years, during which the value of the company rose from \u00a37bn to \u00a325bn. Along the way he effected mergers with Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and the TSB, and avoided the mistakes rival banks made with overseas expansion. Ibbs was the first to emphasise that he was no banker and left operations to the chief executive, the formidably capable Brian Pitman. But the two worked closely, and Ibbs' judgment was much sought. Ibbs' unflappability came into its own at rowdy annual general meetings when the board was challenged by protesters including, on one occasion, \"ethical streakers\" complaining about developing nations' debt. Ibbs' formidable presence, reinforced by prominent mutton-chop whiskers and a gruff manner, belied an underlying kindness which his colleagues and staff remarked on. It could be demonstrated by painstaking research for the right medical consultant for an acquaintance or a cash gift to help a young person's studies. His wife Iris, nee Hall, whom he married in 1952, suffered long periods of ill-health, requiring a wheelchair at about the time Ibbs retired from ICI. He became her carer, limiting his hours at Lloyds strictly, avoiding overnight stays out of London and preparing her meals himself before his 8.30am arrival in the office. He continued his scientific and horticultural interests. A fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society, he was chairman of the council of University College London (1989-95) after serving on the court of the Cranfield Institute of Technology (1983-88). He enjoyed collecting paintings, particularly portraits, though he said he could never afford \"the real stuff\". After leaving Lloyds TSB in 1997, he retired to his house at Salisbury, but the government still came calling, and he was back in action in the 1998 inquiry into arms for Sierra Leone. Iris died in 2005, and the following year he married Penelope Buckland. She survives him, as do his daughter, Caroline, from his first marriage, and his grandson, Alexander. \u2022 John Robin Ibbs, company director, born 21 April 1926; died 27 July 2014",

He was a senior director of ICI, became the respected head of Margaret Thatcher's thinktank, responsible for changes that reshaped the civil service, and following that an unexpected, and unexpectedly successful, chairman of Lloyds Bank, later Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>Born in Birmingham, he was the son of TL (Thomas) Ibbs, a professor of physics at Birmingham University, and his wife Marjorie (nee Bell). He went to Gresham's school in Norfolk, and was sent during the second world war to Canada, where his education continued at Upper Canada college in Toronto, and Toronto University. He returned to the UK to read mechanical sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge.</p> <p>National service in the Royal Navy (1947-49) brought him the rank of instructor lieutenant. He then joined the heavy engineering company CA Parsons on a graduate apprenticeship, before entering ICI's Millbank head office in London in 1952 in the technical and work study departments.</p> <p>From there he went to the chief engineer's department of ICI's general chemicals division before making his career in the metals division, later IMI, back in Birmingham. After engineering, technical and general management appointments, he made his reputation as planning manager (1969-74), before being promoted to executive director and then summoned back to Millbank as general manager of planning in 1974.</p> <p>His clarity, logical mind and ability to evaluate projects of all kinds impressed the board, and two years later he was invited to join them as director with responsibility for planning, involved with a clutch of policy groups that covered the key divisions. At the same time, Ibbs developed important links with the International Chamber of Commerce, the CBI and the Industrial Development Advisory Board.</p> <p>The 1970s had been uncomfortable for ICI. It had variously tried a \"dash for growth\", expensive and ultimately futile downstream investments in textiles, and major international expansion. Ibbs was involved in discussions led by Sir Maurice Hodgson, who became chairman in 1978, about restructuring the sprawling company and its board, which came to fruition under Hodgson's successor, Sir John Harvey-Jones.</p> <p>But Ibbs' analytical abilities were noticed elsewhere, and in 1980 he was seconded to the Cabinet Office as head of the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS). His two-year term coincided with an economic recession that saw ICI lose a third of its customer base, and Ibbs was a player in the tortuous negotiations to bail out another British industrial icon, British Leyland.</p> <p>Very much a big company player, he followed the Thatcher lead, and the CPRS became less radical under his management. He was, as one commentator put it, \"a closed government man\" resisting dealings with the media even when a perceptive report might redound to the thinktank's credit. But he was noted for his persistence, and after important work on managing the nationalised industries and resisting a coal strike, he was asked to be the prime minister's part-time adviser on efficiency soon after ICI asked him to return in 1982, the year he was knighted.</p> <p>By now Harvey-Jones was chairman, with a mandate for change. Ibbs was a vital supporter as the company regrouped, slashing the size of its board and starting to shift its emphasis away from heavy chemicals to speciality applications and pharmaceuticals. Results followed as it became the first British company to make a profit of \u00a31bn.</p> <p>Ibbs' official role was public affairs in the UK and planning matters, and he increasingly built up his outside network. Ironically, he also had oversight of the press function. When told by the BBC of a list of instances where the company had refused to cooperate, he taxed the press office for an explanation, only to be reminded that he had instigated most of the refusals.</p> <p>Ibbs' outstanding achievement as Thatcher's efficiency adviser was to push through the major changes in the civil service. His 1988 Next Steps report, which took just 90 working days to complete and cost \u00a350,000, has been described as the most far-reaching change to the civil service since the reforms of the 1870s. In essence it sought to detach the operations of services from the formulation of policy and led to the hiving off of departmental responsibilities to what have now become a plethora of quasi-independent bodies from the Inland Revenue to Jobcentre Plus, the Prison Service or the Passport Office.</p> <p>An initially sceptical Thatcher was persuaded to back it by Lord (David) Young, and its logic has continued to roll remorselessly through, changing the face of Whitehall.</p> <p>Ibbs' third career opened up when he joined the board of Lloyds Bank in 1985, taking the post of deputy chairman, traditionally held by one of Lloyds' big industrial customers, three years later when he retired from ICI. Five years on, when Sir Jeremy Morse retired as chairman, the bank had failed in two high-profile mergers, with Midland Bank and the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. Directors turned to Ibbs as a safe pair of hands.</p> <p>A year older than Morse, even he saw himself as a stop-gap chairman. In the event, he stayed for four years, during which the value of the company rose from \u00a37bn to \u00a325bn. Along the way he effected mergers with Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and the TSB, and avoided the mistakes rival banks made with overseas expansion.</p> <p>Ibbs was the first to emphasise that he was no banker and left operations to the chief executive, the formidably capable <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/11/sir-brian-pitman-obituary\" title=\"Brian Pitman obituary\">Brian Pitman</a>. But the two worked closely, and Ibbs' judgment was much sought. Ibbs' unflappability came into its own at rowdy annual general meetings when the board was challenged by protesters including, on one occasion, \"ethical streakers\" complaining about developing nations' debt.</p> <p>Ibbs' formidable presence, reinforced by prominent mutton-chop whiskers and a gruff manner, belied an underlying kindness which his colleagues and staff remarked on. It could be demonstrated by painstaking research for the right medical consultant for an acquaintance or a cash gift to help a young person's studies.</p> <p>His wife Iris, nee Hall, whom he married in 1952, suffered long periods of ill-health, requiring a wheelchair at about the time Ibbs retired from ICI. He became her carer, limiting his hours at Lloyds strictly, avoiding overnight stays out of London and preparing her meals himself before his 8.30am arrival in the office.</p> <p>He continued his scientific and horticultural interests. A fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society, he was chairman of the council of University College London (1989-95) after serving on the court of the Cranfield Institute of Technology (1983-88). He enjoyed collecting paintings, particularly portraits, though he said he could never afford \"the real stuff\".</p> <p>After leaving Lloyds TSB in 1997, he retired to his house at Salisbury, but the government still came calling, and he was back in action in the 1998 inquiry into arms for Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Iris died in 2005, and the following year he married Penelope Buckland. She survives him, as do his daughter, Caroline, from his first marriage, and his grandson, Alexander.</p> <p>\u2022 John Robin Ibbs, company director, born 21 April 1926; died 27 July 2014</p>",

Douglas Flint is asking the government not to force banks to comply with new rules requiring them to \"ringfence\" their high street businesses from their casino investment banking arms while the industry undergoes a competition investigation. The chairman of Britain's biggest bank, which is scheduled to publish first half results showing a drop in profits on Monday, has written to the chancellor, George Osborne, and senior regulators to make his views known. The ringfencing requirements are a key plank of the reform ideas drawn up by the independent commission on banking, chaired by Sir John Vickers, The commission reported in 2011 after being set up by the coalition government when it was first formed in 2010. But HSBC \u2013 which would not comment on the report by Sky News \u2013 is concerned that the reorganisation this will require by 2019 is taking place at the same time the Competition and Markets Authority conducts an investigation into the industry which could also require and lead to structural changes. In his letter, Flint is said to be concerned that the possibility that the CMA could recommend further structural changes that would make it difficult to plan for the future of the bank's UK operations. The CMA is currently calling for responses to its provisional conclusion \u2013 announced last month \u2013 that both small business and personal current account customers get a poor service from their banks and cannot tell the difference between products provided by the main players. The watchdog expects any investigation to take 18 months. Vickers had recommended that such an investigation take place in 2015 after calling on the industry to devise a system for switching current accounts in seven days \u2013 which was introduced last September \u2013 to encourage competition. The Treasury declined to comment on the intervention by Flint, who also sent his letter to governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney and deputy governor Andrew Bailey Flint supports the idea of the ringfence and for efforts by the parliament commission on banking standards for it to be \"electrified\" \u2013 forcing a breakup of a bank which fails to comply. Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie who chaired the commission and chairs the Treasury select committee is also said to have received the letter. HSBC, which according to City forecasts is expected to report a fall in half year profits to $12.5bn (\u00a37.5bn) from $14bn a year ago, is reporting in the same week as Standard Chartered, which like HSBC conducts much of its business in emerging markets. Standard Chartered has already warned the City its profits will by 20% and has been the subject of speculation that shareholders are calling for changes to its management team \u2013 led by Peter Sands \u2013 which the bank has denied.",

We are talking about the New York office\u2019s unofficial mascot: Spiderman.</p> <p>The walls separating many of the office\u2019s nooks and crannies have been removed, only to be replaced by spiderwebs of sorts that perfectly complement the office\u2019s main mural of Spiderman in various positions as he goes on to save the world. <br></p> <p>The open spaces and multiple murals aren\u2019t there to just foster creativity, but also to remind Spotify employees of the power they hold and the way they can and do affect Spotify users everyday. Turns out, it\u2019s not Peter Parker\u2019s secret identity that appeals to the Swedish startup, but rather his motto, first uttered by Uncle Ben: \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://instagram.com/p/df6kWjoPfb/?modal=true\" data-alt=\"US Money Global Edge Spiderman Spotify\">  <iframe src=\"//instagram.com/p/df6kWjoPfb/embed/\" width=\"460\" height=\"510\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> <figcaption>The New York office Spriderman mural was painted by Kostas Seremetis.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the company loves Peter Parker, it wants to avoid Peter Pan. Spotify doesn\u2019t want to stay a little kid forever.<br></p> <p>Spotify recently unveiled a new design. The need for redesign became apparent 16 months ago when the company \u201cdecided that we need to grow up a little bit,\u201d says Rochelle King, Spotify\u2019s global vice-president of design and user experience. <br></p> <p>King, who has been with Spotify for a year and a half, was previously vice-president of user experience and design at Netflix. After Spotify cleaned up its logo, app icon and type interface, it became apparent that its previous design was a \u201cmess\u201d. It was inconsistent across the various devices on which the company\u2019s music streaming app can be used and the fragmented user experience was problematic.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe thing that was happening was that this was a brand evolving and the product wasn\u2019t evolving. And that was very problematic, because on the outside we looked really nice but then when you actually came in and used the product, it didn\u2019t really match your expectations. We also lacked pretty strong design foundation at that time,\u201d explained King, when we visited the offices as part of the <a href=\"http://conference.99u.com/\">99U Conference</a> on design. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have design principles that were designed that were defined, we didn\u2019t have a strong visual language. We didn\u2019t have a lot of our patterns and guidelines defined either.\u201d</p> <p>While many might find that surprising for a company that\u2019s six years old and as large as Spotify, King attributes it to Spotify\u2019s rapid growth.</p> <p>\u201cOver the course of, I think, two years we grew from 200 people to close to a thousand people. And when you have this kind of rapid growth you don\u2019t always take the time to do this kind of foundational building stuff \u2013 really being clear about what our principles are, what we are defining as our visual identity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really felt like we needed to stop and take stock of where we are at and define some of those things.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://instagram.com/p/dPx93aEt9d/?modal=true\" data-alt=\"US Money Global Edge spiderman spotify mural\">  <iframe src=\"//instagram.com/p/dPxRN1Et8K/embed/\" width=\"460\" height=\"510\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spiderman mural in the Spotify\u2019s office serves to remind employees that \u2018with great power comes great responsibility\u2019.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mainly, the design team decided to listen to its customers and what they heard wasn\u2019t always easy to hear. Especially, when Spotify tried switching to white background.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My God, how long does it take? Change it back. I used love chilling to Spotify with the black background. It\u2019s now far too bright. How long does it take, you idiots?\u201d</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Still stuck with the terrible white background. Thanks for listening Spotify. I am about to quit this service because looking at your pages gives me terrible headaches.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cWe were constantly seeing these things and not feeling so great about it,\u201d King said, pointing to the comments above. \u201cAnd the pain was, not just external, but of course internally within the design team we felt a lot of the pain as well.\u201d<br></p> <p>After her presentation to the 99U attendees, we caught up with King to talk about the redesign process, what it meant for her team and how Spotify approaches its data.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1I6-wv0p8k\" data-alt=\"US Money Spotify new look Global Edge\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/V1I6-wv0p8k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>Excerpt from King\u2019s presentation </strong><strong> on the Spotify redesign process: </strong></p> <p>Anytime you kick off a project, you start by defining the problem and defining what you actually want to accomplish, what you need to do. For us, it was these three things: One, we needed to bring the brand into the product. We really felt that that refreshed logo and typeface and all those things weren\u2019t reflected inside the product. [Two], we wanted to make sure we created our own look and feel, something that we felt was unique to us or at least was a good representation of what we wanted to be. [Three], we also wanted to make sure that we were unified across all of those different platforms.</p> <p>At Spotify, we use a pretty standard product development cycle process, which is four steps. Think it \u2013 where you are basically exploring a lot of ideas, picking a direction and then going in it. A lot of things actually die at this stage. There\u2019s a lot of ideas that you find out just aren\u2019t that valid or just aren\u2019t that good and so you stop working on them at this stage. Then you actually move into build it stage. Before you were really rolling up your sleeves and actually making thing, now you actually have the intent to have this launch out to real customers. </p> <p>The third stage is shipping it. This when it\u2019s actually going to real users and we always start with a small percent to make sure we are not screwing anything up and we understand how people are reacting to it. But shipping to us is anytime an actual user can play with the product and use it. And then finally, once it gets launched all the way, we go into this tweak it phase, where we are really trying to make that we are reacting to whatever we are hearing and then fixing any issues that come up and optimising it even further. </p> <p>One thing to mention is that this cycle doesn\u2019t just happen once. Ideally, you\u2019re sort of rinsing and repeating a couple of times, because you will find that you optimise, optimise, optimise, and you\u2019ll sort of hit one of those local maximums. Then you need to take a step back and say, \u201cOK, if we actually rethought how radio works, or if we rethink how some of these things work, could we make it even better?\u201d We kind of go through that cycle a couple of times.</p> <p><strong>Excerpt from King\u2019s presentation </strong><strong> on the role of data in redesign process: </strong></p> <p>One thing, I want to be clear about is that data actually does equal people. I believe sometimes data, especially in the design community, can have a bit of a bad name because it feels like it\u2019s dehumanising design or it\u2019s taking the art out of the process of designing. For me, one thing I really try to remember is that this data is actually information about how real people are using our product. You always have to tie it back to the fact that what we are measuring is human behaviour. </p> <p>If you start to reduce it down to a number, then it\u2019s too easy to forget about what you are actually doing to your customers. And that\u2019s dangerous. The important thing to remember is data is always a representation of how people are using your product and the way that you structure the kind of data you look for or the kind of metrics that you try to get should reflect that. </p> <p>Data actually helps us hone our instinct. Hopefully, we are not just looking at data in a slice of time and making a decision and then, that\u2019s it. We forget about it. Hopefully we are learning all along the way and continually building up that knowledge base and trying to hone our instinct about what customers do over time. </p> <p>There have definitely been times when you have a certain gut or an instinct about how customers might react to your design, you actually test it out there, you say, \u201cHey, I was actually a little bit wrong. They didn\u2019t do quite like I expected. They did it a little differently.\u201d You should capture that information. Keep it and then use it to hone your instinct so that the next time you need to make the same kind of a design decision, you understand how people might react. Also, recognising that things are changing all the time. Things that worked a certain way two years ago might not work the same way now. And so it\u2019s always important to hone your instinct over time. </p> <p>We also have to recognise that we are not like our users. We are all very tech-savvy and we are all very into music. I happen to be into totally shitty teen pop music, but that\u2019s OK. We are all into music, but I can guarantee that not all of our customers listen to the kind of music that I do, or use the product in the same way that I do. Data can help make sure that we stay true to that, to what our real users are doing. </p> <p>Data is just one of many tools that you use throughout the design process. There is experience there\u2019s all these other things, so just remember to keep it in balance with everything else. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fe0bbdb1-5a11-4f70-a49d-f2887d00708e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/2/1399064026369/e887d593-224e-4636-b7ee-bc7ef80fa1da-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"US Money spotify iphone playing \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many Spotify users listen to their music on the go. Photograph: Courtesy of Spotify</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>I love how the walls in your office have been replaced by spiderwebs. I was told it helps encourage creativity and open communications. </strong></p> <p>One thing about Spotify, it is a Swedish company. The founders are Swedish. So there are actually a lot of things about Swedish culture that end up permeating the company. For example, Swedes are actually very collaborative and that\u2019s something that\u2019s part of the culture here. Also, Swedish culture is not very hierarchical. They are conscientiously not hierarchical and so there\u2019s this strong belief that anyone can talk to Daniel any time, that anyone can come up with a good idea. </p> <p>There\u2019s a lot of things about those foundations in culture that totally permeate how we work and what the company culture is. </p> <p><strong>In your presentation, you mentioned that the redesign was basically a team-building exercise. How did that happen? </strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a couple of things. One is that every single designer had to work on that. Every single designer had to touch redesign in some way. Either because their area was being affected \u2013 because [the redesign] went across the entire product. The way our designers are structured, they have a squad they are associated with. So you have a designer that\u2019s associated with the social squad or the designer that\u2019s associated with the discover squad. And each of those designers had to help apply that new look and feel to their area. So every single designer had to touch it and be aware of what was going on. In that way, I think they all feel that they have contributed to the redesign and really crafted it. </p> <p>I think that\u2019s great, because sometimes redesigns happen with one or two designers off in a room and they just do it and then they dictate out. For us, it really was something that entire team feedbacked on, collaborated on and worked with. We had a very tight collaboration not just within product but also with marketing team for the brand prospectives. </p> <p>I do feel like we were all painfully aware how fragmented the experience was across all the devices and so when we launched it, I think you could instantly feel more pride in the product. We knew that we were working on it for months, but when you still walk out there in the world and your friends are like \u201cOh, you work at Spotify? What\u2019s up with the design?\u201d and you are like \u201cYeah, trust me. It\u2019ll get better.\u201d It\u2019s hard, as a designer. When we launched that new design, it was really exciting for everyone on the team because we were like \u201cNow we can show the world what we have been working on\u201d and feel happy with it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://instagram.com/p/o1NpkFNflj/?modal=true\" data-alt=\"US Money Global Edge Spotify stats\">  <iframe src=\"//instagram.com/p/o1NpkFNflj/embed/\" width=\"460\" height=\"510\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> <figcaption>Recently, Spotify celebrated its <a href=\"http://spotify-10million.com/?utm_source=general&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=general_topical_all&amp;utm_content=all501039\">10m subscribers and 40m listeners</a>. </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You mentioned that it\u2019s important to interpret data as people\u2019s experience with the product.

      "bodyText": "Spotify\u2019s New York office is any teenage boy\u2019s dream. We are not talking just about the obvious perks of working for a hip startup or the array of cool musicians parading through the office. We are talking about the New York office\u2019s unofficial mascot: Spiderman. The walls separating many of the office\u2019s nooks and crannies have been removed, only to be replaced by spiderwebs of sorts that perfectly complement the office\u2019s main mural of Spiderman in various positions as he goes on to save the world. The open spaces and multiple murals aren\u2019t there to just foster creativity, but also to remind Spotify employees of the power they hold and the way they can and do affect Spotify users everyday. Turns out, it\u2019s not Peter Parker\u2019s secret identity that appeals to the Swedish startup, but rather his motto, first uttered by Uncle Ben: \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d While the company loves Peter Parker, it wants to avoid Peter Pan. Spotify doesn\u2019t want to stay a little kid forever. Spotify recently unveiled a new design. The need for redesign became apparent 16 months ago when the company \u201cdecided that we need to grow up a little bit,\u201d says Rochelle King, Spotify\u2019s global vice-president of design and user experience. King, who has been with Spotify for a year and a half, was previously vice-president of user experience and design at Netflix. After Spotify cleaned up its logo, app icon and type interface, it became apparent that its previous design was a \u201cmess\u201d. It was inconsistent across the various devices on which the company\u2019s music streaming app can be used and the fragmented user experience was problematic. \u201cThe thing that was happening was that this was a brand evolving and the product wasn\u2019t evolving. And that was very problematic, because on the outside we looked really nice but then when you actually came in and used the product, it didn\u2019t really match your expectations. We also lacked pretty strong design foundation at that time,\u201d explained King, when we visited the offices as part of the 99U Conference on design. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have design principles that were designed that were defined, we didn\u2019t have a strong visual language. We didn\u2019t have a lot of our patterns and guidelines defined either.\u201d While many might find that surprising for a company that\u2019s six years old and as large as Spotify, King attributes it to Spotify\u2019s rapid growth. \u201cOver the course of, I think, two years we grew from 200 people to close to a thousand people. And when you have this kind of rapid growth you don\u2019t always take the time to do this kind of foundational building stuff \u2013 really being clear about what our principles are, what we are defining as our visual identity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really felt like we needed to stop and take stock of where we are at and define some of those things.\u201d Mainly, the design team decided to listen to its customers and what they heard wasn\u2019t always easy to hear. Especially, when Spotify tried switching to white background. My God, how long does it take? Change it back. I used love chilling to Spotify with the black background. It\u2019s now far too bright. How long does it take, you idiots?\u201d Still stuck with the terrible white background. Thanks for listening Spotify. I am about to quit this service because looking at your pages gives me terrible headaches.\u201d \u201cWe were constantly seeing these things and not feeling so great about it,\u201d King said, pointing to the comments above. \u201cAnd the pain was, not just external, but of course internally within the design team we felt a lot of the pain as well.\u201d After her presentation to the 99U attendees, we caught up with King to talk about the redesign process, what it meant for her team and how Spotify approaches its data. Excerpt from King\u2019s presentation on the Spotify redesign process: Anytime you kick off a project, you start by defining the problem and defining what you actually want to accomplish, what you need to do. For us, it was these three things: One, we needed to bring the brand into the product. We really felt that that refreshed logo and typeface and all those things weren\u2019t reflected inside the product. [Two], we wanted to make sure we created our own look and feel, something that we felt was unique to us or at least was a good representation of what we wanted to be. [Three], we also wanted to make sure that we were unified across all of those different platforms. At Spotify, we use a pretty standard product development cycle process, which is four steps. Think it \u2013 where you are basically exploring a lot of ideas, picking a direction and then going in it. A lot of things actually die at this stage. There\u2019s a lot of ideas that you find out just aren\u2019t that valid or just aren\u2019t that good and so you stop working on them at this stage. Then you actually move into build it stage. Before you were really rolling up your sleeves and actually making thing, now you actually have the intent to have this launch out to real customers. The third stage is shipping it. This when it\u2019s actually going to real users and we always start with a small percent to make sure we are not screwing anything up and we understand how people are reacting to it. But shipping to us is anytime an actual user can play with the product and use it. And then finally, once it gets launched all the way, we go into this tweak it phase, where we are really trying to make that we are reacting to whatever we are hearing and then fixing any issues that come up and optimising it even further. One thing to mention is that this cycle doesn\u2019t just happen once. Ideally, you\u2019re sort of rinsing and repeating a couple of times, because you will find that you optimise, optimise, optimise, and you\u2019ll sort of hit one of those local maximums. Then you need to take a step back and say, \u201cOK, if we actually rethought how radio works, or if we rethink how some of these things work, could we make it even better?\u201d We kind of go through that cycle a couple of times. Excerpt from King\u2019s presentation on the role of data in redesign process: One thing, I want to be clear about is that data actually does equal people. I believe sometimes data, especially in the design community, can have a bit of a bad name because it feels like it\u2019s dehumanising design or it\u2019s taking the art out of the process of designing. For me, one thing I really try to remember is that this data is actually information about how real people are using our product. You always have to tie it back to the fact that what we are measuring is human behaviour. If you start to reduce it down to a number, then it\u2019s too easy to forget about what you are actually doing to your customers. And that\u2019s dangerous. The important thing to remember is data is always a representation of how people are using your product and the way that you structure the kind of data you look for or the kind of metrics that you try to get should reflect that. Data actually helps us hone our instinct. Hopefully, we are not just looking at data in a slice of time and making a decision and then, that\u2019s it. We forget about it. Hopefully we are learning all along the way and continually building up that knowledge base and trying to hone our instinct about what customers do over time. There have definitely been times when you have a certain gut or an instinct about how customers might react to your design, you actually test it out there, you say, \u201cHey, I was actually a little bit wrong. They didn\u2019t do quite like I expected. They did it a little differently.\u201d You should capture that information. Keep it and then use it to hone your instinct so that the next time you need to make the same kind of a design decision, you understand how people might react. Also, recognising that things are changing all the time. Things that worked a certain way two years ago might not work the same way now. And so it\u2019s always important to hone your instinct over time. We also have to recognise that we are not like our users. We are all very tech-savvy and we are all very into music. I happen to be into totally shitty teen pop music, but that\u2019s OK. We are all into music, but I can guarantee that not all of our customers listen to the kind of music that I do, or use the product in the same way that I do. Data can help make sure that we stay true to that, to what our real users are doing. Data is just one of many tools that you use throughout the design process. There is experience there\u2019s all these other things, so just remember to keep it in balance with everything else. I love how the walls in your office have been replaced by spiderwebs. I was told it helps encourage creativity and open communications. One thing about Spotify, it is a Swedish company. The founders are Swedish. So there are actually a lot of things about Swedish culture that end up permeating the company. For example, Swedes are actually very collaborative and that\u2019s something that\u2019s part of the culture here. Also, Swedish culture is not very hierarchical. They are conscientiously not hierarchical and so there\u2019s this strong belief that anyone can talk to Daniel any time, that anyone can come up with a good idea. There\u2019s a lot of things about those foundations in culture that totally permeate how we work and what the company culture is. In your presentation, you mentioned that the redesign was basically a team-building exercise. How did that happen? It\u2019s a couple of things. One is that every single designer had to work on that. Every single designer had to touch redesign in some way. Either because their area was being affected \u2013 because [the redesign] went across the entire product. The way our designers are structured, they have a squad they are associated with. So you have a designer that\u2019s associated with the social squad or the designer that\u2019s associated with the discover squad. And each of those designers had to help apply that new look and feel to their area. So every single designer had to touch it and be aware of what was going on. In that way, I think they all feel that they have contributed to the redesign and really crafted it. I think that\u2019s great, because sometimes redesigns happen with one or two designers off in a room and they just do it and then they dictate out. For us, it really was something that entire team feedbacked on, collaborated on and worked with. We had a very tight collaboration not just within product but also with marketing team for the brand prospectives. I do feel like we were all painfully aware how fragmented the experience was across all the devices and so when we launched it, I think you could instantly feel more pride in the product. We knew that we were working on it for months, but when you still walk out there in the world and your friends are like \u201cOh, you work at Spotify? What\u2019s up with the design?\u201d and you are like \u201cYeah, trust me. It\u2019ll get better.\u201d It\u2019s hard, as a designer. When we launched that new design, it was really exciting for everyone on the team because we were like \u201cNow we can show the world what we have been working on\u201d and feel happy with it.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It all kicks off not long after the start of the rugby league game between Rochdale Hornets and Leigh Centurions. There is a melee involving all 26 players after a Leigh player holds down an opponent and thumps him in the face with a straight right. The culprit gets a yellow card and 10 minutes in the sin bin rather than a red, and the incident seems to knock the stuffing out of the Hornets, who go down to a 72-22 defeat to a team that is fitter, faster and on better money. It is the same story off the pitch. The battle for economic survival is tough and Rochdale is up against rivals who are fit, fast and have more cash to splash. Sitting in the shadows of the Pennines, Rochdale was built on cotton in the 19th century but suffered long-term decline as the mills closed and the manufacturing base shrivelled. In recent years, it has been hit by recession, public spending cuts and scandal. The Rochdale Pioneers paved the way for the co-operative movement and the town was the birthplace of the singer Gracie Fields, but today it is perhaps better known as the place where the MP Cyril Smith preyed on boys. Despite a splendid Victorian gothic town hall, the centre of Rochdale is shabby. Recovery from the recession of 2008-09 is happening much more slowly than in nearby Manchester. There is a limited range of shops, either because of a lack of spending power or because money is being spent elsewhere. Like many other towns and cities, it is chasing inward investment and tourists, and seeking to prevent a brain drain of the skilled and ambitious. It is a tall order, especially against a backdrop of continuing austerity. But Rochdale has things going for it. It has the M62 on its doorstep and a new tram link to central Manchester. Its Kingsway business park is an ideal location for distribution centres, but there are also hi-tech businesses. Mark Lineker, at TBA Electro Conductive Products, says he is running the only company in the world that has so far found a commercial use for the new wonder material graphene. Source Bioscience is a specialist laboratory storage company which houses drugs for pharma companies in temperature and humidity controlled environments. It also makes the fridges used for the storage process and is an example of a company where the distinction between manufacturing and service sector has become blurred. \"Business is strong\", the company's Simon Palmer says. Even in the toughest environments, there are always examples of innovation and excellence. The problem is not that Rochdale lacks good companies, but that it lacks enough of them. It has good jobs, but there are too many of the low skill, low wage variety. The regeneration challenge, in Rochdale as in many other northern towns, is to tilt the balance, to develop a critical mass that will reverse decades of relative decline. That requires a different model from that tried by the last Labour government, which recycled tax receipts from the south to fund an expansion of the public sector in the north. The money helped to improve the town's schools and build a highly regarded new sixth form college, but Simon Danczuk, the town's Labour MP, says the days of government largesse are over. \"The public sector has been dramatically reduced,\" he says. \"Getting Rochdale going in the right direction won't be done through the public sector. It will be done by the private sector, so we have to encourage entrepreneurialism.\" Even so, it's hard to envisage a successful regeneration strategy that does not involve the public sector. One option, quite hard to swallow for a town proud of its independent history, is to see its future as part of a vibrant, successful extended conurbation. Manchester is doing well, and has the potential to drag towns like Rochdale along with it. Further improvements in the transport infrastructure, such as high speed rail three, the plan announced by George Osborne to link towns in the north, would accelerate this process. The council is trying to do its part. It is making improvements to the town centre and is marketing Rochdale as a good place to do business and to live. Richard Farnell, the leader of the council, says more could be done to exploit the fact that the town was the birthplace of the Co-op, John Bright and Fields (\"the Madonna of her day\"). Farnell adds that despite \"the deepest recession in living memory and the worst ravages of the Tory-led coalition, the town is fighting back\". \"We are not a forgotten wasteland, but a proud town with a great history and, I believe, an even greater future. I know all the hard work and painstaking planning of recent years is about to bear huge dividends with increased jobs, skills and prosperity; and a thriving place in which to live, work and play.\" Ultimately, though, regeneration requires an increase in effective demand. The formerly run-down parts of London that are now buzzing have done so through an increase in spending power. Businesses have been created; people with money have been attracted in; wages have been driven up; bars and restaurants have opened up as a consequence. Rochdale has a long way to go before it becomes the new Hoxton, but things could be done to hasten change. Local businesswoman Julie Bowmer says high business rates are contributing to the town centre's problems. \"We have no real high street shops \u2013 not even a Starbucks or a Costa Coffee.\" Danczuk says a Labour government would make a difference through the encouragement of regional banks, higher lending to business, a cut in business rates and the jobs guarantee for young people. But he is dubious about one way of raising demand \u2013 a big increase in the minimum wage. \"I am not convinced about raising the minimum wage dramatically. There would be an impact on the private sector.\" Bowmer is confident the town can make it. \"Rochdale was an industrious town, one of the leaders of the industrial revolution, and it still is an industrious town.

      "body": "<p>It all kicks off not long after the start of the rugby league game between Rochdale Hornets and Leigh Centurions. There is a melee involving all 26 players after a Leigh player holds down an opponent and thumps him in the face with a straight right. The culprit gets a yellow card and 10 minutes in the sin bin rather than a red, and the incident seems to knock the stuffing out of the Hornets, who go down to a 72-22 defeat to a team that is fitter, faster and on better money.</p> <p>It is the same story off the pitch. The battle for economic survival is tough and Rochdale is up against rivals who are fit, fast and have more cash to splash.</p> <p>Sitting in the shadows of the Pennines, Rochdale was built on cotton in the 19th century but suffered long-term decline as the mills closed and the manufacturing base shrivelled.</p> <p>In recent years, it has been hit by recession, public spending cuts and scandal. The Rochdale Pioneers paved the way for the co-operative movement and the town was the birthplace of the singer Gracie Fields, but today it is perhaps better known as the place where the MP Cyril Smith preyed on boys.</p> <p>Despite a splendid Victorian gothic town hall, the centre of Rochdale is shabby. Recovery from the recession of 2008-09 is happening much more slowly than in nearby Manchester.</p> <p>There is a limited range of shops, either because of a lack of spending power or because money is being spent elsewhere. Like many other towns and cities, it is chasing inward investment and tourists, and seeking to prevent a brain drain of the skilled and ambitious.</p> <p>It is a tall order, especially against a backdrop of continuing austerity. But Rochdale has things going for it. It has the M62 on its doorstep and a new tram link to central Manchester. Its Kingsway business park is an ideal location for distribution centres, but there are also hi-tech businesses.</p> <p>Mark Lineker, at TBA Electro Conductive Products, says he is running the only company in the world that has so far found a commercial use for the new wonder material graphene.</p> <p>Source Bioscience is a specialist laboratory storage company which houses drugs for pharma companies in temperature and humidity controlled environments. It also makes the fridges used for the storage process and is an example of a company where the distinction between manufacturing and service sector has become blurred. \"Business is strong\", the company's Simon Palmer says.</p> <p>Even in the toughest environments, there are always examples of innovation and excellence. The problem is not that Rochdale lacks good companies, but that it lacks enough of them. It has good jobs, but there are too many of the low skill, low wage variety. The regeneration challenge, in Rochdale as in many other northern towns, is to tilt the balance, to develop a critical mass that will reverse decades of relative decline.</p> <p>That requires a different model from that tried by the last Labour government, which recycled tax receipts from the south to fund an expansion of the public sector in the north. The money helped to improve the town's schools and build a highly regarded new sixth form college, but Simon Danczuk, the town's Labour MP, says the days of government largesse are over.</p> <p>\"The public sector has been dramatically reduced,\" he says. \"Getting Rochdale going in the right direction won't be done through the public sector. It will be done by the private sector, so we have to encourage entrepreneurialism.\"</p> <p>Even so, it's hard to envisage a successful regeneration strategy that does not involve the public sector. One option, quite hard to swallow for a town proud of its independent history, is to see its future as part of a vibrant, successful extended conurbation. Manchester is doing well, and has the potential to drag towns like Rochdale along with it. Further improvements in the transport infrastructure, such as high speed rail three, the plan announced by George Osborne to link towns in the north, would accelerate this process.</p> <p>The council is trying to do its part. It is making improvements to the town centre and is marketing Rochdale as a good place to do business and to live. Richard Farnell, the leader of the council, says more could be done to exploit the fact that the town was the birthplace of the Co-op, John Bright and Fields (\"the Madonna of her day\").</p> <p>Farnell adds that despite \"the deepest recession in living memory and the worst ravages of the Tory-led coalition, the town is fighting back\". \"We are not a forgotten wasteland, but a proud town with a great history and, I believe, an even greater future. I know all the hard work and painstaking planning of recent years is about to bear huge dividends with increased jobs, skills and prosperity; and a thriving place in which to live, work and play.\"</p> <p>Ultimately, though, regeneration requires an increase in effective demand.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was an unlikely place to find inspiration for the beginning of a multimillion-pound business. But there, stuck behind a glass case in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and having already failed to take off from the shelves of department stores in the United States, Richard Joseph saw what was to become the cornerstone of a new family venture \u2013 a chopping board. Then called the \"No-Spill\" cutting board, the white kitchen aid stood apart in that it could be folded at an angle into a chute so that all the food that was chopped would flow straight into the pot, an idea which had failed to draw the attention of consumers when it was designed about 25 years ago. That same board, in different colours and sizes and with a few design tweaks, is now known as the Chop2Pot and has become a calling card for Joseph Joseph, the British kitchenware brand which reinvents how mixing bowls, tongs and knives look and function. \"It got lost, it didn't stand out in the store,\" said Antony Joseph, the other half of Joseph Joseph and non-identical twin to Richard, who says that the simple chopping board has gone on to sell millions since it became the their first major product to market 10 years ago. Since then the London-based company has grown to over 80 people with 400 products, ranging from a compact tin opener and a square colander to individually coloured boards labelled fish, meat and vegetable, to avoid cross-contamination, and a compact foldable weighing scales. Behind the range is a bid to blend design and fresh functional ideas for everyday products, said Antony. Another hallmark product is the Nest, a collection of bowls and measuring cups which stack inside each other for space saving. \"It is not just about functional ideas. That is key, that is the starting point, but it is how we marry it with a really distinctive aesthetic and colour in a lot of cases and how the two come together and how the product communicates to the consumer so that when people look at it, they get it,\" said Antony, who heads up the design end of the partnership while his brother controls the business side. The pair, both of whom studied design at college, came together in their late 20s to reinvigorate a side of their father's glassware business which was selling glass chopping boards. With new designs \u2013 the glassware is still for sale today \u2013 the pair dropped clocks and plates which were part of their range to focus solely on the kitchen at around the same time as Richard had a eureka moment in New York. Chop and change Other chopping boards such as Cut&amp;Carve, which has grips to hold meat in place and rims around the side to keep in liquids, and the Index coloured boards \u2013 influenced by similar products in industrial kitchens \u2013 were quickly added but failed at the time to interest establishment retailers such as John Lewis. This lack of success pushed the brothers abroad to find new customers elsewhere, in turn opening up fresh markets which now account for 80% of sales. The brothers work with up to 30 designers, half of them in house, to come up with new ideas for products, of which about 40 are launched a year. Each product takes between two and three years to go from idea to being on the shelf, meaning careful planning is necessary in an attempt to spot \"macro-trends\" which will emerge in the future, said Richard. \"It is different with all of the products. Sometimes we will have a very clear idea of what we want and we have identified an opportunity and we will brief that to the designer. Sometimes we will say 'we would like to get into [for example] colanders, we think that colanders will fit well into our range, lets investigate colanders',\" said Antony. Theese products are on mid to high end of the price range. The set of Index chopping boards come in at \u00a348 while a carousel of utensils is \u00a355, although a number of individual utensils come in at under \u00a310. It is unlikely that these will be stocked in the mass market supermarkets, said Antony, although some of the range is available in Waitrose. \"We are happy where we are,\" he says. John Lewis is now their biggest customer in the UK. Counterfeit battles Where the brothers are not happy having to defend their products against counterfeits, some blatant, others having implemented minor alterations. They fought a two-year legal battle in China to get the name Joseph Joseph back after a factory registered it as theirs. British companies have also been found to have copied the products, said Richard. \"The quality is bad and then we start getting customers thinking it is our product and calling our customer service so if you are not on top of it, this can be quite dangerous as far as the brand is concerned.\" Cultural differences have played a part in placing products abroad. They were quickly alerted to the fact that the Japanese generally do not eat cheese or mashed potatoes during a presentation, leaving the potato masher and grater largely redundant - although the brand has proved particularly successful there and in the US out of the 105 countries they now sell in, mostly through third-party distributors. The company is evenly split between the two brothers, who are separated in two different buildings in their Southwark headquarters. Although they have been confined to the kitchen thus far, it is likely that they will soon extend to other parts of the home, said Richard. \"Life is getting faster, whether it is your groceries delivered [or] your Amazon delivery, convenience is just speeding everything up. More and more people are living in cities and therefore space is a premium and an expense. I think when you buy a house, you are buying the luxury of space and so it is a case of can we make life more efficient,\" he said. What makes Joseph Joseph products different Joseph Joseph products are dictated by \"functional ideas and how they are married with the aesthetic\" according to Antony Joseph. Mostly known for their foldable chopping boards, from which vegetables can be tipped into a pan, their nest of bowls and measuring cups and a square colander have also become notable stamps of the company. They are also known for space-saving devices such as utensils which pack neatly on top of each other in a stand, spatulas, palette knifes and ladles that use a weighted handle to avoid being placed on the countertop, thus saving cleaning.",

Each product takes between two and three years to go from idea to being on the shelf, meaning careful planning is necessary in an attempt to spot \"macro-trends\" which will emerge in the future, said Richard.</p> <p>\"It is different with all of the products. Sometimes we will have a very clear idea of what we want and we have identified an opportunity and we will brief that to the designer. Sometimes we will say 'we would like to get into [for example] colanders, we think that colanders will fit well into our range, lets investigate colanders',\" said Antony.</p> <p>Theese products are on mid to high end of the price range. The set of Index chopping boards come in at \u00a348 while a carousel of utensils is \u00a355, although a number of individual utensils come in at under \u00a310. It is unlikely that these will be stocked in the mass market supermarkets, said Antony, although some of the range is available in Waitrose. \"We are happy where we are,\" he says. John Lewis is now their biggest customer in the UK.</p> <h2>Counterfeit battles</h2> <p>Where the brothers are not happy having to defend their products against counterfeits, some blatant, others having implemented minor alterations. They fought a two-year legal battle in China to get the name Joseph Joseph back after a factory registered it as theirs. British companies have also been found to have copied the products, said Richard.</p> <p>\"The quality is bad and then we start getting customers thinking it is our product and calling our customer service so if you are not on top of it, this can be quite dangerous as far as the brand is concerned.\"</p> <p>Cultural differences have played a part in placing products abroad. They were quickly alerted to the fact that the Japanese generally do not eat cheese or mashed potatoes during a presentation, leaving the potato masher and grater largely redundant - although the brand has proved particularly successful there and in the US out of the 105 countries they now sell in, mostly through third-party distributors.</p> <p>The company is evenly split between the two brothers, who are separated in two different buildings in their Southwark headquarters. Although they have been confined to the kitchen thus far, it is likely that they will soon extend to other parts of the home, said Richard.</p> <p>\"Life is getting faster, whether it is your groceries delivered [or] your Amazon delivery, convenience is just speeding everything up. More and more people are living in cities and therefore space is a premium and an expense. I think when you buy a house, you are buying the luxury of space and so it is a case of can we make life more efficient,\" he said.</p> <h2>What makes Joseph Joseph products different</h2> <p>Joseph Joseph products are dictated by \"functional ideas and how they are married with the aesthetic\" according to Antony Joseph. Mostly known for their foldable chopping boards, from which vegetables can be tipped into a pan, their nest of bowls and measuring cups and a square colander have also become notable stamps of the company. They are also known for space-saving devices such as utensils which pack neatly on top of each other in a stand, spatulas, palette knifes and ladles that use a weighted handle to avoid being placed on the countertop, thus saving cleaning.</p>",
