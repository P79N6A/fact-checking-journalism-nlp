    "webTitle": "Davos 2015: World Bank chief makes climate action plea", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The president of the World Bank hasurged the international community to help developing nations cope with a warming planet as the first day of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos was dominated by calls to make 2015 a year of action on climate change. Jim Kim called for rich and poor countries to put aside their differences over tackling climate change as he warned that the hottest year on record in 2014 was evidence of accelerating global warming. \u201cWe are seeing the accelerated impact of climate change. Last year was the hottest on record. That matters. Extreme weather is real. It\u2019s a complete no brainer to move towards cleaner more liveable cities,\u201d said Kim. He was speaking to the Guardian after Al Gore launched an initiative to get the world\u2019s population behind climate change ahead of crucial United Nation talks scheduled to begin in November by teaming up with pop star Pharrell Williams. A 24-hour-long live music extravaganza is to be held in June \u2013 with concerts involving more than 100 as yet unannounced acts on seven continents \u2013 and it will be the second time the former US vice president has teamed up with the singer to raise awareness of climate change. Launching the Live Earth: Road to Paris concert in front of business leaders, politicians and policymakers assembled in the Swiss mountain tops, Gore said: \u201cThe purpose is to have a billion voices with one message to demand climate change now.\u201d \u201cIt is absolutely crucial that we build public will for an agreement,\u201d said Gore, who has won the Nobel peace price for his work on climate change. Much hinges on the UN-based talks in Paris, attendees at the Davos meeting were told. \u201cThere is a huge challenge ahead for the rest of this year,\u201d Kim told the Guardian. Kim noted there had been progress over the last 12 months, including the UN general assembly\u2019s commitment to set a carbon price, the agreement between the US and China on carbon emissions and the steps being made by big developing countries, such as India to invest in renewable energy. \u201cThe key is coming up with a vision of how we are going to finance mitigation and adaptation to climate change,\u201d said Kim, who runs an institution dedicated to eradicating poverty in the developing world. \u201cWe have got to get away from the mutual accusations between rich and poor and move towards cohesive collaboration. Things are different and if we can find ways of being creative, particularly on funding, we are more likely to find agreement. What we don\u2019t want is to get to a situation where developing countries are saying to the rich countries: \u2018where\u2019s that $100bn a year you promised us\u2019.\u201d The hopes for progress in Paris combined with the collapse in the oil price \u2013 at its lowest level since 2009 \u2013 were also seized upon by Lord Stern, a former advisor to previous UK governments on climate change. \u201cThis year will shape the next 20 ... it is the poor who are hit hardest by climate change,\u201d Stern said. He called on policymarkers to take enlightened action. \u201cIf you want to put a carbon tax on, now is absolutely the right moment,\u201d said Stern. Gore had started the first full day of events at the annual gathering in Davos by telling delegates: \u201cThis is the year of climate\u201d. Speaking against a backdrop of images intended to show the impact of climate change, Gore launched his plans amid criticism at the WEF of delegates arriving in private jets to attend the conference in 5,000 feet up in the Swiss Alps. The organisers of WEF urge delegates not to fly by private jet and use the train instead. Some attendees are transported in electric buggies. Gore, who has been leading calls for action on climate change, said: \u201cWe need to put a price on carbon and we need to put a price on denial in politics.\u201d Williams, who fronted a similar 24-hour Live Earth event in 2007, when Rihanna and Genesis were among the performers, said: \u201cWe are going to have humanity harmonise all at once.\u201d Gore said the 18 June event will take place on seven continents, including Antarctica where climate change scientists are based.

Bullish BHP BHP Billiton is one of those companies that likes to boast that it hasn\u2019t cut its dividend in simply ages, not since the Great Depression according to one version of the tale. This is not quite as striking as it sounds as today\u2019s company is a relatively modern creation. The Aussies at BHP got hitched with the South Africans at Billiton in 2001. But still: BHP was the big miner that didn\u2019t wilt in the last commodity crash in 2008-09. Rio Tinto and Xstrata went cap in hand to shareholders for cash to repair broken balance sheets. BHP not only avoided a rights issue but protected its dividend. Can it do it again? Yesterday\u2019s operational update offered, as expected, evidence that it damn well intends to try. US shale, a badly timed adventure, will receive a capital expenditure shakedown. The number of rigs will fall from 26 to 16 this year.

All BHP\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d products \u2013 iron ore, petroleum, copper and coal \u2013 have slumped in price over the past year and the first line of defence for a miner\u2019s dividend is lower capital expenditure. At current spot prices, Goldman Sachs\u2019s analyst reckons BHP needs to \u201cfind\u201d $12bn over the next three years to maintain, or perhaps increase, a dividend that currently costs about $6.4bn a year. It sounds a tall order, but not impossible. Goldman reckons lower spending could fill the bulk of the shortfall. It thinks BHP has the freedom to spend $10bn a year rather than $13bn to weather the storm. That would still leave the balance sheet to take some of the strain but that, in theory, is also doable. Credit rating agencies agree that BHP is conservatively funded. This semi-bullish portrait would clearly be ruined if commodity prices take another lurch downwards and stay at sunken levels for a while. But, if you believe the dividend is safe, the current yield is 5.6%. If you\u2019ve also got the stomach for the inevitable volatility in the share price (down by a third since last August), it is a reasonable long-term punt.

The Bank of England\u2019s governor was right. Inflation, on the CPI measure, is now 0.5% and the letter will soon be in the post. Now, we learn from this month\u2019s minutes of the meeting of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, it\u2019s a \u201croughly even chance\u201d that inflation will go below zero \u201cat some point in the first half of 2015\u201d.

    "webTitle": "Can the eurozone afford a Greek exit?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Eurozone officials have spent the last four years building a financial buffer big enough to cope with a Greek exit. Ever since 2010 when Athens found itself unable to refinance its foreign loans and asked for a \u20ac120bn bailout, Brussels has sought to prevent another collapse and repeat of the crisis that swamped all ideas of recovery. Today a Grexit would weaken German and French banks, and cost the German government up to \u20ac77bn and the International Monetary Fund a slug of its loans, but would be unlikely to frighten global markets or undermine the 14-year-old currency bloc. In the last few weeks eurozone government bonds, which reflect the stability of a country\u2019s finances, have remained steady while the leftist Syriza party\u2019s polling has jumped. In part, analysts say the \u20ac440bn European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) amassed by Brussels is a big enough buffer. They have also scrutinised Syriza\u2019s stance and reasoned that leader, Alex Tsipras, has given himself enough wriggle room to soften his previously hardline stance. Still, there are fears that the binding that holds the eurozone together will be loosened, especially if Greece is allowed to default while remaining inside the zone. The Bruegal Institute in Brussels is not the only thinktank to believe the estimated \u20ac250bn cost of a Grexit, while covered by the bailout funds, would cripple the eurozone and delay recovery for a decade. Zsolt Darvas, one of the institute\u2019s economists said: \u201cI am convinced that Greece will need new funding from European partners, but its volume should be a few dozen billion euros, say \u20ac20bn-\u20ac30bn. \u201cCompare the inconveniences of these additional funds to the losses on the existing approximate \u20ac250bn share of official lenders in Greek public debt (Greek Loan Facility, EFSF loans, International Monetary Fund loans, money owed to the European Central Bank and national central bank holdings of Greek bonds) and on various kinds of European Central Bank claims on Greece in the case of a Grexit.\u201d Darvas said Greek loans can be extended to help Athens delay payments and use the money for reconstruction. Joachim Poss, the German Social Democratic party\u2019s deputy finance spokesman in the German parliament, said earlier this month the total was unaffordable. \u201cEurope as a whole would pick up a very, very large bill and Germany the biggest part \u2013 let there be no mistake,\u201d he said, concluding: \u201cEurope can\u2019t afford a Greek exit.\u201d The Ifo Munich-based thinktank has chalked up losses to Germany of at least \u20ac77bn. President Hans-Werner Sinn, known for backing German business interests, said it was folly to be blackmailed by Tsipras and that it would be better to let Greece depart. He said the losses from a Grexit would be less than continued membership with endless loans and debt forgiveness, though his preference was for a debt conference that found a way to delay payments. Tsipras wants Athens to be forgiven some debts to cut the cost of repayments. This would allow Greece a partial default while staying inside the euro. Brussels has said this is naive politics, if only because Ireland and Portugal, which also have mountainous debts with the EU, would ask for the same. A default that involves leaving the eurozone could wipe out 100% of Athens\u2019 debts with EU governments, but still leave sizeable private sector debts without any access to funds other than taxes paid to the Greek exchequer. An end to austerity is the promise Syriza offers voters, either through debt forgiveness inside the euro or a debt free life outside. However, the ailing Greek economy, which is suffering from an unemployment level twice as high as it was in May 2010 and industrial production 30% below to its pre-crisis level, has few ways to generate income without the EU\u2019s support. A newly minted drachma would be low enough to attract holidaymakers, but without the investment in new hotels, the industry could barely cope. Likewise, investment in new industries would be unlikely unless Tsipras can honour his pledge to root out corruption, something that has eluded the right-wing New Democracy party. Maybe the IMF would offer its support, but like the EU\u2019s funds, the IMF\u2019s come with more austerity.",

      "body": "<p>Eurozone officials have spent the last four years building a financial buffer big enough to cope with a Greek exit. Ever since 2010 when Athens found itself unable to refinance its foreign loans and asked for a \u20ac120bn bailout, Brussels has sought to prevent another collapse and repeat of the crisis that swamped all ideas of recovery.</p> <p>Today a Grexit would weaken German and French banks, and cost the German government up to \u20ac77bn and the International Monetary Fund a slug of its loans, but would be unlikely to frighten global markets or undermine the 14-year-old currency bloc.</p> <p>In the last few weeks eurozone government bonds, which reflect the stability of a country\u2019s finances, have remained steady while the leftist Syriza party\u2019s polling has jumped.</p> <p>In part, analysts say the \u20ac440bn European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) amassed by Brussels is a big enough buffer. They have also scrutinised Syriza\u2019s stance and reasoned that leader, Alex Tsipras, has given himself <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/18/alexis-tsipras-syriza-markets-debt-reassure\" title=\"\">enough wriggle room</a> to soften his previously hardline stance.</p> <p>Still, there are fears that the binding that holds the eurozone together will be loosened, especially if Greece is allowed to default while remaining inside the zone.</p> <p>The Bruegal Institute in Brussels is not the only thinktank to believe <a href=\"http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1542-why-a-grexit-is-more-costly-for-germany-than-a-default-inside-the-euro-area/?utm_source=Bruegel+Updates&amp;utm_campaign=eee0f0430f-Bruegel+Update+for+Members&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_eb026b984a-eee0f0430f-278074121\" title=\"\">the estimated \u20ac250bn</a> cost of a Grexit, while covered by the bailout funds, would cripple the eurozone and delay recovery for a decade.</p> <p>Zsolt Darvas, one of the institute\u2019s economists said: \u201cI am convinced that Greece will need new funding from European partners, but its volume should be a few dozen billion euros, say \u20ac20bn-\u20ac30bn.</p> <p>\u201cCompare the inconveniences of these additional funds to the losses on the existing approximate \u20ac250bn share of official lenders in Greek public debt (Greek Loan Facility, EFSF loans, International Monetary Fund loans, money owed to the European Central Bank and national central bank holdings of Greek bonds) and on various kinds of European Central Bank claims on Greece in the case of a Grexit.\u201d</p> <p>Darvas said Greek loans can be extended <a href=\"http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1533-how-to-reduce-the-greek-debt-burden/\" title=\"\">to help Athens delay payments</a> and use the money for reconstruction.</p> <p>Joachim Poss, the German Social Democratic party\u2019s deputy finance spokesman in the German parliament, said <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-05/greek-exit-seen-as-too-costly-by-merkel-coalition-member.html\" title=\"\">earlier this month</a> the total was unaffordable. \u201cEurope as a whole would pick up a very, very large bill and Germany the biggest part \u2013 let there be no mistake,\u201d he said, concluding: \u201cEurope can\u2019t afford a Greek exit.\u201d</p> <p>The Ifo Munich-based thinktank has <a href=\"http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/presse/Pressemitteilungen/Pressemitteilungen-Archiv/2015/Q1/press_20150106_Griechenland.html\" title=\"\">chalked up losses to Germany</a> of at least \u20ac77bn. President Hans-Werner Sinn, known for backing German business interests, said it was folly to be blackmailed by Tsipras and that it would be better to let Greece depart. He said the losses from a Grexit would be less than continued membership with endless loans and debt forgiveness, though his preference was for a debt conference that found a way to delay payments.</p> <p>Tsipras wants Athens to be forgiven some debts to cut the cost of repayments. This would allow Greece a partial default while staying inside the euro. Brussels has said this is naive politics, if only because Ireland and Portugal, which also have mountainous debts with the EU, would ask for the same. A default that involves leaving the eurozone could wipe out 100% of Athens\u2019 debts with EU governments, but still leave sizeable private sector debts without any access to funds other than taxes paid to the Greek exchequer.</p> <p>An end to austerity is the promise Syriza offers voters, either through debt forgiveness inside the euro or a debt free life outside. However, the ailing Greek economy, which is suffering from an unemployment level twice as high as it was in May 2010 and industrial production 30% below to its pre-crisis level, has few ways to generate income without the EU\u2019s support.</p> <p>A newly minted drachma would be low enough to attract holidaymakers, but without the investment in new hotels, the industry could barely cope. Likewise, investment in new industries would be unlikely unless Tsipras can honour his pledge to root out corruption, something that has eluded the right-wing New Democracy party. Maybe the IMF would offer its support, but like the EU\u2019s funds, the IMF\u2019s come with more austerity.</p>",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s prospects of stoking the feelgood factor in the run-up to May\u2019s general election received a double boost on Wednesday, with news that living standards are rising and an interest rate rise is likely to be delayed until late 2015 at the earliest. Mark Carney, the Bank of England\u2019s governor, has repeatedly warned debt-burdened homeowners to brace themselves for higher borrowing costs as the economy continues to recover. But after plunging oil prices dragged inflation down to just 0.5%, the two policymakers on the Bank\u2019s nine-member rate-setting committee who had repeatedly called for a rise have changed their minds. It now looks almost certain that the coalition government will see out its entire term in office with interest rates unchanged at 0.5% \u2013 the lowest level in history. \u201cIt would certainly now be a huge surprise if the Bank of England raised interest rates before the final months of this year,\u201d said City analyst Howard Archer. Any delay will be a relief for consumers who are already struggling to make their mortgage repayments \u2014 though it will disappoint savers eking out meagre returns. \u201cIn our view, the first hike could be as far away as 2017,\u201d said economists at the City consultancy Fathom. According to minutes of its January meeting (pdf), the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee now expects inflation to dip to zero in March, while average wages are increasing at their fastest pace for two years. Official figures published separately showed that with unemployment falling, average pay increased by 1.8% in the year to November, up from 1.6% in October. With pay growth now outpacing inflation, and expected to continue to do so over the coming months, Labour may face a tougher challenge in making the argument that Britain is locked in a \u201ccost of living crisis\u201d. Unemployment has continued to decline, falling by 58,000 in the three months to November, according to the office for national statistics. The unemployment rate has dropped to 5.8%, its lowest level for six years, though the pace of improvement in the labour market has slowed. Chris Williamson, of research group Markit, said: \u201cThe data bode well for a revival of consumer spending and household wellbeing in coming months: increasing numbers of people are in paid employment and wage growth is outstripping inflation, meaning incomes are rising, and falling oil prices mean that more of these incomes can be saved or spent on goods and services other than fuel.\u201d The chancellor seized on the news as evidence that his economic policies are working. Osborne said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures confirm what the IMF said yesterday: despite growing risks in the global economy, Britain is pulling ahead with record numbers in work, falling unemployment and wages rising significantly faster than inflation. \u201cIf we want to carry on making progress towards our goal of full employment then we must continue to work through our long term economic plan \u2013 that\u2019s the only way to deliver economic security in an uncertain world economy.\u201d However, the shadow work and pensions secretary, Rachel Reeves, said: \u201cToday\u2019s fall in overall unemployment is welcome, but wages remain sluggish and working people are \u00a31,600 a year worse off since 2010.\u201d Unemployment also continued to fall on the narrower, claimant count index, which measures the number of people receiving out-of-work benefits. The claimant count was 823,900 in December, down 24,200 on the month. That figure compares to a fall of almost 40,000 in November. Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, the two MPC hawks, who had advocated higher interest rates since last August, conceded that hiking borrowing costs now would increase the risk of deflation \u2014 a damaging decline in prices. John Philpott, of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said an increasing number of vacancies was helping to drive up wages, as employers have to pay more to attract staff. \u201cThe most encouraging news in the latest quarterly figures is a rise of 19,000 in the number of job vacancies to a new record level of 700,000. This indicates a modest ongoing tightening of conditions in the labour market which underpins a continued increase in pay growth and a further improvement in real weekly earnings.\u201d However, youth unemployment actually rose, with the number of 16 \u2013 24 year olds out of work increasing by 10,000, raising concerns that young people may not be benefiting from job creation as the economy picks up.",

      "body": "<p>Poundland took market share from across the retail sector over Christmas, according to its chief executive Jim McCarthy, despite revealing slightly disappointing sales figures.</p> <p>Shares in the budget chain, which floated on the stock exchange last year, fell 3.7% after he admitted a slower than hoped increase in new stores and a slowdown in growth at established outlets had held the chain back in the three months to 28 December.</p> <p>A tie-up with Jane Asher on bakeware and baking ingredients helped sales rise 10.2%, excluding currency fluctuations. But analysts at Shore Capital estimated delays in opening a handful of stores had lowered the pace of growth by about 1.5 percentage points.</p> <p>Analyst Clive Black said: \u201cWhile this is an undoubted disappointment for management and investors alike, this is a short-term phenomenon that should bode well for full-year 2016 growth.\u201d The broker added that underlying sales, which exclude the impact of new store openings, rose by between 1% and 2% over the quarter compared to as much as 4% in the previous quarter.</p> <p>McCarthy said Poundland was set to open 19 stores in the next quarter so would meet its target for the year, and he was confident the chain would continue to see sales growth. \u201cWe would have liked sales to have been a little bit better, and it would have been if new store openings had been delivered,\u201d McCarthy said.</p> <p>Sales of make-up, baking equipment, novelty pet accessories and Christmas confectionery helped drive growth.

      "bodyText": "Poundland took market share from across the retail sector over Christmas, according to its chief executive Jim McCarthy, despite revealing slightly disappointing sales figures. Shares in the budget chain, which floated on the stock exchange last year, fell 3.7% after he admitted a slower than hoped increase in new stores and a slowdown in growth at established outlets had held the chain back in the three months to 28 December. A tie-up with Jane Asher on bakeware and baking ingredients helped sales rise 10.2%, excluding currency fluctuations. But analysts at Shore Capital estimated delays in opening a handful of stores had lowered the pace of growth by about 1.5 percentage points. Analyst Clive Black said: \u201cWhile this is an undoubted disappointment for management and investors alike, this is a short-term phenomenon that should bode well for full-year 2016 growth.\u201d The broker added that underlying sales, which exclude the impact of new store openings, rose by between 1% and 2% over the quarter compared to as much as 4% in the previous quarter. McCarthy said Poundland was set to open 19 stores in the next quarter so would meet its target for the year, and he was confident the chain would continue to see sales growth. \u201cWe would have liked sales to have been a little bit better, and it would have been if new store openings had been delivered,\u201d McCarthy said. Sales of make-up, baking equipment, novelty pet accessories and Christmas confectionery helped drive growth. McCarthy said the success of the tie-up with Asher had prompted it to team up with former Ground Force presenter Tommy Walsh for a range of DIY goods. McCarthy admitted Poundland had endured a \u201cslow day\u201d on Black Friday, the late November promotional sales day imported from the US, as the majority of shoppers looked for their bargains online.

In 2007 Nicholas Negroponte launched his \u201cone laptop per child campaign\u201d aiming to bring cheap computers to children in developing countries. But is is more likely than not these encounters would have happened without the bracing mountain air of Davos. Bill Gates and Nelson Mandela added stardust to Davos, rather than the other way around. The main charge against Davos is that it is little more than a talking shop, where elites enjoy consensus over fondue. A more serious criticism is that Davos breeds groupthink. In the mid 2000s, Davos-goers ignored warnings about the riskiness of global finance. Anti-poverty campaigners argue that today\u2019s consensus is that the poor are getting richer, despite the fact that the number of people living in poverty in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 on less than $2 a day \u2013 has doubled to 562 million since 1981.",

The question is no longer \u201cAre we done\u201d? but \u201cWhat more must we do?\u201d</p> <p>Obama\u2019s plan is a redistributive one, designed to close some tax breaks for the wealthy and put $325bn in savings into the hands of the middle class. <br></p> <p>One notable aspect of Obama\u2019s plan is that financial institutions with assets of over $50bn would have to pay a 0.07% fee, a kind of tax for being too big to fail. The fee would raise roughly $110bn over the next 10 years from around 100 firms. <br></p> <p>But the key to the plan is that it does not tax the bank\u2019s assets, or what they own; it taxes their liabilities, or what they owe. <br></p> <p>In other words, it\u2019s a tax on bank borrowing, which punishes one of the key drivers of the 2008 financial crisis.

Leverage means taking on debt. It\u2019s borrowing to increase the value of your assets. When you take a mortgage, you\u2019re leveraging your down payment to borrow enough money for a home. When a private equity firm like Blackstone Group acquires SeaWorld, it is taking a little cash and borrowing against the value of the company. That\u2019s leverage. <br></p> <p>Banks thrive on leverage. Their businesses are based on debt: on lending and borrowing. <br></p> <p>Banks sustain themselves, day to day, mostly by borrowing from others: the Federal Reserve, other banks, customer deposits. The more they borrow, the more profits they can make. As long as the banks pay less to borrow than the potential income they can earn from their assets, they can magnify their profits. That is what is known as leverage.</p> <p>Leverage can also be dangerous. While it increases profits, it also increases the risk of insolvency. The higher borrowing goes, the more valuable their assets have to be to keep pace. High leverage accelerated the financial crisis, because banks had borrowed so much money that they could not absorb losses from the collapse of the housing bubble.</p> <p>As the White House fact sheet says, \u201cThe President\u2019s proposal would attach a cost to leverage for the largest financial firms, leading them to make decisions more consistent with the economy-wide effects of their actions, which would in turn help reduce the probability of major defaults that can have widespread economic costs.\u201d</p> <p>Dodd-Frank basically skipped the question of decreasing leverage, opting to allow an international process called Basel III to set standards. <br></p> <p>But the Federal Reserve has been gradually instituting leverage requirements for the largest financial institutions. The Fed\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20140408a.htm\">first leverage ratio</a>, implemented last April, doubled the Basel III benchmark. <br></p> <p>Then, in December, they announced a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-proposes-extra-capital-requirement-for-8-biggest-u-s-banks-1418154076\">capital surcharge</a>\u201d for the eight largest banks. The Fed believes that lower leverage eliminates the need for bailouts, as banks can pay for their own mistakes.</p> <p>Of course, the biggest problem for this proposal is it\u2019s not going to pass. Republicans have already labeled it <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/republicans-obama-sotu-tax-proposal\">dead on arrival</a>, and they have in the past <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2010/06/29/173361/conference-committee-reopens/\">gone to great lengths</a> to shield banks from new taxes.</p> <p>This may look like a Democratic or progressive dream, but some Republicans have also supported reducing leverage for banks. <br></p> <p>Senator David Vitter has been a champion <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/in-brown-vitter-bill-a-banking-overhaul-with-possible-teeth/\">for much lower leverage</a>; the current Senate banking committee chairman, Richard Shelby, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/06/senate-votes-for-wall-str_n_567063.html\">voted to put size caps</a> on the largest banks.

The bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We upgrade Arm from neutral to buy with a target price of 1200p. The upgrade is based on three premises \u2013 1) a favorable outlook for valuation based upon improving earnings momentum, slowing pace of derating and qualitative bias, 2) increased conviction in the firm\u2019s ability to compete and maintain its dominant share in mobile, and 3) free cash flow and balance sheet optionality.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall, with a number of positive trading updates, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 107.94 points or 1.63% higher at 6728.04. But European shares, although they ended higher, underperformed the UK index following reports that the European Central Bank will unveil quantitative easing of \u20ac50bn a month for at least a year on Thursday, less than some had been hoping for. Investors were also increasingly concerned about the outcome of this weekend\u2019s Greek election as anti-austerity party Syriza moves further ahead in the polls.<br></p> <p>Back in the UK, publishing group <strong>Pearson</strong> - joint owner of Penguin Random House - put on 60p to \u00a312.96 after a better than expected performance. It gave a higher than predicted forecast for 2014 earnings and said it expected to return to growth in 2015 after a couple of problematic years, helped by a good performance from its North American business.</p> <p><strong>SABMiller</strong> added 99p to \u00a334.42 after the brewer unveiled a 4% rise in third quarter revenue despite weakness in China.</p> <p>With oil edging higher - Brent crude is up 1.4% at $48.67 a barrel - energy companies are also helping to support the market. <strong>BG</strong> is 36.6p better at 885.9p and <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> B shares have risen 51p to \u00a322.27.</p> <p>But <strong>Sports Direct International</strong> dropped 44p to 716.5p following confirmation that founder Mike Ashley had sold \u00a3110m worth of shares at 720p each. There was much talk some of the cash was destined for Rangers football club.</p> <p>But Barclays looked at the implications for <strong>Debenhams</strong>, up 0.45p at 72.55p, where Ashley has sold put options. Barclays said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It may be coincidental but simple arithmetic suggests that the sale of these Sports Direct shares potentially equates to around 13.2% of the current market cap of Debenhams (as of Tuesday\u2019s closing share price). As a reminder Sports Direct has a 12.7% exposure to Debenhams shares that exists through Debenham put options that Sports Direct has sold. A large proportion of these options expires between January and March this year, although the strike price is unknown. The sale of the put options by Sports Direct happened twice in the recent past when Debenham shares were trading at around 80p and around 63p respectively.</p> <p>If the size of the Sports Direct share sale and the Debenhams exposure are coincidentally similar sizes then there is no fundamental news, but if the counterpart owning the put option wanted to exercise the option, then Sports Direct, potentially through Mike Ashley, would now have the money to buy the associated Debenham shares. Mike Ashley has a track record of owning stakes in other retailers.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares raced to a near seven week high, with Arm among the main risers. The chip designer added 31p to \u00a310.59 ahead of its full year results early next month after an upgrade from Citigroup. The bank said: We upgrade Arm from neutral to buy with a target price of 1200p. The upgrade is based on three premises \u2013 1) a favorable outlook for valuation based upon improving earnings momentum, slowing pace of derating and qualitative bias, 2) increased conviction in the firm\u2019s ability to compete and maintain its dominant share in mobile, and 3) free cash flow and balance sheet optionality. Overall, with a number of positive trading updates, the FTSE 100 finished 107.94 points or 1.63% higher at 6728.04. But European shares, although they ended higher, underperformed the UK index following reports that the European Central Bank will unveil quantitative easing of \u20ac50bn a month for at least a year on Thursday, less than some had been hoping for. Investors were also increasingly concerned about the outcome of this weekend\u2019s Greek election as anti-austerity party Syriza moves further ahead in the polls. Back in the UK, publishing group Pearson - joint owner of Penguin Random House - put on 60p to \u00a312.96 after a better than expected performance. It gave a higher than predicted forecast for 2014 earnings and said it expected to return to growth in 2015 after a couple of problematic years, helped by a good performance from its North American business. SABMiller added 99p to \u00a334.42 after the brewer unveiled a 4% rise in third quarter revenue despite weakness in China. With oil edging higher - Brent crude is up 1.4% at $48.67 a barrel - energy companies are also helping to support the market. BG is 36.6p better at 885.9p and Royal Dutch Shell B shares have risen 51p to \u00a322.27. But Sports Direct International dropped 44p to 716.5p following confirmation that founder Mike Ashley had sold \u00a3110m worth of shares at 720p each. There was much talk some of the cash was destined for Rangers football club. But Barclays looked at the implications for Debenhams, up 0.45p at 72.55p, where Ashley has sold put options. Barclays said: It may be coincidental but simple arithmetic suggests that the sale of these Sports Direct shares potentially equates to around 13.2% of the current market cap of Debenhams (as of Tuesday\u2019s closing share price). As a reminder Sports Direct has a 12.7% exposure to Debenhams shares that exists through Debenham put options that Sports Direct has sold. A large proportion of these options expires between January and March this year, although the strike price is unknown. The sale of the put options by Sports Direct happened twice in the recent past when Debenham shares were trading at around 80p and around 63p respectively. If the size of the Sports Direct share sale and the Debenhams exposure are coincidentally similar sizes then there is no fundamental news, but if the counterpart owning the put option wanted to exercise the option, then Sports Direct, potentially through Mike Ashley, would now have the money to buy the associated Debenham shares. Mike Ashley has a track record of owning stakes in other retailers. He owns stakes at Tesco, House of Fraser and MySale. Elsewhere Intertek fell 88p to \u00a322.97 after a downbeat trading update from product testing equipment peer SGS. BT added 6.9p to 421.3p after a German magazine reported the telecoms group\u2019s due diligence talks about the purchase of EE were going well, with no surprises so far.

It said: We have upgraded our share price targets and stock ratings to reflect our expectation that the ECB will launch QE in the eurozone on Thursday and to reflect our rolling out of share price targets by one year. We expect eurozone QE to benefit the quoted property sector through boosting economic growth through a depreciation in the euro and to stimulate property investment across Europe through increasing the amount of liquidity in the financial system and tempting non-eurozone buyers to acquire properties that have become cheaper in their own currencies.

At the end of the fourth quarter, deposits from business customers were 64% of total deposits, and lending to businesses made up 45% of total lending. Craig Donaldson, chief executive of Metro Bank, said: \u201c2014 was another great year for Metro Bank. Throughout the year we saw substantial growth in deposits and lending, and the number of personal and business customers joining the banking revolution has continued to increase. As we start a new year, we\u2019re excited to continue innovating and providing a real banking choice to the British people, as well as maintaining our commitment to deliver the best in service and convenience.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s all very familiar. Oil prices are plunging. The US is the locomotive for global growth. The dollar is strong. Close your eyes and you could imagine the clock had been turned back almost 30 years to the mid-1980s, when the Reagan-Thatcher double act was in its pomp. Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, says there is definitely a sense of back to the future as the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum convenes in Davos, Switzerland. Then as now, the world was recovering from a deep slump. Then as now, the cost of crude was coming down from a level that had caused severe problems for oil-importing nations. Behravesh notes that the upshot of the collapse in the cost of crude in the mid-1980s was a powerful three-year boom and estimates that in 2015 the fall in oil prices from $115 (\u00a376) to $50 a barrel will provide a $1.5tn boost to the global economy. Even so, there is no real sense in Davos that another boom is in the offing. Six years after the recession of 2008-09, the mood remains uncertain. A survey of chief executives from PricewaterhouseCoopers found that optimism has dipped a bit over the past year. The International Monetary Fund has just shaved its forecasts for global growth, noting that things would be even worse were it not for cheaper oil. There are worries about Ukraine, Greece and terrorism in all its guises, including cyberterrorism. Not even the most optimistic voices in Davos believe the world is on the cusp of a late 1980s-style boom. There are a number of reasons for that. Firstly, the crisis of 2008-09 was different from that of the early 1980s. It was deeper, broader and struck right at the heart of the global financial system. In the mid-1980s, the banks were raring to lend money. Today they are a lot more cautious. Secondly, the caution shown by the private banks has put a lot more pressure on central banks to keep economies ticking over. Global growth averaged 5% in the four years leading up to the crisis: the IMF is predicting 3.5% for this year and 3.7% for 2016. But this \u201cnew normal\u201d has only been possible thanks to colossal amounts of stimulus. Thirdly, the eurozone economy is in much worse shape than it was in the 1980s. A perennial subject at Davos is whether the eurozone can finally resolve its problems. Everybody at the forum expects Mario Draghi to announce that the European Central Bank is going to start buying sovereign bonds in a bid to prevent the eurozone becoming mired in deflation. Few expect the ECB president to fire a magic bullet. Finally, there\u2019s the distribution of the spoils. In the mid-1980s, despite the union curbs from Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, workers could still expect to see their real incomes rise. Year after year, wages rose faster than prices and living standards increased. That pattern was broken in the recession of 2008-09. Hence the anger of the unions gathered in Davos. Hence the focus on inequality. Hence the sense that even now, when memories of the last crash would normally be fading fast, the recovery job on the world economy is far from complete.",

      "body": "<p>Clutching a lunchtime orange juice and sandwich in Zurich\u2019s central station, nurse Nelly Studer captured the fears gnawing at Switzerland since the drama in the foreign exchange markets last Thursday when the Swiss franc jumped 30% in value against the euro.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that our exporters are not going to move jobs abroad. We need to keep jobs in Switzerland, and I hope they do not cut salaries either,\u201d Studer said.</p> <p>\u201cI think that companies who rely on exports will have to find solutions. It will be very hard for them, very difficult.\u201d</p> <p>The Swiss central bank\u2019s decision to abandon its cap against the euro made its chairman, Thomas Jordan, an unpopular man in the foreign exchange markets. But there was little outward sign that Swiss citizens were angry with Jordan on the road to Davos on Tuesday.</p> <p>Despite Studer\u2019s worries, she still welcomed the move to remove the \u201cartificial\u201d cap on the value of the franc.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t fear for her own career, as the health centre where she works is short of staff, she said. But she frets that exporters suffer, if their goods are too expensive in foreign markets.</p> <p>On the train out of Zurich\u2019s main station, a mechanic who worked for a international company and preferred not to give his name, admitted: \u201cIt\u2019s not good for exporters.\u201d</p> <p>The cap had been in place in September 2011, as Swiss policymakers tried to prevent their currency becoming too strong. Its popularity as a safe haven rose steadily amid the eurozone storm. The Russian crisis last year had exacerbated the inflows into Switzerland and left the country with a battle on its hands to stop its currency strengthening through 1.20 against the euro.</p> <p>After Jordan\u2019s move \u2013 which caught out many FX traders, forcing several brokers to collapse \u2013 the currency experienced one of the biggest one-day surges in history.</p> <p>Swiss nationals were surprised too. \u201cWe started January thinking that the cap would go on and on, and then boom, it was gone,\u201d Struder said. But that\u2019s not a reason to criticise the SNB chairman. \u201cI have confidence in his abilities \u2026 removing the ceiling against the euro was the right thing to do\u201d.</p> <p>Jordan, like many central bank chiefs, is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos this week where his action is likely to be the subject of much debate. Economists fear a stronger franc will hurt economic growth and raise the risk of deflation.</p> <p>Carl M\u00fcller, a pensioner travelling from Zurich with his wife, also retains his faith in Jordan.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been too much panicking. We need to wait and see how the situation stabilises,\u201d he explained, as his carriage wound around the tranquil shore of Lake Z\u00fcrich.</p> <p>Critics of the central bank are unhappy that it abandoned the cap without warning, having recently pledged to maintain it.

      "bodyText": "Clutching a lunchtime orange juice and sandwich in Zurich\u2019s central station, nurse Nelly Studer captured the fears gnawing at Switzerland since the drama in the foreign exchange markets last Thursday when the Swiss franc jumped 30% in value against the euro. \u201cI hope that our exporters are not going to move jobs abroad. We need to keep jobs in Switzerland, and I hope they do not cut salaries either,\u201d Studer said. \u201cI think that companies who rely on exports will have to find solutions. It will be very hard for them, very difficult.\u201d The Swiss central bank\u2019s decision to abandon its cap against the euro made its chairman, Thomas Jordan, an unpopular man in the foreign exchange markets. But there was little outward sign that Swiss citizens were angry with Jordan on the road to Davos on Tuesday. Despite Studer\u2019s worries, she still welcomed the move to remove the \u201cartificial\u201d cap on the value of the franc. She didn\u2019t fear for her own career, as the health centre where she works is short of staff, she said. But she frets that exporters suffer, if their goods are too expensive in foreign markets. On the train out of Zurich\u2019s main station, a mechanic who worked for a international company and preferred not to give his name, admitted: \u201cIt\u2019s not good for exporters.\u201d The cap had been in place in September 2011, as Swiss policymakers tried to prevent their currency becoming too strong. Its popularity as a safe haven rose steadily amid the eurozone storm. The Russian crisis last year had exacerbated the inflows into Switzerland and left the country with a battle on its hands to stop its currency strengthening through 1.20 against the euro. After Jordan\u2019s move \u2013 which caught out many FX traders, forcing several brokers to collapse \u2013 the currency experienced one of the biggest one-day surges in history. Swiss nationals were surprised too. \u201cWe started January thinking that the cap would go on and on, and then boom, it was gone,\u201d Struder said. But that\u2019s not a reason to criticise the SNB chairman. \u201cI have confidence in his abilities \u2026 removing the ceiling against the euro was the right thing to do\u201d. Jordan, like many central bank chiefs, is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos this week where his action is likely to be the subject of much debate. Economists fear a stronger franc will hurt economic growth and raise the risk of deflation. Carl M\u00fcller, a pensioner travelling from Zurich with his wife, also retains his faith in Jordan. \u201cThere has been too much panicking. We need to wait and see how the situation stabilises,\u201d he explained, as his carriage wound around the tranquil shore of Lake Z\u00fcrich. Critics of the central bank are unhappy that it abandoned the cap without warning, having recently pledged to maintain it. But there was little sympathy for such complaints among the passengers of the express to Chur. \u201cThey had to act immediately, or speculators would have profited,\u201d pointed out Frau M\u00fcller. Instead Jordan ended up causing pain for many in the markets who had expected the peg would stay in place. As delegates began to register for the annual meeting in Davos \u2013 where 2,500 business executives, world leaders and policymakers try to put the world\u2019s problems to rights \u2013 hoteliers and shopkeepers were more reluctant to offer a view. Attendees have avoided the worst of the currency move as hoteliers demand payment in advance. But tourists with skiing on their minds might baulk at paying more than 700 francs for the cheapest set of skis. Switzerland was already one of the world\u2019s most expensive countries. A small cup of coffee on that train out of Zurich would set you back SFr4.30, or a hefty \u00a33.20 at today\u2019s exchange rate. M\u00fcller predicts tougher times for Switzerland\u2019s tourist industry. They cannot simply expect eurozone visitors to swallow a 20% increase in bills when visiting the country. \u201cWe are quite pricey already,\u201d he points out.",

      "bodyText": "Trade union leaders have called for a new Magna Carta to tackle inequality and unemployment as they marked the start of the World Economic Forum with an urgent call for businesses to prevent social unrest by sharing the fruits of growth with employees. On the first full day of the WEF\u2019s annual meeting in Davos, leading labour voices said the 800th anniversary of King John\u2019s concessions in 1215 should be marked by a new charter of rights for workers. Philip Jennings, general secretary of UNI Global Union, which has 20 million members, said: \u201cPoliticians and business leaders at Davos are sitting on a volcano of legitimate discontent fuelled by unemployment, inequality and austerity. Collectively we have a responsibility to face up to the need to change course. \u201c\u2018Keeping Calm and Carrying On\u2019 is no answer to the urgency and anxiety of the times. The labour movement has constructive solutions to offer: A future built on a living wage, decent jobs and collective bargaining where workers have a seat at the table.\u201d Jennings was backed by Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC\u2019s general secretary, as he warned that the world was being transformed by the \u201cinsatiable greed\u201d of the richest 1%. An Oxfam report this week said by 2016, the 1% best-off people in the world would own more wealth than the other 99%. Noting that there had been an upsurge of unrest across the globe as people took to the streets to demonstrate against inequality and attacks on democracy, Jennings said: \u201c They are right to protest. \u201cThis year at Davos we will celebrate the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta, a cornerstone of modern democracy. \u201cWe should not forget that democracy has been hard-won and we should not let it leak away by continuing down the path of inequality for the benefit of a handful of multibillionaires. We need a new \u2018Including You\u2019 Magna Carta to address the urgency of our times. A Magna Carta for equality, jobs and sustainable growth. \u2018We the People\u2019 have spoken and Davos must listen and act.\u201d Trade unions have played an increasingly influential role at Davos in recent years, as concerns have grown over stagnating living standards and the growing divide between rich and poor. Policymakers, including Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, and Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, have stressed that inequality will damage growth if left unchecked. New research from the International Trade Unions Confederation shows that in a poll of 14 countries, only 50% of those questioned thought the next generation would find a decent job, 78% thought the economic system was biased in favour of the wealthy, and 62% wanted corporate power to be tamed. Sharan Burrow, the ITUC\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cToday\u2019s business model is bad for people, bad for the economy and bad for stability and democracy.\u201d O\u2019Grady said: \u201cJust 1% of the global population owns half the world\u2019s wealth, so we need some voices at Davos to speak up for the other 99%. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here as part of a delegation of international trade union leaders. If Davos is a closed shop for the wealthy and powerful elites who caused today\u2019s global inequality, it won\u2019t come up with the answers needed for a more fair and prosperous future for all the world\u2019s workers and their families. \u201cWe need to get living wages and the protection of public services onto the agenda. And we need the business leaders attending to commit to cleaning up supply chains, paying their taxes and investing in decent jobs instead of the casino capitalism that caused the crash.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Trans Pacific Partnership is a trade agreement so significant and important, its details can\u2019t be disclosed.</p> <p>The TPP, sure to make an appearance during tonight\u2019s State of the Union, is<a href=\"http://computer fraud and abuse\"> a 21st-century trade agreement</a> involving 11 Asian countries along the Pacific Rim, and said to cover 40% of the world\u2019s economy. </p> <p>The TPP is a subject close to the heart \u2013 and the economic plans \u2013 of President Obama. In a <a href=\"http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2014/November/Remarks-by-the-President-Before-TPP-Meeting\">November trip to Beijing, he urged other world leaders to finalize the agreement</a>, calling it a \u201chigh priority\u201d that would strengthen American leadership in the Asia-Pacific region and lead to growth, investment and job prospects for more workers. <br></p> <p>The administration has argued that the deal will allow lower tariffs for American exports, in an environment of increasing competition, especially from China. Obama is also touting the deal as a boon for small businesses. When 98% of the US\u2019s exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships will help them create even more jobs, he proclaimed in last year\u2019s State of the Union address. \u201cListen, China and Europe are not standing on the sidelines. Neither should we.\u201d</p> <p>Right now, American citizens will have to take those promises about the impact of the TPP on faith. </p> <p>The TPP is one of the largest international trade agreements the US will sign, yet most of it is mired in secrecy. Congress won\u2019t have access to the TPP before it is signed, and the terms won\u2019t be publicly disclosed \u2013 ironic since the negotiations include 600 corporate advisers, including representatives of Halliburton and Caterpillar. </p> <p>A chunk of the trade deal was leaked most recently by a Wikileaks release. \u201cEverything we know about it are from document leaks,\u201d says Maira Sutton, a policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. <br></p> <p>That sets light to the anger of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has called the TPP \u201cdisastrous\u201d and \u201cwritten behind closed doors by the corporate world\u201d. He denounced its purpose \u201cto protect the interests of the largest multinational corporations at the expense of workers, consumers, the environment and the foundations of American democracy.\u201d <br></p> <p>It\u2019s not just Sanders, who is among the most progressive in Congress. Democrats <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-says-he-willing-to-defy-democrats-on-his-support-of-trans-pacific-partnership/2014/12/03/25edcaf4-7b30-11e4-84d4-7c896b90abdc_story.html\">have long expressed</a> their opposition to the deal, even though 14 unions and consumer groups and environmental groups are also involved in the negotiations. <br></p> <p>No matter: the president says he is ready to defy his fellow Democrats to push through the TPP. In a case of odd bedfellows, Obama has found new Republican allies in pursuing the deal.</p> <p>US trade representative Michael Froman <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/13/us-usa-congress-trade-tpp-idUSKBN0KM25I20150113\">promised</a> that the Trans Pacific Partnership was on course and due in as little as two months. <br></p> <p>Obama\u2019s State of the Union address should give the TPP another push \u2013 even as public interest groups, trade experts and digital freedom advocates voice their criticism of the agreement, particularly its secrecy.<br></p> <h2>\u2018Don\u2019t fight the last war\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba579bf05dd9b17fd213aa790e92ba5254f47ca3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/17/1421525172337/d2bc45bb-bd01-4ccc-abb0-27a8c91e1091-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Obama\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US vice-president, Joe Biden, and House speaker John Boehner of Ohio listen as President Barack Obama gives his State of the Union address on Capitol Hill in Washington, claiming that the TPP will lead to more small business job creation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Dharapak/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What makes the TPP distasteful to experts is its resemblance to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), signed in 1994 between the US, Canada and Mexico. </p> <p>Post-Nafta, the US saw a mass exodus of jobs, with nearly 700,000 jobs offshored, <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/nafta-legacy-growing-us-trade-deficits-cost-682900-jobs/\">60.8% of them in manufacturing</a>. <br></p> <p>Now as the Obama administration uses the same verbiage as the Clinton administration used two decades ago, trade experts are alarmed at what is to come. The incentives of the Trans Pacific Partnership are going to cause millions of additional jobs to be lost, says Lori Wallach, the director of Global Trade Watch. <br></p> <p>Wallach quotes the Department of Labor statistics to show that the workers in the US who lose their jobs to trade agreements in the manufacturing sector when re-employed earn only three-quarters of their original earnings, in three out of five cases.</p> <p>\u201cThe opposition to the trade agreement comprises unions, environmental, consumer groups \u2013 in other words, the entire Democratic base,\u201d says Wallach. <br></p> <p>Wallach says that the agreement is based on the terms of the US-Korea free-trade agreement, which were derived from Nafta. The complications include limits on food safety and a ban on the export of gas derived from fracking \u2013 which \u201cwould limit our ability to have energy policies to combat the climate crisis\u201d, Wallach says. </p> <p>Another complication: the terms of the TPP won\u2019t be open to debate. A fast-track treatment is likely, with Congress implementing the deal without changes. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe president wants the authority to railroad through Congress to sign the agreement even before Congress,\u201d explains Wallach, saying it delegates congressional authority to the president.</p> <p>Yet Obama insists that the TPP\u2019s terms are new and improved. The president\u2019s only advice to critics: \u201cDon\u2019t fight the last war.\u201d</p> <h2><p>\u2018It copies and pastes US law into international law\u2019</p></h2> <p>The Trans Pacific Partnership, although billed as a trade agreement, includes provisions on intellectual property and copyright that are usually outside the boundaries of trade, critics say. </p> <p>For instance, there is a scuffle around the TPP\u2019s rumored treatment of Digital Rights Management tools, which corporations use to limit access to digital devices \u2013 often to prevent piracy. </p> <p>TPP has provisions that make it a crime to break these locks, and to do things that aren\u2019t even copyright infringement. </p> <p>\u201cThese DRM laws prevent us from doing that research legally,\u201d says Maira Sutton, a policy analyst at Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cThat\u2019s our main concern.\u201d</p> <p>Sutton objects that the TPP will extend problematic US laws into international law. One example: the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/11/aaron-swartz-icon-open-web-surveillance-nsa\">prosecutors used to hound open-web advocate Aaron Swartz</a>. </p> <p>\u201cSimilar provisions in the TPP that will prevent whistleblowers and journalists from accessing or \u2018disclosing\u2019 trade secrets through a computer system,\u201d Sutton says. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e2c182dc67cb06a6fbac54c9940faf6eca3517e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/17/1421525278464/9a41292b-ce9e-4b6b-b6ae-845213bee38f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"aaron swartz\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Information access advocate Aaron Swartz speaks to a crowd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel J.

      "bodyText": "The Trans Pacific Partnership is a trade agreement so significant and important, its details can\u2019t be disclosed. The TPP, sure to make an appearance during tonight\u2019s State of the Union, is a 21st-century trade agreement involving 11 Asian countries along the Pacific Rim, and said to cover 40% of the world\u2019s economy. The TPP is a subject close to the heart \u2013 and the economic plans \u2013 of President Obama. In a November trip to Beijing, he urged other world leaders to finalize the agreement, calling it a \u201chigh priority\u201d that would strengthen American leadership in the Asia-Pacific region and lead to growth, investment and job prospects for more workers. The administration has argued that the deal will allow lower tariffs for American exports, in an environment of increasing competition, especially from China. Obama is also touting the deal as a boon for small businesses. When 98% of the US\u2019s exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships will help them create even more jobs, he proclaimed in last year\u2019s State of the Union address. \u201cListen, China and Europe are not standing on the sidelines. Neither should we.\u201d Right now, American citizens will have to take those promises about the impact of the TPP on faith. The TPP is one of the largest international trade agreements the US will sign, yet most of it is mired in secrecy. Congress won\u2019t have access to the TPP before it is signed, and the terms won\u2019t be publicly disclosed \u2013 ironic since the negotiations include 600 corporate advisers, including representatives of Halliburton and Caterpillar. A chunk of the trade deal was leaked most recently by a Wikileaks release. \u201cEverything we know about it are from document leaks,\u201d says Maira Sutton, a policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. That sets light to the anger of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has called the TPP \u201cdisastrous\u201d and \u201cwritten behind closed doors by the corporate world\u201d. He denounced its purpose \u201cto protect the interests of the largest multinational corporations at the expense of workers, consumers, the environment and the foundations of American democracy.\u201d It\u2019s not just Sanders, who is among the most progressive in Congress. Democrats have long expressed their opposition to the deal, even though 14 unions and consumer groups and environmental groups are also involved in the negotiations. No matter: the president says he is ready to defy his fellow Democrats to push through the TPP. In a case of odd bedfellows, Obama has found new Republican allies in pursuing the deal. US trade representative Michael Froman promised that the Trans Pacific Partnership was on course and due in as little as two months. Obama\u2019s State of the Union address should give the TPP another push \u2013 even as public interest groups, trade experts and digital freedom advocates voice their criticism of the agreement, particularly its secrecy. \u2018Don\u2019t fight the last war\u2019 What makes the TPP distasteful to experts is its resemblance to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), signed in 1994 between the US, Canada and Mexico. Post-Nafta, the US saw a mass exodus of jobs, with nearly 700,000 jobs offshored, 60.8% of them in manufacturing. Now as the Obama administration uses the same verbiage as the Clinton administration used two decades ago, trade experts are alarmed at what is to come. The incentives of the Trans Pacific Partnership are going to cause millions of additional jobs to be lost, says Lori Wallach, the director of Global Trade Watch. Wallach quotes the Department of Labor statistics to show that the workers in the US who lose their jobs to trade agreements in the manufacturing sector when re-employed earn only three-quarters of their original earnings, in three out of five cases. \u201cThe opposition to the trade agreement comprises unions, environmental, consumer groups \u2013 in other words, the entire Democratic base,\u201d says Wallach. Wallach says that the agreement is based on the terms of the US-Korea free-trade agreement, which were derived from Nafta. The complications include limits on food safety and a ban on the export of gas derived from fracking \u2013 which \u201cwould limit our ability to have energy policies to combat the climate crisis\u201d, Wallach says. Another complication: the terms of the TPP won\u2019t be open to debate. A fast-track treatment is likely, with Congress implementing the deal without changes. \u201cThe president wants the authority to railroad through Congress to sign the agreement even before Congress,\u201d explains Wallach, saying it delegates congressional authority to the president. Yet Obama insists that the TPP\u2019s terms are new and improved. The president\u2019s only advice to critics: \u201cDon\u2019t fight the last war.\u201d \u2018It copies and pastes US law into international law\u2019 The Trans Pacific Partnership, although billed as a trade agreement, includes provisions on intellectual property and copyright that are usually outside the boundaries of trade, critics say. For instance, there is a scuffle around the TPP\u2019s rumored treatment of Digital Rights Management tools, which corporations use to limit access to digital devices \u2013 often to prevent piracy. TPP has provisions that make it a crime to break these locks, and to do things that aren\u2019t even copyright infringement. \u201cThese DRM laws prevent us from doing that research legally,\u201d says Maira Sutton, a policy analyst at Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cThat\u2019s our main concern.\u201d Sutton objects that the TPP will extend problematic US laws into international law. One example: the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which prosecutors used to hound open-web advocate Aaron Swartz. \u201cSimilar provisions in the TPP that will prevent whistleblowers and journalists from accessing or \u2018disclosing\u2019 trade secrets through a computer system,\u201d Sutton says. Sutton adds that the recent Sony hacks would not be reported freely under the provisions of the TPP, says Sutton. The third issue the EFF is concerned with is that of intermediary liability, which burdens ISPs and websites with stricter copyright infringement laws in a way that is veiled censorship, cautions Sutton. Climate activists up in arms Climate activists have been the most vociferous in opposing the TPP\u2019s many terms. As John Fullerton wrote in the Guardian: \u201cWhat few seem to realize is that this agreement, if approved as is, could make it virtually impossible for the United States to meet its current and future climate pledges.\u201d Elizabeth Warren too has come out against the deal. In a letter to Froman last year, Warren and two other Senators objected that the TPP \u201ccould make it harder for Congress and regulatory agencies to prevent future financial crises\u201d. Warren and others have raised concern over a provision called \u201cinvestor-state dispute settlement\u201d which gives foreign corporations the political power to challenge US laws in front of a small private group of attorneys that answers to no country. \u201cIf the foreign country prevails, the panel can order compensation from American taxpayers without any review by American courts,\u201d Warren warned. One such panel in 2006 forced the Czech Republic to pay $236m to a Dutch bank for not providing it with a bailout, Warren wrote. Even though dissent is plenty, the means for these public advocates to get involved in the TPP are few. Public interest groups that want to be on trade advisory committees in order to participate in the negotiations are required to sign non-disclosure agreements, which robs them of the voice to object. Sutton, of the EFF, says it is the organization\u2019s responsibility to share information with the public and to do public advocacy. \u201cIf we were to sign on to this trade advisory committee to influence the text, then we tie our hands behind our backs to do the work that we need to do,\u201d she tells the Guardian.",
