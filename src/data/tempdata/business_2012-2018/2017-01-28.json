      "bodyText": "While the lack of female chief executives in the UK is a problem, the lack of female engineers is an even bigger concern, as Dorothy Thompson, chief executive of Drax group, knows only too well. The head of the UK\u2019s largest power station is grappling with the question of how to attract more women into the energy sector. Thompson says the six places available on the Drax apprenticeship scheme this year attracted just two female applicants compared with 76 men. The education is partly to blame, she says, but energy companies also need to do much more to change girls\u2019 perceptions. Thompson has overseen Drax\u2019s conversion of its coal-fired boilers to biomass to secure the future of the plant near Selby in North Yorkshire as environmental rules bite. She is one of a tiny pool of women running big UK companies, and an even smaller number at the top of the energy industry. The proportion of women on the boards of energy companies was 9% in 2014, and exactly the same two years later. The gender imbalance is not much better further down the management chain. \u201cWe would like to have more female apprentices, more female engineers. We believe in diversity,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is challenging. In our current [recruitment] process, there\u2019s a real paucity of female candidates. We struggle to get sufficient candidates to increase the percentage [of women].\u201d She says that while schools should do more to encourage girls to study science and subjects that could equip them for a career in energy, much of the responsibility in addressing the imbalance lies with the industry. \u201cPart of it is in education but part of it is perception. We as an industry need to be more proactive in explaining how interesting an opportunity we are [to young women],\u201d she says. Thompson is far from alone in recognising the imbalance or trying to do something about it. \u201cThis is a huge cultural issue for the industry,\u201d says Joan MacNaughton, who is on the board of Powerful Women, a group helping females advance their career in the sector. \u201cThere are expectations of women that I don\u2019t think are 21st century. It\u2019s a very, very male culture.\u201d MacNaughton, who spent five years at French company Alstom\u2019s energy division and sits on the board of Energy Academy Europe, says even energy companies that like to think of themselves as progressive have a problem. \u201cThey\u2019re not Jeremy Clarkson [the men]; they\u2019re cultured, well-mannered people. But the assumption in senior circles is that you can all have a conversation about your yachts. As a woman there who doesn\u2019t have a yacht, you just have to walk away.\u201d EDF, which is building Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station in two decades, has been running a cinema ad campaign as part of its drive to encourage girls and young women to study disciplines that could lead to energy jobs. \u201cTo recruit the numbers needed to fulfil demand for the future, we need more girls to study science subjects at school, further education and higher education,\u201d says the French company\u2019s boss, Vincent de Rivaz, in a foreword to a recent EDF jobs report. Dr Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers agrees: \u201cOften women don\u2019t see heavy industry as a likely future career. Maybe it\u2019s because of the way we talk about engineering and the way it\u2019s shown on TV and talked about in schools.\u201d The root of the problem is not just in education but society more widely, she adds. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a teenager you want to fit in, and society doesn\u2019t say to girls, \u2018yay, go out and build power plants\u2019.\u201d Sara Bell, founder of technology company Tempus Energy, says while it is still vital to encourage girls to study Stem subjects \u2013 science, technology, engineering and mathematics \u2013 the industry has to look at how it presents itself. \u201cI used to work in financial markets, which is a pretty testosterone-fuelled environment. The energy sector makes finance look like an equal opportunities employer,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of 15-year-old girls will look at the role models \u2013 middle-aged men, predominantly white \u2013 and not see anything they can relate to.\u201d Drax\u2019s Thompson agrees that the lack of role models is an issue. \u201cIt is unfortunate that there are not more senior women in energy, because it would make it appear more accessible to women. I think it\u2019s unfortunate because the industry is in fact perfectly accessible.\u201d Alice Gill should know. As a schoolgirl she was taken on a tour of the power station and now, at 22, after taking biology, maths, chemistry and physics A-levels, she has just completed a four-year apprenticeship scheme with Drax. \u201cA lot of women are, like, girly girls, aren\u2019t they?\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine them coming in in overalls with no makeup on, and getting their hands dirty. It\u2019s not necessarily a problem with the industry [the lack of women]; I think the problem is that people just aren\u2019t interested.\u201d The solution, she thinks, is to expose more women to the sector at young age: \u201cJust educate more people about it.\u201d Other remedies proposed for addressing the energy industry\u2019s gender imbalance include better transparency on promotions inside companies, and much closer scrutiny of hiring practices. \u201cEveryone should have to monitor the [gender] figures, the intake and promotion figures into middle management, and from middle management into board,\u201d says MacNaughton. \u201cWhen you get the transparency, then people start to see the problem and fix it. There will never be a single bullet for such a complex problem.\u201d The Drax dilemma Dorothy Thompson\u2019s 12-year reign at Drax has seen her dramatically transform what it does and where it\u2019s going. She foresaw the end of coal in the UK long before ministers announced in 2015 their plan to phase out all coal power by 2025. Three of Drax\u2019s coal-fired generators have been converted to burn wood pellets, mostly from North American forests. But the company suffered a setback in 2014 when the government ruled that a fourth unit would not be eligible for subsidies, and another in 2015, when the Treasury ended its carbon tax exemption. Drax is lobbying for a rethink, arguing that the UK needs stable low-carbon power to complement increasing amounts of wind and solar energy, but the prospect of a further subsidy is unlikely. The company signalled a new strategy last year with its acquisition of business energy supplier Opus Energy and four gas power stations, and is also looking to buy more wood pellet plants in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s all about diversifying our earnings, strengthening their stability, and using our areas of expertise and our commercial position to make us stronger and more sustainable - in every sense of the word,\u201d Thompson told the Observer. But some analysts are sceptical of how profitable this will be. \u201cDrax\u2019s acquisition of Opus Energy heralded the start of a new strategy focusing on securing earnings beyond 2027,\u201d investment bank Jefferies said in a recent note. \u201cWe feel optimism regarding the new strategy is overdone and we continue to believe that long-term power prices will remain low.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On an icy weekday afternoon in Hackney, a part of east London not on most tourists\u2019 itinerary, Burberry\u2019s discount outlet store is bustling with tourists from China. There is much buzz around the footwear department, and shoppers are checking out ponyskin handbags at \u00a3649 \u2013 down from \u00a31,295 \u2013 and trench coats discounted to around \u00a3900 from nearly \u00a31,300. As the year of the monkey gives way to the year of the rooster on Saturday, Britain\u2019s retail industry is hoping for more visitors from the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Flight bookings from China to the UK are up 88% on 2016 for the Chinese New Year holiday period, which runs from 18 January to 1 February, according to market research firm ForwardKeys. Wen Ying, one browser at the Burberry outlet, cites the low pound: \u201cSuper brands are cheaper here than in our country because of the value of the pound and because of taxes. The local British brands are very attractive because of the high quality.\u201d While they haven\u2019t bought any Burberry goods yet, she reckons the Loake loafers her partner bought earlier are 30% cheaper than at home. At a nearby outlet centre, with discount designer goods from Matches, UGG, Anya Hindmarch and Pringle of Scotland, nearly every shop has a Mandarin-speaking assistant and some stores say that up to 70% of their shoppers are visiting from China. Harvey Nichols, the upmarket department store on the other side of London, said that it had Cantonese and Mandarin-speaking staff on hand at its tills to accept China Union Pay, a popular Chinese payment service. The post-Brexit vote fall in the value of the pound, which has made Britain 11% more affordable for visitors from China, has combined with an easing of the visa system and an increase in the number of direct flights to make the UK a hot destination. Chinese shoppers are particularly good news for the UK\u2019s retail sector asthey are big spenders, spending an average of \u00a32,174 each during their stay \u2013 about three and a half times the average of other visitors. Patricia Yates, director of tourism at VisitBritain, said the evidence was that the Chinese opt for mid-price accommodation so they can concentrate on acquiring luxury goods, particularly handbags and purses and other personal accessories. Watches and jewellery are also popular. The New West End Company, which represents retailers on London\u2019s premier shopping districts of Oxford Street and Regent Street, said sales to Chinese shoppers were up 121% year on year in the week ahead of the main holiday period. \u201cTo put this into perspective, domestic and European spend in the same period were up by just 10.2% and 12.6% respectively,\u201d said Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of New West End Company. Many shops are now catering to these high spenders. Selfridges and Harrods are among a number of retailers now offering Alipay, the Alibaba-spawned payment system which is the most common way to pay for goods in China. Stores are offering Rooster-themed products, Chinese calligraphy or handing out treats in traditional red envelopes. In general, British brands have been enjoying a boost from tourist spending since last summer\u2019s Brexit vote. This month Burberry said sales in the UK surged by 40% in the final three months of 2016 with Chinese shoppers thought to be a major contributor. Mark Henderson, chairman of Savile Row taylor Gieves &amp; Hawkes and the London Luxury Quarter which includes St James\u2019s and Bond Street, said retailers in the area were expecting \u201cgood double digit\u201d growth this Chinese New Year compared with the last. Gieves &amp; Hawkes recorded a 35% uplift in sales in December compared with last year and Henderson expected that pace of growth to continue. \u201cChinese new year is always good as there are a tremendous number of Chinese students in the UK and their family come over. The dip in the exchange rates made things markedly cheaper than anywhere else for a period until prices adjusted but it\u2019s still 20% lower than in mainland China,\u201d he said. However, in Hackney one Burberry shop assistant says the outlet is not as busy as several years ago, when coachloads of visitors linked to the Chinese government would turn up. A crackdown on corruption in China has meant limits on luxury spending by such groups. Experts say the latest wave of Chinese tourists are more sophisticated, travel independently and interested in visiting cultural attractions around the UK as well as doing some shopping. Helena Beard, a consultant from China Travel Outbound, who advises organisations such as the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich on how to attract Chinese tourists, says: \u201cThere is a fast-growing affluent middle class and millenials, many of whom speak English and have a more adventurous spirit than their parents.\u201d She says luxury goods shopping will still be high on their list but they will also be looking for good quality restaurants, particularly seafood, and cultural attractions from Stonehenge to anything linked to the monarchy or flagged by celebrities on social media. VisitBritain\u2019s Yates adds that Chinese tourists are more willing to travel around the UK than visitors from other countries and keen to see Scotland, the Lake District or Oxford. Retailers hope places such as Hackney remain high on the list too.",

Harvey Nichols, the upmarket department store on the other side of London, said that it had Cantonese and Mandarin-speaking staff on hand at its tills to accept China Union Pay, a popular Chinese payment service.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6e2dd65863eb9fcdbb18768a1cecaa281cf2206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6e2dd65863eb9fcdbb18768a1cecaa281cf2206/0_199_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shoppers at Burberry\u2019s discount outley in Hackney, east London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers at Burberry\u2019s discount outley in Hackney, east London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The post-Brexit vote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/british-pound-given-boost-by-projected-remain-win-in-eu-referendum\">fall in the value of the pound</a>, which has made Britain 11% more affordable for visitors from China, has combined with an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/14/george-osborne-china-visa\">easing of the visa system</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/deal-to-double-flights-between-uk-and-china-takes-off\">increase in the number of direct flights</a> to make the UK a hot destination.</p> <p>Chinese shoppers are particularly good news for the UK\u2019s retail sector asthey are big spenders, spending an average of \u00a32,174 each during their stay \u2013 about three and a half times the average of other visitors. </p> <p>Patricia Yates, director of tourism at VisitBritain, said the evidence was that the Chinese opt for mid-price accommodation so they can concentrate on acquiring luxury goods, particularly handbags and purses and other personal accessories. Watches and jewellery are also popular.</p> <p>The New West End Company, which represents retailers on London\u2019s premier shopping districts of Oxford Street and Regent Street, said sales to Chinese shoppers were up 121% year on year in the week ahead of the main holiday period.</p> <p> \u201cTo put this into perspective, domestic and European spend in the same period were up by just 10.2% and 12.6% respectively,\u201d said Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of New West End Company.</p> <p>Many shops are now catering to these high spenders. Selfridges and Harrods are among a number of retailers now offering Alipay, the Alibaba-spawned payment system which is the most common way to pay for goods in China. Stores are offering Rooster-themed products, Chinese calligraphy or handing out treats in traditional red envelopes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5aea2939635e55d3b6b8ee3d531995c1d2359aa3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aea2939635e55d3b6b8ee3d531995c1d2359aa3/0_249_3888_2332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A golden rooster souvenir\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A souvenir rooster on sale in London\u2019s Chinatown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amer Ghazzal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In general, British brands have been enjoying a boost from tourist spending since last summer\u2019s Brexit vote. This month Burberry said <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/18/burberry-sales-surge-thanks-to-weak-pound\">sales in the UK surged by 40% in the final three months of 2016</a> with Chinese shoppers thought to be a major contributor.</p> <p>Mark Henderson, chairman of Savile Row taylor Gieves &amp; Hawkes and the London Luxury Quarter which includes St James\u2019s and Bond Street, said retailers in the area were expecting \u201cgood double digit\u201d growth this Chinese New Year compared with the last. </p> <p>Gieves &amp; Hawkes recorded a 35% uplift in sales in December compared with last year and Henderson expected that pace of growth to continue.</p> <p>\u201cChinese new year is always good as there are a tremendous number of Chinese students in the UK and their family come over. The dip in the exchange rates made things markedly cheaper than anywhere else for a period until prices adjusted but it\u2019s still 20% lower than in mainland China,\u201d he said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/18/burberry-sales-surge-thanks-to-weak-pound\">Burberry sales soar \u2013 from \u00a314 nail varnish to \u00a328,000 alligator coat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, in Hackney one Burberry shop assistant says the outlet is not as busy as several years ago, when coachloads of visitors linked to the Chinese government would turn up. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/30/chinese-anti-corruption-crackdown-former-top-general\">crackdown on corruption in China</a> has meant limits on luxury spending by such groups.</p> <p>Experts say the latest wave of Chinese tourists are more sophisticated, travel independently and interested in visiting cultural attractions around the UK <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/02/uk-retail-chinese-tourists-golden-week-surge-tills\">as well as doing some shopping</a>.</p> <p>Helena Beard, a consultant from China Travel Outbound, who advises organisations such as the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich on how to attract Chinese tourists, says: \u201cThere is a fast-growing affluent middle class and millenials, many of whom speak English and have a more adventurous spirit than their parents.\u201d</p> <p>She says luxury goods shopping will still be high on their list but they will also be looking for good quality restaurants, particularly seafood, and cultural attractions from Stonehenge to anything linked to the monarchy or flagged by celebrities on social media. </p> <p>VisitBritain\u2019s Yates adds that Chinese tourists are more willing to travel around the UK than visitors from other countries and keen to see Scotland, the Lake District or Oxford. Retailers hope places such as Hackney remain high on the list too. </p>",
