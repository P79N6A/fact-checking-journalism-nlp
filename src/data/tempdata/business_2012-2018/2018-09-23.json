      "bodyText": "World oil production will soar to new records over the next five years, as a dramatic expansion in demand from airlines offsets the arrival of electric cars, according to a report from Opec. In a forecast that will dismay environmentalists \u2013 and which questions the theory that oil company reserves will become \u201cstranded assets\u201d \u2013 Opec\u2019s annual report significantly revised production estimates upwards. Most of the production increase will come from countries outside Opec, led by explosive growth from frackers in the United States, with China and India leading the increase in demand. Opec expects global oil demand to reach nearly 112m barrels per day by 2040, driven by transportation and petrochemicals. That is up from almost 100m today and higher than last year\u2019s projection. Coal will continue to be be burned in record amounts, despite concerns about its impact on climate change. Opec estimates that coal usage in the OECD countries will plummet by a third by 2040, but it will increase by 20% in developing countries to reach five times the volumes burned in the west. The world\u2019s airlines will be the single fastest growing user of oil, increasing consumption by 2.2% a year on average, to 2040. However, the largest absolute growth is expected to come from road transport. The number of vehicles on roads across the world are expected to leap from 1.1bn now to around 2.4bn in 2040. In its central scenario, Opec expects just 320m of those to be electric, a number that climbs to 720m in a scenario where battery-powered cars take off rapidly. It said that if the higher prediction for electric cars came to pass, oil demand would only slip slightly to 109m bpd rather than 111.7m bpd by 2040, the report said. Opec revised downwards its forecast for the market share of diesel vehicles because of the fallout from the dieselgate scandal and electric strategy announcements by carmakers over the past year. Renewable energy production will rise rapidly but even by 2040 will meet only around 20% of global energy demand by 2040, according to projections in the report. The price of crude oil has jumped from about $50 (\u00a338.29) a barrel in late 2016 to highs of $80 this summer, partly due to the cartel\u2019s agreement with Russia to cut production for 18 months. Although the Opec report shies away from making price predictions, motorists are unlikely to see much in the way of relief on the forecourts. Earlier this month, the International Energy Agency warned there was a risk of oil prices spiralling higher in the coming months, posing a dilemma for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he looks to raise fuel duty. Most oil companies expect peak oil demand will occur in the 2030s, while more bullish predictions say it could come in the 2020s as climate change regulations bite. Opec, which was meeting in Algiers on Sunday to discuss how to share out an increase in output to bring down prices, sees the US as soaking up most of the growth in production over the next 10 years. \u201cUS tight oil is projected to grow very strongly in the period 2018\u201320, albeit slowing a bit thereafter, and to peak \u2026 in the latter half of the 2020s,\u201d the World Oil Outlook report said. While the group admits the US will beat it in the short run, it believes an American peak in the late 2020s will mean Opec remains relevant in the long run. It hopes to increase its share of world oil supply from 34% now to 40% in 2040. The report doubts whether the pro-fossil fuel regulatory pushes by the US president, Donald Trump, will help the US oil industry, citing the fact that production soared under the \u201coverly burdensome\u201d regulatory environment it faced under Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.",

      "bodyText": "Downing Street is war-gaming a snap general election. The Sunday papers are alive with stories that Theresa May is weighing up the possibility of seeking public support for her Brexit strategy. Voters could soon be trooping off to polling stations to elect a government for the third time in little more than three years. Given the disastrous result the last time the prime minister went down this route, it seems likely that May would only call a general election as a last resort. That said, the events of the past week mean that anything could happen. Labour is aware of that and will now be kicking itself that it spent the summer embroiled in an internal row about antisemitism rather than devoting all its attention to formulating policies and selling them to the public. The need to reach outwards is particularly important when your policy proposals are radical and the public mood is cynical, yet it was telling that Andrew Marr spent a lot more time on his BBC TV show questioning Jeremy Corbyn about racism than he did about what a Labour government would do in office. Labour\u2019s approach to economic policy has changed fundamentally since the days when Tony Blair and Gordon Brown accepted much of the Thatcherite settlement, thinking the idea was to make markets more efficient and fairer. But Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, believe there is something structurally wrong with UK capitalism that needs to be fixed. In that respect, it is right to say that Corbyn and McDonnell want to turn the clock back to the 1970s and the analysis that underpinned Tony Benn\u2019s Alternative Economic Strategy (AES), the thrust of which was that curing Britain\u2019s economic problems was a supply-side matter that necessarily involved more than simply pumping up demand. Reflation was part of the original AES, but it also included public ownership, economic planning, import controls, industrial democracy, price controls and hostility to what was then called the European Economic Community. This was the pre-globalisation era, but even back then supporters of the AES said multinational companies were gouging consumers through excessive prices, shifting jobs overseas and using transfer pricing to avoid paying UK tax. The similarities with current Labour economic policy are obvious. Certainly, McDonnell would end austerity and increase public spending. But, as with the AES in the 1970s, the critique goes deeper. Put simply, the financial crisis of a decade ago exposed deep flaws in the UK\u2019s economic model that have manifested themselves in low investment, weak productivity, a shrunken manufacturing base and a chronic trade deficit. McDonnell\u2019s remedy is consistent with that diagnosis. He has pledged to balance the government\u2019s current spending, with any increases in day-to-day outlays on things such as public sector pay matched by increases in taxes on the richest 5% of voters and higher corporation tax. There would, though, be extra borrowing to pay for \u00a3250bn of public investment over 10 years and funding for a national investment bank. To an extent, this leaves Labour at the mercy of the financial markets. If the City takes fright at McDonnell\u2019s plans, the result will be that he will have to pay higher interest rates for his extra borrowing, with a dampening impact on growth. This argument \u2013 that public borrowing inevitably crowds out private investment \u2013 looks less compelling in the light of the massive increase in the budget deficit during and after the financial crisis, which occurred without any significant change to the interest rate paid on government bonds. The need to keep the markets onside does, however, explain why McDonnell has no plans to abolish the operational independence of the Bank of England. There is a simple reason why he has been quietly touring City institutions in the past few months to sell his strategy to the bankers: for Labour to be radical, it also has to be credible. That\u2019s because there is going to be plenty in Labour\u2019s next manifesto that the City and business in general are going to hate. There will be push back against the proposal to require firms that employ more than 250 people to reserve a third of the seats on their boards for worker representatives and to put a chunk of their profits into employee ownership funds. There will be letters to the papers from business leaders in the run-up to the next election warning of the baleful consequences of a 50% rate of income tax, of a financial transaction tax, and of reversing the cuts in corporation tax since 2010. Any Labour supporter who thinks the battle with these entrenched vested interests is going to be easy is kidding themselves. The power of capital \u2013 especially financial capital \u2013 is far greater than it was when the AES was being pieced together four decades ago. What\u2019s more, some aspects of Labour\u2019s economic strategy seem fuzzy. Are price controls on the public utilities consistent with using a stream of income from water and energy companies to pay the bill for re-nationalising them? How would the Bank marry its 2% inflation target with McDonnell\u2019s plan for a 3% productivity target, when one involves demand and the other supply? There are those, on both the left and the right, who think this is all academic. The public, they say, did not buy this sort of radical stuff in the 1970s and early 1980s, and will not buy it this time either. This, though, might prove to be yet another false assumption. Thatcherism, a rightwing economic strategy, emerged out of the crisis of social democracy. Today it is conservative economics that is in crisis. As Robert Skidelsky says in his new book, Money and Government, a model that offers such \u201cfabulous rewards to a financial plutocracy\u201d has to be \u201cfabulously successful to command allegiance\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Is this year\u2019s Labour conference in Liverpool going to rise to the occasion and put the party firmly on the road to stopping Brexit? With mounting support among trade unionists for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d, it would be a welcome outcome if what my old friend and Observer colleague Alan Watkins called \u201cthe people\u2019s party\u201d finally got its act together in the interests of the country and all working people. It was Liverpool in the early 1980s that witnessed the nadir of Labour\u2019s near-capture by the extreme-left Militant Tendency. The shameful absurdity of it all was captured in a magnificent conference speech by Neil Kinnock, in which he had scathing words for a council under the control of one Derek Hatton that had sent redundancy notices to council workers by taxi. Redundancy notices? Yes, the council\u2019s funds were being so mismanaged that \u201ceconomies\u201d were deemed necessary. That notice of these economies was being sent to the victims by taxi was surreal. Last time I visited Liverpool, for the Labour conference two years ago, I was hailed by several proud denizens who, spying strangers, asked me to spread the news about the impressive developments in the city since the early 80s. A good start on the road to Liverpool\u2019s recovery was made, with that great, go-getting Conservative minister Michael Heseltine inspiring various physical infrastructure projects, and (full disclosure) my late father-in-law, Maurice Stonefrost \u2013 probably the country\u2019s leading expert in local authority finance at the time \u2013 producing the Stonefrost report, to rescue the city\u2019s financial infrastructure. Alas, local authorities have not been the flavour of the current decade, with austerity-obsessed Conservative governments, and savage economies \u2013 or cuts \u2013 to services being applied throughout the land. Such needless social disruption undoubtedly contributed to the disillusionment that lay behind the result of the 23 June referendum in 2016. Which brings me to a timely new book by David Coats, a research fellow at the Smith Institute and former head of the economic and social affairs department at the Trades Union Congress. Entitled \u2013 echoing TS Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land \u2013 Fragments in the Ruins: The Renewal of Social Democracy, it is a rallying cry for Labour to step back from a return to the early 80s in Liverpool and \u201cmake capitalism work for everybody\u201d rather than follow \u201csome illusory politics of transformation, by uprooting all existing institutions and replacing them with who knows what\u201d. As Eliot wrote elsewhere: \u201cHuman kind cannot bear very much reality.\u201d Coats captures the mood that led so many Labour voters to opt for Leave. It was \u201cmore than anything, a cry of protest, a howl of pain and an assertion that the economic and social status quo was unacceptable\u201d. Of course, this also frightened the Labour members for such constituencies who, not to put too fine a point on it, have been worried about their future position. But the crucial point is that leaving the European Union would do absolutely nothing to alleviate the concerns of \u201cleft-behind\u201d voters. On the contrary, all the evidence is that it would be a national catastrophe. To make things worse, it would be caused not by some external shock over which we have no control, but by ourselves. It is therefore time for the leadership of the Labour party to, well, show some leadership. We need less of the defeatist attitude of the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, who also happens to be my local MP. In an extensive interview with the Financial Times last week \u2013 an interview that gave the impression the FT takes her seriously as a possible successor to Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 we were told that \u201cshe is unenthusiastic about another Brexit referendum\u201d. Thornberry said: \u201cWe can\u2019t turn around and say, \u2018Sorry we don\u2019t like your decision, you\u2019re too stupid, whatever, we\u2019re not going to pay attention to what you say.\u2019\u201d Well, as regular readers will know, I myself would prefer parliament to \u201ctake back control\u201d, stand up and be counted, and vote to ignore the \u201cadvisory\u201d referendum and keep us in the EU. But the people\u2019s vote being advocated so assiduously by the indefatigable Lord Adonis and his growing band of followers would be preferable to lame acceptance of the referendum result. With due respect to Thornberry, there are quite a lot of people who voted Leave who are now becoming more aware by the day of the economic and social damage that potentially lies in store. To advocate a rethink, in the light of events and the showing-up of the Brexit campaign for its blatant lies, is not to say they are stupid.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A trade war between China and the US that lasts 20 years or more is a barely believable idea. It offers an Orwellian vision of ceaseless and debilitating battles between trading blocs \u2013 battles that give politicians a convenient enemy and the leverage to impose themselves domestically. Yet Jack Ma, the billionaire boss of Alibaba, one of China\u2019s largest companies, says that everyone should prepare for a fight between the two mega-economies to drag on for at least the next two decades. Ma\u2019s views should not be dismissed lightly. He has been at the centre of trade between the US and China ever since Alibaba became the Chinese equivalent of eBay and Amazon rolled into one. And Ma has done more than most to ease tensions \u2013 by saying he would create a million jobs in the US (a promise he says can no longer be honoured). He believes it is possible that Donald Trump and the next three or four US presidents will maintain a surcharge on the import of Chinese goods now that the American people are persuaded that their economy acts as a piggy bank for the world to rob. Ma says Beijing should now understand that its 40-year project of improving China\u2019s living standards by exporting huge amounts of stuff to the US is over. The next 40 years will be about exporting to the fast-expanding economies of the Middle East and Africa and even to Europe, which lies at the end of the Silk Road. It is a situation that China\u2019s communist leaders have been considering since the 2008 financial crash, when it became obvious that the inherent instability of the US economy was a long-term problem. President Xi Jinping\u2019s answer is what is called the belt and road plan, which he hopes will build trade links along a \u201cbelt\u201d of land routes \u2013 to the north-west through Russia and to the south-west through Turkey \u2013 and a \u201croad\u201d of shipping lanes. The infrastructure deals on offer from Beijing have failed to gain much traction so far. President Macron was initially enthusiastic, but then said the price of China\u2019s financial and logistical help was too high. Kenya, initially keen on a free-trade agreement with China, pulled out earlier this year, saying the terms of the agreement would have crushed its fledgling manufacturing and construction industries. So the US remains an important destination for Chinese goods, and will do for some time. Maybe that is why Beijing followed the softly, softly approach adopted by Mexico and Canada in response to Trump\u2019s belligerence. Last week, China increased trade tariffs on only $60bn of US goods, in response to the US\u2019s slapping duties on $200bn of Chinese imports. Beijing knows that with the US midterm elections looming in November, the US president was primed to go further if provoked. Sure enough Trump tweeted: \u201cThere will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!\u201d The outcome of these skirmishes matters. Yet there is an inevitability about a long-drawn-out war, given that both countries are \u2013 almost at the same time \u2013 entering an arc of decline brought on by ageing populations. This makes the battle for technological advances and intellectual property even more intense. In Trump\u2019s game plan, tariffs on imported goods are the same as a wall: they offer protection from enemies that seek to undermine you. However, any trade economist will tell him that protecting tech giants such as Apple and Intel from the surge in Chinese innovation only makes the situation worse. It encourages complacency. In the end, the demise of firms protected from competition becomes inevitable. That is why Trump\u2019s advisers \u2013including Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, economic chief Larry Kudlow and trade negotiators Peter Navarro and Robert Lighthizer \u2013 are fighting among themselves over the timing and scope of tariffs. It\u2019s possible the dispute could be truncated by the intervention of the World Trade Organisation, which has volunteered to mediate. That, however, could just be wishful thinking.",

    "webTitle": "Dressed to kill: will Boohoo\u2019s results leave high street chains in tears?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Will the brisk rise of online fashion company Boohoo continue? Incoming chief executive John Lyttle will certainly be hoping so: a \u00a350m bonus payout depends on it. The retailer\u2019s interim results, out on 26 September, will illustrate whether the strong growth the company has been enjoying of late has continued. In June, it reported that sales had increased by more than 50% in the previous three months compared with the previous year as young consumers flocked to buy its inexpensive clothes. It emerged last week that Lyttle had been poached from Primark, where he was chief operating officer, and is in line for a multimillion-pound bonus if shares in the company rise by 180% over the next five years. This would have the effect of increasing Boohoo\u2019s stock market value from about \u00a32bn to \u00a35.6bn. It is a formidable task for Lyttle, who starts in the position next March. The Aim-listed company has grown considerably since it was set up in 2006 by Mahmud Kamani and his business partner, Carol Kane. The duo previously worked as wholesalers supplying chains such as Primark and Topshop, and shared the role of chief executive. They will both remain on the board after Lyttle joins. Boohoo has grown by winning sales from traditional high street retailers, and attracting a generation of shoppers that buy via mobile phone and take style influences from social media. Last Christmas, sales doubled as young women turned to its website for party outfits and gifts. It also saw a burst of sales around November\u2019s Black Friday promotion, when items were discounted by between 30% and 60%. The Manchester-based company, which also owns the PrettyLittleThing [PLT] and Nasty Gal online brands, specialises in low-cost clothing and targets young shoppers with limited finances. Its main competitors are high street chains such as Primark, New Look, Miss Selfridge and H&amp;M. But since 2011, Boohoo\u2019s sales have risen 24-fold to about \u00a3580m for the year to February, boosted by promotional deals with celebrities such as England and Tottenham Hotspur footballer Dele Alli. The potential bonus payout to Lyttle has raised eyebrows at a time when executive pay packets are looming large on investors\u2019 radar.

      "body": "<p>Will the brisk rise of online fashion company Boohoo continue? Incoming chief executive John Lyttle will certainly be hoping so: a \u00a350m bonus payout depends on it.</p> <p>The retailer\u2019s interim results, out on 26 September, will illustrate whether the strong growth the company has been enjoying of late has continued. In June, it reported that sales had increased by more than 50% in the previous three months compared with the previous year as young consumers flocked to buy its inexpensive clothes.</p> <p>It emerged last week that Lyttle had been poached from Primark, where he was chief operating officer, and is in line for a multimillion-pound bonus if shares in the company rise by 180% over the next five years. This would have the effect of increasing Boohoo\u2019s stock market value from about \u00a32bn to \u00a35.6bn. It is a formidable task for Lyttle, who starts in the position next March.</p> <p>The Aim-listed company has grown considerably since it was set up in 2006 by Mahmud Kamani and his business partner, Carol Kane. The duo previously worked as wholesalers supplying chains such as Primark and Topshop, and shared the role of chief executive. They will both remain on the board after Lyttle joins.</p> <p>Boohoo has grown by winning sales from traditional high street retailers, and attracting a generation of shoppers that buy via mobile phone and take style influences from social media. Last Christmas, sales doubled as young women turned to its website for party outfits and gifts. It also saw a burst of sales around November\u2019s Black Friday promotion, when items were discounted by between 30% and 60%.</p> <p>The Manchester-based company, which also owns the PrettyLittleThing [PLT] and Nasty Gal online brands, specialises in low-cost clothing and targets young shoppers with limited finances. Its main competitors are high street chains such as Primark, New Look, Miss Selfridge and H&amp;M. But since 2011, Boohoo\u2019s sales have risen 24-fold to about \u00a3580m for the year to February, boosted by promotional deals with celebrities such as England and Tottenham Hotspur footballer Dele Alli.</p> <p>The potential bonus payout to Lyttle has raised eyebrows at a time when executive pay packets are looming large on investors\u2019 radar.
