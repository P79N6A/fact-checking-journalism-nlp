      "bodyText": "FirstGroup is to continue running the Great Western rail route until 2019 after winning another contract extension from the government. The Department for Transport has confirmed it wishes FirstGroup to run the line for an additional term after the current contract runs out. FirstGroup\u2019s continued tenure is controversial as the transport operator had cut short its contract in 2011 in order to avoid paying more than \u00a3800m in premium payments to the government. However, DfT plans to retender the contract had to be scrapped in the wake of the West Coast mainline fiasco. Instead, FirstGroup was offered an extension until 2015 on more favourable terms as the government kept the franchise system ticking over, with the DfT confirming a further extension until 2019 on Friday. The DfT argues that with a long-term programme of works on the route, including electrification of the track and the introduction of a new fleet of IEP trains, it would prove too disruptive to change operators. The uncontested deal will maintain some foothold in rail for FirstGroup, which has been beaten to a string of contracts, including losing its former First Capital Connect franchise to the new Thameslink franchise, and the shock loss of Scotrail for the Aberdeen-based group to Dutch firm Abellio. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: \u201cAs part of the government\u2019s long-term economic plan I want to see rail travel in the South West transformed. That is why we are delivering a huge programme of electrification and new, modern trains bringing faster, more comfortable and more reliable journeys. \u201cFirst Great Western is best placed to help to deliver these projects over the next four years. \u201cThroughout this period we will continually be looking at new ways to improve the service for passengers including developing proposals for a half hourly service between Plymouth and Penzance which could also serve Exeter.\u201d Unions and Labour have condemned the direct awards for First Great Western. While the terms of the latest extension are to be negotiated, figures obtained by the shadow transport secretary, Mary Creagh, showed that FirstGroup\u2019s payments to the government had plummeted from \u00a3169m a year in 2013 to \u00a317m a year under the first direct award granted under the coalition, which sees FirstGroup run the line until mid-2016.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest property website has rebuffed claims that the housing market is heading for a slowdown, with a forecast that prices will soar by 30% over the next five years to average \u00a3318,000 in England and Wales and more than \u00a3715,000 in London. But for the first time in more than a decade, it will be markets outside the capital that lead the way in price rises, Rightmove said. It predicts that Southampton will see the fastest house price increases in the country, with values expected to jump 43% by 2019 \u2013 adding nearly \u00a3100,000 to local prices \u2013 while Luton, Brighton and Swindon will not be far behind. Rightmove used independent consultancy Oxford Economics to calculate the figures. The driving force for prices in the south-east will be the \u201cspillover\u201d effect of high London prices rippling through the home counties. But Rightmove said the parts of the capital that have seen the greatest price increases in the last five years will see the smallest in the coming five years. It predicts price growth of 13.6% in well-off parts of west London, and it names Enfield in north London \u2013 until now one of the cheapest property areas in the capital \u2013 as the borough that will see the biggest gains. It said average prices in Enfield will rise from \u00a3381,000 to \u00a3531,000 or 39% \u2013 equal to an increase of \u00a3575 every week for the next five years. The prospect of house prices rising at the rate forecast by Rightmove will put homes further and further out of the reach of first time buyers. It said the average price in England and Wales will rise from \u00a3244,192 to \u00a3317,967 \u2013 a gain of \u00a373,775 or \u00a314,755 a year. The report claims to be \u201cthe most comprehensive house price forecast of its kind ever created, based on property and economic data rather than opinion and short-term market factors. It takes into account both asking and sold prices, surveyor valuations and analytics from the Oxford Economics\u2019 global, industry and regional forecasting models.\u201d The figures contrast with widespread reports of a cooling in the property market after the frenetic rate of increases in the past year and a possible rise in interest rates next year. On Thursday, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said prices in London fell for the first time since January 2011, ending the longest unbroken run of increases in more than 20 years. \u201cFading price momentum is more than just a London story,\u201d it added. Halifax this week said house price growth has peaked and will now grow at a considerably slower pace, while the Centre for Economics and Business Research is forecasting price falls in 2015. But the forecasting model used by Oxford Economics, which includes factors such as a rising population, a poor supply of new homes, and a recovery in incomes, suggests any slowdown could be short-lived. Substantial parts of Britain still have average prices which remain below their 2008 peak and separate figures published on Friday by estate agents Your Move and Reeds Rain show prices have on average risen by 2% a year nationally since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007. Anna Brosnan, head of campaigns at the National Housing Federation, said: \u201cThese new figures make disturbing but predictable reading. Every part of the country, north and south, is feeling the effects of the housing crisis and if we want the situation to improve for the next generation, action needs to be taken now to build more homes at a price people can afford. \u201cWe have found that eight in 10 people don\u2019t believe any of the main political parties will effectively deal with housing.

      "body": "<p>George Whitesides, Nasa\u2019s former chief of staff, holds up a model of a delicate white spacecraft. With the long narrow wings of a glider, it looks almost too fragile for its intended journey to the edge of earth\u2019s atmosphere.</p> <p>But this slender frame is carrying the dreams of 700 aspiring astronauts: private citizens who have paid up to $250,000 (\u00a3155,000) per head to Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic for the chance to take a trip to the stars. Now chief executive of Galactic, Whitesides\u2019 mission is to turn the British entrepreneur\u2019s vision of a commercial spaceline into reality.</p> <p>\u201cWe are living through one of the greatest periods of innovation in aerospace since the dawn of the space age,\u201d says the quietly spoken Bostonian. Whitesides is not a natural salesman, but he is passionate about his project. \u201cThe amount of new ideas that are coming up and the amount of new capital that is being infused is really exciting, and I really do believe that Virgin Galactic has the potential to be a world changing company.\u201d</p> <p>Galactic is headquartered in California\u2019s Mojave desert, but we are in the London office, where the wall of the marketing suite is covered with an image of the earth seen from space. Whitesides is on a transatlantic mission to dispel growing doubts about whether Virgin Galactic will ever take off.</p> <p>The project has been a decade in development and burned through $500m, and the completion date has moved so often that Private Eye magazine has begun keeping a <a href=\"http://www.private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=news&amp;issue=1374\" title=\"\">record</a>, under the headline: \u201cBeam us up, Beardie!\u201d The latest forecast is for early 2015: on David Letterman\u2019s television show in September, Branson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5ctnUvHANA\" title=\"\">announced</a> his family would be joining him for the first flight, in \u201cFebruary or March of next year\u201d.</p> <p>Has Whitesides been given a deadline? \u201cNo,\u201d he replies. When will the SpaceShipTwo make its maiden voyage? \u201cSoon.\u201d The answer is understandably guarded. A year ago he told an <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/space-travel-2013-5/index2.html\" title=\"\">interviewer</a> the moment was so close he could \u201ctaste it\u201d. Then a decision was taken in May of this year to change the fuel in the rocket motor, and a whole new round of tests began.</p> <p>As a licensed private pilot, and founder of Yuri\u2019s Night, a yearly celebration of the world\u2019s first space flight, his interest is more than professional. In 2005, George and his wife, the astrobiologist Loretta Hidalgo Whitesides, were among the first to pay for seats on Branson\u2019s spacecraft. The Whitesides were going to take their honeymoon in space.</p> <p>They were married in the valley of the moon in California in 2006, but are still waiting to redeem their tickets. \u201cWe\u2019ll still do our honeymoon, just a little bit later than planned,\u201d he quips.</p> <p>To date, the craft being developed under hangars in the Mojave desert has made only three rocket-powered test flights, all well short of its intended altitude. The model in Virgin\u2019s London office, on the other hand, has certainly seen some use \u2013 one of its tail fins is missing and another is hanging by a thread.</p> <p>Branson\u2019s spacecraft is the brainchild of a engineer called Burt Rutan.

      "bodyText": "George Whitesides, Nasa\u2019s former chief of staff, holds up a model of a delicate white spacecraft. With the long narrow wings of a glider, it looks almost too fragile for its intended journey to the edge of earth\u2019s atmosphere. But this slender frame is carrying the dreams of 700 aspiring astronauts: private citizens who have paid up to $250,000 (\u00a3155,000) per head to Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic for the chance to take a trip to the stars. Now chief executive of Galactic, Whitesides\u2019 mission is to turn the British entrepreneur\u2019s vision of a commercial spaceline into reality. \u201cWe are living through one of the greatest periods of innovation in aerospace since the dawn of the space age,\u201d says the quietly spoken Bostonian. Whitesides is not a natural salesman, but he is passionate about his project. \u201cThe amount of new ideas that are coming up and the amount of new capital that is being infused is really exciting, and I really do believe that Virgin Galactic has the potential to be a world changing company.\u201d Galactic is headquartered in California\u2019s Mojave desert, but we are in the London office, where the wall of the marketing suite is covered with an image of the earth seen from space. Whitesides is on a transatlantic mission to dispel growing doubts about whether Virgin Galactic will ever take off. The project has been a decade in development and burned through $500m, and the completion date has moved so often that Private Eye magazine has begun keeping a record, under the headline: \u201cBeam us up, Beardie!\u201d The latest forecast is for early 2015: on David Letterman\u2019s television show in September, Branson announced his family would be joining him for the first flight, in \u201cFebruary or March of next year\u201d. Has Whitesides been given a deadline? \u201cNo,\u201d he replies. When will the SpaceShipTwo make its maiden voyage? \u201cSoon.\u201d The answer is understandably guarded. A year ago he told an interviewer the moment was so close he could \u201ctaste it\u201d. Then a decision was taken in May of this year to change the fuel in the rocket motor, and a whole new round of tests began. As a licensed private pilot, and founder of Yuri\u2019s Night, a yearly celebration of the world\u2019s first space flight, his interest is more than professional. In 2005, George and his wife, the astrobiologist Loretta Hidalgo Whitesides, were among the first to pay for seats on Branson\u2019s spacecraft. The Whitesides were going to take their honeymoon in space. They were married in the valley of the moon in California in 2006, but are still waiting to redeem their tickets. \u201cWe\u2019ll still do our honeymoon, just a little bit later than planned,\u201d he quips. To date, the craft being developed under hangars in the Mojave desert has made only three rocket-powered test flights, all well short of its intended altitude. The model in Virgin\u2019s London office, on the other hand, has certainly seen some use \u2013 one of its tail fins is missing and another is hanging by a thread. Branson\u2019s spacecraft is the brainchild of a engineer called Burt Rutan. With financing from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, he set out to win the Ansari X Prize for the first nongovernmental team to launch a reusable manned craft into space twice within two weeks. His solution, which remains the model for Galactic, was to build a mothership that would carry the rocket to a high altitude. The rocket, SpaceShipOne, would then decouple and, at a safe distance, fire its own engine. The objective was to reach the Karman line, the notional boundary between earth\u2019s atmosphere and space, some 100km (62 miles) above sea level, before dropping back down to earth. With two flights successfully completed and the Ansari prize bagged, Branson decided to invest. His head of communications, Will Whitehorn, was put in charge of the project.

But the work needed to make the craft safe enough for space tourists was considerable. On two of the six powered flights SpaceShipOne had made before being hung in the Smithsonian museum, its pilot Mike Melvill experienced potentially life-threatening failures. And in 2007, with the project already behind schedule, an explosion during the testing killed three of Rutan\u2019s engineers. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed dramatically as a company,\u201d claims Whitesides. \u201cWhen I joined in 2010 we were mostly a marketing organisation.

      "bodyText": "Tesco has ditched plans to build a huge superstore on Margate\u2019s seafront in the latest sign of the troubled supermarket\u2019s retreat from aggressive expansion. Campaigners have lobbied hard to prevent Tesco opening the store in Kent. Last year the development was approved by communities secretary Eric Pickles, and a judicial review was pending to rule on whether planning permission for the scheme was properly considered ahead of that approval. However, the ailing supermarket group has now written to the site\u2019s landlord, Freshwater Developments, to terminate its contract to operate the 82,000sq ft store. Tesco, which has two smaller stores in Margate, said its change of plan was the result of shoppers switching from large stores towards neighbourhood outlets and the internet. \u201cWe are reducing the number of large stores we open each year as a result of changing customer shopping habits. After careful consideration we have therefore decided not to pursue a new large store in Margate,\u201d a spokesman said. The latest retreat comes after Tesco mothballed two new supermarkets in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, and Immingham, Lincolnshire, as it reassesses its strategy under new chief executive Dave Lewis. Pickles was criticised for backing the Tesco Margate scheme by the self-styled Queen of Shops Mary Portas, who said it showed the government was only paying \u201clip service\u201d to the idea of reviving Britain\u2019s high streets as the store would have a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impact on the town. Margate was among the \u201cPortas Pilot\u201d towns which won \u00a3100,000 in funding to back new ideas to boost trade and refill empty shops on some of the UK\u2019s most battered high streets. Louise Oldfield, a local hotel owner who pushed for the judicial review, said she was shocked that Tesco had pulled out but it was good news for Margate. \u201cWe hope we can now move forward towards a more sustainable proposal for Margate. This proposal would have had a massive impact on the seafront,\u201d she said. She added that the superstore would have pulled business from the local high street and brought big lorries and heavy traffic to the site which sits next to Dreamland, Margate\u2019s derelict amusement park which is being revived. It is not clear whether Tesco\u2019s exit will mean Freshwater will be forced to reconsider its plans. Thanet council said: \u201cThe council is positive about the future of the site given its proximity to the new reimagined Dreamland and the upwards trend of exciting regeneration in the area.\u201d More than two years ago former Tesco boss Philip Clarke admitted that big out-of-town stores were a \u201cless potent force\u201d as shoppers turned their backs on the big weekly grocery shop in favour of home delivery or visits to local stores where they could shop little and often. Less than two months after his arrival at Tesco, Lewis has already put the brakes on three stores as he examines \u201call aspects of the group in order to improve its competitive position and deliver attractive, sustainable returns for shareholders\u201d. He is battling to revive the retailer\u2019s sales and also restore calm after the discovery of a \u00a3250m accounting black hole relating to the possible misreporting of payments for suppliers. Freshwater was unavailable for comment.",

      "body": "<p>A year after privatisation at 330p, Royal Mail shares stand at 402p. That\u2019s an improvement of 22%, unexceptional by the standard of past government sell-offs. So was Vince Cable right all along? Was the state\u2019s sale of a 60% stake in the postal service really a rip-roaring success that delivered fair value to taxpayers?</p> <p>\u201cThose who rushed to judgment on the Royal Mail flotation a year ago are having to think again,\u201d said the business secretary himself <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/vince-cable-hindsight-shows-royal-mail-sale-has-achieved-its-objectives-9771623.html\" title=\"\">in the Independent last week</a>.</p> <p>He has a point about the share price, of course. The peak was 618p in January but the \u201cfroth\u201d has blown away, just as he said it would. Investors have realised that the rise of online shopping is not a free lunch for parcels firms. The delivery market is over-supplied and Amazon, Royal Mail\u2019s biggest customer, is trying to build its own network.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ofcom, the regulator, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2014/may/22/royal-mail-ofcom-competition-concern\" title=\"\">so far unmoved by the cry that TNT is unfairly \u201ccherry picking\u201d</a> by planting its postmen in densely-populated cities while ignoring the hills, dales, highlands and islands, all of which Royal Mail must serve at a uniform price.</p> <p>Yet the criticism of the privatisation \u2013 at least in this column \u2013 was never solely about price. It was the process that was flawed.</p> <p>First, it was naive to sell 60% in a job-lot if one aim was to protect the public purse. Royal Mail was always going to be hard to value. It was operating under a new regulatory regime; it owned lots of freehold property of disputed value; its cost of borrowing would plunge when it escaped the harsh terms imposed by government. To minimise the risk of a mis-pricing, it would have been better to sell, say, 20%, let the price settle and then offer more shares.</p> <p>Second, the government, led by its City advisers, locked itself into a traditional \u201cbook-building\u201d process. There was little freedom to react if demand was strong. An auction might have achieved a better result.</p> <p>Third, the ambition to endow Royal Mail with a group of long-term \u201ccornerstone\u201d investors was well-intentioned but the execution was cack-handed. In no sense could the likes of New York hedge fund Och-Ziff, one of the financiers behind the Glazer family\u2019s leveraged takeover of Manchester United, be considered long-termists.</p> <p>In short, the privatisation price looks better with the passage of 12 months. But the process behind the flotation still looks haphazard and too dominated by City advisers. The review of how the government sells assets, now in train under Lord Myners, is still needed.</p> <h2>Icahn jars on Apple</h2> <p>Blimey, Carl Icahn goes on a bit. The activist investor took 4,500 words to say he\u2019d like Apple to buy back more shares because he thinks they\u2019re cheap. Apple\u2019s share price has improved 50% since Icahn started buying, so he has more right than most to opine about value, but some of the detail in his letter jars.</p> <p>\u201cApple has not announced plans for a TV set and may never do so,\u201d begins one section. That doesn\u2019t prevent Icahn asserting that he expects the company to sell 12 million large UltraHD TV sets in 2015 and 25 million in 2016 at $1,500 (\u00a3930) a pop.

      "bodyText": "A year after privatisation at 330p, Royal Mail shares stand at 402p. That\u2019s an improvement of 22%, unexceptional by the standard of past government sell-offs. So was Vince Cable right all along? Was the state\u2019s sale of a 60% stake in the postal service really a rip-roaring success that delivered fair value to taxpayers? \u201cThose who rushed to judgment on the Royal Mail flotation a year ago are having to think again,\u201d said the business secretary himself in the Independent last week. He has a point about the share price, of course. The peak was 618p in January but the \u201cfroth\u201d has blown away, just as he said it would. Investors have realised that the rise of online shopping is not a free lunch for parcels firms. The delivery market is over-supplied and Amazon, Royal Mail\u2019s biggest customer, is trying to build its own network. Meanwhile, Ofcom, the regulator, is so far unmoved by the cry that TNT is unfairly \u201ccherry picking\u201d by planting its postmen in densely-populated cities while ignoring the hills, dales, highlands and islands, all of which Royal Mail must serve at a uniform price. Yet the criticism of the privatisation \u2013 at least in this column \u2013 was never solely about price. It was the process that was flawed. First, it was naive to sell 60% in a job-lot if one aim was to protect the public purse. Royal Mail was always going to be hard to value. It was operating under a new regulatory regime; it owned lots of freehold property of disputed value; its cost of borrowing would plunge when it escaped the harsh terms imposed by government. To minimise the risk of a mis-pricing, it would have been better to sell, say, 20%, let the price settle and then offer more shares. Second, the government, led by its City advisers, locked itself into a traditional \u201cbook-building\u201d process. There was little freedom to react if demand was strong. An auction might have achieved a better result. Third, the ambition to endow Royal Mail with a group of long-term \u201ccornerstone\u201d investors was well-intentioned but the execution was cack-handed. In no sense could the likes of New York hedge fund Och-Ziff, one of the financiers behind the Glazer family\u2019s leveraged takeover of Manchester United, be considered long-termists. In short, the privatisation price looks better with the passage of 12 months. But the process behind the flotation still looks haphazard and too dominated by City advisers. The review of how the government sells assets, now in train under Lord Myners, is still needed. Icahn jars on Apple Blimey, Carl Icahn goes on a bit. The activist investor took 4,500 words to say he\u2019d like Apple to buy back more shares because he thinks they\u2019re cheap. Apple\u2019s share price has improved 50% since Icahn started buying, so he has more right than most to opine about value, but some of the detail in his letter jars. \u201cApple has not announced plans for a TV set and may never do so,\u201d begins one section. That doesn\u2019t prevent Icahn asserting that he expects the company to sell 12 million large UltraHD TV sets in 2015 and 25 million in 2016 at $1,500 (\u00a3930) a pop. It\u2019s all part of his argument for why the shares should trade at $203, not $101. Well, OK, if one could be confident about those TV estimates, $203 may not be silly. But that\u2019s the problem with tech stocks: some products in development never make it. If there\u2019s spare cash (and, at Apple, there is), the best method is to give the shareholders a special dividend and let them decide for themselves if they want to back their hunches. Next step for Cousins As pointed out here earlier in the week, it\u2019s very odd that Richard Cousins, chief executive of Compass Group, thinks he has enough time to be a non-executive director of Tesco. He quit the same position at Reckitt Benckiser this year saying he needed to concentrate on the day job.Now the rumour mill suggests Cousins could be the next chairman of Tesco, which is definitely not a part-time posting. Is he being lined up as Sir Richard Broadbent\u2019s successor? As it happens, the rumour doesn\u2019t ring true \u2013 at 54, Cousins probably has several years left on the clock as a chief executive. All the same, Compass investors would surely want to know at this point if their successful boss is committed to their company. He can\u2019t comment on the Tesco chairmanship, obviously. But he could explain why he didn\u2019t tell Tesco what he told Reckitt.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight, after another day dominated by fears over the health of the global economy in general, and Europe in particular. A quick reminder of the key points: IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has warned that the eurozone is seriously at risk of sliding into recession unless all countries, and the ECB, do more. Lagarde also signalled that she\u2019d like to see Greece sign up to some \u2018precautionary support\u2019 (perhaps a credit line?) when its current bailout deal ends. She was speaking as she outlined the IMF\u2019s Global Policy Agenda, and warned that global growth remains brittle- highlights start here. And here\u2019s the IMF\u2019s priorities: Lagarde\u2019s comments came on the day in which Germany received its third dose of bad economic news this week. Exports tumbled by 5.8% in August, in the biggest slump since January 2009. Economists say Germany will be lucky to avoid a recession. UK chancellor George Osborne added to the concerns swirling in Europe, saying that the eurozone was already hurting Britain\u2019s economy. And ECB chief Mario Draghi also weighed in, insisting that countries must reform in order to deliver a recovery... He also gave Germany a nudge, saying that countries with spare capacity to spend more should do so: Mario Draghi Took A Not-So-Subtle Swipe At Germany Without Actually Mentioning It By Name And amid the pessimism, the FTSE 100 fell to its lowest level since last October In other news..... The Bank of England left interest rates unchanged again Greece\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen.... ...and it has also sunk deeper into deflation. And a much-loved Greek riot dog has died Back tomorrow. Cheers, and goodnight. GW Another gloomy signal tonight -- Brent crude oil has fallen below the $90 mark for the first time since 2012, as global growth fears linger. Interesting discussion on Twitter tonight about Mario Draghi\u2019s claim that Europe won\u2019t enjoy a recovery unless it implements reforms. Former BoE policymaker Adam Posen, and FT Alan Beattie, are not convinced: The FTSE 100 has just closed at its lowest level in a year, as this morning\u2019s early rally petered out. The index of blue-chip shares fell 50 points to 6431, a fall of 0.8%, adding to recent losses. Fears over the global economy, and the Ebola crisis, weighed on the City. Shares are also down on Wall Street, as yesterday\u2019s revival unwinds. Some traders are expressing disappointment that Mario Draghi didn\u2019t hint at larger stimulus measures, in his speech this afternoon Alistair McCaig of IG says market optimism was squished by this morning\u2019s weak German export figures: Today\u2019s German trade balance figures have confirmed, rather than confounded, the growing fears that rather than leading its fellow members into a healthier recovery, Germany is being dragged ever closer to recession. Here\u2019s Nick Fletcher\u2019s latest market report: Here\u2019s a few more gems from Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, who has been crossing swords with former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers in Washington: Elsewhere in Washington, Mario Draghi is urging politicians to do their bit to help the recovery by implementing reforms and raising the \u2018growth potential\u2019 of their econonomies. The president of the European Central Bank is singing a familiar song, that monetary policy can\u2019t do it all alone. Here\u2019s Draghi\u2019s key message: \u201cPut simply, I cannot see any way out of the crisis unless we create more confidence in the future potential of our economies\u201d.... \u201cgiven demographic trends, raising structural growth will have to take place primarily through productivity\u201d. Draghi warns that: \u201cwithout reform [in the eurozone], there can be no recovery\u201d. The ECB chief also warned that governments must also meet their commitments to fiscal reform \u2013 a warning to France that missing deficit targets would be dangerous. \u201cSo to now call into question not just the letter, but also the spirit of the fiscal governance framework would be self-defeating. If this were to again cast doubt over fiscal sustainability, it would create a risk that borrowing costs, and hence fiscal policies, turn procyclical once more\u201d. Here\u2019s some reaction to Christine Lagarde\u2019s press conference in Washington (coverage starts here). John Gizzi, chief political columnist at Newsmax, says US politicians are not happy about the idea of losing influence at the IMF. But this chart shows why reform is needed: Lagarde\u2019s comments on Greece and the eurozone didn\u2019t get a universally positive response: Christine Lagarde is now on CNBC (that was quick!), warning that Sierra Leone\u2019s economy will be hit hard by Ebola. Finally, Christine Lagarde says she\u2019s looking forward to the IMF\u2019s next meeting in Peru, where the economy had been struggling in recent months. Christine Lagarde declines to comment on the merits of using \u2018purchasing power\u2019 to measure China\u2019s relative economic strength versus America. The bottom line, she says, is that China is growing. Q: How close is the eurozone to becoming the new Japan, asks Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott? We alerted, about a year ago, to the risk of persistent low inflation, says Christine Lagarde. Measures have been taken by the ECB to try and resist and reverse that risk. More, we hope, will be done. And we have now alerted the risk of recession in the eurozone. We are not saying that the eurozone is heading to recession, but that there is a serious risk of that happening if the right things are not done. The key is for both \u201csurplus and deficit\u201d countries to do what they have to do, she concludes. Q: Could there be dangerous spillovers, and spillbacks, when the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates? I cannot predict what the Fed will do, replies Christine Lagarde. Janet Yellen is giving very clear guidance...we can all see what she says. And we can also see delivery of what she has messaged. On spillovers.... the Fed has studied the \u2018taper tantrum\u2019 of 2013, to avoid a repeat. And yes, spillovers can lead to a spill-back of trouble to the country in question. The IMF has tweeted Christine Lagarde\u2019s call on the US to ratify changes to the IMF\u2019s quotas. Now, a question on Greece for IMF managing director Christine Lagarde. Q: After four and a half years, the feeling is that we have had enough austerity and enough pain. The PM has said today that a third bailout won\u2019t be needed, and has sent a team to Washington. So, can Greece make it without the loans of the IMF and the EU? Christine Lagarde replies that \u201cAll countries, including Greece\u201d must decide how they conduct their own finances. We are very pleased that Greece has improved its financial position, she says. But we also believe that going forward, and to deliver a satisfactory environment, it would be in a better position if Greece has \u201cprecautionary support\u201d, she adds. So we are talking about \u201can evolution of the relationship\u201d, but one that will help the country to move on on its own, Lagarde concludes. Q: Are African countries capable of raising debt in the financial markets and using the funds for valuable infrastructure projects? African countries have been very successful recently in issuing sovereign bonds, Lagarde replies. They are seen as safer bets than before. And the IMF plans to share its research on infrastructure spending, to ensure that the money is spent responsibly. Q: IMF data shows that China will overtake the US as the world\u2019s largest economy (on a purchasing power basis), but it currently only has 4% of the voting rights. Does that heighten the need to ratify changes to the IMF\u2019s governance? This is very important, Christine Lagarde agrees, fervently. The US Congress needs to approve legislation to change the make-up of the IMF. This was due in 2012. It is overdue in 2014. I hope it can be ratified under president Obama\u2019s leadership. Here we go. First question.... hasn\u2019t the IMF been calling for these structural reforms for a while? And is infrastructure spending now the best way forward? Lagarde says the IMF strongly supports the idea that infrastructure spending is used to promote growth, at a time when monetary policy is ensuring that credit is available at a very low cost. It addresses the demand, and the supply side, of the economy. And on structural reforms, Lagarde agrees that this issue has been on the table for years. It\u2019s a question of doing it, not just talking about it. Reminder, Christine Lagarde\u2019s press conference is online here. She\u2019ll take questions shortly - currently she\u2019s running through the points mentioned earlier..... Christine Lagarde is running through the IMF\u2019s announcements over the last couple of days; growth forecasts cut, risks of a \u2018new mediocre\u2019, etc.... Christine Lagarde is speaking at a press conference in Washington now. She starts by telling the room that, in an earlier meeting, she has announced that it\u2019s OK for countries fighting Ebola to widen their fiscal deficits. Lagarde admits that IMF colleagues may not immediately support that policy, but it\u2019s a sign that the IMF can change and adapt, even at the age of 70. Here are the IMF\u2019s new policy recommendations included in Christine Lagarde\u2019s new Global Policy Agenda: (if it\u2019s hard to read, this tweet could be easier) It includes more support for economic demand in the euro area (more QE, perhaps?), and for the US to \u201csafeguard financial stability\u201d (when it starts to tighten monetary policy) Christine Lagarde also warns that geopolitical tensions could undermine the already brittle recovery. She cites the conflict in Ukraine, turmoil in the Middle East, and the outbreak of Ebola as factors that could hampering recovery in affected countries, and hurt confidence elsewhere. While the impact of the conflict in Ukraine has been relatively contained to date, further escalation could generate significant negative spillovers, both regionally and globally. These would include disruptions in commodity prices, higher risk aversion in financial markets, and erosion of business confidence in trading partners. Meanwhile, developments in the MENA region could trigger a sharp rise in global energy prices. Finally, a significant expansion of the Ebola outbreak to other countries would pose a significant risk to growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. In her new Global Policy Agenda, Christine Lagarde is spelling out that a brittle, mediocre recovery continues. The envisaged acceleration in economic activity has again failed to materialize. Despite massive and welcome monetary support in major advanced economies and slowing fiscal consolidation, the recovery remains uneven and sluggish. Growth, and hence policy advice, are increasingly divergent across countries. Inflation is still below target in many advanced economies and is a growing concern in the euro area, while unemployment has stayed high.... There are some country-specific factors, including last winter\u2019s bad weather in the US, and the Ukraine crisis.. But still.... the continued weakness of investment and economic activity\u2014six years after the global crisis\u2014suggests that bolder policies and more decisive execution are needed to generate balanced, sustainably higher, job-rich, and inclusive growth. Breaking: Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, is calling on politicians and policymakers to do more to stimulate growth and avoid the global economy hitting trouble again. Speaking in Washington now, Lagarde is demanding \u201cBold and resolutely executed policies\u201d to ward off the danger of long-term mediocre growth, with \u201cunacceptably low job creation and inclusion\u201d. Lagarde wants to see 1) structural reforms to boost growth, help confidence, and create jobs 2) stronger regulation and policy frameworks to prevent the flow of \u201ceasy money\u201d destabilising the financial markets 3) More international \u2018coherence\u2019 to avoid avoid exacerbating existing distortions, particularly regarding financial stability and global imbalance. More to follow..... Heads-up. International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde is due to hold a press briefing in a few minutes to discuss the global agenda for this week\u2019s IMF/World Bank meeting. It\u2019s being streamed live here. Here\u2019s more gloomy analysis of the slump in German exports in August (down an alarming 5.8% month-on-month), from Richard Grieveson of the Economist Intelligence Unit: \u201cComing on the back of the recent plunge in industrial output, this is another disastrous number that tallies with our long-held view that the German economy would suffer badly from euro zone weakness, the exchange of sanctions between the EU and Russia, and slower growth in China. There are reasons to think that the August export and industry numbers are a bit overstated given the strong July readings, but overall the negative trend is painfully clear. We will need a very strong set of data for September\u2014something that the high frequency sentiment indicators suggest we won\u2019t get\u2014for Germany to avoid entering technical recession. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how any of the factors driving the weakness in German industry and exports will disappear in the next 2-3 quarters. Things may well get worse before they get better, and the feed-through channels of external weakness to the domestic economy are pretty clear, given the importance of export-orientated industry for German employment and growth overall. \u201cGermany\u2019s ever-growing importance to aggregate euro zone growth (with the exception of Q2) indicates that things could get very messy in the bloc in the next few quarters. Pressure for monetary and (German) fiscal action to alleviate the downturn will increase, but politically we think the ECB has reached its limit, and higher public spending or investment in Germany will be strongly resisted domestically\u201d Update: Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is making those comments about German growth during an event at Bertelsmann Foundation - here\u2019s a livestream. Some quotes from Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, are flashing up on the Reuters terminal. Sch\u00e4uble, who is in Washington for the IMF/World Bank meetings, is acknowledging that Europe has a growth problem (a problem that is now lapping at Germany\u2019s doorstep). But he is also insisting that budget rules can\u2019t simply be torn up; a blow to hopes that Germany could give eurozone neighbours more leeway. Here are the newsflashes: GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS SOME RISKS AFFECT GERMANY MORE THAN OTHER EURO ZONE COUNTRIES GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS NOW WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR MORE GROWTH IN EUROPE, WILL HAVE DISCUSSIONS IN COMING DAYS GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS EUROPE WILL BE ASKED TO DO MORE ON GROWTH, ALL AGREE SCHAEUBLE: IF WE DON\u2019T STICK TO THE EU BUDGET RULES, MONETARY UNION DOESN\u2019T WORK SCHAEUBLE: GERMANY IS ENGINE OF GROWTH IN EURO ZONE, WE STICK TO 1.5 PCT SCHAEUBLE: WE HAVE TO GIVE MORE PRIORITY TO INVESTMENT From Athens, correspondent Helena Smith writes that the news of riot dog Loukanikos\u2019s death could mark the end of one of Greece\u2019s most turbulent periods -- if the Greek prime minister is to be believed, anyway. Antonis Samaras, currently in Milan for a conference addressing the every worsening problem of unemployment in Europe, has told reporters during his visit that the debt-stricken country is now on the path to growth. He also feels \u2018absolutely confident and very comfortable\u201d about Greece now exiting its EU-IMF bailout programme. Wall Street is taking Carl Icahn\u2019s \u201cDear Tim\u201d letter in its stride.... Activist investor Carl Icahn has called on the board of Apple to speed up its share buyback scheme, before other investors realised that the company is undervalued. In an open letter to the company, Icahn starts by praising CEO Tim Cook and colleagues: As a large Apple shareholder with approximately 53 million shares, we applaud you and the rest of management, especially in light of recent launches and announcements which further validate our view that you are the ideal CEO for Apple... I\u2019m sure Cook is suitably chuffed. But Icahn goes on! Arguing that Apple is really worth a mighty $203 per share today, not the $100.98 at which it closed last night. So, Icahn wants Cook to put Apple\u2019s cash pile to work to buy back shares - driving up the value of other stakes (such as his own, naturally): Therefore, given the persistently excessive liquidity of $133 billion net cash on Apple\u2019s balance sheet, we ask you to present to the rest of the Board our request for the company to make a tender offer, which would meaningfully accelerate and increase the magnitude of share repurchases. Icahn outlines how Apple has a gloriously bright future, thanks to the iPhone, Apple Pay, even the Apple Watch (there\u2019s a flurry of rather optimistic predictions on future product growth) And Icahn concludes by sounding a teensy bit impatient, predicting that lesser investors without his nose for opportunity will probably pile into Apple sooner or later... With more and more funds flowing from mutual funds to index funds (because mutual funds have consistently failed to outperform) the last thing they will want to see is their underperformance exacerbated by remaining underweight Apple as it continues to outperform. As the strength of the earnings growth we forecast materializes, and these funds scramble to correct this mistake, only to find themselves competing in the market to do so, a de facto short squeeze may occur, and we can only hope that the company has repurchased all the shares it can before that happens. Business Insider has uploaded the whole letter. Here comes the weekly US unemployment data..... ...and the number of people filing new jobless benefits claims has fallen again, by 1,000 to 287,000. The four-week average of initial claims also fell, to 287,750, the lowest since February 2006. The \u2018continued claims\u2019 total (people filing jobless claims for at least their second week running), also fell. It hit 2,381m, the lowest since May 2006. Another sign that America\u2019s labour market is in much better shape than Europe\u2019s. But that, of course, raises the question of when the Federal Reserve will bite the bullet and start raising interest rates. So, is George Osborne right to say that Britain is already being affected by the eurozone? Well, there certainly are signs that the strong UK recovery seen earlier this year has faded a little. On Tuesday, for example, the NIESR thinktank predicted that UK GDP rose by 0.7% in the third quarter of 2014, down from 0.9% in April-June (we get the official reading in two weeks). The monthly PMI surveys showed that growth in the UK private sector slowed to a six-month low in September. And July\u2019s trade data showed that 95% of Britain\u2019s export growth was to countries outside the EU. Europe\u2019s economy, meanwhile, has certainly weakened. Its private sector virtually stagnated last month, led by the weak French economy. Eurozone GDP stagnated in the April-June quarter (when Germany fell into recession), and may have grown by only 0.2 or 0.3% in Q3. That\u2019s too weak to make a dent in Europe\u2019s unemployment crisis, and would also have a knock-on effect on UK firms. Here are some more newsflashes from George Osborne\u2019s warning about the eurozone; the chancellor appears to be chivvying the European Central Bank to do more: UK\u2019S OSBORNE SAYS BRITAIN ALREADY BEING AFFECTED BY WEAKNESS IN EURO ZONE UK\u2019S OSBORNE SAYS UK BETTER PLACED TO WEATHER ECONOMIC STORM DUE TO ACTION TAKEN OVER LAST 4 YEARS -BBC UK\u2019S OSBORNE SAYS NEEDS ECB TO DO ITS PART TO HELP EURO ZONE ECONOMY -BBC UK chancellor George Osborne has warned that the weakening eurozone economy is already hurting the UK. Speaking to the BBC, at the start of the IMF\u2019s meeting in Washington, Osborne warned that Britain isn\u2019t \u201cimmune\u201d from events in Europe. Here are the key quotes (via PA): \u201cThis is a critical moment for the British economy. The eurozone risks slipping back into crisis. Britain cannot be immune from that. It\u2019s already having an impact on our manufacturing and our exports,\u201d Osborne adds that Britain needn\u2019t panic: \u201cWe need to send clear message out around the world that we have a stable economy, that our economic plan is working, and that we are not going to deviate from that economic plan so that people around the world know that, while Britain is not immune from what is going on the world, we can take steps to protect ourselves.\u201d Osborne\u2019s warning comes amid a blizzard of bad economic news from the eurozone. Earlier this week, the IMF cut its growth forecasts for Germany, France and Italy, and warned that the eurozone was a key risk to the recovery. As we\u2019ve been covering this morning, economists are concerned that Germany could be falling into recession. Exports plunging in August at their fastest rate since January 2009 (see opening post), and factory orders and production also suffered alarming declines. Four of Germany\u2019s most important economic forecasters have also predicted today that the economy stagnated in the last quarter. The institutes (Ifo of Munich, DIW of Berlin, RWI of Essen and IWH of Halle) warned: \u201cAfter gross domestic product contracted in the second quarter and likely stagnated in the third quarter, the economic engine is finding it difficult to get going.\u201d We have to wait a fortnight to find out how many Bank of England policymakers (if any) wanted to raise interest rates at this week\u2019s meeting. IHS Global Insight\u2019s Howard Archer reckons the MPC was split 7-2, for the third month running: We doubt that any more MPC members joined Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty in voting for an interest rate hike at the October meeting. There has been little indication that any of the other seven MPC members are leaning towards an immediate tightening of policy. The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. That means borrowing costs have been at their current record low since March 2009. It has also left its quantitiative easing programme unchanged, at \u00a3375bn. No surprises there. Sad news from Greece \u2013 Loukanikos, the valiant dog who faced down Greek riot police during the height of the eurozone crisis, has died. Greek media report that Loukanikos (Greek for sausage) passed away peacefully, having retired from protests in 2012. Curiously, there are also reports that poor Loukanikos may have died a few months ago, but it\u2019s only just come to light.... Loukanikos began hitting the headlines in 2010, when the stray hound began appearing in the front line of anti-austerity protests. Athens journalist Damian Mac Con Uladh reports that Loukanikos suffered from his years on the front line. According to Avgi journalist Petros Katsakos, the dog\u2019s health was adversely affected by tear gas and from being kicked from police, forcing him to \u201cretire\u201d from active protest about two years ago. \u201cHe was on the couch sleeping, when suddenly his heart stopped beating,\u201d Loukanikos\u2019 carer told Avgi. Full story here, in Greek. At the height of his fame, Loukanikos even featured in Time Magazine\u2019s review of 2011 (full details). Loukanikos \u2018retired\u2019 in autumn 2012, around the time that the eurozone crisis was easing. He swapped tear gas and riot shields for a gentler life with an Athens family, who offered \u201call the care, love, food and vaccinations\u201d a dog could could need. And now, as The Dawn newspaper puts it, he\u2019s \u201cresting in the shade of a tree on a hill in the centre of the capital\u201d. Here\u2019s some reaction to his death: One of the European Central Bank\u2019s favoured measures of inflation expectations just hit a new all-time low: Elstat has also reported that prices continued to fall in Greece last month, and at a faster pace. The Greek consumer prices index fell to -0.8% in September, showing that deflation accelerated after August\u2019s -0.3%. The decline was even sharper, -1.1%, when measured on an EU-harmonised basis. This means that prices have now fallen for the last 19 months in a row, as wages and pensions have shrunk amid its austerity programme. This chart shows Greek CPI (the blue line) since the start of 2012. A clear deflationary trend. And this chart shows how food, clothing, and education costs have all fallen over the last year, while healthcare costs have risen. And here\u2019s a chart showing how Greece\u2019s labour market has changed over the last year: (the full report is here) Just in: Greece\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen, but still remains extremely high. The jobless rate dipped to 26.4% in July, down from 26.7% in June. That\u2019s the lowest rate since the spring of 2012. Elstat reports that the number of Greek people in work increased by 34,218 in July. The number of people unemployed fell by 12,212. And the number of people classed as \u2018Inactive\u2019 (and outside the labour force) fell by 26,760. Elstat also reported that the jobless rate for those between 15 and 24 was 50.7%, down from 58.2% a year ago. Heads-up. Activist investor Carl Icahn has promised to release an \u201cinteresting\u201d open letter to Apple today. Could he be planning to chivvy Apple CEO Tim Cook to release some of the tech giant\u2019s cash pile, having make a large paper profit on his shares in the company? Holger Sandte, euro economist at Nordea Markets, is less pessimistic than ING about the German economy. Sandte reckons Germany can avoid slipping into recession, if exports and private consumption rebound in September after the August slowdown. We\u2019ll find out whose right next month... The slide in German exports shows how geopolitics is hurting Europe\u2019s economy, says Kit Juckes, foreign exchange expert at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale: Soft German export data really hammer home the impact of the Ukraine crisis on the heart of Europe\u2019s economy. We\u2019re going to see more of this, and mounting pressure on the ECB to act. Nothing good for the euro here, needless to say. Here\u2019s a couple more charts, putting the 5.8% tumble in German exports (details start here) into context: The roller-coaster ride in the stock markets continues. Europe\u2019s stock markets are all rallying in early trading, after last night\u2019s Federal Reserve minutes were more dovish than expected. The realisation that the Fed may be further from raising rates than expected has pushed the FTSE 100 up 51 points, or 0.8%, at 6,534. And traders in Frankfurt aren\u2019t fretting about Germany\u2019s export slump; the DAX is up around 1.2%. Here\u2019s the details: German government debt is strengthening again this morning, driving down the yield (or interest rate) on 10-year bunds to just 0.88%. That\u2019s a remarkable low yield -- in comparison, UK 10-year gilts are yielding 2.21%. That shows nervous investors are valuing safety over profits, and also anticipating further weak growth and low inflation in the euro area. A repeat of Japan\u2019s lost decades? In the UK, the clampdown on payday lenders continues. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has announced that such firms must put the products on display on price comparison websites. It\u2019s worried that, without transparency, all lenders will simply charge the highest repayment rate permissible. Full story: Payday loans shaken up by competition regulator It appears that the slump in German exports was partly due to weak demand from outside Europe. This chart shows how exports to \u2018third countries\u2019, was 4.7% lower in August than a year ago: (alas, there\u2019s not a month-on-month number) Nordea Markets\u2019 Aurelija Augulyte suggests the roots of Germany\u2019s downturn lie elsewhere.... Jamie McGeever of Reuters sums up why August was a cruel month for Germany: ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski says Germany will need \u201ca small miracle\u201d to avoid sliding into recession. August\u2019s slide in exports, along with unexpectedly poor industrial production and factory orders, suggest \u201can extremely sharp stand-still in August\u201d He writes: No more summer miracle but rather a summer horror story in Germany. August trade data just added to the devastating evidence that the entire German economy took a pause in August. Why? Brzeski points to the slowdown in many of Germany\u2019s key exports markets, the Ukraine crisis, and the late German summer holidays. But it\u2019s still not easy to explain. And he\u2019s gloomy about future prospects: Looking ahead, this week\u2019s German data show that in spite of the soccer miracle in the summer, there definitely won\u2019t be any economic miracle. On the contrary, the economy seems to need a small miracle in September to avoid a recession in the third quarter. Germany has suffered another dose of bad economic news; exports have fallen at their fastest rate since the early months of the financial crisis. German exports tumbled by 5.8% month-on-month in August, data released by the Federal Statistics Office shows. That\u2019s the biggest fall since January 2009. Imports also shrank, by 1.3%. It adds to fears that Europe\u2019s largest economy hit trouble over the summer, dragged back by the weakness of the wider eurozone economy. Economists had expected a 4% drop in exports, and a 1% rise in imports. The slump in exports narrowed Germany\u2019s trade surplus, to \u20ac17.5bn from \u20ac22.2bn (on a seasonally-adjusted basis). It\u2019s the third piece of bad economic news from Germany this week! Factory production and new orders, both fell sharply in August. One factor is that German summer holidays were later than usual, meaning more of a slowdown in August. But there\u2019s no argument that the country\u2019s economy struggled during the month..... Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. A relief rally is sweeping the markets today, after the US central bank revealed it is not as close to hiking interest rates as investors had expected. Minutes of the Fed\u2019s last meeting, released last night, showed concerns that the strength of the US dollar will drag back growth, and also keep inflation below target, That triggered a strong rally on Wall Street, as investors who\u2019d expected more hawkish words from the Fed got a very nasty shock. Asian markets have jumped, and Europe is expected to follow when trading begins, reversing some recent losses. Stan Shamu of IG reports: After a long period of underperformance as markets priced in a greater possibility of a rate hike, the Fed minutes seem to have \u2018temporarily\u2019 poured cold water on this notion and given some relief to struggling equities. The main points from the minutes were that the Fed downgraded its growth outlook slightly in the short and medium term due to a stronger projected USD and a slower rate of home price appreciation. Additionally risks to global growth will be a factor and inflation forecasts were revised down a touch. However, the fundamentals of the global economy haven\u2019 t suddenly improved, and Europe in particular looks to be weak..... And with four Fed policymakers due to speak today, giving their own take on the situation, it could be a lively time in the markets. Also coming up today\u2026.. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee is meeting this morning to set interest rates. The MPC is not expected to make any changes; given wage growth in the UK is still weak, and there are signs that the economy may be slowing. We get the decision at noon. The weekly US jobless data comes at 1.30pm BST. ECB president Mario Draghi is speaking at the Brookings Institute in New York, at 4pm BST (11 am Washington) And the IMF\u2019s Autumn Meeting continues; Fund chief Christine Lagarde is expected to outline her policy agenda at 3pm BST\u2026..

The falls accelerated as Wall Street opened, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently 112 points lower after Wednesday's Fed fuelled rise. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The post-Fed minutes exuberance didn't last too long in Europe when reality sank in that Europe's still in trouble after more weak data from Germany and the bankruptcy of Espirito Santo Financial Group offered a reminder of the fragility of the European banking system.",

This was on top of his \u20ac3.5m salary. Former finance director Ildefonso S\u00e1nchez Barcoj topped the spending list, with \u20ac484,200 on his card. All of the directors were political appointees, installed by their respective parties and trade unions. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Moral Sant\u00edn, of the leftwing Izquierda Unida party, used his card to take out \u20ac365,000 in cash. Twenty-two directors continued to use their cards after they had ceased to have any role at the bank. In 2010, Caja Madrid merged with a series of smaller savings banks to become Bankia. On 9 May 2012, the bank reported a profit of \u20ac328m, a figure that was adjusted two weeks later to a loss of \u20ac4.3bn. One year on this was revised to \u20ac19bn, the largest corporate loss in Spanish history. Bankia was bailed out in 2012 by the Spanish government, which took a 45% stake in it. Earlier this year the government sold 7.5% for \u20ac1.3bn. Blesa and the former Bankia chief executive and economy minister Rodrigo Rato have been summoned to appear before a judge to answer questions about the credit card scandal. Four executive directors have between them repaid a total of \u20ac200,000.",

One of the company\u2019s three master brewers is a woman who persevered to get her qualification at Hester\u2019s urging.</p> <p>The push for female representation at the top of companies is not just about securing fairer representation. Studies have shown that companies with women on their boards are less susceptible to groupthink and more alive to risks.</p> <p>Hester says: \u201cIf you can have a mix at a senior level, it\u2019s less likely that anything will be missed. The biggest failure in business is when communication goes wrong somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>But she is wary of talk of \u201cdiversity\u201d as a goal, calling instead for companies to be open minded so that talented women can make it on their own merit.</p> <p>\u201cTo appoint a woman for the sake of diversity is as insulting, if not more insulting, as not appointing them because they\u2019re a woman.\u201d</p> <p>As for women looking to make it to the top, they should stop being too hard on themselves.</p> <p>\u201cWe are our own worst critics. We think if we\u2019re at work and the kids are at home then we\u2019re wrong and if we\u2019re at home because our kids are ill then we\u2019re not doing our job.

The bigger challenge is to carry this through into executive positions, which is a much harder task as it will require a sea change in how organisations identify and develop talented women.\u201d Adnams is now a progressive company, Hester says, but in the male-dominated worlds of brewing and logistics she met resistance along the way. \u201cWhen I became transport manager, one of the directors, who is no longer here, said it was absolutely ridiculous that a woman should be in charge of transport.\u201d When she became the first senior woman manager, \u201cthere were people in the room who thought I shouldn\u2019t be there and I found that quite uncomfortable.\u201d Now, half of Adnams\u2019 executive committee are women, putting them in line to follow Hester into the boardroom. One of the company\u2019s three master brewers is a woman who persevered to get her qualification at Hester\u2019s urging. The push for female representation at the top of companies is not just about securing fairer representation. Studies have shown that companies with women on their boards are less susceptible to groupthink and more alive to risks. Hester says: \u201cIf you can have a mix at a senior level, it\u2019s less likely that anything will be missed. The biggest failure in business is when communication goes wrong somewhere.\u201d But she is wary of talk of \u201cdiversity\u201d as a goal, calling instead for companies to be open minded so that talented women can make it on their own merit. \u201cTo appoint a woman for the sake of diversity is as insulting, if not more insulting, as not appointing them because they\u2019re a woman.\u201d As for women looking to make it to the top, they should stop being too hard on themselves. \u201cWe are our own worst critics. We think if we\u2019re at work and the kids are at home then we\u2019re wrong and if we\u2019re at home because our kids are ill then we\u2019re not doing our job. You can only strive to be the best you can be.\u201d",

Wonga, the biggest online payday lender, was ordered last week to write off \u00a3220m of loans to 375,000 people that it admitted should never have been granted. The advertising watchdog has also banned Wonga from using an advert that fails to mention its 5,853% annual interest rate. Simon Polito, the chair of the CMA\u2019s payday lending investigation group, said: \u201cGreater price competition will make a real difference to the 1.8 million payday customers in the UK. At the moment there is little transparency on the cost of loans and partly as a result, borrowers don\u2019t generally shop around and competition on price is weak. \u201cLower prices from greater competition would be particularly welcome in this market. If you need to take out a payday loan because money is tight, you certainly don\u2019t want to pay more than is necessary. Given that most customers take out several loans in a year, the total cost of paying too much for payday loans can build up over time.\u201d The CMA also recommended that lead generator websites selling potential borrowers\u2019 details to lenders should be clearer about their activities. Many borrowers think the sites are lenders rather than middle-men and do not understand that they sell customers\u2019 details to lenders for fees.",

High street store closures were running at 16 a day in the first six months of this year. That was slightly down on the 18 a day recorded in the fiirst 6 months of 2013, but at the same time the rate of store openings plunged 15% \u2013 meaning the number of stores being left empty has nearly doubled. The new data is part of an analysis of the UK\u2019s top 500 towns by the research firm Local Data Company (LDC) and accountants PwC. Just over 400 shops were left empty over the period \u2013 more than in the whole of last year. Only London and the east of England saw the number of empty shops fall with the east midlands, the north west and west midlands the hardest hit. Pawnbrokers are among the hardest hit \u2013 a sharp contrast to recent years when they have been among the high street\u2019s winners. Their numbers reduced by 7%, the third highest faller behind video rental stores and building societies. A slump in the gold price and a rise in alternative ways to raise cash through payday lenders such as Wonga have caused an about-turn in the fortunes of pawnbrokers, underlined by the collapse and rescue of Albermarle Bond. About a third of the chain\u2019s stores were closed when it went into administration. Rival chains, including H&amp;T, have also closed outlets. Mark Hudson, retail leader at PwC, said: \u201cthis data shows that we are now really starting to see the full effects of the digital revolution and consequent change in customer behaviour play out on the high street.\u201d A survey by Experian earlier this week, which focused on high street changes over the past decade, showed that the number of convenience stores and tattoo parlours had nearly tripled, while travel agents and womenswear shops were in steep decline and video rental outlets have almost entirely disappeared. Matthew Hopkinson, director of LDC, said that many big retailers were reducing their overall number of outlets to reflect a change in shopping habits towards online shopping and large retail parks. He said: \u201cThey now want small stores as a local touchpoint or large stores where they can create an experiential environment and really engage with customers. Where once they would have had three stores including one on the high street now they just want one.\u201d But Hopkinson said the overall picture for the high street was more rosy than the PwC figures suggested because spare space was being taken up by independent retailers.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economic recovery will stall unless there is a national campaign to improve the UK\u2019s export performance, a leading business lobby group has warned. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said a slowdown in UK manufacturing and exports was a warning bell for the economy and must be answered with radical action from businesses and the government. Economists are widely predicting that economic growth slowed between July and September, following 0.9% growth in the second quarter. The first official estimate will be published on 24 October by the Office for National Statistics. The British Chambers of Commerce said the strong growth in manufacturing at the start of the year had run its course, with more factories running below full capacity and exporters concerned about a stronger pound which makes UK goods more expensive abroad. John Longworth, director general of the BCC, said: \u201cWe may be hearing the first alarm bell for the UK economy, but this need not be the case. \u201cThe disappointing decline in exports highlights that we must do something radically different. Britain faces a major challenge in improving its trade performance, so we must waste no time in supporting trade opportunities to overseas markets which offer sustained growth. Only a concerted national campaign and sustained investment will allow more UK firms to look beyond our shores for growth opportunities.\u201d The BCC\u2019s survey of more than 7,000 businesses across the UK found that manufacturers experienced a sharp slowdown in sales growth at home and abroad in the third quarter. A balance of +16% of manufacturers reported a rise in export sales, down from +30% in the second quarter. It was the lowest balance since the fourth quarter of 2012. Growth in domestic manufacturing orders was also sharply lower than the second quarter. Companies in the services sector reported a better third quarter, with domestic sales and orders roughly growing at the same rate as the second quarter. However, services companies also reported that export sales grew at the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2012. The survey is a reminder of the scale of the challenge facing the government in its bid to rebalance the economy away from consumer spending and financial services and towards manufacturing and exports. The BCC warned in August George Osborne will miss his target of doubling UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020 because the government had failed to \u201cput its money where its mouth is\u201d. It said exports would have to grow by 10% a year to meet the target set by the chancellor in 2012, which appears out of reach given the lack of progress. The BCC has called on the government to freeze business rates for all companies until 2017 when a planned revaluation of premises will take place. It also wants the whole business rates system \u2013 which the BCC says is a barrier to business investment \u2013 to be reviewed and reformed by 2022. Commenting on the BCC\u2019s latest survey, its chief economist David Kern, said: \u201cNoticeable falls in all the export balances and increased signs of slower growth require a forceful policy response. UK growth cannot rely permanently on consumer spending, and on unsustainable current account and budget deficits. Unless exports and investment play a bigger role in growth, the recovery will stall.\u201d The group\u2019s report echoed recent evidence from the Office for National Statistics and other business surveys that manufacturing and the wider economy lost steam in the third quarter. The BCC said concerns over the pound, as well as a worsening outlook for the eurozone, reinforced the case against an early rise in interest rates which the lobby group said would endanger the recovery.",

The first official estimate will be published on 24 October by the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce said the strong growth in manufacturing at the start of the year had run its course, with more factories running below full capacity and exporters concerned about a stronger pound which makes UK goods more expensive abroad.</p> <p>John Longworth, director general of the BCC, said: \u201cWe may be hearing the first alarm bell for the UK economy, but this need not be the case.</p> <p>\u201cThe disappointing decline in exports highlights that we must do something radically different. Britain faces a major challenge in improving its trade performance, so we must waste no time in supporting trade opportunities to overseas markets which offer sustained growth. Only a concerted national campaign and sustained investment will allow more UK firms to look beyond our shores for growth opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>The BCC\u2019s survey of more than 7,000 businesses across the UK found that manufacturers experienced a sharp slowdown in sales growth at home and abroad in the third quarter. A balance of +16% of manufacturers reported a rise in export sales, down from +30% in the second quarter. It was the lowest balance since the fourth quarter of 2012.</p> <p>Growth in domestic manufacturing orders was also sharply lower than the second quarter.</p> <p>Companies in the services sector reported a better third quarter, with domestic sales and orders roughly growing at the same rate as the second quarter. However, services companies also reported that export sales grew at the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The survey is a reminder of the scale of the challenge facing the government in its bid to rebalance the economy away from consumer spending and financial services and towards manufacturing and exports.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/28/osborne-miss-uk-export-target-bcc-warns\" title=\"\">The BCC warned in August George Osborne will miss his target of doubling UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020 </a>because the government had failed to \u201cput its money where its mouth is\u201d. It said exports would have to grow by 10% a year to meet the target set by the chancellor in 2012, which appears out of reach given the lack of progress.</p> <p>The BCC has called on the government to freeze business rates for all companies until 2017 when a planned revaluation of premises will take place. It also wants the whole business rates system \u2013 which the BCC says is a barrier to business investment \u2013 to be reviewed and reformed by 2022.</p> <p>Commenting on the BCC\u2019s latest survey, its chief economist David Kern, said: \u201cNoticeable falls in all the export balances and increased signs of slower growth require a forceful policy response. UK growth cannot rely permanently on consumer spending, and on unsustainable current account and budget deficits. Unless exports and investment play a bigger role in growth, the recovery will stall.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/07/uk-manufacturing-growth-sluggish-in-august\" title=\"\">The group\u2019s report echoed recent evidence from the Office for National Statistics</a> and other business surveys that manufacturing and the wider economy lost steam in the third quarter.</p> <p>The BCC said concerns over the pound, as well as a worsening outlook for the eurozone, reinforced the case against an early rise in interest rates which the lobby group said would endanger the recovery.</p>",

Normally you might think that would mean balancing good signs with some dangers or risks. But no, Blanchard just sees the balancing involving bad now with bad to come. </p> <p>Blanchard suggests that on the one hand \u201ccountries must address the legacies of the global financial crisis, ranging from debt overhangs to high unemployment. On the other, they face a cloudy future.\u201d</p> <p>And just to reinforce the feeling that Blanchard spent the night before writing his foreword staying up listening to Meat is Murder, he concludes this opening paragraph by noting \u201cpotential growth rates are being revised downward, and these worsened prospects are in turn affecting confidence, demand, and growth today\u201d.</p> <p>Geez, Blanchard, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjPhzgxe3L0\">heaven knows I\u2019m miserable now</a>. </p> <p>But never fear.

But this isn\u2019t that bad given that back in April the IMF was expecting the world economy to grow by 3.88% \u2013 so it is really more of a reversion to previous expectations than a sudden downturn. </p> <p>Since the GFC, the IMF has continually been overly optimistic in its projections. In September 2011 it thought the world economy in 2015 would grow by 4.8%, a year later they were expecting it to grow by 4.4%. In October 2013 they had revised down the expected growth to 4.0%, and now it is 3.8%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/6I1j3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The reason for the most recent declines in projections for the world\u2019s growth is a bit complicated, because the economic picture is rather disjointed.

Part of this is because of other downgrades. The euro area continues to be a sad sack of an economic area, with the IMF noting that growth \u201cnearly stalled\u201d there earlier this year.

While the IMF is not forecasting dire times ahead for us, they are rather dreary compared to what we have been used to over the past 20 years. From 1994 to 2007, a minimum of 3% annual GDP growth was almost taken as given, and the average of 3.7% during that period reflects that it would often be much higher. </p> <p>But from now till 2019, the IMF sees 3% growth being as good as it gets:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/GWIKj/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Perhaps surprisingly, this isn\u2019t that bad compared to other advanced economies.
