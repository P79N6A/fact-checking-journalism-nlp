He was interviewed under caution at a London police station before being released on bail pending further inquiries. In a brief statement, the FSA said its searches at a \"London business address and two domestic premises in London and Kent\", were linked to an ongoing investigation it is conducting jointly with Soca. \"The searches and arrest arise out of a complex insider dealing investigation which is being conducted by the Financial Services Authority and the Serious Organised Crime Agency,\" the FSA said.

But unlike the current round of talks, the only interest at stake would be in negotiating a way out for Greek taxpayers \u2013 not in fretting about the precedents any deal would set for other embattled debt-burdened eurozone states. And in the short term, as Athens battled with the chaos of default, all bets would be off.",

      "bodyText": "Tensions are rising in the Falkland Islands as the 30th anniversary of the war between Argentina and the UK approaches. Even Sean Penn has waded into the simmering row over sovereignty of the islands, calling Britain's presence in the Falklands \"colonialist, ludicrous and archaic\" as he criticised Prince William's deployment there. Growing talk about an oil boom in the contested islands doesn't help. Some 8.3bn barrels of oil are thought to be up for grabs in the waters around the Falklands. That compares with UK proven reserves of 5.6bn. However, some believe the prize could be much bigger: some estimates put it at up to 60bn barrels. That dwarfs the 21bn barrels thought to be remaining in the UK sector of the North Sea. Edison Investment Research analysts said: \"None of these figures have of course been proven, although we do know that Sea Lion is already approaching the size of the single largest field discovered in the UK North Sea this century, namely the Buzzard field where total recoverable reserves of more than 550m barrels have been estimated.\" Sea Lion, estimated at just shy of 450m barrels, is the largest oil discovery in the Falklands so far, and is owned by UK-listed explorer Rockhopper. An oil boom is set to transform the Falklands. A report by Edison, Kicking up a Storm in the South Atlantic, says the islands could reap up to $180bn (\u00a3115bn) in royalties and tax as oil companies get drilling. Falklands assembly member Gavin Short said if the oil started flowing the islands would contribute to their defence costs, currently paid entirely by Britain. \"We have always said once we have found out what we have got and it started flowing, then it would be our intention to make contributions [to Britain],\" he said. So good news for the UK government. Argentina's president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, must be fuming. This year oil companies start drilling in the southern basin of the Falklands. Ian McLelland, one of the Edison analysts, told the Guardian that the total 60bn barrel estimate for the region \"doesn't seem like an unreasonable estimate\" given that four wells in the south alone are expected to yield 7.8bn barrels and \"there are dozens of fields\". Every time drilling results from the four wells are released \u2013 they will come 45 to 60 days apart \u2013 tensions are bound to rise. The first results are expected in mid-March. \"The potential prize from tax revenues could weigh heavily on [UK-Argentina] relations if 2012 exploration is successful,\" the Edison report says.In the Falklands drilling race, Rockhopper has been leading the way in recent years, undaunted by initial setbacks. But this is just the start. The southern basin could prove much more lucrative. The Edison analysts say the largest prospect in the southern basin, Loligo, contains estimated resources of 4.7bn barrels, making it the largest drill target anywhere in the world in 2012, and over 10 times more than Rockhopper's Sea Lion. The report concludes: \"In 2012 the focus shifts firmly to the southern basin explorers, where success for Falkland Oil and Gas Limited or Borders &amp; Southern Petroleum will be a game changer for the region. Rockhopper and Falkland Oil and Gas offer the most compelling upside for investors. The biggest winner, however, could be the Falklands itself, with a near $180bn potential prize in royalties and tax on the horizon if 2012 drilling proves successful.\"",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Several economic indicators have improved markedly in recent months. However, a recessionary eurozone and an unstable Middle East still cast a long shadow over prospects for growth", 
      "body": "<p>Since late last year, a series of positive developments has boosted investor confidence and led to a sharp rally in risky assets, starting with global equities and commodities. Macroeconomic data from the United States improved; blue-chip companies in advanced economies remained highly profitable; China and emerging markets slowed only moderately; and the risk of a disorderly default and/or exit by some members of the eurozone declined.</p> <p>Moreover, under its new president, Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank appears willing to do anything necessary to reduce stress on the eurozone's banking system and governments, as well as to lower interest rates. Central banks in both advanced and emerging economies have provided massive injections of liquidity. Volatility is down, confidence is up and risk aversion is much lower \u2013 for now.</p> <p>But at least four downside risks are likely to materialise this year, undermining global growth and eventually negatively affecting investor confidence and market valuations of risky assets.</p> <p>First, the eurozone is in deep recession, especially in the periphery, but now also in the core economies, as the latest data shows an output contraction in Germany and France. The credit crunch in the banking system is becoming more severe as banks deleverage by selling assets and rationing credit, exacerbating the downturn.</p> <p>Meanwhile, not only is fiscal austerity pushing the eurozone periphery into economic freefall, but the loss of competitiveness there will persist as relief at the waning prospect of disorderly defaults strengthens the euro's value. To restore competitiveness and growth in these countries, the euro needs to fall towards parity with the US dollar. And, while the risk of a disorderly Greek collapse is now receding, it will re-emerge this year as political instability, civil unrest and more fiscal austerity turn the Greek recession into a depression.</p> <p>Second, there is now evidence of weakening performance in China and the rest of Asia. In China, the economic slowdown under way is unmistakable. Export growth is down sharply, turning negative vis-\u00e0-vis the eurozone's periphery. Import growth, a sign of future exports, has also fallen.</p> <p>Similarly, Chinese residential investment and commercial real-estate activity are slowing sharply as home prices start to fall. Infrastructure investment is down as well, with many high-speed railway projects on hold and local governments and special-purpose vehicles struggling to obtain financing amid tightening credit conditions and lower revenues from land sales.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Asia, Singapore's economy shrank for the second time in three quarters at the end of 2011. India's government predicts 6.9% annual GDP growth in 2012, which would be the lowest rate since 2009. Taiwan's economy fell into a technical recession in the fourth quarter of 2011. South Korea's economy grew at a mere 0.4% in the same period \u2013 the slowest pace in two years \u2013 while Japan's GDP contracted at a larger-than-expected 2.3%, as the yen's strength weighed down exports.</p> <p>Third, while US data has been surprisingly encouraging, America's growth momentum appears to be peaking. Fiscal tightening will escalate in 2012 and 2013, contributing to a slowdown, as will the expiration of tax benefits that boosted capital spending in 2011. Moreover, given continuing malaise in credit and housing markets, private consumption will remain subdued; indeed, two percentage points of the 2.8% expansion in the last quarter of 2011 reflected rising inventories rather than final sales.

      "bodyText": "Since late last year, a series of positive developments has boosted investor confidence and led to a sharp rally in risky assets, starting with global equities and commodities. Macroeconomic data from the United States improved; blue-chip companies in advanced economies remained highly profitable; China and emerging markets slowed only moderately; and the risk of a disorderly default and/or exit by some members of the eurozone declined. Moreover, under its new president, Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank appears willing to do anything necessary to reduce stress on the eurozone's banking system and governments, as well as to lower interest rates. Central banks in both advanced and emerging economies have provided massive injections of liquidity. Volatility is down, confidence is up and risk aversion is much lower \u2013 for now. But at least four downside risks are likely to materialise this year, undermining global growth and eventually negatively affecting investor confidence and market valuations of risky assets. First, the eurozone is in deep recession, especially in the periphery, but now also in the core economies, as the latest data shows an output contraction in Germany and France. The credit crunch in the banking system is becoming more severe as banks deleverage by selling assets and rationing credit, exacerbating the downturn. Meanwhile, not only is fiscal austerity pushing the eurozone periphery into economic freefall, but the loss of competitiveness there will persist as relief at the waning prospect of disorderly defaults strengthens the euro's value. To restore competitiveness and growth in these countries, the euro needs to fall towards parity with the US dollar. And, while the risk of a disorderly Greek collapse is now receding, it will re-emerge this year as political instability, civil unrest and more fiscal austerity turn the Greek recession into a depression. Second, there is now evidence of weakening performance in China and the rest of Asia. In China, the economic slowdown under way is unmistakable. Export growth is down sharply, turning negative vis-\u00e0-vis the eurozone's periphery. Import growth, a sign of future exports, has also fallen. Similarly, Chinese residential investment and commercial real-estate activity are slowing sharply as home prices start to fall. Infrastructure investment is down as well, with many high-speed railway projects on hold and local governments and special-purpose vehicles struggling to obtain financing amid tightening credit conditions and lower revenues from land sales. Elsewhere in Asia, Singapore's economy shrank for the second time in three quarters at the end of 2011. India's government predicts 6.9% annual GDP growth in 2012, which would be the lowest rate since 2009. Taiwan's economy fell into a technical recession in the fourth quarter of 2011. South Korea's economy grew at a mere 0.4% in the same period \u2013 the slowest pace in two years \u2013 while Japan's GDP contracted at a larger-than-expected 2.3%, as the yen's strength weighed down exports. Third, while US data has been surprisingly encouraging, America's growth momentum appears to be peaking. Fiscal tightening will escalate in 2012 and 2013, contributing to a slowdown, as will the expiration of tax benefits that boosted capital spending in 2011. Moreover, given continuing malaise in credit and housing markets, private consumption will remain subdued; indeed, two percentage points of the 2.8% expansion in the last quarter of 2011 reflected rising inventories rather than final sales. And, as for external demand, the generally strong dollar, together with the global and eurozone slowdown, will weaken US exports, while still-elevated oil prices will increase the energy import bill, further impeding growth. Finally, geopolitical risks in the Middle East are rising, owing to the possibility of an Israeli military response to Iran's nuclear ambitions. While the risk of armed conflict remains low, the current war of words is escalating, as is the covert war in which Israel and the US are engaged with Iran; and now Iran is lashing back with terrorist attacks against Israeli diplomats. The Islamic Republic, with its back to the wall as sanctions bite, could also react by sinking a few ships to block the Strait of Hormuz, or by unleashing its proxies in the region \u2013 the pro-Iranian Shia in Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Moreover, there are broader geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that will not ease \u2013 and that might intensify. The Arab spring has produced a relatively favourable outcome in Tunisia, where it started, but developments in Egypt, Libya and Yemen remain far more uncertain, while Syria is on the brink of civil war. In addition, there are substantial concerns about political stability in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia's oil-rich eastern province, and potentially even in Kuwait and Jordan \u2013 all areas with substantial Shia or other restless populations. Beyond the countries affected by the Arab spring, rising tensions between Shia, Kurdish and Sunni factions in Iraq since the US withdrawal do not bode well for a boost in oil production. There is also the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, as well as strains between Israel and Turkey. In other words, there are many things that could go wrong in the Middle East, any combination of which might stoke fear in markets and lead to much higher oil prices. Despite weak economic growth in advanced economies and a slowdown in many emerging markets, oil is already at around $100 per barrel. But the fear premium could push it significantly higher, with predictably negative effects on the global economy. With so many risks in so many places, investors, not surprisingly, will eventually prize liquidity in their portfolios, while shunning riskier fixed assets again when these tail risks materialise. That is yet another reason to believe that the global economy remains far from achieving a balanced and sustainable recovery. \u00a9 Project Syndicate, 2012",

      "bodyText": "Workers at Unilever's UK operations are to vote on proposals by the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group to resolve an industrial dispute over pension changes. Negotiations at the Acas conciliation service last week between the Unite, GMB and Usdaw trade unions and Unilever executives have produced proposals that will be put to a consultation of more than 2,000 employees. Ballots are expected to follow. A Unite spokeswoman said: \"The company has made proposals which are quite complex. We are in the process of consulting our members on this and we will make further comment in due course.\" She added: \"It is too soon to say whether this will be enough to settle the dispute.\" Staff at Unilever's 12 UK sites have staged 12 days of strikes since December in a dispute over Unilever's decision to close its final salary pension scheme to existing members. The walkouts hit production of Marmite in Burton upon Trent, Pot Noodles in Crumlin, south Wales, and PG Tips in Manchester. Other products made by Unilever in the UK include Hellman's mayonnaise and, on the non-food side, Lynx, Sure, Persil and Comfort. A Unilever spokesman said: \"Following constructive talks on 9 and 10 February at ACAS, Unilever set out arrangements which represent the Company's final position in the hope that they provide a way to resolve the current dispute. The unions have confirmed that these improved arrangements will now be put forward to their members.\" News of the Unilever proposals came as 200 of the group's employees protested outside its Rotterdam headquarters on Thursday. Jennie Formby, a Unite national officer, said: \"We had 200 workers from a number of countries expressing their concern about the cost-cutting that is ongoing within Unilever, following the company's commitment to double revenues over the next 10 years. We will work together to prevent any further attacks on terms and conditions. We will not let Unilever workers pay for the company's profits.\" Unilever said last year that closing its final salary plan was the \"right thing to do\" to guarantee its long-term future in the UK. The company said its final salary scheme had 5,000 active members and a deficit of \u00a3680m.",

Ballots are expected to follow. A Unite spokeswoman said: \"The company has made proposals which are quite complex. We are in the process of consulting our members on this and we will make further comment in due course.\" She added: \"It is too soon to say whether this will be enough to settle the dispute.\"</p> <p>Staff at Unilever's 12 UK sites have staged 12 days of strikes since December in a dispute over Unilever's decision to close its final salary pension scheme to existing members. The walkouts hit production of Marmite in Burton upon Trent, Pot Noodles in Crumlin, south Wales, and PG Tips in Manchester. Other products made by Unilever in the UK include Hellman's mayonnaise and, on the non-food side, Lynx, Sure, Persil and Comfort.</p> <p>A Unilever spokesman said: \"Following constructive talks on 9 and 10 February at ACAS, Unilever set out arrangements which represent the Company's final position in the hope that they provide a way to resolve the current dispute. The unions have confirmed that these improved arrangements will now be put forward to their members.\"</p> <p>News of the Unilever proposals came as 200 of the group's employees protested outside its Rotterdam headquarters on Thursday. Jennie Formby, a Unite national officer, said: \"We had 200 workers from a number of countries expressing their concern about the cost-cutting that is ongoing within Unilever, following the company's commitment to double revenues over the next 10 years. We will work together to prevent any further attacks on terms and conditions. We will not let Unilever workers pay for the company's profits.\"</p> <p>Unilever said last year that closing its final salary plan was the \"right thing to do\" to guarantee its long-term future in the UK. The company said its final salary scheme had 5,000 active members and a deficit of \u00a3680m.</p>",

King added that BAE and the UK would get more value from a potential order from the Oman government, where BAE is the lead contractor in the Typhoon consortium, and the prospect of Typhoon upgrades and the construction of a maintenance facility in Saudi Arabia \u2013 already a major Typhoon customer. \"The added value of a Saudi or an Oman contract is higher to us,\" said King.</p>",

Cutbacks by the UK government have created unease among the ranks of UK defence contractors, with the chair of the aerospace, defence and security trade body warning this month that Britain did not have a \"clear proactive national strategy, with clearly appointed champions to drive it\". King said he agreed with the comments, made by Robin Southwell, who is also boss of EADS in the UK. BAE has cut 22,000 jobs over the past three years, reducing its workforce to 80,000 worldwide. King indicated that BAE would consider cutting the price of the Eurofighter Typhoon to wrest back a $20bn Indian government order from French rival Dassault. BAE's co-developers in the project are Italy's Finmeccanica and EADS, the pan-European aerospace and defence group. \"We are in discussions with our partners on anything that we can do. And if that includes the need, as we consider the bids, to reduce the price then that is something we will look at.\" However, King said that even if Typhoon won the order it would not represent a significant boost for British manufacturing, because only a small number of the jets will be made in the UK. King added that BAE and the UK would get more value from a potential order from the Oman government, where BAE is the lead contractor in the Typhoon consortium, and the prospect of Typhoon upgrades and the construction of a maintenance facility in Saudi Arabia \u2013 already a major Typhoon customer. \"The added value of a Saudi or an Oman contract is higher to us,\" said King.",

      "bodyText": "Gavin Darby, the newly installed chief executive of Vodafone takeover target Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide, has vowed to offshore jobs and simplify a business he described as \"overly complex\" and \"inefficient\". Darby wants CWW to eliminate duplications created by successive rounds of mergers and focus on cash generation by reducing the \u00a3280m capital expenditure of the UK's second largest business telecoms group. \"The business is overly complex,\" Darby told investors in a comprehensive kitchen-sinking of previous management's approach as he unveiled his turnaround plan and delivered an interim statement. \"The full integration of other networks has never been completed. We have over 800 applications to manage, making changes slow and the customer journey slower and sometimes lumpy and inflexible. That clearly has to change.\" Announcing results for the third quarter to 31 December, three days after Vodafone confirmed it was considering a \u00a3700m cash offer for the group, Darby insisted the business was \"fixable\", that his plans were \"achievable today\" and more than just \"PowerPoint charts\". He promised to break with tradition at CWW by forming his plans not just from the \"top down\" but the \"bottom up\". The acquisitions of Energis in 2005 and Thus in 2008 have never been fully bedded in. Some customers still receive three bills, and there is a surplus of real estate: Manchester has 30 locations which management say could be reduced to six. \"There is scope to increase the use of offshore with associated cost reduction,\" Darby added. Head office staff numbers have already been trimmed by 7%, eliminating 100 jobs by the end of March. CWW has struggled to perform since its demerger from sister company Cable &amp; Wireless Communications in Spring 2010 and has lost 70% of its stock market value in a year. It plunged to a half year loss of \u00a3433m in November, prompting the departure of chief executive John Pluthero and the cancellation of the dividend. Darby said he would give details of undisclosed \"medium term strategic initiatives\" in May, at CWW's annual results presentation. He added that market conditions remained \"challenging\" and reiterated full year guidance \u2013 analysts are forecasting a consensus 3% fall in revenues to \u00a32.17bn, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. Despite claims from previous management that CWW would focus on winning data hosting contracts, Darby revealed that the company had not spent the money needed on creating new facilities. \"For whatever reason we didn't invest in data centre capacity enough in 2009 and 2010, and we've not been able to participate in the growth for the last year or so.\" A 15 year agreement was signed in January with a subcontractor to create a new data centre in Heathrow, which will increase capacity by 25%. Expansion is under way at the Leeds and Swindon data centres, and capacity will be boosted overseas. Growth in the data centre business was flat during period, and income from voice services continued to fall by over 10% a year. The market reacted by sending shares down 3% to 26.5p in early trading.",

The currency-related downgrade does not affect group returns, which is the prime concern of Kingfisher's large US investor base. Therefore, we believe that the current valuation still looks too low . The new management incentive scheme targets, for maximum vesting, require a compound annual growth rate of 15% between 2012 and 2015.",
