      "bodyText": "Vince Cable has issued a stark warning to Britain's leading boardrooms that they need to crack down on bonuses to restore public trust and avert the threat of fresh legislation to limit executive pay. The business secretary fired off a warning to the 100 biggest UK-listed companies about the damage big pay deals can have on their image, before Barclays' annual meeting on Thursday, where protests about the bank's \u00a32.4bn bonus pot are expected to be registered by disgruntled shareholders. \"Getting pay wrong damages popular trust in business and undermines the duty to promote the long-term success of the company,\" Cable said, in a letter to directors who chair the remuneration committees that set senior pay at the UK's largest companies. \"I therefore think it vitally important that remuneration committees consider how remuneration policies can genuinely support sustainable value creation and avoid creating unwelcome incentives to focus excessively on short-term goals.\" He added: \"At a time when every part of the economy is striving to get more from less, I hope you find yourselves animated by the same spirit.\" His letter is being sent as the annual general meeting season of leading companies gets into full swing, allowing shareholders to vote on the pay deals of directors. Two years ago, a record number of remuneration reports was voted down by investors. \"There is now an opportunity for companies to make peace with the public,\" Cable said in a BBC interview. These are the first annual meetings since Cable introduced rules requiring companies to give shareholders a binding vote on pay policies for coming years, in addition to the requirement for an advisory vote on the remuneration report that outlines pay deals for the last year. Cable told the heads of the remuneration committees that shareholders had shown their willingness to reject excessive pay deals. \"I hope you agree that we need remuneration committees that act in a similarly active, challenging way. It is, after all, how managers up and down an organisation are expected to behave: getting the very most out of employees, for the very best value for money, rather than trying to find ways of paying the most possible,\" Cable said. It is also the first time that banks are being forced to comply with the European Union's cap on bankers' bonuses, which limits bonuses to one times salary, or twice if shareholders give their approval. This presents a dilemma for the government, which owns stakes in Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. Cable had warned FTSE 100 bosses in a speech last month, when he said that some remuneration committees were ignoring the spirit of a new law intended to improve transparency in the boardroom, that he planned to send the letter. At the time, he warned that he would consider tougher measures unless their behaviour improved, which he said included stricter regulatory oversight of pay reports and policies, forcing shareholders to disclose how they have voted on pay, or making companies consult their employees on pay. Cable told the BBC that bankers' pay was still \"extraordinarily large\". Bankers' pay is also subject to scrutiny because of the EU's cap on bonuses. RBS, which is 81% owned by the taxpayer, is expected to ask for permission to pay bigger bonuses and has yet to disclose if it also intends to hand out \"allowances\" to senior executives to maintain their pay levels. Cable said the government had not yet seen any proposals by RBS, which needs to outline its pay policies by the end of the month. In his letter, Cable warns of the risk of new rules on pay. \"You will be conscious that this issue continues to be the focus of considerable public debate. Unless business is seen to act responsibly, pressure for further action will inevitably result,\" Cable wrote. \"Policies that reward executives out of proportion to the value they create are a clear dereliction of the duty to promote the success of the company for the long term,\" he added. His letter, though, is being sent after the pay deals of Britain's top bosses have already been set and the remuneration committees have already met to discuss bonuses. Barclays, which holds its annual meeting in the Royal Festival Hall in London on Thursday, is in focus as it increased its bonus pot by 10% for 2013 to \u00a32.4bn despite reporting a 32% fall in profits. This appeared to break a pledge by the new boss, Antony Jenkins, to contain bonuses as part of his efforts to clean up the image of the bank following the Libor-rigging scandal. Jenkins attempted to defend the need to raise bonuses by warning of a \"death spiral\" as its bankers left for higher paid jobs at rivals. He is under pressure to cut more costs at Barclays and will outline his plans at a strategy day on 8 May. In the meantime, Barclays confirmed to staff that it was scaling back its global commodities business. \"This decision is in line with Barclays' stated objective to actively evaluate and manage our businesses, ensuring they meet strict economic and strategic criteria within the new regulatory environment,\" Barclays said. In response Chuka Umuna, Labour's shadow business secretary, said: \"After promising to introduce annual binding shareholder votes on remuneration, Vince Cable and the Tory-led government caved in and have failed to match their rhetoric with action.\"",

Valeant has already lined up $15.5bn in financing from Barclays and RBC.<br></p> <p>Both Valeant and Allergan make products that are \u2013 as is Ackman himself \u2013 beloved of New York socialites. Allergan\u2019s Botox neurotoxin and Juvederm filler are popular youth-preservers among the moneyed set, while Valeant makes rival fillers Restylane and Perlane. Valeant is also known to dermatologists as the owner of wrinkle creams Renova and Retin-A Micro. The two companies have a shared past: in the past, Valeant\u2019s sales team \u2013 known for its presence in foreign markets like Asia and Russia \u2013 had a contract to sell Botox in Poland.<br></p> <p>If the deal goes through, Valeant promised to sell off Restylane and Perlane, as well as another filler, Dysport, to make room for Botox.<br></p> <p>The flashy presentation seemed at odds with Valeant\u2019s protectively tended image as a thrifty company.<br></p> <p>Valeant\u2019s chief executive, J Michael Pearson, seemed abashed by the kind of attention that Ackman regularly courts. \u201cValeant still worries about every penny, and this whole production is being paid for by Bill Ackman,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cThis must be what it feels like to be at a big pharma company. This will never happen again.\u201d<br></p> <p>Ackman, along the same lines, told investors about ordering a burrito from Chipotle during the negotiations, only to have Pearson pop his head into the room and ask Ackman for $20 to pay for it.<br></p> <p>On a darker note, Pearson also highlighted Valeant\u2019s frugality by highlighting the executive and administrative layoffs he plans to make if the two companies successfully combine. \u201cThese are not people touching the customers. they are people sitting in offices. and we don\u2019t need people sitting in offices,\u201d Pearson said. He expects layoffs and other cost cuts to result in $2.7bn in savings, 80% of them in the first six months after the deal.<br></p> <p>Still, Pearson and Ackman enjoyed a kind of locker-room banter. When one investor asked Pearson: \u201cwhy team up with Bill, as charming as he is?\u201d Pearson shot back, \u201cHe\u2019s charming?\u201d before explaining, \u201che\u2019s investing $4bn in us.\u201d<br></p> <p>Bonhomie aside, getting the deal done won\u2019t be easy. There are several challenges.<br></p> <p>One is Valeant\u2019s aggressive accounting, which rejects the standard audited measure of US financial statements, which is known as GAAP.<br></p> <p>\"We don't care about GAAP earnings,\u201d Ackman said, adding, \u201cif you look at GAAP earnings, [Valeant] looks like a disaster heading into bankruptcy.\" He said he favored measures of the company\u2019s cash flow instead as a metric of its economic health.<br></p> <p>Another potential sticking point is Ackman\u2019s technique \u2013 buying the shares of Allergan while working with a potential acquirer. It startled even Wall Streeters who have seen it all and made some veteran traders queasy.<br></p> <p>Ackman, who chose the theme \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d for the presentation and sprinkled quotes from bold CEOs throughout the presentation, is very much an insider on the deal.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe got access to inside information, which we don't typically get when looking at an opportunity,\u201d Ackman said of his talks with Valeant. Inside information is a loaded term on Wall Street, where investors aren\u2019t allowed to profit on nonpublic information.<br></p> <p>Ackman, who offered six pages of disclaimers on the deal, said he took an interest in Allergan after finding out Valeant wanted to take over the company. Subsequently, his steady accumulation of Allergan\u2019s shares boosted the stock price from $116 to $142 in a few weeks.<br></p> <p>\u201cI know this is going to raise eyebrows,\u201d said Keith Moore, the managing director of Wall Street research firm MKM Partners, adding: \u201cThis is obviously a new-twist tactic where an activist teams with the buyer.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is aggressive in a way that makes the arbs blanch, and we aren't exactly shrinking violets,\u201d said another trader.<br></p> <p>Suzan Jo, a partner with law firm Duane Morris, said Ackman\u2019s technique, while unusual, was most likely legal because his intent was to acquire an ownership stake in the company, not flip the shares. Ackman also filed the right documents with federal regulators.<br></p> <p>\u201cHis share accumulation was disclosed the entire time,\u201d Jo said.<br></p> <p>By all accounts, Allergan is a vulnerable target, according to Moore of MKM Partners. One of Allergan\u2019s best defenses against hostile takeovers, a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d lapsed in 2010. The poison pill, which had been in place roughly since 1989, is a protection technique that deters hostile takeovers by making a company\u2019s stock prohibitively expensive to buy. The company\u2019s board of directors is also re-elected every year, which makes them vulnerable and easy to replace.<br></p> <p>The Valeant-Allergan offer \u2013 which Ackman dubbed Val-Gan \u2013 is the activist investor\u2019s first foray into the pharmaceuticals industry, but it is unlikely to be the last. He said Valeant is already in talks for its next acquisition, and proposed a passel of high-profile pharmaceutical companies, including Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson, as future takeover targets.<br></p>",

He expects layoffs and other cost cuts to result in $2.7bn in savings, 80% of them in the first six months after the deal. Still, Pearson and Ackman enjoyed a kind of locker-room banter. When one investor asked Pearson: \u201cwhy team up with Bill, as charming as he is?\u201d Pearson shot back, \u201cHe\u2019s charming?\u201d before explaining, \u201che\u2019s investing $4bn in us.\u201d Bonhomie aside, getting the deal done won\u2019t be easy. There are several challenges. One is Valeant\u2019s aggressive accounting, which rejects the standard audited measure of US financial statements, which is known as GAAP. \"We don't care about GAAP earnings,\u201d Ackman said, adding, \u201cif you look at GAAP earnings, [Valeant] looks like a disaster heading into bankruptcy.\" He said he favored measures of the company\u2019s cash flow instead as a metric of its economic health. Another potential sticking point is Ackman\u2019s technique \u2013 buying the shares of Allergan while working with a potential acquirer. It startled even Wall Streeters who have seen it all and made some veteran traders queasy. Ackman, who chose the theme \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d for the presentation and sprinkled quotes from bold CEOs throughout the presentation, is very much an insider on the deal. \u201cWe got access to inside information, which we don't typically get when looking at an opportunity,\u201d Ackman said of his talks with Valeant. Inside information is a loaded term on Wall Street, where investors aren\u2019t allowed to profit on nonpublic information. Ackman, who offered six pages of disclaimers on the deal, said he took an interest in Allergan after finding out Valeant wanted to take over the company. Subsequently, his steady accumulation of Allergan\u2019s shares boosted the stock price from $116 to $142 in a few weeks. \u201cI know this is going to raise eyebrows,\u201d said Keith Moore, the managing director of Wall Street research firm MKM Partners, adding: \u201cThis is obviously a new-twist tactic where an activist teams with the buyer.\u201d \u201cThis is aggressive in a way that makes the arbs blanch, and we aren't exactly shrinking violets,\u201d said another trader. Suzan Jo, a partner with law firm Duane Morris, said Ackman\u2019s technique, while unusual, was most likely legal because his intent was to acquire an ownership stake in the company, not flip the shares. Ackman also filed the right documents with federal regulators. \u201cHis share accumulation was disclosed the entire time,\u201d Jo said. By all accounts, Allergan is a vulnerable target, according to Moore of MKM Partners. One of Allergan\u2019s best defenses against hostile takeovers, a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d lapsed in 2010. The poison pill, which had been in place roughly since 1989, is a protection technique that deters hostile takeovers by making a company\u2019s stock prohibitively expensive to buy. The company\u2019s board of directors is also re-elected every year, which makes them vulnerable and easy to replace. The Valeant-Allergan offer \u2013 which Ackman dubbed Val-Gan \u2013 is the activist investor\u2019s first foray into the pharmaceuticals industry, but it is unlikely to be the last. He said Valeant is already in talks for its next acquisition, and proposed a passel of high-profile pharmaceutical companies, including Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson, as future takeover targets.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Andrew Witty promised to simplify GlaxoSmithKline when he became chief executive six years ago and the three-part deal with Novartis brings the goal in sight. The transaction is not straightforward \u2013 500 lawyers were apparently required to thrash out the details \u2013 but the logic is. Each company will concentrate more resources on what it does best. GSK is selling its oncology products for up to $16bn (\u00a39.5bn), a tidy sum for cancer-treatment business ranked 14th in the industry. It is buying Novartis's vaccines business for up to $7bn, thus strengthening its leadership position there. And the duo's vast collection of toothpastes, painkillers, nicotine gums and other consumer products will be pooled into a joint venture. Compare that with the hassle-heavy nature of GSK's creation with the mega-merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham in 2000. That deal required two attempts after the first, in 1998, fell apart acrimoniously. GSK then embarked on an excruciating process of selecting managers equally from its founding companies while simultaneously reorganising research departments into manageable units. The newly formed UK champion looked dysfunctional. The share price halved in the two years after the merger, not helped by patent expiries and a poor run of results in the labs. The question was asked: was GSK too unwieldy for its own good? Witty, the surprise victor in a three-way internal shootout for the top job in 2008, seemed to think so. He promised a \"new operating model\" with fewer \"white pills in western markets,\" in other words a move away from the old Big Pharma game of screwing the US and European healthcare systems for the highest possible price on blockbuster drugs. Witty also pledged to measure productivity from research in terms of hard returns on capital. That's the context of Tuesday's deal with Novartis. It's a much larger version of the 2009 shuffle in which GSK and Pfizer combined their HIV assets into a joint venture called ViiV. That unit will become one of only four \"key franchises\" at GSK, alongside respiratory (unaffected by the Novartis transaction), vaccines and consumer products. The four divisions will contribute 70% of revenues, a statistic Witty was keen to trumpet on Tuesday. But the emergence of a simpler GSK has only partly cured the share price. At \u00a316.44, up 5% on Tuesday, it stands a third higher than in 2008 but is still below the \u00a320.50 at time of merger. That reflects two things. First, at \u00a320-plus, investors were silly to swallow the millennial boasts that the new discipline of genomics would herald a golden era of drug discovery. Second, while simplifying GSK was the correct strategy, there is no guaranteed route to success in the pharmaceutical business: patents expire and novel products are always needed from the labs. GSK had a good run on approvals in 2013, but the demand for innovation is ceaseless. For the past year, and especially in recent weeks, GSK has been depressed by corruption allegations overseas. Witty's next job is to address that issue definitively. What he has achieved, though, is a radical re-shaping of GSK's activities without resorting to a risky mega-merger. Pfizer, flirting with AstraZeneca, should take note.",

Almost all of the political opposition, however, have argued that the very notion of a primary surplus is a fiction \u2013 cooked up by a government that has not only trimmed the books savagely but failed to factor in basic things like state debts to suppliers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some regular blog readers have also raised concerns over the validity of Athens figures (<a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/34348156\">see this comprehensive discussion from last week</a>)</p> <p><b>Eurostat will give its verdict tomorrow.</b> And with crucial European and local elections in May, prime minister Antonis Samaras will attempt to make as much political mileage out of the achievement as possible. </p> <p>Helena explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Samaras has already vowed to return a full 70% of the surplus to those Greeks most affected by the biting spending cuts and tax increases imposed since the start of the debt crisis. \u201cWe must help those most affected by the crisis, in order to give them a second chance\u201d the leader said, just before Greece returned to the debt markets on April 11. \u201cWe care about those who are in need.

But then the top selling drug in the world at the time - the anti ulcer drug Zantac - went off patent in the US in 1997. Faced with the financial disaster from that, Glaxo decided to merge with Wellcome in 1995, two years before the hit. Then later in 2000, it merged with Smithkline, whilst patents were being lost in other territories.</p> <p>Two large deals around the key patent hit from Zantac. The deals and resultant cost cutting helped to obfuscate the resultant damage to profits. When industries lack top line growth, then M&amp;A occurs - cost cutting provides the profit growth instead. On top of that, drugs are predominantly bought by governments and they are cash constrained. Indebted states will be looking at their drugs' bills and wanting to make cuts. Austerity makes for difficult times in the pharmaceutical industry.</p> </blockquote> <p>Louise also reckons that the recent increase in M&amp;S activity means corporate confidence is returning:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is no longer a case of just hunkering down to avoid the storms. Now executives are willing to take a risk, make an acquisition, sell off a business or float.

      "bodyText": "European markets have returned from the Easter break in positive mood, thanks to the spate of deals, real and reported, in the pharmaceutical sector, writes Nick Fletcher. GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis have announced an asset swap plus plans to merge their consumer businesses, while AstraZeneca has been lifted by talk of a possible approach from Pfizer. Hopes for an easing of the tensions in Ukraine helped to support the positive mood, while US markets were lifted by positive results from technology stocks like Netflix. So the final scores were: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 56.51 points or 0.85% higher at 6681.76 \u2022 Germany's Dax climbed 2.02% to 9600.09 \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.18% better at 4484.21 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 1.49% higher at 21,935.34 \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 1.41% to 10,437.8 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 93 points or 0.57%. On that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back again tomorrow. Elsewhere the trial of Sir David Jones, former executive chairman of the defunct JJB Sports chain, has been put back until February 2015 due to his ill health. Jones was accused of forging a bank statement to disguise the fact he had borrowed \u00a31.5m. The full story is here. The pharmaceutical rally continues to push shares up in Europe -- Shire has now overtaken Glaxo and AstraZeneca at the top of the FTSE 100 risers. Shire is up 7.2% in late trading, even though it isn't actually involved in today's splurge of M&amp;A activity -- clearly analysts reckon the sector is ripe for further dealmaking.... Back to Greece, where more than 200,000 Greeks have rushed to apply for a slice of the primary budget surplus that Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistics agency, is expected to announce the country will officially post tomorrow. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: By midday, today, some 225,000 Greeks had applied for the so-called \u201csocial dividends\u201d the government has vowed to hand out from the primary surplus Athens is projected to have posted in 2013. How much, exactly, that surplus will be is anyone\u2019s guess: at last count, the conservative-dominated coalition had reckoned it would hover around 2.5 billion euro before interest payments \u2013 more than three times the 800 million it had originally estimated. Almost all of the political opposition, however, have argued that the very notion of a primary surplus is a fiction \u2013 cooked up by a government that has not only trimmed the books savagely but failed to factor in basic things like state debts to suppliers. Some regular blog readers have also raised concerns over the validity of Athens figures (see this comprehensive discussion from last week) Eurostat will give its verdict tomorrow. And with crucial European and local elections in May, prime minister Antonis Samaras will attempt to make as much political mileage out of the achievement as possible. Helena explains: Samaras has already vowed to return a full 70% of the surplus to those Greeks most affected by the biting spending cuts and tax increases imposed since the start of the debt crisis. \u201cWe must help those most affected by the crisis, in order to give them a second chance\u201d the leader said, just before Greece returned to the debt markets on April 11. \u201cWe care about those who are in need. Our goal is to exit the crisis without leaving anyone behind.\u201d Most of the benefits \u2013 including a one-off \u2018bonus\u2019 payment of 500 euro \u2013 are expected to be distributed to low-income pensioners and members of the police and security services whose wages, in keeping with the vast majority of those employed in the public sector, have been cut dramatically over the past four years. Highlighting the desperation of ordinary Greeks, around 140,000 scrambled to submit electronic applications since the process was opened last Thursday. But by yesterday nearly half --71,000 -- had been rejected for failing to meet the income criteria and other conditions set out by the government, according to the general Secretariat for Information Systems handling the procedure. With barely a month before May's elections, the radical left main opposition Syriza party has lashed out at the government for peddling vote-catching \u201clies\u201d saying the so \u2013called surplus has been achieved with a surplus of unemployed and poverty stricken Greeks. Earlier today, the government spokesman Simos Kedigoglou hit back at Syriza and its leader Alexis Tsipras saying both were suffering from a \u201csurplus of despair.\u201d \u201cThey betted on catastrophe which never came and now they are distressed by the ever growing signs of exit from the crisis,\u201d he said in a statement. More decent economic news, this time in Europe. Eurozone consumer confidence has hit the highest level since late 2007, according to the EC's monthly survey. IHS Global Insight's Howard Archer suggests Europeans have shrugged off geopolitical worries, thanks to the recent drop in eurozone unemployment. He writes: This suggests that the Ukraine/Russia crisis has still not worried consumers unduly. Low inflation and stabilizing job markets likely buoyed consumers in April. Consumers have recently also been less worried about the recent economic situation and more optimistic about the outlook. It may also deter the European Central Bank from launching new stimulus measures soon -- if rising consumer confidence translates into higher spending, there's less risk of Europe slumping into deflation. Back to the US, and two pieces of economic data have just beaten forecasts. Existing home sales in America fell by 0.2% in March, to an annual rate of 4.59 million new homes. That's the weakest rate since July 2012, but better than expected. And the Richmond manufacturing index has jumped to +7 this month, from -7 in March -- suggesting a healthy rally in activity. Societe Generale's Kit Juckes is cheered, at least for a moment..... Oh, speaking of Thomas Piketty... his book on how capitalism is failing (most of) us by driving up inequality is now topping the bestseller list on Amazon.com: Returning to today's pharmaceuticals deals -- analyst Louise Cooper explains how weaker growth in the drugs sector is driving firms to cut costs: Way back when I first started my career [in 1992, I believe....], pharmaceutical companies were growth stocks - 20-30 times PE - now, its more like 15-18 times for the European majors. But then the top selling drug in the world at the time - the anti ulcer drug Zantac - went off patent in the US in 1997. Faced with the financial disaster from that, Glaxo decided to merge with Wellcome in 1995, two years before the hit. Then later in 2000, it merged with Smithkline, whilst patents were being lost in other territories. Two large deals around the key patent hit from Zantac. The deals and resultant cost cutting helped to obfuscate the resultant damage to profits. When industries lack top line growth, then M&amp;A occurs - cost cutting provides the profit growth instead. On top of that, drugs are predominantly bought by governments and they are cash constrained. Indebted states will be looking at their drugs' bills and wanting to make cuts. Austerity makes for difficult times in the pharmaceutical industry. Louise also reckons that the recent increase in M&amp;S activity means corporate confidence is returning: It is no longer a case of just hunkering down to avoid the storms. Now executives are willing to take a risk, make an acquisition, sell off a business or float. Good news for economic recovery and good news for future corporate investment. A gentle start on Wall Street, where the main stock indices have opened a little higher. The pharmaceutical deal action in Europe this morning is helping prop up the markets, after yesterday's gains (yesterday the US stock market rose for the fifth day in a row, the first time in 2014). Dow Jones: up 22 points at 16471, +0.14% And shares in Netflix have jumped 8%, after the online broadcaster posted good financial results last night (profits and subscribers growth were both up) US house prices rose 0.6% in February, ahead of the 0.5% monthly gain expected by Wall Street. The Federal Housing Finance Agency also reported that prices were 6.9% higher than a year ago. It's figures use home loans made by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, America's two government-sponsored mortgage providers. The pound has been creeping higher today, touching $1.6839 to the US dollar - close to its highest level since late 2009. Some traders are speculating that the minutes of the Bank of England's last monetary policy meeting, released tomorrow morning, could contain signals that interest rates will rise sooner than thought. Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe,says the minutes will be scrutinised for signs that MPC committee members are turning more hawkish, saying: Last month\u2019s minutes revealed a division in the committee over the inflation outlook, a key informant of the first rate hike under the Bank\u2019s new forward guidance. The \u2018range of views among Committee members\u2019 over inflation centered on the how quickly the spare capacity gap would be closed and how much sterling\u2019s appreciation would depress inflation. Average wages have accelerated since August in a sign the economic recovery is eating into the economic output gap. However, inflation continues to fall and the Bank views sterling appreciation as likely to depress price growth in future. Fast food giant McDonald's has missed profit forecasts for the last three months, and reported a drop in sales in America. The fries-to-McFlurry's firm has reported earnings of $1.21 per share, missing Wall Street estimates of $1.24 per share. Revenue growth was also weaker than expected. Like-for-like sales in the US fell by 1.7% in the first three months of 2014, with fewer customers visiting its outlets. McDonalds blamed \"challenging industry dynamics and severe winter weather\" in the January-March period. On a brighter note for the company, sales in Europe rose by 1.4% during the quarter, but it was a mixed picture. McDonald's reported that: Positive sales performance in the U.K., France and Russia was partially offset by ongoing weakness in Germany. President and CEO Don Thompson said that McDonald's priority is \"stabilizing key priority markets including the U.S., Germany, Australia and Japan.\" McDonald's has been hit by tough competition and lacklustre consumer spending in some parts of the globe -- as well as last winter's icy blizzards in the US. Thompson also acknowledged that McDonald's faces a struggle: In the near term, we are prioritizing our efforts around those elements of the restaurant experience that are most impactful - offering the best food and beverage options and delivering outstanding service. For the long term, we are focused on more effectively leveraging consumer insights to guide our global growth priorities of optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to brandMcDonald's. We are intent on pursuing initiatives that will strengthen our relationship with our customers to reignite our business momentum. Here's the full statement. Moody's has warned that Spain's efforts to tackle its debts are hampered by its very low inflation rate, which is unlikely to pick up for some time. In an \"update to the market\" (rather than a rating action), Moody's Investors Service said that Spain's economy is now firmly on an improving trend, but cautioned that its country's borrowing requirements remain too high for comfort. Here's a flavour of the report.... While exports continue to be the main driver of growth, the rating agency also expects domestic demand to contribute positively to growth from this year onwards. However, Spain's public finances are still comparatively weak with high budget deficits and a rising public debt burden until after the middle of the decade. The public finances are on a gradually improving trend as well. The need for all sectors of the economy to reduce their high levels of debt will, however, limit the speed of the recovery. Moody's expects a prolonged period of very low inflation in Spain, which makes the debt reduction a difficult and painful exercise. However, the rating agency does not consider a scenario with outright deflation a probable scenario. But..... Spain's \"elevated\" budget deficit -- which is pushing its public debt ratio higher -- remains its main credit weakness. Public debt levels are close to 100% of GDP, among the highest in the Baa rating category, and have experienced one of the fastest increases in Moody's sovereign universe. While the rating agency expects the budget deficit to be gradually reduced further over the coming years, the public debt will probably only stabilise by 2016. The high borrowing requirements of the sovereign introduce a susceptibility to funding stress that is significantly higher than for most other sovereigns rated in the Baa rating category. Why all this activity in the pharmaceuticals sector? The WSJ has a pithy explanation: Many drugs companies have paid down debt from big acquisitions in the early 2000s and are generating a lot of cash. Generic drug makers are seeking to gain scale as their competitors and customers bulk up. For prescription-drug makers, pressure on pricing in the U.S. and Europe has forced many to cut costs, scale back research and development activities, and think about joining with rivals. More here: Glaxo, Novartis in Pharma Deal Frenzy Over in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland has been fined $6m Hong Kong dollars (or around \u00a3500,000) for internal control failures -- after not spotting that a trader had falsified her records to hide almost \u00a320m of losses. The penalty was imposed by the Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), as Reuters reports: The SFC said in a statement RBS failed to detect and prevent unauthorized trades in its emerging markets rates business in the city in 2011, following the discovery of unauthorized trades by former trader Shirlina Tsang. Tsang was sentenced last year to 50 months in jail after pleading guilty to fraud after was she caught falsifying records of her trades... Tsang was jailed back in September, after admitting creating false bond trading records from mid-2010 until Oct. 14, 2011 to make it appear she was making a profit. More details here. GSK has been holding an analyst call to discuss today's deals with Novartis (buying a vaccine arm, selling its oncology division, and setting up a consumer healthcare joint venture). City analyst Louise Cooper tweets the key points: Back to the big story of the morning, the deal fever in UK pharmaceuticals which continues to drive Europe's stock markets higher. Drugs firms continue to lead the FTSE 100 risers, with AstraZeneca up 7% amid swirling speculation that Pfizer, or a rival, could launch a $100bn bid. While the multi-billion dollar asset swaps and joint venture between Novartis and Glaxo has pushed their shares high too -- GSK are up 5.4% in London, while Novartis has gained 2.5% in Switzerland. Sarah Butler rounds up the news: Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline have agreed a multibillion dollar swap of assets under which the two pharmaceutical firms will join forces in the consumer healthcare sector combining brands including Aquafresh, Beechams and Tixylix and exchange their oncology and vaccine businesses. The deal comes amid a frenzy of takeover speculation in the sector with the US drugs company Pfizer thought to be considering a $100bn (\u00a359bn) bid for AstraZeneca and Valeant Pharmaceuticals looking at Botox-maker Allergan in a $40bn move. Shares in GSK rose 5% to \u00a316.40 and Switzerland's Novartis rose 2.75% to 76.75 Swiss francs in early trading. AstraZeneca rose almost 8% and the UK's Shire jumped 4.6% to \u00a330.62 owing to hopes of more deals to come. GSK shareholders will benefit from a \u00a34bn capital return funded by net proceeds of $7.8bn from the deal, in which the Brentford-based firm is selling its oncology business to Novartis for $16bn and purchasing its new partner's vaccine business for an initial $5.25bn. A further $1.8bn is promised if the division performs well. Novartis, meanwhile, is selling its animal health division to US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly for $5.4bn. Full story: Pharmaceutical shares soar after Novartis and Glaxo deal And over on City AM, Peter Spence has rounded up the best analyst comments on Pfizer's approach to Astra: Last night, Citi\u2019s Andrew Baum suggested that the offer is \"very likely genuine\" after The Sunday Times first reported that a tentative bid had been made. Credit Suisse's Vamil Divan notes that overlap with Lipitor and Crestor could cause some headaches with the Federal Trade Commission, but these \"would not be prohibitive.\" Divan sees synergies in primary care infrastructure, emerging markets, and in combining oncology assets. And Citi's note sees the acquisition fitting into Pfizer's \"key strategic goals for immunotherapy and autoimmune disease.\" Baum says that the deal could transform Pfizer's competitive presence in that sector. Deutsche Bank's Mark Clark is less confident that the bid will materialise, noting that Sunday Times and Bloomberg stories on the deal seem to conflict over when a second approach took place, and that the report remains unconfirmed. \"Bid rumours occur relatively frequently in the Pharma sector - witness market suggestions in the last year of, for example, a Novartis/Roche deal and a US-based approach for Shire, which turned out to be false,\" says Clark. More here: Here's how the City's top analysts think an AstraZeneca-Pfizer deal could play out A couple of Greek news stories to flag up. Greece's prime minister, Antonis Samaras, has predicted that the recovery in the country's bond prices will continue, pushing down borrowing costs (although there are no plans to repeat this month's oversubscribed debt sale). He told the Kathimerini newspaper that: We reached rock bottom and now we can only go up and we will only go up,\u201d Here's the full interview. But a survey by UK academics has highlighted the human cost of hitting 'rock bottom' -- a rise in suicides across Greece since the debt crisis began. My colleague Katie Allen reports today: Echoing official statistics in the UK showing suicide rates are still higher than before the crisis, researchers at the University of Portsmouth have found a correlation between spending cuts and suicides in Greece. According to the research, every 1% fall in government spending in Greece led to a 0.43% rise in suicides among men \u2013 after controlling for other characteristics that might lead to suicide, 551 men killed themselves \"solely because of fiscal austerity\" between 2009 and 2010, said the paper's co-author Nikolaos Antonakakis. \"That is almost one person per day. Given that in 2010 there were around two suicides in Greece per day, it appears 50% were due to austerity,\" he said. Here's the full story: Austerity in Greece caused more than 500 male suicides, say researchers Construction activity in the eurozone inched a little higher in February, according to Eurostat's latest survey this morning, suggesting that Europe's recovery from recession remains weak but steady. Eurostat found that production by eurozone construction firms rose by 0.1% month-on-month, and was 6.7% higher than in February 2013 (when the euro economy was still shrinking). The annual data also shows that building activity in Portugal and Italy has shrunk over the last 12 months, but has picked up strongly in Spain. Eurostat reported: The highest [annual]increases in production in construction were registered in Slovenia (+33.1%), Hungary (+28.3%), Spain (+23.9%), Poland (+14.4%) and Germany (+14.1%), and the largest decreases in Romania (-14.7%), Portugal (-11.5%) and Italy (-7.9%). While on a monthly basis.... The highest [monthly] increases in production in construction were observed in Poland (+17.4%), Hungary (+8.2%) and Spain (+3.0%), and the largest decreases in Slovenia (-4.9%), Italy (-3.7%) and the United Kingdom (-2.8%). Bank lending to UK businesses continues to shrink, despite efforts to drive credit to small firms. Mortgage lending, though, continues to rise -- which won't dent fears that Britain's economic recovery is based on the shifting sands of a housing boom. That's the message from the Bank of England's monthly \"Trends in Lending\" report, which states: The stock of lending both to small and medium-sized enterprises and to large businesses contracted over this period. Mortgage approvals by all UK-resident mortgage lenders for house purchase continued to rise, on average, in the three months to February. The annual rate of growth in the stock of secured lending to individuals rose to 1.1%. The annual rate of growth in the stock of consumer credit continued to be strong. The annual rate of growth in the stock of lending to UK businesses remained negative in the three months to February. Not a ringing endorsement of the BoE's Funding for Lending Scheme (which was recently revamped to remove support for mortgage lending), as economist Shaun Richards tweets: Dutch electronics firm Philips has seen 7.4%, or \u20ac1.7bn, wiped off its stock market value this morning after becoming the latest European firm to suffer from the strong euro. Philips suffered a 22% plunge in earnings in the first three months of 2014, to \u20ac314m, well shy of analyst forecasts of \u20ac341m. It warned that unfavourable exchange rates and slowing demand for medical equipment in China and Russia means 2014 will be \"challenging\". More here. The rally in pharmaceutical stocks has driven European stock markets higher, with the FTSE 100 jumping 53 points to 6679, a two-week high. The German DAX has jumped 1%, as the optimism created by M&amp;A activity ripples around. Ishaq Siddiqi, analyst at ETX Capital, says the GSK-Novartis deal is: Welcome news for Glaxo shareholders; the company managed to dispose of the oncology business which was suffering against the oncology units at global peers such as Roche and AstraZeneca. The combined consumer healthcare business controlled by GSK should also cheer investors given the current strength of Novartis\u2019s consumer healthcare portfolio. The prospect of a massive takeover bid ($100bn?!) for AstraZeneca continues to excite traders, even though the UK pharmaceutical firm resisted Pfizer's recent approach (here's our story from Sunday). With Astra's shares up 7.6%, the City reckons it could still be a takeover target, as Siddiqi explains: A combination of both companies would help with reducing huge costs \u2013 so although talks have ended for now, market participants are expecting AstraZeneca to now be in the spotlight as an attractive takeover candidate by not only Pfizer but other global pharma firms. Here's a handy explanation of the healthcare brands that will come together in Novartis and GSK's new consumer healthcare operation, from PA: The tie-up will create a world-leading business with annual revenues of around \u00a36.5 billion from Glaxo products such as Aquafresh and Beechams and antiseptic range Savlon and cough and cold brand Tixylix from Novartis. Glaxo's CEO, Andrew Witty, has suggested that today's deal with Novartis (details below) could lead to more jobs being created in the UK. He told my colleague Sarah Butler that there will be \"minimal impact\" to its workforce in the UK. Indeed, GSK plans to invest some of the deal's proceeds in research and development, potentially boosting employment within Britain. Here's a couple more snaps from the GSK conference call: GLAXOSMITHKLINE CEO SAYS NOVARTIS DEAL MAKES COMPANY \"BIG IN VACCINES, CONSUMER\" AND SOME AREAS OF PHARMA GSK CEO SAYS NOVARTIS DEAL IS RECOGNITION OF VALUE OF ONCOLOGY BUSINESS, NO CHANGE ON EARLY R&amp;D Shares in pharmaceutical firms have jumped in early trading in Europe. Investors are welcoming the Novartis-GSK deals, and the prospect of Pfizer launching a huge takeover bid for AstraZeneca -- whose shares are leading the London stock market. Here's the details: AstraZeneca: up 7.6%, gaining 284p to \u00a340.71. GSK: up 4.1%, gaining 65p at \u00a316.23 Novartis: up 2.75%, gaining 2.05 swiss francs to CHF76.75 And UK's drugs firm Shire is also sharing in the M&amp;A uplift: Shire: up 4.6%, gaining 136p to \u00a330.62 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and business. The City is gripped with merger and acquisition fever this morning, with a rash of deals and takeover activity in the pharmaceutical sector to excite investors as they return to their desks. Two major drugs companies, Switzerland's Novartis and the UK's GlaxoSmithKline, swept away any post-Easter cobwebs with a series of multi-billion deals this morning. Both companies' shares have jumped in early trading. The agreement is based around an asset swap -- Novartis pays up to $16bn for Glazo's oncology business, and sells its own vaccine business to GSK for up of $7.1bn. Both companies are then forming a new Consumer Healthcare business. The Swiss firm is also selling its animal health division to rival Eli Lily for $5.4bn, while Glaxo is planning to give \u00a34bn back to its shareholders. The tie-up comes just two days after news broke that America's drug giant Pfizer could be poised to swoop on Britain's AstraZeneca to create a new giant in the pharma sector. At perhaps \u00a360bn, such a deal could be the biggest takeover of a UK firm ever - although Astra is understood to be cool about the idea. So what's the motivation behind Novartis and GSK's big tie-up? The key, it seems, is to give Novartis a stronger position in the consumer healthcare sector, while GSK cements a stronger position in the vaccines business. In a world where ageing Western populations require more healthcare, but governments are trying to restrain spending, pharma firms are eager to establish a dominant position in key sectors. As Novartis CEO Joe Jimenez explained on Bloomberg TV this morning: I believe you'd better be number one, two or three in your sector, and this is what this deal is all about. A surge in M&amp;A activity is also going to calm fears that global stock markets are heading for a fall, I suspect. We'll have reaction to these deals shortly, along with other breaking news through the day...",

Of the 68,000 people directly employed by the sector in the UK, 23,000 are employed in highly skilled R&amp;D roles, according to figures from trade body the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI). \"The biggest contribution is how much the pharmaceutical industry spends on R&amp;D, and the proportion of skilled workers employed is clearly a large part of that as the UK builds up a pipeline of medicines and future drugs,\" said Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturing trade body EEF. As the government engages in a push for more exports, in a bid to rebalance the UK economy away from its reliance on credit-fuelled spending and financial services, the pharma industry is already a significant exporter to the European Union and beyond. It has consistently outperformed the overall economy in terms of trade, generating a surplus of about \u00a35bn a year over the past decade, according to the ABPI. In contrast, the UK's trade deficit for all goods and services was more than \u00a32bn a month on average in 2013. Pharmaceuticals account for 9% of UK manufacturing output and 10% of manufacturing exports. The UK pharma industry is facing challenges however, with increased competition from some of the world's fast growing emerging economies including China, Brazil and India. Between 2003 and 2007 the UK was fifth or sixth in the global pharmaceutical rankings, but has since slipped to 10th.",

Bank of England data showed that lending to companies of all sizes fell in the three months to February on a year earlier despite calls by chancellor George Osborne for businesses to boost growth by investing more. However, there was some let-up in the pace of the fall in lending. The BoE's trends in lending report showed a \u00a30.5bn drop in the three months to February after a \u00a33.3bn annual drop in the preceding three months. The Bank said lending was down 2.1% in February on a year earlier and that much of that weakness was down to the role played by real estate businesses, where a rise in repayments had cut net lending to the sector. Excluding the real estate sector, net lending to businesses was virtually unchanged on a year ago, the Bank added. BBA, the banking trade association, said that, although net lending was down, a high proportion of loans were being approved. \"As the economy picks up, businesses are building up record cash reserves and paying off more of their debt, leading to an overall decline in net lending. However ... new lending is picking up strongly,\" said Richard Woolhouse, the BBA's chief economist. \"Low interest rates mean that the cost of finance is at an historic low, creating good borrowing conditions for businesses seeking to grow. What's more, seven out of 10 applications for business finance are approved so there's rarely been a better time to approach your bank.\" The BoE's figures on lending to households showed mortgage approvals continued to rise in the three months to February and annual growth in the stock of mortgage lending accelerated in February. It stood at 1.1%, up from 1.0% in January. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight said that, despite a slight slowdown in mortgage approvals for February, when fewer sales could probably be attributed to flooding, underlying momentum appeared to be \"robust\". \"It is certainly justifiable to talk of a house price bubble in London \u2013 but the strength of house prices is not yet a serious problem outside of the capital and housing market activity is still not unduly strong compared to long-term norms so, in these respects, it is premature to talk of a general housing market bubble,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, the risk of an overall housing market bubble developing is very real as the strength in house prices is becoming more widespread.\" Unsecured borrowing by households, which includes the use of credit cards, continued to rise. It was up an annual 4.8% in February, unchanged from the growth seen in January.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's GlaxoSmithKline and Swiss rival Novartis have agreed a multibillion dollar swap of assets in a move that led to a rally in pharmaceutical stocks as investors bet on a renewed burst of dealmaking across the sector. The two drug companies will join forces in the consumer healthcare sector to combine brands including Aquafresh, Beechams and Tixylix, while exchanging their oncology and vaccine businesses. The deal comes amid a frenzy of takeover speculation in pharmaceuticals with the US drugs group Pfizer reportedly considering a $100bn (\u00a360bn) bid for Britain's AstraZeneca, while Canadian group Valeant Pharmaceuticals on Tuesday confirmed a $46.5bn move for Allergan, the California-based maker of Botox. Shares in GSK rose 5.2% to \u00a316.40 and Switzerland's Novartis rose 2% to 76.40 Swiss francs (\u00a351.28). AstraZeneca rose nearly 4.7% and the UK's Shire jumped 4% to \u00a330.60 on hopes of more deals to come, with the FTSE100 index climbing nearly 1%. GSK shareholders will benefit from a \u00a34bn capital return funded by net proceeds of $7.8bn from the Novartis deal, in which the Brentford-based firm is selling its oncology business to Novartis for $16bn and purchasing its new partner's vaccine business for an initial $5.25bn. A further $1.8bn is promised to Novartis if the vaccines division performs well. Novartis, meanwhile, is selling its animal health division to US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly for $5.4bn. Sir Andrew Witty, the GSK chief executive, said the complex deal had taken months to agree but was a step on from the mega-mergers of the past under which firms might gain two or three useful businesses alongside seven or eight unwanted elements which could distract attention from developing its core business. \"I believe if you really focus the transaction on just the things you really care about you can create tremendous value in that space,\" Witty said. \"Opportunities to build greater scale and combine high quality assets in vaccines and consumer healthcare are scarce. With this transaction we will substantially strengthen two of our core businesses and create significant new options to increase value for shareholders,\" he added. The combined consumer healthcare business will house 19 brands, including Panadol and Nicotinell, with sales of more than $10bn worldwide in what Witty described as a \"powerhouse in over-the-counter products\". Witty added that the deal strengthened GSK's global leadership in the vaccines market, increased its scale in consumer health products and would deliver immediate sales and earnings benefits once completed in early 2015. GSK will continue to develop experimental cancer treatments and could market these itself in future, although Novartis will have first refusal if it decides to seek a partnership with a third party. Savvas Neophytou, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, upgraded GSK to a buy as he said the deal was a sensible move away from \"white tablet\" pharmaceuticals and the lacklustre oncology business after a tricky few weeks for the company, which has been embroiled in corruption allegations. \"Today's transaction shows management will not sit idly by waiting for the pipeline to mature but will take brave decisions to unlock shareholder value,\" Neophytou wrote in a note. Tim Anderson, at Bernstein Research, said the acquisition of GSK's cancer division was good news for Novartis. \"It is odd to us that GSK would give up this business as oncology is a 'hot' therapeutic area and the company has had some pipeline successes,\" he said. Drugmakers are stocking up their oncology pipelines as they bet that combinations of drugs or drug cocktails will become the future of cancer care. A desire to boost its oncology business is seen as a key factor behind Pfizer's reported interest in AstraZeneca. Joseph Jimenez, chief executive of Novartis, said the agreements with GSK marked a \"transformational moment for Novartis. They focus the company on leading businesses with innovation power and global scale.\" He said profits would improve as it brought in the higher margin cancer treatments and sold off less profitable animal health and vaccines units. The transaction between the two major pharmaceutical companies will meanwhile lead to a cascade of smaller deals. GSK is to accelerate a review of its historic medicines business \u2013 which include drugs such as the antidepressant Seroxat and the prostate cancer drug Avodart \u2013 and investors should \"not be surprised if we are able to transact a disposal in the next year or two\". At the same time, Novartis said it would be seeking a buyer for its flu vaccine business which is not included in the wider vaccines deal with GSK. While the Novartis-GSK transactions will face scrutiny from competition watchdogs, Witty said he did not expect a \"substantial number of issues\", because the businesses were \"remarkably complementary\" both in geographic and product terms. The company expects to gain \u00a31bn in annual cost savings from the deal. Witty said there would be \"minimal impact\" to jobs in the UK and that new jobs in research and development could be created as the company expected to reinvest \u00a3200m of its savings in new research and development. Deal details \u2022 The Swiss company Novartis will buy Brentford-based GlaxoSmithKline's oncology arm for up to $16bn (\u00a39.5bn). \u2022 GSK will buy Novartis's vaccines business for up to $7.05bn. \u2022 Both companies will create a consumer healthcare division, which will include well-known brands such as Aquafresh, Beechams and cough mixture Tixylix. \u2022 GSK will return \u00a34bn to shareholders as part of the deal. \u2022 Novartis will sell its animal health arm to Eli Lilly of the US for $5.4bn.",

The news has sent its shares 17.3p lower to 127.4p.</p> <p>Analyst Andrew Darley at finnCap issued a sell note, saying:</p> <blockquote> Colt has announced a trading update dominated by the news that the culmination of the strategic review has led to the decision to undertake a planned reduction of 85% of the carrier voice business, in order to liberate capacity for more profitable enterprise business, leading to an estimated reduction in revenue of \u20ac175m (11% of former 2014 consensus, with roughly half of the reduction evident in 2014). <br> The change in business plan will accompany staff reductions, costing \u20ac30m, with savings effective in 2015.  [We reiterate our] sell recommendation...with the uncertainty of growth in the former business model being offered redemption by the strategic review, but still no need for investors to accept the risk with no certainty of improvement. Most upside remains from the unpredictable timing of the potential to be acquired while in a period of weakness and change, with Fidelity's 65% stake remaining the deciding factor. 100p target reiterated until our review of forecasts is completed. </blockquote> <p>Nomura said, in a note with a neutral rating:</p> <blockquote> We note that Colt claimed to have pioneered a state-of-the-art carrier voice trading platform, which would constitute a winning proposition in this segment and that the effective winding down of the platform amounts to another strategic misstep from the company (following the misstep in moving away from a co-location hosting model two years ago). <br> As a result, we expect several shareholders to be losing patience with Colt, and we expect continued weakness in the shares in the coming weeks. Colt is expected to provide a much-needed strategy update to investors and shareholders with the first half results or shortly after. Our forecasts are under review following today's profit warning. </blockquote>",

Analyst Andrew Darley at finnCap issued a sell note, saying: Colt has announced a trading update dominated by the news that the culmination of the strategic review has led to the decision to undertake a planned reduction of 85% of the carrier voice business, in order to liberate capacity for more profitable enterprise business, leading to an estimated reduction in revenue of \u20ac175m (11% of former 2014 consensus, with roughly half of the reduction evident in 2014). The change in business plan will accompany staff reductions, costing \u20ac30m, with savings effective in 2015. [We reiterate our] sell recommendation...with the uncertainty of growth in the former business model being offered redemption by the strategic review, but still no need for investors to accept the risk with no certainty of improvement. Most upside remains from the unpredictable timing of the potential to be acquired while in a period of weakness and change, with Fidelity's 65% stake remaining the deciding factor. 100p target reiterated until our review of forecasts is completed. Nomura said, in a note with a neutral rating: We note that Colt claimed to have pioneered a state-of-the-art carrier voice trading platform, which would constitute a winning proposition in this segment and that the effective winding down of the platform amounts to another strategic misstep from the company (following the misstep in moving away from a co-location hosting model two years ago). As a result, we expect several shareholders to be losing patience with Colt, and we expect continued weakness in the shares in the coming weeks. Colt is expected to provide a much-needed strategy update to investors and shareholders with the first half results or shortly after. Our forecasts are under review following today's profit warning.",
