      "bodyText": "Often when we hear talk of cultural wars, it\u2019s about political correctness and a desire to glorify some skewed vision of western civilisation. But the real war to change our culture and society is being waged on the economic front \u2013 especially on the issue of taxation. And the result of the current debate over the government\u2019s income tax plan could fundamentally alter the way our society operates. Pretty much all you need to know about our economy at the moment is that in the past 12 months, Australia\u2019s GDP has grown by 3.1% in real terms \u2013 the best growth for nearly two years; at the same time, the average compensation per employee has grown at a slower rate than inflation. Wages growth has been putrid for so long now that previous record-low growth levels are considered an improvement, and any previous normal growth is decried as extreme. \u2022 Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday This week, the national minimum wage was raised by 3.5% \u2013 a figure that the budget predicts will be the average for all workers from 2020-21. And yet the announcement was met with cries of horror from business groups \u2013 the Australian Industry Group\u2019s chief executive, Innes Willox, suggested it had the potential \u201cto be a major disincentive to employment\u201d. It was a nice reminder that the chief feature of the past seven years \u2013 household income at best flat and according to some measures, falling \u2013 is one that business groups and the government are very happy to continue. And how do you maintain that? One way is to ensure labour has little power to bargain for better outcomes. This week, the ABS reported that in the first three months of the year there were fewer strikes than had occurred in any three-month period in our history. Just 18 industrial disputes began and only 23 took place during the March quarter \u2013 breaking the records set in the first quarter under WorkChoices back in June 2006. Going on strike now involves such an inordinately complex regulatory process as to make it out of bounds for most workers. Red-tape hating conservative governments oddly love regulations that restrict the ability of workers to organise and attempt to get getter pay. On this score, the conservatives have largely won their cultural war \u2013 nearly four decades of vilifying unions and legislating to weaken them has left a situation where the ability to collectively bargain has been neutered and real wages growth is seen as an extravagance. The next battle is on tax where the government is doing its best to destroy the social contract that has bound us since the second world war. The attack on progressive taxation was put forward with the most delightful stupidity by the Institute for Public Affairs this week. In its submission to the Senate economic committee\u2019s review of the personal income tax plan, it argued that progressive taxation \u201cdiscriminates against Australians by income. Other forms of discrimination, such as by skin colour, race, or ethnicity, are rightly abhorred, yet the income tax system openly discriminates against people by income\u201d. Yes, discriminated high-income earners. Someone should organise a telethon. Malcolm Turnbull may not put forward his views in such an idiotic manner, but his views are certainly in concert with the IPA. This week, he boasted that should his government\u2019s tax plan to remove the 37% tax bracket go through, it would result in people earning between $41,000 and $200,000 paying the same tax rate of 32.5%. And while his own government\u2019s figures show this move will benefit only those earning above $120,000, he continues to falsely suggest that the policy is about combating bracket creep. We know it is false because his own suggestion of what bracket creep is betrays his real target. He asked in his news conference: \u201chow many times have we heard over the years \u2013 people say bracket creep is a real disincentive for people getting ahead? For getting another job, for taking a promotion, for working overtime?\u201d Firstly, the answer is no one has ever said that \u2013 at least not anyone who understands how income tax works \u2013 and secondly what our prime minister is describing is not bracket creep, but progressive taxation. Bracket creep is when you work in the same job and get a pay rise that moves you into a higher marginal tax bracket \u2013 or even if you stay in the same tax bracket but your average rate of taxation goes up. What Turnbull is decrying is a world where people on higher paying jobs face a higher level of taxation. Bracket creep is mostly an issue at the bottom end of the income scale and the real disincentive to work is not moving into a higher tax bracket but the drawdown of government benefits as a result of earning a higher amount, and such things as HECS/HELP and the Medicare levy. None of this is addressed by getting rid of the 37% tax bracket. What it does do is give a tax cut to those earning more than $120,000; it also reduces the overall amount of revenue. The Parliamentary Budget Office calculated this week that the removal of the 37% tax bracket and increasing the top tax threshold from $180,000 to $200,000 would cost an average of $8.3bn a year from 2024-25 to 2028-29. Throw in the cost of the company tax cuts, and we\u2019re talking about massive cuts in government spending to pay for them. But this is not a nasty side effect \u2013 it is an intrinsic part of the plan \u2013 less tax paid by the rich, and less money spent on public services and benefits. This is the real cultural war \u2013 and because of the virtual impossibility of rescinding tax cuts once legislated, losing the battle over tax may mean losing the war.",

      "bodyText": "Ten years after the financial crash, most Britons remain suspicious of calls to be adventurous with public money. Aware that the pre-2008 economy was akin to a high-wire act, they believe lapsing back into the old borrow-to-spend routine will only herald another disaster. That\u2019s why the chancellor, Philip Hammond, feels secure when he bats away calls to throw off his self-imposed straitjacket and lift austerity. And it\u2019s the reason Bank of England governor Mark Carney tells us in his speeches that he\u2019s tied the hands of bank bosses and that their institutions are safer than at any time in a generation. That safety-first attitude can be seen in the referendum vote this weekend in Switzerland. The ballot paper asks voters if they want to adopt a system of money backed by the central bank rather than the current crop of high street banks. It would take all the excitement out of the banking world, stripping it of the red braces and spivvy attitudes that caused so much grief. Under the plan, an enlarged central bank would guarantee the deposits held in accounts for all individuals and businesses. The private banks would be allowed to manage these accounts, probably for a fee, and run investment accounts on the side. Only the investment funds would be at risk, though a compensation scheme might apply. What is trickier to ascertain is how such a plan would provide loans to businesses and individuals. In an era when so many things are bought with credit, the implications are huge. Almost 90% of cars are bought with credit. Most furniture is bought with borrowed money, as are, obviously, most homes. Britain\u2019s banking sector, with at least part of its gambling streak intact, is in the vanguard of offering 40-year mortgages and loans with repayments that stretch well into retirement. The Swiss plan allows private banks to offer loans, though only from their deposits or what they can get from money markets or the central bank. They cannot create money as they do now, putting the central bank in a position of sanctioning all other lending. And a good thing too, you might say. No longer would the taxpayer be forced to rescue banks and their customers. Lending should be safe and sustainable. Set aside the concerns about an overbearing central bank, and you have a system that neuters much of the wizardry bankers have become famous for. And yet the Swiss are expected to vote the proposal down. That is partly because there is so little flesh on the bones of the plan that it looks like a leap in the dark \u2013 especially when the framework brought in by Carney and friends goes a long way to achieving the same aim. But more importantly, there is a lack of trust in the state to work efficiently and effectively in the interests of the people. It might seem incredible after the financial horrors created by the banks, but people \u2013 and especially those with money \u2013 still prefer bankers to politicians. Those in favour of the Swiss vote believe central bankers can bridge the credibility gap. In addition, a regime of sound money would restrict the funds going into property and foster support for more productive areas of the economy. But in Britain, like it or not, the economy is driven by consumer spending and fuelled by debt. Worse, much of this spending is based on buying and selling homes. And when it comes to investments, the preference is for get-rich-quick schemes that base their returns on paying little or no tax. Sustainability gets a back seat. The revelation last week that Scotland\u2019s public sector pensions have invested heavily in private finance initiative schemes run by companies based in offshore tax havens is just the tip of the iceberg. There is little appetite for investing in dull sectors like manufacturing, which offer the prospect of big risks for modest returns. A new system of money won\u2019t change that. If there were an appetite for it, leftwing parties across Europe would be higher in the polls rather than falling apart at the seams. Even the mildest suggestions in the UK for public investment beyond transport are likely to be ignored by ministers when the polls clearly show most voters don\u2019t trust them to spend wisely. For that reason, plans for a revolution in the financial system, even one to make it safer, spark fear and anxiety. That doesn\u2019t mean the state is powerless to win back support for public investment. It does mean that change can only arrive incrementally and from the bottom up. The new combined local authorities in Manchester and Birmingham are on the frontline. They at least have a little money to spend. If they can revive a sense of civic pride with developments that show a high degree of respect for their constituents, then there is a chance to reverse public attitudes.",

      "bodyText": "For hundreds of thousands of commuters, a rail timetable change will never seem innocuous again. Before the schedules were switched three weeks ago, plenty of people had predicted teething troubles: train companies had spoken of the logistical challenge ahead, and commuters were told to expect some initial disruption. At the time, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), a key commuter franchise that runs a sprawling array of routes from Brighton through London to Luton and beyond, seemed to have put recent problems behind it. There had been warning signs on Northern, which covers cities including Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle. But still, the sheer scale of cancellations, delays, confusion and misinformation that arrived with the new timetable came as a shock. One rail grandee had predicted problems. But Sir Michael Holden, a former boss of East Coast, said the chaos had surprised him. \u201cNever in my worst nightmares did I imagine it could conceivably be anything like as bad as it is,\u201d he said. Nigel Harris, editor of trade magazine Rail, said it was \u201cthe most chaotic, fundamental and humiliating failure it has been my misfortune to witness in 40 years as a rail journalist\u201d. What had been billed as a boost to services instead saw thousands cancelled: plummeting punctuality statistics for GTR and Northern masked even greater local problems. In some peak periods on the Manchester-Preston line, or on Thameslink mainline trains, two in three trains were failing to run at all. Instead of a few days of hiccups, it swiftly became clear weeks of convulsions were ahead, with emergency timetables being introduced to slash services and stem the chaos. Around 8,000 services on GTR have so far been cancelled or severely delayed, while some 5,000 Northern trains have suffered the same fate since 20 May \u2013 excluding two days of strikes when 2,000 trains were pulled in advance. As the cumulative fury of commuters swells into a political crisis, how did this self-inflicted disaster come about? Why was the timetable changed so radically? This blow to the reputation of England\u2019s railways came, ironically, at what should have been a moment of triumph. Instead of the usual twice-yearly tweaks, the national timetable was to undergo wholesale revisions to take advantage of new technology, new trains and years of engineering work. The Great North Rail project, which included electrification and the construction of a new piece of track, the Ordsall Chord, was designed to allow more trains to travel through Manchester, speed up journeys and make new direct links possible. In the south, commuters were set to reap the fruits of a project so long in the gestation it was once called Thameslink 2000: a \u00a37bn overhaul that included rebuilding London Bridge station, adding modern signalling and buying new trains so that dozens of services could pass per hour with automated, Tube-style frequency. Every single train timing was redrawn on GTR\u2019s franchise in an attempt to harvest the benefits of that work, add extra services and \u2013 laughable though it sounds now \u2013 increase reliability. Why did it go wrong? The fundamental problem was the lack of drivers. Both GTR and the company that operates Northern\u2019s franchise, Arriva Rail North, claim to be employing more than enough drivers to run the expanded services the May timetable was due to provide. However, what is needed on every train is a driver who has been trained both on the exact model of train and the full route they are to operate. That takes time and resources: new drivers are trained by qualified drivers, taking them out of the action too and compounding the shortage. That, of course, is foreseeable \u2013 which is why services have to be planned many months in advance. Normally, the process of setting timetables starts 16 months ahead, to be thrashed out by train companies and approved by Network Rail \u2013 the state-owned operator of Britain\u2019s rail infrastructure \u2013 with three to six months to spare. This time, it was a matter of weeks. Why were the timetables drawn up so late? There is no single answer, though there are interconnecting issues from north to south. For Northern, Network Rail accepts a large part of the blame for a long-delayed infrastructure upgrade \u2013 the electrification of the line past Bolton. Work that should have been long finished has dragged on: a first contractor was replaced by Carillion \u2013 but then Carillion imploded. And Carillion\u2019s replacement has had to grapple with ground scarred by old mines, taking weeks to put up power lines that would normally go in overnight. But Northern has also struggled with industrial relations: goodwill, which has often buoyed up an industry reliant on overtime and rest-day working, has evaporated in parts. All retraining has had to take place on working days, leading to an acute shortage of trained drivers even before the May changeover. GTR, meanwhile, had been through well-documented problems of its own, with strikes by guards and drivers heaping on commuter despair. The Southern part of the franchise has been a byword for rail failure since 2015 (although right now, almost unnoticed, it is thriving since the timetable change). A set of interrelated problems, on track and trains, had been identified by Chris Gibb, the senior railwayman brought in by transport secretary Chris Grayling to help restore some quality to GTR in December 2016. He warned that a phased introduction of new services would be vital to make Thameslink work. That view was shared by Network Rail and GTR: but delaying new services needed the Department for Transport\u2019s approval \u2013 which came long after Network Rail planners needed to start drawing up the timetable. When the DfT belatedly decided phasing was a good idea, the planners\u2019 work was scrapped and the process started again, four months late already. And yet more issues arose: GTR\u2019s planning team, shorn of numerous experienced staff, requested thousands of changes months later. What questions remain? Two inquiries lie ahead: one commissioned by Grayling from Professor Stephen Glaister, chair of the Office of Rail and Road regulator; and an investigation by the transport select committee. The latter may yet bring the axe hovering closer over Grayling\u2019s head. The transport secretary has angered Network Rail by immediately blaming them. Then in his statement to the Commons, he claimed he had been \u201cpersonally assured\u201d by GTR that the service would work, and risked alienating allies such as Gibb, who chaired the Thameslink readiness board, by joking about trusting experts. Grayling\u2019s claim of receiving assurances could yet be called into question by GTR executives. Conversely, should GTR prove to have not informed the readiness board that they did not have sufficient drivers, it calls into question the competence of a company supposedly intensely monitored by the DfT. And Network Rail, as a publicly owned company, reports to the transport secretary \u2013 the one accountable person, as Labour points out, in a fragmented industry. Would nationalisation or a single owner have averted it? Possibly, yes: even leaving aside questions of state versus private, a single accountable body with proper oversight might have acted sooner. In Scotland, where track and train come under joint supervision, the late delivery of Hitachi trains prompted Scotrail to defer its own new timetable. This was a course of action that England\u2019s fragmented system was apparently unable to take. A senior industry source said: \u201cIt\u2019s a system issue \u2013 you\u2019ve got to get all the elements right. We\u2019ve bitten off more than we could chew. We knew that it was going to be the biggest timetable change ever, and the industry didn\u2019t spend enough time checking it would work \u2013 until it was too late.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u201cDarlington used to be like Harrogate years ago,\u201d says 65-year-old Jenny McGee, as she comes out of Binns, an art deco department store at one end of Darlington town centre. \u201cPeople used to tell me about how all the women here wore these nice hats and coats with gloves. It was a smart place.\u201d The Tees Valley market town found out this week that Binns, bought by House of Fraser in the 1950s, is to close, along with 31 other HoF department stores around the country. McGee, who used to run a hair salon, says she is devastated by the news. \u201cI come here about twice a week. It\u2019s a lovely place to meet people and go for a coffee,\u201d she says. House of Fraser\u2019s announcement on Thursday that it would shut more than half of its UK stores, came after Marks &amp; Spencer said last month that it was planning to close 100 stores, among them its shop in Darlington. The two stores sit at either end of the town\u2019s main shopping thoroughfare, with its range of handsome historic buildings. Once a major shopping centre for people from surrounding villages, in recent years the town centre has lost a British Home Stores, a TK Maxx, a McDonald\u2019s and a Starbucks, leaving it with more than its fair share of discount stores, charity shops and empty units. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably just board Binns up like they did with British Home Stores and it\u2019ll make the town look so poor, which it isn\u2019t,\u201d says McGee. Chris McEwan, cabinet member for economy and regeneration on Darlington borough council, says the closure of the two stores was, in some ways, inevitable, but that a \u201ccruel twist of fate\u201d brought the announcements in such quick succession. \u201cI think these companies have made a strategic directional change and they\u2019re saying, \u2018We\u2019re smelling the coffee and we want to get out of medium-sized towns\u2019,\u201d he says. For Rachel Anderson, head of policy and representation at North East Chamber of Commerce, shopping centres like Darlington\u2019s should be thriving. \u201cIf you look at the figures for the Tees Valley, by far the most affluent boroughs are Stockton and Darlington,\u201d she says. \u201cDarlington has pockets of deprivation, but its proximity to the east coast mainline, the airport and the A1 means there is relatively low unemployment and some high-quality jobs. It is really quite affluent.\u201d Like many towns of a similar size, says Anderson, it has suffered from \u201cleakage\u201d \u2013 shoppers being pulled away from town centres to places like shopping malls \u2013 Teeside Park, a retail and leisure development in Thornaby-on-Tees, is about a 25-minute drive away. Jonathan Liddle\u2019s family have been running a fish stall in Darlington\u2019s covered market \u2013 which stands opposite Binns \u2013 since 1970. He recognises that the closure of Binns will bring difficulties, but says he is trying to keep his \u201cchin up and mind open\u201d to the new trends in how people shop. \u201cPeople like coming here,\u201d he says, after greeting a customer by his first name. \u201cBut people\u2019s lives have changed so much. The mums and dads both work and they\u2019re very busy and they do need to do their shopping at Aldi at 8pm,\u201d he says. \u201cThe traditional older shopper still comes to us, and the younger shopper loves to come to us \u2013 but only when they have time.\u201d Robin Blair is vice-chair of Darlington retail market stalls association, as well as the proprietor of JJ Blair and Sons, a grocer and smallholder that has traded from the market hall for 140 years of its 150-year existence. He refuses to believe that the closure of Binns could signal the end for Darlington high street. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work harder and to provide a different sort of service. But the market hall would be empty if people didn\u2019t want it and it isn\u2019t empty,\u201d he says, gesturing to his busy stall.\u201d New plans for the market hall involve creating more eating and drinking areas, and spaces for musical performances. \u201cMarkets and town centres are important to the social side to life. As you can see, we\u2019re not dead,\u201d says Blair. \u201cWe save the NHS a lot of money. People come here to shop and have a chat and, when they go away, they\u2019re not depressed.\u201d McEwan agrees that there needs to be what Anderson describes as \u201ca reassessment of what the town centre is for\u201d. He insists that the council has been trying to prepare for the flight of the big chains by deploying \u201coperational tactical interventions\u201d \u2013 like arranging Christmas markets and street theatre \u2013 designed to give people more reasons to travel into town. \u201cBut there\u2019s only so much you can do when you\u2019ve had \u00a350m taken off you by central government,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make a political point. It\u2019s just how it is.\u201d He says the council is going to have to think radically about what to do with the Binns building \u2013 which underwent a \u00a32m refurbishment as recently as 2016 \u2013 as it is not going to be easy to find a company to take on such a large space. \u201cIt is the biggest unit in the town, so we cannot stand by and allow it to be boarded up and look like crap. We just can\u2019t \u2013 morally or economically,\u201d says McEwan. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to think of ways of intervening. I just don\u2019t know what it is at the moment.\u201d Local Labour MP Jenny Chapman says that in the light of the departure of big high street brands, the town needs to focus on nurturing its independent businesses \u2013 of which there are a comparatively high number. She points to the area around Grange Road, just around the corner from Binns, which boasts smart delis, cafes, a gin bar and upmarket hairdressers. \u201cThis is going to be tough, it really, really is,\u201d she says of the impending store closures. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t build something good from this. You\u2019ve got to be optimistic or you will fail. I believe that Darlington can be a thriving town centre, but the offer is changing whether we like that or not. \u201cIt\u2019s happening, so let\u2019s try and make it change for the better.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cDarlington used to be like Harrogate years ago,\u201d says 65-year-old Jenny McGee, as she comes out of Binns, an art deco department store at one end of Darlington town centre. \u201cPeople used to tell me about how all the women here wore these nice hats and coats with gloves. It was a smart place.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Tees Valley market town found out this week that Binns, bought by House of Fraser in the 1950s, is to close, along with 31 other HoF department stores around the country. McGee, who used to run a hair salon, says she is devastated by the news. \u201cI come here about twice a week. It\u2019s a lovely place to meet people and go for a coffee,\u201d she says.</p> <p>House of Fraser\u2019s announcement on Thursday that it would shut more than half of its UK stores, came after Marks &amp; Spencer said last month that it was planning to close 100 stores, among them its shop in Darlington. The two stores sit at either end of the town\u2019s main shopping thoroughfare, with its range of handsome historic buildings. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/07/high-street-woes-a-list-of-lost-shops-and-jobs\">High street 2018: a tale of lost shops and at least 35,000 jobs at risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once a major shopping centre for people from surrounding villages, in recent years the town centre has lost a British Home Stores, a TK Maxx, a McDonald\u2019s and a Starbucks, leaving it with more than its fair share of discount stores, charity shops and empty units. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably just board Binns up like they did with British Home Stores and it\u2019ll make the town look so poor, which it isn\u2019t,\u201d says McGee. </p> <p>Chris McEwan, cabinet member for economy and regeneration on Darlington borough council, says the closure of the two stores was, in some ways, inevitable, but that a \u201ccruel twist of fate\u201d brought the announcements in such quick succession. \u201cI think these companies have made a strategic directional change and they\u2019re saying, \u2018We\u2019re smelling the coffee and we want to get out of medium-sized towns\u2019,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/06/darlington_shops/giv-3902VKUD4fnpvll8/\" data-alt=\"Darlington high street graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/06/darlington_shops/giv-3902VKUD4fnpvll8/\">Darlington high street graphic</a> <figcaption>Darlington high street graphic</figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Rachel Anderson, head of policy and representation at North East Chamber of Commerce, shopping centres like Darlington\u2019s should be thriving. \u201cIf you look at the figures for the Tees Valley, by far the most affluent boroughs are Stockton and Darlington,\u201d she says. </p> <p>\u201cDarlington has pockets of deprivation, but its proximity to the east coast mainline, the airport and the A1 means there is relatively low unemployment and some high-quality jobs. It is really quite affluent.\u201d</p> <p>Like many towns of a similar size, says Anderson, it has suffered from \u201cleakage\u201d \u2013 shoppers being pulled away from town centres to places like shopping malls \u2013 Teeside Park, a retail and leisure development in Thornaby-on-Tees, is about a 25-minute drive away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fb06e6ad035c9838cc1a46ea932afebbe75bb0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fb06e6ad035c9838cc1a46ea932afebbe75bb0f/0_206_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Set to close: Binns department store in Darlington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Landmark store Binns, at one end of the high street, is set to close.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jonathan Liddle\u2019s family have been running a fish stall in Darlington\u2019s covered market \u2013 which stands opposite Binns \u2013 since 1970. He recognises that the closure of Binns will bring difficulties, but says he is trying to keep his \u201cchin up and mind open\u201d to the new trends in how people shop. </p> <p>\u201cPeople like coming here,\u201d he says, after greeting a customer by his first name. \u201cBut people\u2019s lives have changed so much. The mums and dads both work and they\u2019re very busy and they do need to do their shopping at Aldi at 8pm,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe traditional older shopper still comes to us, and the younger shopper loves to come to us \u2013 but only when they have time.\u201d</p> <p>Robin Blair is vice-chair of Darlington retail market stalls association, as well as the proprietor of JJ Blair and Sons, a grocer and smallholder that has traded from the market hall for 140 years of its 150-year existence. He refuses to believe that the closure of Binns could signal the end for Darlington high street. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work harder and to provide a different sort of service. But the market hall would be empty if people didn\u2019t want it and it isn\u2019t empty,\u201d he says, gesturing to his busy stall.\u201d New plans for the market hall involve creating more eating and drinking areas, and spaces for musical performances. </p> <p>\u201cMarkets and town centres are important to the social side to life. As you can see, we\u2019re not dead,\u201d says Blair. \u201cWe save the NHS a lot of money. People come here to shop and have a chat and, when they go away, they\u2019re not depressed.\u201d</p> <p>McEwan agrees that there needs to be what Anderson describes as \u201ca reassessment of what the town centre is for\u201d. He insists that the council has been trying to prepare for the flight of the big chains by deploying \u201coperational tactical interventions\u201d \u2013 like arranging Christmas markets and street theatre \u2013 designed to give people more reasons to travel into town. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19cda855b72be965bcf1e7c01f4869b62d9955af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19cda855b72be965bcf1e7c01f4869b62d9955af/0_440_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Darlington high street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With low unemployment and high-quality jobs Darlington is described as \u2018quite affluent\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut there\u2019s only so much you can do when you\u2019ve had \u00a350m taken off you by central government,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make a political point. It\u2019s just how it is.\u201d</p> <p>He says the council is going to have to think radically about what to do with the Binns building \u2013 which underwent a \u00a32m refurbishment as recently as 2016 \u2013 as it is not going to be easy to find a company to take on such a large space.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the biggest unit in the town, so we cannot stand by and allow it to be boarded up and look like crap. We just can\u2019t \u2013 morally or economically,\u201d says McEwan. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to think of ways of intervening. I just don\u2019t know what it is at the moment.\u201d </p> <p>Local Labour MP Jenny Chapman says that in the light of the departure of big high street brands, the town needs to focus on nurturing its independent businesses \u2013 of which there are a comparatively high number. She points to the area around Grange Road, just around the corner from Binns, which boasts smart delis, cafes, a gin bar and upmarket hairdressers.</p> <p>\u201cThis is going to be tough, it really, really is,\u201d she says of the impending store closures. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t build something good from this. You\u2019ve got to be optimistic or you will fail. I believe that Darlington can be a thriving town centre, but the offer is changing whether we like that or not. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s happening, so let\u2019s try and make it change for the better.\u201d<br></p>",
