      "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of people will get government help to buy a new home, in a plan to reignite the property market and trigger a construction boom. The chancellor set out in his budget plans for interest-free loans and guarantees to support \u00a3130bn worth of new mortgages from 2014. The surprise announcement sent shares in housebuilders soaring, but sparked fears of a new house price bubble and drew comparisons with the failed state-sponsored US mortgage corporations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Critics said that George Osborne was falling back on the housing market to lift the economy after failing to boost manufacturing and business. Aimed at middle- and lower-income workers who are being priced out of the housing market by the large deposits required by lenders, Help to Buy will allow people to obtain a 20% interest-free loan from the government, as long as they put down a 5% deposit and buy a newly-built property. The government also launched a \u00a312bn guarantee scheme, starting in January 2014, that will support anyone buying a home up to the value of \u00a3600,000. Osborne hopes to reverse the dramatic decline in home ownership, from a high of 71% in 2003 to 65% now, and boost the construction industry. Mortgage lending has also flagged, with figures on Wednesday revealing an 8% slump in new home loans in February compared with January. The scale of the government's intervention startled the property industry and delighted developers. The guarantee scheme will support mortgages together worth \u00a3130bn \u2013 not far short of the \u00a3140bn lent in 2012, although the scheme will be spread over three years. Up to 300,000 households will benefit. Within minutes of the budget announcement, shares in Barratt Developments jumped 7% and Persimmon rose 5%. Linden Homes, one of the five biggest developers in the UK, said it \"warmly welcomed\" the package of measures, \"which now open up the options for even more people to get on the ladder, or make that all-important next step up.\" But there are fears that taxpayers' cash will be squandered in renewed house price inflation. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned: \"Government need to be careful this doesn't create another housing bubble \u2013 pushing prices up at the expense of buyers.\" Nick Pearce of the thinktank IPPR said: \"It continues a strategy based on propping up \u2013 indeed inflating \u2013 prices rather than getting additional homes built. This suggests that the lessons from the housing bubble that contributed to the financial crisis have not been learnt and that orthodox thinking on housing policy remains entrenched in Whitehall.\" Priced Out, the group that campaigns on behalf of \"Generation Rent\" \u2013 those shut out of the property market by high prices \u2013 said Help to Buy \"should be called 'Help to Developers'\". Spokesman Duncan Stott said: \"It means a massive bung of taxpayers' money to developers. It will mean more debt pumped into our overpriced housing market and will keep house prices out of reach of first-time buyers.\" When the 20% interest-free loans become available on 1 April, they are likely to spark a scramble among first-time buyers. The government has set aside \u00a33.5bn to underwrite the loans, which will typically mean that a buyer receives an interest-free amount of around \u00a350,000, saving nearly \u00a3300 per month in repayments. The government says the scheme will remain open for three years, but demand will almost certainly outstrip supply. It is expected that the \u00a33.5bn will help around 74,000 more homebuyers on to the ladder, but unless the scheme is replenished with more government cash, buyers at the back of the queue may lose out. The announcement goes some way to answering the concerns raised by Vince Cable in a recent New Statesman article in which the business secretary called for an increase in borrowing to revive housebuilding. Cable regards the chancellor's announcement as a step in the right direction, though he believes it will mainly boost residential, rather than social, housing. He will also be looking carefully to see whether the announcements help boost the construction sector. Ed Balls welcomed the announcement but said it amounted to little after the fall in the building of affordable housing: The shadow chancellor said: \"There has been a big hit to housebuilding, including affordable housebuilding, over the last couple of years because of the scale of the cut in the government's investment going into affordable housing. We have seen an 11% fall in housing starts. It is not only about public spending. More broadly, the state of the economy means that private developers are not building affordable homes. \"We are pleased they have done something around housing and housing starts. But it is tiny numbers compared to the scale of the challenge in terms of getting housebuilding moving.\" The shadow chancellor questioned the \"big guarantee\" for first mortgages. He said that the \u00a31.5bn a year for the Help to Buy scheme and the Build to Rent scheme were listed in the budget red book as \"below the line\", meaning they are not recording in government borrowing. Balls said: \"These are not counted in government borrowing. These are all below the line because essentially it is an off-budget transaction because it is a government guarantee which doesn't go into the borrowing numbers. I am not necessarily against these kind of things. But I thought George Osborne was.\" Mortgage lenders are now hurriedly working out how the guarantee scheme will affect the availability and pricing of home loans. The idea is that the government will underwrite the portion of a mortgage between 80% and 95% of the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of a property, making it less risky for banks and building societies to offer buyers a loan. That should also enable lenders to narrow the gulf between the pricing of high-LTV mortgages, where interest rates are typically 4% to 5%, and the 2.5% to 3% paid by people able to put down deposits of 40% or more. Lenders remain guarded in their response until more details emerge about how much they will have to pay to access the scheme. \"We don't yet know the size of the commercial fee that lenders will have to pay,\" said Sue Anderson of the Council of Mortgage Lenders. But Lloyds Banking Group, which includes Halifax and is Britain's biggest lender, said: \"We believe that the mortgage guarantee scheme will give a much needed boost to the housing market and most importantly address the issue of accessibility. Crucially, this scheme will not only help first-time buyers but also second-steppers, a key segment of the housing market that is also in need of more support and attention.\" How builders respond to the measures will be a key test of their success. Housebuilding, currently running at around 90,000 completions a year, fell 9% in 2012 compared to the previous year, and the depressed construction industry has been a key factor contributing to sluggish economic growth. Lucian Cook, housing market researcher for Savills, said the introduction of interest-free loans \"could deliver a 28% increase in newbuild sales if it is fully taken up\". But he warned that building activity still remains woefully short of the amount that Britain needs to cope with increasing demand and a growing population: \"We expect the schemes to give a boost to housebuilding, although we still forecast levels of construction well below the 230,000 new homes needed a year.\"",

      "bodyText": "We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage of Fun with the Fed. Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 The Federal Reserve announced it would continue to buy assets in an attempt to encourage lending, at the current rate of $85bn a month. That's $40bn in mortgage-backed securities and $45bn in Treasury bills. \u2022 The Fed did not announce a change to interest rates and in fact extended the prospective time frame to \"2015 or 2016\" for keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. \u2022 Markets showed lively spark upon the announcement. \u2022 Bernanke said, \"I don't think too big to fail is solved now.\" He said new capital and liquidity rules for large banks would help fix the problem. \u2022 Bernanke said the labor market shows signs of improvement, the unemployment rate remains elevated, household spending and business investment are up advanced and the housing sector improved. \u2022 Bernanke said that when the Fed decides to stop buying assets it will do so gradually. He did not mention a date for when acquisitions would begin to taper. \u2022 Bernanke said he doesn't have any news on whether or when he might retire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped nearly 100 points from 14,455 to 14,541 with the Fed's announcement of continued bond purchases. At 20 minutes to close the index is ticking down a bit. Last question: Given the unprecedented nature of Fed policy under your watch, do you feel responsible for seeing the policies through, and \"to what extent do you feel personally responsible to be at the helm\"? Second part, last time we did this you said you had not discussed retirement with the president. \"Could you tell us if you've had that conversation?\" \"I've spoken with the president a bit, but I don't really have any information for you at this juncture,\" Bernanke says. \"I don't think I'm the only person in the world who can manage the exit... I tried to depersonalize to some extent monetary policy and financial policy. \"This is an extraordinary institution... There's no single person who is essential to that. \"With respect to my personal plans, I will certainly let you know when I have something more concrete.\" Bernanke is done. The National Journal brings up 1999 and 2002 speeches in which Bernanke said monetary policy isn't a good way to deal with market bubbles. Does he still believe that? \"Monetary policy is a very blunt instrument,\" Bernanke says. \"If you're raising interest rates to pop an asset bubble... you might at the same time send the economy into recession, which kind of defeats the purpose.\" But \"I think that given the problems that we've had... that we need to at least take into account these issues as we make monetary policy. What that means depends on the circumstances.\" \"I have an open mind on this question. We're learning. All central bankers are learning,\" he says. Two questions: If a run on the banks happens in Cyprus, how will that affect US markets? And could central bankers in the US take deposits from citizens' accounts as proposed (and rejected) in Cyprus? \"Cyprus is a tiny economy, and I don't think that these issues... have a direct implications for the US economy,\" Bernanke says. In terms of the US, \"no one's ever lost a dime\" since the FDIC was founded in 1934, he says. \"I consider that to be extremely unlikely in the United States,\" he says. Bernanke is bearish on Cyprus, which rejected a big bailout proposed by the EU this week: \"Finding the resources to solve Cyprus' problem - there's probably no easy way to do it. I don't envy them that.\" Ryan Avent of The Economist: Is there any feeling that perhaps the recovery has not been going fast enough? Is there enough cushion between the Fed rate and the zero lower bound (meaning zero)? \"I'm not sure I understand the whole thrust of your questions,\" Bernanke says. Then he digs into the question of whether rates are too low, stuck near 0 with nowhere to go. \"As a lot of academic research shows... telling the markets you're going to stay low\" is a good way to bring long-term rates down and encourage borrowing, Bernanke says. As for the pace of recovery, Bernanke defends the Fed strategy, but says \"We don't have enough firepower to get the economy back to full employment quickly.\" \"We define price stability as 2% inflation. Not 0%. Because if you have 0 inflation you're very close to the deflation zone and nominal rates would be so low there's no flexibility.\" How often do you tend to hit zero lower bound? It's apparently more common than previously thought, Bernanke says. There's a disconnect between the unemployment rate and economic growth, Bernanke says. At points the jobless rate has fallen noticeably while growth lags. He see \"improvement in the outlook\" of the jobs market as a result of the quantitative easing program. \"Normally you would need to see a reasonable pace in GDP growth in order to see that,\" he says. In short, growth and unemployment should move together and if they don't that will be weird and we will study it. Fox News question: How about that stock market? We're on fire! \"We're not measuring success in terms of the stock market,\" Bernanke says. \"We're measuring success in terms of our mandate, which is stable employment and [inflation control].\" And leave it to a central banker to pour cold water on hot market news: \"While the Dow may be hitting a high, it's in nominal terms, not in real terms.\" Bernanke talks about too big to fail, the trap by which taxpayers are stuck with bailing out reckless big banks whose collapse would threaten the entire economy. He says there will be surcharges on the largest banks. Large banks will have to hold more capital as a proportion of investment, he says. He talks about liquidity regulation. \"We will put forward restrictions on how much liquidity risks firms can take.\" \"I don't think too big to fail is solved now.\" NYT Binyamin Appelbaum question: \"When was the last time you spoke with someone who was unemployed?\" Bernanke manages a compassionate answer: \"Pretty recently. I have a relative who is unemployed. I come from a small town in South Carolina that has taken a big hit... the home I was raised in had just been foreclosed upon when I was there. \"I have great concern for the unemployed, [for themselves and for the loss of skills and labor]. Question: Are you going to retire next year or what? \"I don't have anything for you,\" Bernanke says. As for term limits, \"the president always has the option to re-appoint or not re-appoint, and the Senate always has the option to re-confirm or not.\" The Guardian's Dominic Rushe notes that \"all the US stock markets are rising as Ben speaks.\" Investors are clearly happy that Fed has left the spigot on and it doesn't sound like it has any imminent plans to turn it off. The Dow is now at 14535.61, up +79.79. \"Obviously there has been improvement\" in the job market, Bernanke says. We are saying improvement. But they want to make sure it is not only a temporary improvement, as has happened. Bernanke says tapering asset acquisition is important, so as not to provoke market backlash. \"The problem with having just a single criterion is that it's all or nothing.\" Going full speed ahead and then hitting the wall would jar markets, Bernanke says. What does Bernanke mean by \"substantial improvement\"?: \"A broad-based improvement in a range of indicators,\" he says. So that clears that up. When will the tapering begin? Steve Liesman of CNBC asks. \"At each meeting we'll try to determine whether there's been a sufficient change,\" Bernanke says. \"We'll use models and other indicators.\" The committee expects a gap between the end of quantitative easing/ asset purchases and the beginning of rate elevation, Bernanke says. He did mention 2016 as a possible time frame for boosting rates. Under any scenario could asset purchasing last nearly so wrong? Bernanke's taking questions now. He's asked about the lack of thresholds that would trigger quantitative easing. Given the complexity of the issue, he says, \"to this point we've not been able to give quantitative thresholds for the asset purchases. As we make progress... we may adjust the flow rate of our purchases month-to-month.\" Fourteen of the 19 FOMC participants saw the first increase in the target rate \"as occurring in 2015 or 2016,\" Bernanke says. Bernanke says labor markets are improving and housing is stronger. From the committee statement: Labor market conditions have shown signs of improvement in recent months but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive. Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Most participants see inflation growing, reaching 1.7-2.0% in 2015. \"We are continuing the asset purchase program first announced in September,\" Bernanke says. \"Most participants agreed that these purchases... continue to provide meaningful growth to economic growth and job creation.\" He refers to the risks of expanding the Fed balance sheet and keeping rates low. Consistently low rates could prompt some actors to over-borrow and create a debt hazard, he says. But the committee agreed this risk is manageable. As for the pace of Fed asset acquisition, a picture says it all: Bernanke is speaking. He says the fourth quarter pause in recovery was \"temporary\" and \"moderate economic growth\" has resumed. Parsing the Fed statement: Quantitative easing will continue at $85bn per month. From the Fed press release: To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Fed foresees \"a return to moderate economic growth following a pause late last year.\" \"The unemployment rate remains elevated. \"Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\" The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent... Interest rates unchanged; bond-buying program to continue. It's the news everyone expected. The Fed press release is here. Bernanke knows message control: The Fed chair scheduled his news conference on a tighter turnaround than usual today to get ahead of statements by committee members, Bloomberg reports: Ben S. Bernanke is tightening his control of Federal Reserve communications to ensure investors hear his pro-stimulus message over the cacophony of more hawkish views from regional bank presidents. The Fed chairman, starting tomorrow, will cut the time between the release of post-meeting statements by the Federal Open Market Committee and his news briefings, giving investors less opportunity to misperceive the Fed\u2019s intent. \"The big question,\" writes Ylan Q Mui over on Wonkblog, \"is whether Fed officials can get it right after years in which they have regularly predicted a stronger economy than the one that materialized.\" In January 2011,Fed officials predicted that GDP would grow around 3.7 percent that year. It clocked in at 2 percent. In January 2012, they anticipated growth of about 2.5 percent. We ended up with 1.6 percent. Getting the forecasts right this time will be especially tricky: The economy came to a standstill at the end of last year, but job growth has picked up faster than expected. Lawmakers backed away from the fiscal cliff at the end of 2012 but couldn\u2019t escape sequestration. How much coal to shovel into the furnace? CNBC's 54 survey respondents \"believe the Fed will purchase $917 billion of additional assets this year in its open QE program, up from $858 billion in January.\" That's about $76bn monthly, a downshift from the current $85bn. Welcome to our live blog coverage of action \u2013 no, let's capitalize that \u2013 Action over at the Federal Reserve, where open market committee members have been meeting for the last two days to decide which chins to tickle to make the economy purr. Their fearless leader, Ben Bernanke, is about to emerge from behind the green curtain and announce what they decided. Everyone else, even Ron Paul, will simply have to live with it. A CNBC survey of 54 economists, analysts and money managers predicted that the Fed will leave interest rates alone but step up purchases of bonds and mortgage-backed securities.

The Fed's program to purchase assets, known as quantitative easing, has been controversial, with critics saying the $85bn in monthly acquisitions is intrusive and courts inflation. While Bernanke favors further quantitative easing, leaked minutes from the Fed's December meeting showed several members wanted to end to easing by the end of 2013. Such a move would likely decrease bank lending and could hamper economic recovery. We'll know shortly how that timeline is shaping up.",

The challenge will be to bring the Russians to the table and get them to share the burden.</p> <p>Having displayed the stick (deposit levy) to get Russia to the table, the most obvious next step would be to dangle some carrots (such as offshore drilling rights) to facilitate a solution. This is not without precedent, as part of the Greek bailout programme included asset sales/privatisation.</p> <p>The challenge is that this needs to be completed today, or authorities need to extend the bank holiday. With this in mind, it seems to me the Russians have a bit of an advantage in the negotiation. The only real pressure the troika could exert would be to cut off funding for the Cyprus central bank, which is reliant on the emergency liquidity assistance scheme (ELA). This would potentially raise the cost to Russia for not stepping in.</p> <p>What are the near-term implications for asset markets? We have seen the euro push to recent lows, Spanish and Italian stocks sell off and yields on their government bonds rise (prices fall). Further downside from here requires a policy error, which though not impossible, I would be hesitant to suggest is the base-case scenario. Like flare-ups in the eurozone before, I believe a face-saving agreement will be found. It\u2019s not likely to solve the broader crisis, but once again kick the can a bit further down the road.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51498ffc95cbaf64024f63d9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-20T10:31:24.995Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">No ECB liquidity without bailout, says Bank's Asmussen</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The statement from the European Central Bank following the Cyprus parliament's rejection last night of a savings levy was not exactly clear about what it meant.</p> <p>The ECB reaffirmed \"its commitment to provide liquidity as needed within the existing rules\", but at Swordfish Research's Gary Jenkins said <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/20/eurozone-crisis-live-cyprus-new-bailout-russia#block-514970e395cbaf64024f63ba\">earlier</a>, these rules seem to be made up as they go along.</p> <p>Now come some newspaper comments from ECB board member Joerg Asmussen, from Die Zeit via Reuters.</p> <p>Asmussen said Cyprus's banks were not solvent unless they were recapitalised quickly, and the ECB can only provide liquidity to solvent banks.

Here's Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On Monday I said that I wouldn\u2019t vote for the Cyprus bailout as initially proposed (at least I wouldn\u2019t do so and remain in the country) and even though the proposal was amended to exempt all deposits under \u20ac20,000 it did not receive a single vote in favour. The ECB responded by confirming its commitment \u2018to provide liquidity as needed within the existing rules,\u2019 which of course they tend to make up as they go along. The Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden said that it was necessary that Eurozone finance ministers meet \u2018as soon as possible\u2019 to negotiate a new rescue package. One could argue that as they were the lot who negotiated the last one that maybe they should try and find someone else to do it for them.</p> <p>He went on to say that: \u2018What matters now is to undertake all necessary measures to ensure the stability of the Eurozone.\u2019 Maybe they could think about some kind of deposit guarantee scheme, or even a banking union? Oh, wait a minute\u2026</p> <p>In an alternative universe the initial deal did protect all deposits under \u20ac100K, the bailout has been agreed and all is well with the (alternative) world. (By the way, Wales won the 6 Nations in this universe as well\u2026).</p> <p>But in this universe they have opened Pandora\u2019s Box and we now know that deposit guarantee schemes are potentially worthless. Now here I must stop myself for a minute because of course such schemes are only of value when the sovereign is independently solvent. It\u2019s not as if some friendly civil servant cycles up to your door the next morning with a suitcase containing your cash.</p> <p>So what happens next? There are a myriad of potential outcomes which range from Cyprus raising money from elsewhere (Russia being the hot favourite), a renegotiation of the terms with the Eurozone all the way to a disorderly default and an exit from the Euro.

      "bodyText": "European markets have mainly closed higher despite the continuing uncertainty in Cyprus, a notable exception being the UK market in the wake of chancellor George Osborne's Budget. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 0.13% lower at 6432.70 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.68% \u2022 France's Cac climbed 1.5% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB rose 2.2% \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 1.15% higher \u2022 In Athens the market added 0.79% In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.4% higher ahead of the outcome of the latest Federal Reserve meeting and chairman Ben Bernanke's press conference. So with Cyprus's future still uncertain for the moment, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. The Troika is expected to reject Cyprus's new plan, according to the Wall Street Journal: International creditors were set to reject an alternative bailout plan Cyprus cobbled together a day after the government's divisive tax on bank deposits died a quick death, two officials with knowledge of the situation said on Wednesday. Experts from the troika\u2014the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund\u2014were briefed Wednesday on Nicosia's Plan B to secure a \u20ac10 billion ($12.93 billion) bailout after Parliament resoundingly rejected the deposit-levy plan attached to the original agreement. Cypriot authorities proposed turning pension-fund assets into government bonds in a bid to raise about \u20ac4.2 billion of the \u20ac5.8 billion the deposit tax would have raised. But troika officials weren't convinced this would be a viable option, the officials said. While the plan would bring money into state coffers, it would be in the form of debt, making the country's already heavy load unsustainable, they said. Full story here. And so it moves on to tomorrow: The ratings agencies of course will be watching the Cyprus situation very carefully: Meanwhile this looks like it's confirmed: Update: It now seems the banks will be closed on both Thursday and Friday. So with the (scheduled) bank holiday on Monday we're looking at them now not reopening until Tuesday. As many had suspected would happen... The president of the European parliament does not seem to keen on Russian involvement in a Cyprus rescue: Funny how the blame game continues.... Speaking of which, Bloomberg has a piece here on that very subject. The Cyprus cabinet are reportedly to discuss capital controls, presumably to prevent money flooding out of the country when the banks do re-open. And on that subject, it seems likely they will remain closed until at least the end of the week. (And with Monday being a bank holiday, possibly longer). One of the suggested outcomes of Cyprus's attempts to solve its current crisis involved Russia receiving gas assets in exchange for financial help. But Vincent Forest, Cyprus analyst attThe Economist Intelligence Unit, said this was a risky idea: Betting on Cypriot gas is very risky, as the precise volumes are still unknown and the geopolitical tensions around the fields are very high. Furthermore, exploiting such gas fields takes at least seven to ten years. Any deal involving this gas would therefore imply a very high level of trust over a long period of time. The present crisis surely undermined such a prospect. Its nice to have a bit of optimism, and here it comes from Greece, of all places. Greece's finance minister Yannis Stournaras said the country is shielded from the fallout of the Cyprus crisis, according to Reuters. And there are apparently banks in the country interested in taking over the Greek units of Cypriot banks. The \"shielded\" comment is a little ironic, given that Cyprus's banks ran into trouble thanks to the haircuts investors had to take on their holdings of Greek bonds. Here's an interesting chart breaking down Cyprus bank deposits: More speculation: Interesting piece here from Euromoney earlier this month, talking about the prospect of depositors in Cyprus taking a hit, and the possibility of capital flight to avoid this... Eurozone consumer confidence edged up in March, it appears. The European Commission said the index improved to -23.5 from -23.6 in February. Still negative though, and presumably taken before the latest blow-up in Cyprus. Bit more detail from Dow Jones on what Cyprus plan might involve: Of course, if previous reports are true, the troika wants nothing to do with the proposals. But this alternative plan may not pass muster: If the Cyprus/Russia talks have ended for the day without resolution, there could still be some action on the island itself. AP reports: A Cypriot financial official said authorities were working on bills which would need parliamentary approval aiming to limit the amount of money leaving the country, and that a decision would be announced later on how long the banks would remain closed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release the information. A government official said an alternative plan to raise the \u20ac5.8bn [orginally to have come from bank savings] had been drafted and was to be presented to the troika, most likely on Wednesday. The plan would raise money from domestic sources, including pension plans and subsidiaries of foreign banks active in Cyprus. One of those domestic sources may be the country's influential Orthodox church. Its head, Archbishop Chrysostomos II, said he would put the church's assets at the country's disposal, saying the church was willing to mortgage its assets to invest in government bonds. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy is speaking at the European parliament: Another direct consequence, along with shut banks and queues for ATMs, of Cyprus's financial crisis: Pimco's Bill Gross, who runs the world's largest bond fund, is far from impressed with what has been happening with the Cyprus bailout: Cyprus finance minister Michalis Sarris has admitted there were no concrete offers from Russia after his first day of talks in Moscow, but plans to stay until a deal is done. Miriam Elder, the Guardian's Moscow correspondent, writes: Sarris met his Russian counterpart, Anton Siluanov, before holding higher-level talks with Igor Shuvalov, a deputy prime minister and close ally of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. The talks ended at about 4pm Moscow time and Sarris cancelled a planned press conference because of the lack of results. Cyprus turned to Russia for a lifeline, seeking a five-year extension on a \u20ac2.5bn loan granted in December 2011 that is due to mature in 2016. It has also asked Russia to refinance the loan and lend an additional \u20ac5bn. \"We had a very good first meeting, very constructive, very honest discussion,\" Sarris said after meeting Siluanov. \"We've underscored how difficult the situation is.\" However, he said there were \"no offers, nothing concrete\". Sarris said he would stay in Moscow until a deal was reached. \"We'll now continue our discussion to find the solution by which we hope we will be getting some support,\" he said. Asked by reporters whether that meant simply renegotiating a loan, Sarris said: \"No, we are looking at things beyond that.\" Full story here. There is much agreement that the Cyprus situation needs to be resolved quickly. But perhaps there are different definitions of \"quickly.\" Some would take that to indicate today or maybe tomorrow. But perhaps not: Because last weekend's agreement worked out so well... More from ECB board member Joerg Asmussen who warned about the (lack of) solvency of Cypriot banks earlier. Speaking at conference he said abandoning the tough reforms and raising spending instead would not solve the debt crisis and would merely shift the problems to the future. He said: It is an illusion to think that more debt is the answer to this debt crisis. Recent research has shown that high public debt levels in the euro area hamper growth, with a serious negative effect starting when debt exceeds 90% of GDP. Here's a handy Reuters roundup of Cyprus developments so far today: Cyprus pleaded for a new loan from Russia on Wednesday to avert a financial meltdown, after the island's parliament rejected the terms of a bailout from the EU, raising the risk of default and a bank crash. Cypriot Finance Minister Michael Sarris said he had not reached a deal at a first meeting with his Russian counterpart Anton Siluanov in Moscow, but talks there would continue. Russia's finance ministry said Nicosia had sought a further \u20ac5bn, on top of a five-year extension and lower interest on an existing \u20ac2.5bn loan. Cyprus is seeking Moscow's help after parliament voted down the euro zone's plan for a \u20ac10bn bailout on Tuesday. Cypriots balked at EU demands for a levy on bank deposits to raise \u20ac5.8bn, an unprecedented measure that opponents said would have violated the principle behind an EU-wide guarantee on deposits of up to \u20ac100,000. Moscow has its own interests in ensuring the survival of banks in Cyprus, a haven for billions of euros squirreled abroad by Russian businesses and individuals. The European Central Bank's chief negotiator on Cyprus, Joerg Asmussen, said the ECB would have to pull the plug on Cypriot banks unless the country took a bailout quickly. \"We can provide emergency liquidity only to solvent banks and... the solvency of Cypriot banks cannot be assumed if an aid program is not agreed on soon, which would allow for a quick recapitalization of the banking sector,\" Asmussen told German weekly Die Zeit in an interview conducted on Tuesday evening. Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said he could not rule out Cyprus leaving the eurozone, although he hoped its leaders would find a solution for it to stay. Full story here. ...this may not be completely implausible. Away from Cyprus and indeed the UK Budget, it seems French authorities have searched the Paris flat of IMF boss Christine Lagarde. The move is part of an investigation into her handling of a 2008 compensation payment of \u20ac285m to businessman Bernard Tapie. There are claims that Lagarde, then finance minister, acted illegally in approving the payment. She denies any wrongdoing. A reminder that our live coverage of the UK Budget - George Osborne is now speaking - is here. As mentioned BTL, there are reports that Cyprus Popular Bank has been sold to Russian investors, something which has gave a lift to markets and the euro. However, in this atmosphere of speculation and rumour, it may not be correct: David Cameron repeated his promise that any Briton in Cyprus sent by the government (foreign office, ministry of defence etc) would not lose out in terms of their savings. Nor would they be short of cash, thanks to the plane full of euros sent out to the island, he said at prime minister's question time in response to Labour leader Ed Milliband. As for the many thousands of British citizens in Cyprus, he said the government could not insure them against any losses in their Cyprus bandk accounts. But they would get the benefits and payments they were entitled to. Asked how much the UK government knew and when, Cameron pointed out that the UK was not involved in the bailout discussions since it was not in the euro. Nor would it be contributing up to \u00a31bn which it would otherwise have been liable to. On the issue of bank trust - potentially damaged by any raid on savings - Cameron said: We made it very clear to Cyprus... when you have a deposit protection scheme...[it] should be respected. There's a bit of the blame game going on, it would appear. The European Commission has said the weekend deal was unanimous and it felt it had to support the proposals even though it did not agree with all aspects of them (which, I do wonder? Could it be the hit to smaller depositors?) Meanwhile there was this reported from the French: Meanwhile EC vice president Olli Rehn will apparently not join President Jose Manuel Barroso's mission to Russia but will instead stay in Brussels to deal with the Cyprus problem. Reports are emerging that the talks between Cyprus and Russia have ended without a deal, and will continue tomorrow. On the other hand: It's not just a gas deal Russia wants apparently: Spain is likely to change its economic forecasts, prime minister Mariano Rajoy said earlier. In his weekly appearance in parliament he said (quotes from Reuters): International organisations have changed their forecasts on a number of occasions and there are factors that, no doubt, will oblige us to do that... I believe we will change our forecasts. The current prediction is for a 0.5% contraction in GDP but analysts believe this could be revised to 1.5% in April when Spain gives its new forecasts to Brussels. A host of speculation is emerging about what Cyprus might actually plan in plan B: Meanwhile: And: Staying with Germany, the country earlier sold \u20ac3.3bn of 10 year government bonds. No surprise there was strong demand, given events elsewhere. The sale attracted 1.6 times the amount on offer, up from 1.2 times at a similar sale in February. The average yield was 1.36%, the lowest at a 10 year auction since July 2012. Meanwhile in Portugal, the country sold \u20ac1.5bn of Treasury bills, including \u20ac1.2bn of 18 month bills. The yield on these fell to 1.506% from 1.963% at a similar sale in January. Yields on the remaining \u20ac300m of three month bills edged up from 0.737% in February to 0.757%. So not a bad result all round, under the circumstances. Angela Merkel regrets the outcome of last night's vote in the Cypriot parliament, according to snaps on Reuters. But the German chancellor accepts the decision and now awaits a proposal from the Cypriot government to the Troika. She will look at all the proposals the government makes. Hammering home the point made by the ECB earlier, she said Cyprus does not have a sustainable banking sector. Savers in Cyprus with more than \u20ac100,000 in the bank should be ready to contribute to any bailout (it was the plan to hit savers with more than \u20ac20,000 that scuppered the vote). No real surprise, I suppose, if true: More thoughts on Russia's possible involvement in easing Cyprus's financial woes. Norman Villamin, chief investment officer for Europe at Coutts said: Russia, with probably the greatest direct economic interest and social and historical connection to the island, is at this point a passive participant in plan to save Cyprus. The challenge will be to bring the Russians to the table and get them to share the burden. Having displayed the stick (deposit levy) to get Russia to the table, the most obvious next step would be to dangle some carrots (such as offshore drilling rights) to facilitate a solution. This is not without precedent, as part of the Greek bailout programme included asset sales/privatisation. The challenge is that this needs to be completed today, or authorities need to extend the bank holiday. With this in mind, it seems to me the Russians have a bit of an advantage in the negotiation. The only real pressure the troika could exert would be to cut off funding for the Cyprus central bank, which is reliant on the emergency liquidity assistance scheme (ELA). This would potentially raise the cost to Russia for not stepping in. What are the near-term implications for asset markets? We have seen the euro push to recent lows, Spanish and Italian stocks sell off and yields on their government bonds rise (prices fall). Further downside from here requires a policy error, which though not impossible, I would be hesitant to suggest is the base-case scenario. Like flare-ups in the eurozone before, I believe a face-saving agreement will be found. It\u2019s not likely to solve the broader crisis, but once again kick the can a bit further down the road. The statement from the European Central Bank following the Cyprus parliament's rejection last night of a savings levy was not exactly clear about what it meant. The ECB reaffirmed \"its commitment to provide liquidity as needed within the existing rules\", but at Swordfish Research's Gary Jenkins said earlier, these rules seem to be made up as they go along. Now come some newspaper comments from ECB board member Joerg Asmussen, from Die Zeit via Reuters. Asmussen said Cyprus's banks were not solvent unless they were recapitalised quickly, and the ECB can only provide liquidity to solvent banks. He said: We did not threaten (to cut off liquidity), but just pointed out as a matter of fact that we can provide emergency liquidity only to solvent banks and that the solvency of Cypriot banks cannot be assumed if an aid programme is not agreed on soon, which would allow for a quick recapitalisation of the banking sector. He was also quoted as saying that no other country in the eurozone had a banking sector crisis comparable to Cyprus. Germany's Green party is not happy at the idea of Russia helping to prop up Cyprus. According to Reuters, co-chair of the Greens Cem Oezdemir told German radio: I would probably not have voted 'no' if I'd been in the southern Cypriot parliament because of the possible consequences and because I don't think Cyprus should align itself with Russia. We know this is not just about Russian money but Russia's geostrategic interest in the island. It can't be in the interests of Europe for it to have a foot in the door of an EU member state and thereby have an influence on the expansion of the European Union. Oezdemir, of Turkish extraction, is clearly worried about the outlook for Turkey's membership of the EU. He has proposed making a bailout for Cyprus conditional on reviving talks about reunification of the island, which has been divided since 1974. More on Cyprus's Plan B discussions, courtesy of AP: Government spokesman Christos Stylianides says a meeting was under way at the central bank to discuss a 'Plan B' for raising funds, but also for reducing the \u20ac5.8bn that must be found domestically. Central Bank deputy governor Spyros Stavrinakis says no decision had been taken on when banks, which have been shut since the weekend, would reopen. The new plan being worked on Wednesday has not yet been presented to the EU and International Monetary Fund, he said. Here's some video from yesterday's vote in Cyprus and the subsequent celebrations, as well as the church's offer to support president Nicos Anastasiades. Breaking news: Members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee voted 9-0 to keep interest rates on hold. They also voted 6-3 against more quantitative easing, with Mervyn King, Paul Fisher and David Miles wanting a further \u00a325bn to take the total to \u00a3400bn. Meanwhile UK unemployment figures showed a 1,500 fall in the claimant count to 1.542m, the lowest since June 2011. But the fall was less than the 5,000 drop expected by economists. The jobless rate was steady at 7.8% For those interested in the UK chancellor's set piece, my colleagues Graeme Wearden and Andrew Sparrow are providing full coverage of the budget on a live blog here. Time for a quick look at the markets, and the mood seems fairly calm so far. Ahead of UK unemployment and Bank of England minutes, not to mention the budget, the FTSE 100 is up 0.32% at 6463. Germany's Dax is up 0.55% while France's Cac has climbed 0.6% and Italy's FTSE MIB has added 0.44%. Spain's Ibex is up 0.51%, while Athens is effectively unchanged. And here comes Plan B...whatever that might turn out to be. Russia's role in the Cypriot financial crisis is one of the more intriguing aspects of the whole situation. With some \u20ac20bn of Russian money estimated to be in Cyprus bank accounts, you can see why Russia was unhappy about the prospect of any levy on deposits. But quite how the country will assist Cyprus is still unclear. Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said: There were several reports that Cyprus was trying to get financial support from Russia. Other options could be the increase of other taxes or privatisations. A combination of several options has recently been proposed by Russian energy giant Gazprom which according to media reports has offered Cyprus a plan in which the company will undertake the restructuring of the country\u2019s banks in exchange for exploration rights for natural gas in Cyprus. Clearly an option with far-reaching geopolitical consequences. Cyprus's finance minister Michalis Sarris has said there has been no decision on a loan from Moscow yet but talks are continuing, according to Reuters. Last night an idea circulating was that Russia would help out financially in return for some of the island's energy rights. Meanwhile Austrian finance minister Maria Fekter said the European Central Bank would not provide liquidity indefinitely to Cypriot banks. The banks, currently closed, are dependent on emergency funding from the ECB and last night it said: The ECB takes note of the decision of the Cypriot parliament and is in contact with its troika partners The ECB reaffirms its commitment to provide liquidity as needed within the existing rules. But Fekter told reporters (quotes from Reuters): [If Cyprus does not come up with a new plan] then the banks won't open on Friday because the ECB will not provide any more liquidity. That is a more horrible scenario than what is on the table now. We will certainly help out the Cypriots but only under conditions that make sense. Certainly neither the ESM [bailout fund] nor the ECB can allow a bottomless pit. From the profane to the sacred. It seems everyone is pitching in to help Cyprus out of its crisis, with the church now offering its worldly goods. According to an AP report: The head of Cyprus' influential Orthodox church, Archbishop Chrysostomos II, says he will put the church's assets at the country's disposal to help pull it out of a financial crisis, after lawmakers rejected a plan to seize up to 10%t of people's bank deposits to secure an international bailout. Speaking after meeting President Nicos Anastasiades on Wednesday, Chrysostomos said the church was willing to mortgage its assets to invest in government bonds. The church has considerable wealth, including property, stakes in a bank and a brewery. Tuesday's rejection of the deposit tax has left the future of the country's international bailout in question. And here's Michael Hewson at CMC Markets: The Cypriot MP\u2019s obviously didn\u2019t get the EU memo that states that you must vote yes, and if you don\u2019t, you keep voting until you do. The saga has now moved onto the next stage of what is turning into a high stakes game of Russian roulette, quite literally, as the Cypriot finance minister Sarris flies off to Moscow in the hope of some better terms, perhaps in exchange for gas exploration rights and future revenues given the fairly sizeable amount of Russian money (about \u20ac20bn) frozen in Cyprus\u2019s banks. All the while Cyprus banks remain closed, probably until next week, while contingency plans for capital controls are being prepared for when they re-open to prevent a haemorrhaging of cash in the event a deal is done. As things stand a deal with Russia may be the most likely option for Cyprus, unless the EU blinks and softens the terms of the deal, which could be a tough sell for the German parliament in particular in an election year. In the absence of a deal a number of Cyprus MP\u2019s have said they will leave the euro. The unprecedented attempt to seize savers' cash as part of the bailout of Cyprus and the subsequent failure to get it through parliament has caused much comment. Here's Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research: On Monday I said that I wouldn\u2019t vote for the Cyprus bailout as initially proposed (at least I wouldn\u2019t do so and remain in the country) and even though the proposal was amended to exempt all deposits under \u20ac20,000 it did not receive a single vote in favour. The ECB responded by confirming its commitment \u2018to provide liquidity as needed within the existing rules,\u2019 which of course they tend to make up as they go along. The Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden said that it was necessary that Eurozone finance ministers meet \u2018as soon as possible\u2019 to negotiate a new rescue package. One could argue that as they were the lot who negotiated the last one that maybe they should try and find someone else to do it for them. He went on to say that: \u2018What matters now is to undertake all necessary measures to ensure the stability of the Eurozone.\u2019 Maybe they could think about some kind of deposit guarantee scheme, or even a banking union? Oh, wait a minute\u2026 In an alternative universe the initial deal did protect all deposits under \u20ac100K, the bailout has been agreed and all is well with the (alternative) world. (By the way, Wales won the 6 Nations in this universe as well\u2026). But in this universe they have opened Pandora\u2019s Box and we now know that deposit guarantee schemes are potentially worthless. Now here I must stop myself for a minute because of course such schemes are only of value when the sovereign is independently solvent. It\u2019s not as if some friendly civil servant cycles up to your door the next morning with a suitcase containing your cash. So what happens next? There are a myriad of potential outcomes which range from Cyprus raising money from elsewhere (Russia being the hot favourite), a renegotiation of the terms with the Eurozone all the way to a disorderly default and an exit from the Euro. At this stage any renegotiation would probably only be at the margins. Maybe the eurozone would make up the difference to allow deposits of, say under \u20ac50K to be protected. From a Eurozone perspective a default and an exit would lead to some immediate volatility and some doubts about the solidity of the eurozone. Ironically however the biggest risk to the eurozone would probably be the medium term one of the \u2018new\u2019 Cyprus recovering economic wise quicker than the stressed countries remaining in the eurozone. Aside from the many meetings in and concerning Cyprus, here are some of the other things to look out for today: 9.00 Eurozone current account 9:30 UK Bank of England Minutes 9.30 UK average earnings 9:30 UK unemployment 10:30 Germany to Sell \u20ac4bn 10-Year Notes 10:30 Portugal Holds Auctions for Three-, 18-Month Bills 10:30 Portugal to Sell 546-Day Bills 10:30 Portugal to Sell 91-Day Bills 12.30 UK Budget 15:00 Eurozone consumer confidence 18:00 US Federal Reserve rate decision and economic projections 18:30 Fed's Bernanke Holds Press Conference in Washington Good morning and welcome back to our rolling coverage of the latest developments from Cyprus and the rest of the eurozone and beyond. The Mediterranean island is in the spotlight after Tuesday's rejection by its parliament of the controversial levy on savers' deposits. Finance minister Michalis Sarris - who tendered his resignation only to have it rejected by the island's president Nicos Anastasiades - is in Russia for talks to drum up financial help. It has asked Russia for a five year extension of an existing loan of \u20ac2.5bn and a reduction in the 4.5% interest rate. Sarris told reporters in Moscow, according to Reuters: We're hoping for a good outcome but we cannot really predict. The president, who let's not forget is barely a month into the job, is holding a meeting with party leaders and the governor of the central bank. He is also due to hold a cabinet meeting as well as talks with officials from the Troika - the EU, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. The country is desperately trying to fill a \u20ac5.8bn gap now the savings levy has been voted down. Banks remain closed, but may or may not open on Thursday. There have been suggestions that - given next Monday is a bank holiday - things may remain closed until at least next Tuesday. Details of yesterday's developments are in our story here. Meanwhile there is a busy day ahead elsewhere, not least for the UK with the Bank of England minutes, unemployment and the Chancellor's setpiece, the Budget.",

The number of people out of work nudged up 7,000 to 2.52 million in the three months to the end of January, according to official figures. The surprise fall came despite a jump in the number of people in employment. According to official figures a steady rise in employment over the past 18 months continued after 131,000 people gained a job in the three months. Worringly for the Treasury, which is concerned about a lack of consumer demand, wages continued a recent fall, indicating that while more people are entering the job market, take-home pay has not increased. The Office for National Statistics said average weekly earnings growth including bonuses slowed to 1.2% in the three months through January, undershooting forecasts for a 1.5% rise. Adding to the gloom, the politically sensitive number of young people without a job ticked up to 993,000 in the three months to January, taking the unemployment rate for 16 to 24-year-olds to 21.2%. The unemployment update came as other data showed that mortgage lending declined by 8% to \u00a310.5bn in February, although it was 1% ahead of the levels recorded a year earlier. The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which collects the data and whose members account for 95% of all UK residential mortgage lending, said the housing market remained subdued. Meanwhile, in minutes released on Wednesday, Bank of England officials appeared to set aside the weakening jobs market in their March meeting after six of the nine-strong monetary policy committee voted against easing policy earlier this month. The governor of the Bank of England and chair of the MPC was outvoted for the second month, as rival members said mixed messages from the economy and the prospect of further falls in the value of sterling deterred them from voting with him. As in the February meeting, Sir Mervyn King was joined by central bank official Paul Fisher and City economist David Miles, an external member, in voting for a \u00a325bn boost to the current stock of government debt bought by the bank through its policy of quantitative easing (QE). The employment figures contained some good news for Osborne ahead of his fourth budget \u2013 with the unemployment claimant count declining by 1,500. Much of the recent falls in jobseeker's allowance claims are credited to a tougher stance by job centres, which are under pressure from ministers to cut off benefit payments when claimants fail strict guidelines on finding work. Employment is also 590,000 higher than a year ago, which economists have struggled to explain during a period when the UK suffered a double-dip recession. The chancellor will also find cheer in figures showing total public-sector employment fell at the end of last year for the 13th quarter in a row, dropping to 5.722 million \u2013 the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2001, the ONS said. Between December 2011 and December 2012, the number of people employed in the public sector fell by 313,000 and the number of people employed in the private sector increased by 904,000, though these figures are distorted by almost 200,000 further education and sixth form college lecturers and teachers who are now counted as private-sector workers.",
