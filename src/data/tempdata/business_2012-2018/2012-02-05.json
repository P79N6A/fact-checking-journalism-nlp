    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Financial markets have had a rip-roaring start to 2012. Fire-fighting by the European Central Bank (ECB) has eased fears that the eurozone will slide into a severe recession this year. Upbeat surveys of both the manufacturing and service sectors suggest that the UK should return to growth in the first quarter of 2012, weather permitting. Three pieces of upbeat news that should, in normal circumstances, guarantee that the Bank of England would leave monetary policy on hold this week and may even mull the possibility of tightening at some point later in the year. This, though, is not what the City expects. As far as the markets are concerned it is not a question this week of whether the monetary policy committee (MPC) embarks on a third round of money creation under the quantitative easing (QE) process, but rather how big the boost will be. The betting is on a \u00a350bn injection, which would take the total to \u00a3325bn. The fact that the Bank is even considering a further easing of policy is testimony to the profound weakness of the UK economy. For the past three years, bank rate has been 0.5% \u2013 comfortably the lowest level on record \u2013 and despite the pain being felt by savers there is no sign of it going up any time soon. The Bank has bought up some 20% of the gilts market already in an attempt to boost the money supply. Meanwhile, the Treasury has borrowed \u00a3500bn since the economy went into recession in early 2008. Even so, the level of national output is still 4% below where it was at the peak of the economic cycle and at the current rate of progress will take until the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the first world war before regaining the lost ground. Those seven lost years will have cost the UK economy around \u00a3200bn in output. The argument that this unprecedented policy response from the Bank and the Treasury has had little traction on the economy is valid, but misses the point: namely that without the easing of both monetary- and fiscal-policy activity the economy would have been substantially weaker and unemployment markedly higher. Is there, though, now a case for saying that enough is enough? Since the departure of Andrew Sentance last year, the MPC has lacked a voice favouring a tightening of monetary policy, but it is worth rehearsing what that case would be. Firstly, the Bank's job is to hit the government's 2% inflation target, yet the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index has been 4% or higher for the past year. Secondly, prices tend to be \"stickier\" in the UK than in other developed countries, so there is no guarantee that inflation will come down as quickly as the MPC thinks \u2013 even when one-off factors such as last year's VAT rise cease to have an impact. Thirdly, the economy may be stronger than the 0.2% drop in output in the final three months of 2011 would indicate. The survey of the service sector from CIPS/Markit released on Friday was the strongest for 10 months and consistent with the sector growing at around 0.7% on the quarter. Internationally, the news has also been better: activity in the eurozone as a whole (if not in some of its constituent members) looks to be bottoming out, while the latest jobs news from the US economy was strong. Greece is on the point of getting its debt relief from its private sector creditors, and the pressure has eased on Italy and Spain. We are back to where we were in early 2009: when the global economy was starting to recover but the mood was so gloomy that nobody could spot the upswing. The final point is this: at some stage the Bank will need to unwind the monetary easing of the past three and a half years, selling gilts back into the financial markets. This is going to be tricky to achieve without leading to a collapse in the price of government bonds, and the more bonds the Bank has to sell the trickier it is going to be. This matters because the price of gilts goes in inverse proportion to the yield or interest rate payable on them. When the price of gilts goes down, long-term interest rates go up, so the challenge for the Bank is to unwind QE without triggering a run on gilts that would push the economy back into recession. Even so, it would come as a surprise if, at noon on Thursday, the Bank announced that it was adopting a suck-it-and-see approach. Threadneedle Street is unlikely to be swayed by the recent survey evidence, and will note that the service sector's purchasing managers' index (PMI) does not include retail spending, which looks to have been weak in early 2012 as consumers retrench after a Christmas spending spree. Despite the recent fall in inflation, prices are still rising more rapidly than earnings, putting a squeeze on real incomes, albeit more modestly than during 2011. Flows of credit to the private sector remain weak and the housing market is in the doldrums. The long and painful deleveraging from excess debt by the private sector will continue for some time yet. There are two concerns about the state of the eurozone. The first is that even if Greece's debt can be put on a sustainable footing (and that looks highly improbable), Portugal is showing worrying signs that it will need a second bailout. Exhaustive efforts by the European commission and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to make Greece a special case look doomed to fail. The second concern is that while the ECB's long-term refinancing operations have stabilised the eurozone economy, the intractable structural issues \u2013 a lack of competitiveness in the weaker economies, the self-defeating nature of generalised austerity \u2013 remain unresolved. When it announced the second round of QE back in November, it was the state of Europe that forced the Bank's hand. Given the frequent false dawns over the past year, the chances of a further flare-up in the crisis remains high. What concerns the Bank is not just the direct trade links between the UK and its continental partners but the potential for any freezing up of the European financial system to be transmitted across the Channel into an intensification of the credit crunch. Inaction by the Bank would make life harder for George Osborne. The government's case for the past 18 months is that the Treasury bears down on the budget deficit to allow the MPC to keep monetary policy loose. There is a case for saying that monetary policy is shouldering too much of the burden and that the chancellor ought to use the budget to provide the sort of modest boost sanctioned by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last week. Osborne is reluctant to go down that road. He believes he has a tacit deal with Sir Mervyn King and he expects the governor to deliver.",

      "bodyText": "To say Hartlepool is having a hard time would be an understatement. Every job vacancy in this seaside town 30 miles south of Newcastle attracts an average of 16 applicants and nearly one in 10 men are claiming benefits. In Owton Manor, a down-at-heel suburb in the south-west of the town, things are even worse. Nearly half of the 4,100 people who live there are without work. At the community centre, Jacqueline, who didn't want to give her full name, is doing her weekly volunteering, manning the reception, but has plenty on her mind. Her 20-year-old son, who lives with her, has had his housing benefit cut and she can't afford to subsidise him and worries that he will end up on the streets. Her husband does shift work for the minimum wage, but is to lose his job at the local JD Sports warehouse because it is being moved to Manchester. But it is the cuts to the buses that really gets her angry. \"You can't get a bus after 6pm, they have stopped them,\" she said. \"It is like we are being segregated. You just can't get anywhere. I don't understand why they are doing it.\" In Hartlepool it had felt, for a while, that things were perhaps getting better. In May 1985 unemployment reached a high of more than 10,000 adults in a town once dependent on the steel and shipbuilding industries. With the help of large-scale, centrally funded regeneration projects, led in part by the soon-to-be-defunct ONE North East regional development agency, that was reduced to 2,000 people by May 2005. The key, the council said, had been to encourage local entrepreneurs because it had become obvious that the foreign companies who initially set up call centres in the north-east had found cheaper employees in the far east. But small businesses need assistance, nurturing \u2013 and access to finance. In the past two years, unemployment has gone up again to 4,451 and the local authority expects the picture to be considerably worse over the next year as they cut 33% from their budget. Kevin Sander, who runs Owton's community centre, is despairing: \"We are being allowed to rot. They say we will benefit from the London Olympics because some guy is going to run through the town with a torch. I mean, come on.\" There are, of course, similarly impoverished places across England. The east of London has a fair few, for example, but the statistics are stark \u2013 if you live in the north of England it is more likely that you are suffering. Of the 10 towns with the largest number of businesses going bust in 2011, seven are from the northernmost parts of the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Humberside. According to estate agents Rightmove, the north of England and the Midlands have seen the average property price fall from \u00a3174,053 in 2007 to \u00a3155,925 this month. Over the same period in the south, the average house price rose from \u00a3285,137 to \u00a3311,037. And as revealed in the Observer today, the loss of jobs in the north of England is four times as deep in comparison to the rest of the nation, with an 18% year-on-year increase in unemployment compared with 4.5% elsewhere. There has been a 25% increase (31,000 additional people) in the ranks of the unemployed in the north-east, 16.9% (44,000) in the north-west and 11.6% (23,000) in Yorkshire and Humberside. In comparison, there has been a rise in unemployment of 4.5% (12,000) in the south-east of England and 10.4% (40,000) in London. In the south-west the increase is even smaller, 3.7% (15,000), while the West Midlands has seen a decrease in unemployment of 7.4% (19,000). Sifting through the job cuts in the north of England, the Institute for Public Policy Research has found that it was initially the private sector that saw the squeeze as small businesses were hit by banks not lending. Over the past 20 months, the government's cuts to local authority funding mean the losses are now predominantly in the public sector, specifically those working in healthcare in the north-east, education in the north-west and careers advice in Yorkshire and Humberside. The northern regions, heavily reliant on the central government grant for their regeneration strategies, have been particularly hard hit by the chancellor George Osborne's austerity programme, critics claim. An analysis by Newcastle upon Tyne city council of the local authority budget cuts illustrates this inequity: northern cities and boroughs will lose \u00a3150 to \u00a3200 per head this year, while in the south-east, the west country and parts of the midlands, the cuts range from \u00a350 to zero. IPPR North additionally points out that, while the government spends \u00a32,731 per head on transport in London, it gives just \u00a35 per head in the north-east. It is true \u00a31.4bn has been allocated for a regional growth fund, but that does not compare with the \u00a314bn budget for London's Crossrail project. Is this what managed decline looks like? In 1999, in the first flush of his premiership, Tony Blair declared the north-south divide a thing of the past. Economic prosperity was being evenly shared across the country in an unprecedented way, the fresh-faced prime minister announced, as he laid the foundation stone for the new Commonwealth games stadium in east Manchester, before joining resident Barbara Taylor and a gaggle of photographers for a cup of tea and a photo opportunity in her kitchen. So what's gone wrong? Sitting in the small end-of-terrace home she has shared with her husband Bill, 66, for over 30 years, just a stone's throw from what is now Manchester City's Etihad stadium, TaylorBarbara, 63, has fond memories of Blair's visit and the improvements that followed. But she never believed the then prime minister's boasts on the subject of the north-south divide. \"The north-south divide has always been there and it will always be there,\" she said. Labour did lots for the area, Barbara admits. There wasn't a secondary school or a community centre, but then Labour built them. The young unemployed were offered training programmes and the housing stock was improved. But it was, on reflection, a sticking plaster. There has been diversification in Manchester's economy, as there has been elsewhere, into sales, service and finance companies, but the old industries upon which the deprived areas, here and in other northern towns and cities, were built have not really been replaced; many of the financial service companies have cut their regional presences now and retreated back to London, while the advances in education and training have not had time to bed in and bear fruit. Asda, Barbara says, is the big employer in her area, and now the cuts to the services, the training, apprenticeship programmes and even the graffiti-removing patrols are starting to bite (the damage is worst on derby days, when City play United, she says). \"It feels like we are going backwards again. They have taken away our crutch. I spoke to a young lad, a bit of a tearaway really, who is always on the streets. One day he said to me, 'You won't see me out here any more'. I said, 'What you being locked up for?' I was serious. But he said, 'No, no, I'm going on a bricklaying course. I'm going to be a bricklayer'. Saw him again a few months later back on the streets. I asked what had happened and he said he couldn't get a job. There's nothing for him.\" For Ed Cox, director at IPPR North, the tragedy is the waste of potential for growth that the country so desperately needs. \"I would argue that there were considerable improvements up until 2008, and when the Tories try to say that it didn't work to improve the imbalance between the north and south there is no counter-factual,\" Cox said. \"We don't know how things would be if those Labour policies had not been in place. We could probably say that in their own right they were relatively successful in trying to reverse a century of industrial decline. But that takes time. I believe places like Manchester are ripe to make progress and provide the growth the wider country needs, but that requires a focused regional policy. There doesn't appear to be that intensity to deal with the problem or that challenge any more, and now the progress has stalled in its tracks.\" Antony Steinberg, the economic development manager at Hartlepool borough council, also fears that the north of England's interests are not being prioritised. He said: \"We are very concerned about the government's change to the business rates. Previously the councils collected the rates and passed them on to central government to distribute according to need. Now the councils get to keep the business rates they collect. But we don't have the advantage enjoyed by councils in the south-east of being close to parliament, the financial services and the City [to attract businesses]. And what we do have is a chemical industry on our doorstep that will be put at a serious disadvantage by potential charges over carbon emissions.\" He added: \"We do need a voice.\" The growing sense that the needs of the northern regions are being ignored has led to the establishment of the Hannah Mitchell Foundation, a thinktank named after a campaigner for women's suffrage, whose goal it is to develop the case for directly elected regional government. Backed by Labour MPs acting as patrons, including former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott, shadow equalities minister Kate Green and prominent backbencher Jon Cruddas, the thinktank believes now is the time to make the case for the devolution of powers to the north from Westminster. It has been attempted before, of course. Prescott's hopes of setting up an elected assembly for the north-east came to nothing when 78% voted against it in a referendum in 2004. But, eight years on, the times are very different. Scotland's coming referendum on independence has left many in the north of England asking who is looking out for its interests as effectively as Alex Salmond north of the border. George Osborne's controversial suggestion in the autumn pre-budget report that public sector pay may be regionalised raised alarm bells on both sides of the Pennines. Upcoming mayoral elections in the northern cities of Bradford, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield may provide the building blocks from which to construct a future Council of the North which would have the clout to make Westminster sit up and take notice. Paul Salveson, a visiting professor at Huddersfield university, who is acting as the Hannah Mitchell Foundation's general secretary, said: \"I think what is happening in Scotland will bring this to the fore. If you look at the rest of Europe \u2013 Germany, France \u2013 they have strong regional government too, and it has made a big difference to them. \"We have had a credibility problem in the past about regional assemblies, but that was before Wales and Scotland and London, of course, showed how it could be done.\" The future of Hartlepool might depend on it. Outside the town's train station there is a long line of yellow taxis. In the past three years, 208 new taxi licences have been granted by the council in comparison to the 48 handed out in 2008. \"There is always a load of them now,\" said Pete Morgan, 46, who opened up the Rat Race real ale pub attached to the station after losing his job in computing two years ago. \"They are cutting each other's throats for passengers, but there aren't any other jobs so they become self-employed and do that. To be honest, anyone who wants a career leaves Hartlepool. What hope have we got here?\"",

      "body": "<p>To say Hartlepool is having a hard time would be an understatement. Every job vacancy in this seaside town 30 miles south of Newcastle attracts an average of 16 applicants and nearly one in 10 men are claiming benefits. In Owton Manor, a down-at-heel suburb in the south-west of the town, things are even worse. Nearly half of the 4,100 people who live there are without work.</p> <p>At the community centre, Jacqueline, who didn't want to give her full name, is doing her weekly volunteering, manning the reception, but has plenty on her mind. Her 20-year-old son, who lives with her, has had his housing benefit cut and she can't afford to subsidise him and worries that he will end up on the streets. Her husband does shift work for the minimum wage, but is to lose his job at the local JD Sports warehouse because it is being moved to Manchester.</p> <p>But it is the cuts to the buses that really gets her angry. \"You can't get a bus after 6pm, they have stopped them,\" she said. \"It is like we are being segregated. You just can't get anywhere. I don't understand why they are doing it.\"</p> <p>In Hartlepool it had felt, for a while, that things were perhaps getting better. In May 1985 unemployment reached a high of more than 10,000 adults in a town once dependent on the steel and shipbuilding industries. With the help of large-scale, centrally funded regeneration projects, led in part by the soon-to-be-defunct ONE North East regional development agency, that was reduced to 2,000 people by May 2005.</p> <p>The key, the council said, had been to encourage local entrepreneurs because it had become obvious that the foreign companies who initially set up call centres in the north-east had found cheaper employees in the far east. But small businesses need assistance, nurturing \u2013 and access to finance.</p> <p>In the past two years, unemployment has gone up again to 4,451 and the local authority expects the picture to be considerably worse over the next year as they cut 33% from their budget. Kevin Sander, who runs Owton's community centre, is despairing: \"We are being allowed to rot. They say we will benefit from the London Olympics because some guy is going to run through the town with a torch. I mean, come on.\"</p> <p>There are, of course, similarly impoverished places across England. The east of London has a fair few, for example, but the statistics are stark \u2013 if you live in the north of England it is more likely that you are suffering. Of the 10 towns with the largest number of businesses going bust in 2011, seven are from the northernmost parts of the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Humberside. According to estate agents Rightmove, the north of England and the Midlands have seen the average property price fall from \u00a3174,053 in 2007 to \u00a3155,925 this month. Over the same period in the south, the average house price rose from \u00a3285,137 to \u00a3311,037.</p> <p>And as revealed in the <em>Observer</em> today, the loss of jobs in the north of England is four times as deep in comparison to the rest of the nation, with an 18% year-on-year increase in unemployment compared with 4.5% elsewhere.

      "bodyText": "It's like Christmas all over again \u2013 for a lucky handful at least. In the high-class homes of Notting Hill, the mansions of Connecticut and luxury towers of Hong Kong, investment bankers are eagerly waiting for their bonus cheques to land. The latest round of bumper payouts could not come at a more incendiary time. The credit crisis that began almost five years ago is showing little sign of abating, unemployment is rising and pay for most workers is flatlining. Unsurprisingly, public anger about bonuses is growing. Politicians have piled into the debate in a week that saw Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Stephen Hester hand back his bonus and his widely vilified predecessor, Fred Goodwin, stripped of his knighthood. They were headline-grabbing gestures, but have done little to upset the status quo. Banks say bonus pools have shrunk and payouts are being capped, but outside the glitzy world of investment banking, those used to drawing just an annual salary are increasingly baffled by a system of hefty incentivisation on top of already high pay. To put the disparities into context, the average wage bill for one top banker would pay for almost 70 nurses. Understandably, questions are growing louder over how the banking system comes to award its staff so much, so often. For Labour leader Ed Miliband, the bonus culture has been \"corrosive\" for Britain's economy and its society. He argues the meaning of the term \"bonus\" has been lost along the years. \"Exceptional rewards for exceptional performance means million-pound bonuses should not be handed out to people for just doing their job,\" he said in a speech on Friday. In fact, he concluded, the system had failed. \"It has enriched individual bankers, but weakened the banking sector as a whole by encouraging a form of risk which crossed the line into sheer recklessness,\" said Miliband. \"For all the reform of the way bonuses are paid, they remain on a scale beyond the imagination of the vast majority of the population.\" The bonus system in banking is a hangover from the days of partnerships, where banks distributed all their gains because there were no shareholders. But that annual disbursement of cash to partners has lived on into the days of shareholder-owned banks and even, now, to state-controlled lenders. Professor Karel Williams at the Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change at the University of Manchester notes, however, that in the days of payouts to partners, those senior employees put up the capital and risked their own livelihoods. Their reward models have left the banking sector with \"compensation ratios\" \u2013 the proportion of revenues paid out to staff \u2013 commonly as high as 40%. In other words, unlike almost any other industry, senior employees are able to grab an extraordinarily large slice of the firm's revenues \u2013 not its profits, but its turnover. Traders therefore have an incentive to boost the volume of business coming in the door, rather than the long-term strength of their firm. Williams says banks have only been able to generate such extraordinary rewards by leveraging \u2013 making bets with borrowed money. \"The banks were living in a world of shareholder value, where they were under pressure to deliver returns on equity of 15 to 20%. What they did was they levered up,\" he says. He adds that so-called proprietary (or \"prop\") trading, where banks use their own money to make risky investment bets, was another way of supercharging returns for investors, and therefore for the traders involved. \"What did they do with all this money? The short answer is, they passed it around within the financial system,\" he says. Williams believes these bumper payouts distort the traditional role of the shareholder-owned firm, which is meant to distribute surplus income to investors: \"I would describe it as the corruption of a public company.\" He says no one complained about these lavish remuneration packages in the good times, because \"the first rule of stock markets is: people who succeed are allowed to get away with murder\". He believes that the government should legislate to bring compensation ratios down. Other critics of the bonus system argue it has sucked money away from elsewhere in society. Tapping into anger in the business community over the difficulty of getting bank loans, Miliband argued that if banks were to show greater restraint on pay, there would be more money left over for them to lend. Tony Greenham of thinktank the New Economics Foundation believes deregulating financial services has boosted their profitability \u2013 on the surface at least \u2013 but that has come at a cost to others. \"These profits have turned out either to be illusory, or not wealth that's been created, but resources that have been extracted from various parts of the economy,\" he says. \"Finance is not like other sectors. If you deregulate finance then it begins to have monopoly control over the rest of the economy.\" What has resulted in the pay stakes is a divergence from the rest of society. \"It used to be that as a stockbroker or a merchant banker, if you were on the golf course with a surgeon or a headmaster, you'd be in the same world. You're not in the same world any more,\" says Greenham. Bankers' pay is notoriously opaque, so trying to gauge the gap on those golf courses is tricky. Remuneration typically consists of complex packages of base salary, plus bonuses of cash, shares and options that vary from one employee to another, never mind from bank to bank. So it is difficult to come up with a benchmark. But recent data suggests the average remuneration for 1,265 senior bank staff was \u00a31.8m in 2010. In an analysis of regulatory disclosures by eight leading banks, the Guardian found that the average pay deal was \u00a31m or more for employees regarded as having the most influence over risk-taking activities at their firms. The highest average was at Goldman Sachs (\u00a34m) and the lowest at HSBC (\u00a31m), during a year when data from the Office for National Statistics showed the average wage in the UK was \u00a325,900. To put it another way, the average \u00a31.8m payout was the equivalent to the salaries for 68 nurses, based on an average income of \u00a326,438. Recent research in the US by Thomas Philipon and Ariell Reshef found a growing divide between financial sector pay and wages in the rest of the economy (see chart). What makes a banker imagine they are worth so much? Labour market expert John Philpott puts it down to business talk about \"talent\". \"They treat themselves as though they're in the same situation as superstar sportspeople or entertainers,\" says Philpott, who is economic adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. Banks, he says, \"set people up as particularly special, whereas the degree to which the supply of financial services experts is fixed is highly questionable. There's a lot of evidence to suggest the success of these people is contextual, and if they go to different establishments, they often perform worse.\" Philpott cites a further kind of damage to society from the lavish rewards available in finance: a brain drain. \"A lot of people who would probably have gone into more productive endeavours \u2013 engineering or maths graduates \u2013 go into finance instead.\" He expects total remuneration packages in banking to come down over the coming years, and there are signs from within the banking world itself that he may be right. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who recently turned down a \u00a31.4m bonus, has argued bankers' compensation is excessive. \"Pay has been high for too long, particularly in the banks, particularly in the investment banks,\" he told BBC radio. \"Shareholders have done pretty badly and employees have done pretty well over the last 10 years. \"That needs to be corrected. It isn't a society or fairness issue, it is a straightforward business issue. Too much of the money is not going to the right place and the shareholder rewards have not been sufficient.\" Before anyone in the finance world starts to whine about the prospects of pay cuts, one of the world's top investment bankers has some harsh words. Morgan Stanley boss James Gorman says anyone who does not understand falling pay needs a reality check. He offers them a three-point life plan: \"You're naive. Read the newspaper, number one,\" he says. \"Number two: if you put your compensation in a one-year context to define your overall level of happiness, you have a problem which is much bigger than the job. And number three: If you're really unhappy, just leave. I mean, life's too short.\"",

    "webTitle": "Botox helps to create an Irish boom town amid economic gloom", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Under the shadow of Ireland's holiest mountain, Croagh Patrick, in one of the most bucolic parts of the country's Atlantic seaboard, the global production hub of Botox is preparing for a major gear change. Allergan, which manufactures the wrinkle-busting cosmetic on the outskirts of Westport in Co Mayo, estimates that within five years 60% of Botox sales will be for illnesses ranging from cerebral palsy to chronic migraines as well as for anti-ageing treatments. Despite the recession and a banking crisis that has almost bankrupted the Irish state, the pharmaceutical industry has kept faith with the republic, where nine of the top 10 global pharma companies still have a presence. This month Allergan announced it is expanding its workforce in the west of Ireland tourist trap to more than 1,000 as well as building a new research and development centre in the coastal town. Allergan's quarterly profit figures were revealed last Thursday in the US at $279.8m (\u00a3176m), up 6% from last year's fourth quarter. Global sales of Botox, which remains its key product, grew 8% in the fourth quarter to $415.3m. Regardless of the eurozone turmoil and global recession, consumers and health bodies are still clamouring for Botox. As Ireland seeks to trade its way out of the doldrums, Allergan's decision marks a vote of confidence among the multinational business community that helped fuel the country's economic revolution during the 1990s. The company has a long history of involvement in the republic and its presence is estimated to inject an average $25m of capital expenditure in the republic per annum. Allergan's managing director in Ireland, Pat O'Donnell, grew up on a 26-acre farm just five miles from the Westport plant. Straight from college, the genial O'Donnell worked his way up from lab technician in the 1980s to lead the entire Irish operation. He is keen to emphasise that Botox is much more than an intravenous means of rolling back ageing. \"What a lot of people don't realise is that at present about 50% of the revenue we get from Botox is cosmetic, but the rest comes from therapeutic treatments such as juvenile cerebral palsy, adult spasticity and, just recently, we got approval for chronic migraine and overactive bladder in people with spinal cord injuries or patients suffering from MS. \"We expect that in the next four to five years it will probably switch to 60% of the revenue coming from therapeutic treatments rather than cosmetic,\" says O'Donnell, who explains that the use of Botox to counter chronic migraine evolved out of its use as a beauty treatment. \"Botox was being used to treat wrinkles and lines in the forehead, and some people doing that reported a reduction in migraine pain. I met a woman at a medical conference who told me she went from suffering around 28 days a month with severe migraine to just a few once she started using Botox.\" He stresses that Botox is not the only product made in the Westport plant. Other therapies include Ozurdex, a steroid implant that counteracts the onset of blindness by reducing inflammation of the retina. Barry O'Leary, chief executive of Ireland's Industrial Development Authority, whose inducements helped entice Allergan to Ireland, says its investment proves that the republic is still an attractive location for multinational industries, adding that its expansion at a time of recession is \"a welcome endorsement of Ireland's record with the development and manufacturing model. \"Nine of the top 10 global pharma and biopharma companies have a significant presence in Ireland. The sector benefits from a highly skilled workforce, an exceptionally strong track record in development, manufacturing and compliance, a competitive tax rate and easy access to global markets.\" O'Leary's optimism about the country's ability to keep the multinationals, particularly US corporations, is tempered this month by the ongoing fiscal crisis both in Ireland and the eurozone. In general, the economic news continues to cast a pall of gloom over the entire country. Last week, the Irish Central Bank downgraded the estimates for growth. It said Ireland would grow by 0.5% in 2012 and not 1.8% as the Fine Gael-Labour government had predicted. Unemployment remains one of the highest in the EU, with more than 14% of the labour force out of work, while emigration continues apace. Yet, unlike so many places in Ireland, the \"To Let\" and \"Closing Down Sale\" signs that proliferate all over main streets from the capital to the smallest village are more or less absent in the centre of Westport. Allergan's presence and continued demand for Botox appears to have saved it from the worst ravages of the economic downturn. The town, which Beirut hostage Brian Keenan chose as a haven to settle in after his release years of captivity during the 1980s, also has a multinational feel. Twelve languages are spoken at the Allergan plant and, as O'Donnell notes, the workforce has stayed loyal to the town and the company, with the average worker spending 11 years at the factory. \"That demonstrates serious loyalty and a lot of what we do is commercially sensitive with very specialised, technical knowledge. So because we can keep that within the organisation by virtue of the fact that we have a low employee turnover, it makes Westport even more attractive,\" O'Donnell says. Although he underlines the importance of having a highly educated, skilled workforce that has access to a European market of 500 million consumers, O'Donnell concedes that the republic's low 12.5% corporation tax rate is still a major factor in convincing hard-nosed US executives that Ireland should be their foreign manufacturing base. Such is the success of the corporate tax rate in attracting hi-tech export-driven foreign direct investment that the devolved government north of the border in Belfast has been petitioning the UK Treasury, thus far unsuccessfully, to grant Northern Ireland special status and lower its rate to the same level as the south. \"It's hugely important for a couple of reasons,\" says O'Donnell. \"One, of course, is the low rate \u2013 and the message that it is staying low is vital. It should not even move, because once it starts to move that would send a negative psychological signal to corporations. The corporation tax is the bedrock, but it is also important that Ireland has a very transparent tax system, which works to our advantage. As well as manufacturing, Allergan runs a lot of its financial services in Ireland because of our tax system.\" Allergan is based in the home constituency of Ireland's prime minister, Enda Kenny. When it comes to corporation tax and attempts by the republic's European partners, particularly the French, to try to tie Ireland's EU bailout to changes in the capital taxation regime, O'Donnell's message to the taoiseach is simple: \"Fight, fight and fight again to keep our corporation tax rate. We must always, always leave that 12.5% rate alone and don't mess with it.\"",

He is keen to emphasise that Botox is much more than an intravenous means of rolling back ageing.</p> <p>\"What a lot of people don't realise is that at present about 50% of the revenue we get from Botox is cosmetic, but the rest comes from therapeutic treatments such as juvenile cerebral palsy, adult spasticity and, just recently, we got approval for chronic migraine and overactive bladder in people with spinal cord injuries or patients suffering from MS.</p> <p>\"We expect that in the next four to five years it will probably switch to 60% of the revenue coming from therapeutic treatments rather than cosmetic,\" says O'Donnell, who explains that the use of Botox to counter chronic migraine evolved out of its use as a beauty treatment. \"Botox was being used to treat wrinkles and lines in the forehead, and some people doing that reported a reduction in migraine pain. I met a woman at a medical conference who told me she went from suffering around 28 days a month with severe migraine to just a few once she started using Botox.\"</p> <p>He stresses that Botox is not the only product made in the Westport plant. Other therapies include Ozurdex, a steroid implant that counteracts the onset of blindness by reducing inflammation of the retina.</p> <p>Barry O'Leary, chief executive of Ireland's Industrial Development Authority, whose inducements helped entice Allergan to Ireland, says its investment proves that the republic is still an attractive location for multinational industries, adding that its expansion at a time of recession is \"a welcome endorsement of Ireland's record with the development and manufacturing model.</p> <p>\"Nine of the top 10 global pharma and biopharma companies have a significant presence in Ireland. The sector benefits from a highly skilled workforce, an exceptionally strong track record in development, manufacturing and compliance, a competitive tax rate and easy access to global markets.\"</p> <p>O'Leary's optimism about the country's ability to keep the multinationals, particularly US corporations, is tempered this month by the ongoing fiscal crisis both in Ireland and the eurozone. In general, the economic news continues to cast a pall of gloom over the entire country. Last week, the Irish Central Bank downgraded the estimates for growth. It said Ireland would grow by 0.5% in 2012 and not 1.8% as the Fine Gael-Labour government had predicted. Unemployment remains one of the highest in the EU, with more than 14% of the labour force out of work, while emigration continues apace.</p> <p>Yet, unlike so many places in Ireland, the \"To Let\" and \"Closing Down Sale\" signs that proliferate all over main streets from the capital to the smallest village are more or less absent in the centre of Westport. Allergan's presence and continued demand for Botox appears to have saved it from the worst ravages of the economic downturn.</p> <p>The town, which Beirut hostage Brian Keenan chose as a haven to settle in after his release years of captivity during the 1980s, also has a multinational feel. Twelve languages are spoken at the Allergan plant and, as O'Donnell notes, the workforce has stayed loyal to the town and the company, with the average worker spending 11 years at the factory.</p> <p>\"That demonstrates serious loyalty and a lot of what we do is commercially sensitive with very specialised, technical knowledge. So because we can keep that within the organisation by virtue of the fact that we have a low employee turnover, it makes Westport even more attractive,\" O'Donnell says.</p> <p>Although he underlines the importance of having a highly educated, skilled workforce that has access to a European market of 500 million consumers, O'Donnell concedes that the republic's low 12.5% corporation tax rate is still a major factor in convincing hard-nosed US executives that Ireland should be their foreign manufacturing base.</p> <p>Such is the success of the corporate tax rate in attracting hi-tech export-driven foreign direct investment that the devolved government north of the border in Belfast has been petitioning the UK Treasury, thus far unsuccessfully, to grant Northern Ireland special status and lower its rate to the same level as the south.</p> <p>\"It's hugely important for a couple of reasons,\" says O'Donnell. \"One, of course, is the low rate \u2013 and the message that it is staying low is vital. It should not even move, because once it starts to move that would send a negative psychological signal to corporations. The corporation tax is the bedrock, but it is also important that Ireland has a very transparent tax system, which works to our advantage. As well as manufacturing, Allergan runs a lot of its financial services in Ireland because of our tax system.\"</p> <p>Allergan is based in the home constituency of Ireland's prime minister, Enda Kenny. When it comes to corporation tax and attempts by the republic's European partners, particularly the French, to try to tie Ireland's EU bailout to changes in the capital taxation regime, O'Donnell's message to the taoiseach is simple: \"Fight, fight and fight again to keep our corporation tax rate. We must always, always leave that 12.5% rate alone and don't mess with it.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "During the past 30 years, a growing share of the global economic pie has been taken by the world's wealthiest people. In the UK and the US, the share of national income going to the top 1% has doubled, setting workforces adrift from economic progress. Today, the world's 1,200 billionaires hold economic firepower that is equivalent to a third of the size of the American economy. It is this concentration of income \u2013 at levels not seen since the 1920s \u2013 that is the real cause of the present crisis. In the UK, the upward transfer of income from wage earners to business and the mega-wealthy amounts to the equivalent of 7% of the economy. UK wage-earners have around \u00a3100bn \u2013 roughly equivalent to the size of the nation's health budget \u2013 less in their pockets today than if the cake were shared as it was in the late 1970s. In the US, the sum stands at \u00a3500bn. There a typical worker would be more than \u00a33,000 better off if the distribution of output between wages and profits had been held at its 1979 level. In the UK, they would earn almost \u00a32,000 more. The effect of this consolidation of economic power is that the two most effective routes out of the crisis have been closed. First, consumer demand \u2013 the oxygen that makes economies work \u2013 has been choked off. Rich economies have lost billions of pounds of spending power. Secondly, the slump in demand might be less damaging if the winners from the process of upward redistribution \u2013 big business and the top 1% \u2013 were playing a more productive role in helping recovery. They are not. Britain's richest 1,000 have accumulated fortunes that are collectively worth \u00a3250bn more than a decade ago. The biggest global corporations are also sitting on near-record levels of cash. In the UK, such corporate surpluses stand at over \u00a360bn, around 5% of the size of the economy. This money could be used to kickstart growth. Yet it is mostly standing idle. The result is paralysis. The economic orthodoxy of the past 30 years holds that a stiff dose of inequality brings more efficient and faster-growing economies. It was a theory that captured the New Labour leadership \u2013 as long as tackling poverty was made a priority, then the rich should be allowed to flourish. So have the architects of market capitalism been proved right? The evidence says no. The wealth gap has soared, but without wider economic progress. Since 1980, UK growth and productivity rates have been a third lower and unemployment five times higher than in the postwar era of \"regulated capitalism\". The three post-1980 recessions have been deeper and longer than those of the 1950s and 1960s, culminating in the crisis of the last four years. The main outcome of the post-1980 experiment has been an economy that is much more polarised and much more prone to crisis. History shows a clear link between inequality and instability. The two most damaging crises of the last century \u2013 the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Crash of 2008 \u2013 were both preceded by sharp rises in inequality. The factor linking excessive levels of inequality and economic crisis is to be found in the relationship between wages and productivity. For the two-and-a-half decades from 1945, wages and productivity moved broadly in line across richer nations, with the proceeds of rising prosperity evenly shared. This was also a period of sustained economic stability. Then there have been two periods when wages have seriously lagged behind productivity \u2013 in the 1920s and the post-1980s. Both of them culminating in prolonged slumps. Between 1990 and 2007, real wages in the UK rose more slowly than productivity, and at a worsening rate. In the US, the decoupling started earlier and has led to an even larger gap. The significance of a growing \"wage-productivity gap\" is that it upsets the natural mechanisms necessary to achieve economic balance. Purchasing power shrinks and consumer societies suddenly lack the capacity to consume. In both the 1920s and the post-1980s, to prevent economies seizing up, the demand gap was filled by an explosion of private debt. But pumping in debt didn't prevent recession: it merely delayed it. Concentrating the proceeds of growth in the hands of a small global financial elite not only brings mass deflation \u2013 it also leads to asset bubbles. In 1920s America, a rapid process of enrichment at the top merely fed years of speculative activity in property and the stock market. In the build-up to 2008, rising corporate surpluses and burgeoning personal wealth led to a giant mountain of footloose global capital. The cash sums held by the world's rich (those with cash of more than $1m) doubled in the decade to 2008 to a massive $39 trillion. Only a tiny proportion of this sum ended up in productive investment. In the decade to 2007, bank lending for property development and takeover activity surged while the share going to UK manufacturing shrank. While the contribution to the economy made by financial services more than doubled over this period, manufacturing fell by a quarter. Far from creating new wealth, a tsunami of \"hot money\" raced around the world in search of faster and faster returns, creating bubbles \u2013 in property, commodities and business \u2013 lowering economic resilience and amplifying the risk of financial breakdown. New Labour's leaders were right in arguing that the left needed to have a more coherent policy for wealth creation. That is the route to wider prosperity for all. But the central lesson of the last 30 years is that a widening income gap and a more productive economy do not go hand in hand. An economic model that allows the richest members of society to accumulate a larger and larger share of the cake will eventually self-destruct. It is a lesson that is yet to be learned.

      "bodyText": "The circuit board of skyscrapers in Tokyo's tech district glints in the winter sunshine, with the Sony Technology Centre seemingly reaching up to the sky. It stands proudly alongside the other titans of Japan Inc such as Panasonic in the Shinagawa district \u2013 but in reality these are crumbling empires, their very foundations chipped away by the aggression of Samsung and the design brilliance of Apple. Last week, Sony's Welsh-born boss, Sir Howard Stringer, the first foreigner to hold the top job, paid the price for his failure to turn the company around. Company veteran Kazuo Hirai, who has a record as a hard-nosed cost-cutter, will take over from him in April \u2013 but with a near \u00a32bn annual loss on the horizon there will be no cheerleading from the new leader: he said he felt \"an acute sense of crisis\" and identified a need to push through urgent change. The heavy losses at Sony were mirrored at Panasonic and Sharp, and the bleak scene was completed when Japan itself reported its first annual trade deficit since 1980, blamed on the impact of the tsunami and the strong yen. Within the business community there are whispers of a sense of paralysis or \"hopelessness\", and the fear that if decisive action is not taken, some of the companies that were the engine for Japan's postwar growth could fall into irreversible decline. \"Japanese companies cannot keep doing what they have been doing,\" says Hiroshi Mikitani, the founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten. His company, which is worth more than \u00a37.6bn, is not a household name in the UK yet, although many Britons are now indirect customers of Mikitani's following Rakuten's acquisition of UK e-retailer Play.com for \u00a325m last year and Kobo, the Canadian ebook maker, for \u00a3200m. At home it is best known for Rakuten Ichiba, the country's biggest online marketplace \u2013 ahead of Amazon \u2013 with more than 37,000 merchants selling almost everything from noodles and sushi to Japanese ceremonial armour. With annual sales of \u00a32.6bn in 2010, its operations also span banking, travel ticketing and even a mediocre professional baseball team \u2013 the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, which finished fifth in a league of six teams last season. Mikitani is confident Rakuten can take on Amazon around the world. Its Ichiba website has been likened to a \"blog with a shopping cart attached\": merchants are encouraged to talk to customers and give internet shopping a \"human face\" \u2013 unlike Amazon, which, he says, is just a \"gigantic vending machine\". Rakuten's strategy is to build alliances and it hopes the Kobo will be a more \"open source\" option than Amazon's Kindle for retailers and publishers. \"There are lots of companies that don't like Amazon because they want to control and dominate everything,\" says Mikitani. \"We are more alliance-oriented \u2026 We want to establish relationships with retailers.\" The self-made billionaire, whose early career was in banking, claims Japanese executives lack a global perspective \u2013 a syndrome that has been called \"Galapagos-isation\", referring to the tendency among Japanese companies to focus on the tastes and demands of an isolated and shrinking home market rather than take risks abroad. The country's electronics sector has been hit by the success of South Korea's Samsung and LG, which assemble products in lower-cost countries such as China, Indonesia and Thailand. There have also been spectacular own goals: Japan had web-surfing handsets nearly a decade before the iPhone, yet local producers failed to tap overseas markets. Management writer Simon Caulkin says there is still much to admire about Japanese manufacturers, not least their \"miraculous\" recovery after the Fukushima disaster, and the Toyota production system, which is still is one of the \"wonders of the industrial world\". One criticism, says Caulkin, is that in areas such as consumer electronics and cameras, Japanese companies are so focused on competing with their immediate peers that they miss the big picture. The classic case is Sony, ironically the most \"western-facing\" of the big Japanese firms, which had all the ingredients to create an iTunes-style online music store but was completely outflanked by Apple. \"Even when Sony knew what Jobs was up to, it couldn't get it together because it was undermined by squabbling divisions, each struggling to protect its empire,\" explains Caulkin. \"Apple, on the other hand, had a completely integrated view. It [was] one company, no divisions, one profit and loss account, under an utterly focused Steve Jobs.\" Stringer's turnaround was said to be hampered by a resistance to change, and he recently quipped to one interviewer: \"Love affairs with the status quo continue even after the quo has lost its status.\" One western executive based in Tokyo says that decision-making in a typical Japanese company is by consensus: \"It can take six months and nothing will happen. They tried to build a consensus on everything. But once the strategy is decided everybody goes for it \u2013 for better or worse.\" Last year, in an unusual step even for large Japanese multinationals such as Sony or Toyota, Mikitani switched Rakuten's official language to English. \"We need to change the mindset of every single Japanese person,\" says Mikitani, who is likened to some of the country's other successful entrepreneurs such as Tadashi Yanai, founder of the clothier Uniqlo, and Masayoshi Son, chief executive of mobile phone network Softbank. \"We don't push out a Japanese model to our subsidiaries. The lack of global vision is partly coming from the language [barrier].\" To highlight Rakuten's swift decision-making process, he adds: \"We did the Kobo deal in a week.\" Rakuten occupies a former Sony building in Shinagawa: the stunning panorama from the top floor belies a dingy interior, as strict energy controls in the wake of Fukushima see lights dimmed and heating switched off in some areas. With a nod to Wal-Mart, Mikitani preaches the Rakuten shugi or \"way\", starting the day with the asakai morning meeting in a cavernous auditorium where the latest sales figures are discussed. The Monday meeting has been switched to Tuesday so that managers from other countries can be patched in. Rakuten's egalitarian code is spelt out in a handbook, telling staff that they must all clean their offices together (including desks, whiteboards and \"even chair legs\"); that their work ID badge should be pinned with pride on the \"left side of your chest\"; and that they should \"greet each other enthusiastically\". Whether Rakuten's model will be embraced by its peers remains to be seen but Mikitani is undaunted: \"We are going to be very aggressive. You need to be agile and have vision.\" Other Japanese companies are closely watching its progress in the west. \"If we succeed,\" he adds cautiously, \"then they will follow us.\" And will they succeed? He points to Carlos Ghosn's success in reviving Nissan: \"I think the Sony brand can be revived. I think [electronics companies] will come back. They will wake up.\"",

Company veteran Kazuo Hirai, who has a record as a hard-nosed cost-cutter, will take over from him in April \u2013 but with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/02/sony-warns-annual-loss\" title=\"\">a near \u00a32bn annual loss on the horizon</a> there will be no cheerleading from the new leader: he said he felt \"an acute sense of crisis\" and identified a need to push through urgent change.</p> <p>The heavy losses at Sony were mirrored at Panasonic and Sharp, and the bleak scene was completed when Japan itself reported its first annual trade deficit since 1980, blamed on the impact of the tsunami and the strong yen.</p> <p>Within the business community there are whispers of a sense of paralysis or \"hopelessness\", and the fear that if decisive action is not taken, some of the companies that were the engine for Japan's postwar growth could fall into irreversible decline.</p> <p>\"Japanese companies cannot keep doing what they have been doing,\" says Hiroshi Mikitani, the founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten. His company, which is worth more than \u00a37.6bn, is not a household name in the UK yet, although many Britons are now indirect customers of Mikitani's following Rakuten's acquisition of UK e-retailer Play.com for \u00a325m last year and Kobo, the Canadian ebook maker, for \u00a3200m.</p> <p>At home it is best known for Rakuten Ichiba, the country's biggest online marketplace \u2013 ahead of Amazon \u2013 with more than 37,000 merchants selling almost everything from noodles and sushi to Japanese ceremonial armour. With annual sales of \u00a32.6bn in 2010, its operations also span banking, travel ticketing and even a mediocre professional baseball team \u2013 the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, which finished fifth in a league of six teams last season.</p> <p>Mikitani is confident Rakuten can take on Amazon around the world. Its Ichiba website has been likened to a \"blog with a shopping cart attached\": merchants are encouraged to talk to customers and give internet shopping a \"human face\" \u2013 unlike Amazon, which, he says, is just a \"gigantic vending machine\". Rakuten's strategy is to build alliances and it hopes the Kobo will be a more \"open source\" option than Amazon's Kindle for retailers and publishers. \"There are lots of companies that don't like Amazon because they want to control and dominate everything,\" says Mikitani. \"We are more alliance-oriented \u2026 We want to establish relationships with retailers.\"</p> <p>The self-made billionaire, whose early career was in banking, claims Japanese executives lack a global perspective \u2013 a syndrome that has been called \"Galapagos-isation\", referring to the tendency among Japanese companies to focus on the tastes and demands of an isolated and shrinking home market rather than take risks abroad.</p> <p>The country's electronics sector has been hit by the success of South Korea's Samsung and LG, which assemble products in lower-cost countries such as China, Indonesia and Thailand. There have also been spectacular own goals: Japan had web-surfing handsets nearly a decade before the iPhone, yet local producers failed to tap overseas markets.</p> <p>Management writer Simon Caulkin says there is still much to admire about Japanese manufacturers, not least their \"miraculous\" recovery after the Fukushima disaster, and the Toyota production system, which is still is one of the \"wonders of the industrial world\". One criticism, says Caulkin, is that in areas such as consumer electronics and cameras, Japanese companies are so focused on competing with their immediate peers that they miss the big picture.</p> <p>The classic case is Sony, ironically the most \"western-facing\" of the big Japanese firms, which had all the ingredients to create an iTunes-style online music store but was completely outflanked by Apple. \"Even when Sony knew what Jobs was up to, it couldn't get it together because it was undermined by squabbling divisions, each struggling to protect its empire,\" explains Caulkin. \"Apple, on the other hand, had a completely integrated view. It [was] one company, no divisions, one profit and loss account, under an utterly focused Steve Jobs.\"</p> <p>Stringer's turnaround was said to be hampered by a resistance to change, and he recently quipped to one interviewer: \"Love affairs with the status quo continue even after the quo has lost its status.\" One western executive based in Tokyo says that decision-making in a typical Japanese company is by consensus: \"It can take six months and nothing will happen. They tried to build a consensus on everything. But once the strategy is decided everybody goes for it \u2013 for better or worse.\"</p> <p>Last year, in an unusual step even for large Japanese multinationals such as Sony or Toyota, Mikitani switched Rakuten's official language to English. \"We need to change the mindset of every single Japanese person,\" says Mikitani, who is likened to some of the country's other successful entrepreneurs such as Tadashi Yanai, founder of the clothier Uniqlo, and Masayoshi Son, chief executive of mobile phone network Softbank. \"We don't push out a Japanese model to our subsidiaries. The lack of global vision is partly coming from the language [barrier].\" To highlight Rakuten's swift decision-making process, he adds: \"We did the Kobo deal in a week.\"</p> <p>Rakuten occupies a former Sony building in Shinagawa: the stunning panorama from the top floor belies a dingy interior, as strict energy controls in the wake of Fukushima see lights dimmed and heating switched off in some areas. With a nod to Wal-Mart, Mikitani preaches the Rakuten <em>shugi</em> or \"way\", starting the day with the <em>asakai</em> morning meeting in a cavernous auditorium where the latest sales figures are discussed. The Monday meeting has been switched to Tuesday so that managers from other countries can be patched in.</p> <p>Rakuten's egalitarian code is spelt out in a handbook, telling staff that they must all clean their offices together (including desks, whiteboards and \"even chair legs\"); that their work ID badge should be pinned with pride on the \"left side of your chest\"; and that they should \"greet each other enthusiastically\".</p> <p>Whether Rakuten's model will be embraced by its peers remains to be seen but Mikitani is undaunted: \"We are going to be very aggressive. You need to be agile and have vision.\" Other Japanese companies are closely watching its progress in the west. \"If we succeed,\" he adds cautiously, \"then they will follow us.\"</p> <p>And will they succeed? He points to Carlos Ghosn's success in reviving Nissan: \"I think the Sony brand can be revived. I think [electronics companies] will come back. They will wake up.\"</p>",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Scottish independence: Alex Salmond's economic battle plan against the world", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, used to claim that an independent Scotland would join fellow small, independent nations Iceland and Ireland in an \"arc of prosperity\". Since these putative bedfellows went bust, the SNP tends instead to cite Sweden, Denmark and Norway to support its argument that an economic separation from the old enemy would be to Scotland's benefit. But whether or not the timing of the proposed referendum in 2014 was chosen to coincide with 700th anniversary of the battle of Bannockburn, which many Scots argue is just a rumour put about by the Tories to make Salmond look as though he's more interested in claymore-wielding nostalgia than building a 21st-century state, the old contrarian has certainly picked a strange moment to advocate economic fragmentation. It's instructive that the SNP is no longer advocating joining the European single currency. After the extraordinary boom-bust cycle in Ireland, which was stuck with interest rates set in Frankfurt even when house prices were rocketing by more than 20% a year, freedom from the sterling area no longer seems such a prize. And the ideal that the inception of the euro would create a union of small, independent states that could each plough their own individualistic furrow has been swept away by events in Greece, Italy and Portugal, which are now effectively losing sovereignty over their own tax and spending policies as Brussels intervenes. Moreover, the \"fiscal compact\" \u2013 the strict set of rules on spending policy and government deficits that Germany has pushed as the solution to the debt crisis \u2013 would preclude Salmond from exactly the kind of Keynesian fiscal boost he would like to be allowed to administer when times are tough. Ireland is hanging on to its rock-bottom corporation tax rate for now, but the scope for fiscal independence will be drastically reduced in the new post-crisis world in which investors will no longer accept euro membership as a permanent pledge of solvency, come what may. Of course, even if a separate Scotland stuck with the pound, there would still have to be a divvying up of the national debt, and of revenues, and Edinburgh would have to turn to the bond markets on its own account to fill the gap. Research by Angus Armstrong, in the National Institute of Economic and Social Research's quarterly bulletin, tries to measure how large that gap is likely to be. Much would turn on how the revenues from the oil and gas fields off Scotland's coast were distributed. Armstrong calculates that if the spoils were divided geographically, as the Geneva conventions would suggest, the Scots would pocket 90% of revenues; if they were attributed by population, it would be just 9%. At first glance, Armstrong's arithmetic looks quite favourable to the Scots: if the Geneva conventions are applied, its current budget deficit would have been a reasonably healthy 4% of GDP for the past five years. But he also points out that this is likely to be a tough moment for a fledgling country to be venturing out into the world's bond markets. In other words, Scotland would almost certainly have to pay a considerably higher interest rate than the historic lows currently enjoyed by London. Armstrong also argues that this need to borrow would place tight limits on Salmond's freedom: \"In an era where solvency constraints imposed by international markets are increasingly stringent, particularly on countries without their own central bank, we expect there will be little latitude for tax competition.\" Investors know that, in extremis, the Bank of England could print money to bail out the government in Westminster; but it's no more clear that it would do so to rescue an independent Scotland than that the European Central Bank would stand behind Portugal or Spain. The over-riding logic of the euro-crisis \u2013 and arguably the development of the single currency over the past decade or so \u2013 has been to push countries towards ever-deeper fiscal co-ordination, with transfers of resources between one part of the euro area and another. That's exactly the model Scotland and the rest of the sterling area have developed over their 400-plus years of currency union, which the SNP wants to abandon.

      "body": "<p>Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, used to claim that an independent Scotland would join fellow small, independent nations Iceland and Ireland in an \"arc of prosperity\".</p> <p>Since these putative bedfellows went bust, the SNP tends instead to cite Sweden, Denmark and Norway to support its argument that an economic separation from the old enemy would be to Scotland's benefit.</p> <p>But whether or not the timing of the proposed referendum in 2014 was chosen to coincide with 700th anniversary of the battle of Bannockburn, which many Scots argue is just a rumour put about by the Tories to make Salmond look as though he's more interested in claymore-wielding nostalgia than building a 21st-century state, the old contrarian has certainly picked a strange moment to advocate economic fragmentation.</p> <p>It's instructive that the SNP is no longer advocating joining the European single currency. After the extraordinary boom-bust cycle in Ireland, which was stuck with interest rates set in Frankfurt even when house prices were rocketing by more than 20% a year, freedom from the sterling area no longer seems such a prize.</p> <p>And the ideal that the inception of the euro would create a union of small, independent states that could each plough their own individualistic furrow has been swept away by events in Greece, Italy and Portugal, which are now effectively losing sovereignty over their own tax and spending policies as Brussels intervenes.</p> <p>Moreover, the \"fiscal compact\" \u2013 the strict set of rules on spending policy and government deficits that Germany has pushed as the solution to the debt crisis \u2013 would preclude Salmond from exactly the kind of Keynesian fiscal boost he would like to be allowed to administer when times are tough.</p> <p>Ireland is hanging on to its rock-bottom corporation tax rate for now, but the scope for fiscal independence will be drastically reduced in the new post-crisis world in which investors will no longer accept euro membership as a permanent pledge of solvency, come what may.</p> <p>Of course, even if a separate Scotland stuck with the pound, there would still have to be a divvying up of the national debt, and of revenues, and Edinburgh would have to turn to the bond markets on its own account to fill the gap.</p> <p>Research by Angus Armstrong, in the National Institute of Economic and Social Research's quarterly bulletin, tries to measure how large that gap is likely to be. Much would turn on how the revenues from the oil and gas fields off Scotland's coast were distributed. Armstrong calculates that if the spoils were divided geographically, as the Geneva conventions would suggest, the Scots would pocket 90% of revenues; if they were attributed by population, it would be just 9%.</p> <p>At first glance, Armstrong's arithmetic looks quite favourable to the Scots: if the Geneva conventions are applied, its current budget deficit would have been a reasonably healthy 4% of GDP for the past five years.</p> <p>But he also points out that this is likely to be a tough moment for a fledgling country to be venturing out into the world's bond markets. In other words, Scotland would almost certainly have to pay a considerably higher interest rate than the historic lows currently enjoyed by London.</p> <p>Armstrong also argues that this need to borrow would place tight limits on Salmond's freedom: \"In an era where solvency constraints imposed by international markets are increasingly stringent, particularly on countries without their own central bank, we expect there will be little latitude for tax competition.\"</p> <p>Investors know that, in extremis, the Bank of England could print money to bail out the government in Westminster; but it's no more clear that it would do so to rescue an independent Scotland than that the European Central Bank would stand behind Portugal or Spain.</p> <p>The over-riding logic of the euro-crisis \u2013 and arguably the development of the single currency over the past decade or so \u2013 has been to push countries towards ever-deeper fiscal co-ordination, with transfers of resources between one part of the euro area and another. That's exactly the model Scotland and the rest of the sterling area have developed over their 400-plus years of currency union, which the SNP wants to abandon.</p> <p>Even if, as seems unlikely, London takes the most generous interpretation of Scotland's rights to revenue and the burden of public debt that should fall on its shoulders, Salmond may find that precisely the freedoms he wants to win \u2013 over tax and spending \u2013 could be undercut by the need to convince sceptical investors that Scotland can pay its own way in the world.</p> <p>Sir Mervyn King argued in a recent speech that the world economy faces a tough adjustment to an era where less borrowing is tolerated. \"After many years in which the stock of debt built up rapidly, there has been a reappraisal,\" he said. \"A reappraisal by markets of the strength of banks, by consumers of their income prospects, by lenders of the likelihood that debts will be repaid, by investors of the value of assets, and by markets of the value of currencies. The world economy is moving to a new equilibrium.\"</p> <p>Whatever the significance of 2014, Salmond may find it an inauspicious moment to launch a new nation out into the world.</p>",
