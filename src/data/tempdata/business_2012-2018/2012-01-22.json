      "body": "<p>Fitness First, one of the world's largest gym groups, has been forced into talks with its lending banks as the private equity-backed group \u2013 which had been hoping for a sale or stock market flotation \u2013 admitted it was struggling to meet spiralling interest bills.</p> <p>The business, which was founded by entrepreneur Mike Balfour as a single gym in Bournemouth 19 years ago, employs about 10,000 staff largely in the UK, Australia and Germany. Owners BC Partners had hoped to float Fitness First on the Singapore stock exchange, appointing advisers including Credit Suisse and JP Morgan last year.</p> <p>That plan was ditched last autumn and subsequent efforts to sell the business have proved fruitless.</p> <p>The last published accounts showed the group had net liabilities \u2013 the sum of its assets minus liabilities \u2013 of \u00a3612m in October 2010. A string of acquisitions and a debt-fuelled private equity structure had left the business, which has 1.2 million gym members, with borrowings of \u00a31.48bn. Much of that debt is held by BC Partners and smaller shareholders \u2013 \u00a3490m in the form of controversial high-interest bearing preference shares. Despite the tough economic climate, under a structure set up in 2005, these preference shares are entitled to an annual dividend of 15%, although payouts are deferred until 2015.</p> <p>The interest bill on similarly onerous preference shares at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/20/peacocks-collapse-rocks-retail-industry?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Peacocks </a>was blamed by some for fatally weakening the Cardiff-based fashion retailer, which fell into administration last week. Administrators from KPMG are looking to sell the business as a going concern. Despite many expressions of interest long-time Peacocks observers feel a piecemeal sell-off is more probable.</p> <p>Fitness First was floated on the junior AIM stock market in 1997 by Balfour, who went on to lead the business through a management buyout backed by Cinven in 2003. At the time his stake in the business was worth \u00a311m \u2014 half of which he is said to have reinvested alongside the new owners. Two years later, Balfour persuaded rival buyout group BC Partners to pay \u00a3835m for the business, funded by about \u00a3500m in borrowing.</p> <p>Balfour left the business in September 2009, several months after Tony de Leede, founder of the group's Australian business. Both still own significant amounts of shares \u2013 though the value of these is now unclear.</p> <p>BC Partners and others had injected \u00a350m worth of bonds into the business in the autumn of 2010 to help keep it in financial health. A month later, Fitness First's banks agreed to ease lending terms in exchange for higher interest rates. A more fundamental restructuring of the group's balance sheet is now required ahead of the loan maturing dates next year.</p> <p>Fitness First has sold its poor-performing Benelux business for \u00a324m \u2013 well below book value \u2013 to help cut borrowings. Stripping out debt owed to BC and other shareholders, Fitness First is now said to have net borrowings of \u00a3550m.

      "bodyText": "Fitness First, one of the world's largest gym groups, has been forced into talks with its lending banks as the private equity-backed group \u2013 which had been hoping for a sale or stock market flotation \u2013 admitted it was struggling to meet spiralling interest bills. The business, which was founded by entrepreneur Mike Balfour as a single gym in Bournemouth 19 years ago, employs about 10,000 staff largely in the UK, Australia and Germany. Owners BC Partners had hoped to float Fitness First on the Singapore stock exchange, appointing advisers including Credit Suisse and JP Morgan last year. That plan was ditched last autumn and subsequent efforts to sell the business have proved fruitless. The last published accounts showed the group had net liabilities \u2013 the sum of its assets minus liabilities \u2013 of \u00a3612m in October 2010. A string of acquisitions and a debt-fuelled private equity structure had left the business, which has 1.2 million gym members, with borrowings of \u00a31.48bn. Much of that debt is held by BC Partners and smaller shareholders \u2013 \u00a3490m in the form of controversial high-interest bearing preference shares. Despite the tough economic climate, under a structure set up in 2005, these preference shares are entitled to an annual dividend of 15%, although payouts are deferred until 2015. The interest bill on similarly onerous preference shares at Peacocks was blamed by some for fatally weakening the Cardiff-based fashion retailer, which fell into administration last week. Administrators from KPMG are looking to sell the business as a going concern. Despite many expressions of interest long-time Peacocks observers feel a piecemeal sell-off is more probable. Fitness First was floated on the junior AIM stock market in 1997 by Balfour, who went on to lead the business through a management buyout backed by Cinven in 2003. At the time his stake in the business was worth \u00a311m \u2014 half of which he is said to have reinvested alongside the new owners. Two years later, Balfour persuaded rival buyout group BC Partners to pay \u00a3835m for the business, funded by about \u00a3500m in borrowing. Balfour left the business in September 2009, several months after Tony de Leede, founder of the group's Australian business. Both still own significant amounts of shares \u2013 though the value of these is now unclear. BC Partners and others had injected \u00a350m worth of bonds into the business in the autumn of 2010 to help keep it in financial health. A month later, Fitness First's banks agreed to ease lending terms in exchange for higher interest rates. A more fundamental restructuring of the group's balance sheet is now required ahead of the loan maturing dates next year. Fitness First has sold its poor-performing Benelux business for \u00a324m \u2013 well below book value \u2013 to help cut borrowings. Stripping out debt owed to BC and other shareholders, Fitness First is now said to have net borrowings of \u00a3550m. Official accounts list its banks as Royal Bank of Scotland and Mizuho, although it is thought neither is among the many lenders with an exposure to the company. Fitness First declined to comment.",

    "webTitle": "David Cameron, the new Edward Heath?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government is thinking about putting an airport in the Thames estuary. It is ramming through a revamp of the National Health Service. Oil prices are high and there is trouble in the Middle East. The prime minister inveighs against the \"unacceptable face of capitalism\". Something strange is happening: we seem to be turning the clock back to the early 1970s. For Boris Island read Foulness; for Sir Keith Joseph read Andrew Lansley; for Tiny Rowland read Sir Fred Goodwin; for the Yom Kippur war read Iran's nuclear programme. Then, as now, there was much agonising about pay freezes, price rises and the dysfunctional state of the economy. So here's the question troubling one or two Conservatives: is David Cameron becoming the new Ted Heath? Will the prime minister be another moderniser who arrives in power bouncing with optimism but for whom it all goes wrong? There are differences as well as similarities: Heath presided over a largely pro-European party and considered his greatest achievement to be Britain's entry into what was then the European Economic Community. Cameron leads an overwhelmingly Eurosceptic party and would like a less binding relationship with the European Union. Heath would have signed up to the euro without question; there is no earthly chance of Cameron taking Britain into the single currency. But it is on the economy that Cameron, like Heath, will be judged. The prime minister appears to have a weakness for grandiose and unaffordable projects, just as Heath did. This prime minister wants to champion a more caring conservatism, and his musings last week on the \"crisis of capitalism\" contained an echo of Heath, who expressed disgust at the spivvery of the asset strippers and the property developers of early 1970s Britain. Both prime ministers have tried in vain to persuade the private sector to invest. This, though, is not sufficient evidence to make the charge stick. If Cameron is to become the new Heath five conditions have to be met. First, he has to inherit an economy gradually on the mend from a crisis but which still has deep structural problems and is actually a lot weaker than it looks. When Heath became prime minister in 1970, the recovery from the devaluation of 1967 was tentative and incomplete. The same could be said of the economy in May 2010 when Cameron arrived in Downing Street. Condition one is met. Second, there has to be a \"get tough\" phase. In Heath's first year he was a proto-Thatcherite, cutting spending and pushing up interest rates to curb inflation. As with Cameron's austerity programme, the result was slower growth, higher unemployment and soaring bankruptcies. Condition two is also met. The third condition is a botched reform of a key sector of the economy. In Heath's case it was the trade union movement, where the government pledged to modernise industrial relations but delivered little and ended up digging its own grave when it took on the miners in the winter of 1973-74. The reform challenge for Cameron is the City, where the government has talked a good game about the need for tighter regulation and restraint over bonuses but has yet to put much flesh on the bones. In the late 1970s, Labour came to regret dropping Barbara Castle's In Place of Strife union reforms of a decade earlier: Cameron may well end up feeling the same if he bottles a once in a lifetime opportunity to put the financial sector in order. Conclusion: condition three is not yet met, although it may well be. The fourth condition is a big external shock that knocks the economy for six. There were quite a few of these in the early 1970s, but two stood out: the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system and the Opec oil boycott of the west, which resulted in a fourfold rise in the crude price. Oil once again has the potential to wreck the government's economic plans: the other big headache is Europe, the destination for almost half of Britain's exports. Condition four could easily be met. The most important condition of all \u2013 a U-turn that goes wrong \u2013 has not yet been met. Heath changed course when unemployment reached 1 million for the first time since the second world war, a level seen as politically untenable at the time. Austerity was abandoned in a dash for growth. There is nothing wrong with a U-turn; indeed, if a policy is clearly not working it makes sense to try something else. Heath's decision to save Rolls-Royce by nationalising it flew in the face of his \"no lame ducks\" policy but proved to be a smart decision. Yet U-turns tend to be toxic in the UK and Cameron knows that to abandon the government's deficit reduction plan is highly risky, politically and economically. He believes anything that even smacked of a U-turn would result in a backlash from the bond markets that would send long-term interest rates soaring, killing off any hopes of recovery. He is probably right about that. Even so, there is a palpable sense of nervousness in Downing Street. Last week, George Osborne was certainly trying to prepare the ground for a weak growth figure this week, stressing that the Office for Budget Responsibility was forecasting a fall in output in the fourth quarter. Cameron's lament about the crisis of capitalism was not just an attempt to outflank Ed Miliband: it was timed to put down a marker before details of City bonuses show how much troughing there has been this year. There are limits even in placid old Britain, to how much the public will take: it is one thing to see the bankers coining it when your pay is going up, by more than inflation, quite another when you are 3% worse off than you were this time last year. But the real concern is the flatlining of the economy and the march of unemployment towards 3 million. Policymakers have responded, even though it would be wrong to say there has been a full U-turn. Osborne has admitted that he will need to borrow a lot more than he originally planned and will take a year longer to eliminate the structural deficit. Meanwhile, the Bank of England has been playing its part for Cameron just as it did for Heath. In the early 1970s, the policy response was something known as Competition and Credit Control, an utterly disastrous initiative whereby Threadneedle Street abandoned lending curbs and relied solely on its operations in the financial markets to control the money supply. The upshot was a credit binge, a property bubble and surging inflation. Today, the Bank is manipulating the money supply through quantitative easing. It has bought \u00a3275bn of government gilts so far, with the likelihood of more to come over the next few months. Nobody, not even Sir Mervyn King, can say for sure what the long-term inflationary consequences of this will be. In the meantime, Cameron can comfort himself with the thought that it is not Harold Wilson facing him across the dispatch box.",

      "bodyText": "A rising number of Britain's families say they will struggle to make ends meet this year and will cut back on spending, as the chancellor, George Osborne, braces himself for news that the economy slid into reverse in the final quarter of 2011. The government is hoping that the Queen's diamond jubilee and the summer Olympics will spread a party mood across the nation. But with unemployment rising and inflation running at twice the rate of pay growth, more than 32% of consumers plan to cut back on spending in the next 12 months, according to a new survey for the Resolution Foundation by pollsters Ipsos Mori. That compares with less than a fifth when the survey was last carried out in October. More than one in five of those surveyed, 23%, expect their financial situation to deteriorate over the next 12 months, compared with just 15% in October, underlining the growing pessimism that has taken hold since the eurozone crisis exploded in the autumn. Gavin Kelly, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \"Families that are already hard-pressed are preparing for yet another very tough year ahead. Given this gloomy backdrop, it's a real worry that a new round of cuts to tax credits planned for April will further dampen the spending power of low- to middle-income families.\" He added that weaker spending from consumers would depress growth at a time when export demand from Britain's largest market in Europe was likely to be declining. \"The longer households cut back on spending, the longer it will be before we see real economic recovery.\" Official GDP figures due to be released on Wednesday will show whether the economy expanded or contracted in the fourth quarter of 2011, as the debt crisis in the eurozone sapped confidence and depressed demand for exports. Many City analysts \u2013 and the independent Office for Budget Responsibility \u2013 are expecting a negative number, which could mark the start of a recession. \"We're looking for a small contraction. I think most people are,\" said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank. Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"Whatever the fourth quarter outcome, it is evident that the economy is struggling markedly at the moment and is in serious danger of slipping back into modest recession.\" The chancellor has conceded that the economic environment has darkened, saying last week: \"You don't have to tell me that the economic environment is very difficult for Britain, and indeed for the whole world.\" But Labour will seize on weak growth as evidence that the coalition's policies have clobbered the economy. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"2011 should have been the year when we secured economic recovery and saw unemployment continuing to fall. Instead we have seen a year of stagnation and more people out of work than since the last Conservative government in 1992.\" The chancellor will fly to Brussels this week to meet fellow European finance ministers as they battle to shore up the single currency. Financial markets have become increasingly confident that the euro can muddle through after the European Central Bank lent more than \u20ac500bn in emergency cash to struggling banks. Resolution's research is part of a larger report, Squeezed Britain, detailing the pressures on low- and middle-income households. It will be launched tomorrow at an event with shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne, and the Liberal Democrat MP and former chief secretary David Laws. The latest inflation figures, released last week, fell to a six-month low of 4.2% in November, raising hopes that the squeeze on households' buying power will start to ease in the coming months. Ben Broadbent, an independent member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting monetary policy committee, said on Friday that the economy was \"broadly flat\", with the biggest risks coming \"overwhelmingly from continental Europe\".",

      "bodyText": "Even for the 51 weeks a year when Davos is just another ski resort, Switzerland is renowned as a haven for multimillionaires in search of a quiet life \u2013 and a minimal tax bill. Lewis Hamilton and Phil Collins are among the Brits who have chosen to flee to the Alpine state to avoid the scrutiny of the Revenue. But tax havens, where few questions are asked about residents' financial affairs, have come under increasing international pressure to change their ways in recent years. The resignation of Swiss central bank governor Philipp Hildebrand earlier this month, after his wealthy wife caused controversy by betting against the Swiss franc, showed that the country has become less tolerant of the idea that the financial affairs of the super-rich should be secret. The UK and German treasuries have both recently signed agreements with the Swiss government under which their citizens will have to pay up for salting their money away in secretive accounts in Zurich or Geneva \u2013 though the European commission is currently challenging the deals, which have not yet been signed into law. Criticism of the Swiss authorities' approach intensified after a celebrated case starting in 2010, in which a whistleblower at HSBC released the financial details of scores of the bank's private clients, allowing the French, German and UK authorities to pursue them for unpaid tax. More recently, the Swiss government has proposed abolishing so-called \"lump sum taxation\", under which wealthy individuals can offer to pay a flat fee up front in exchange for avoiding any scrutiny of their financial affairs by the authorities. Swiss finance minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said last summer when the idea was announced that revenue could double, although she acknowledged that some taxpayers might decide to leave rather than submit to closer examination of their affairs. \"We have to realistically reckon with people leaving, but we do not think it will be a huge number,\" she said. However, the plan has not yet come into force. At the same time, a group of leftwing campaigners is promoting the idea of a referendum on imposing a federal inheritance tax for the first time, as well as a levy on financial gifts. The proposals are unlikely to be voted on until next year but could be enforced retrospectively to cover any gifts made from this month. However, Richard Murphy of the Tax Justice Network said it would be a mistake to see these straws in the wind as evidence that Switzerland is shrugging off its secretive status. \"It's clearly still a tax haven, and most wealthy people if they wanted to could still put their money there, no questions asked,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p>Even for the 51 weeks a year when Davos is just another ski resort, Switzerland is renowned as a haven for multimillionaires in search of a quiet life \u2013 and a minimal tax bill. Lewis Hamilton and Phil Collins are among the Brits who have chosen to flee to the Alpine state to avoid the scrutiny of the Revenue.</p> <p>But tax havens, where few questions are asked about residents' financial affairs, have come under increasing international pressure to change their ways in recent years.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/09/switzerland-snb-swiss-national-bank\" title=\"\">resignation of Swiss central bank governor Philipp Hildebrand</a> earlier this month, after his wealthy wife caused controversy by betting against the Swiss franc, showed that the country has become less tolerant of the idea that the financial affairs of the super-rich should be secret.</p> <p>The UK and German treasuries have both recently signed agreements with the Swiss government under which their citizens will have to pay up for salting their money away in secretive accounts in Zurich or Geneva \u2013 though the European commission is currently challenging the deals, which have not yet been signed into law.</p> <p>Criticism of the Swiss authorities' approach intensified after a celebrated case starting in 2010, in which a whistleblower at HSBC released the financial details of scores of the bank's private clients, allowing the French, German and UK authorities to pursue them for unpaid tax.</p> <p>More recently, the Swiss government has proposed abolishing so-called \"lump sum taxation\", under which wealthy individuals can offer to pay a flat fee up front in exchange for avoiding any scrutiny of their financial affairs by the authorities.</p> <p>Swiss finance minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said last summer when the idea was announced that revenue could double, although she acknowledged that some taxpayers might decide to leave rather than submit to closer examination of their affairs. \"We have to realistically reckon with people leaving, but we do not think it will be a huge number,\" she said. However, the plan has not yet come into force.</p> <p>At the same time, a group of leftwing campaigners is promoting the idea of a referendum on imposing a federal inheritance tax for the first time, as well as a levy on financial gifts. The proposals are unlikely to be voted on until next year but could be enforced retrospectively to cover any gifts made from this month.</p> <p>However, Richard Murphy of the Tax Justice Network said it would be a mistake to see these straws in the wind as evidence that Switzerland is shrugging off its secretive status. \"It's clearly still a tax haven, and most wealthy people if they wanted to could still put their money there, no questions asked,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The moral high ground seems to be getting very crowded lately. Ed Miliband made reforming capitalism the centrepiece of his Labour party conference speech; Nick Clegg has argued for a \"John Lewis economy\"; and on Friday the prime minister joined them, laying claim to a distinctive Conservative doctrine of \"popular capitalism\". Cameron's speech was clever: the argument that Labour had struck a \"Faustian pact\" with the City, allowing finance to let rip while milking it for tax revenues, has more than a grain of truth in it. Building his current enthusiasm for making markets work better into a longer-term political narrative that took in the emancipation of slaves and the abolition of the Corn Laws was also shrewd. Conservatives understand how the markets work, he implied, so they know how to tame them; Labour was naive enough to be taken in by the myth that the City could regulate itself last time around \u2013 so you can't trust them to remodel the system now. And by laying out a series of measures (albeit that few of them were new), from simplifying the laws on co-operatives to controlling bankers' bonuses, he tried to show that unlike Miliband, whose conference speech was long on righteous fury and short on concrete policy, he can translate disquiet about how the system works into action. But Cameron should be measured not by what he did say, but what he didn't. There was little mention of the tax system, aside from George Osborne's welcome consultation on anti-tax-abuse rules. Yet taxation frames the economy. It rewards some activities (saving for a pension, for example) and punishes others (smoking). The influx of American traders, Russian oligarchs and Greek shipping magnates to London over the past 20 years wasn't just driven by our lax regulatory regime or the standard of the cooking in Mayfair's finest eateries: it also helps that many of them could claim \"non-domicile\" tax status by virtue of being born abroad, and pay nothing on their income from overseas \u2013 which, if they arranged their affairs right, meant almost all of it. To be fair, it was George Osborne who first mooted the idea of charging non-doms an annual levy \u2013 a proposal swiftly picked up by Alistair Darling \u2013 and more than 130,000 wealthy individuals have since signed up to register as non-doms. But the problems arising from taxation do not end there. The frenzy of private equity deals that swept through the economy in the noughties was partly because interest rates were unusually low; but it also reflected the structure of the tax system. Companies can claim back debt repayments against their corporate tax bill. That means the \"leveraged buyout\" \u2013 gobbling up a firm using a loan which the firm itself will then have to repay \u2013 has an inbuilt financial advantage over a straight takeover. As the recent fortunes of a string of companies that were loaded up with debt in the good years, from Punch Taverns to Peacocks to EMI, has shown, this approach can leave a firm \u2013 and the jobs of its unwitting workers \u2013 highly vulnerable if the economy turns sour. It's not good for the economy, or society \u2013 yet it's privileged in the tax system. As for private equity managers themselves, just like hedge fund managers, they pay embarrassingly low tax rates. They receive a management fee (traditionally 2% of the funds invested) plus up to 20% of the profits generated by companies in their portfolios, an arrangement known as \"carried interest\". That profit share is treated by HM Revenue &amp; Customs as a capital gain, not the boring old income that the rest of us earn. And that means it's taxed much more lightly \u2013 at 18p, compared to the 50p top rate. The overarching logic is that investors who are willing to jeopardise their livelihoods by taking a stake in a risky start-up, or founding a business, should be taxed more lightly than mere wage-slaves who turn up in the morning and clock off at night. In Thatcherite parlance, they're \"wealth creators\". But if all they've done is leverage a company up to the hilt, implement a ruthless cost-cutting programme (ie taken an axe to the workforce) and then put it up for sale, why should they be given advantages? Even in the US, where multibillionaires have traditionally been treated with less suspicion than on this side of the Atlantic, there has been a wave of outrage about Mitt Romney's admission that he pays a tax rate of just 15% on his multimillion-dollar fortune \u2013 and, according to some reports, little or nothing on the large proportion of it salted away in the Cayman Islands. And tax is just the start. A genuine, thoroughgoing re-examination of the way capitalism works in the UK would extend far beyond the question of whether staff should be handed a few more shares, or supine fund managers given the right to vote down the eye-watering pay deals that few of them saw fit to oppose during the boom years. It's now for Miliband to prove that he has more than a bit of high-flown rhetoric and tinkering around the edges in mind. As Philip Booth of the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs frostily remarked after Cameron's speech, \"nobody wants to see a less moral capitalism\".",

    "webTitle": "Pensions anger as even profitable firms cut benefits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Unilever, the maker of everything from Pot Noodles to Dove soap, has infuriated its staff by cutting pension payouts \u2013 despite being highly profitable. Shell, another household name, has followed suit with plans to cut retirement incomes. Unilever suffered a wave of strikes which started last week and will continue for the next five days. Much of the anger among employees at its factories and research units is focused on the company's \u00a36bn operating profit and the pay, bonus and pension top-ups awarded to chief executive Paul Polman. He pocketed \u00a32.8m last year, of which \u00a31.7m was a performance-related bonus. His pension was increased by a company donation of \u00a3352,000, according to the 2011 annual report. For staff, it is a typical them-and-us story of sky-high rewards for directors while shopfloor workers are bullied into accepting reduced standards of living. The changes to pension scheme rules are the flashpoint. However, a closer look at the changes makes it harder to characterise as a poor deal. In 2008, Unilever made its first move to save costs, but refused to push new staff into the default arrangements adoped by other companies, which rely on stock market investments and put all the risk of generating a retirement income on to the employee. The board said new joiners would receive a pension based on their career-average earnings. It thus maintained the scheme, and effectively guaranteed a maximum cut of only 20% to pension payouts, while rivals were devising schemes for new staff that would mean losses of 60% at least. Last year Unilever told staff that the costs of providing a pension had soared following a rise in life expectancy, poor investment returns and the threat from more costly regulations. It meant all staff, not just new joiners, needed to move to the new career-average scheme. Unions are well aware of the rising costs of pension provision. Average life expectancy is 80, up from 72 in the 1970s, according to professor David Leon of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's epidemiology unit. He says it is likely to carry on rising as more people stop smoking and eat healthily, though increasing obesity and diabetes could reverse the effect. According to the Office for National Statistics, between 2004-06 and 2008-10 average life expectancy for women rose by a year to 82.3, while for men it rose by 1.2 years to 78.2. Poor investment returns are the other side of the equation, after a decade of low interest rates and underperforming stock markets. The index of Britain's top 100 companies declined 5.5% last year. In fact, growth in most schemes over the past 10 years has been simply a result of employee and employer contributions. Investment gains, such as they are, have struggled to keep pace with inflation. Firms also face extra regulatory costs because of European Union plans to categorise occupational pension schemes as insurance vehicles. This will mean they must boost their funding position, something they can only do at their own expense. Unions also know that the biggest losers from the shift away from final-salary benefits are middle managers on higher pay. Those at the top have risen through the ranks to a much higher salary than the one they started on. A career-average scheme takes into account income levels during the early years of a career and can drag down the total. Then there is the question of Polman's pension contribution from the company, which amounts to a third of his \u00a31m base salary. It seems a high figure until pension analysts point out that most employees over 50 in a final-salary scheme will enjoy a pension contribution of at least a third of their salary. One of the main unions in the Unilever battle, Usdaw, supports Tesco's career-average scheme. And the deal it signed meant all staff foregoing their existing final-salary benefits. Unilever will protect all previous commitments. Shell, on the other hand, is representative of most FTSE 100 firms. It plans to direct new employees into a stock market-related scheme while retaining a final-salary option for existing employees. This is the traditional solution of finance directors, who have disliked the unlimited liability and rising costs of final-salary pension schemes since the mid-1990s. The banks were the first to ditch their final-salary commitments. In the stock market crash of 2003, almost all the 7,000 remaining firms with final-salary schemes shut them, though, like Shell, only to new members. This created a two-tier workforce inside many companies, something which unions felt obliged to ignore. Some workplaces took a stand against the shift to retaining final-salary benefits for existing workers and stock-market plans for new staff but, outside the public sector, these campaigns fizzled out. The UK now has an ageing group of about 2 million employees working towards retirement with their final-salary benefits intact. Another 16-18 million have some of their working life covered by a final-salary scheme. But the bulk of contributions for 20 million workers with a pension are in the new stock-market schemes that account for 88% of all current contributions, according to pension advisers Towers Watson. Final-salary schemes usually guarantee to provide a retirement income after 40 years' service worth two-thirds of a worker's final pay cheque. With a stock market-invested pension it is a very different picture. For many people it has meant getting back little more than was put in, despite the stock market having more than doubled its value in 20 years. The result is a pension worth no more than a fifth of final salary. Fund managers, who are often blamed for siphoning off much of the investment gain in pension schemes to pay their commissions and fees, are unlikely to make much progress in the next few years of recession and lacklustre growth across the developed world. This will only lead to smaller payouts from the new breed of cheaper scheme. In this environment, strikes against businesses such as Unilever that continue to offer generous guarantees could become harder to justify.",

For many people it has meant getting back little more than was put in, despite the stock market having more than doubled its value in 20 years. The result is a pension worth no more than a fifth of final salary.</p> <p>Fund managers, who are often blamed for siphoning off much of the investment gain in pension schemes to pay their commissions and fees, are unlikely to make much progress in the next few years of recession and lacklustre growth across the developed world. This will only lead to smaller payouts from the new breed of cheaper scheme. In this environment, strikes against businesses such as Unilever that continue to offer generous guarantees could become harder to justify.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Heavy snow is forecast for the high Alps this week when the global elite gathers for its annual shindig in Davos. The blizzard may cover up the architectural blemishes of the unprepossessing Swiss town, but it will be unable to hide the fault lines in the global economy. The agenda is a full one, with the mood one of caution and some trepidation. Slowing growth, financial fragility, governments teetering on the brink of insolvency and default, and clear signs of a public backlash against the excesses of the rich and powerful: all have created a sombre backdrop to the invitation-only affair. So if you are not packing your ski boots in anticipation of rubbing shoulders with Bob Diamond or George Osborne, here is your A to Z guide to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. A is for anti-globalisation Davos is the Glastonbury of globalisation, the event that attracts all the movers and shakers of the world economy. For one week in January it contains more billionaires per square kilometre than any place on earth and, unsurprisingly, attracts the attention of the anti-globalisation movement. This year the protests will be centred on an igloo, which will be home to Occupy the World Economic Forum. The Swiss authorities tend to take a tough line with protesters \u2013 and even innocent bystanders. Last year Andrew Clark, then Observer business editor, was arrested on a train on his way back from Davos. B is for Belvedere During the day the action in Davos is focused on the conference centre, an ugly 1970s building which has recently been modernised and extended. After hours, members of the WEF normally repair to the Belvedere, the hotel where all the best parties are held and where many of the dignitaries stay. Hotels in Davos week are eye-wateringly expensive: a bog-standard, chalet-style room costs 400-500 Swiss francs (\u00a3275-\u00a3345) a night, with a five-night minimum stay. C is for Cameron The prime minister is one of close to 40 heads of state or government expected to show up for this year's talkfest. An experienced Davos hand, Cameron first came to the event as opposition leader, but will deliver one of the keynote addresses this year. Gordon Brown and Tony Blair are also both on the list of participants. D is for Doha Each year trade ministers gather in Davos for talks aimed at breathing new life into the moribund Doha trade liberalisation talks. Each year they fail. E is for Europe This year's hot topic is the crisis in the eurozone, which is casting a shadow over the entire global economy. Expect lots of sermons from the Chinese, the Americans and the Brits about the need for Europe to \"get its act together\" and warm words from European policymakers about how the worst of the crisis is now over. F is for fondue Getting the authentic taste of Swiss cuisine in Davos is surprisingly difficult, with most of the hotels serving identical international fare. Those in the know head for the Gentiana, where George Osborne dined last year with Angel Gurr\u00eda, head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. G is for Gates Since handing over control of Microsoft, Bill Gates has devoted himself to philanthropy and will use Davos as a platform to call for the use of innovative sources of finance, such as a financial transaction tax, to fund development. H is for Hungary The attention over the past year has been on Europe's soft southern underbelly \u2013 Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain. In the past few weeks, the crisis has spread east to the former communist country, which was badly burned by the global financial crisis. An International Monetary Fund programme is imminent and Hungary's plight will be much discussed. I is for Igwel Davos is organised around a series of themed sessions in which panels of experts give their views on the issues of the moment. Behind the scenes, world leaders are encouraged to talk more freely at \"Igwels\" \u2013 informal gatherings of world economic leaders. This is supposed to be where the business of Davos is done, although the real deal-making takes place in one-on-one clandestine meetings. J is for Johnson It is a mayoral election year in London, so Boris will be in town to bang the drum for his new airport, dish the dirt on Ken Livingstone and tell the world about how wonderful the Olympics will be. Only the mischievous would say he will be trying to upstage the prime minister. K is for Klosters A 15-minute spin down the mountain by minibus or limo, Klosters has become the overspill town for those who can't find rooms in Davos or who prefer to spend more time on the ski slopes than in the conference centre. L is for Lagarde This will be Christine Lagarde's first meeting as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. She has plenty on her to-do list: preventing the break-up of the euro, addressing the state of the global economy and making sure the fund has enough money to provide help to countries that need it. M is for Merkel Each year Davos is kicked off with a big speech by a prominent world leader and this year it is Angela Merkel's turn. Germany's pivotal role in resolving the eurozone crisis means her words will be carefully scrutinised by the financial markets. N is for non-governmental organisations There was a time in the 1990s when Davos was the exclusive preserve of politicians, business folk and academics. Development was not on the agenda and trade unionists were not permitted inside the conference centre. These days the WEF prides itself on making the event more inclusive, extending invitations to charities such as Oxfam and One, founded by Bono. The U2 singer has become a Davos fixture but will not be there this year. O is for off-piste The bread and butter of Davos are the sessions on economics, business and finance, but the WEF prides itself on its array of off-piste sessions, in which members can keep up to speed with the latest developments in neuroscience, quantum physics, astronomy, music, architecture and literature. For many participants these are the most enjoyable bits of the week. P is for Pandit Each Davos meeting has a number of co-chairs drawn from the business community, which pays royally for the privilege. Vikram Pandit, chief executive officer of Citigroup, is one of this year's six co-chairs. The others are Yasuchika Hasegawa, chief executive of Takeda Pharmaceutical; Paul Polman, Unilever's boss; Peter Voser, chief of Royal Dutch Shell; Alejandro Ram\u00edrez, boss of the Mexican cinema chain Cin\u00e9polis; and, to redress the gender balance somewhat, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer. Q is for queue Unless you are a head of state, there is no escaping the long lines to get into the conference centre \u2013 and the Belvedere \u2013 at peak times of the day. It gets quite parky in January, especially when it snows, so take a nice warm coat. R is for Roubini Back in 2007, Nouriel Roubini was one of the few economists to see the global crash coming. Dr Doom, as he has come to be known will set the tone on Wednesday in a session called The Seeds of Dystopia. Not one for the faint-hearted. S is for Schwab Klaus Schwab has been Mr Davos since founding the WEF in 1971 with the motto \"committed to improving the state of the world\". Schwab, who was born in Germany in 1938, said last week that capitalism, in its current form, \"no longer fits the world around us\". T is for trophy wives Normally accompanying American tycoons, the TWs are easy to spot in Davos. They are the ones with the highest heels, the big hair, the real fur coats and the hints of expensive cosmetic surgery. U is for United States As ever, there will be plenty of American businessmen on parade at the forum, since they like a few days' R&amp;R in the Alps. But it is a presidential election year, so US politicians will be thin on the ground. Tim Geithner, the treasury secretary, is the biggest name on the attendance list. V is for valley Davos nestles in a valley high in the mountains. First inhabited in the middle ages, from the 19th century it became a popular destination for those suffering from tuberculosis because doctors thought the air was good for their patients \u2013 including Thomas Mann, whose novel The Magic Mountain is set in Davos. W is for women Reflecting life in the boardroom, Davos has tended to be a male-dominated affair. The WEF is promising to do better this year. X is for Zhang Xiaoqiang The deputy director of China's national development and reform commission is part of Beijing's increasingly influential Davos team. Given the growing importance of emerging countries in the global economy, there has been a subtle shift at the annual meeting. Once western leaders used to lecture developing countries: now it is the other way around. Y is for York That's his royal highness the Duke of York to you. Prince Andrew turns up in Davos every year to promote Britain's exports. Z is for Zoellick Having fallen out with Barack Obama, it appears unlikely that Robert Zoellick will seek a second term as World Bank president when his first runs out in July. Rumours have it that he will announce his decision in Davos this week.",
