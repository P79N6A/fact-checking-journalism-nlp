      "body": "<p>Oil prices above $200 a barrel. Energy shortages in western Europe. The return of recession to the still-fragile global economy. A slump in Russia. That's the fear haunting policymakers as they contemplate how to respond to the shooting down of MH17 over eastern Ukraine last week.</p> <p>The meltdown scenario can be easily sketched out. Every global downturn since 1973 has been associated with a sharp rise in the price of energy. Russia is one of the world's biggest energy suppliers and is responsible for about one-third of Europe's gas. America's economic recovery from the deep recession of 2008-09 has been weak by historic standards, while the European Union's has barely got going. From the car plants of Germany to the finance houses of the City of London and French defence firms, there has been pressure on politicians to be wary of provoking Vladimir Putin into retaliation that might rebound on the west.</p> <p>\"The possible involvement of Russian-backed separatists in the airliner's destruction has raised the risk of further sanctions against Russia by the international community,\" says Adam Slater, senior economist at Oxford Economics. \"These would further damage Russia's economy. Russia's next moves remain uncertain but an escalation of the conflict is still a significant risk which would have potentially negative global spillovers in particular via the impact on global energy markets.\"</p> <p>The extent of that economic damage depends on two factors: how tough the west gets and how Russia responds.</p> <p>Given the public outrage at the loss of life on MH17 some increase in the severity of the sanctions looks inevitable. In Brusselson Tuesday, there was talk of imposing restrictions on capital movements from Russia and of curbs on exports of defence and energy technology. These measures would certainly increase the pain for Russia, and would run the risk that Putin would retaliate by choking off oil and gas exports to the west, looking instead to energy-hungry China as an alternative market. Slater estimates that UK growth next year would be 1% lower than expected were Russia to halt gas supplies through Ukraine, with the impact felt through higher energy prices, higher inflation, falling share prices and weaker consumer confidence. Closing the gas taps could then trigger the \"phase three sanctions\" being resisted by many EU countries, including Germany, France and Italy. These would target entire sectors of the Russian economy, blocking their exports to the west and preventing them doing business with companies in the European Union and North America.</p> <p>It is this prospect that has prompted fears of rapidly rising oil prices. Slater calculates that Russian energy exports to the rest of the world could be cut by as much as 80%, with less than half the shortfall made up by the Opec oil cartel. \"In such a scenario, world oil prices could soar above $200 per barrel and gas prices would also rise steeply.\"</p> <p>Julian Jessop at Capital Economics notes that the biggest losers from this would be Russia, already in recession. Other suppliers would have an incentive to keep prices low in order to grab Russia's energy customers. The west could draw down on strategic oil supplies to limit the impact of the loss of Russian supply.</p> <p>It is the potential for Russia to damage the west and for the west to cause even more damage to Russia that explains the belief that the crisis will not escalate into a full-scale economic war. The European Union will talk tough but fall shy of imposing wide-ranging financial and trade sanctions as punishment for the Kremlin's alleged role in the attack on the Malaysia Airlines jet. Meanwhile, hopes that Putin is putting pressure on the separatists in Ukraine boosted share prices.</p> <p>But events of a century ago show that the optimism of markets is not always to be trusted. It was only in the last week of July 1914 \u2013 once Austria-Hungary had delivered its ultimatum to Serbia \u2013 that bourses woke up to the fact that the assassination in Sarajevo had the potential to lead to a war involving all the great European powers. Up until then, the death of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was seen as merely a local affair and nothing to worry about. Similarly, the expectation now is that Europe will huff and puff but be wary of provoking Putin. For his part, the Russian president will be aware of the economic damage that even limited sanctions are doing and so be inclined to put quiet pressure on the rebels in the Ukraine to co-operate with the international investigation at the crash site. Russia's economy was already contracting before the west imposed its most recent set of sanctions in the spring. The fear now is that things could unravel quickly \u2013 just as they did in 1914.</p> <h2><strong>Germany</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Imports from Russia \u20ac38bn (\u00a330bn) Exports to Russia \u20ac36bn </strong>Germany is by far Russia's largest trading partner in Europe, while 6,000 German firms have set up shop in the country. Business lobby groups anxious to protect the country's lucrative exports of machine tools, cars and chemicals have claimed Germany would suffer \"irreparable damage\", losing its dominant economic position to China if sanctions escalate. The Committee on Eastern European Relations estimates that German exports to Russia and Ukraine are on course to shrink by \u20ac6bn in 2014 and claims 25,000 people will lose their jobs if these companies do not find alternative export markets.</p> <h2><strong>France</strong> </h2> <p><strong>Imports \u20ac10.3bn Exports \u20ac 7.7bn</strong></p> <p>In 2008 the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, thrust himself into the centre of attempts to broker a peace between Russia and Georgia after a short war that saw Georgia crushed. Less than three years later, Sarkozy signed a contract to sell Russia two Mistral warships, below, that could have been used to defeat Georgia \"in 40 minutes\", according to a Russian naval commander. The \u20ac1.2bn deal \u2013 the Russian military's first major foreign arms purchase in modern history \u2013 supports 1,000 jobs in the French shipbuilding and defence industries, but France is now under heavy pressure not to deliver the second ship. French banks are also heavily exposed to Russia and could be vulnerable if Russian companies are unable to repay debts in the wake of tighter financial sanctions.</p> <h2><strong>UK</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Imports \u20ac8bn</strong> <strong>Exports</strong> <strong>\u20ac4.6bn</strong></p> <p>Russian billionaires' love of London houses and English football clubs is well known, but the UK may be less affected by a freeze in economic relations with Russia than generally thought. Just 1% of the UK's \u00a3118bn exports in financial services \u2013 lawyers' and bankers' bills \u2013 go to Russia, although this figure understates the money cycled back through UK offshore centres, such as the British Virgin Islands. UK banks have also lent generously to Russian companies, with $19bn flowing to Russia in 2013. More than 50 Russian companies are listed the main London stock exchange, but the number of companies seeking a listing has dropped sharply since the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <h2><strong>Netherlands</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Imports \u20ac29bn Exports \u20ac8bn</strong></p> <p>The economically liberal Dutch are one of Russia's most important trading partners.

These countries are most vulnerable if Russia retaliates against tougher sanctions by turning off its gas supplies. Hungary, which is 80% dependent on Russian gas, could find a controversial deal it signed with Russia in February to build two nuclear reactors coming under the spotlight.</p> <h2><strong>Southern Europe</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Italy: Imports \u20ac20bn Exports \u20ac10.8bn </strong></p> <p>Italy's economy minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, said on Tuesday that Europe's economy was weaker than expected and sanctions could be a problem for all sides.

      "bodyText": "Allegations about the way Royal Bank of Scotland treats its small businesses have resurfaced after senior executives from the bailed-out bank were accused of being \"wilfully obtuse\" when giving evidence to MPs. Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury select committee, issued a damning verdict on the evidence provided last month by two of the most senior directors of the 81% taxpayer-owned bank, which has been scrambling to defend its stance towards small business customers. Chris Sullivan, deputy chief executive of RBS, was forced to write to Tyrie to clarify evidence given last month by himself and Derek Sach, who runs the global restructuring group (GRG) at the centre of the controversy. GRG has been the focus of allegations \u2013 notably by Lawrence Tomlinson, an adviser to the business secretary, Vince Cable \u2013 that it forces viable small businesses to the brink so that the bank can buy up their properties and make a profit. When the two executives gave evidence in June they denied GRG was run as a profit centre, but in his letter Sullivan admitted that on an accounting basis the operation was run this way. This prompted an angry reaction from Tyrie, a Conservative MP. \"RBS has now offered the committee what it euphemistically describes as 'additional comments',\" he said. \"In fact, they have done a belated U-turn. It's not as if the facts have changed. So it now appears that RBS has been wilfully obtuse with the committee. \"If this is how RBS deals with a parliamentary committee, how much can customers and regulators rely on it to be straightforward with them?\" The description of the GRG unit as a profit centre was made in a report commissioned by RBS from Sir Andrew Large, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, who warned that there could be potential or perceived conflicts of interest because GRG is an internal profit centre which could also demand that troubled small businesses in the lending divisions be transferred to its operations. Tomlinson also compiled a report last year alleging that GRG was deliberately wrecking viable small businesses to make profits for the bank. Tomlinson, Cable's entrepreneur in residence, argued that small businesses ended up in GRG and then had their properties sold to the bank's property arm, West Register, making a profit for the bank. RBS has since pledged to shut the contentious West Register unit which owns more than 1,300 houses and flats as well as other properties such as care homes, pubs and hotels and was set up in the 1990s recession. In his letter Sullivan, who is leaving RBS next year, also had to clarify remarks made by himself and Sach that they had not seen a report commissioned by the bank into the Tomlinson allegations. Sullivan wrote: \"I need to correct the statement I made to the committee that I did not see a draft of the report, as on further checking with my office I can confirm I was in receipt of a copy during this period and made some comments of a typographical nature. Mr Derek Sach was also given sight of a copy of the report.\" Sullivan said the bank did not disagree with the description of GRG being a profit centre, which he said was an accounting term. \"What Mr Sach and I were taking issue with is the way others have used Sir Andrew's report to suggest that GRG had a profit motive with a prejudice against our customers, rather than a turnaround motive. Indeed, as Mr Sach pointed out in his evidence, far from making any profit for the bank, GRG has recorded a substantial loss over recent years,\" he said. The GRG division is being scrutinised by the City regulator.",

      "bodyText": "\"Spend a little, save a little, life will be OK.\" Manal Chaib, 13, reads out her \"money promise\" tweet to the rest of the class. \"I want to spend so bad,\" reads out another pupil. A year-eight class at Heartlands High School in north London get a taste of lessons in the English national curriculum when secondary schools return from the summer break. With the introduction of financial education, 11- to 16-year-olds will solve money related maths problems and learn about public finances, pensions and how to budget. In the wake of the debt-fuelled financial crisis charities lobbied hard for this change. In the classroom at Heartlands High School, pupils have mixed feelings. \"It's probably as important as English and business studies,\" says Karim Blake. Chaib is worried about too much focus on saving. \"We are teenagers. We should be able to spend on what we want. You should start worrying when you are 16 ... I don't want to get: 'You are going to have a rubbish future.'\" Gabby Urbonaviciute is also unsure. \"If it was for the whole time, I think it would get boring. Today is fun. Two lessons but not more than that,\" she says while filling in a quiz on which celebrity spender she is most like \u2013 from \"super saver\" J K Rowling to \"spenderholic\" Mike Tyson. This workshop is being run by MyBnk. Set up in 2007 it has so far helped 80,000 children with lessons on the difference between \"needs and wants\", how to save, public spending, banking and enterprise. Founder Lily Lapenna started the charity after working in international development in Africa and Asia. When she returned to London it was the calm before the great financial storm but Lapenna was already nervous about the build-up of personal debt. \"Credit flowed quickly and easily \u2013 overdrafts, credit cards and mortgages. Many of my friends were in debt but living fabulously without a clue of what APR meant nor how it impacted them,\" she says, referring to the annual percentage rate (APR) measure of how much it costs to borrow money. \"Something didn't feel right. Sure, we could pay our monthly bills, but what if we lost our job, what would we do if our boiler packed up?\" She started classes for schoolchildren and since the onset of the financial crisis, demand for MyBnk's sessions has soared. \"We need to teach students to manage money. That was not the prevailing attitude pre-crash where thoughts were, they will learn from their parents,\" says Lapenna. \"Demand has skyrocketed ... Next year we are targeting a doubling of our reach to 40,000 young people.\" Since changes to the national curriculum were announced last November the charity has been providing classes that fit the new guidelines and anticipates even more demand from September. Under the changes, lessons in budgeting and public spending will be taught in citizenship and financial equations will be part of maths teaching. There are doubts about whether the curriculum requirements go far enough and whether teachers will be well enough supported. But those who campaigned for financial education in schools have broadly welcomed the change. Tope Chiedozie, an education officer for MyBnk, says such lessons are vital to help children understand basic concepts about earning, saving and spending before they leave home. He also wants them to gain skills they can put to use straight away. \"Many schools have chicken and chip shops and newsagents nearby. When you look at their budgets and what they spend in a week it's scary. Some of them are given \u00a320 on Monday and on Tuesday have \u00a32,\" he says. At schools in more affluent areas the challenge is teaching children about the value of money, says Chiedozie. \"Some kids I ask: Have you got a mobile phone, have you got a laptop, an iPad, a computer, a TV in your room?' Some have all of them. Overindulgence like that doesn't help the money in their hand have any value at all.\" Rhiannon Colvin, another trainer with MyBnk says financial education is as much about young people understanding the public finances as their own personal finances. \"I hope that they are empowered with the knowledge to make their own decisions and to have more say in how the economy works,\" she says. One thing that stands out wherever she runs sessions, says Colvin, is an entrenched view about how the government spends its money. \"They are saying things like (money goes) to benefit scroungers. When you ask them what the government spends its money on you'd think that the first thing they would say is schools or hospitals but they say people who are not working. Those media messages filter down.\" Freddie Ewer co-founder of the financial education group RedStart says new teaching in the area must work towards changing attitudes in the UK. \"This has a huge role to play in ensuring we don't end up with another huge debt driven financial crisis,\" he says. RedStart, spun out of a pensions adviser, is also seeing rising demand from schools for its sessions. It is recruiting companies in the financial sector to host and teach the workshops. \"I think the financial crisis has brought a shift in financial responsibility away from government and big business to individuals, for example, in pensions, tuition fees, increasing use of private healthcare. If you are going to put all this responsibility on the shoulders of people you need to have an education system that explains to them at a young age how basic financial concepts work,\" says Ewer. There are worries that the national curriculum changes will leave many children behind. MyBnk points out there are still no compulsory financial lessons for anyone over 16, when they may be facing big financial decisions. Also, academies and free schools can opt out of teaching the national curriculum. Teachers themselves will need training or outside help, say charities. \"A lot of these people who are being asked to teach financial education have never been taught it themselves,\" says RedStart's Ewer. The deputy head at Heartlands, Alice Clay, is hopeful that given her school has included financial education in classes for some time, the new term will not bring a significant shift. But she expects some areas of the new curriculum to be more challenging than others. \"The children are really interested in the enterprise part of things and business planning. We have to work harder to keep them interested in personal finance issues,\" she says. Adult habits Campaigners for financial education say the government must not stop at September's changes to the national curriculum. Cambridge University research suggests adult money habits are set in by the time children are seven. The charity Personal Finance Education Group (Pfeg) wants financial education extended to all primary schools, including academies and free schools not bound to follow the national curriculum. About 90% of teachers do not believe the government has done enough in introducing financial education into secondary schools, according to a recent survey from Pfeg. More than 80% said financial education must begin in primary school. The Cambridge University study, published by the Money Advice Service, found that by the age of seven most children have grasped how to recognise the value of money and to count it out, how money can be exchanged for goods, and what it means to earn money.",

      "body": "<p>\"Spend a little, save a little, life will be OK.\" Manal Chaib, 13, reads out her \"money promise\" tweet to the rest of the class. \"I want to spend so bad,\" reads out another pupil.</p> <p>A year-eight class at <a href=\"http://heartlands.haringey.sch.uk/\" title=\"\">Heartlands High School</a> in north London get a taste of lessons in the English national curriculum when secondary schools return from the summer break. With the introduction of financial education, 11- to 16-year-olds will solve money related maths problems and learn about public finances, pensions and how to budget.</p> <p>In the wake of the debt-fuelled financial crisis charities lobbied hard for this change. In the classroom at Heartlands High School, pupils have mixed feelings.</p> <p>\"It's probably as important as English and business studies,\" says Karim Blake.</p> <p>Chaib is worried about too much focus on saving. \"We are teenagers. We should be able to spend on what we want. You should start worrying when you are 16&#xa0;... I don't want to get: 'You are going to have a rubbish future.'\"</p> <p>Gabby Urbonaviciute is also unsure. \"If it was for the whole time, I think it would get boring. Today is fun. Two lessons but not more than that,\" she says while filling in a quiz on which celebrity spender she is most like \u2013 from \"super saver\" J K Rowling to \"spenderholic\" Mike Tyson.</p> <p>This workshop is being run by <a href=\"http://mybnk.org/\" title=\"\">MyBnk</a>. Set up in 2007 it has so far helped 80,000 children with lessons on the difference between \"needs and wants\", how to save, public spending, banking and enterprise.</p> <p>Founder Lily Lapenna started the charity after working in international development in Africa and Asia. When she returned to London it was the calm before the great financial storm but Lapenna was already nervous about the build-up of personal debt.</p> <p>\"Credit flowed quickly and easily \u2013 overdrafts, credit cards and mortgages. Many of my friends were in debt but living fabulously without a clue of what APR meant nor how it impacted them,\" she says, referring to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/oct/25/debt.savings\" title=\"\">annual percentage rate</a> (APR) measure of how much it costs to borrow money. \"Something didn't feel right. Sure, we could pay our monthly bills, but what if we lost our job, what would we do if our boiler packed up?\"</p> <p>She started classes for schoolchildren and since the onset of the financial crisis, demand for MyBnk's sessions has soared. \"We need to teach students to manage money. That was not the prevailing attitude pre-crash where thoughts were, they will learn from their parents,\" says Lapenna.</p> <p>\"Demand has skyrocketed&#xa0;... Next year we are targeting a doubling of our reach to 40,000 young people.\"</p> <p>Since changes to the national curriculum were announced last November the charity has been providing classes that fit the new guidelines and anticipates even more demand from September. Under the changes, lessons in budgeting and public spending will be taught in citizenship and financial equations will be part of maths teaching.</p> <p>There are <a href=\"http://mybnk.org/work-to-do-financial-education-in-national-curriculum-2014/\" title=\"MyBnk\">doubts about whether the curriculum requirements go far enough</a> and whether teachers will be well enough supported. But those who campaigned for financial education in schools have broadly welcomed the change.</p> <p>Tope Chiedozie, an education officer for MyBnk, says such lessons are vital to help children understand basic concepts about earning, saving and spending before they leave home. He also wants them to gain skills they can put to use straight away. \"Many schools have chicken and chip shops and newsagents nearby. When you look at their budgets and what they spend in a week it's scary. Some of them are given \u00a320 on Monday and on Tuesday have \u00a32,\" he says.</p> <p>At schools in more affluent areas the challenge is teaching children about the value of money, says Chiedozie.</p> <p>\"Some kids I ask: Have you got a mobile phone, have you got a laptop, an iPad, a computer, a TV in your room?' Some have all of them. Overindulgence like that doesn't help the money in their hand have any value at all.\"</p> <p>Rhiannon Colvin, another trainer with MyBnk says financial education is as much about young people understanding the public finances as their own personal finances.</p> <p>\"I hope that they are empowered with the knowledge to make their own decisions and to have more say in how the economy works,\" she says.</p> <p>One thing that stands out wherever she runs sessions, says Colvin, is an entrenched view about how the government spends its money. \"They are saying things like (money goes) to benefit scroungers. When you ask them what the government spends its money on you'd think that the first thing they would say is schools or hospitals but they say people who are not working. Those media messages filter down.\"</p> <p>Freddie Ewer co-founder of the financial education group <a href=\"http://redstart.redington.co.uk/home\" title=\"\">RedStart</a> says new teaching in the area must work towards changing attitudes in the UK.</p> <p>\"This has a huge role to play in ensuring we don't end up with another huge debt driven financial crisis,\" he says.</p> <p>RedStart, spun out of a pensions adviser, is also seeing rising demand from schools for its sessions. It is recruiting companies in the financial sector to host and teach the workshops.</p> <p>\"I think the financial crisis has brought a shift in financial responsibility away from government and big business to individuals, for example, in pensions, tuition fees, increasing use of private healthcare. If you are going to put all this responsibility on the shoulders of people you need to have an education system that explains to them at a young age how basic financial concepts work,\" says Ewer.</p> <p>There are worries that the national curriculum changes will leave many children behind. MyBnk points out there are still no compulsory financial lessons for anyone over 16, when they may be facing big financial decisions. Also, academies and free schools can opt out of teaching the national curriculum.</p> <p>Teachers themselves will need training or outside help, say charities.</p> <p>\"A lot of these people who are being asked to teach financial education have never been taught it themselves,\" says RedStart's Ewer.</p> <p>The deputy head at Heartlands, Alice Clay, is hopeful that given her school has included financial education in classes for some time, the new term will not bring a significant shift. But she expects some areas of the new curriculum to be more challenging than others.</p> <p>\"The children are really interested in the enterprise part of things and business planning. We have to work harder to keep them interested in personal finance issues,\" she says.</p> <h2>Adult habits</h2> <p>Campaigners for financial education say the government must not stop at September's changes to the national curriculum. </p> <p>Cambridge University research suggests adult money habits are set in by the time children are seven.

      "bodyText": "Cath Kidston, the high street queen of florals, has banked a second fortune from her eponymous homewares empire. The London-based designer and her business partners TA Associates are in line for multimillion-pound payouts after selling a \"substantial\" number of shares to an Asian private equity house. It is the second time the entrepreneur, famous for her chintzy fabrics and retro kitchenware, has sold down her stake in the company. The deal is thought to have valued the British retailer at close to \u00a3250m, making Kidston's personal holding worth around \u00a350m. It is not clear how big a chunk she has sold but TA Associates and Hong Kong based Baring Private Equity Asia now own equal stakes in the business with the management team sitting on a reduced minority holding. Kidston's teapots and oilcloths, which embrace the image of the 1950s housewife, celebrating baking, afternoon tea and knitting, were a surprise high street hit that has now been successfully exported as far afield as Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and Malaysia. The rationale behind the deal is to capitalise on soaring demand in Asia with the company pointing to research that indicates Chinese workers migrating to its cities have the same hankering for the country life that has fuelled the retro brand's popularity here. Kidston is aware that her polka dot plates and cabbage rose tea towels evoke a \"marmite reaction\", telling one interviewer: \"People either love it and want a little bit of it very much, or want to stab us.\" But the first camp are clearly in the ascendence with the success of the business reflected in the hefty price tag. Kidston also made millions of pounds back in 2010 when TA Associates bought a controlling stake in a deal which then valued the company at around \u00a3100m. The sale is another stepping stone in Cath Kidston's journey from a single store in London's upmarket Holland Park, selling vintage wallpaper and brightly painted furniture, to Cath Kidston Inc with 166 stores around the world and a turnover of \u00a3144m. In a rare interview with Red magazine last year, Kidston \u2013 who is the cousin of rival style guru Kirstie Allsopp \u2013 said the aesthetic was inspired by happy memories of her childhood in Hampshire. When she opened her first shop in 1993: \"No one was selling these things. There was no such thing as a flowery ironing board. I found a shop with cheap rent and no deposit \u2013 you could do that in those days.\" Billed as a modern day Laura Ashley, Kidston's heavy floral prints have become as ubiquitous in the UK over the last decade as Ashley's romantic prints were in the 70s. The domestic chain has 66 stores with the brand in danger of reaching saturation after giving everything from Millets' tents to Sky boxes and Tesco carrier bags the floral treatment. It has no plans for additional UK stores but the great white hope is mainland China where it has ambitions to open 100 oulets. Kenny Wilson, Cath Kidston's chief executive, said: \"Finding the right partner to help us manage the development of the Cath Kidston brand in Asia, and in particular to exploit its potential in China, was a key consideration for us. Baring Asia's support and operational experience will be invaluable as we expand.\" Baring Asia specialises in bringing western brands to China, having previously bought companies such as private school group Nord Anglia Education and a stake in the Indian arm of French concrete manufacturer Lafarge. \"The Cath Kidston brand has demonstrated its significant appeal and established a strong following in Asia,\" said Dar Chen, a managing director at Baring Asia.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Amazon's move to scrap free delivery on orders below \u00a310 has hit profits at Royal Mail, sending its shares down to their lowest level since the postal service's controversial flotation last October. In a trading update ahead of its first annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, the 500-year-old institution warned that the performance of its crucial parcels business had been weaker than expected. The shares, floated at 330p, were the second biggest faller in the FTSE 100, losing 16p to finish at 450p. In January they were changing hands at 615p. Chief executive Moya Greene said the business was facing increasingly tough competition, with parcels revenue \u2013 supposed to be the driver of growth in the business \u2013 down 1% over the three months to the end of June. Overall revenues were up 2% over the three months to the end of June as a result of a rise in election mailouts in the run-up to the May elections and the March increase in stamp prices, which saw the cost of a first class letter rise 2p to 62p. However, letter post is in long-term decline. Richard Hunter, head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said the honeymoon period for Royal Mail was over. \"The weakness in the parcels performance is a concern, and may prompt questions as to whether this is transient, or whether the change is structural,\" he said. \"The fact that this decline has been offset by an improvement in the letters business, which is not a long-term area of growth, and cost-cutting measures, may help in the shorter term, but these are both temporary reliefs.\" Royal Mail blamed the slip in its parcels business on Amazon's decision to introduce a \u00a310 minimum spend for free delivery. Amazon has also expanded its own delivery network. The online retail giant scrapped free \"super-saver\" delivery on items worth less than \u00a310 in January, introducing a minimum spend, which resulted in fewer parcels being delivered through Royal Mail. The post service also faces stiff competition in its main UK parcels market from rivals including UPS, TNT and Yodel. In the UK letters remain the biggest earner for Royal Mail, bringing in 59% of its income compared with 41% from parcels. However, letters are expected to decline by around 4% to 6% each year, while parcel delivery is usually seen as a growth business as consumers embrace online shopping. In its letters arm Royal Mail has warned that a rival TNT Post UK delivery service, that targets only the most profitable areas of Britain, could hit its revenue by over \u00a3200m by 2017/18, threatening the future of its own six-day-a-week universal service. The group attempted to mitigate the impact of the TNT rollout by proposing a price rise for rivals using the Royal Mail network, but abandoned the move when TNT complained to Ofcom, prompting an investigation by the regulator. Royal Mail is not changing its forecast for full-year profits, although last week it warned it could face a hefty fine from French authorities, who are investigating alleged anti-competitive practices at Royal Mail's French parcel delivery business. TNT Express and FedEx are also being investigated and face possible fines. The group's European parcel delivery business, GLS, which operates in 37 countries, turned in a robust performance, with revenues up 6%. Greene said that trading had been characterised by a good performance in the letters business, but \"a weaker than expected performance in UK parcels, largely driven by the intensifying competitive environment\". Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Robin Byde, who has a \"sell\" rating on Royal Mail shares, said Royal Mail could be in for a bumpy ride as rivals sharpen their prices: \"The key challenge remains weakness in parcel pricing in the UK. In our view, the company faces a considerable volume and pricing challenge in parcels in the next 18 months.\" Greene will face shareholders in Birmingham on Thursday, where she is expected to face questions over her \u00a31.35m salary and pay package, as well as threats to Royal Mail's universal service obligation \u2013 the pledge to deliver letters at the same price to all parts of the country six days a week. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 July",

      "bodyText": "As tensions in Ukraine eased and hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza emerged, stock markets managed to recover from recent losses, writes Nick Fletcher. The FTSE 100 reached a two week high, helped by positive results from chip designer Arm, while Germany\u2019s Dax jumped sharply as the prospects of further sanctions on Russia seemed to fade. The final scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 66.9 points or 0.99% higher at 6795.34 \u2022 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.27% to 9734.33 \u2022 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.5% higher at 4369.52 \u2022 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 2.16% to 20,873.5 \u2022 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.59% better at 10,648.9 Over in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 70 points or 0.4% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Time to recap. The UK government's deficit reduction plans have been questioned after Britain borrowed \u00a311.4bn to balance the books last month, more than expected. Several economists have predicted that the official debt target for this year is \"increasingly challenging\", just three months into the financial year. John Bulford, economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club warns: The lack of any meaningful improvement relative to June last year is a concern. The positive effects of the Swiss Capital Tax and high earners deferring income from the previous tax year to take advantage of the reduction in the top rate of income tax are beginning to fade. \u201cWith central government spending seemingly well under control, most of the disappointment is coming from revenues. The slowdown in growth in VAT receipts is perhaps the biggest let-down, particularly given the apparent strength of the consumer. VAT receipts were up just 4.3% to the same three months a year ago, the worst performance for almost a year.\u201d On an underlying basis, borrowing was little changed compared to a year ago, despite the recovery. The figures provoked a political clash. Treasury insisted that the government's plans were on track (if unfinished), but Labour responded that Britain is off-course. \u2022 The latest US inflation data has shown that core prices rose by less than expected in June. Gasoline prices, though, kept the headline cost-of-living rate up at 2.1%. That pushed European stock markets higher this afternoon. \u2022 The CBI reported that British factories remain optimistic about future prospects, with investment plans at a record high. Demand has come off the boil a little this month, though, and manufacturers are worried about geopolitical risks. \u2022 Royal Bank of Scotland has been accused of being 'wilful obtuse' when testifying to MPs last month. \u2022 Royal Mail shares are on track for their lowest closing price since floating last October. They're down 4% this afternoon at 447p, after warning that parcel revenues are below expectations. \u2022 And Switzerland's Credit Suisse bank has said it \"deeply regrets\" its involvement in US tax evasion, after posting its biggest loss since 2008. It could be the best stock market statement ever, suggests the Telegraph's Graham Ruddick. And he's got a point. Property investment firm Panther Securities, run by Tory-turned-UKIP supporter Andrew Perloff, has thrown an almighty strop after seeing its representative kicked off the board of department store Beale. As Panther is the biggest shareholder in Beale, and its 'related parties' have loaned it a million pounds, the move has gone down rather badly. Perloff has used the official stock market news feed to hit back, saying: \"I have long held the view that: 1) It is foolish to upset your Landlord. 2) It is foolish to upset those that provide you with finance. 3) It is foolish for a quoted company to upset its largest shareholder. 4) It is foolish to sack a Director who is knowledgeable, well connected and who does not charge a salary or any expenses. In one fell swoop Beales has managed all of these, which must be some type of record! It is hard to understand their logic.\" Perloff does have 'previous form' for unusual stock market statements - through his \"Chairman's ramblings\". Enjoy..... The US housing market may be pulling out of its slump -- home resales jumped by 2.6% in June, the fastest rate in eight months. European stock markets have rallied higher on the back of the US inflation report. Traders are calculating that the dip in core inflation means the 'punchbowl' of loose monetary policy isn't running dry, even though the headline rate remained at 2.1%. The FTSE 100 is up 60 points, or 0.9%, with chipmaker ARM still leading the way after decent results and forecasts this morning. The other main bourses are also up at least 1%. The US stock market has also opened slightly higher, with the Dow Jones up 0.2% in early trading. Here's AP's take on the US inflation data: U.S. consumer prices rose in June at a slightly slower pace than in May with two-thirds of the June advance driven by the largest jump in gasoline prices in a year. The Labor Department says prices rose 0.3 percent in June following a 0.4 percent rise in May which had been the biggest one-month gain in more than a year. Energy prices were up 1.6 percent, nearly double the May gain, reflecting a sharp 3.3 percent rise in gasoline costs. But food costs edged up just 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since January. Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy, were up just 0.1 percent. Over the past 12 months, core prices are up 1.9 percent, an indication of moderate inflation. Economists reckon that the drop in US core inflation, to 1.9% in June, means the Federal Reserve won't fret about inflationary pressure building. And that means less pressure to raise interest rates from their current record low. Here's some instant reaction: The US inflation rate was 2.1% in June, in line with expectations and matching May's figure, according to data just released. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.3% compared with May. Higher gasoline prices were a key factor. But core inflation was lower than forecast. Stripping out energy and food prices, 'core inflation' rose by just 0.1% month-on-month, or 1.9% compared with a year ago. At first glance, there's little here to prompt the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates sooner than previously thought. Reaction to follow.... Nearly time for the final event of the day... US inflation. Economists predict that the cost of living rose by 2.1% year-on-year in June. McDonald's continues to struggle to stem its falling sales in the US and Europe. In its latest results, just released, the fast food giant reported that comparable sales across America fell by 1.5% in the April-June quarter. It blamed: ...negative comparable guest traffic amid ongoing broad-based challenges. And in Europe, like-for-like sales fell 1.0% in the quarter, partly due to \"ongoing weakness\" in Germany. And there's no immediate sign of improvement. McDonald's CEO, Don Thompson, warned that: As such, full year 2014 global comparable sales are expected to be relatively similar to year-to-date June performance, with July global comparable sales expected to be negative. McDonald's also missed profit forecasts, with earnings of $1.40 per share. And its shares have dropped 1.4% in pre-market trading, Royal Bank of Scotland has been accused of being \"wilfully obtuse\" in front of a committee of MPs, over claims that it deliberately drove small firms to the wall. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Committee, has laid into RBS over evidence given by senior managers to his committee last month. The allegations centre on the bank's \"Global Restructuring Group\" (GRG). Last month Derek Sach, head of GRG, insisted that the division was not a \"profit centre\". Now, though, RBS has admitted that Sir Andrew Large, who investigated GRG, was right, and it is a \"profit centre\" after all (although it still denies deliberately destroying firms to generate profits) Tyrie is seriously unimpressed by RBS's conduct. He says: \u201cRBS had not objected to the term \u2018profit centre\u2019 when given extensive opportunity to comment on drafts of Sir Andrew\u2019s report last year. Yet it decided to contest the term in evidence to the Committee, not only in a written statement in February, but also repeatedly in its public hearing in June. Following the Committee\u2019s decision to write to Sir Andrew Large for clarification, RBS has now offered the Committee what it euphemistically describes as \u2018additional comments\u2019. In fact, they have done a belated U-turn. It\u2019s not as if the facts have changed. So it now appears that RBS has been wilfully obtuse with the Committee. This isn't the end of the matter. Tyrie is taking the matter up with RBS chairman, Sir Philip Hampton. \u201cIf this is how RBS deals with a parliamentary Committee, how much can customers and regulators rely on it to be straightforward with them? \u201cI will be writing to the Chairman of RBS about this, and the Committee will report on it after the summer.\u201d Here's my colleague Jill Treanor's story about last month's hearing: RBS executives deny wrecking small businesses to make a profit Ian Hannam, the City 'rainmaker' who was once one of Britain's most powerful bankers, has, finally, been fined \u00a3450,000 for breaching the UK's market abuse rules. The FCA confirmed the penalty this morning, after Hannam lost his final appeal. The case centred on emails which Hannam, then at JP Morgan, had sent to clients in 2008 disclosing information not yet in the public domain. He has repeatedly argued that the messages did not breach market abuse rules, but has now been forced to pay up. Tracey McDermott, the FCA\u2019s director of Enforcement and Financial crime, says City workers should learn from Hannam's example: \u201cThis has been a long and complex case but the Tribunal\u2019s substantial judgment is a landmark. It should leave market participants in no doubt that casual and uncontrolled distribution of inside information is not acceptable in today\u2019s markets. Controlling the flow of inside information is a key way of preventing market abuse and we would urge all market participants to pay close attention to the judgment.\u201d Britain's Canary Wharf is heading eastwards, with plans for an extra 3,000 homes and new towers in the Docklands area. It should create thousands more jobs too, as my colleague Julia Kollewe explains: More than 3,000 homes are to be built at the eastern edge of Canary Wharf after Tower Hamlets council gave the green light for the project, the first extension to the financial district since the banking crisis struck in 2008. Canary Wharf Group, which is majority-owned by Songbird, has been granted planning permission to build 30 new buildings, comprising 4.9m sq ft of homes, offices and shops, at Wood Wharf, east of the development. This includes a cylindrical residential skyscraper designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, the Swiss architects behind Tate Modern and the \"Bird's Nest\" Olympic stadium in Beijing. Canary Wharf spreads east with new towers and 3,000 homes planned Britain's factory owners remain optimistic about prospects this summer, although export order growth has tailed off. The CBI's industrial trends survey, released this morning, also found that manufacturers are prepared to invest in new equipment and premises, despite growing worries about geopolitical risks. The CBI said: The balance for new domestic orders (+23%) was the highest since July 1988 (+25%), but export orders (0%) were flat, following growth in the three months to April (+16%) Firms are upbeat about the next quarter, with expectations for total new orders growth at their strongest since 1977, and export orders set to rebound. Looking to the year ahead, there are also encouraging signs: manufacturers\u2019 plans for investment in product and process innovation are at their strongest since 1989, with robust plans for spending on plant &amp; machinery, and buildings. The number of firms investing to expand capacity reached a record high (since 1979). However... the proportion of firms concerned that political and economic conditions abroad may limit export orders rose sharply to a five-quarter high. More details here. The opposition Labour party has seized on today's public finance figures as proof that the government is off course (something the Treasury has tried to 'pre-but' already): Chris Leslie, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury says: \u201cGeorge Osborne is not only set to break his promise to balance the books by next year, he is also borrowing more so far this year than the same period last year. \u201cBorrowing is now expected to be almost \u00a3190 billion more than planned under this Government. This is the cost of three damaging years of flat lining and falling living standards we have seen since the election. And with an election due in 10 months, Leslie explains how Labour would (aim to) do better: \u201cAs Labour\u2019s National Policy Forum agreed this weekend, Labour will balance the books and get the national debt falling as soon as possible in the next Parliament. But we will get the deficit down more fairly by reforming our economy for the long-term and reversing David Cameron's top rate tax cut for the top one per cent of earners.\" The Centre for Economics and Business Research reckons whoever wins the next UK general election will have to make \"sharp public spending cuts\". Here's senior economist Rob Harbron on today's public finance figures: The surprisingly high June result from the public finances leaves the UK\u2019s debt to GDP ratio at 77.3%. This is a new high despite solid GDP growth in 2014, highlighting the size of the debt mountain that will need to be tackled over the next parliament. Harbron also believes the official forecasts are too optimistic: Overall, although the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts a return to budgetary surplus in 2018/19, Cebr expects a deficit of \u00a322 billion to remain at that point. This is due to the buoyant growth projected by the OBR over the medium term \u2013 a time during which Cebr expects economic expansion to be curtailed by sharp but necessary fiscal retraction. Three months into the financial year, Britain's underlying public sector net borrowing is \u00a32.4bn higher than in 2013/2014 (despite falling slightly from \u00a311.5bn to \u00a311.4bn in June). The British Chambers of Commerce's chief economist, David Kern, says that's a worrying sign: The way things are right now, the deficit reduction predicted by the Office of Budget Responsibility appears to be very difficult to achieve. Kern fears that the UK's tax-generating powers may have been permanently hit by the crisis: \u201cSince the financial crisis, weaknesses in the financial sector and structural changes in the rest of the economy have created a major shortfall in the UK\u2019s ability to generate tax revenues, even as economic growth returns to normal. The government must adjust to these new realities and continue to reduce the share of current public spending in GDP. This will be difficult, and perhaps unpopular, but it is essential if we are to secure a lasting recovery.\u201d Samuel Tombs, senior UK Economist at Capital Economics, says today's public finances data show the government is struggling to get the deficit down. Tombs explains: The Office for Budget Responsibility's underlying measure of borrowing \u2013 Public sector net borrowing excluding APF and Royal Mail pension fund transfers \u2013 was \u00a311.4bn in June, only a fraction lower than June 2013\u2019s \u00a311.5bn. Given April and May\u2019s hefty deficits, this left borrowing in the first three months of the fiscal year 7% higher this year than last. Since the OBR expects the deficit to be about 10% lower this year as a whole, the fiscal consolidation still seems to be off track. But there's good news for George Osborne too -- Tombs reckons the public finances should improve later this year: The annual comparison looks bad partly because tax receipts were boosted in May and June 2013 by the cut in the additional income tax rate. Indeed, corporation tax and VAT receipts have grown more strongly than the OBR expected. What\u2019s more, stronger economic growth than the OBR predicted back in March should help to boost tax receipts and reduce benefits spending faster than set out in the fiscal plans. However.... June\u2019s borrowing numbers underline that the fiscal consolidation still has a long way to go yet before the public finances are restored to a sustainable footing. The Treasury insists that the UK public finances are on course, despite having to borrow \u00a311.4bn in June. Here's the official comment: The government\u2019s long term economic plan is working, delivering economic security for hardworking people. Today\u2019s Public Sector Net Borrowing figures continue to be in line with the budget forecast which predicts the deficit to have halved by the end of this year. But the job is not yet done which is why we must continue to work through the plan that is building a resilient economy.\u201d And this chart shows how the UK public finances are, by one measure, rather worse than a year ago. That's because the Bank of England transferred some profits made by buying UK government debt (through its quantitative easing scheme) in June 2013, making the finances look better. This chart underlines how the UK has failed to cut public borrowing so far this year (blue) compared to the 2013-14 financial year (red). Stamp duty revenuue, though, is up more than 43% year on year. Today's public finance figures show the UK government is struggling to bring down the deficit. Here's Reuters' early take: Britain's public finances showed a bigger than expected deficit in June, continuing a weak start to the tax year that leaves finance minister George Osborne with a lot of catching up to do to meet his fiscal goals. The latest figures show the government has so far failed to reduce public borrowing during the first three months of the 2014/15 fiscal year, with less than a year to go before a national election. The public sector finances, excluding financial sector interventions, showed a deficit of \u00a311.368bn in June, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.This is up from \u00a37.594bn in June 2013 and well above analyst forecasts of a deficit of \u00a310.65bn. Stripping out the effect of cash transfers from the Bank of England, the 2014/15 deficit to date was \u00a336.1bn, 7.3% higher than at the same point a year ago. Britain's government is aiming to get the deficit down to 5.5% of gross domestic product in the 2014/15 fiscal year, from 6.5% of GDP in 2013/14.The ONS said that some factors meant that trends in borrowing in the first three months of this tax year might not be representative of the year as a whole. The first three months of 2013 saw higher than usual income tax payments, due to tax changes, and there were also receipts from a Swiss tax avoidance deal. Income tax in the first three months of this tax year was 3.5 percent lower than in the first three months of the 2013/14 tax year. Payments of grants to local authorities also followed a different pattern, an ONS official said. Just in: Britain borrowed \u00a311.386bn to balance the nation's books in June - more than expected, and more than a year ago. Analysts had predicted a deficit of \u00a310.665bn. In June 2013, the UK borrowed \u00a37.594bn (although this was flattered by one-off factors). That's not a great sign for the state of the UK's finances, showing little progress in bringing the deficit down. Details and reaction to follow... European stock markets are all trading higher today, as investors decide they're less worried about geopolitical tensions (for the moment). The news that Ukrainian separatists have handed over the black boxes from flight MH 17 has been taken as a positive sign \u2013 despite the intense international outcry over Russia's conduct. FTSE 100: up 40 points at 6768, + 0.6% German DAX: up 44 points at 9654, + 0.44% French CAC: up 12 points at 4317, + 0.3% Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, explains: There has been rising speculation of a ceasefire in Gaza being agreed today as US Secretary of State Kerry arrives in the region, while after far too long a wait the black boxes from downed flight MH17 have been handed over to the Ukrainian government/Malaysian experts. UK chipmaker ARM is leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 3.2%, after predicting that revenue growth will accelerate later this year. Saudi Arabia is poised to open its stock market to foreign investment, and analysts believe there could be a rush to join the Arab world\u2019s biggest bourse. Saudi's Capital Market Authority said today it is planning to open the market to direct investment by foreign financial institutions in the first half of 2015. Draft regulations will be released in August. That could lure money from other emerging markets, such as Russia. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, says today's warning (and share price drop) shows that Royal Mail's \"honeymoon period\" is over. The weakness in the parcels performance is a concern, and may prompt questions as to whether this is transient, or whether the change is structural. The fact that this decline has been offset by an improvement in the letters business, which is not a long term area of growth, and cost cutting measures, may help in the shorter term, but these are both temporary reliefs. Royal Mail shares have dropped 2.5% this morning after it warned that revenues from its parcels business isn't meeting expectations. The recently privatised postal operator blamed changes at Amazon for eating into this crucial area of revenue, along with increased competition. Royal Mail warned: Changes to Amazon's minimum order level for free delivery and expansion of its own delivery network have reduced addressable market volumes. Competition in account and consumer/small business parcels has intensified more than expected as other carriers seek to fill capacity in their networks by aggressively reducing prices It's not a full-blown profit warning, though, as letters revenue has held up better than expected. But Moya Greene, Royal Mail CEO, warned that Christmas trading will be crucial. \"Our parcels revenue will be dependent on our performance in the second half, which includes the Christmas trading period, and on no further weakening in our addressable UK parcels market.\" Royal Mail shares slid by 11p to 455p - which, co-incidentally, is the level they closed at when the company was floated on October 11. That's still 37% above the 330p float price. But back in January they were changing hands for over \u00a36. Credit Suisse's results haven't wowed the stock market -- shares are down 0.69% in early trading. Despite that inflow of new money, Credit Suisse's Private Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM) division didn't hit forecasts, due to weaker profit margins. That took the shine off its investment banking arm, which beat forecast by 22%. Esp\u00edrito Santo Investment Bank analysts warned: \"While the investment bank has outperformed this quarter, PBWM continues to disappoint. Credit Suisse's clients haven't deserted it, though, despite the humiliation of pleading guilty to an \u201cextensive and wide-ranging conspiracy\u201d to help US clients evade taxes. Its private banking business attracted 10.1 billion francs of new money in the quarter. Credit Suisse's eye-watering $2.6m penalty for aiding tax evasion has encouraged Swiss banks to change their ways, argues Bernhard Bauhofer of investment bank Sparring Partners. Bauhofer told Bloomberg TV that the case is: \"still negatively impacting Credit Suisse, and hurting its reputation worldwide\". We're now seeing a completely different picture in Switzerland now, he claimed, with banks changing their models, and growing strongly in Asia. Shareholders in Credit Suisse are counting the cost of the bank's involvement with US tax evasion this morning, after it reported its biggest loss since the financial crisis erupted in 2008. Credit Suisse posted a loss of 700 million Swiss francs, or \u00a3457m, for the last quarter this morning, a sharp reversal on the 1.05bn Swiss francs earned a year ago. That's a bigger loss than expected. It was dragged deep into the red by the $2.6bn charge agreed with American authorities for helping US citizens to avoid tax in May. Chief executive Brady Dougan insists that Credit Suisse deeply regretted its past activities, having been forced to plead guilty to the crime of aiding US tax evasion. Dougan said: \"I want to reiterate that we deeply regret the past misconduct that led to this settlement and that we take full responsibility for it. \"The continued trust and support of our clients helped us mitigate the impact of the settlement on our business.\" The Credit Suisse fine, and guilty plea, looks like a landmark moment in the battle between tax authorities and banks who profited from offering their clients' secrecy. And in another a sign of the changes in banking, Credit Suisse says it will now wind down its commodities trading arm, to focus on more profitable areas. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. It's a busy day for economic news, both in Britain and the US. In the UK, the latest public finance figures are released at 9.30am - showing how much the government had to borrow to balance the books in June. Economists expect a slight improvement, with public sector net borrowing dropping to just(?) \u00a39.4bn, from \u00a311.5bn in May. At 11am, the CBI's latest industrial trends survey will show how UK factories fared last month. Then at 1.30pm, the biggie -- the US inflation rate for June. Traders will be eying this release for signs of inflationary pressure building in the American economy; a factor in when the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. Stan Shamu of IG explains: The market is looking for a 0.2% month-on-month rise which implies an annual run rate of 2%. We also have existing home sales and the Richmond manufacturing index on the calendar. We'll also be keeping an eye on Greece, where ministers were yesterday urged to hurry up and implement various measures before its troika of lenders return to Athens: In the corporate world, results from Royal Mail and Credit Suisse will get attention this morning -- with Apple, Microsoft and McDonalds reporting tonight. And European stock markets are expected to rise modestly, after a decent day's trading in Asia: I'll be tracking the main events through the day as usual....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 3,000 homes are to be built at the eastern edge of Canary Wharf after Tower Hamlets council approved the project, the first extension to the financial district since the 2008 banking crisis. Canary Wharf Group, majority-owned by Songbird Estates, has been granted planning permission to construct 30 buildings, comprising 4.9m square feet of homes, offices and shops, at Wood Wharf, just a stone's throw from the headquarters of some of the world's largest banks. Homes at Wood Wharf will range from parkside townhouses to towers, with a mix of private and social housing. Its centrepiece is also the tallest building, a 211-metre 57-storey cylindrical residential skyscraper facing the waters of South Dock, designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, the Swiss architects behind Tate Modern (including its extension which is being built at the moment) and the \"Bird's Nest\" Olympic stadium in Beijing. About a quarter of the \"habitable rooms\" of the 3,100 homes will be earmarked for affordable housing, built around 3.6 hectares (9 acres) of parks and public squares, including hundreds of metres of dockside paths. A Tower Hamlets council spokesman said the project \"will make a strategic contribution to both the council's housing and employment needs\". He added: \"The development will be well-supported by a proposed new primary school, health facility and an idea store [library], along with 25% on-site affordable housing... This development will contribute to the continued growth of the north Docklands area as one of the most exciting and vibrant places to live and work in London.\" Lutfur Rahman, the mayor of Tower Hamlets, said: \"It will generate thousands of jobs for local residents, it will create high quality affordable homes, and the development itself will be an iconic addition to Tower Hamlets.\" Developers have been rushing to build more luxury homes in London to exploit booming property prices, with Canary Wharf Group just starting construction of its first residential building on the western edge of the finance district, the 58-storey Newfoundland tower (nicknamed the Diamond tower) with 566 apartments, which is due to be completed in 2018. More than 100,000 workers commute daily to Canary Wharf, which opened in the early 1990s. Sir George Iacobescu, chief executive of Canary Wharf Group, believes the eastern extension will almost double the number of people working and living in the area within the next ten years. Work on the Wood Wharf site is expected to start this autumn with the first buildings occupied at the end of 2018, to coincide with the arrival of Crossrail, the \u00a315bn railway running east-west across London. The new area will include offices targeted at technology start-ups and creative media, as well as a 420-place primary school, an NHS medical centre, a hotel and more than 100 shops, restaurants and cafes. The project, the biggest in the developer's pipeline, is expected to create more than 17,000 jobs during its construction, ranging from architects and planners to electricians, with 3,500 earmarked for local residents. Canary Wharf Group paid \u00a390m to take full control of the Wood Wharf site two years ago from its joint venture partners Waterways and Ballymore. Canary Wharf is home to the global headquarters of Barclays and HSBC, and the London headquarters of investment banks JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Citigroup. However, the Financial Conduct Authority is moving further east, to Stratford, by 2018. In its first foray outside the Docklands, Canary Wharf Group \u2013 whose parent Songbird is part-owned by Qatar Holding, the investment arm of the Gulf state \u2013 is also revamping London's South Bank, around the Shell Centre tower, in partnership with Qatari Diar, the Gulf state's property investment company.",

This development will contribute to the continued growth of the north Docklands area as one of the most exciting and vibrant places to live and work in London.\"</p> <p>Lutfur Rahman, the mayor of Tower Hamlets, said: \"It will generate thousands of jobs for local residents, it will create high quality affordable homes, and the development itself will be an iconic addition to Tower Hamlets.\"</p> <p>Developers have been rushing to build more luxury homes in London to exploit booming property prices, with Canary Wharf Group just starting construction of its first residential building on the western edge of the finance district, the 58-storey Newfoundland tower (nicknamed the Diamond tower) with 566 apartments, which is due to be completed in 2018.</p> <p>More than 100,000 workers commute daily to Canary Wharf, which opened in the early 1990s. Sir George Iacobescu, chief executive of Canary Wharf Group, believes the eastern extension will almost double the number of people working and living in the area within the next ten years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-442732087\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/22/1406036607624/Wood-Wharf--003.jpg\" alt=\"Wood Wharf \" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The planned Herzog & de Meuron tower.

The new area will include offices targeted at technology start-ups and creative media, as well as a 420-place primary school, an NHS medical centre, a hotel and more than 100 shops, restaurants and cafes.</p> <p>The project, the biggest in the developer's pipeline, is expected to create more than 17,000 jobs during its construction, ranging from architects and planners to electricians, with 3,500 earmarked for local residents. Canary Wharf Group paid \u00a390m to take full control of the Wood Wharf site two years ago from its joint venture partners Waterways and Ballymore.</p> <p>Canary Wharf is home to the global headquarters of Barclays and HSBC, and the London headquarters of investment banks JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Citigroup. However, the Financial Conduct Authority is moving further east, to Stratford, by 2018.</p> <p>In its first foray outside the Docklands, Canary Wharf Group \u2013 whose parent Songbird is part-owned by Qatar Holding, the investment arm of the Gulf state \u2013 is also revamping London's South Bank, around the Shell Centre tower, in partnership with Qatari Diar, the Gulf state's property investment company.</p>",

Stripping out the impact of a one-off cash transfer from the Bank of England in June last year, borrowing in the first three months of the 2014-15 fiscal year was \u00a336.1bn, 7.3% higher than the same period last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. At the time of the March budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility \u2013 the Treasury's independent forecaster \u2013 predicted a fall in government borrowing this year to \u00a395.5bn, from \u00a3105.8bn in 2013-14.

The annual comparison looks bad partly because of higher-than-usual income tax payments early last year, which were the result of tax changes. The figures last year were also boosted by receipts from a Swiss tax avoidance deal. The Treasury said: \"Today's public sector net borrowing figures continue to be in line with the budget forecast, which predicts the deficit to have halved by the end of this year. But the job is not yet done which is why we must continue to work through the plan that is building a resilient economy.\" The UK's national debt was \u00a31.3tn at the end of June, equivalent to 77.3% of GDP. Chris Leslie MP, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Borrowing is now expected to be almost \u00a3190bn more than planned under this government.

However, either course of action could be negative for the stock at least in the near term. A dividend cut would take away any yield support.

Panmure Gordon analyst Jonathan Helliwell cut his recommendation from buy to sell, on the basis that any revamp of the business could hurt it in the short term, as the same time as it suffers adverse currency pressures. Helliwell said new chief executive Tim Cobbold, who started in May, should cut the company's dividend and sell PRNewswire to leave the company as a high growth, pure global events business. He said: However, this could hurt the stock in the near term. We also argue that consensus estimates look around 11% too high reflecting foreign exchange pressures and near term constraints in events. We move our price target from 940p to 590p and our rating from buy to sell. He added: We believe that over time UBM could reinvest proceeds from a sale of PRNewswire (\u00a3480m estimated) at a return on investment equal to or better than the return achieved on a PRN sale (6.2% post tax estimated). Meantime a dividend cut would repair cover and generate a free cash flow of up to \u00a3100m per annum to invest in the global events sector, where M&amp;A opportunities remain significant. However, either course of action could be negative for the stock at least in the near term. A dividend cut would take away any yield support. A sale of PRN could be significantly earnings per share-dilutive in the near term (up to 33% on our estimates, depending on tax) and introduces significant execution risk both on the sale and reinvestment. UBM's shares are currently 6.5p lower at 648p.",
