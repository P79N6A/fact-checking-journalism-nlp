Despite the size of the fine, HSBC's shares on the London stock exchange rose by 2.8p to 644p. Last month HSBC announced third-quarter pre-tax profits to $3.5bn (\u00a32.2bn). Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said the fine was slightly lower than the $2bn he had been pencilling in to his forecasts. But he said: \"HSBC's settlement with the US authorities will include a deferred prosecution agreement with the department of justice of five years' duration. Given HSBC's ongoing US business and other continuing conduct investigations, this sword of Damocles is not without teeth, albeit based on what we know, we are regarding the $1.921bn settlement as de facto 'final'.\"",

Delta will pay $360m (\u00a3224m) to Singapore Airlines, ending the Asian group's disappointing 12-year investment in Virgin. Singapore Airlines had acquired the near-half share from Branson in 2000 for \u00a3600m. Virgin's new partnership arrangements with Delta, which will require clearance from competition authorities, have been presented as a direct response to the controversial alliance between American Airlines and BA which handed the two airlines 60% of the transatlantic market two years ago. Branson has insisted the much-anticipated deal with Delta does not sound a death knell for the Virgin Atlantic brand \u2013 despite speculation to the contrary from Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA parent IAG, in recent days. Publicity around the tie-up between Delta and Virgin came close to descending into farce as Branson and Walsh taunted each other over the likely consequences for the airline established by the Virgin entrepreneur 28 years ago. Walsh disparagingly suggested that Delta would not tolerate Branson's brand for long, suggesting the US airline was really largely focused on securing Virgin's Heathrow airport slots. Branson hit back, provocatively proposing a \u00a31m bet that the Virgin brand would remain in existence for at least five years.

Customers at New York's John F Kennedy airport will be able to use either the Delta or the Virgin lounge which are alongside one another, while Delta's operations at Heathrow are expected to move alongside those of Virgin's at terminal three in years to come. The collaborative operation will bring together Virgin's six round-trip flights a day from Heathrow to JFK with a further three operated by Delta. While both sides acknowledged deal negotiations had been hard fought, Delta's chief executive, Richard Anderson, sought to smooth over suggestions of any remaining tensions or cultural clashes with Branson's airline. \"To be associated with a great business leader and a great business brand like this is truly humbling for us at Delta,\" he insisted, adding that Delta and Virgin cultures would \"mesh well together\".

      "bodyText": "HSBC was guilty of a \"blatant failure\" to implement anti-money laundering controls and wilfully flouted US sanctions, American prosecutors said, as the bank was forced to pay a record $1.9bn (\u00a31.2bn) to settle allegations it allowed terrorists to move money around the financial system. Hours after the bank's chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said he was \"profoundly sorry\" for the failures, assistant attorney general Lanny Breuer told a press conference in New York that Mexican drug traffickers deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars each day in HSBC accounts. At least $881m in drug trafficking money was laundered throughout the bank's accounts. \"HSBC is being held accountable for stunning failures of oversight \u2013 and worse,\" said Breuer, \"that led the bank to permit narcotics traffickers and others to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through HSBC subsidiaries and to facilitate hundreds of millions more in transactions with sanctioned countries.\" In Mexico the bank \"severely understaffed\" its compliance department and failed to implement an anti-money laundering programme despite evidence of serious risks. A complex scheme known as the black market peso exchange (BMPE) was used to launder the cash. Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance said: \"New York is the centre of international finance and those who use our banks as a vehicle for international crime will not be tolerated.\" In the latest embarrassment for Britain's banks, Gulliver said: \"We accept responsibility for our past mistakes.

The fine for HSBC comes barely 24 hours after Standard Chartered paid \u00a3415m to US regulators, and as banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS brace for a wave of fines in coming days for attempting to rig Libor following the \u00a3290m penalty slapped on Barclays in June. Gulliver was promoted to chief executive two years ago during a management reshuffle caused by the decision by Lord Green, the chairman, to quit to join the government as a trade minister. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which Green represents, said: \"The report by the US Senate sub-committee sets out in detail the evidence submitted to it and the action taken by HSBC to ensure compliance with US regulations at the time that Lord Green was group chairman.

      "standfirst": "Investors lifted by Greek debt deal and hopes for US budget talks, but uncertainties temper gains", 
      "body": "<p>Leading shares have edged higher to come within 40 points or so of March's peak for the year.</p> <p>Reports that Greece had successfully bought back enough bonds to trigger its latest bailout payment helped sentiment, as did better than expected German confidence figures, a smooth Spanish bond auction and growing hopes of a resolution to the US fiscal cliff.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 3.34 points higher at 5924.97, although it was off its best levels as nervousness was not far away from the fragile optimism. The March peak was 5965.</p> <p>But <strong>Tullow Oil</strong> missed out on the rally, falling 106p to \u00a311.50, despite the company making moves to refocus its business.</p> <p>It said it would sell some north sea gas assets, as well as buying Norway's Spring Energy to boost its oil business.</p> <p>But investors focused instead on production news from Ghana, with a disappointing update from its Okure-1 well where it encountered \"low net to gross oil\", its third successive dry well. On the Spring purchase, analyst Simon Hawkins at N+1 Singer said:</p> <blockquote> The acquisition is a positive step forward in that it allows the company to focus on what it does best, i.e. high-impact exploration and shows that Tullow is actively managing its portfolio. Specifically it builds the company's ability to grow in Norway. Given the core focus of the company on basin opening high-impact exploration its UK assets have always felt non-core. The structure of the deal appears to give away some of the exploration prize. </blockquote> <p>Mining group <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> lost 10.1p to 266.1p as Citigroup cut its recommendation from neutral to sell, and its price target from 350p to 170p, on worries about the mining group's debt:</p> <blockquote> We are increasingly concerned with ENRC's leverage. We expect ENRC's 2012 net debt to reach $5bn, from $3.9bn at the third quarter. ENRC's net debt has risen from around $150m in the first half of 2011 largely due to capital expenditure, acquisitions and settlements for its African copper business. We see net debt at $5.5bn by the first half of 2013, which would be a breach of its three times net debt/EBITDA covenant. <br> Due to our concerns over leverage, negative earnings momentum and our expectation of a covenant breach, we cut our estimates and downgrade to sell. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Whitbread</strong> was 60p higher at \u00a324.88 following <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/dec/11/costa-coffee-sales-starbucks\" title=\"\">a positive update,</a> but drinks giant <strong>Diageo</strong> fell 31p to 1855.5p after it ended talks to buy Jose Cuervo, the world's number one tequila brand.</p> <p>Diageo had been expected to take a stake in the business, owned by the Beckmann family, with a view to taking full control later. The UK group is the brand's main distributor outside Mexico, but it has now confirmed the deal has fallen through, and the distribution agreement will now run out in June 2013. Analysts believe Diageo may now focus on growing its tequila brand Don Julio, although some believe it may turn its attention to US group Beam which has the number two tequila brand, Sauza.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, <strong>Domino Printing</strong> dropped 39p to 571p after a 10% fall in full year profits to \u00a353.7m, partly due to lower sales in Europe due to the eurozone crisis and in China as its economy cooled. The company said:</p> <blockquote> We leave 2012 as we entered it with a combination of uncertainty and instability in world markets. We remain cautious about market conditions and their impact on the investment plans of our customers. </blockquote> <p>There was also disappointment that TEN Media, where Domino has an investment, had not progressed further with an egg tracing system for the US market, which would use the company's products for coding. Domino said \"timing of the roll-out programme remains uncertain.\" Andy Douglas at Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote> A key focus for investors will be on the TEN Media update, in our view, with management indicating that the validation process is taking longer than was previously expected.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares have edged higher to come within 40 points or so of March's peak for the year. Reports that Greece had successfully bought back enough bonds to trigger its latest bailout payment helped sentiment, as did better than expected German confidence figures, a smooth Spanish bond auction and growing hopes of a resolution to the US fiscal cliff. The FTSE 100 finished 3.34 points higher at 5924.97, although it was off its best levels as nervousness was not far away from the fragile optimism. The March peak was 5965. But Tullow Oil missed out on the rally, falling 106p to \u00a311.50, despite the company making moves to refocus its business. It said it would sell some north sea gas assets, as well as buying Norway's Spring Energy to boost its oil business. But investors focused instead on production news from Ghana, with a disappointing update from its Okure-1 well where it encountered \"low net to gross oil\", its third successive dry well. On the Spring purchase, analyst Simon Hawkins at N+1 Singer said: The acquisition is a positive step forward in that it allows the company to focus on what it does best, i.e. high-impact exploration and shows that Tullow is actively managing its portfolio. Specifically it builds the company's ability to grow in Norway. Given the core focus of the company on basin opening high-impact exploration its UK assets have always felt non-core. The structure of the deal appears to give away some of the exploration prize. Mining group Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation lost 10.1p to 266.1p as Citigroup cut its recommendation from neutral to sell, and its price target from 350p to 170p, on worries about the mining group's debt: We are increasingly concerned with ENRC's leverage. We expect ENRC's 2012 net debt to reach $5bn, from $3.9bn at the third quarter. ENRC's net debt has risen from around $150m in the first half of 2011 largely due to capital expenditure, acquisitions and settlements for its African copper business. We see net debt at $5.5bn by the first half of 2013, which would be a breach of its three times net debt/EBITDA covenant. Due to our concerns over leverage, negative earnings momentum and our expectation of a covenant breach, we cut our estimates and downgrade to sell. Elsewhere Whitbread was 60p higher at \u00a324.88 following a positive update, but drinks giant Diageo fell 31p to 1855.5p after it ended talks to buy Jose Cuervo, the world's number one tequila brand. Diageo had been expected to take a stake in the business, owned by the Beckmann family, with a view to taking full control later. The UK group is the brand's main distributor outside Mexico, but it has now confirmed the deal has fallen through, and the distribution agreement will now run out in June 2013. Analysts believe Diageo may now focus on growing its tequila brand Don Julio, although some believe it may turn its attention to US group Beam which has the number two tequila brand, Sauza. Among the mid-caps, Domino Printing dropped 39p to 571p after a 10% fall in full year profits to \u00a353.7m, partly due to lower sales in Europe due to the eurozone crisis and in China as its economy cooled. The company said: We leave 2012 as we entered it with a combination of uncertainty and instability in world markets. We remain cautious about market conditions and their impact on the investment plans of our customers. There was also disappointment that TEN Media, where Domino has an investment, had not progressed further with an egg tracing system for the US market, which would use the company's products for coding. Domino said \"timing of the roll-out programme remains uncertain.\" Andy Douglas at Jefferies said: A key focus for investors will be on the TEN Media update, in our view, with management indicating that the validation process is taking longer than was previously expected. This is currently two to three months behind schedule, and although factory acceptance tests are commencing, validation is still expected and management are still upbeat about the project, the timing of the roll-out programme is described by management as 'uncertain'. There is likely to be some disappointment in this update, which due to the complexity of the engineering process has seen a further shift to the right in terms of timing.

But for some strange reason, there are lots of people who just don't \"Get It\" and believe that Father Christmas is make-believe. Strangely, a lot of these people also think Italian politics are a mess, and the Euro Zone is deeply flawed, set to remain so until there's a growth strategy and an awful lot more political union. Bah Humbug, I say to them all.</p> <p>But just suppose there were evidence of the non-existence of Father Christmas. The non-believers would charge around screaming 'I told you so' at the top of their voices and the press would scatter headlines around saying \"Father Christmas is a myth\" and the children would cry. But the rest of us, who know father Christmas is real but magic - and therefore impossible to disprove, would shrug our shoulders and have another mince pie.</p> <p>And so it is with the Great Italian Political Crisis. Berlusconi returns. Monti announces he will resign and hold (slightly) early elections and the cynics jump up and down. The newspapers fret about a return to full-blown crisis.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, he says, the euro hasn't crashed, and the difference (spread) between the yield on German and Italian bonds hasn't risen above 3.5%...</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Because all the doomsayers were short anyway, and the rest of us, who by some mysterious magical process just know it'll all be all right (because the other Mario [Draghi] says it will be, for starters) are busy hunting yield.</p> <p>There's a 3yr auction in Italy tomorrow (and 2s, 5s and longs in Spain ) so hurdles remain in our way, but this morning, markets are optimistic about BOJ easing (no hard news, just a mood thing) and about a Fiscal Cliff deal (likewise, no hard news, just a hope thing). Chinese tax receipts were strong, Manpower surveys were OK across Asia, economic recovery signs emerging.</p> <p>There's ZEW in Germany, Trade data in the US, and<br>too much money chasing yield for comfort.

Last week the ECB seemed to be hinting negative rates were a possibility. Praet told the Journal: We are technically ready for a negative deposit rate. But we have little experience with negative interest rates. He refused to be drawn on when the ECB's OMT bond buying plan might be used: The decision for program is up to the governments. If I had to take the decision it would be better to take it in quiet times than under stress. Full transcript here. And with that, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for the comments, and we'll be back tomorrow to cover all the latest developments. European markets have ended on a positive note, with Greece getting its bond buyback away, a reasonable Spanish bond auction and hopes for a resolution to America's budget impasse. \u2022 The FTSE 100 edged closer to March's peak, up 3.34 points to 5924.97 \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.78% \u2022 France's Cac has climbed 0.94% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is 1.51% better \u2022 Spain's Ibex has added 1.49% \u2022 The Athen's market has climbed 2.28% \u2022 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 115 points higher, up 0.87% ECB member Ewald Nowotny, the Austrian central bank governor, has added his voice to those saying Italy must continue its reform programme. Following Mario Monti's decision to resign as Italy's prime minister and the subsequent political uncertainty, he told the Wiener Zeitung: There is now renewed mistrust by the financial markets of Italy and the current development has caused considerable uncertainty. I hope that the new government continues the course of reform. Here's a schedule of the Ecofin and Eurogroup meetings tomorrow and Thursday (PDF), courtesy of the FT's Peter Spiegel. With US markets buoyed by hopes of a resolution to the US budget problems, the so called fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax rises, speaker of the House John Boehner has been addressing the House of Representatives. Our US colleagues are following the latest developments on their blog here. Bit of a dispute going on about whether the Greek buyback did achieve its targets or not. News from Spain, with an update on the \"bad bank\" set up to manage toxic property loans built up by the country's lenders. First the bad news. BBVA will not participate in the bad bank, according to Reuters. The rest of the banking sector will have a stake in the bank in proportion to their asset market share. Santander and Caixabank will invest \u20ac600m to \u20ac700m each, according to Reuters. Insurers and other investors will put in \u20ac500m. And just when you thought the Greek bond buyback was a success, apparently not so much. According to flashes on Reuters, the ubiquitous \"eurozone source\" has said the higher than expected cost of the buyback means the country's debt level is not on target. The flashes: \u2022 Average price at Greek debt buybak was 33.5 cents on the euro \u2022 Debt buyback to reduce Greek debt level to 126.6% of GDP by 2020, short of 124% goal \u2022 Higher than expected cost of buyback means operation falls short by around \u20ac450m \u2022 Eurozone finance ministers to discuss next steps in conference call on Tuesday evening Make your own jokes about the Italian government running out of fuel.... Petrol station workers in Italy have called a two day strike about contracts and subsidies on payments by credit card. Markets seem in a perky mood after the Greek debt news and, earlier, positive German confidence figures. There is also the hope that the US budget talks - to avert the so-called fiscal cliff of tax rises and spending cuts due to come into force next month - can be resolved. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said: The return of US politicians to Washington today offers hope that progress might be made on the fiscal cliff. We have been mercifully free of unguarded pronouncements over the past few days, which has certainly contributed to the quiet atmosphere. However, as time ticks away investors will begin to get impatient if no deal is forthcoming. That optimism has pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average nearly 100 points higher, while European markets are also heading higher. In the UK the FTSE 100 is just 30 points shy of its high for the year, achieved in March. This is all ahead of the two day US Federal Reserve meeting starting later, with talk (optimistic or not) of further quantitative easing. So for a post-lunch round-up... Greece has secured a debt deal, buying back \u20ac31.5bn worth of bonds for around a third their face value. (see 1.32pm) Former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi is setting out his stall for the forthcoming elections, branding Mario Monti as \"too German\" and saying the economy is in a worse state now than when he quit. (see 10.33am) German investor confidence has shot up, suggesting the eurozone's biggest economy is not heading into a recession. (see 10.17am) Markets are rallying, with shares up across Europe and bond yields down. (see 2.14pm) And with that I will leave you in the capable hands of my colleague Nick Fletcher. Even the bonds of the crisis-hit countries are rallying, with Greece and Portugal huge beneficiaries of the buoyant market. The yield on Greece's 10-year government bond dropped 70bps to 13.4%, while the yield on Portugal's 10-year eased 12bps to 7.4%. Meanwhile, Italian bond yields are still down on the day. The yield on the 10-year government bond is 6bps lower at 4.76%. Spanish bonds, which were hit by the turbulence surrounding Italy yesterday, have also seen their yields ease. The yield on the 10-year bond is 7bps lower at 5.5%. In the equity markets, shares are up across Europe, boosted by a cheery investor confidence survey from Germany. UK FTSE 100: up 0.14%, or 8 points, at 5930 Italy FTSE MIB: up 1.24% Spain IBEX: up 0.9% Germany DAX: up 0.6% France CAC 40: up 0.8% While we're on the topic of Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor has said she is confident that the Italian people will chose to continue reforms set in place by Mario Monti when they vote in the upcoming elections. I support the reforms launched by Mario Monti's government, which have led to financial investors regaining some confidence in Italy, so I am sure the Italian people will vote in such a way that Italy stays on the right path. But, a new Harris poll for the FT suggests Berlusconi is hitting a nerve with his anti-German rhetoric. Peter Spiegel wrote this blogpost on the results: Fully 83% of [the Italians] polled believe Germany\u2019s influence in the EU is \u201ctoo strong\u201d \u2013 the same total as Spaniards, but a stunning jump since October 2011 when only 53% of Italians felt that way. In addition, 74% of Italians feel that Germany is showing \u201cnot enough\u201d solidarity with the rest of the eurozone, while 55% of Germans say they\u2019re already showing \u201ctoo much\u201d. And Berlusconi is still at it, making some feisty statements on his Facebook page (link for those who want a new friend). The former Italian PM says the 'spread thing' (we're talking about the difference in yields here, not Monti's grandson) was made up to pressure Italy and benefit Germany. Germany sold Italian bonds so other investors would follow. [To recap, by selling bonds, bond prices fall and yields go up. High yields suggest a country is more likely to default, i.e. investors demand higher levels of interest to hold their debt. More in the eurozone crisis glossary.] And, in a quote that may define the upcoming elections, Berlusconi says: Monti is a German lackey, while I always stood up to Merkel. Now a story from Italy that sounds like a hoax, but isn't, apparently. Prime minister Mario Monti has admitted that his youngest grandson in nicknamed 'spread' at school, according to Reuters. Where Italy is concerned, the spread is the difference in yield on Italian and German government bonds, i.e. a measure of the perceived likelihood that Italy will default. Monti is reported as saying: The sins of the grandparents are visited on their grandchildren. Across the pond, the US trade balance is in and it is pretty much line with expectations at -$42.2bn in October, compared with expectations of -$42.7bn. The trade gap widened 4.9%. Exports suffered the biggest drop in nearly four years, down 3.6%. While imports dropped 2.1% to their lowest level in one and a half years. Exports have been supporting the economy since the recession ended. Their decline reflect slowing global demand from China and Europe. The US also posted a record trade deficit of $29.5bn with China. We'll have reaction to that as it comes in. And Greece has beaten its buyback target, according to NET TV. Greek bankers told Reuters that total offers in the buyback reached \u20ac31.5bn. We'll have reaction to that from our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, shortly. As expected (see 11.56am), Greek banks had to step in to make up the difference between the \u20ac26.5bn that had been reached on Friday and the \u20ac30bn target. This operation will mean Greece can now receive a new tranche of funding from the IMF and the EU and will lower the cost of debt for the country. All in all, good news. Meanwhile, Greek pharmacists are protesting in Athens against the ministry's threat to fully liberalize their sector and demanding the payment of debts owed by the National Organization for Healthcare Provision. Pharmacists are refusing to give medicines on credit to insured customers with the National Organization for Healthcare Provision until all debts have been settled. So the deadline for Greece's cut-price debt buyback is fast approaching and Athens is expected to have met its target of 'retiring' \u20ac30bn worth of bonds. Greece plans to buy back the debt for \u20ac10bn, at about a third of face value, paying with money the country has borrowed from Europe\u2019s bailout fund. To recap, Reuters reported last night that a total of \u20ac26.5bn was tendered at an average price of 33.4% of face value by the close of play on Friday, citing a senior eurozone official. Senior banking executives told the agency that Greek banks, who had only tendered about 60% percent of their roughly \u20ac17bn in sovereign debt holdings by Friday, are expected to offer more to ensure the buyback hits its targets. One banker at a major Greek bank said: All banks will support the buyback, topping up their offers. The target of 30 billion euros will be reached and may be exceeded. But Ben Vickers at Bloomberg suggests some of the biggest winners could be investors who hold onto their Greek bonds. He writes: At each step it looks increasingly likely that Greece will remain in the euro and eventually pay off its debts \u2014 so, although not all agree, those who hang on may get a much higher proportion of the bonds\u2019 face value back. Hans Humes, president of the New York-based Greylock Capital Management LLC, said his hedge fund would be tendering only part of its Greek debt because it\u2019s \u201cgoing to be a very good investment.\u201d The yield on Greek debt holdings, he said, \u201cis extremely high and exceeds anything else in Europe.\u201d \u201cThe rational investor will hold out,\u201d Nomura Holdings Inc.\u2019s Dimitris Drakopoulos and Lefteris Farmakis wrote in a report on Nov. 30. The Greek government never explained why it had to extend the deadline for the buyback to today. It would be ironic that the extension was due to foreign investors\u2019 reluctance to sell Greek bonds, believing greater returns are to be had in coming years \u2014 therefore forcing Greek banks and pension funds to tender more of their own holdings. Taking another look at the much better than expected German investor confidence survey (see 10.17am) Capital Economics rather downplays the numbers. Jennifer McKeown writes: December\u2019s rise in ZEW investor sentiment provides only limited hope for the German economy given clear signs of a downturn in the recent hard data and the latest developments in Greece and Italy. The fact that the index is in positive territory means that the majority of respondents expects German economic conditions to improve in the next six months. This seems particularly encouraging given that, unlike most of the euro-zone, Germany has so far achieved positive growth in every quarter this year. But note that the ZEW has never been a reliable predictor of GDP growth. (See Chart.) October\u2019s hard data on trade and industrial production suggest that the economy is very likely to contract in Q4 and the business surveys also paint a gloomy picture. In France, president Francois Hollande said yesterday that the crisis is \"behind us\". Hans-Werner Sinn, a German economist and president of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research would disagree, arguing that France faces a 10-year downturn. According to calculations by Goldman Sachs, France today is just as overpriced as Spain. Both countries must be around 20% cheaper to make their economies competitive and to achieve debt sustainability. But to be 20% cheaper, the real devaluation process won't be easy. This is why France must undergo a slump of a decade in which its inflation rate would be lagging by 2% behind the average of the remaining eurozone. In spite of all that, France has not come yet under a bailout program. He says things are not so bad that the markets are expecting France to go bankrupt. I don't agree that France will go through this path given that in a way or another, it is already under the euro rescue package since the German capital largely flowed over France through Southern Europe. The exposure of French banks before the rescue measures computed relative to the size of the country was twice as large as the German. The Greek aid deal last week didn't only bailout Greece but also France. Over to Greece, again, where our correspondent Helena Smith says the crisis in Italy has sparked widespread fears about the debt-stricken country\u2019s plight. Helena writes: Greek officials have been watching the ructions in Italy anxiously. With the country yet to receive a euro from the \u20ac44.6bn bumper packet of rescue loans put on hold since June, the prospect of trouble in the eurozone\u2019s third biggest economy has been met with barely concealed fright. \u201cIf Italy were to be forced to ask for money from the ESM it would be very difficult for institutions of the European Union to cope with the crisis,\u201d said the former government spokesman and prominent political commentator Pandelis Kapsis. \u201cIt is creating uncertainty and if there isn\u2019t a political solution, the possibility of Italy being forced to ask for rescue funds [as a result of market pressure] will become very real.\u201d With Europe\u2019s \u20ac500bn new bailout mechanism widely regarded as being far from adequate to cope with propping up Italy and Spain in addition to Greece, Portugal and Ireland, officials worry that competition for the funds will rise dramatically. \u201cThat will undoubtedly be very difficult for us,\u201d Kapsis told me. Using the occasion of the Nobel peace prize ceremony, the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, highlighted growing fears that without an urgent injection of liquidity, the country\u2019s cash-strapped market could see unemployment (already at a European record of 26%) skyrocket. \u201cAnd that could trigger extremist phenomena, politically, that would impact the rest of Europe,\u201d the conservative leader told fellow EU heads of state at last night\u2019s celebratory dinner in Oslo. Anxiety is being driven not only by the prospect of the potential aid pool drying up. Officials also worry that the turmoil in Italy could be the death knell for potential investors just as the debt-stricken nation launches its ambitious privatisation programme. \u201cThe uncertainty could put off investors being lured to Europe\u2019s entire southern periphery,\u201d said political analyst Dimitris Tsiodras. We've got some analyst reaction to those perky German investor confidence numbers. Christian Schulz of Berenberg Bank writes: Signs of an economic turn-around in Germany get stronger as the November downturn in German investor confidence turns out to have been a blip. In December, the important expectations component of the ZEW index resumed the uptrend which began in September, jumping to positive territory to 6.9 from -15.7 for the first time since May 2012. Financial analysts now expect the economy to improve over the next months, in line with our expectation that the German economy can return to expansion in spring. Investors interpret the current state of the economy as stagnation rather than contraction. ZEW is certainly optimistic. It says the world economy will gather strength next year; the US labour market is surprisingly strong and there is some hope regarding China. Also, that the ECB and Bundesbank forecasts are pessimistic. More news from Italy and Silvio Berlusconi's fiery interview this morning. Our correspondent Tom Kington reports from Rome: A day after Silvio Berlusconi claimed any criticism of his comeback concealed a hidden attack on Italian companies (including his own, presumably), the former prime minister stepped up his anti-markets rhetoric on Tuesday, suggesting he plans a fiery election campaign, with international finance cast as the enemy of honest Italians. Speaking to one of his TV stations this morning, Berlusconi said, \u201cWhat does the spread matter to us?\u201d referring to the measurement of the difference between Italian and German bonds which is used to indicate market confidence in the Italian economy. The spread, he added, was \u201ca trick,\" which had been used to \"bring down\" the government he led until November 2011. Since Berlusconi threw his hat back in the ring the spread has shot up from 323 to around 350, revealing alarm at his return and at the decision by Mario Monti to resign. This came in addition to his comments that Monti\u2019s market pleasing austerity measures have \u201cpushed Italy into recession\u201d, and were \u201cGerman-centric.\u201d Also speaking on Italian TV this morning, Monti warned Italians not to be fooled by \u201cmagic solutions\u201d as the country gears up for February elections, a clear reference to Berlusconi. Yesterday Monti said: \u201cI believe that Italians are mature and will not believe in unrealistic promises, and I believe this maturity has grown in time, hence the understanding they have shown of sacrifices in the last year.\u201d Good news from Germany where investor confidence is up, contrary to all expectations. There was a big improvement in the German ZEW investor confidence survey, which rose to 6.9 in December, compared with expectations of -11.5, and way higher than November's reading of -15.7. It is the first positive reading since May. A ZEW economist says the picture demonstrates Germany is not heading into a recession. Meanwhile, back in Ireland, Irish communications minister Pat Rabitte has stood by his assertion that the government will not pay back the \u20ac3bn of IOUs to Anglo Irish Bank, which is due in March. Our Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald reports: Rabbitte has said he stands by remarks made this weekend that the Irish government would not pay the IOU's owned on the now nationalised Anglo Irish Bank. The Labour Party minister said the coalition would not pay the next instalment of the so-called promissory notes to investors and bond holders. Rabbitte said: \u201c[The Government] didn\u2019t pay the promissory note this year and as far as I\u2019m concerned we\u2019re not going to pay it next year. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t pay. This was an IOU entered into by the previous government when the Anglo Irish Bank collapsed and the notion of us paying it next March doesn\u2019t arise.\u201d But Taoiseach Enda Kenny struck a much more cautious tone when asked about Rabitte's remarks. The next payment is due in March next year. Our focus is on having a deal done before then \u2014 on re-engineering and restructuring before then so it won\u2019t have to be paid. I assume he is referring to the politics of this, and this is where our focus has been \u2014 with the Department of Finance, the ECB, and officials at European level \u2014 to have a decision on restructuring and reengineering the promissory notes before March. We'll have more on that story, as it happens. Thanks to KhakiSuit for the query. Back in the debt markets, Spain has sold some short-term government treasury bills at lower yields than in November. It sold \u20ac1.5bn 18-month bills with a yield of 2.78% compared with 3.03% in November. It sold \u20ac2.39bn 12-month bills at a yield of 2.56% compared with 2.8% previously. Gloomy news from Ireland, where a fifth of all households are jobless. Henry McDonald, Ireland correspondent, reports: A fifth of all households in Ireland are jobless with the rate double the average across Europe, a new report released in Dublin reveals today. The Republic's Economic and Social Research Institute has found that 22% of Irish citizens are living in a jobless household. It reports that there has been a huge leap in jobless households from 15% in 2007 to 22% in 2010 as the recession began to bite in Ireland. It says the high rate was partly due to the level of unemployment, but jobless adults in Ireland were more likely to live with children. And the risk of living in a jobless household was higher for people with low levels of education, in lone-parent households and in households where an adult had a disability. Commenting on the findings, Ireland's minister for social protection Joan Burton said: \"I am particularly concerned about the situation of children living in jobless households. \"There are grave social and economic risks in letting almost a quarter of Irish children grow up in jobless households. \"These risks include child poverty, limited educational achievements and ultimately, the intergenerational transmission of unemployment and poverty. Italian markets are certainly looking up, with the main share index, the FTSE MIB, now up by 0.6%, or 92 points at 15443. The yield (effectively the interest rate) on 10-year government bonds has also started coming down, down 13bps at 4.8%. With the impending political instability in Italy, it is surprising markets haven't reacted more dramatically. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains that it's all to do with Father Christmas. For the sake of clarity, and before my children read this, of course Father Christmas is 'real'. But for some strange reason, there are lots of people who just don't \"Get It\" and believe that Father Christmas is make-believe. Strangely, a lot of these people also think Italian politics are a mess, and the Euro Zone is deeply flawed, set to remain so until there's a growth strategy and an awful lot more political union. Bah Humbug, I say to them all. But just suppose there were evidence of the non-existence of Father Christmas. The non-believers would charge around screaming 'I told you so' at the top of their voices and the press would scatter headlines around saying \"Father Christmas is a myth\" and the children would cry. But the rest of us, who know father Christmas is real but magic - and therefore impossible to disprove, would shrug our shoulders and have another mince pie. And so it is with the Great Italian Political Crisis. Berlusconi returns. Monti announces he will resign and hold (slightly) early elections and the cynics jump up and down. The newspapers fret about a return to full-blown crisis. But, he says, the euro hasn't crashed, and the difference (spread) between the yield on German and Italian bonds hasn't risen above 3.5%... Because all the doomsayers were short anyway, and the rest of us, who by some mysterious magical process just know it'll all be all right (because the other Mario [Draghi] says it will be, for starters) are busy hunting yield. There's a 3yr auction in Italy tomorrow (and 2s, 5s and longs in Spain ) so hurdles remain in our way, but this morning, markets are optimistic about BOJ easing (no hard news, just a mood thing) and about a Fiscal Cliff deal (likewise, no hard news, just a hope thing). Chinese tax receipts were strong, Manpower surveys were OK across Asia, economic recovery signs emerging. There's ZEW in Germany, Trade data in the US, and too much money chasing yield for comfort. As for the Euro, sell it in a few months, not today. Over in Greece there are reports that the group of eurozone finance ministers \u2013 known as the Eurogroup \u2013 are set to hold a teleconference this afternoon, after the debt buyback deadline. ekathimerini reports: Euro area finance ministers will be discussing later on Tuesday a scheme launched by Greece to buy back sovereign bonds that's crucial to unlocking aid from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. The Eurogroup will be holding a teleconference \u00abin the late afternoon,\u00bb according to sources, after the close of the extended deadline for investors. Some quotes from Monti's interview on state television RAI. Politics is above all a question of culture, that is, trying to give direction to people's ideas. I think I did it when I was a professor, I'm trying to do it in this brief period when I'm prime minister, I'm sure that whatever hat I'm wearing in future, I will continue to do it. As for the rest... He leaves the sentence unfinished. He also said the government has made very great progress in a short time in tackling the crisis. He says Italy has to continue with economic reforms. Meanwhile, Monti's given another opaque response to questions about whether he will run. Italian shares have been yoyoing up and down this morning, with the FTSE MIB dropping -0.5% at one point and then back to neutral. It is now down by 0.2%. Yields (effectively the interest rate) on 10-year government bonds are heading north, currently around 5bps higher at 4.88%. More news from Italy, where Silvio Berlusconi has accused Mario Monti of being \"too German\", as he gears up for a bitter election campaign. Speaking on his own Canale 5 television, the former prime minister criticised Monti for pursuing economic policies dictated by Germany that had dragged Italy into recession. The Monti government has followed the Germano-centric poliicies which Europe has tried to impose on other states and it has created a crisis situation which is much worse than where we were when we were in government. Elsewhere in the FT, vice-president of the European Commission Olli Rehn writes that Europe must stay the austerity course. He notes that so far the correction of current account imbalances has happened mainly in the deficit countries \"but this is no surprise given the scale of the challenges they face\". However, he says, surplus countries must also do their bit. The European Commission has said surplus countries should implement reforms to strengthen domestic demand. Germany could do this by opening up its services market and by encouraging wages to rise in line with productivity. He goes on to insist that the growth and stability pact takes account of evolving economic conditions, citing the changes made to bailout programmes in Greece, Portugal and Spain. But, he says, the eurozone must stay the course and rebalance its books. In order to overcome the crisis and restore confidence, we must continue to remove structural obstacles to sustainable growth and employment; pursue prudent fiscal consolidation; and turn bold thoughts into convincing actions when redesigning and rebuilding our economic and monetary union. In short, we need to stay the course and pursue decisive reforms in our member states and deeper integration in the eurozone. First a look at the papers and the FT is reporting that Mario Monti is in talks with centrist groups urging him to stand in Italy\u2019s elections early next year. Guy Dinmore, Richard Milne and Giulia Segreti write: Amid revived concern in Brussels and among investors that Italy could forsake its recent reforms, centrist politicians were in talks with him encouraging him to stand as a candidate. He was said to be in discussions with Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the head of Ferrari who launched a political movement last month, and Pier Ferdinando Casini, leader of the centrist Catholic UDC party. Centrist politicians said they expected Mr Monti to give his answer within a week. If he decided to run as their candidate he would make a formal declaration after parliament approves the 2013 budget law, possibly in the week before Christmas. As my colleague Graeme Wearden reported yesterday, Monti ducked a question on whether he might run as a candidate. He told reporters he was \"not considering this particular issue at this stage\", which is a very political answer for a man supposed to be an economist rather than a politician. Elsewhere, there's a key economic confidence survey out of Germany and the Italian finance minister is speaking in parliament. France non-farm payrolls for Q3: 6.30am UK OBR officials testify on Osborne's autumn statement: 9.30am Italian finance minister Grilli speaks in parliament: 9.30am German ZEW economic sentiment survey for December: 10am Eurozone ZEW survey for December: 10am EU's Barroso takes qustions: 11am US trade balance for October: 1.30pm In the debt markets, Austria is selling government bonds; Belgium is selling 3 and 12-month treasury certificates; Spain will sell 12 and 18-month bills; and the USA is selling 4 and 52-week bills and 3-year notes. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. Greece will be hoping to meet its target to retire \u20ac30bn worth of bonds by midday today, having extended the deadline from last Friday. It was getting close yesterday, having bought back a total of \u20ac26.5bn, on average at a third of their face value. We'll be reporting on how it gets on. There will doubtless be more news out of Italy, after prime minister Mario Monti promised over the weekend to resign as soon as next year's budget has been approved by parliament.",

      "bodyText": "A blunder in the wording of loan statements by the nationalised part of Northern Rock will cost the taxpayer \u00a3270m as customers are refunded an average of \u00a31,775 for the error. Up to 152,000 customers stand to receive the windfall \u2013 largely through lower borrowing costs on existing loans \u2013 which will increase the government's debt this year. The problems took place at Northern Rock Asset Management (NRAM), the part of Northern Rock that remains nationalised. Loan statements sent to customers failed to include the original amount which had been borrowed. The oversight was uncovered by the new state-owned body, UK Asset Resolution (UKAR), which now owns NRAM and the nationalised mortgages of Bradford &amp; Bingley. The Treasury, which is picking up the bill for the long-standing error, said letters sent to customers were not compliant with wording set out in the Consumer Credit Act (CCA), which requires such letters to contain three amounts: the original sum borrowed, the opening balance and the closing balance. The NRAM letters did not include the first number. The \u00a3270m figure covers the amount of interest paid by customers during the period from October 2009 when the changes to the law came into effect. Sajid Javid, the economic secretary to the Treasury, said in a written ministerial statement. \"In selected letters and customer account statements, certain paragraphs of mandatory wording were written incorrectly and compulsory information about the amount of credit was not included in the statements. The CCA provides that a lender is restricted in how it can enforce a debt and borrowers are not liable for interest, over the period during which the lender has not provided the specified information.\" While customers had not lost out financially, they would be provided with \"restitution\" because of mistakes in the letters. Unsecured loans of \u00a325,000 or less are covered by the CCA and some of the problems occurred on the unsecured part of the Together mortgages sold by the bank. Richard Banks, the chief executive of UKAR, said: \"We will be writing to all customers who are affected and advising them on next steps. We have not received any complaints or claims as a result of this matter and as far as we are aware it has not resulted in financial loss for customers.\" UKAR, which informed the Treasury of its fears about the mistakes in October, has hired accountants from Deloitte to investigate what went wrong and make recommendations to ensure similar errors do not happen again. The problem was uncovered by a junior member of staff earlier in the year and banks urged customers not to deploy the services of the claims management companies which are contacting customers over payment protection insurance compensation. The Office for National Statistics included UKAR in the public sector net borrowing figures for 2012-13 announced by the chancellor George Osborne in last week's autumn statement when he said it would add \u00a370bn to the deficit. Javid confirmed that the \u00a3270m remediation figure was not included in that forecast. \"The impact of these costs on the public finances is a decision for the independent Office for National Statistics.

JLR has started work on a factory in China, to open what would be its first full manufacturing facility outside the UK, and has signalled that the Middle East could be next. The Indian-owned company has agreed to conduct a \"feasibility study\" with Saudi Arabia's National Industrial Clusters Development Program \u2013 a government body charged with securing investment in five industrial sectors including car making. JLR has indicated that its UK expansion, which includes a move to 24-hour operation at its Halewood plant, has reached a limit for now and that it will target overseas markets. Alongside the China operation, JLR operates an assembly plant in India, where parts are shipped in and put together to make cars \u2013 as opposed to the fully integrated process at places like Halewood, where car bodies are stamped out as well. JLR's chief executive, Ralf Speth, said Saudi Arabia was an \"attractive\" option. He added: \"We are committed to further international partnerships to meet record demand for our highly sought after vehicles.\" While JLR's recent UK investments have helped stoke talk of a British manufacturing revival, the company is setting its sights abroad. Speth said in September that JLR must \"go where the markets are\", a strategy that has drawn expressions of concern from Tony Woodley, former joint leader of the Unite trade union. JLR, which has hired an extra 8,000 people in the UK in recent years, owns three car plants in the West Midlands and Merseyside and has announced plans for an engine plant in Wolverhampton. JLR said talks were at a preliminary stage but said the discussions had already identified opportunities in making aluminium components such as car bodies. The world's largest aluminium complex, the Ras Al Khair facility, is due to start production in Saudi Arabia in 2014. However, JLR added: \"Issues such as level of investment, potential capacity and job creation have not yet been discussed in detail between the parties.\" Global retail sales at JLR have risen 32% to more than 324,000 vehicles in the first 11 months of the year, with sales in the Middle East and Africa rising by more than 9% to 11,418 units. China, however, has now become JLR's largest market. Last month JLR and its Chinese partner, Chery, formally laid the foundation stone for a plant in Changshu, near Shanghai, as part of a 10.9bn yuan (\u00a31.1bn) investment that will include a new research centre and an engine production facility.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Costa Coffee sales rose by 7.1% in the last three months against the backdrop of protests and boycotts against its closest rival Starbucks because of the US chain's controversial tax arrangements. \"We have been the UK's favourite coffee shop for some time; we remain the taxman's favourite coffee shop too,\" declared Andy Harrison, chief executive of parent company Whitbread. Harrison said it was impossible to attribute Costa's increasingly strong performance to the controversy surrounding Starbucks's tax affairs, but he noted that Costa had enjoyed a record week last week, with UK stores \u2013 excluding franchised shops \u2013 taking \u00a310m and attracting 3.8m customers. The weather may have played a part too \u2013 cold but dry, a perfect blend for coffee shop sales. Harrison said he had seen the results of a YouGov brand preference survey, conducted at the end of October, shortly after a Reuters report highlighted Starbucks' low UK tax payments. \"They show Starbucks have taken a bit of a knock as a result [of public outrage],\" he said, although he was not able to release the precise figures. More than 40 Starbucks stores were the target of a protest last weekend by UK Uncut. Starbucks's aggressive accounting measures have allowed it to pay just \u00a38.6m in tax since launching in the UK around 14 years ago. Costa UK's accounts for last year showed similar sales, but a tax charge of \u00a315m. Starbucks has also been criticised for plans to pare back staff terms and conditions, including cutting paid lunch breaks, sick leave and maternity benefits for thousands of its British workers. Harrison on Tuesday claimed Whitbread's 40,000 staff were among the most satisfied on the high street and in the hotel industry, with recent workforce surveys suggesting \"employee engagement\" was at record levels. Costa's rise to the title of Britain's largest coffee shop chain \u2013 it now has more than 1,200 outlets in Britain \u2013 has not been without controversy itself,with increasing signs that some communities do not want the near-ubiquitous brand on their high street. In October, Costa ditched plans for a store in Totnes, Devon, in the face of fierce local opposition. Nevertheless, Costa is one of the few high street retailers which still has ambitious plans to add new stores across Britain, creating hundreds of jobs \u2013 particularly for young adults who face the toughest job market in generations. Like-for-like sales growth of 7.1% for Costa in autumn compared with 6.8% growth earlier in the year. Total sales across Costa's global business were up 25.5%, with roaring growth in China easing off \u2013 though remaining in double-digit growth. Harrison said this was slightly better than the experience of other groups such as McDonald's and Yum, the US group behind Taco Bell and KFC. Across the wider Whitbread group, third-quarter comparable sales were up 3.3%, with the group's Premier Inn hotel chain making gains against declining revenues in the hotel industry.",

      "body": "<p>Costa Coffee sales rose by 7.1% in the last three months against the backdrop of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/09/starbucks-deal-international-tax-reform\" title=\"\">protests and boycotts against its closest rival Starbucks</a> because of the US chain's controversial tax arrangements.</p> <p>\"We have been the UK's favourite coffee shop for some time; we remain the taxman's favourite coffee shop too,\" declared Andy Harrison, chief executive of parent company Whitbread.</p> <p>Harrison said it was impossible to attribute Costa's increasingly strong performance to the controversy surrounding Starbucks's tax affairs, but he noted that Costa had enjoyed a record week last week, with UK stores \u2013 excluding franchised shops \u2013 taking \u00a310m and attracting 3.8m customers. The weather may have played a part too \u2013 cold but dry, a perfect blend for coffee shop sales.</p> <p>Harrison said he had seen the results of a YouGov brand preference survey, conducted at the end of October, shortly after a Reuters report highlighted Starbucks' low UK tax payments. \"They show Starbucks have taken a bit of a knock as a result [of public outrage],\" he said, although he was not able to release the precise figures.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/09/starbucks-stores-uk-uncut-protest\" title=\"\">More than 40 Starbucks stores were the target of a protest last weekend by UK Uncut</a>. Starbucks's aggressive accounting measures have allowed it to pay just \u00a38.6m in tax since launching in the UK around 14 years ago. Costa UK's accounts for last year showed similar sales, but a tax charge of \u00a315m.</p> <p>Starbucks has also been criticised for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/03/starbucks-slash-lunch-breaks?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">plans to pare back staff terms and conditions</a>, including cutting paid lunch breaks, sick leave and maternity benefits for thousands of its British workers.</p> <p>Harrison on Tuesday claimed Whitbread's 40,000 staff were among the most satisfied on the high street and in the hotel industry, with recent workforce surveys suggesting \"employee engagement\" was at record levels.</p> <p>Costa's rise to the title of Britain's largest coffee shop chain \u2013 it now has more than 1,200 outlets in Britain \u2013 has not been without controversy itself,with increasing signs that some communities do not want the near-ubiquitous brand on their high street. In October, Costa ditched plans for a store in Totnes, Devon, in the face of fierce local opposition.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Costa is one of the few high street retailers which still has ambitious plans to add new stores across Britain, creating hundreds of jobs \u2013 particularly for young adults who face the toughest job market in generations.</p> <p>Like-for-like sales growth of 7.1% for Costa in autumn compared with 6.8% growth earlier in the year. Total sales across Costa's global business were up 25.5%, with roaring growth in China easing off \u2013 though remaining in double-digit growth. Harrison said this was slightly better than the experience of other groups such as McDonald's and Yum, the US group behind Taco Bell and KFC.</p> <p>Across the wider Whitbread group, third-quarter comparable sales were up 3.3%, with the group's Premier Inn hotel chain making gains against declining revenues in the hotel industry.</p>",
