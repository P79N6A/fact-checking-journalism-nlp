European leaders were pleased at the decision to launch the talks, claiming a successful negotiation could result in a boost to annual EU gross domestic product of around \u20ac70bn (\u00a360bn) or half a percentage point. De Gucht described a potential pact as \"groundbreaking\", while Barroso called it a \"win-win solution\" which could generate a bonanza for the European farming, food and car industries. David Cameron said he would use Britain's chairmanship of the G8 countries this year to push the transatlantic trade agenda. \"It's great that President Obama has set out his determination to agree a trade deal between the EU and the United States,\" said the prime minister.

The US may be storing up the next financial bubble with extra borrowing, but, in the short-term, consumption is boosted. And there are other things going for the US economy, which is investing in new hi-tech equipment despite the attraction of cheap labour to do the work (a robot is expensive to buy, but increases productivity). In Germany, the success of exports negates the need for a domestic consumption rise. The UK's coalition hoped it could follow suit. Cash pulled in from selling stuff abroad would make up for the lack of domestic demand. But alas, the UK is neither borrowing nor exporting more, and is left to flounder with a low-wage economy that simply consumes enough to maintain the UK's current productive capacity. That means unemployment remaining at 2.5 million people and the long-term unemployed being out of work for yet longer. The government is under pressure to increase its own borrowing to make up for the lack of household borrowing and the fall in real wages, primarily by employing more people in the private sector to build bridges, roads and railways. The experience of the pre-crash years is that big infrastructure spending does raise wages and increase consumption. Unfortunately many of those hired are construction workers imported from eastern Europe, which has little impact on unemployment. It shows there are no easy answers for the UK.",

      "bodyText": "More than 3,600 retail jobs are at risk following another dark day for the high street that saw the collapse into administration of fashion chain Republic, the ousting of 325 managers at John Lewis and the closure of a further 164 Blockbuster stores. The surprise job cuts at John Lewis, one of the strongest players on the high street, came as 2,500 jobs were threatened at Republic, and 800 jobs went at Blockbuster, which is already in administration. John Lewis has been held up by deputy prime minister Nick Clegg as a model of \"responsible capitalism\" for the whole economy, and its job cuts will deepen the gloom about the UK's financial trajectory. John Lewis staff, who are known as partners because they get a share of annual profits and can contribute to business decisions, were shocked by the imposition of cuts in the wake of a bumper Christmas. The job losses among the ranks of John Lewis department managers are thought to be the largest since 2009 when 700 in-store call centre employees got the chop and are a blow to John Lewis's benign image. Each John Lewis has about 10 department store managers looking after sections such as womenswear, beauty or furnishings. They are to be replaced by one or two more senior managers in 28 of John Lewis's 40 outlets in a bid to save costs. The cuts are part of John Lewis's Retail Revolution plan. One insider at the company said that jobs had to go in stores because the majority of the company's sales growth was coming online. The managers affected have been given four weeks to put forward their views before a 90-day consultation on job losses starts in March. The cuts at John Lewis come despite expectations that the its parent company, which also owns Waitrose, will reveal \u00a3475m in annual profits on 7 March. Republic, which has 121 stores, was the latest to suffer in the face of online competition and the ailing UK economy. The Leeds-based business appointed Ernst &amp; Young as administrators yesterday and immediately made 150 staff at its head office redundant. It is the latest in a long list of retail failures since Christmas, including Jessops, HMV and Blockbuster, with the total loss of up to 10,000 jobs. Hunter Kelly, joint administrator, said Republic had suffered from a \"very sudden and rapid decline in sales in late January\". Administrators for Blockbuster said they were closing another 164 more stores over the next few weeks, having shuttered 129 shops when it entered adminstration last month. Restructuring specialist GA Europe is believed to be among a number of parties interested in buying the remaining 235-store business, which called in administrators last month. There was one spark of good news at Jessops, the camera retailer. Peter Jones, the Dragons Den entrepreneur who bought the rights to the Jessops name and its website, is rumoured to be interested in taking on a parcel of its stores, potentially as many as 30.",

      "bodyText": "Speaking of Greece, the country has signed a new gas pipeline deal. Helena Smith writes: Greece signed up to what is being touted as the single biggest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) project today agreeing with Italy and Albania to host a pipeline that would deliver gas from the Caspian region to Europe lessening what is widely regarded as the continent's over-reliance on Russia for natural sources of energy. The Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras, who has made attracting international investment to the debt-stricken nation his biggest priority, said the agreement with the Swiss-based Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) would not only create thousands of jobs but \"will upgrade the geo-strategic role of the country in decades to come.\" With the agreement Greece now becomes an integral part of the fourth major gas import corridor for the EU. The deal, which also sees the conduit for Azeri gas going through Albania and under the Adriatic to Italy, is worth \u20ac1.5bn for the crisis-hit country. TAP officials say hosting the pipeline will help give the Greek government the infrastructure so desperately needed to stimulate the euro zone's weakest economy. \"We are very pleased that as international investors in Greece we are able to play a major role in supporting Greece's economic growth,\" said Rickard Scoufias, TAP's country manager in Greece. And with that, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow to track all the day's developments. On Greece Olli Rehn said a great amount had been achieved in terms of fiscal consolidation and the implementation of growth enhancing reforms. December's eurogroup agreement had removed the damaging uncertainty hanging over the country and paved the way for a return of confidence. It was now up to the Greek authorities to ensure though determined implementation of the reform programme that the confidence continues to grow, he said. European Commission vice president Olli Rehn has written to EU finance ministers with \"some reflections on issues related to fiscal policies and growth, following a discussion on these matters at their meeting the previous day.\"The letter is available on the EC site here but a former colleague picks out a key line: It's been another positive day for European markets despite an early fall on Wall Street, and UK shares shying away from a new five year high. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 20.73 points higher at 6359.11, up 0.33% \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.67% \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.32% higher \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB rose 0.41% \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 0.87% higher \u2022 In Athens, the market added 0.53% \u2022 But in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 0.32% in early trading Europe needs a banking union, says a new report from the IMF: A banking union for the euro area would provide an integrated approach to oversee the safety and stability of the financial system as a whole. According to a new paper from International Monetary Fund staff, a successful banking union should eventually include three key elements: a single supervisory mechanism to oversee the rules and contain the buildup of risks; a single resolution authority to deal with weak or failing banks; and common safety nets to sustain depositor confidence in the event of shocks. Here's another take on the G7's confusing comments on currencies yesterday, from Pimco chief executive Mohamed El-Erian. The pope's resignation could have an unintended consequence, it appears, with regards to the forthcoming Italian election. Bloomberg reports: Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's surge in support before elections this month may be damped by Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s resignation, which is dominating media coverage in Italy during the run-up period in which opinion polls are banned. \u201cThe electoral campaign ended at 11:46 a.m.\u201d on Feb. 11, said pollster and political commentator Luigi Crespi, referring to the time of the pope\u2019s announcement. News about Benedict\u2019s decision, which makes him the first pope to resign in almost 600 years, has dominated print and television news coverage, overshadowing the election campaign less than two weeks before the Feb. 24-25 vote. The pontiff\u2019s announcement came two days after the start of a poll blackout designed to keep surveys from influencing voters before election day. The ban will make it difficult to gauge the impact of Benedict\u2019s resignation on the race. \u201cBerlusconi needs broad media coverage to regain votes because, looking at the polls, if elections were held today he\u2019d lose,\" Giovanni Orsina, a professor at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome, said by phone yesterday. \u201cThe fact that the media are busy with something else for sure can hurt him.\u201d The European Central Bank's bond buying plan - its outright monetary transactions programme - was a bold move which worked better than \"might have been expected\". That's the view of US Federal Reserve policymaker James Bullard, president of the St Louis fed. In a speech to a conference in Arkansas, he said the calmer condition in Europe was a key reason for the improved global outlook and should aid growth elsewhere. According to Reuters he said: This year seems to be characterised by less macroeconomic uncertainty compared to previous years. This bodes well for US.... prospects in 2013. Insurers Generali and Zurich plan to invest in the Spanish bank set up by the country's government to manage toxic property loans, Reuters is reporting. Each of the insurers would invest \u20ac5m in the bad bank. This is a small part of the amount needed, but getting overseas firms involved as shareholders gives the venture further credibility. The jobless picture around Europe gets no better. Portuguese unemployment jumped to a new record of 16.9% in the final quarter of 2012, up from 15.8% in the previous three months. And youth unemployment rose from 39% to 40%. For the whole of last year the jobless rate rose to an average of 15.7% from 12.7% in 2011. Tax hikes and pay cuts, imposed as part of the country's bailout conditions, have not surprisingly hit demand and deepened the recession. Portugal's economy is expected to fall by 1% in 2013 after a 3% fall last year. Prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho said he was worried about the situation (no fooling): This is the most dramatic part of the adjustment process. These figures are worrying. In the US business inventories edged up in December, but less than economists had expected. AP reports: U.S. companies restocked their store shelves and warehouses at a slower pace in December, a sign of caution as sales weakened. Slower restocking was a major drag on the economy in the final three months of last year. The Commerce Department says business inventories ticked up 0.1% in December from November, below the 0.2% pace the previous month and the smallest increase since last June. Analysts had expected an increase in inventories of around 0.3%. Meanwhile, after coming within 140 points of its all time high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped marginally in early trading. More on yesterday's G7 statement about currencies which seemed to cause some confusion. Canada's finance minister Jim Flaherty has said the statement - designed to cool international currency tensions - was not meant to single out Japan. According to Reuters, he said: It was a consensus statement by the members of the G7, the finance ministers and the governors... expressing our concern about exchange rates. Italy sold 30 year bonds successfully today for the first time in two years - the last debt sale before its general election later this month. Investors bought \u20ac888m of debt maturing in 2040 at a yield of 5.07%. Filippo Diodovich from IG Markets said The 30-year bond reopening went very well, with the yield at auction below the 5.12% seen on the secondary market, and a strong bid-to-cover It also sold \u20ac3.45bn-worth of three-year bonds at a yeild of 2.3%, up from 1.85% at the last sale in mid-January, but below December's 2.5%. Just to remind you, three-year bond yields hit 5.3% during the summer before the ECB's pledge to buy bonds to keep yields down. And on that note, I'm handing over the reins to my colleague Nick Fletcher. US retail sale data has shown a mere 0.1% increase in January due to tax increases and higher petrol prices stifling growth. By comparison, there was a 0.5% rise in December. Core sales which exclude cars, petrol and building parts was also up 0.1%, having risen 0.7% in December. Breaking down the numbers, restaurant and bar sales were flat, while sporting goods, hobby and book and music stores rose 0.6%. Electronics were up 0.2% and furniture sales dropped 0.2% Many a joke is being made about horsemeat. Lots of long faces in the Findus boardroom etc. Here's a visual one to keep you amused through lunch as we wait for EU food ministers to chew through the details. The House of Lords EU Committee has written to Greg Clark MP, Financial Secretary to The Treasury, about the threat of complacency from EU leaders. Lord Harrison, Chairman of the Lords EU Sub-Committee on Economic and Financial Affairs, said: The biggest enemy facing the EU today is complacency: complacency that the euro area has turned the corner; complacency that we can take the foot off the pedal of the reforms that are so necessary to break the link between sovereign states and banks now that market pressures have eased; and complacency in the UK. Both the UK Government and the City of London must beware the complacency trap of seeing the euro area\u2019s woes as someone else\u2019s problem. The implications for the UK are immense, not only economically but also in terms of the political ramifications. The future direction of the EU is highly uncertain. In light of the Prime Minister\u2019s recent speech, the UK must ensure that it remains able to shape events rather than be shaped by them. The Committee added it fears Mario Draghi\u2019s commitment to do \u201call that it takes\u201d to save the euro may be masking underlying difficulties facing many euro area countries, and cautioned the effectiveness of the austerity regime, warning successive years of flat-lining growth could be extremely destructive. More reaction on the BoE inflation report. Emmanouil Schizas at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants said: It\u2019s no surprise to hear the Bank of England admit they are going to miss their inflation target for the next three years. The fact that they had previously expected to meet the target by the third quarter of this year is perhaps more noteworthy. Even their updated expectations depend on productivity rebounding, presumably to trend or past average levels. Yet the on-going debate on the UK\u2019s falling productivity is increasingly suggesting that productivity will not rebound \u2013 the UK economy has changed in a structural way and productivity is simply reflecting this. Elsewhere in Brussels, EU ministers are getting ready to meet to discuss the horsemeat scandal. In preparation for the meeting, EU health commissioner Tonio Borg has said all companies that have handled falsely-labelled horsemeat are under suspicion. He said: It is evident that somewhere down the line, someone... has fraudulently or perhaps negligently labelled a product in a deceptive way. All those countries through which this meat product has passed of course are under suspicion. By the countries, I mean the companies in those countries which dealt with this meat product. Key points from BoE inflation report Inflation will remain above 2% target until 2016, three years longer than previously forecast. It will peak at 3.2% this summer GDP is expected to grow in Q1 of 2013 MPC lowers annual growth rate to 1.7% from 2% previously King said: Although output has been broadly flat for the past two years, that masks a more encouraging underlying picture Outside factors, in particular, university tuition fees and utility bills, have added to inflation Answering questions on the EU-US trade agreement, Barroso is asked what he thinks about the horsemeat scandal and where something like regulations around food standards would have in any agreement. He said: Accidents happen in all countries and in all parts of the world. Having said that we have one of the highest protection for consumers and high standards. This matter is going to be discussed with the US, these regulatory matters which have an impact on trade. More analysis on the BoE shortly. Meanwhile, over in Brussels, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, is giving a press conference on the announcement by Barack Obama last night about a trade agreement between the EU and US. He wants to start negotiations in July when Ireland takes presidency of the EU. Barroso said: It provides an assurance for businesses [and shows] the US and EU are strategic partners who are willing to go the extra mile to strengthen their economies. I am confident a joint high level report provides a good framework for the future of negotiations. The commission will move quickly so we can start negotiations as soon as possible. I was glad to see the commitment of all the 27 member states on what will be the biggest bilateral trade agreement ever negotiated. The conference can be watched here And with that, the Bank of England press conference comes to an end (with some rather stirring music on the BoE's website). King rounds off by saying the world needs rebalancing to be sustainable and a shared understanding of that path. He adds: I hope we can achieve that at the G20 meeting in Moscow this week As ever, the Guardian's live coverage of the eurozone crisis will report every cough and splutter from Russia Jason Conibear, trading director at the forex firm Cambridge Mercantile, says Inflation targets, what inflation targets? It takes more than a little chutzpah for a governor of the Bank of England to say that, given that the Bank's primary responsibility is to keep inflation in check. But that is in effect what Sir Mervyn called for in his resolutely pragmatic assessment. He conceded that CPI will continue to rise in the near term, and will stay above the Bank's 2% target for as long as another two years. If there's no chance of the targets being met, many will ask what's the point of having them. Sterling's rapid depreciation against both the Euro and the Dollar since the start of the year has fuelled inflation and further muddied the economic puzzle. Even though both the Bank and the CBI predicted today that the UK economy will return to growth in the current quarter, lingering doubts over the fragility of the recovery will continue to dominate the Bank's monetary policy. So there will be more QE if needed. With the British government set to miss its borrowing targets, the UK's prized AAA credit rating is looking shakier by the day. Market confidence in the Pound was already thin. The Governor's admission that the inflation target is to be quietly ignored while the economy remains in intensive care has stretched it even further. The already wobbly Pound tumbled as a result. King is still going. We're getting close to an hour now. This isn't just a one-off downward shock. This is a shift to a new path for the economy. In the short run we can give support, but it is only temporary. He says policies have to boost aggregate demand which much be in line with ongoing changes which will not return to previous spending habits. King says the government's actions has put up prices which has \"made our job more difficult\". We will have to look through some of those price increases because I think it will be a mistake to let unemployment to go up to offset inflationary pressures. Is Japan acting appropriately in the currency arguments from yesterday's G7? King refuses to comment on individual countries, but stands by the statement from the G7. He says currencies must be allowed to move but economies should be allowed to stimulate growth even if that means exchange rates changing. James Knightley, an economist at ING Bank NV, gives his view on the BoE inflation report. He says The Bank of England inflation report shows the bank is now forecasting inflation above 2% all the way through until the beginning of 2016 versus 3Q 2014 previously. They anticipate inflation will peak at around 3.2% in 3Q 2013, before falling back to target \u201cas a revival in productivity growth dampens increases in domestic costs and external price pressures fade\u201d. Ordinarily, this would be viewed as hawkish signal, but given the BoE only stated last week (and King repeated in today\u2019s press conference) that it \u201cwas appropriate to look through the temporary, albeit protracted, period of above-target inflation\u201d there is little prospect of them doing anything about it. Indeed, Mervyn King has stated that \u201cattempting to bring back inflation to target risks undermining the recovery\u201d. Furthermore, the Bank of England is prepared to \u201cdo more\u201d to support the economy according to King, although we must recognise there are limits to what monetary stimulus can achieve on its own. King again talks about the need for more supply side reforms and efforts to boost overseas demand for exports \u2013 sterling\u2019s recent sharp fall should at least be one reason for optimism here. We would also point out that the BoE\u2019s own credit conditions survey and yesterday\u2019s household interest rate data offered further signs that the Funding for Lending Scheme is starting to offer real support to the economy. As a result, the BoE take the view that the UK economy \u201cis set for a slow but sustained recovery in both demand and effective supply\u201d. The BoE expect a slight rise in 1Q13 GDP with annual GDP growth running at around 1.9% in 2 years\u2019 time. The BoE is firmly in wait and see mode, but there does appear to be a slight easing bias in place. Consequently, any disappointment on the activity front is likely to prompt another round of stimulus even though the BoE acknowledges QE\u2019s limitations. Indeed, if fiscal worries in the US and political concerns in the eurozone dent global sentiment and growth prospects they will likely have to follow up with their conditional promise to \u201cdo more He adds You might be tempted to think that an above-target inflation forecast justifies a tighter monetary policy, and certainly ensuring that inflation returns to target in the medium term is our primary responsibility and objective, but the MPC's remit is to deliver price stability in the medium term in a way that avoids undesirable volatility in output in the short run. The prospect of a further prolonged period of above target inflation must therefore be considered alongside the weakness of the real economy. King says he has been surprised by the impact tuition fee increases and high utility bills has had on inflation. The real question is: Is there a limit to the extent to which any monetary policy can go on to drive private sector demand He adds this is an issue he has spent some time discussing with other MPC members. King says There is cause for optimism. Today too the recovery is in sight. Although output has been broadly flat for the past two years, that masks a more encouraging underlying pciture. The UK economy is therefore set for recovery. That isn't to say that the road ahead will be smooth. Some are looking to the future. King says recovery must be dealt with worldwide and is not a single UK issue. We cannot guarantee a stable path for our economy especially following a banking crisis. It will be harder than 1993 but recover we will. The press conference is now underway. You can watch it on the Bank of England's website here Kings says attempting to bring inflation back to target would risk derailing the economy and below target inflation in the medium term. He says it must be looked at alongside the weak economy Inflation will not return to target until early 2016. Economy is set for a \"slow and sustained recovery\" over the next three years and economic output is unlikely to surpass pre-financial crisis peak until 2015. MPC says it will extend QE if needed CPI inflation will remain around 2.3% over 2 years, up from 1.8% predictions in November. It will remain above 2% until 2016, peaking at 3.2% in Q3 2013 GDP expected to growth in Q1, avoiding another recession Meanwhile, Spanish unemployment may be at 26% while its double-dip recession quickened to an annualised 1.8 % rate of GDP shrinkage in the last quarter of 2012, but Joachim Fels of Morgan Stanley believes the country is on course to rival no less than mighty Germany. Giles Tremlett in Madrid writes: \"Spain, where unit labour costs are falling due to recession and reforms and where exports performance is strong, is on its way to become the euro area\u2019s next Germany,\" Fels says in a note dated February 10. Fels, who is Morgan Stanley's Global Head of Economics, says he has been telling a \"Spain-becomes-Germany-and-Germany-becomes-Spain story\" for a while but, apparently, has had trouble convincing people of his thesis. \"But on my visit to Madrid this past week I felt it resonated for the first time with our Spanish clients. True, the talk and the headlines in Madrid have been dominated by the corruption allegations against the government,\" he wrote. \"However, hardly anybody I met believes that this has the potential to bring down the government or reverse the policy course. Moreover, several of my contacts who were among the most bearish over the last couple of years now think that the worst for the Spanish economy may soon be behind us. I think they are right.\" Eurozone factory output rose for the first time since August, latest figures show. Industrial production was up 0.7%, far better than the 0.2% expected by most economists. The data showed both durable and non-durable consumer goods (from food to fridges) was up 2% in December, compared with a month earlier, and production of machinery to produce other goods was also up 1.3%. Individually, Germany was the biggest riser, up 0.8%, although overall the eurozone was down 2.4% compared with December 2011. As we get ready for the Bank of England press conference, news comes from Canada that governor-elect Mark Carney has revealed he is an Everton fan. Giving evidence to a select committee in Canada he said he supported the team because he has cousins in Liverpool. He added: It\u2019s been more enjoyable being an Edmonton Oilers [a Canadian hockey team] supporter than it has been being an Everton supporter of late, since the Oilers are coming back strong this year. Everton is doing ok. King is an avid Aston Villa fan and when the two teams met 11 days ago it was honours even with the score 3-3. However, Carney can laud it over Sir Merv, because Everton beat Villa 3-1 back in August. Last night, Obama gave his first State of the Union since his election victory last year. In it, he called for a far-reaching free trade agreement with the EU, saying Tonight I am announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union because trade that is free and fair across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs. The US and EU already have little or no tariffs, with stumbling blocks likely to be over restrictions on food and chemicals. Obama's commitment follows similar comments from EU leaders last week. European commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said: The commission will push ahead to realise the full potential of an integrated transatlantic trade agreement. While we would of course encourage all our readers to buy a copy of the Guardian, you may also want to check out the Financial Times, which celebrates its 125th birthday complete with a retro banner this morning. Sir Merv will be warming up his voice as he faces the press in one of his final acts at the governor. The Bank of England press conferences are usually fairly timid affairs, but as it is one of his last, he could want to go out on a high. The two key points expected are a downgrade in GDP estimates while inflation targets are likely to remain unchanged. While some in the City are hoping to see King give his thoughts on his replacement's comments to parliament recently. You can remind yourself of Carney's remarks to the treasury select committee here Paul Donovan at UBS said: G7 politicians were playing with the currency market like it was a puppy. One politician would call \"come here\" to FX dealers, and then five minutes later another politician would call \"no, come here.\" We had better hope they have put plenty of newspaper on the floor. If FX dealers get overexcited, accidents will happen. And now we face the prospect of the G20 at the end of the week. The G20 is like the G7, except that taxpayers' money is wasted from a larger number of countries in flying everyone off for a weekend mini-break. Deputy chairman of the Russian central bank has called for nations not to resort to currency devaluations in a swipe at Japan. Although Alexei Ulyukayev didn't mention Japan by name, he said: We have said more than once that, in a modern, globally interconnected world, one-sided actions are counterproductive. Measures to stimulate domestic demand and boost domestic competitiveness by lowering the exchange rate of the national currency can, of course, give a temporary boost - but no more than temporary. On Friday, Russia hosts two days of G20 talks with finance ministers and central bankers. FTSE 100 opens down 15 points, 0.2%, at 6323 France's Cac opens up 0.1% Germany's Dax opens up 0.2% Spain's Ibex opens up 0.3% Italy's FTSE MIB opens up 0.2% Just to remind you, G7 leaders met yesterday and attempted to allay fears of a currency war after Japan introduced measures to reduce the value of the yen. Our economics editor Larry Elliott has the full story here Fallout continues and is summed up by Michael Hewson at CMC Markets. He says: The G7 didn\u2019t have their finest hour yesterday with a raft of ambiguous announcements that saw currency traders reach for the smelling salts on a day that owed more to keystone cops than anything else. A morning statement that reaffirmed \u201cfiscal and monetary policies have been and will remain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments\u201d, was construed by markets as pretty much giving a green light for Japan to continue its policy to tackle deflationary pressures. This interpretation was soon contradicted by an unnamed G7 official who stated that the G7 is concerned about unilateral guidance on the yen, and that Japan will be in spotlight at G20 meeting in Moscow, and sending the yen sharply higher against the US dollar. A further clarification from a UK treasury official only served to muddy the waters further by stating that the statement was not directed at any country in particular. Good morning and welcome to another day of live coverage of the eurozone crisis and other key economic events from around the world. All eyes will be on Sir Mervyn King at the Bank of England as he faces the press to run through the latest inflation report. Elsewhere, after the currency wars and confusion of yesterday's G7 meeting, world leaders will be taking a break in the build up to Friday's G20 meetings in Russia. We'll bring you predictions in the build up and reaction from yesterday's meeting. Italy dips its toes into the long term bond market again, issuing 30 year bonds. The sale should be a good indicator of investors willingness to buy into an economy on the brink of an important election. We will chew through President Obama's remarks from last night's State of the Union address, in particular, his outlining of a new free trade agreement with the EU. And over in Brussels, EU environment ministers will be meeting to deal with the horsemeat crisis which has seen beef products across the continent contaminated with horses.",

Kate Craig at Liberum Capital issued a sell note, saying: Weak 2012 results [showed] a 9% earnings miss on Liberum numbers (8% miss consensus), 2013 guidance is even worse than expected at 540,000-600,000 ounces per annum versus Liberum [forecast of] 636,000 ounces. We had already brought down our numbers substantially (last year's guidance was 675,000-725,000 ounces, they only achieved 626,000.) Lower down the market Nasstar, a specialist in cloud computing services, rose 2% to 12.75p added another 80 subscribers to its platform, though one of its partners, ihotdesk Limited. Finally Crest Nicholson returned to the stock market five years after the upmarket housebuilder was taken private at the peak of the property cycle, In the biggest flotation so far this year and the largest since Direct Line, the company priced its shares at 220p, the top end of its last indicated range. They closed up 35p at 255p.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The message from the Bank of England was crystal clear: having declined to take action to bring inflation back to its 2% target for the past four years, Threadneedle Street has no intention of changing course now. Policy will remain unchanged, or even become a little looser, even though the Bank estimates it will be 2015 before the annual increase in the cost of living is back on track. In the past, such a forecast would have been enough to prompt a tightening of policy. The Bank's monetary policy committee would have raised interest rates to dampen inflationary pressure. That, though, was during what Sir Mervyn King dubs the Great Stability, the 15-year period between Britain's exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday and the start of the financial crisis in 2007. The past five years have been the story of the Great Recession and its aftermath, with the Bank fearful that any attempt to hit the inflation target would clobber an already enfeebled economy. \"The prospect of a further prolonged period of above-target inflation must therefore be considered alongside the weakness of the real economy,\" King said. \"Attempting to bring inflation back to target sooner would risk derailing the recovery and undershooting the target in the medium term.\" Predictably enough, these comments at King's penultimate inflation report briefing were enough to send sterling lower on the foreign exchanges, but the soon to be departing governor will not mind that one little bit. King believes that the rebalancing of the economy requires the UK to export more, and a cheaper pound will help that. The Bank says increases in tuition fees and domestic energy bills have made it considerably harder to hit the 2% target. The governor said that these costs accounted for only 16% of the basket of goods and services used to calculate the cost of living but were responsible for a percentage point of the current 2.7% inflation rate. In order to hit the official target, price increases for the other 84% of the inflation basket would have to be limited to just one percentage point. That's a tall order, particularly when a lower pound is pushing up the cost of imports. As a result, the Bank is already adopting a \"flexible\" approach to the inflation target favoured by Mark Carney, the governor designate. That's \"flexible\" as in not really trying to hit it. All of which raises a number of intriguing questions. If hitting the inflation target is too difficult to achieve, why not move to a target that is realistic? King opposes this idea, insisting that the Bank is serious about inflation and would respond to any sign of growing domestic inflationary pressure. In the meantime, Threadneedle Street is drawing on the reserves of credibility it built up in the good times. A second question is whether the continued reliance on monetary policy to boost growth is tantamount to pushing on a piece of string? The governor would not quite go that far, but he did admit that the Bank was climbing an ever-steeper hill through its use of rock-bottom interest rates and quantitative easing to stimulate activity. As time passed, \"larger and larger doses of stimulus\" were required, he noted. So, if that's the case, is there an argument for a rebalancing of policy with monetary policy shouldering less of the burden and fiscal policy \u2013 taxes and spending \u2013 having a bigger role? Having strongly supported George Osborne's austerity programme since 2010, King could hardly have been expected to say it was time for a discretionary cut in taxes or less draconian spending cuts and he insisted that monetary policy should be supported by (unspecified) supply-side reforms and by an export drive. This is all well and good, but cannot disguise the fact that the current mix of policy has not worked. In each inflation report, growth is revised down and inflation is revised up. Growth is being stunted by a lack of consumer spending power, a lack of credit for small businesses and poor export prospects. If King is right in his analysis, Osborne is being over-optimistic in his expectation that the new governor can do much more with monetary policy. Instead, the chancellor may need to look at what he can do himself.",

If King is right in his analysis, Osborne is being over-optimistic in his expectation that the new governor can do much more with monetary policy. Instead, the chancellor may need to look at what he can do himself.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's low to middle income families are unlikely to see their living standards return to pre-recession levels for at least another 10 years, the Resolution Foundation thinktank warns . Its report, Squeezed Britain 2013, shows that if low to middle earnings rose by the 1.1% a year above inflation achieved in the past, average annual household incomes in this group would take until 2023 to reach \u00a322,000 \u2013 the equivalent of where they stood in 2008. The Foundation points out that this group's average earnings might now have reached \u00a327,500 but for the downturn since 2008. To reach that level over the next decade would require annual real earnings growth of 3.3%. The foundation says such an increase in earnings is unattainable based on current projections and past experience. It points out that the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's forecaster, predicts average real earnings will continue to fall into 2014 at the same time as support from tax credits and benefits is due to decline. In another extraordinary finding the foundation also says that from 1994-95 to 2009-10 the top 1% of earners accounted for the 15% of the growth in income from employment and investments, while the bottom 50% accounted for another 15%. It says the last year has shown a decline in inequality. The report includes new polling conducted by Ipsos MORI showing voters divided about whether growth will return soon. More than a third (36%) do not believe the economy will be growing again by 2015, while 47% think it will be. Four in 10 people do not expect to be better off in 2015 than today, compared with a similar number (42%) who think they will be. Nearly seven out of 10 people (68%) say they are cutting back on spending. The researchers focused on the so-called squeezed middle \u2013 the country's 10 million adults living on low to middle incomes. Their gross household incomes range from \u00a312,000 to \u00a341,000 depending on how many children the household includes. They do not include the poorest 10% of households and those who receive more than one fifth of their gross household income from means-tested benefits. The Resolution Foundation has long argued that the squeeze on the low to middle income group is not just a result of recent fiscal austerity but is a much longer-term and deeper-seated trend. It says: \"The struggle with stagnant wages, high levels of debt and a heavy reliance on rising tax credits reaches back before the financial crisis and as such it represents a major challenge for all parties. The wages of ordinary full-time workers barely grew in the five years prior to the 2008 crash and were negative for the lowest earners, despite relatively healthy economic growth.\" Even workers in the top half saw their wages grow only slowly. It was only the very richest \u2013 those in the top 5% \u2013 who experienced growth of more than 1% a year. Households in the top 10% of the working-age income distribution accounted for 37% of the overall growth in gross income from employment and investments between 1994-95 and 2010-11, with the top 1% alone taking 13%. In contrast, those in the bottom half accounted for just 17% of overall income growth. The report points to major long-term changes in the housing market. For the first time in recent history the majority of those on low to middle incomes under the age of 35 live in private rented property. The report says under current circumstances it would take 22 years for a household on a low to middle income to save for an average deposit on a first-time home \u2013 in a climate of stagnant incomes and restricted mortgages. The extent to which indebtedness is holding back households, and possibly a return to consumer demand is also underlined. Among all households with debts in the bottom half of the income distribution, 30 per cent are \"debt-loaded\", that is, they spend more than a quarter of their total income on repayments \u2013 even at a time of ultra-low interest rates. Gavin Kelly, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: \"The next election will be about living standards yet little is known about what will be on offer. Given that reductions in tax credits and benefits appear likely after 2015 regardless of the election outcome, it is vital that all parties bring forward ideas for supporting wage growth and helping far more people to work.",
