      "bodyText": "The head of the International Monetary Fund has issued a stark warning that living standards will fall around the world unless governments take urgent action to increase productivity by investing in education, cutting red tape and incentivising research and development. Christine Lagarde used a speech in Washington to tell policymakers they could not simply wait for innovation to drive up productivity growth and help living standards recover from the legacy of the global financial crisis. She highlighted a poor global record on productivity growth in recent years and said IMF analysis suggested GDP in advanced economies would be about 5% higher today if the pre-crisis trend had continued for total factor productivity growth \u2013 a broad measure of what goes into production, such as research spending. \u201cThat would be the equivalent of adding another Japan \u2013 and more \u2013 to the global economy,\u201d the IMF managing director in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute. Legarde warned the world could not afford to leave productivity growth in the doldrums. \u201cAnother decade of weak productivity growth would seriously undermine the rise in global living standards. Slower growth could also jeopardise the financial and social stability of some countries by making it more difficult to reduce excessive inequality and sustain private debt and public obligations. \u201cLeaning back and waiting for artificial intelligence or other technologies to trigger a productivity revival is simply not an option.\u201d Lagarde was speaking as the IMF published new research into the slowdown in productivity, a gauge of economic efficiency that is often measured by the output per hour worked in an economy. That paper highlighted three \u201cheadwinds\u201d holding back productivity growth: ageing populations; a slowdown in global trade; and the \u201cunresolved legacy\u201d of the global financial crisis in some big economies. In the UK, productivity growth has been sluggish for years and is behind most other big economies, prompting the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to pledge more investment in infrastructure and other areas with a \u00a323bn national productivity investment fund. Calling on all governments to do more, Lagarde sought to emphasise productivity as the most important source of higher income and rising living standards. \u201cFor example, the average American worker today works only about 17 weeks to live at the annual real income level of the average worker in 1915,\u201d she said. That kind of progress had been seen in many countries, she added. \u201cBut this engine of prosperity has slowed down in recent years, with negative consequences for growth and incomes that look very hard to unwind.\u201d Lagarde said governments must use investment, education, regulation and incentives for business to ramp up productivity and \u201censure that the next generation will be better off\u201d. She continued: \u201cOne thing is clear: we need more innovation, not less. Market forces alone will not be able to deliver that boost, because innovation and invention are to some degree public goods. \u201cWe at the IMF therefore believe that all governments should do more to unleash entrepreneurial energy. They can achieve this by removing unnecessary barriers to competition, cutting red tape, investing more in education, and providing tax incentives for research and development.\u201d Lagarde did not mention the US president, Donald Trump, by name but she had a clear warning for him and other politicians who have pursued a more protectionist stance on global trade, seemingly to the approval of many voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation. Trade had \u201cserved all economies, not just some to the detriment of others\u201d, Lagarde said. \u201cI firmly believe that reinforcing trade as an engine of broadly shared growth will reduce uncertainty and boost productivity.\u201d The IMF chief urged countries that had received large numbers of refugees to integrate immigrant workers and help create a \u201cyounger and more dynamic workforce, with growth and productivity dividends\u201d. She also echoed concerns over how rapid changes in technology had cost jobs in some sectors, hitting lower skilled workers hardest. Governments must help such workers through targeted education programmes, Lagarde said. That in turn would help solve productivity problems and create more inclusive and sustainable growth. \u201cAbove all, we need more and better education,\u201d she said. \u201cEducation and training are the key policy actions to raise both productivity growth and reduce inequality.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is to shrink the size of hundreds of its branches so they have only two staff with tablet computers helping customers. The new \u201cmicro branches\u201d will not have counters, with customers paying in cash and cheques through self-service machines and talking to mortgage advisers through video links. Alongside the micro branches it will open 20 larger banks in city centres, offering a wider ranger of services, and introduce 20 new mobile branches operating out of vans. \u201cBranches are a vital part of our strategy, and we\u2019re investing in our network to make sure it\u2019s right for the future. We\u2019re transforming branches, responding to customers and giving them choice, including new flagship branches in city centre locations, and introducing some smaller micro-formats alongside our community and mobile branches,\u201d a Lloyds spokeswoman said. The new micro branch format is based on a pilot at an existing branch near St Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London. Banks are closing branches across the country due to the rise of online banking. Lloyds \u2013 which owns Bank of Scotland and Halifax \u2013 has already announced plans to close 400 of its branches, with more than 9,000 job losses, while last month Royal Bank of Scotland said it was shutting 158 sites, mostly NatWest\u2019s, and the Co-operative Bank is battling to find a buyer amid fears about its future. In January, HSBC said it was shutting a further 62 branches this year, on top of 55 already earmarked for closure, while Yorkshire Building Society revealed it was closing 48 branches, 28 of which are Norwich &amp; Peterborough outlets. Susan Kramer, the Treasury spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: \u201cLloyds and other banks are turning their backs on the communities that have been the foundation of its business for generations.\u201d The downsizing of Lloyds branches was revealed as the government cut its stake in Lloyds to below 2%. UK Financial Investments, which manages the stake in Lloyds, sold off about 1% of the shares in the bank. This left it with a stake of 1.97% and edges the bank another step closer to full private ownership. The sale means more than \u00a320bn has now been returned to government coffers since the lender\u2019s \u00a320.3bn bailout at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. This includes about \u00a3500m in payouts to shareholders since the bank resumed paying dividends in 2014 as it has returned to profit growth in recent years. The stake sale is the latest in a series by the government, which said in October that it hoped to offload its remaining shares in Lloyds within a year. The City expects Lloyds to return to full private ownership by June. Simon Kirby, the economic secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cI welcome this further progress in returning Lloyds to the private sector. We have now recovered over \u00a320bn for the taxpayer and are very close to recovering all of the money taxpayers injected into the bank during the financial crisis.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BP\u2019s \u00a3200m sale of a major North Sea oil pipeline to petrochemicals company Ineos should face scrutiny by MPs, the Unite union has said, claiming the deal poses a risk to jobs and puts key infrastructure in the hands of one man. Ineos said it had agreed with BP to buy the Forties Pipeline System, which transports nearly 40% of the oil produced in the North Sea and employs 300 people. The sale gives its billionaire founder-owner Jim Ratcliffe control of a 100-mile system of pipelines, as well as the Kinneil terminal, which processes oil and gas for Ineos\u2019s vast Grangemouth refinery. Ratcliffe said the deal would secure jobs in the long term but Unite, which has previously fought acrimonious battles with Ineos, called for MPs in Westminster and Holyrood to look into the deal. Unite\u2019s Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, pointed out that both Grangemouth and the pipeline system had once been owned by a nationalised British Petroleum \u201cwith a responsibility to look at what was good for the country as a whole, not just what was good for a small group of wealthy individuals\u201d. \u201cBoth these parts of vital national infrastructure, which are central to the success of the Scottish and wider UK economy, are now essentially in the hands of one man,\u201d he said. \u201cUnite firmly believes that this sale is bad for Scotland and the UK.\u201d \u201cWe demand that both the Scottish and Westminster parliament carry out inquiries and that every MSP and MP in Scotland has a responsibility to make their position clear.\u201d \u201cDo they believe this sale is in the national interest?\u201d Unite added that it had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the livelihoods, pensions and employment conditions of 300 people employed by BP on the Forties Pipeline System. The union had previously fought a bitter battle with Ratcliffe, afterIneos threatened to close the huge Grangemouth refinery altogether in 2013 during a bad-tempered cost-cutting dispute. Ratcliffe said the Forties Pipeline System deal would work out in the best interests of the oil and gas industry and the regional economy. \u201cWe have a strong track record of acquiring non-core assets and improving their efficiency and reliability, securing long term employment and investment,\u201d he said. \u201cI am delighted that we can now bring this integrated system back under single ownership in Ineos.\u201d The deal will still need the approval of the independent Oil and Gas Authority, which has to be satisfied that it will not conflict with the aim of extracting as much of the remaining North Sea oil as possible.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s official, America\u2019s manufacturing sector slowed last month. The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) just released its own report, and like Markit\u2019s rival data it shows that the growth rate dipped. The ISM\u2019s manufacturing PMI fell to 57.2 in March, down from 57.7 in February. That\u2019s still a decent-enough result, comfortably over the 50-point mark that divides rising and falling activity level, and a little higher than expected. Here are the key points, via Bloomberg: ISM\u2019s production gauge cooled to a four-month low of 57.6 from 62.9, which was the best reading since March 2011 Gauge of supplier deliveries rose to 55.9 in March, the highest since December 2014, from 54.8 Measure of order backlogs climbed to 57.5, the best reading in three years, from 57 Customer inventories gauge fell to 47, matching the second-lowest since July 2015, from 47.5 That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The first of two healthchecks on America\u2019s factory sector just arrived, and it\u2019s a little disappointing. Markit\u2019s monthly US manufacturing PMI has fallen by nearly one whole point, from 54.2 to 53.3. That\u2019s the lowest reading since September 2016, signalling that growth has hit a six-month low. US manufacturers reported that new orders and output growth had slowed, meaning they also hired fewer new staff than earlier this year. And again, there are signs that raw materials are getting more expensive... Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief business economist, is warning that the US economy may be weakening: \u201cThe post-election resurgence of the manufacturing sector seen late last year is showing signs of losing steam. Output growth slowed to a six-month low in March, optimism about the outlook has waned and hiring has slowed accordingly. \u201cWhile the survey data suggest that the goods producing sector enjoyed a relatively good first quarter on the whole, the loss of momentum seen in February and March bodes ill for the second quarter. Newsflash: Another UK company is facing a takeover offer from an overseas rival. This time it\u2019s WS Atkins, the engineering, design, planning, and architectural design firm based in Epsom, Surrey. It has received a takeover offer from SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., a Montreal-based engineering services company. The approach values Atkins at \u00a320.80 per share, a 35% premium to Friday night\u2019s close. Atkins told the City that: The Board of Atkins has indicated to SNC-Lavalin that the Possible Offer would deliver value to Atkins shareholders at a level that the Board would be prepared to recommend, subject to reaching agreement on the other terms and conditions of the offer. Atkins and SNC-Lavalin are in discussions about the other terms and conditions of the Possible Offer which is conditional on, amongst other things, diligence and financing. Shares in Atkins have soared by almost 30% to \u00a319.95, suggesting that City expects the deal to sail through. It\u2019s been a rather subdued morning in the City, with sentiment dampened by the slowdown in UK factory output growth. The FTSE 100 never really got moving, and is currently up just 1 points (0.02%). Joshua Mahony, market analyst at online trading firm IG, says investors are edgy as they wait for the leaders of America and China to meet later this week. Market direction remains indecisive, given the huge number of economic and political issues at hand.... The FTSE has started the week in somewhat indecisive fashion, with initial gains promptly erased ahead of a big week for the markets. Fashion firm Burberry is outperforming the market, up 1% after signing a deal to license its fragrances and cosmetics brands to US beauty firm Coty. The pound has lost half a eurocent against the euro today to \u20ac1.173, as well as half a cent against the US dollar. Paresh Davdra, CEO of RationalFX, explains why: \u201cAfter sustaining an upward trend last week, the pound has fallen as the release of UK manufacturing figures showed signs of a slowdown. For the first time in several days, the pound showed signs of weakness against the euro and the dollar on the back of disappointing manufacturing figures for March \u2013 in marked contrast to the robust figures seen in Eurozone. These weaker figures suggest that after months of good export levels, the inflationary effects of Brexit and the falling demand for consumer goods could be making it difficult to sustain the same levels of growth. Today\u2019s PMI report also shows that UK firms are having to cope with sharply rising input costs - as raw materials become steadily pricier. That\u2019s partly due to the depreciation in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, explains that firms are now passing those costs on. The reduced buying power of the Pound has led to the 11th consecutive rise in input costs with consumers feeling the effects in the form of higher prices on the high street. There are also signs that supply chains are struggling, with companies reporting longer waits for their own orders to be delivered. Brocks comments: Supplier delivery times have also begun to lag, clogging up the supply chains of British manufacturing. With the rate of new order growth showing early signs of easing in March, manufacturers must act to ensure they are not locked into costly contracts. Now is not the time for manufacturers to rest on their laurels. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says the French presidential elections will determine whether Europe\u2019s recent recovery continues: \u201cEurope\u2019s economic growth looks to be robust with factory output growth hitting the fastest rate since April 2011. Germany and Netherlands within the euro-core continued to show strong growth but Greece deteriorated further during March. The surprising element has been UK\u2019s manufacturing, which has indicated a slowdown despite boost of the weaker pound after Brexit. As we now enter the second quarter of the year, the key event in Europe will be the French presidential election. While Eurosceptic Marine le Pen is expected to win in the first round and lose in the second round run-off , it is worth remembering opinion polls have proved fallible in predicting the strength of populist sentiment in the case of Brexit and the Trump victory. A Le Pen victory would be huge challenge for the ECB as it would be required to give massive support to the Euro and to French bonds and banks as they would come under severe market pressure.\u201d Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal points out that the eurozone jobless rate is now below its average level, thanks to today\u2019s fall: Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight reckons Europe\u2019s labour market is benefiting from \u201crecent solid Eurozone growth and healthy business confidence\u201d. However.... With still appreciable slack in labour markets in most Eurozone countries, wage growth looks most likely to pick up only gradually. It\u2019s a record-breaking day in India, where the stock market has closed at its highest ever level. Traders were encouraged by today\u2019s manufacturing data, which showing growth picking up. Marianne Thyssen, the European Commissioner for Employment, tweets that European leaders need to keep pushing to bring unemployment down: We have further good news for the Eurozone this morning, on top of the strong factory data. Unemployment across the region has fallen to its lowest level in almost eight years, in another sign that its economic recovery continues. The eurozone jobless rate fell to 9.5% in February, statistics body Eurostat reports, down from 9.6% in January. That\u2019s the lowest rate recorded in the euro area since May 2009. Unemployment in the wider European Union also fell in February, to 8.0% from 8.1%. Twenty six EU members reported lower unemployment than a year ago, but the jobless rate did rise in Denmark and Lithuania. However, the figures also highlights the sharp differences across Europe. The lowest jobless rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (3.4%), Germany (3.9%) and Malta (4.1%). But in Greece, the jobless rate remains over 23%, and in Spain it is 18.0% (They mean February 2017, of course) Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, isn\u2019t too concerned by the slowdown in UK factory growth last month. \u201cAlthough March saw an easing in output, manufacturing\u2019s solid start to the year continues with healthy order books and exporters continuing to capitalise on sterling\u2019s weakness. However, with inflation looming large, manufacturers should be increasingly conscious of the potential softening of UK domestic demand, which has been fuelling growth for some time.\u201d Apologies, we\u2019re having some technical problems with images this morning. It\u2019s being looked into; in the meantime, here\u2019s the UK manufacturing PMI (in case you can\u2019t see it in the 9.42pm post) The pound has been hit by the news that UK factory growth slowed last month. Sterling is down almost half a cent against the US dollar this morning, at $1.2498. Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, suspects that UK factories will suffer from slowing consumer demand this year: \u201cToday\u2019s data certainly doesn\u2019t set off any alarm bells but it does signal that the consumer, one of the big props of UK growth in recent years, is already under the cosh and if there is any loss of momentum in the global economy, these strong manufacturing indicators could falter.\u201d Newsflash! Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector slowed in March, dashing hopes that growth would pick up. The UK manufacturing PMI has fallen to 54.2, the lowest reading in four months, according to data firm Markit. That\u2019s down from 54.5 in February, and rather weaker than the 55.0 which some City forecasters had expected. [reminder: Any reading over 50 shows growth] Markit reports that output and new order growth both slowed last month, suggesting that the British economy may be cooling. Consumer goods producers suffered the sharpest slowdown, with growth little higher than in February. Firms also reported another rise in input costs, as inflationary pressures hit the sector again. More encouragingly, they did also keep hiring staff. Rob Dobson, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, says Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector seems to be slowing down: \u201cThe survey data suggest that the goods-producing sector made a solid contribution to GDP during the opening quarter of 2017. However, it\u2019s clear that the expansion will be less than the buoyant 1.3% rise seen in the fourth quarter of last year. \u201cWith growth losing further momentum in March, that weaker trend is likely to continue into the second quarter. The latest survey also clearly shows that high costs and weak wage growth are sapping the strength of consumers, with rates of expansion in output and new orders for these products slowing further. Markit has also warned that Greece\u2019s manufacturing downturn continued last month: Operating conditions in the Greek manufacturing sector deteriorated further during March. The downturn was driven by another sharp decrease in new orders, which in turn contributed to a further drop in output. As a result of lower production requirements, firms reduced their staffing numbers and input buying. Boom! Europe\u2019s economic recovery continued last month, with factory growth hitting its fastest rate since April 2011. Data firm Markit reports that growth rates for production and new orders accelerated to near six-year highs in March. Companies reported a surge of orders from domestic and export clients, leading to faster job creation. This drove the overall eurozone manufacturing PMI up to 56.2 in March, up from 55.4 in February, showing the fastest growth in 71 months. The pace of the recovery is now causing new problems, with some firms reporting that their suppliers are struggling to meet demand. Germany and the Netherlands led the way with particularly robust growth. But Greece missed out again, suffering another contraction. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cEurozone manufacturing is clearly enjoying a sweet spell as we move into spring, but it is also suffering growing pains in the form of supply delays and rising costs. \u201cAll key business activity gauges \u2013 output, new order inflows, exports, backlogs of work and employment \u2013 are close to six-year highs. \u201cHowever, the survey is also signalling the highest incidence of supplier delivery delays for nearly six years, underscoring how suppliers are struggling to meet surging demand. \u201cThese delays send a warning signal about rising inflationary pressures, as busy suppliers are often able to hike prices. Prices charged for goods leaving the factory gate are consequently rising at the fastest rate since mid-2011, despite March seeing a drop in the price of oil and a stronger euro against the US dollar, as supplier price hikes are passed on to customers. \u201cThe upturn is broad-based with one exception. Greece is suffering an increased rate of contraction of its manufacturing economy, with exports dropping sharply again in March.\u201d German factory growth has hit its highest level in almost six years, thanks to a rise in exports. Markit says: Output increased at the fastest rate in over three years, driven by the strongest gain in new orders in nearly six years. Moreover, new export orders grew at the strongest pace since May 2010. This led to the sharpest rise in employment in over five-and-a-half years. France\u2019s manufacturing sector also had a good March, today\u2019s data shows. New orders surged, sending the French factory PMI up to 53.3 from 52.3 in February. Good news from Italy! The country\u2019s manufacturing sector has posted its fastest jump in activity since March 2011. Italian factory bosses reported a \u201csharp and accelerated growth\u201d last month, with production rates picking up, new orders rising, and higher exports too. Data firm Markit also found that job creation accelerated, saying A record rise in backlogs of work meanwhile contributed to a further pick-up in factory job creation, while goods producers also raised their input buying levels. Encouragingly, manufacturers also showed plenty of optimism towards growth prospects in the coming year too. The first eurozone manufacturing data has arrived..... and it shows that Spain\u2019s factory sector slowed last month. The Spanish manufacturing PMI fell to 53.9 in March, the lowest reading since October, down from 54.8 in February. That\u2019s still comfortably over the 50-point that separates expansion from contraction, though, and firms said they were still optimistic about future prospects. Sanish firms also reported that the cost of raw materials continued to climb. Markit, which compiles the report, says: The rate of input cost inflation quickened to the fastest in nearly six years during March, having accelerated for the seventh month running. Among the items reported as being up in price were cotton, paper, plastics, steel, fuel and other oil-related products. Wowzers. Shares in UK chip designer Imagination Technologies have plunged by over 60% this morning, after it shocked the City by revealing that Apple will no longer use its intellectual property in its new products. Apple are Imagination\u2019s largest customer, and provide around half its revenue by using its intellectual property in iPhones, iPads, and iPods under a licensing agreement. All that will change in two years, though, Imagination revealed this morning in a rather terse announcement. Imagination also hinted at legal battles ahead, claiming it will be \u201cextremely challenging\u201d for Apple to design new chip architecture without infringing its intellectual property rights..... Germany\u2019s stock market is heading to a fresh record high in early trading, as Frankfurt traders start the week in good form. The DAX is leading Europe\u2019s stock markets higher in early trading, and has jumped over its previous record close in 2015. There\u2019s a more muted feeling in London where the FTSE 100 is pretty flat. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: April hits the ground running this Monday, with the markets kicking off the second quarter with a glimpse at Q1\u2019s final manufacturing PMIs. Turkey\u2019s manufacturing sector has posted its fastest growth in three years. Today\u2019s Purchasing Managers Index report shows that firms took on more staff last month, to handle a pick-up in new orders. We\u2019ve already seen some encouraging manufacturing reports from Asia today, including a strong pick-up in India and steady growth in Japan. Reuters has the details: Factories across much of Asia posted another month of solid growth in March, rounding off a strong quarter for the world\u2019s manufacturers, even as exporters fear a rise in U.S. protectionism could snuff out a global trade recovery. China again led the way, with an official manufacturing index expanding at the fastest pace in nearly five years, while factory surveys on Monday showed encouraging growth as well in Japan, India and much of emerging Asia. Higher commodities prices have helped boost the value of exports, along with a global thirst for electronic gadgets, but many countries are reporting stronger sales volumes as well, even as the new Trump administration starts to flex its muscles on trade. \u201cAsia\u2019s economic backdrop remains solid with most countries remaining above the key threshold level of expansion, though U.S. trade protectionism fears is the biggest uncertainty for now,\u201d said Aidan Yao, an economist at AXA Investment Managers in Hong Kong. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a new month, which means a new flurry of reports on the world\u2019s manufacturing sector. At 9.30am we find out how Britain\u2019s factories fared in March. Economists predict another month of solid activity, with the weak pound providing a cushion to Brexit uncertainty. The consensus is that the UK manufacturing PMI will rise to around 55.1, up from 54.6 in February. That would signal faster growth, and a pretty strong start to 2017. Before that, we get figures from across the eurozone. And again, economists expect some decent figures, which would indicate that Europe\u2019s recovery is continuing to pick up. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has rounded up the predictions: We get to see the latest numbers from Spain, Italy, France and Germany, all four of which have shown a steady improvement since the beginning of the year, and which are expected to come in at 54.6, 55.2, 53.4 and 58.3 respectively, helped in no small part by the weaker euro. Any reading over 50 points shows growth, so these reports could drive Germany\u2019s stock market to a new record high: Then at 10am, we get the latest eurozone unemployment figures. Economists reckon the jobless rate could fall to 9.5% in February, which would be its lowest since 2009! Investors will also be thinking about geopolitics, where the situation looks rather tense. Donald Trump will be entertaining Chinese leader Xi-Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago golf course in Florida later this week, and there could be fireworks if the president brings up issues like currency manipulation and globalisation. And then there\u2019s Brexit, where the UK government is now vigorously defending Gibraltar\u2019s sovereignty. Four days after Article 50 was triggered, the first comparisons with the Falklands Islands have begun....",

      "bodyText": "Shares in the UK chip designer Imagination Technologies have slumped 70% after it said Apple, its largest customer, would stop using its graphics technology in the iPhone and other new products by 2019. The move is a major blow to the British company, which designs the graphics processors used in smartphones and other electronic devices and relies on Apple for half its revenues. The firm warned that the US tech firm risked infringing its intellectual property rights. Apple has used Imagination\u2019s chip technology under a licensing agreement for many years and is one of its biggest shareholders, with an 8.2% stake. It came close to buying the firm, which is based in Herfordshire, near London, a year ago. Imagination\u2019s technology has formed the basis of graphics processor units (GPU) in iPhones, iPads, iPods, TVs and watches. But Apple has been working on a separate, independent graphics design to control its products and has served notice it will stop using Imagination\u2019s technology in its new products within 15 months to two years. Imagination has begun talks with Apple as it gears up for a battle over its intellectual property rights. It said they were discussing potential alternative commercial arrangements for the current licence and royalty agreement. The chip designer said: \u201cApple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination\u2019s technology, without violating Imagination\u2019s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. \u201cImagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple\u2019s assertions.\u201d Imagination received \u00a360.7m in licence fees and royalties from Apple last year, which is expected to rise to \u00a365m in the year to 30 April. The struggling firm has been slashing costs, including the cutting of 350 jobs, and restructuring its business after a series of profit warnings. It offloaded its digital radio business Pure last September. The cost cutting and a foreign exchange boost helped return Imagination to profit in the first half following its worst annual loss the previous year. It posted an operating profit from continuing operations of \u00a32.9m for the six months to October. Just over half of Imagination\u2019s 1,200 workforce are based in the UK, with the rest working in Europe, US, China and India. Its head office and main R&amp;D centre are in Kings Langley near London. The business is run by Andrew Heath, a former Rolls-Royce executive, who took over from long-serving chief executive Sir Hossein Yassaie in February 2016, initially on an interim basis. Oliver Knott, analyst at N+1 Singer, cut his recommendation on the shares to a \u201csell\u201d, saying: \u201cIf the group is unsuccessful in challenging Apple\u2019s position, we would expect the group to need to make significant operational changes to align the cost base to the new revenue profile..\u201d Imagination shares plummeted more than 70% to 76p in early trading on Monday \u2013 their lowest level since 2009 and about a tenth of their record of 734p hit in 2012. They were still down more than 60% at 97.6p by lunchtime, giving the firm a market value of \u00a3275m \u2013 compared with more than \u00a32bn in April 2012. Steve Clayton, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe market has been spooked by the real chance that Imagination could soon swing into substantial losses if Apple do indeed sever their ties. \u201cImagination\u2019s financial track record has been unpredictable over the years even before this. Last year, exceptional restructuring costs pushed them deep into the red and the hope was that they were now on the road to recovery. Their problems now are a great example of the risks in having too many eggs in one basket.\u201d Russ Mould, investment director at the investment platform AJ Bell, said: \u201cThis is a juddering setback for Imagination, whose shares had begun to run strongly under chief executive Andrew Heath. Today\u2019s plunge takes Imagination back to levels last seen in 2009 and leaves the shares way adrift of 2012\u2019s peak north of 700p \u2013 a mark they had even failed to reach during the technology, media and telecoms bubble of 1998-2000.\u201d The company, founded in 1985 as VideoLogic, floated on the stock market in 1994. It has struggled with a slowdown in the smartphone market and increased competition from UK rival ARM and others. It is trying to grab a bigger share of the mid-tier smartphone market, such as phones made by Chinese manufacturers.",

    "webTitle": "Co-operative Group to write off the value of its stake in Co-op bank", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group will reveal this week it has fallen back into the red for the first time since its tumultuous 2013 year, after writing off the value of its investment in the Co-operative Bank. The mutual is set to take a \u00a3140m hit as it slashes the value of its 20% stake in the bank to zero, amid ongoing uncertainty about its former financial arm\u2019s future. The Co-op Bank, which is now controlled by US hedge funds after a 2013 rescue deal, put itself up for sale in February in a bid to raise more capital and give greater stability to its 4 million customers. The Co-operative Group, which now focuses on its grocery chain, funeral homes and insurance services, was forced to relinquish the majority of its stake in the bank after it emerged it required \u00a31.5bn in the wake of a disastrous takeover of the Britannia building society. The financial woes were compounded by revelations that the bank\u2019s former chairman, Paul Flowers, took class A drugs. This led to thousands of customers leaving the scandal-hit firm. The mutual is currently considering a sale of its remaining stake as part of the current talks and it\u2019s not clear if the bank\u2019s brand will survive. The group has written down the value of its stake in Co-op bank twice in the past year, taking it to \u00a3140m in September, well below the \u00a3333m it pumped into the troubled operation nearly four years ago to keep it afloat. The latest writedown will mean the Co-operative Group will report a statutory loss for the year to the end of December 2016 on Thursday, its worst performance since reporting a \u00a3277m loss in 2013. In 2015 the group achieved a \u00a323m profit down from a \u00a3124m a year before. But the underlying performance of the Co-op, excluding the bank, is going well, according to insiders. The group has modernised its stores and food ranges and benefited from a move towards shopping in small local grocery shops in recent years. While discount rival Aldi overtook the Co-op to become the UK\u2019s fifth-largest grocer in February, the Co-op has increased sales ahead of most other rivals helping it maintain a 6% market share. However, in September, the Co-op revealed that pre-tax profits more than halved to \u00a317m in the first six months of 2016 after restructuring costs and price cuts. The company insisted that its three-year turnaround plan was on track. Richard Pennycook, who stepped in as chief executive to lead a turnaround plan, left the business last month after handing over to Steve Murrells but remains on the payroll as an adviser. Sources said the writedown of the Co-op bank did not mean the bank was worthless, but was a mark of the uncertainty of its future. An update on the sale process is expected by mid-April, but could come as early as this week. It has been reported that the bank has plunged in value to as little as \u00a345m. Late last month, the troubled bank said a number of \u201ccredible\u201d potential buyers have expressed an interest. Virgin Money and CYBG, the owner of the Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank networks, are thought to be set to put forward bid proposals, but fears are growing that the Co-op bank will be broken up rather than sold as an entity. It has emerged that the Bank of England has placed Co-op bank under \u201cintensive supervision\u201d with contingency plans to ensure an \u201corderly failure\u201d if a sale or an injection of fresh capital is not agreed. The 150-year old, ethically-minded bank failed a Bank stress test in 2014, and recently reported a \u00a3477m full-year loss. The Co-op bank\u2019s huge pension liabilities are among the major obstacles to a sale. The mutual has 2 million members who are Co-op bank customers. When the bank put itself up for sale in February, the mutual said: \u201cOur goal is to ensure the continued provision of the type of co-operative banking products our members want.\u201d In February, the Co-operative Group\u2019s chairman Allan Leighton said the group was open-minded about the future of the bank stake and did not rule out being part of a plan to inject more capital into the beleaguered lender.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lycamobile, the international phone call business and a major donor to the Conservative party, is embroiled in a \u00a326m tax dispute with HMRC over VAT. Accounts filed with Companies House show that Lycamobile\u2019s UK division nearly doubled its pre-tax profits to \u00a310.9m last year on turnover of \u00a3194m. But the company, owned by Sri Lankan-born tycoon Allirajah Subaskaran, also revealed that it could face a bill of \u00a326m from HMRC, including \u201cpotential penalties\u201d, due to a dispute over VAT. Lycamobile said the charge related to \u201ccertain VAT positions that have been taken by the company between 1 July 2012 and 29 February 2016\u201d. \u201cThe position is currently subject to dispute between HMRC and the company,\u201d it said. Auditors from KPMG have revealed that they are unable to form an opinion on the accounts due to a lack of \u201csufficient appropriate audit evidence\u201d. Last year, the accounting firm flagged up its confusion over \u00a3134m in funds owed to Lycamobile UK by related companies, adding that the knock-on effect on this year\u2019s accounts meant it was still lacking information. \u201cBecause of the significance of the matter [...] we have not been able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for an audit opinion,\u201d said KPMG. \u201cAccordingly we do not express an opinion on the financial statements.\u201d It added: \u201cWe were unable to determine if adequate accounting records have been kept by the parent company.\u201d Lycamobile UK\u2019s own directors\u2019 report admitted that the tax dispute and complex structure create \u201cmaterial uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\u201d. The Labour party and tax experts said the accounts raised questions for the Conservative party, which accepted \u00a3614,300 from Lycamobile in 2016 and nearly \u00a31m the year before. Tax accountant Richard Murphy said KPMG\u2019s audit report and the VAT dispute raised \u201cmassive uncertainty\u201d about Lycamobile\u2019s financial position. He said: \u201cIn the circumstances anyone dealing with the company has been given notice as to the risk they take. And the Conservative party is especially vulnerable. Taking donations from a company subject to this level of doubt as to its true financial position looks unwise. They\u2019d do themselves a favour by saying no to further offers for the time being.\u201d Lycamobile\u2019s accounts also revealed that it paid \u00a372m to another part of Subaskaran\u2019s business network, based in the low tax jurisdiction of Madeira, which the company said was for phone airtime. A spokesperson said it had \u201cno impact whatsoever on affecting the tax charge for Lycamobile UK\u201d. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, raised concerns about the VAT dispute and the reasons for Lycamobile\u2019s transactions through a Madeira company. \u201cIf true, then it\u2019s time for the Tories to get a grip and take tax avoidance seriously for once and refuse further donations from any company that funnels money via a tax haven,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the Tories are not handing out \u00a370bn in tax giveaways to big business and the super-rich they are blocking action to clamp down on tax avoidance, threatening to turn Britain into a tax haven and taking donations from companies that have questions raised over their tax arrangements. \u201cIf Philip Hammond and Theresa May want to be taken seriously on tax avoidance and party funding, then they need to get their house in order. \u201cThey could start by simply committing to not take donations from such companies, publishing their tax returns in full, and taking on board Labour\u2019s recommendations for more tax transparency. Otherwise the public will continue to not take them seriously on this matter.\u201d A Conservative spokesman said: \u201cAll donations to the Conservative party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with rules.\u201d Lycamobile gave nearly \u00a31m to the Conservatives in 2015, while Subaskaran has previously been a guest at the Tories\u2019 \u201cblack and white\u201d election fundraiser at Grosvenor House hotel in Mayfair, an event for which guests paid up to \u00a315,000 a table. His company\u2019s support of the Conservative party has previously come under scrutiny after it emerged in 2012 that it had paid no corporation tax for three years.",

They\u2019d do themselves a favour by saying no to further offers for the time being.\u201d</p> <p>Lycamobile\u2019s accounts also revealed that it paid \u00a372m to another part of Subaskaran\u2019s business network, based in the low tax jurisdiction of Madeira, which the company said was for phone airtime.</p> <p>A spokesperson said it had \u201cno impact whatsoever on affecting the tax charge for Lycamobile UK\u201d.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, raised concerns about the VAT dispute and the reasons for Lycamobile\u2019s transactions through a Madeira company.</p> <p>\u201cIf true, then it\u2019s time for the Tories to get a grip and take tax avoidance seriously for once and refuse further donations from any company that funnels money via a tax haven,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p> \u201cWhen the Tories are not handing out \u00a370bn in tax giveaways to big business and the super-rich they are blocking action to clamp down on tax avoidance, threatening to turn Britain into a tax haven and taking donations from companies that have questions raised over their tax arrangements.</p> <p> \u201cIf Philip Hammond and Theresa May want to be taken seriously on tax avoidance and party funding, then they need to get their house in order. </p> <p>\u201cThey could start by simply committing to not take donations from such companies, publishing their tax returns in full, and taking on board Labour\u2019s recommendations for more tax transparency. Otherwise the public will continue to not take them seriously on this matter.\u201d</p> <p>A Conservative spokesman said: \u201cAll donations to the Conservative party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with rules.\u201d</p> <p>Lycamobile gave nearly \u00a31m to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservatives</a> in 2015, while Subaskaran has previously been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/15/tory-conservative-party-donor-funding\">guest at the Tories\u2019 \u201cblack and white\u201d election fundraiser</a> at Grosvenor House hotel in Mayfair, an event for which guests paid up to \u00a315,000 a table.</p> <p>His company\u2019s support of the Conservative party has previously come under scrutiny after it emerged in 2012 that it had paid no corporation tax for three years.</p> <p></p>",
