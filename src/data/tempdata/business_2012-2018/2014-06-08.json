      "body": "<p>All political parties love a good catchphrase, and the government\u2019s favourite at the moment relates to debt. </p> <p>Ministers from Tony Abbott down love to note that we are paying \u201ca billion dollars a month\u201d in interest on our debt, and that they inherited a \u201crecord\u201d amount of debt.</p> <p>So let\u2019s give those claims a bit of a look.<br></p> <p>First, we have to remember that government spending, revenue and debt can always be related in a few ways. </p> <p>The dopiest way is to use nominal terms. This is the way that ignores inflation and increases in population. As I noted when looking at the budget expenditure, it\u2019s the best way to go if you want to show that you are spending more than you did last year.</p> <p>It\u2019s pretty stupid and should be used only by people who think that a house that sold for $200,000 in 1985 would sell for the same amount now.</p> <p>But debt is also tricky because we can look at total debt and also look at interest payments; and we can also look at total debt in both gross and net terms.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with total debt. I\u2019ll mostly use net terms because talking in gross terms sounds good, but it\u2019s like talking about how much you spend each month without considering how much you earn.</p> <p>There is no doubt that if we use nominal terms government net debt is at a record level. The recent budget papers have it at $226.4bn, absolutely miles above the $96bn the Howard government inherited in 1996.<br></p> <p>But, really, let\u2019s not be stupid and use nominal terms; we\u2019re a bit smarter than that, surely?<br></p> <p>The problem with looking at government expenditure in real terms (i.e. adjusted for inflation) is that it doesn\u2019t make much sense either over the long term. </p> <p>This is because our economy grows faster than inflation. And a good thing too, otherwise real GDP growth would be zero. It grows faster than inflation because not only do we get more productive, our population grows as well.</p> <p>In 1985, Australia\u2019s population was about 15.8m; now it is 23.5m. So even without inflation it\u2019s not surprising that a government would spend (and tax) more now than it did then.</p> <p>But prices do also rise \u2013 in the past 20 years inflation has grown 69% while our GDP has increased about 240%.</p> <p>So the best way to look at government expenditure, revenue or, in this case, debt over time is to look at it as a proportion of GDP. And on this score the level of net debt of 12.5% of GDP is well below the record level of 18.1% reached in 1995-96: (Use the drop down to see differences.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/SzLxy/\" frameborder=\"0\"allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\"oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\"width=\"480\"height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But I also think looking at debt as a proportion of GDP can be a bit misleading \u2013 after all, the government\u2019s income is not the entire GDP of Australia. So I have also measured debt as a proportion of government revenue. On this measure, the 2013-14 level is about 54%, again well below the record level of 77% in 1995-96.</p> <p>The good thing about looking at debt as a percentage of GDP or government revenue is it enables us to compare Australia with other nations (note in the graph I have not included Norway because its sovereign wealth funds rather skew the scale of the graph \u2013 its net debt is minus 201% of GDP):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/IgdbY/\" frameborder=\"0\"allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\"oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption> <br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>And, yes, while our debt is low compared with others, I hear you say, what about our growth of debt?

      "bodyText": "Genetically modified food, data privacy and surveillance techniques are among the new screening tests the Co-operative Bank is considering adding to its ethical policy, under which it has turned away \u00a31.2bn of business in the past 20 years. The bank's chief, Niall Booker, parachuted in to run the bank a year ago, will launch a survey this week of its 4.7 million customers with a view to updating its existing ethical criteria, first introduced in 1992. The bank's continued ability to describe itself as ethical has come into question since last year's crisis, which has left the Co-operative Group of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies \u2013 the UK's largest mutual \u2013 with a stake of just 20% in the bank it once owned outright. But writing in the Guardian, Booker defends the bank's ethical stance, even though it is now owned by an array of investors, including US hedge funds. \"Our ethical policy helps us define not just what we don't do, but what we do do, the way we behave and the stance we take. It's what makes us different as a bank, and we need to protect it,\" Booker wrote. \"We need to rebuild the reputation of banks and bankers as trusted custodians of people's money, giving objective, impartial advice untainted by opportunities for personal gain, and at the same time make banking transactions as frictionless as possible. At a time when the BBC is bringing back Dad's Army, Captain Mainwaring updated for the digital age should make a return to banking,\" he added. The ethical policy currently covers five areas \u2013 human rights, international development, economic development, the environment and animal welfare \u2013 and the poll includes new questions covering these areas, such as the inclusion of GM food, mass surveillance and fracking. But as the Co-op Bank is no longer involved in lending to big companies, the poll will include three new issues covering the bank's approach to its customers \u2013 responsible banking, transparency, and the fair treatment of customers. Lord Myners, who was brought in to devise reforms for the group but who left the board last month, has said the bank's bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance had showed that \"the ethical credentials were not so deeply embedded as some people assumed\". Earlier this year \u2013 just months after an emergency \u00a31.5bn capital injection \u2013 the bank had to ask for another \u00a3400m to cover the cost of a string of misconduct issues, including PPI. Referring to the events leading to last year's crisis, Booker said: \"We got ourselves into a mess, like some other banks. And yet we have a proud tradition of doing things differently.\" He said the survey of customers would be \"an important step in our rehabilitation\". The bank has polled its customers on its ethical stance four times since 1992, most recently six years ago. Last month Laura Carstensen, a commissioner at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, was appointed to chair the bank's ethical and values committee. Separately, the Co-op Group conducted a poll of its members and the public three months ago, but those findings have not yet been made public, following the departure of its chief executive, Euan Sutherland, after details of his \u00a36.6m two-year pay deal were leaked to the Observer.",

      "bodyText": "Booming sales of televisions, beer and replica football shirts are set to kick off a bonanza for retailers as the UK prepares for the pain, and potential joy, of this year's World Cup. With nearly two-thirds of the country preparing to watch at least some games in football's biggest tournament, which gets underway on 12 June, supermarkets and electrical shops are expected to be the biggest winners. Of the \u00a3814m Brits are expected to spend before and during the games in Brazil, \u00a3359m is likely to be splashed on new TVs, radios and speakers, while \u00a3271m will be spent on snacks and drinks, according to analysts at Conlumino. \"Supermarkets take the opportunity to run promotions on food and drink and it adds a bit on top of the normal summer boost from barbecues, although it does depend on the weather,\" said Matt Piner, research director at Conlumino. Sainsbury's says it expects sales of beer and cider to be more than double those during a normal week while fans will snap up more than 280,000 England flags in its stores and more than 30,000 World Cup footballs. Tesco, meanwhile, thinks it will sell twice as much beer as normal while barbecue foods and snacks such as crisps and nuts will be up 25%. Tesco beer category spokeswoman, Natasha Pitman, said: \"The World Cup is the biggest sporting event on the planet and will create a month-long carnival-like atmosphere for millions of football fans at home.\" A good run for England could be a fillip for major supermarkets, who have been struggling to cope with the rising popularity of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl as shoppers generally tighten their belts. Dave McCarthy, a retail analyst at HSBC, said: \"The better England do, the more opportunities there are for supermarkets and the World Cup may provide some short-term relief.\" But he warned: \"In the face of the structural issues they have got, like the rise of the discounters, it will prove insignificant.\" Supermarkets are not the only ones praying that England stay in the tournament beyond the group stage \u2013 the more games Rooney and his team-mates play the better it is for electrical stores and sports shops. John Kempner, the television buyer for John Lewis, which saw a 47% year-on-year rise in sales of flatscreen TVs in the last week of May, says more fans will buy a new set if England make it to the semi-finals or the finals. While some analysts say a World Cup merely encourages people to buy their TVs earlier \u2013 so sales for the year will be flat \u2013 Kempner says the competition is generally worth an extra 5% to 10% in TV sales to John Lewis as people trade up to larger and more hi-tech sets. But he adds: \"In previous years we've seen the sales increase stop when England fall out of the competition.\" Those selling replica kit are also praying that England's boys have a good run. Peter Cowgill, chairman of sports fashion retailer JD Sports, said: \"If the team do well there's a feelgood factor and that drives footfall into stores. A good performance from England brings about general social interaction so that people want to buy shirts and trainers.\" Many shoppers complain of the high price of football shirts that replicate the kit worn by their country's top 11, and data from Kantar Worldpanel indicates that prices do tend to rise in a World Cup year. In 2010, for example, the number of shirts sold rose 70%, but the total value of shirts sold soared 86% to \u00a342.2m as prices were increased year-on-year. Despite that, Cowgill insists that profits margins on the shirts for retailers were low. Another sports retail industry insider agreed. He added: \"Yes, there's a benefit to profits when the tournament is going on but afterwards sales go the other way.\" Bookmakers can expect to collect a record \u00a3800m during the World Cup as British punters increasingly place bets via their smartphones and tablet computers. Total stakes made online are expected to reach up to \u00a3600m according to research by Regulus Partners, up as much as 60% on the last World Cup in South Africa. However, bookies are likely to suffer in the unlikely event that England lift the trophy or if the tournament hosts, Brazil, secure a much-longed-for win at home. With Brazil shirts selling second best to England shirts in the UK, the home team are clearly seen as a second favourite by Brits.",

This IPO has to take off because if the first tranche is a flop it's a very poor precedent for the other 75% they will be selling later on.

Saga, the over-50s insurance and travel business, was forced to value the company at the bottom of a price range its buyout firm owners had already cut under pressure from investors.</p> <p>Fund managers started driving a harder bargain after several recently listed companies' shares fell below their IPO prices, ringing alarm bells about pricy valuations.</p> <p>AO World, the online kitchen appliance and TV retailer, signalled the return of IPO fever when it floated in February. Its shares rose by more than a third on the first day of trading but the shares have been below the float price for two months.</p> <p>Other high-profile floats to leave early investors short changed include retailers Pets at Home and Card Factory and online takeaway food service Just Eat.</p> <p>The market picked up to \u00a38.04bn last year, helped by the successful flotation of insurer Direct Line and the high-profile listing of Royal Mail, whose shares surged by more than a third on the first day of trading.</p>",

Property website Zoopla, discount retailer B&amp;M and easyHotel, the budget hotel chain, are also set to list in the next few weeks, despite increasing wariness from investors swamped by new offers. Ivor Pether, a senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, said: \"I'll be looking at TSB closely because it's a forced disposal, and the market knows that Lloyds has to sell the rest by the end of 2015 so it has to be priced attractively. This IPO has to take off because if the first tranche is a flop it's a very poor precedent for the other 75% they will be selling later on. That means we may get the IPO discount we would expect and that we haven't been getting in a lot of other issues.\" The market was gripped by IPO fever in the first few months of this year as investors threw off years of caution in search of companies that could benefit from the recovering economy and returning consumer confidence. Retailers and online businesses were high on fund managers lists. But after initial enthusiasm, investors have become wary of the valuations placed on companies by their sellers', which are often private equity firms seeking to unload businesses they bought before the financial crisis. Simon Gergel, head of UK equities at Allianz Global Investors, said: \"Many of the recent IPOs have gone at a premium. I look to see a good reason to buy the business given that investors have far more information than the buyers. In most cases the vendors know the business and they pick their moment. \"You often get a lot of IPOs towards the top of the market. The valuations in many areas are looking a bit extended and investors need to be careful.\" Game, the video game retailer owned by a US hedge fund, on Friday priced its flotation at the bottom of the 200p to 212p range it had proposed to investors the day before. Fat Face pulled its planned IPO last month after investors refused to meet the \u00a3400m-plus price demanded by the casualwear retailer's private equity owners. Saga, the over-50s insurance and travel business, was forced to value the company at the bottom of a price range its buyout firm owners had already cut under pressure from investors. Fund managers started driving a harder bargain after several recently listed companies' shares fell below their IPO prices, ringing alarm bells about pricy valuations. AO World, the online kitchen appliance and TV retailer, signalled the return of IPO fever when it floated in February. Its shares rose by more than a third on the first day of trading but the shares have been below the float price for two months. Other high-profile floats to leave early investors short changed include retailers Pets at Home and Card Factory and online takeaway food service Just Eat. The market picked up to \u00a38.04bn last year, helped by the successful flotation of insurer Direct Line and the high-profile listing of Royal Mail, whose shares surged by more than a third on the first day of trading.",

    "webTitle": "Will George Osborne pay for his economic short-termism?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne is a dab hand at sales patter. Arriving as chancellor four years ago, his aim was to hammer home the idea that all the problems of the economy were the fault of the previous Labour government. The line was that Gordon Brown had \"failed to mend the roof while the sun was shining\". That worked well. To this day, opinion polls show voters think Labour was to blame for the cataclysm that befell the economy in 2008. The chancellor's next soundbite was \"we are all in this together\". The intention here was to show that the pain of coping with the legacy of Labour would be shared. This was less potent politically. In part that was because the economy stalled soon after Osborne moved into the Treasury and moved sideways for two years afterwards. In part, it was because the public took one look at the cabinet and decided that \"posh boys\" did not really understand what belt-tightening was all about. Now we are into Osborne 3.0. The message now is that the long-term plan is working and Britain must stick to it. In the 11 months that remain before the next general election, the idea is to draw all the themes together in one narrative: Labour screwed up the economy and that required Britain as a nation to make sacrifices. But staying the course has been worth it. Abandoning the plan now would mean handing power back the clueless bunch that made such a mess of things in the first place. One obvious flaw with Osborne's narrative is that the government doesn't really have a long term plan. It used to have a long-term plan based around export drives, investment and a new model of growth that did not rely on consumer debt. Now it has a short-term plan to keep the economy going at full throttle until polling day. Let's examine some of the evidence, starting with the Conservative party manifesto of 2010. This said: \"A sustainable recovery must be driven by growth in exports.\" There is nothing wrong with that sentiment. Indeed, given that the UK has run a visible trade deficit every year for more than three decades, it is an entirely laudable objective. But despite the boost from a 30% depreciation of sterling between the middle of 2007 and early 2009, it has not been delivered. The trade figures remain stubbornly in the red, while the broader current account \u2013 which takes into account investment income \u2013 is running a deficit of 5.5% of national output. In his first budget, in June 2010, the new chancellor fleshed out his plans. He would slash government borrowing over the next five years while building an entirely different sort of economic model. \"Our policy is to raise from the ruins of an economy built on debt a new, balanced economy where we save, invest and export.\" Again, nothing to quibble with there. But the years of flatlining have meant that Osborne has missed his deficit reduction targets by a mile. In that first budget speech he said net borrowing would be \u00a337bn in the current year. The latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility put it at close to \u00a3100bn. Nor has there been a pickup in private investment during this parliament. When adjusted for depreciation and dilapidation, capital formation by the non-financial private sector stood at \u00a343bn in 2008. It then halved to \u00a321bn in 2009, then carried on falling to just over \u00a314bn \u2013 less than 1% of GDP \u2013 in 2013. In recent quarters there has been a modest pickup in private capital spending, but there is a mountain to climb. The lack of investment for the past six years helps explain why productivity is so weak. As for the idea that the new government wanted nothing to do with the failed debt-sodden splurges of unsustainable growth Britain has seen in the past, that resolve did not last much beyond mid-term, when the Conservative party started to count down the days to May 2015. Government borrowing targets were quietly (and sensibly) amended to make them less onerous. The Funding for Lending scheme provided banks with incentives to lend to the mortgage market (eagerly seized) and to small businesses (not so eagerly seized). And a new governor of the Bank of England arrived with a message for borrowers that they didn't have to worry about interest rates going up any time soon. In the circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the housing market is going gangbusters. Nor is it that remarkable that the economy is growing at just over 3%, given the fact that official borrowing costs have been at 0.5% for more than five years. In normal circumstances, the economy can be expected to grow by around 2% a year due to population growth and technological advance. Rather more noteworthy is why, under Osborne's stewardship, an economy that was growing at an annual rate of around 2% in the spring of 2010 has taken so long to recoup the ground lost in the recession. Strong growth will continue between now and the election. It may even result in a rise in real incomes. But as with investment, it will not be nearly enough to compensate for what has happened since 2008. National output will get back to its pre-recession levels in the current quarter, but that is only because the population has been rising. Real disposable incomes per head are well down on where they were when the recession began and even now wages are struggling to keep pace with prices. Osborne has two things going for him. The first is that unless the Bank of England overdoes measures to cool down the property market, the economy will remain strong for the next 12 months. The second is that the opposition is making such a feeble fist of things. Osborne only really has a short-term plan, but at least he has a plan of some description. Labour has a collection of policies, some of them attractive ones, but it has to bring them together in a coherent and convincing strategy. Opinion polls reflect this. Some voters may see Osborne as a snake oil salesman arriving in town in a covered wagon to dispense potions at a medicine show. But they see Ed Balls as even more of a quack doctor. Labour was badly damaged early on in this parliament by Osborne's ability to get his version of politics accepted as the received wisdom. It is in danger of being caught flat-footed again, although it doesn't need to be. Why? Because the short-term nature of government economic policy provides Labour with the opportunity to lay out a genuine long-term plan for how Britain kicks the mortgage-debt habit, retools industry, rewards work, and pays its way in the world. But it needs to sharpen up its act, and quickly.",

      "bodyText": "As in most areas of London, the crawling pace of the school run for parents in Brixton can be a frustrating experience. More damaging to the health than the daily stress, however, is the effect on the air quality made by thousands of cars driving short distances. In an effort to cut down on avoidable pollution, the private and public sectors have collaborated in recent months to encourage parents to walk their children to school in the south London district while changes in air pollution are monitored using specialised sensors. The Walk the Talk initiative is a joint effort between technology company Intel, the Technology Strategy Board (TSB), Transport for London and Lambeth council among others to solve a common societal problem by using the expertise of a range of bodies working together. It an example of the latest development of \"open innovation\", a phrase coined by academic Henry Chesbrough to describe how companies use outside help and collaboration to solve problems. In the case of Brixton, and another project in Enfield, Intel and the TSB have combined to create \"living labs\" or test areas where experiments to resolve problems can take place. Martin Curley, the director of Intel Labs Europe, one of the company's research arms, said recent years have seen an increase in companies collaborating to resolve problems that are common to sectors as a whole, a phenomenon that is now taking in broader elements of society. While once research and development departments were once secretive secure dens, this has now relaxed, he said. Curley added: \"They [problems] are too large to be tackled in isolation, and actually by working together we are able to pool our resources, we are able to go faster and do it more efficiently and we can share the risks and lower the risks. \"I think it is really in the last four or five years [that] these outward-facing labs have become much more significant and there has been a shift from the secretive white-coated labs to labs that are outward facing and more open. \"There is this recognition ... that the most effective kind of innovation and where you can drive broad structural change is where you have physical labs in companies but you have this intertwining of the opportunity to create this shared vision between industry, academia and broader society. When we work together we can move much faster together.\" At BT's sprawling research and development HQ in Adastral Park near Ipswich, the two companies have been collaborating on projects involving telecommunications infrastructure since last May. A facility for the software corporation SAP to work with Intel was previously set up in Belfast. Tim Whitley, BT's managing director for research and development, said 50,000 visitor passes are issued each year at Adastral Park. Sections of the facility are designed as operating theatres, banks, living rooms and high streets so that customers, academics and technologists can brainstorm in simulated environments to solve problems using technology that has been created or sourced by the company. \"It is a very good way for bringing technology into the context that is relevant to the person who ultimately would be the user,\" said Whitley, who credited the collaborative approach for the creation of BT Global Trace, a cloud-based supply chain management system, which was developed with a major parcel company. Collaboration is frequently initiated through journals and research publications at a stage before competition has begun between companies and there is a \"well-worn model\" for defining the rules of engagement, he said. \"The purpose of collaboration is that you both mutually learn, you both enhance your position in the market and that might lead to some business \u2013 it may or may not,\" said Whitley. Curley said it was often better to work with firms that have complimentary interests rather than direct competitors but that when a problem is sufficiently large, rivals can be brought in. \"By pooling knowledge, we can create solutions we each can't solve,\" he said. A new BBC website, Referend-erm?, designed to inform young people about the upcoming Scottish independence referendum, is the result of a joint venture between the BBC and digital agency Realise over a nine-month period. Adrian Woolard, who heads up the Connected Studio, the corporation's innovation programme for online, said: \"The reason that the BBC wants to work with third parties is you recognise that you do some things very, very well. The BBC is an innovative organisation but the world has changed and lots of very good ideas exist in very, very small companies outside the BBC who wouldn't necessarily think to come and work with us or become a regular supplier.\" Among the 31 projects that have resulted from outside collaborations are Weatherbot, where users can request a personal forecast for a time and place. Awareness difficulties exist among companies outside the media sphere who could be involved with the BBC, said Woolard. \"We are really keen to diversify the types of companies which come and take part. A lot in the media industry would know about it but not away from it,\" he said. Curley said the advances of open innovation, from a stage where research was \"internal and secret\" to the current collaborative system was becoming the standard across industry although there are still some companies which do not engage. \"I suspect they are companies which won't be around for a long time,\" he said. An open innovation conference will take place in Dublin later this week. \"Having the corporate sophistication to compete and collaborate is a necessity,\" said Whitley. What are the labs? Although they may draw images of sombre and disciplined technicians in white coats, labs in the modern industrial context are a nebulous idea. Some companies use the concept as a shorthand for a research and development department. Others describe them as an area, inside or outside a firm, where experiments with technology take place. Others describe them as a project to be completed. \"A lab is a focused period of time where the larger company comes together with small, light agile companies focused around a common problem space, which they then solve collaboratively or alongside each other,\" said Woolard.",

More damaging to the health than the daily stress, however, is the effect on the air quality made by thousands of cars driving short distances.</p> <p>In an effort to cut down on avoidable pollution, the private and public sectors have collaborated in recent months to encourage parents to walk their children to school in the south London district while changes in air pollution are monitored using specialised sensors.</p> <p>The Walk the Talk initiative is a joint effort between technology company Intel, the Technology Strategy Board (TSB), Transport for London and Lambeth council among others to solve a common societal problem by using the expertise of a range of bodies working together.</p> <p>It an example of the latest development of \"open innovation\", a phrase coined by academic Henry Chesbrough to describe how companies use outside help and collaboration to solve problems. In the case of Brixton, and another project in Enfield, Intel and the TSB have combined to create \"living labs\" or test areas where experiments to resolve problems can take place.</p> <p>Martin Curley, the director of Intel Labs Europe, one of the company's research arms, said recent years have seen an increase in companies collaborating to resolve problems that are common to sectors as a whole, a phenomenon that is now taking in broader elements of society. While once research and development departments were once secretive secure dens, this has now relaxed, he said.</p> <p>Curley added: \"They [problems] are too large to be tackled in isolation, and actually by working together we are able to pool our resources, we are able to go faster and do it more efficiently and we can share the risks and lower the risks.</p> <p>\"I think it is really in the last four or five years [that] these outward-facing labs have become much more significant and there has been a shift from the secretive white-coated labs to labs that are outward facing and more open.</p> <p>\"There is this recognition ... that the most effective kind of innovation and where you can drive broad structural change is where you have physical labs in companies but you have this intertwining of the opportunity to create this shared vision between industry, academia and broader society. When we work together we can move much faster together.\"</p> <p>At BT's sprawling research and development HQ in Adastral Park near Ipswich, the two companies have been collaborating on projects involving telecommunications infrastructure since last May.</p> <p>A facility for the software corporation SAP to work with Intel was previously set up in Belfast.</p> <p>Tim Whitley, BT's managing director for research and development, said 50,000 visitor passes are issued each year at Adastral Park. Sections of the facility are designed as operating theatres, banks, living rooms and high streets so that customers, academics and technologists can brainstorm in simulated environments to solve problems using technology that has been created or sourced by the company.</p> <p>\"It is a very good way for bringing technology into the context that is relevant to the person who ultimately would be the user,\" said Whitley, who credited the collaborative approach for the creation of BT Global Trace, a cloud-based supply chain management system, which was developed with a major parcel company.</p> <p>Collaboration is frequently initiated through journals and research publications at a stage before competition has begun between companies and there is a \"well-worn model\" for defining the rules of engagement, he said.</p> <p>\"The purpose of collaboration is that you both mutually learn, you both enhance your position in the market and that might lead to some business \u2013 it may or may not,\" said Whitley.</p> <p>Curley said it was often better to work with firms that have complimentary interests rather than direct competitors but that when a problem is sufficiently large, rivals can be brought in. \"By pooling knowledge, we can create solutions we each can't solve,\" he said.</p> <p>A new BBC website, <a href=\"http://referend-erm.com/\" title=\"\">Referend-erm?</a>, designed to inform young people about the upcoming Scottish independence referendum, is the result of a joint venture between the BBC and digital agency Realise over a nine-month period.</p> <p>Adrian Woolard, who heads up the Connected Studio, the corporation's innovation programme for online, said: \"The reason that the BBC wants to work with third parties is you recognise that you do some things very, very well.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For consumers struggling with food bills, last week seemed to bring a glimmer of hope, as bad news for retailers promised good news on prices. Once again that leviathan of the high street, Tesco, reported appalling sales figures, down 3.1% from a year earlier. One million fewer customers are visiting the stores each week. Meanwhile the discounters, chains such as Aldi and Lidl, are cleaning up, with sales increases of an astonishing 35.9% and 22.5% respectively. Earlier this year, as profits slumped, Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke announced \u00a3200m worth of price cuts. Last week analysts called for more. \"Two hundred million in cuts is nothing,\" said John Ibbotson, of consultants Retail Vision. \"Clarke's only option now is to get out the big bazooka and blow the competition away.\" Spurred by sales down 7.1%, the worst for a generation, Morrison's has also been offering bargains. A supermarket price war is under way, with Asda and Sainsbury's piling in, which can only be good news for shoppers. Or perhaps not. For just as Tesco was sharing its dismal trading figures, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was releasing statistics on Britain's food self-sufficiency. They revealed the cumulative effect of those price wars on our ability to feed ourselves. For the third year in a row, self-sufficiency was down, from a peak in 1984 of 78% to 60% now. And many believe that's an overestimate. What's more, when one calculates in products exported the amount that we consume in the UK that is actually produced here falls to around 50%. Much of that decline is being attributed to the brutal deals on price enforced by the mighty supermarkets. In the mid-80s we grew 4 million hectares of wheat. Now it's 3.14 million. The national sheep flock has fallen by a third. The only land usage that has increased \u2013 by a factor of four since 1984 \u2013 is of \"uncropped agricultural land\" or, more prosaically, farmland that isn't being farmed. \"Much of this is land that would have shown a small profit a few years ago and simply doesn't now because of the prices being paid,\" said Guy Smith, vice-president of the National Farmers Union. It makes more sense for farmers to collect the European Union single farm payment, calculated on land size, than to attempt to make money out of it. Why does this matter? After all, we live in a globalised world. Clearly we're supplying our needs from the international markets. The problem is twofold. First, in the future those international markets will be far less reliable, at least at a price British consumers can stomach. There has been a global explosion of affluence, especially in Asia. At the beginning of this century, 14% of the world's middle classes were there. By 2050, 68% will be in Asia, and they are insisting on eating as we do, with meat consumption in China alone almost quadrupling over the past three decades. Already Chinese retailers are willing to pay more for ungraded, unpacked apples than British supermarkets will pay for graded and packed. The simple laws of supply and demand mean that all edible commodities are going to be under pressure. At least if we have access to a robust internal food market we'll be protected from some of the worst price excesses. But there is another, more moral issue. The global population is expected to rise from seven billion now to more than nine billion by 2050. The United Nations estimates that by 2030 we will need to be producing 50% more food globally on the same or even less land. What's more, the latest report from the UN Panel on Climate Change actually predicates a 2% drop in food production. In short, every country needs to do its bit. And we aren't. Although we measure food production as a proportion of self-sufficiency, 100% self-sufficiency in the UK is neither an achievable nor desirable goal. Certain countries such as France and the United States may proudly boast that they are more than 100% self-sufficient, but they have far lower population densities than Britain. What's more, an international trade in food is a valuable mechanism for growth in the developing world. Even so, this country still has the capacity to get back above the 70% self-sufficiency it achieved 30 years ago. It's noticeable that the decline, which kicked in through the late 80s and early 90s, corresponds directly with a Thatcherite change in planning laws that allowed for the massive expansion of the supermarket sector into out-of-town megastores and, with it, the wars on price that have forced so many British farmers to give up farming. Depressingly, questioned a few months ago by MPs on the environment, food and rural affairs select committee about the collapse in our self-sufficiency, farms minister George Eustice said it didn't trouble him. \"If you go back to the 1930s, before the second world war, self-sufficiency at that point was between 30% and 40%,\" he said, displaying a lack of historical perspective. Back then we still had an empire. We treated food production in the colonies as our own, to be plundered as we wished. Worryingly, Labour doesn't appear to be any more across the issue. Last year I attempted to engage with the then opposition frontbench environment and agriculture team. I suggested they should argue that food prices had to rise to enable farmers to invest; they said they couldn't possibly do that because it would harm their vote. Perhaps, but not quite as much as will civil disorder as a result of food shortages, were Labour to be elected. Ironically, unlike the Labour party, Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke did actually tell this newspaper, in an interview last year, that food prices would have to rise. It was part of a charm offensive following the horsemeat scandal, during which he also addressed the NFU conference and told farmers that the retailer had changed, would be looking after producers and paying them better. He appeared to recognise his job as custodian of the food supply chain. But that was before Aldi and Lidl eroded his market share. The problem is that Tesco is now fighting a battle it simply cannot win. The assumption had long been that if you shopped at a discounter such as Aldi or Lidl you were compromising on quality. Consumers now know this isn't the case. By stocking single lines of products \u2013 one type of unbranded chocolate biscuit or ham against the 15 or 20 big-name brands in Tesco or Morrison's \u2013 the discounters have economies of scale that enable them to charge less without eroding quality. What's more, they are renowned for paying their suppliers a fair price. And it turns out consumers are more than willing to trade choice for price. Meanwhile, the big four keep trying to add value through choice and service while also competing on price, which simply isn't possible. The best British farmers can hope for in the short term is that the price they're being paid won't go down, though inevitably if a price war is drawn out those costs will be passed on. That would be disastrous \u2013 because if we are going to improve our self-sufficiency, farmers need to be paid enough to invest in our agricultural base. We actually need to pay a little more for our food now to avoid paying much more later. A price war might be good for consumers in the short term. It might offer some sort of relief. In the long term, however, we would all be much the poorer.",
