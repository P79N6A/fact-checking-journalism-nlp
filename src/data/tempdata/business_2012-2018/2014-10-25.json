The rest of us may be baffled that the slowest trudge out of recession in history has been followed by the fastest growth of any advanced economy. You may be asking why unemployment has tumbled, yet wages have not risen. And why all that austerity, only for George Osborne to have drifted further from his deficit goals? But for MPs gearing up for an election, it is a take-your-pick kind of recovery. One man\u2019s Britain mired in a \u201ccost-of-living crisis\u201d (Ed Balls) is another\u2019s \u201cemployment powerhouse\u201d (Danny Alexander). It is this discrepancy in the jobs market that is most widely felt and keenly pondered. Employment is rising fast and yet wages are falling once inflation is taken into account. What this means for pay has been totted up by various politicians and economists. Labour says average wages after inflation are down \u00a31,600 a year since 2010. Another estimate, from Professor Paul Gregg at the University of Bath, is \u00a35,000 a year. Real wages are some 20% below where they would be had trend wage growth continued over the past six years, he says. Plenty of reasons have been put forward for this. There has been a surge in self-employment, where pay is often low. There is a bigger supply of labour. Companies have resorted to cheap labour to make money rather than investing in machinery or innovations. So employment has stayed high but the money available to pay each employee is tight. This last factor is crucial. So long as Britain fails to do something about its stagnant productivity \u2013 output per hour worked \u2013 the money to share out will remain tight. Productivity is no higher than it was six years ago. This \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d puts the UK way behind other advanced economies. The sunniest optimists tell us productivity will soon take off and then so, too, will wage growth. The more cautious optimists tell us that if, and only if, productivity rises, can wages rise too. But the pessimists paint another picture: productivity eventually picks up and real wages rise only for the top earners. That\u2019s the productivity puzzle solved to be replaced by the pay puzzle. Their pessimism is rooted in recent history, which appears to show what Gregg has called a decoupling of wages from productivity. Gregg noted that \u201cordinary British workers are no longer benefiting from improvements in economic efficiency in the economy,\u201d in a policy brief for his university\u2019s Institute of Policy Research (IPR). Median wages per hour \u2013 the hourly pay received by the typical British worker \u2013 have been growing below productivity since the early 1990s, and markedly so since the early 2000s, he notes. It is a phenomenon the UK shares with the US, and when you think about what those two have in common you begin to explain where the gains are going. Against a backdrop of rising inequality, the benefits from any efficiency improvement have disproportionately flowed to funding pensions and rewarding executives. The Resolution Foundation has also looked at ordinary workers experiencing growth without gain. Its Commission on Living Standards highlighted distribution changes. In 1977, of every \u00a3100 of value generated in the UK economy, workers in the bottom half of the earnings distribution received \u00a316 as wages; by 2010 this share had fallen to \u00a312. Workers in the top 10% increased their share of value from \u00a312 to \u00a314 over the same period. One solution to this problem of low and falling pay that is not talked about enough is simply to pay more at the bottom. How do you that before productivity rises? You do it so that productivity will rise. This sounds too easy to be true, but the living wage movement is providing a growing number of examples of where higher pay has bred higher productivity, rather than vice versa. One good illustration comes from a sector not usually renowned for productivity growth nor decent pay. London-based home care provider Penrose Care was one of the first in its sector to sign up to the living wage, set at \u00a38.80 an hour in London and \u00a37.65 elsewhere, compared with the national minimum wage at \u00a36.50. Penrose\u2019s staff turnover is close to zero, as is the number of sick days, says co-founder Robert Stephenson-Padron. Higher morale among carers means clients are happier and reviews are positive. The company has won contracts despite charging more than some rivals. Consultancy KPMG says it cut the cost of running its buildings by introducing the living wage along with more flexible shifts and more holiday for cleaners and other staff. Turnover dropped and workers were happy to take on more responsibility. These are just two of many examples. Research has found that there can indeed be a virtuous circle from higher pay to higher productivity. The Living Wage Commission said raising coverage of the living wage alongside improved training could even plug the UK\u2019s productivity gap with the other G7 countries. That is wishful thinking. But it is better than shaky promises that a return to productivity growth will herald the long-awaited wage recovery. On recent trends there is every chance it will merely make the rich richer. Employers would do well to try another way. Raise pay and watch productivity follow.",

      "bodyText": "There is growing unease as the US central bank prepares to turn off its printing presses. Over five years the Federal Reserve has pumped almost $4.5 trillion into the US economy, in a desperate effort to counter the effects of recession and the collapse of hundreds of banks following the financial crash. Next week the Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen will allocate the last tranche of new money, having wound down from a regular $85bn of quantitative easing (QE) a month to a final $15bn. Some analysts believe the decision to stop the extra spending is a reflection of the US economy\u2019s robust recovery. Falling unemployment, a return to health across the banking sector and consistently strong manufacturing growth all conjure thoughts of a return to pre-recession normality. Given the huge amounts of money that poured into the US stock market last year, triggering a rise in the S&amp;P 500 of almost 30%, most investors thought the same. But they have proved more cautious in 2014, restricting the S&amp;P 500 to a 6% increase so far. Disturbed by the lack of similar action in Brussels and in Frankfurt \u2013 home of the European Central Bank \u2013 investors fear that the eurozone is sliding ever closer to recession. They are also worried about a sharp slowdown in China, following moves by the ruling People\u2019s party to tackle escalating state sector debts. Wild price swings in global stock markets earlier this month were a signal that investors remain ready to pull their funds at a moment\u2019s notice. In this febrile atmosphere, the Fed\u2019s next move could be crucial. Yellen appears ready to maintain the $4.5tn cache of bonds and mortgage-backed securities that make up the bulk of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. As the bonds mature, she will buy new ones to keep the balance steady. But she may be edging away from raising interest rates from 0.25%, a move pencilled in by many economists for February. There was a time when it appeared that the US and UK would both raise rates in concert, and February was the chosen date. A downturn in the UK\u2019s growth outlook has scuppered that idea. But the US economy may be suffering the same malaise. Manufacturing figures last week showed the sector expanding at a much slower rate than just a few months ago. Midterm elections next month could see the Democrats lose control of the Senate and break an uneasy truce over economic policy. So the Fed may be only be a few meetings away from declaring that the US needs more QE and find itself delaying a rise in rates. More cheap money would cheer stock market investors. If ECB chief Mario Draghi could persuade the Germans to let him spend some money buying Greek and Spanish debt, that would cheer investors even more. Much of the growth in recent years has followed explicit commitments from central bankers to underwrite the debts of governments. German chancellor Angela Merkel refuses to accept that the ECB is the central bank for Madrid or Athens, arguing that it has a broader purpose, but she may find herself overruled by the rest of the currency club, frantic at Berlin\u2019s stubbornness. Figures next month are expected to show the eurozone contracting in the third quarter following stagnation in the second. Eventual ECB action looks inevitable. Anything less then the full bazooka from Draghi will be deemed a disappointment. Even if Japan allows its central bank to spend money, the combined impact of a weak response in Europe, a tightening by Beijing and stasis in the US could send the world somersaulting towards another crisis. Jeff can\u2019t defy gravity for ever You can buy \u201cantigravity boots\u201d on Amazon \u2013 springloaded devices that bounce you into the air at every stride before you return to earth again, to bounce skyward once more. Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, clearly has something even better underneath the retailer\u2019s shares, which have soared over the years despite minimal profits. But the flight may have ended. On Thursday Amazon reported a $544m third-quarter operating loss (including a $170m writeoff for its Fire Phone) on sales up 20% to $20.6bn. The shares opened down 6% on Friday, but are still at a price/earnings ratio of about 750. No, there\u2019s no missing decimal point: it\u2019s over 700. For all the fury Amazon inspires, it clearly doesn\u2019t care about being liked or making profits. Bezos ploughs the money back into the business, aiming to become the world\u2019s largest retailer. Share price doesn\u2019t matter to him, because Amazon has plenty of cash. There\u2019s only one problem. Sales growth is strong, but slowing, because the market is becoming saturated, and new competitors, including Google, are trying to get into online retail and delivery. (Google\u2019s Eric Schmidt sees Amazon has his principal competition.) Meanwhile, though Amazon has ridden high on the desktop internet boom, the shift to mobile is a challenge: if people buy from store-specific apps, Amazon could lose out. That\u2019s why Fire Phone\u2019s flameout is bad news: it\u2019s costly, and it means Amazon hasn\u2019t captured a slice of loyal mobile users. With more than half of Amazon\u2019s revenues still coming from the US, there might seem to be plenty of room for expansion. But English-speaking countries like the UK are already oversupplied with online retailers, and expansion in other countries means fighting entrenched competitors. If Europe wipes out the tax-shuffling arrangements Amazon benefits from, its performance will look even worse. No doubt it will have a record Christmas. But at some point, financial gravity will exert its influence on Amazon, as it did on Tesco. Then Bezos will really need to raise Amazon\u2019s game. What women want Moya Greene, chief executive of Royal Mail, spoke about women\u2019s ambitions in the workplace last week. \u201cOne of the most important things to do is to help women take ownership of their ambition and aspirations. It\u2019s still disappointing when you see how young women view their ambition \u2013 and how others view that ambition. To be a chief executive, it\u2019s really hard work and you really have to want to do it. For women, even in 2014, that can be a problem.\u201d As one of only five female bosses running FTSE 100 companies, Greene seems to be suggesting that women lack the drive to get to the top of business. Or is the Canadian businesswoman saying that society does not expect women to harbour the necessary ambition to get to the top? It is probably a bit of both and she is probably right \u2013 just as she was in 2012 when she said she was ready to back a debate about quotas. Sadly, she never did. Let\u2019s have a proper debate this time.",

Or is the Canadian businesswoman saying that society does not expect women to harbour the necessary ambition to get to the top?</p> <p>It is probably a bit of both and she is probably right \u2013 just as she was in 2012 when she said she was ready to back a debate about quotas. Sadly, she never did. Let\u2019s have a proper debate this time.</p>",

He\u2019s been in the job seven weeks, and half his energy will have been consumed by the accounting scandal.By contrast, Tesco\u2019s loss of competitive clout in the UK dates back half a decade, to the time the company was getting sucked into its doomed Fresh &amp; Easy adventure in the US. Yet it was hard to avoid the impression that Lewis is already on the back foot. Dynamic Dave, as he was known at Unilever, did not live up to the billing. His warm words about reconnecting with customers and restoring competitiveness could have been spoken by his predecessor, Philip Clarke. What shareholders \u2013 and shoppers \u2013 want to know is how Tesco will be different under Lewis, who declared: \u201cTesco is always at its best when it puts customers first.\u201d About 99% of retailers would say the same about their businesses. But in a world of finite capital, and with a share price that has halved since the start of the year, the real question at Tesco is: what\u2019s the right balance between prices, service and quality products? Answers, one assumes, will arrive eventually. But the size of the task suddenly seems monumental, given the speed of the decline in sales and profits. \u201cWe continue to believe that Tesco profits could go to zero in the UK, even if it were to generate 1-2% like-for-like [sales increases], because of high running costs,\u201d say analysts at BESI. Their research shows Tesco is 38% more expensive than Aldi on comparable products. For good measure, it reckons the group\u2019s property portfolio, valued at \u00a320bn, may only be worth \u00a38-10bn. In that context, the oddest part of Lewis\u2019s first announcement was the hint that he would prefer to avoid a rights issue: \u201cThere may be something we can do in terms of the other assets.\u201d That seems to imply asset sales. But disposals takes time, and only the Asian operations would raise serious money. They could be worth \u00a39bn but, if Tesco still hopes to return to international expansion one day, they are surely the ones to keep. It would not look good to try to avoid a rights issue but be bounced into one anyway in, say, a year\u2019s time. Many City analysts predict precisely that. Lewis, of course, deserves some sympathy.

But the uncomfortable truth for Tesco is that, under Clarke, three years have been wasted on cul-de-sacs like Blinkbox and Harris + Hoole. Lewis, pondering what made Tesco such a formidable force in the first place, ought to know that one feature was management\u2019s single-minded pursuit of clear strategic goals.

      "bodyText": "\u201cDecreases in oil, gas or product prices are likely to have an adverse effect on revenues, margins and profitability, and a material rapid change, or a sustained change... may mean investment or other decisions need to be reviewed [or] assets may be impaired,\u201d says oil group BP in its annual report. \u201cA prolonged period of low oil prices may impact our cash flow, profit and ability to maintain our long-term investment programme... and may impact shareholder returns.\u201d The comments may have been written by a lawyer with an overwhelming hatred of the English language, but the sentiments are instructive as we await third-quarter results from both BP and Shell this week \u2013 both of which will be delivered against the backdrop of the falling oil price. Since June, the price of a barrel of Brent crude has dropped from about $115 to around $85 and the Economist reckons that if it settles at those levels, the world\u2019s oil bill will be about $1 trillion cheaper a year. All of which sounds pretty good news unless you happen to be an oil investor, you are persuaded by the arguments about lower prices destabilising the political situation in countries such as Iran, or your name happens to be Vladimir Putin. Some of that group may dial in on the conference calls this week.

      "bodyText": "Sir Terry Leahy used to talk about building a retail empire on which the sun never set: a chain of Tesco stores stretching around the world from San Francisco to Tokyo. Its successful UK business was the cash machine that reliably paid out profits measured in the billions to bankroll expansion around the world. But that old model is irreparably broken: the supermarket giant revealed last week that group pre-tax profits for the first six months of this year were almost completely wiped out by penance for past accounting sins and the collapsing profitability of the ailing UK chain. But with the results out of the way, and the first chapter of what promises to be a long-running accounting inquiry complete, new boss Dave Lewis feels it is now safe to leave the country, at least for a couple of days, to inspect his dominion. Having grounded the company fleet of corporate jets permanently, he will join hoi polloi on a gruelling long-haul flight to the Far East. He will have a lot to think about en route: sales are falling in 80% of the countries where Tesco has stores. His first ports of call \u2013 Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea \u2013 were once the jewels in Tesco\u2019s overseas crown, but even they are struggling as political and economic pressures dent sales. Closer to home in Ireland, previously the retailer\u2019s most successful European market, sales are in freefall. Like-for-likes are down a staggering 7.3% at the last count as German discounters Aldi and Lidl and homegrown rivals such as Dunnes and Musgrave eat Tesco\u2019s breakfast, lunch and dinner. Rather than flicking through the in-flight movie channels, Lewis will need to spend his travel time coming up with a battle plan. He also needs to decide how best to raise the cash the group needs to fight a price war at home and alleviate the financial squeeze on its balance sheet. Last week\u2019s first-half results \u2013 delayed by three weeks to allow external accountants to get to the bottom of the hole in profits created by the misbooking of supplier payments \u2013 made grim reading. Pre-tax profits crashed 92% to \u00a3112m on the back of more than \u00a3500m of financial one-offs. In the UK, trading profits more than halved to \u00a3499m while in Asia they were down 17% at \u00a3260m. Summing up the picture, Lewis was frank: \u201cI think relative to the market, we\u2019ve not been as competitive as I would have liked us to be.\u201d In the UK alone, BESI Research analyst Rickin Thakrar says that although its prices have now moved into line with major rivals such as Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s, it is still 38% more expensive than Aldi. Lewis has said that everything is up for review and has thus far refused to rule out a major asset sale \u2013 or even a rights issue further down the line \u2013 to get Tesco\u2019s house in order, telling the City: \u201cWe think that there are significant opportunities for us to extract value from the business that we have \u2013 either from self-help, in terms of cost cuts, or when we review the portfolio against whatever strategy we decide.\u201d Analysts think Tesco\u2019s Asian arm, which includes the successful South Korean chain Home Plus, could be worth as much as \u00a39bn, but others point to less drastic solutions such as the sale of Dunnhumby, the data mining firm behind Clubcard, or hiving off smaller interests such as the Dobbies garden centre chain, to return to its roots as a straightforward supermarket group. So far Lewis has only committed to a domestic cost-cutting drive, starting with its 32 head office buildings, so it can invest more in shopfloor staff. It turns out the accounting scandal \u2013 which revealed the estimate of first-half profits Tesco gave the City back in August had been artificially inflated by \u00a3263m \u2013 was just the tip of the iceberg that the previous management team left for him to negotiate. \u201cIt all stems from the previous management team [led by Philip Clarke] \u2026 they were not brave enough to tell the City the truth,\u201d says one senior supermarket executive. \u201cThey could have gone on the record and said consumers were being hit hard and they needed to invest in the shopping trip to protect sales. It would have hit profits but would have been the right thing to do for the long term.\u201d A trip across the Irish Sea provides a frightening case study of how Tesco has taken its eye off the ball. While in the UK it has four similar rivals to contend with, in Ireland there is only one retailer of its type \u2013 Tesco itself. But it is still being outsmarted by Aldi, Lidl and domestic chains such as Musgrave\u2019s SuperValu. \u201cIn Ireland you have got the rise of the discounters and two strong local players pointing out that Tesco is a British company in trouble,\u201d says Shore Capital analyst Clive Black. \u201cAldi and Lidl are in a big groove, with a combined market share of 19% in Ireland versus 8% in the UK.\u201d Lewis will also need to check out Tesco\u2019s supermarkets in Poland and Hungary, which are also finding life tough as the discounters make their presence felt. \u201cCentral Europe has been awful for a while,\u201d says Black. \u201cThe economies are very weak and the business is hypermarket-based, which is a square peg in a round hole. \u201cThe days of Tesco being a global retailer in Leahy\u2019s vision have gone but its European and Asian businesses together are more profitable than Sainsbury\u2019s and do not require as much capital as they used to, which is an important part as to why we still think Tesco is in control of its own destiny.\u201d Last week Lewis made it clear there was no \u201cbig bang\u201d presentation on the horizon where he would set out his stall to save Tesco. PowerPoint talks give too much commercially sensitive information to rivals, he argued, although the fall in the share price suggests his secretive approach has done little so far to reassure nervous investors who have already watched the value of their shareholdings halve this year. After his first formal outing, the jury is still out on Tesco\u2019s new management team. Analysts and industry watchers say it is too soon to judge the mettle of Lewis and new finance director Alan Stewart, whose tenure can still be measured in weeks. \u201cI think you have got to give Lewis some leeway,\u201d says the supermarket insider. \u201cHe\u2019s been dealt a shit hand and has played it as well as he could.\u201d CHAIRMAN WANTED: MUST ENJOY A CHALLENGE Headhunters are racing to find a replacement for Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent after the former civil servant announced his resignation on Thursday. The ideal candidate would be a seasoned retailer, with exemplary boardroom skills, willing to take on what is fast becoming the mother of all turnaround challenges. He or she will work alongside Dave Lewis, the new chief executive, who has had little time to work on a new strategy for the retailer in his two months in the job since uncovering a \u00a3263m accounting scandal. One leading recruiter said: \u201cPreferably the new chairman should have retail experience, because the new chief executive doesn\u2019t. That experience could be in a non-executive context as long as they have had significant exposure to the retail market. They have also got to be highly respected in the City.\u201d So who might the headhunters place on their list? Archie Norman is the lead candidate. The 60-year-old has been chairman of ITV since 2010 and a non-executive director of Australian supermarket Coles since 2007. The consummate retailer, Norman rejuvenated Asda, sold it to Walmart, then served as Conservative MP for Tunbridge Wells for eight years. A former McKinsey management consultant, He was brought into Coles to help rejuvenate it, and may not be interested in another big turnaround job \u2013 he\u2019s already been there. Sir Ian Cheshire, outgoing boss of B&amp;Q Kingfisher, is another retailer with a track record of taking on troubled firms. During his seven years at the DIY business he cut costs, axed the dividend to preserve cash and cut back its debt. He is popular in the City, but at 55 Cheshire is thought to have his eye on another chief executive\u2019s job rather than a chairmanship. John Gildersleeve joined Tesco in 1965 aged 19, then rose through the ranks to sit on the board for 20 years before retiring in 2004. Since then he has been chairman of tobacco company Gallaher, music company EMI and fashion retailer New Look and as well as Carphone Warehouse. He is now deputy chairman of Carphone Warehouse\u2019s offshoot Talk Talk. He is thought to be keen on the Tesco job, but to some he is too controversial a figure to chair Tesco. \u201cVery outspoken\u201d was the view of one source. Richard Cousins, a newly appointed non-exec at Tesco, is already been cited as a candidate. Cousins is not a retailer, but is chief executive of giant caterer Compass, which employs 470,000 staff. He took that job in 2006 \u2013 when the business was in the mire \u2013 and would have to quit if the chairmanship did appeal. John Allan, chairman of Dixons Retail at the time of its merger with Carphone Warehouse, may also get a mention. Now deputy chairman of the enlarged retailer, he is highly rated and has sat on boards including Deutsche Post and Samsonite. Former banker and trade minister Lord (Mervyn) Davies is not a retailer, but one of the great and good who has served on the Tesco board. He wrote a government report on getting more women into the boardroom and likes big challenges.

Analysts and industry watchers say it is too soon to judge the mettle of Lewis and new finance director Alan Stewart, whose tenure can still be measured in weeks.</p> <p>\u201cI think you have got to give Lewis some leeway,\u201d says the supermarket insider. \u201cHe\u2019s been dealt a shit hand and has played it as well as he could.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b7c1932d8de435e5501bd655472eb8f53c68b6e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/25/1414228987033/de89253d-c0be-476c-9f95-0d95f86e3a45-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A branch of Irish supermarket chain SuperValu in Dublin.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A branch of Irish supermarket chain SuperValu in Dublin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Boal/Photocall Ireland for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>CHAIRMAN WANTED: MUST ENJOY A CHALLENGE</h2> <p>Headhunters are racing to find a replacement for Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent after the former civil servant announced his resignation on Thursday. The ideal candidate would be a seasoned retailer, with exemplary boardroom skills, willing to take on what is fast becoming the mother of all turnaround challenges. He or she will work alongside Dave Lewis, the new chief executive, who has had little time to work on a new strategy for the retailer in his two months in the job since uncovering a \u00a3263m accounting scandal.</p> <p>One leading recruiter said: \u201cPreferably the new chairman should have retail experience, because the new chief executive doesn\u2019t. That experience could be in a non-executive context as long as they have had significant exposure to the retail market. They have also got to be highly respected in the City.\u201d</p> <p>So who might the headhunters place on their list?</p> <p><strong>Archie Norman</strong> is the lead candidate. The 60-year-old has been chairman of ITV since 2010 and a non-executive director of Australian supermarket Coles since 2007. The consummate retailer, Norman rejuvenated Asda, sold it to Walmart, then served as Conservative MP for Tunbridge Wells for eight years. A former McKinsey management consultant, He was brought into Coles to help rejuvenate it, and may not be interested in another big turnaround job \u2013 he\u2019s already been there.</p> <p><strong>Sir Ian Cheshire</strong>, outgoing boss of B&amp;Q Kingfisher, is another retailer with a track record of taking on troubled firms. During his seven years at the DIY business he cut costs, axed the dividend to preserve cash and cut back its debt. He is popular in the City, but at 55 Cheshire is thought to have his eye on another chief executive\u2019s job rather than a chairmanship.</p> <p><strong>John Gildersleeve</strong> joined Tesco in 1965 aged 19, then rose through the ranks to sit on the board for 20 years before retiring in 2004. Since then he has been chairman of tobacco company Gallaher, music company EMI and fashion retailer New Look and as well as Carphone Warehouse. He is now deputy chairman of Carphone Warehouse\u2019s offshoot Talk Talk. He is thought to be keen on the Tesco job, but to some he is too controversial a figure to chair Tesco. \u201cVery outspoken\u201d was the view of one source.</p> <p><strong>Richard Cousins</strong>, a newly appointed non-exec at Tesco, is already been cited as a candidate. Cousins is not a retailer, but is chief executive of giant caterer Compass, which employs 470,000 staff. He took that job in 2006 \u2013 when the business was in the mire \u2013 and would have to quit if the chairmanship did appeal.</p> <p><strong>John Allan</strong>, chairman of Dixons Retail at the time of its merger with Carphone Warehouse, may also get a mention. Now deputy chairman of the enlarged retailer, he is highly rated and has sat on boards including Deutsche Post and Samsonite.</p> <p>Former banker and trade minister <strong>Lord (Mervyn) Davies</strong> is not a retailer, but one of the great and good who has served on the Tesco board. He wrote a government report on getting more women into the boardroom and likes big challenges.<strong> Jill Treanor and Sarah Butler </strong></p> <p><em>This article has been amended to correct that Rickin Thakrar is an analyst at BESI Research not HSBC as the article stated.</em></p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong><br></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "It is not just the world\u2019s biggest burger chain; it is also a global emblem of American consumer capitalism. But these days the golden arches of McDonald\u2019s are looking a little tarnished. After a decade of relentless expansion, customers around the world don\u2019t seem to be lovin\u2019 it any more. Last week McDonald\u2019s revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 3.3% on last year in a set of results that went beyond Wall Street\u2019s worst nightmares and were swiftly characterised as atrocious. Problems are piling up almost everywhere. In China, sales plunged by 23% after a food scare when local media showed workers apparently caught on camera at a local supplier, Shanghai Husi Food, claiming to use out-of-date beef and chicken in products destined for McDonald\u2019s and KFC. In Europe, sales are down by 4%, mostly because of turmoil in Ukraine and the sour anti-western mood in Russia that has seen US companies caught in the political crossfire. Around 200 of McDonald\u2019s 450 restaurants in Russia are being investigated by health inspectors in apparently politically motivated food-safety checks. Ten have been closed. But it is in the US, where McDonald\u2019s has around 40% of its restaurants, where the crisis runs deepest. Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his first restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries. McDonald\u2019s has chalked up 12 straight months of declining sales in its massive home market, with sales down 4.1% in the latest quarter. Younger diners are deserting the restaurant in droves to eat out at rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill \u2013 which, just the day before McDonald\u2019s revealed its horrible sales figures, announced 20% growth in revenues. The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonald\u2019s once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011, according to food analysts Technomic, while the number of 22-to-37-year-olds visiting has not grown. To add to the company\u2019s woes, McDonald\u2019s hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American diners, who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys, Smashburger or Fuddruckers. Fast-growing US-only chain Chick-fil-A was deemed to be best for chicken. McDonald\u2019s is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals, especially Chipotle, which trumpets its antibiotic-free meat and \u201clocally sourced, seasonal produce\u201d \u2013 although local for Chipotle can mean 350 miles away. The depth of consumer mistrust of McDonald\u2019s was exposed by a consumer outreach exercise the company launched in the US earlier this month. \u201cHave you ever used pink slime in your burgers?\u201d was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website \u2013 referring to the controversial beef filler (gristle and fat) used for dog food that is sprayed down with ammonia to make it \u201cfit\u201d for human consumption. The meat product, banned in Europe since the BSE crisis, was dropped by McDonald\u2019s in 2012 after being exposed by chef Jamie Oliver. But pink slime has left doubts in US consumers\u2019 minds. \u201cDoes McDonald\u2019s beef contain worms?\u201d asked another person. (\u201cNo. Gross. End of story,\u201d replied the company). Others wanted to know whether it uses real eggs, or whether the McRib is made with the same plastic contained in yoga mats. McDonald\u2019s chief executive Don Thompson acknowledged the company had a job to do in \u201cadjusting misperceptions about the freshness, quality and integrity of our ingredients\u201d. Yet, just as McDonald\u2019s has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food perceived as fresher and healthier, it has also lost its edge in fast food essentials: speedy service at low prices. Ever since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals, while many consumers complain that service is slower. The \u201cexpensive\u201d tag was unjustified, said Mary Chapman at Technomic. \u201cPrices have indeed gone up, but they haven\u2019t gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-service chains in the US.\u201d Prices at McDonald\u2019s have increased by 4.8% since 2009, well below the \u201cquick service\u201d sector average (up 19.4%), while the cost of \u201cfast casual\u201d eating, a category that includes the much-hyped Chipotle, is up 16.9% according to Technomic\u2019s menu monitor. US consumer prices rose 11% over the same period. But critics have a point when it comes to longer queues. McDonald\u2019s has a bigger menu than some, with more complicated items \u2013 its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make. \u201cI think it is worth [waiting], but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not,\u201d said Chapman. McDonald\u2019s has been here before. The company was in the doldrums in the late 1990s, beset by similar concerns about quality and service at a time when the golden arches were a lightning rod for anger about western capitalism. The mood was exemplified by demonstrators who trashed a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Seattle in 1999 to protest against the World Trade Organisation. \u201cThey have a historical record of being able to come back when times get tough,\u201d said Chapman. In the UK, McDonald\u2019s has turned around its business, making Britain a rare bright spot for the company. \u201cPeople are a bit sniffy about the brand, but it delivers,\u201d said Peter Martin of consultancy CGA Peach, whose figures show that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonald\u2019s restaurant at least once in the last six months. \u201cIt is easily the number one choice for couples with kids. It is still working, without a doubt.\u201d A competitive breakfast menu, improved coffee and free Wi-fi had given McDonald\u2019s a broad appeal in the UK, said Martin. \u201cThere is a utilitarianism and functionality about it; it ticks a lot of boxes.\u201d He points out that the UK has been a testbed for the company\u2019s social media campaigns and a brand identity that emphasises quality. In the UK, McDonald\u2019s bases its advertising on provenance \u2013 playing up its 100% \u201cBritish beef\u201d burgers and fish that has a sustainability stamp of approval from the Marine Stewardship Council. Meanwhile in the US, its annual sales still outstrip Chipotle and all similar \u201cfast-casual\u201d dining restaurants put together, according to Technomic. \u201c[McDonald\u2019s] are head and shoulders the leader,\u201d said Chapman. Executives are vowing to tackle \u201cmisperceptions\u201d about its food in its home market. Thompson has promised more organic food and custom-made burgers, in an effort to lure back American millennials. But to cut down queues he also wants to introduce simpler menus. Analysts are scratching their heads about how the company can square the circle of pared-down menus and greater choice over fillings. \u201cThey want to simplify the menu, but enhance its ability to customise, and that sounds like a very tricky wire act to pull off,\u201d said Mark Kalinowski at Janney Capital Markets. Only four out of McDonald\u2019s 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested \u201cbuild your own burger\u201d, he said, raising questions about how it could be scaled up. \u201cRight now we are sceptical; we would like to see more detail.\u201d Meanwhile, despite the declining sales, the chain continues to expand globally: by the end of the year it expects to have opened 1,400 new restaurants. Kalinowski expects McDonald\u2019s market share will continue to shrink, but he too warned against writing off the company. \u201cYou can never really count McDonald\u2019s out\u2026 We think it will be number one in terms of total sales for not just years, but decades to come.\u201d",

After a decade of relentless expansion, customers around the world don\u2019t seem to be lovin\u2019 it any more.</p> <p>Last week McDonald\u2019s revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 3.3% on last year in a set of results that went beyond Wall Street\u2019s worst nightmares and were swiftly characterised as atrocious.</p> <p>Problems are piling up almost everywhere. In China, sales plunged by 23% after a food scare when local media showed workers apparently caught on camera at a local supplier, Shanghai Husi Food, claiming to use out-of-date beef and chicken in products destined for McDonald\u2019s and KFC.</p> <p>In Europe, sales are down by 4%, mostly because of turmoil in Ukraine and the sour anti-western mood in Russia that has seen US companies caught in the political crossfire. Around 200 of McDonald\u2019s 450 restaurants in Russia are being investigated by health inspectors in apparently politically motivated food-safety checks. Ten have been closed.</p> <p>But it is in the US, where McDonald\u2019s has around 40% of its restaurants, where the crisis runs deepest. Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his first restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"12ac3c51d1f95ca864faa80120f00e6456e5d76e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414173505148/a8cebf8f-cea8-4a1e-9208-28621fa65bd6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The first McDonald's franchise, which opened on April 15, 1955, and is now a museum in Des Plaines, Illinois.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first McDonald\u2019s franchise, which opened on April 15, 1955, and is now a museum in Des Plaines, Illinois.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nam Y Huh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McDonald\u2019s has chalked up 12 straight months of declining sales in its massive home market, with sales down 4.1% in the latest quarter. Younger diners are deserting the restaurant in droves to eat out at rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill \u2013 which, just the day before McDonald\u2019s revealed its horrible sales figures, announced 20% growth in revenues. The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonald\u2019s once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011, according to food analysts Technomic, while the number of 22-to-37-year-olds visiting has not grown.</p> <p>To add to the company\u2019s woes, <a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/08/best-and-worst-fast-food-restaurants-in-america/index.htm\" title=\"\">McDonald\u2019s hamburgers were recently named the worst in America</a> in a poll of more than 32,000 American diners, who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys, Smashburger or Fuddruckers.</p> <p>Fast-growing US-only chain Chick-fil-A was deemed to be best for chicken. McDonald\u2019s is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals, especially Chipotle, which trumpets its antibiotic-free meat and \u201clocally sourced, seasonal produce\u201d \u2013 although local for Chipotle can mean 350 miles away.</p> <p>The depth of consumer mistrust of McDonald\u2019s was exposed by a consumer outreach exercise the company launched in the US earlier this month. \u201cHave you ever used pink slime in your burgers?\u201d was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website \u2013 referring to the controversial beef filler (gristle and fat) used for dog food that is sprayed down with ammonia to make it \u201cfit\u201d for human consumption. The meat product, banned in Europe since the BSE crisis, was <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/02/01/mcdonalds-announces-end-to-pink-slime-in-burgers/\" title=\"\">dropped by McDonald\u2019s in 2012</a> after being exposed by chef Jamie Oliver.</p> <p>But pink slime has left doubts in US consumers\u2019 minds. \u201cDoes McDonald\u2019s beef contain worms?\u201d asked another person. (\u201cNo. Gross. End of story,\u201d replied the company). Others wanted to know whether it uses real eggs, or whether the McRib is made with the same plastic contained in yoga mats.</p> <p>McDonald\u2019s chief executive Don Thompson acknowledged the company had a job to do in \u201cadjusting misperceptions about the freshness, quality and integrity of our ingredients\u201d.</p> <p>Yet, just as McDonald\u2019s has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food perceived as fresher and healthier, it has also lost its edge in fast food essentials: speedy service at low prices. Ever since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals, while many consumers complain that service is slower.</p> <p>The \u201cexpensive\u201d tag was unjustified, said Mary Chapman at Technomic. \u201cPrices have indeed gone up, but they haven\u2019t gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-service chains in the US.\u201d Prices at McDonald\u2019s have increased by 4.8% since 2009, well below the \u201cquick service\u201d sector average (up 19.4%), while the cost of \u201cfast casual\u201d eating, a category that includes the much-hyped Chipotle, is up 16.9% according to Technomic\u2019s menu monitor. US consumer prices rose 11% over the same period.</p> <p>But critics have a point when it comes to longer queues. McDonald\u2019s has a bigger menu than some, with more complicated items \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-03/why-the-mcwrap-is-so-important-to-mcdonalds\" title=\"\">its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make</a>. \u201cI think it is worth [waiting], but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not,\u201d said Chapman.</p> <p>McDonald\u2019s has been here before. The company was in the doldrums in the late 1990s, beset by similar concerns about quality and service at a time when the golden arches were a lightning rod for anger about western capitalism. The mood was exemplified by demonstrators who trashed a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Seattle in 1999 to protest against the World Trade Organisation.</p> <p>\u201cThey have a historical record of being able to come back when times get tough,\u201d said Chapman.</p> <p>In the UK, McDonald\u2019s has turned around its business, making Britain a rare bright spot for the company. \u201cPeople are a bit sniffy about the brand, but it delivers,\u201d said Peter Martin of consultancy CGA Peach, whose figures show that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonald\u2019s restaurant at least once in the last six months. \u201cIt is easily the number one choice for couples with kids. It is still working, without a doubt.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb6d295967764580d7267027f2e152c2898f9856\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414173725394/6b60b029-e39a-490c-8747-95ed92186d9f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The day before McDonald\u2019s unveiled its latest set of poor results, rival food chain Chipotle announced 20% growth in revenues.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A competitive breakfast menu, improved coffee and free Wi-fi had given McDonald\u2019s a broad appeal in the UK, said Martin. \u201cThere is a utilitarianism and functionality about it; it ticks a lot of boxes.\u201d He points out that the UK has been a testbed for the company\u2019s social media campaigns and a brand identity that emphasises quality. In the UK, McDonald\u2019s bases its advertising on provenance \u2013 playing up its 100% \u201cBritish beef\u201d burgers and fish that has a sustainability stamp of approval from the Marine Stewardship Council.</p> <p>Meanwhile in the US, its annual sales still outstrip Chipotle and all similar \u201cfast-casual\u201d dining restaurants put together, according to Technomic.</p> <p>\u201c[McDonald\u2019s] are head and shoulders the leader,\u201d said Chapman.</p> <p>Executives are vowing to tackle \u201cmisperceptions\u201d about its food in its home market. Thompson has promised more organic food and custom-made burgers, in an effort to lure back American millennials. But to cut down queues he also wants to introduce simpler menus. Analysts are scratching their heads about how the company can square the circle of pared-down menus and greater choice over fillings.</p> <p>\u201cThey want to simplify the menu, but enhance its ability to customise, and that sounds like a very tricky wire act to pull off,\u201d said Mark Kalinowski at Janney Capital Markets. Only four out of McDonald\u2019s 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested \u201cbuild your own burger\u201d, he said, raising questions about how it could be scaled up. \u201cRight now we are sceptical; we would like to see more detail.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, despite the declining sales, the chain continues to expand globally: by the end of the year it expects to have opened 1,400 new restaurants.</p> <p>Kalinowski expects McDonald\u2019s market share will continue to shrink, but he too warned against writing off the company. \u201cYou can never really count McDonald\u2019s out\u2026 We think it will be number one in terms of total sales for not just years, but decades to come.\u201d</p>",
