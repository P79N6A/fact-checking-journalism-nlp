      "bodyText": "This week the latest IMF World Economic Outlook was released. Once again the news was less than stellar with growth projections downgraded across the board. While the IMF generally sees good foundations for growth in Australia in the years ahead it also sees risks from a slowing China and an overheated housing market. Significantly, it has suggestions for economic policy on taxation and infrastructure that are right in the current political frame. As a general rule, the IMF outlooks don\u2019t have too much to do with Australia. Our economy, while large, is generally on the fringe of issues the IMF cares about in a global sense. But the latest outlook, titled Adjusting to Lower Commodity Prices, has Australia positioned right in the middle. The picture the IMF gives of the year ahead does not provide much joy for those hoping for a return to the good times. The first lines of the executive summary can hardly be accused of burying the lead: \u201cGlobal growth for 2015 is projected at 3.1%, 0.3 percentage point lower than in 2014, and 0.2 percentage point below the forecasts in the July 2015 World Economic Outlook update.\u201d In the previous IMF outlooks in July and April, there was generally a more optimistic outlook with few growth downgrades and even some upgrades. And following many years of gloom after the GFC there was a sense that maybe things were settling down a little. And yet when we look at the projections for growth next year, the latest view of the IMF has them at their most pessimistic. When the IMF first projected world economic growth for 2016 back in September 2011, it predicted 4.9% growth. By October 2013 it was expecting to see 4.1% growth. Now it expects 2016 will see just 3.6% economic growth across the world: The main reason for the most recent downgrade is a poorer expectation for growth in the advanced economies. The euro area, as well as the UK and USA, have all seen their growth projections for 2016 downgraded. While growth for 2016 in the emerging Asian economies (which includes China, India and Indonesia) was not downgraded, that is in part because the negative outlook there has long been set in. Back in September 2011 when the outlook was much rosier, the IMF predicted the emerging Asian economies would see growth of 8.6% in 2016, whereas now it foresees just 6.4%. For Australia, the pessimism is similar to other developed economies. Growth in 2016 is expected to be higher than it has been in 2014 and 2015, but it is now expected to be lower than was previously hoped: The IMF\u2019s projection for Australia\u2019s economy to grow by 2.9% in 2016 is the equal weakest projection it has made. Similarly, the projection for the USA\u2019s economy to grow by 2.8% next year is well below previous estimates. While there will inevitably be further revisions next April and October, it does rather give a pause to any great projections of optimism. The forecasts also display the view that growth \u2013 even if it is to be better than recent years \u2013 is not expected to return to that seen in the 1990s and early 2000s: The IMF predicts Australian GDP growth in 2020 of just 2.8% \u2013 a good deal below our 30 years average of 3.1%: Similarly, while from 1995 to 2007 the UK\u2019s economy grew each year by at least 2.5%, in 2020 the IMF predicts growth of just 2.1%. The IMF sees risks for Australia mostly coming from a \u201chard landing\u201d in China, as it notes unsurprisingly that \u201can unexpectedly sharp fall in iron ore prices could reduce prices below production costs, and further dent incomes and growth\u201d. But it is the decline in income growth that the IMF give most of its focus. As noted previously, falling export prices have whacked our national income growth and the IMF recommends a number of measures designed to counter this slowdown. As ever, the use of \u201creform\u201d gets a workout, although even when calling for a broadening of the GST it notes there will be a need for \u201cat least fully compensating those on lower incomes.\u201d Such compensation would limit the impact an increased GST would have on reducing the deficit. But pointedly the IMF is rather unconcerned about this. It also suggests that increasing public investment in infrastructure should be \u201cfinanced by borrowing\u201d. This, it argues, would reduce \u201cthe pace of deficit reduction,\u201d would support demand in the economy, \u201ctake the pressure off monetary policy, and insure against downside growth risks\u201d. The IMF suggests such investment would also help fill the gap of private investment left by the end of the mining boom, provide an incentive for private investment, boost productivity, as well as possibly help ease \u201chousing supply bottlenecks,\u201d and would take advantage of \u201crecord low interest rates\u201d (something I\u2019ve been calling for some time now). The IMF also has concerns with our housing market. While not explicitly suggesting a fall in house prices is imminent, it does note that housing prices are out of whack with the underlying fundamentals of our economy. It argues that governments should reduce \u201cincentives for potentially excessive financial investment in housing\u201d \u2013 such as the concessional treatment of capital gains tax in real estate, the exemption of owner-occupied housing for the calculation of the age pension and negative gearing. The new prime minister would gain some comfort from his decision to put changes to superannuation taxation concessions back on the table, for the IMF suggests \u201cthe system is complex and disproportionately benefits higher-income earners\u201d and should be changed. He would be less enamoured by their take on changes to workplace relations. The IMF rather interestingly notes that \u201cwhile business perceptions of Australia\u2019s relative labour market efficiency score it below the average for Anglo-countries, OECD measures of regulatory stringency show Australia is relatively less stringent compared to other countries.\u201d But the IMF realises that for some businesses and business groups ignorant perceptions trump reality, and thus it hopes the current review of workplace relations by the Productivity Commission \u201cmay help improve perceptions\u201d. All up, the prescription of increasing the GST, increasing debt (or at least slowing the path back to surplus), changing housing and superannuation taxation rules and some small changes to workplace relations have enough political sweetness and poison to please and annoy everyone. It makes for a tough sell for Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison. Yet more difficult is the IMF acknowledgement that even if these measures were to occur, given the weaker projections of terms of trade over the next few years, \u201cachieving 2% growth in per capita disposable income in the medium term\u201d would require a productivity growth \u201cnot consistently observed in Australia\u2019s past\u201d. The IMF sees risks ahead for Australia, but also chances to improve the situation if the government is prepared to argue for things either politically fraught (such as the GST) or inconsistent with their previous positions (such as paying for infrastructure with debt). But above all the IMF tells of a future where \u201cadjusting to lower commodity prices\u201d is something we will not be able to avoid.",

    "webTitle": "Is BT's Openreach open enough? It's a good question", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "You\u2019re now too late to lobby Ofcom on the troubled question of whether BT should be forced to say goodbye to Openreach, the bit that owns and manages the copper and fibre network. The deadline for submissions passed on Thursday night, and the regulator\u2019s first thoughts on this question and much else besides are promised early in the new year. Good luck with that deadline, Sharon White, Ofcom boss: the lobbying frenzy over the past few months suggests this inquiry will set a record for submissions and evidence. In the telecoms world, they talk of little else. Quite rightly, of course: the quality of broadband services in the UK is plainly an issue that matters to the health of the economy. At heart, Ofcom must answer a simple question: would Openreach invest more in broadband infrastructure, and improve its service, if it wasn\u2019t owned by BT, its biggest retail customer? At first glance, the idea is entirely reasonable. The likes of Sky and TalkTalk, running their broadband services over BT\u2019s wires, complain of bad service and appalling numbers of missed appointments for customers. As for investment, they argue BT will never be truly ambitious on fast fibre because it has an incentive to sweat the old copper assets. An independent Openreach would answer to many customers, continues the argument. And its new shareholders wouldn\u2019t be distracted by Champions League football, or \u00a312bn purchases of EE. Instead, they would get on with the job of investing in new infrastructure. It\u2019s an appealing vision. But here\u2019s the problem. Can we really be confident that a liberated Openreach would do better? BT\u2019s performance may often be poor (dismal, many in rural areas would say), but even Ofcom-endorsed studies say its overall statistics on broadband price and speed compare well against France, Germany, Spain and Italy. \u201cAs a standalone FTSE 100 company, Openreach would be highly attractive to long-term investors and able to raise fresh capital to invest on the back of future growth from the whole industry,\u201d argues Sky. Well, it might be \u201cable\u201d to do those nice things. But would it? It seems equally possible \u2013 if nothing else changes \u2013 that a liberated Openreach would be inclined to milk the current assets in the knowledge that its only national competitor is Virgin Media. That\u2019s the challenge for White. If she can create robust incentives to invigorate Openreach in independent form, then, yes, let\u2019s get radical and break up BT; it\u2019s a big beast and would cope. But if she can\u2019t guarantee that independence means improvement, then re-engineer the current regulatory system. She could start by ensuring that fines for poor service actually hurt, including in the boardroom. Small beer for SABMiller Twenty four hours after Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev chief executive, called for SABMiller\u2019s shareholders to rise in rebellion against their directors, little has happened. Fund managers have not popped up in the usual places to do Brito\u2019s bidding. There seems to be general satisfaction that SAB chairman Jan du Plessis made a correct call when he dismissed AB InBev\u2019s \u00a365bn offer as a \u201cvery substantial undervaluation\u201d. There is still time for a whispering campaign to develop, of course. But Brito did himself few favours with his presentation of the bid. He comes across as a man who expects every asset to be for sale at a price he dictates, and rages against an SAB board he thinks is \u201cfrustrating the process\u201d. In fact, SAB\u2019s board is doing what it is supposed to do: offering an opinion on what it thinks the company is worth, and what it is capable of achieving. There is no obligation to \u201cengage\u201d until there is a reasonable proposal on the table \u2013 and Brito is about 10% short. Uphill challenge for challenger banks The make-up of the UK banking industry, you will have noticed, was not transformed by the 2008 crisis. The big boys remain entrenched and the rise of the \u201cchallenger\u201d banks remains a work in progress, despite George Osborne\u2019s oft-repeated claim that he wants the upstarts to upset the old oligopoly. The chancellor\u2019s words, though, haven\u2019t matched his actions. In his summer budget he transformed the taxation of banks to replace the old bank levy \u2013 a charge on the size of a bank\u2019s global balance sheet \u2013 with a corporation tax surcharge. The net effect: the likes of HSBC and Barclays will pay less and the challengers will pay more. Unfair? Well, Osborne won\u2019t be bounced into a U-turn; HSBC\u2019s threat to move to Hong Kong has worked its dubious magic. But the impact on competition can\u2019t be ignored. The Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority is duty-bound these days to promote effective competition in banking. Does it think the corporation tax surcharge is a setback for the competitiveness of challengers? If so, should the newcomers, obliged to hold more capital than established rivals, be allowed to hold less? Well done Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, for demanding a few answers from the PRA. Without a prod, one suspects regulators would pretend nothing has happened.",

The likes of Sky and TalkTalk, running their broadband services over BT\u2019s wires, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/19/ofcom-peformance-targets-bt-openreach\">complain of bad service and appalling numbers of missed appointments for customers.</a> As for investment, they argue BT will never be truly ambitious on fast fibre because it has an incentive to sweat the old copper assets.</p> <p>An independent Openreach would answer to many customers, continues the argument. And its new shareholders wouldn\u2019t be distracted by Champions League football, or \u00a312bn purchases of EE. Instead, they would get on with the job of investing in new infrastructure.</p> <p>It\u2019s an appealing vision. But here\u2019s the problem. Can we really be confident that a liberated Openreach would do better? BT\u2019s performance may often be poor (dismal, many in rural areas would say), but even Ofcom-endorsed studies say its overall statistics on broadband price and speed compare well against France, Germany, Spain and Italy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/09/bank-england-probe-george-osborne-new-bank-tax\">Bank of England to probe George Osborne's new bank tax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAs a standalone FTSE 100 company, Openreach would be highly attractive to long-term investors and able to raise fresh capital to invest on the back of future growth from the whole industry,\u201d argues Sky.</p> <p>Well, it might be \u201cable\u201d to do those nice things. But would it? It seems equally possible \u2013 if nothing else changes \u2013 that a liberated Openreach would be inclined to milk the current assets in the knowledge that its only national competitor is Virgin Media.</p> <p>That\u2019s the challenge for White. If she can create robust incentives to invigorate Openreach in independent form, then, yes, let\u2019s get radical and break up BT; it\u2019s a big beast and would cope.</p> <p>But if she can\u2019t guarantee that independence means improvement, then re-engineer the current regulatory system. She could start by ensuring that fines for poor service actually hurt, including in the boardroom.</p> <h2>Small beer for SABMiller</h2> <p>Twenty four hours after Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev chief executive, called for SABMiller\u2019s shareholders to rise in rebellion against their directors, little has happened. Fund managers have not popped up in the usual places to do Brito\u2019s bidding. There seems to be general satisfaction that SAB chairman Jan du Plessis made a correct call when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/oct/07/ab-inbev-sabmiller-santo-domingo-takeover-offer\">he dismissed AB InBev\u2019s \u00a365bn offer as a \u201cvery substantial undervaluation\u201d</a>.<br></p> <p>There is still time for a whispering campaign to develop, of course. But Brito did himself few favours with his presentation of the bid. He comes across as a man who expects every asset to be for sale at a price he dictates, and rages against an SAB board he thinks is \u201cfrustrating the process\u201d.</p> <p>In fact, SAB\u2019s board is doing what it is supposed to do: offering an opinion on what it thinks the company is worth, and what it is capable of achieving. There is no obligation to \u201cengage\u201d until there is a reasonable proposal on the table \u2013 and Brito is about 10% short.</p> <h2>Uphill challenge for challenger banks</h2> <p>The make-up of the UK banking industry, you will have noticed, was not transformed by the 2008 crisis. The big boys remain entrenched and the rise of the \u201cchallenger\u201d banks remains a work in progress, despite George Osborne\u2019s oft-repeated claim that he wants the upstarts to upset the old oligopoly.</p> <p>The chancellor\u2019s words, though, haven\u2019t matched his actions. In his summer budget he transformed the taxation of banks to replace the old bank levy \u2013 a charge on the size of a bank\u2019s global balance sheet \u2013 with a corporation tax surcharge. The net effect: the likes of HSBC and Barclays will pay less and the challengers will pay more.</p> <p>Unfair? Well, Osborne won\u2019t be bounced into a U-turn; HSBC\u2019s threat to move to Hong Kong has worked its dubious magic. But the impact on competition can\u2019t be ignored. The Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority is duty-bound these days to promote effective competition in banking. Does it think the corporation tax surcharge is a setback for the competitiveness of challengers? If so, should the newcomers, obliged to hold more capital than established rivals, be allowed to hold less?</p> <p>Well done Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, for demanding a few answers from the PRA. Without a prod, one suspects regulators would pretend nothing has happened.</p>",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s new tax on banks is facing fresh scrutiny from the Bank of England after MPs urged Threadneedle Street to consider the implications for competition in the sector. Banks such as Metro and Secure Trust \u2013 which are trying to take on the \u201cbig four\u201d on the high street \u2013 have been arguing that the tax puts newcomers at a disadvantage. In July, the chancellor announced that the Treasury will impose an extra 8% of corporation tax on banks making profits of more than \u00a325m from next year, in a move that will also hit the balance sheets of smaller players. The Treasury select committee is now asking Andrew Bailey, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, if that 8% surcharge has implications for competition in a sector dominated by Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays. Bailey, who runs the Bank\u2019s regulation arm \u2013 the Prudential Regulation Authority \u2013 is also being asked to consider capital rules which have also prompted protests from smaller banks. The intervention of the select committee, chaired by the Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, comes just weeks before the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is due to publish preliminary findings on its investigation into personal current accounts and banking for small businesses which was launched in July 2014. Tyrie has already urged the CMA to consider the implications of the tax as part of its investigation. Tyrie MP said: \u201cMillions of consumers and small businesses have been getting a poor deal for decades because of inadequate competition and choice in banking. It is crucial that competition from new and smaller banks is not unnecessarily impeded by prudential regulation. \u201cIt is essential that the surcharge does not obstruct Parliament\u2019s efforts over the last four years to increase competition in the banking sector. The committee will want an assurance from the PRA that it has assessed its effect on competition in the retail sector.\u201d The 8% corporation tax surcharge is being introduced alongside changes to the bank levy, which is based on the size of bank balance sheets rather than their profits. The scale of the bank levy is being reduced under the new system. The changes are said to benefit large international banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered because they paid the levy on the whole of the balance sheet while challenger banks were not big enough to be captured by the levy. The change to the levy came after complaints from HSBC whose chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said in May that the \u00a3700m it paid towards the bank levy was impeding his efforts to bolster returns to shareholders. The bank is currently considering whether to remain headquartered in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "Dozens of consumer privacy groups are calling for a US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation into the data breach at credit agency and data broker Experian, saying that intrusions into other parts of the company\u2019s data \u201cwould be a terrifying and unmitigated disaster\u201d. In a letter from the US Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) co-signed by 25 different data security and consumer advocacy organizations, the groups publicly questioned Experian\u2019s assertion that its consumer credit database of 200 million people was safe from thieves. Experian has said that the hack was at a subsidiary, identified by the company as Decisioning Solutions, which it acquired in 2013. At least five different groups of litigants are currently seeking class-action status; some are against Experian and some are against T-Mobile. Among the organizations endorsing an investigation are Consumer Watchdog, the Center for Digital Democracy, the World Privacy Forum and the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \u201cWe believe that it is incumbent on the regulatory agencies to fully investigate this breach, including whether other Experian databases have been breached,\u201d wrote the signatories. \u201cAs you know, Experian is one of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies (CRAs), each holding data on over 200 million consumers. A data security breach that affected Experian\u2019s credit report files would be a terrifying and unmitigated disaster.\u201d The call comes as details are emerging about what former contractors characterize as a lax approach to security implementation at Experian, especially at companies it acquires. The data giant spends liberally on security, many say, but less so on implementation. Brian Krebs, a security researcher, interviewed several former Experian contractors, who told him that the high security standards held at the board level were not a part of its daily operations. \u201cWhat the board of directors at Experian wanted security-wise and the security capabilities on the ground were two completely different things,\u201d one contractor, Jasun Tate, told Krebs. The company had a mandate to grow by acquiring other businesses with proprietary data sets, Krebs writes, but when it came to securing that data at Experian after an acquisition, Tate said that \u201cthe subsequent integration of the business into our core security architecture was just a black box of magic in terms of how it was to be implemented. And I\u2019m not saying successful magic at all.\u201d The company has been breached before, also at a company it had acquired recently, and is currently battling a class-action suit alleging misconduct. In that case, the data wasn\u2019t stolen, it was simply sold by Experian subsidiary CourtVentures to Hieu Minh Ngo, a 25-year-old Vietnamese man posing as a Singaporean private detective but actually selling data on to identity thieves. Now exactly what Experian does to safeguard that information \u2013 and how it differs from the company\u2019s credit report databases \u2013 is under the microscope. \u201cWhat are the differences in security measures that would allow hackers to access the information of T-Mobile customers but not the main credit report files?\u201d asked the PIRG letter. \u201cIf there are differences, why weren\u2019t the security measures used for the T-Mobile server? If there are no such differences, doesn\u2019t this raise the troubling possibility that the servers holding highly sensitive credit and personal information of over 200 million Americans is vulnerable to a data hack by identity thieves?\u201d An Experian spokesman said: \u201cExperian understands the concerns raised and we are prepared to respond promptly to requests from regulatory agencies for more details about the incident. Security is a top priority for the company, and Experian is committed to continuous investments in upgrading talent, processes, and technologies needed to protect our systems.

      "bodyText": "Millions of young people continue to struggle to find work with global youth unemployment set to rise further above its pre-downturn level, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has warned. The UN agency is calling on governments to invest more in education and training as new evidence emerges that young jobseekers are being disproportionately hurt by the legacy of the global financial crisis. The ILO\u2019s annual report into youth employment trends found that although the global jobless rate for young people fell between 2012 and 2014, at 13% it was still three times higher than the rate for the over-25s. It is also well above the 11.7% rate before the crisis and projected to edge up to 13.1% in 2015. The authors said there were some \u201cencouraging\u201d improvements on the previous year and they also noted that the rising jobless rate was partly a factor of a shrinking youth workforce as enrolment in education rises. But, adding to fears for struggling emerging economies, they warned the upturn was patchy. The report signalled a divide between developed economies where the jobless rate has fallen since 2012 and countries in Asia and North Africa where it rose or stagnated. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that recovery is not universal and that almost 43% of the global youth labour force is still either unemployed or working yet living in poverty,\u201d said Sara Elder, the report\u2019s lead author. \u201cIt\u2019s still not easy to be young and starting out in today\u2019s labour market.\u201d Rising unemployment in Asia The findings on rising youth unemployment in east Asia, south-east Asia, the Middle East and North Africa follow warnings that as the global economy loses momentum, emerging nations are most vulnerable. The International Monetary Fund has warned rising interest rates in advanced economies such as the US could exacerbate the problems by sparking a new credit crunch in emerging markets. In the EU, the picture was brighter and the youth unemployment rate there had fallen, according to the ILO\u2019s global employment trends for youth 2015 report. But although more young people in developed economies were now finding work the the quality of jobs is below their expectations. \u201cAnd still too many remain stuck in long-term unemployment. In the European Union, more than one in three unemployed youth has been looking for work for more than one year,\u201d the ILO points out. Youth unemployment level falls but rate rises The report noted the \u201cstubbornly high\u201d youth unemployment rate was partly down to a shrinking youth labour force as more young people enrol in education. The number of unemployed people aged 15 to 24 had actually fallen to 73.3 million in 2014, down from the crisis peak of 76.6 million in 2009. But while it welcomed rising education take-up, again the organisation raised concerns about the uneven pattern around the world. In low-income countries, 31% of young people had no educational qualifications at all, compared with 6% in lower middle-income countries and 2% in upper middle-income countries, the report found. Young people also faced higher unemployment than older workers. \u201cThe youth unemployment rate has been consistently close to three times that of the adult unemployment rate since 1995,\u201d the report said. The ratio was 2.9 in 2014. The ILO wants to see more help into work and better social safety nets for young people looking for jobs in a labour market that is being rapidly changed by technology and new types of employer, including start-ups. \u201cIncreased investment is needed to alleviate the scars of the crisis on the present generation as well as to ensure more inclusive labour markets and societies,\u201d said Azita Berar Awad, director of the ILO\u2019s employment policy department. \u201cWe know that today\u2019s youth do not face an easy labour market transition and with the continued global economic slowdown, this is likely to continue, but we also know that greater investment in targeted action to boost youth employment pays off.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Despite Volkwagen\u2019s congressional hearing lasting more than two hours and the carmaker\u2019s US boss facing almost constant criticism, Congress was only fixated on a pair of questions \u2013 who is to blame for the diesel emissions scandal and how are you going to fix it? Unfortunately for Michael Horn and VW, the energy and commerce committee in Congress was not satisfied with either answer. Horn warned it will take \u201cone to two years minimum\u201d to fix the half-a-million cars in the US fitted with a defeat device. The vast majority of these cars \u2013 430,000 \u2013 will require software and hardware repairs that could even involve a new tank being fitted to the vehicle. However, Horn admitted that the fix was still being tested and the solution was \u201ccomplex\u201d. Frank Pallone, the representative for New Jersey, refused to believe that VW\u2019s repairs would not affect the performance of the vehicle. He also urged VW to consider offering customers a full refund. However, if the committee was frustrated with Horn\u2019s explanation with VW\u2019s plan to fix the affected cars, it was nothing compared to its incredulity at his answer about who fitted the defeat devices that allowed vehicles to cheat emissions tests. Horn regurgitated the official VW answer that it was \u201cnot a corporate decision\u201d and that \u201ca couple of software engineers\u201d had put the device into the vehicles. Three people have been suspended by the company, according to Horn, whose official title is president and chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America. \u201cDo you know how that defies credulity?\u201d Michael Burgess from Texas said. Chris Collins went even further. The representative from New York said he \u201ccategorically rejects\u201d VW\u2019s version of events and the carmaker was either incompetent or guilty of a \u201cmassive cover-up\u201d. Did the company not wonder how its engineers had managed to lower the emissions on a car that was 40 times over the legal limit, he asked? If they had actually done this it would have been \u201cmassive breakthrough technology\u201d and surely VW would have looked to patent the device that did it. \u201cIt goes way, way higher than that,\u201d Collins said of the explanation that rogue engineers were to blame. Perhaps as a defensive strategy aimed at winning over the committee or perhaps because he genuinely does doubt the company\u2019s official version of events, Horn said he also struggled to believe this story. \u201cI agree too, it is very hard to believe, and personally I struggle as well,\u201d Horn said. Horn described the defeat device as a line of code \u201chidden in millions of software code\u201d, meaning it was possible it had been missed by others in VW. However, he also criticised his own company, urging VW to \u201cbloody learn and use the opportunity to get its act together\u201d. The way the carmaker manages its 600,000 staff needs to change, he added. The scandal was ultimately caused by \u201cpressure in the system to get resolutions and cost pressures\u201d, according to Horn. \u201cIt is dead wrong if you put corporate profits before people.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Dave Lewis has bought his first shares in Tesco more than a year after becoming chief executive of the ailing supermarket chain. A group of Tesco directors have bought almost \u00a3450,000 of shares in the retailer, with Lewis, who joined on October 1 2014, snapping up \u00a3200,000 worth. The Guardian reported last month that the entire board of Tesco had invested less than \u00a3350,000 in the company and that corporate governance pressure groups had criticised the lack of share purchases by Lewis and Alan Stewart, the finance director. The share purchases come a day after Lewis said the Tesco board had barred him from buying shares because he possessed too much inside information about the progress of asset sales and the Serious Fraud Office investigation into an accounting scandal at the company. \u201cWe as a board took a decision that while those things were ongoing, we would exclude ourselves from being able to trade Tesco shares,\u201d Lewis said as Tesco reported half-year results showing a 55% drop in operating profits before one-off items. \u201cWe operate under that restriction to this day because we think that is the right corporate governance to have when you are going through this sort of turnaround and have these sorts of issues.\u201d However, in what appeared an orchestrated collection of trades by the board, Lewis bought \u00a3200,000 of shares while Stewart acquired \u00a3101,200, and John Allan, the chairman, spent \u00a3100,000. Richard Cousins, the senior independent director, bought \u00a335,540 of shares, and non-executive director Mikael Ohlsson bought \u00a310,500. A Tesco spokesman said the share dealings \u201cfollowed the publication of our interim results and the conclusion of our portfolio review\u201d. Lewis confirmed in Tesco\u2019s interim results that the company does not plan to sell more assets after offloading its South Korean chain, Homeplus, for \u00a34bn. Despite the share purchases, the investment by Tesco\u2019s board pales in comparison with its rivals. David Potts, the boss of Morrisons, spent more than \u00a31m buying 508,000 shares during his first week in charge in March. Tesco\u2019s official policy is that Lewis must hold four times his base salary of \u00a31.25m in shares while Stewart must hold three times his \u00a3750,000 salary. However, the directors have five years from joining Tesco to reach this target and the company includes shares given to Lewis and Stewart as part of their remuneration package. Tesco shares rose 2% to 200.95p on Thursday. However, they have fallen by almost a fifth since the day Lewis began as chief executive.",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen\u2019s US boss on Thursday said he felt personally deceived by the emissions rigging scandal that has engulfed the carmaker and admitted he found it \u201chard to believe\u201d that just two rogue engineers were at the root of the furore. Michael Horn told a congressional hearing in Washington that it was wrong for companies to put profits before people. His appearance came just hours after police raided Volkswagen\u2019s headquarters in Germany on Thursday as part of their investigation into the scandal. At times Horn struggled to maintain his composure and told lawmakers he was unable to sleep at night following revelations that 11m diesel VW vehicles worldwide have been fitted with a defeat device designed to cheat emissions tests. \u201cI have worked for 25 years for this company,\u201d said the German-born executive. \u201cIntegrity, quality and not cheating was always for me a given for this company,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep at night.\u201d At first Horn kept to the VW line that two rogue software engineers were responsible for the deception, but under tough questioning by members of the House committee on energy and commerce he admitted that he too found it difficult to believe. Chris Collins, a representative from New York, told Horn that he \u201ccategorically\u201d rejected the idea that lowly software engineers were solely responsible and that VW was either incompetent or involved in a \u201cmassive cover-up\u201d. \u201cI agree it\u2019s very hard to believe,\u201d said Horn. \u201cPersonally I struggle as well.\u201d The company faces fines of up to $18bn (\u00a311.7bn) from US regulators and a rash of lawsuits from angry customers as well as investigations from regulators across the world. Horn said the scandal would cost VW \u201ca whole lot of money\u201d. The company has set aside \u00a36.5bn ($10bn). \u201cMaybe this is enough. Maybe this is not enough. I don\u2019t know,\u201d Horn said. Horn said that he personally was unaware of the emissions rigging software despite hearing about issues with emissions compliance as early as spring 2014. \u201cLet me be very clear about this: while I was told about the EPA [US Environmental Protection Agency] process, I was not then told, nor did I have any reason to suspect, that our vehicles included such a device,\u201d Horn said. In the spring of 2014 a West Virginia University research team found higher nitrogen oxide emissions in two Volkswagen cars. \u201cAt that time, I had no understanding of what a defeat device was,\u201d Horn said. A Guardian analysis suggests that rigging the emissions tests means VW may be responsible for adding nearly 1m tonnes of air pollution every year. The affected cars were pumping out 40 times the amounts of pollution allowed under the US\u2019s clean air act. Under the terms of act the Justice Department could impose fines of as much as $37,500 (\u00a324,545) for each recalled vehicle, a possible total penalty of $18bn (\u00a311.7bn) before any other fines and close to the record $20bn (\u00a313bn) that BP was fined for the Deepwater Horizon disaster. \u201cWe\u2019re here because Volkswagen lied,\u201d said New Jersey representative Frank Pallone. Following on from hearings into scandals at GM, Toyota and air bag manufacturer Takata, Pallone said the latest hearing made him wonder \u201chow much we should trust the auto industry in general\u201d. \u201cThis seems to be a pervasive culture of deception in the auto industry and it needs to stop now,\u201d he said. Horn reiterated that all the affected cars were safe to drive and said the automaker would fix the US diesel cars involved in the scandal. Underlining the uphill task to winning back confidence, Congressman Peter Welch said: \u201cVW is the Lance Armstrong of the auto industry\u201d - a reference to the US cyclist who was stripped of seven consecutive Tour de France titles after he was caught doping. Meanwhile, raids at Volkwagen\u2019s Wolfsburg base in Germanywere aimed at finding documents that could identify VW staff involved in manipulating diesel emissions tests, said prosecutors in Lower Saxony. The German prosecutors said: \u201cToday, in connection with the so-called emissions scandal, raids were carried out at Volkswagen in Wolfsburg and other locations. The raids aimed to secure documents and data carriers that, in view of possible offences, can provide information about the exact conduct of company employees and their identities in the manipulation of exhaust emissions of diesel vehicles.\u201d Sigmar Gabriel, the vice-chancellor of Germany and also the economy minister, also visited Wolfsburg on Thursday to address staff. \u201cI think it is important to send the message that, in the end, the employees must not pay the price for criminal behaviour by managers,\u201d he told workers.",

      "bodyText": "There has been much debate about whether the US Federal Reserve should raise interest rates this year, but one Fed banker believes it should consider a cut instead. Minneapolis Fed president Narayana Kocherlakota has said in a speech that low inflation gave the bank a huge opportunity to do more to revive the jobs market, Reuters is reporting. He said: Given my current outlook, I believe that it would be appropriate to wait until 2017 to initiate liftoff and then raise the fed funds rate at about 2 percentage points per year. To best fulfill its congressional mandates, the (Federal Reserve Open Market Committee) should be considering reducing the target range for the fed funds rate, not increasing it. The full speech is here. On that note we\u2019ll call a halt, so thanks for all your comments. More from IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, courtesy Bloomberg: Markets have moved ahead again, but it is not a particularly convincing rise. More accurate, perhaps, to say they were barely changed. There were few surprises from the Bank of England and European Central Bank updates, while investors remained cautious ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve minutes. Commodity companies moved higher - Glencore being an exception on continuing debt fears - as copper regained ground as an industry group forecast a deficit next year. Oil prices climbed on supply concerns, with Brent crude currently more than 2% better at $52.49 a barrel. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.61% or 38.47 points at 6374.82 Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.27% at 9997.73 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.2% at 4676.74 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.68% at 22,156.74 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.11% better at 10,181.2 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.3% to 678.05 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 18 points or 0.11%. And the press conference is over. George Osborne this week announced measures to boost infrastructure in Britain. Is there enough fiscal space and is it a good time for Britain to be doing that? We have come out publicly and supported infrastructure spending . It is a win win for the economy. It supports growth and activity in short term, puts people to work, Improves medium to long term potential for growth, so absolutely yes. If fiscal direction imposed by government is heading to stability and inspires confidence, it\u2019s really an excellent choice. Could central banks now do more harm than good good [given policy tools are now limited]? Impossible to answer: 188 central bandks round world. Clear central banks been a forefront of fighting great recesssion, thank goodness they were around, whether Fed, ECB, Bank of Japan, Bank of England. We believe in certain regions, Europe and Japan, those monetary policies which have been helpful should continue because they have not reached their target. IMF been recommending a number of these policies for a while, but still gloomy outlook. What can you do to get policymakers to heed the call? True we have been recommending demand, financial stability and structural reforms but not always applied. Some countries have done structural reforms, some done a little, some done nothing at all On infrastructure, we have seen some but not enough. There is some hope on the call for international co-operation, when look at TTP, country commitment for COP 21 [climate conference], however gloomy there are some interesting positive developments we had not expected. Would be good if 2010 reform of IMF was ratified by US. Entering an era of longer crises [and longer IMF programmes]? A matter we need to look at. Not suggesting we should have longer term IMF programmes. Have seen difficulties with moving fast. Should look at programmes and see if they are fit for purpose. Will you pursue a second term as IMF managing director? Clearly this could be my last meeting, open to it not being but for membership to decide. China - what is your suggestion for policymakers in China, given the stock market fall and the devaluation of yuan? Slowdown of growth in China was predictable and anticipated. We believe it\u2019s a good move. To only grow at 6.8% with a growth model not based on massive exports and capital projects but domestic demand is a good transition. But it is a massive exercise and there will be bumps on the road, no transition can be made without any volatility. Here\u2019s Reuters take on Lagarde\u2019s early comments: International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde urged global policymakers on Thursday to support economic growth while also tackling financial risks stemming from the provision of easy money amid a \u201crapidly changing and uncertain world.\u201d Lagarde, presenting a Global Policy Agenda at the fund\u2019s annual meeting in Peru, said a recovery in the United States was broadly on track and a rise in U.S. interest rates \u201cis approaching\u201d and would tighten global funding conditions. But she added that the slowing of economic activity in China and recent market volatility were having larger-than-expected spillovers across the global economy. Emerging economies, which have contributed the bulk of world growth in recent years, have been hit hard by a slump in commodity prices. \u201cPolicymakers are increasingly grappling with difficult policy trade-offs,\u201d Lagarde said, calling for a careful mix of policies to support economic demand, while also tackling financial risks and reforming economies to deliver future growth. Asked about the IMF\u2019s view on Greece, Lagarde said: On Greece the position has not changed. Greece has requested support of IMF, and any programme has to walk on two legs. One: significant reforms embedded in legistlation, particularly on pension and bank governance. Two: a debt operation that renders Greek debt sustainable. First question: is the slowdown in China and emerging markets already effecting economies elsewhere, as shown by recent German data? Lagarde said the IMF is still forecasting growth at 3.1%, so recovering although decelerating, and is expected to improve in 2016. I wouldn\u2019t paint a dark picture, but insist on policy to move from deceleration to something that is stronger. Also seeing rebalancing, where emerging economies are slowing down relative to what done so far. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde is introducing the organisations annual meeting in Peru. She says policymakers should follow the example of the Peruvian cuisine - which is a mix of best practices from around the world, refining and updating traditional recipes. She says China, US monetary policy and commodities need to be managed. Policymakers must support growth, and international co-operation is more vital than ever. They must reduce risks in an uncertain world. Meanwhile as news emerges that German prosecutors have mounted raids connected with the Volkswagen emissions scandal, the US House committee on energy and commerce is about to quiz Michael Horn, VW\u2019s US president and chief executive. Our live blog on the hearing is here: US shares have opened lower ahead of the release of the latest Federal Reserve minutes. Analysts will be looking carefully for signs of concern about emerging markets and its views on inflation. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: If the minutes make it clear, like in recent speeches that Fed members do not foresee much impact from an emerging market slowdown on the US economy, that could give the minutes a more hawkish tone. Inflation or lack thereof is the main domestic justification for not rising rates so any wording change that suggests the Fed expects a slower return to the 2% target would give off a dovish vibe. The Fed meeting obviously took place before the potentially game-changing latest jobs report so could be a little stale. So after five days of gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged down 33 points or 0.2%. In Europe, the FTSE 100, Germany\u2019s Dax and the French Cac are still marginally in positive territory. December\u2019s meeting of the European Central Bank is the most likely time for the central bank to consider expanding quantitative easing, said RBC European economist Timo del Carpio after today\u2019s meeting: The ECB\u2019s account of its September monetary policy meeting reveals a rather uneasy mood within the Governing Council. A deteriorating inflation outlook, rising market volatility and renewed risks to global activity all appear to have precipitated a lively discussion last month. However, there was little by way of a conclusive judgement on the implications for policy. Given the strong emphasis on the need to monitor incoming data, we think such a judgement may also fail to materialise at the October meeting as well. Instead, we continue to look to the December gathering as the most proximate opportunity for the ECB to cement expectations that QE will continue beyond September 2016. The European Central Bank has also released the minutes of its latest meeting today. They\u2019re staler than the Bank of England\u2019s fresh offering, as the ECB\u2019s governing council met in early September. But they show that the eurozone\u2019s central bank is more concerned about emerging economies. Chief economist Peter Praet told the ECB that: \u201cChallenges facing emerging market economies were clouding the global outlook and were unlikely to recede quickly.... Although it was still premature to conclude whether these developments could have a lasting impact on euro area output and... inflation, downside risks had intensified.\u201d Enrique Diaz Alvarez, chief risk officer and currency expert at financial services firm Ebury, now believes UK interest rates will stay at record lows for longer. \u201cSurprisingly dovish minutes after an unsurprising decision to leave rates at 0.5%. Only one dissenter asked for an immediate hike, and the committee focused on the prospects for even lower inflation since its last meeting. The minutes also referenced a shortening lag between hiking rates and their impact on inflation- another hint that the Bank of England feels it can afford to wait further before raising rates.\u201d \u201cWe now push our call for a first hike from February 2016 to the second quarter of the year. This should generally be welcomed by UK businesses as it means the extraordinarily favourable environment of low rates should continue for quite a while longer.\u201d The pound has fallen around half a cent against the US dollar since the Bank of England decision was announced. Traders may be reacting to the line in the minutes about weaker inflation expectations, which suggest the Bank is less willing to raise rates soon. David Kern, chief economist of the British Chambers of Commerce, welcomed the Bank\u2019s decision to leave rates on hold. A rate hike now would threaten the recovery, he believes, especially given the problems overseas: \u201cThe UK recovery, although on course, is still fragile - it remains too reliant on consumer spending and is facing headwinds. Many major economies are experiencing difficulties that will inevitably increase the challenges for our exporters.\u201d Here\u2019s ING economist James Knightley on today\u2019s Bank of England decision: The minutes to the meeting show that the MPC remains pretty upbeat on growth prospects with the economy expected to have expanded 0.6% in 3Q15, which is around the trend rate of growth. Interestingly, they continue to downplay emerging market slowdown worries, stating that \u201cthere had so far been few signs of a material effect on business and consumer confidence in the advanced economies\u201d. Knightley believes that wage growth will be crucial in determining when the BoE will raise interest rates. If financial market risk appetite continues to improve as well then we would suspect that Ian McCafferty will not be alone in voting for a rate rise at the November MPC meeting. We continue to look for the BoE to raise rates in the first half of 2016, well ahead of the 4Q16 [fourth quarter] move financial markets are currently pricing. The Bank of England\u2019s economists predict that the UK economy grew by 0.6% in the third quarter of this year. That\u2019s a dip on the second quarter, when GDP rose by 0.7%, but not a significant drop. Yesterday, the NIESR thinktank predicted growth of 0.5% in Q3. Some instant reaction to today\u2019s Bank minutes: The words \u201cChina\u201d and \u201cChinese\u201d crop up more than 10 times in the Minutes, showing that the BoE is paying close attention to its economy. You can see the minutes online here (pdf). The Bank of England minutes show that policymakers discussed the slowdown in emerging markets, but they aren\u2019t panicking about China yet: Outside the advanced economies, a continued slowdown in emerging market growth remained evident, most notably in Brazil and Russia. Despite increased concern about growth prospects in China and the associated reduction and volatility in risky asset prices, Chinese activity indicators to date had been steady and the authorities had implemented a range of stimulatory policy initiatives. Although there remained a risk that emerging market prospects might deteriorate further, there had so far been few signs of a material effect on business and consumer confidence in the advanced economies. The Bank of England now believes that inflation will rise more slowly than it expected two months ago. Inflation is currently zero, according to the latest data. And today\u2019s minutes show that the BoE believes cheap energy costs will prevent it rising quickly. Today\u2019s minutes say: The near-term outlook for CPI inflation appeared slightly weaker than at the time of the August Inflation Report, in part reflecting the further decline in the oil price. CPI inflation was likely to remain close to zero before picking up around the turn of the year. But it now appeared likely to remain below 1% until spring 2016. And that means less pressure to raise interest rates soon. The Bank of England says there is \u201ca range of views\u201d among members of the monetary policy committee over the inflation outlook. But only one member, Ian McCafferty, wanted to raise rates at this month\u2019s meeting. Ian McCafferty preferred to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points, given his view that building domestic cost pressures were likely to come to outweigh the dampening influence of the appreciation of sterling, causing inflation to overshoot the 2% target in the medium term. The Bank adds that interest rate are expected to rise \u201cmore gradually\u201d than in the past, and to a lower level. But.... Such guidance, however, is an expectation and not a promise: the path that Bank Rate will actually follow over the next few years will depend on economic circumstances. The BoE has also left its quantitative easing programme unchanged, at \u00a3375bn. Here we go... the Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.5%, by 8 votes to 1. That means borrowing costs have been stuck at their record low since March 2009. At noon sharp, the Bank of England will announce its decision on monetary policy, and release the minutes of this week\u2019s meeting. There\u2019s no realistic chance they\u2019ll raise interest rates today. But the monetary policy committee could be split again, if Ian McCafferty continues to lobby for a hike. Jeremy Cook of World First believes rates won\u2019t be raised until next spring, or summer. He\u2019s tweeted a few thoughts: The Economist Intelligence Unit believes the German economy remains quite solid, despite the big drop in exports and imports in August: Here\u2019s their reasoning: Brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev UK is getting increasingly irked with SABMiller\u2019s refusal to accept its \u00a365bn takeover offer. AB INBev just released a new statement to the City, saying it is \u201csurprised\u201d that SAB says the latest offer, at \u00a342.15 per share, \u201cstill very substantially undervalues\u201d it. Carlos Brito, AB InBev\u2019s CEO, insists shareholders are being offered a good deal, and suggests they make their view known to SAB\u2019s management. \u201cNotwithstanding our good faith efforts, the Board of SABMiller has refused to meaningfully engage with us. Our proposal creates significant value for everybody. How long will it be before shareholders see a value of over \u00a342 in the absence of an offer from AB InBev? If shareholders agree that we should be in proper discussions, they should voice their views and should not allow the Board of SABMiller to frustrate this process and let this opportunity slip away.\u201d SAB\u2019s shares were worth around \u00a330 before AB InBev made its first approach, and are now trading around \u00a336. New trade data from Greece shows that imports and exports both fell sharply in August, as capital controls continued to grip the economy. Imports slumped by 8.9% year-on-year, according to stats body Elstat, from \u20ac3.3bn to \u20ac3bn. Exports also contracted by 8.9%, from \u20ac2.08bn to \u20ac1.89bn. That includes a 22% fall in exports to countries outside the EU. Greek firms have warned that the restrictions on capital flow imposed in July are hurting the economy very badly. Capital controls make it hard to buy raw materials from overseas, or sell finished goods to overseas buyers. Elstat also reported that the Greek unemployment rate was unchanged in July, at 25%. Curiously, Deutsche Bank shares are now rallying in Frankfurt, reversing their early selloff. That\u2019s quite a turnaround, given they were expected to shed 10% after it announced its \u20ac6bn loss. Investors may be reassured that joint-CEO John Cryan is getting to grips with Deutsche\u2019s problems, by cutting jobs and admitting that some assets are overvalued. Shares, eh? The emerging market slowdown will be high on the agenda as global policymakers gather in Lima for the latest annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. My colleague Heather Stewart explains: Brazil and Russia are in recession, China is slowing sharply, and a string of other emerging countries, including Turkey and Venezuela, look vulnerable to the combination of falling commodity prices and a strengthening dollar. Finance ministers will discuss how to prevent this weakness from spiralling into a full-blown financial crisis. Other key themes include tax avoidance, Greece, and the impact of a US interest rate hike. Heather\u2019s preview of the meeting has more details: It\u2019s not a great day for Europe\u2019s powerhouse economy. And it could get worse, when VW\u2019s US boss testifies at Capitol Hill this afternoon (from 3pm BST). Michael Horn will apologise for the emissions scandal, and tell Congress that he was aware of the problem last year, according to his prepared testimony. Shares in Deutsche Bank have slid by 2.5% in early trading. That\u2019s a smaller fall than feared, as traders digest the news that it will lose \u20ac6bn in the third quarter of 2015, its biggest quarterly loss in at least a decade. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: In a late night announcement that shocked analysts, Germany\u2019s biggest bank blamed huge impairment charges of \u20ac5.8bn for the unexpected losses. Forecasts had been for profits of around \u20ac1bn. The charges are related to higher capital requirements for Deutsche\u2019s investment bank and the reduced value of its Postbank division, which is up for sale. Deutsche also took a \u20ac600m writedown on the value of its 20% stake in China\u2019s Hua Xia Bank, which it also wants to offload. It bought the stake in 2005 and it is now worth about $3.5bn. The disappointing German trade data is pushing down shares in Frankfurt. Germany\u2019s DAX has shed 51 points, or 0.5%, in early trading. Big exporters such as pharmaceuticals firm Bayer and chemicals giant BASF are among the fallers. Another sign that China\u2019s rebalancing is hurting Germany: Pau Morilla-Giner, chief investment officer at London &amp; Capital Asset Management, says the weak economic data from Germany in August is a worry. Speaking on Bloomberg TV now, he\u2019s explaining that Germany is more exposed to the global economy than its neighbours: Germany is the canary in the coalmine for Europe. Holger Sandte, chief European economist at Nordea, agrees that Germany is being buffeted by problems in emerging markets: \u201cThis is a strong fall, the kind you don\u2019t see every day. Weakness in China, Brazil, Russia and other markets is having an impact.\u201d (quote via Reuters) It\u2019s worth noting that August can be a quieter month for trade, given the summer holidays in Europe. But still, a 5% drop in exports is certainly unusual. The slide in German exports in August is bad news for the European economy, argues Bloomberg TV\u2019s Hans Nichols. He warns that the eurozone core is looking shaky. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been looking to Germany to be the engine of growth in the eurozone. France is flat, and Germany looks like it may be flatlining.\u201d Hans also points out that these figures won\u2019t capture the impact of the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal on Germany\u2019s economy: \u201cThat\u2019s not only a psychological blow but a real economic outlook blow too.\u201d So September\u2019s data, due in a month\u2019s time, could be weak too..... Germany has just suffered its biggest fall in exports since the dark days of the financial crisis. It\u2019s another sign that storm clouds are gathering over the eurozone\u2019s largest economy. Exports slumped by 5.2% in August compared to July, according to new data from the Federal Statistics Office. It suggests the problems in China, and the wider slowdown in other emerging markets, is hitting demand for German products overseas. Economists had only expected a 0.9% fall. Imports fell by 3.1%, indicating domestic demand is weakening too. That means Germany\u2019s trade surplus shrank to \u20ac15.3bn, from \u20ac25bn in July. On an annual basis, exports were still 5% higher than in August 2014. But demand does appear to have tailed off over the summer: It\u2019s the third piece of bad economic data from Germany this week, following disappointing falls in factory orders and industrial production during August. Add in the Volkswagen scandal, and the problems emerging at Deutsche Bank, and the problems are piling up.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a busy day for central banks. Over in London, the Bank of England will release its latest interest rate decision, and the minutes of the meeting, at noon BST. The BoE is likely to leave interest rates on hold again. But the minutes will be closely watched, for signs that policymakers are more concerned over the global economy. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets sets the scene: Given the very low rates of inflation, the Bank of England should keep rates on hold at a record low 0.5%. The meeting minutes, which under the new format are released simultaneously, are expected to show the MPC again voted 8-1 to leave rates unchanged given global uncertainty. There\u2019s an outside chance that the recent jump in UK wage growth could compel Martin Weale to join Ian McCafferty in voting for a rate rise. Thirty minutes later, the European Central Bank releases the minutes of its last meeting in September. ECB chief economist Peter Praet is giving a speech around the same time. And at 7pm BST, the Federal Reserve release their own minutes. They could also shift the markets, given the constant chatter over when the Fed might raise rates. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is actually in Lima today for the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meeting. He\u2019s appearing on a panel from 7pm BST, along with IMF MD Christine Lagarde and Brazilian finance minister Joaquim Levy. We should hear from Lagarde at 3pm BST, when she briefs the press. Also coming up today... US politicians in Washington are preparing to grill Michael Horn, president and chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, over the emissions scandal. That starts at 3pm BST (10am local time). And we\u2019ll be watching Deutsche Bank, after the German bank stunned investors last night by announcing it expects a $7bn loss this quarter, due to problems at its corporate banking unit. Shares are probably going to take a pasting when Frankfurt opens.... We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Banks have continually experimented with ways to charge still more fees for giving us access to our own cash.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold amid signs that ultra-low UK inflation is here to stay for a while longer. Members of the Bank\u2019s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted eight to one to leave rates at 0.5%, where they have been since March 2009, in a repeat of voting numbers seen for the past two months. Minutes of the MPC meeting [PDF] confirmed the Bank\u2019s forecast for UK growth to slow to 0.6% in the third quarter, down from 0.7% in the previous three months. However, it delivered some welcome news for households as it predicted inflation would remain close to zero for longer, staying below 1% until spring 2016. David Kern, chief economist of the British Chambers of Commerce, welcomed the Bank\u2019s decision to leave rates on hold. A rate hike now would threaten the recovery, Kern said. \u201cThe UK recovery, although on course, is still fragile \u2013 it remains too reliant on consumer spending and is facing headwinds. Many major economies are experiencing difficulties that will inevitably increase the challenges for our exporters,\u201d Kern said. James Knightley, economist at ING, said next week\u2019s unemployment and wage figures would be key to MPC voting patterns in November. He believes other policymakers may join Ian McCafferty in voting for a rise next month if wages continue to increase, which would put pressure on inflation. He added: \u201cWe continue to look for the BoE to raise rates in the first half of 2016, well ahead of the fourth quarter 2016 move financial markets are currently pricing.\u201d The outlook for Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation \u2013 currently at zero \u2013 is weaker than the Bank had previously forecast and eases any immediate pressure on policymakers to raise rates. The minutes showed that McCafferty believed cost pressures in the UK would raise inflation above the Bank\u2019s 2% target within two years. He voted to raise rates to 0.75%, judging that an immediate hike would also allow a more gradual rise in the cost of borrowing over time. The MPC said UK growth was recording a \u201cgentle deceleration\u201d since hitting a peak in 2014 and could continue to ease back if the global economy weakens. It said despite recent stock market falls prompted by fears over the slowdown in China\u2019s economy, there had been few signs of a marked weakening in Chinese activity in recent data. However, it added that the slowdown in other emerging markets, such as Latin America, had been \u201cacute\u201d. The comments follow warnings late on Wednesday from the International Monetary Fund that risks of a global financial crash had increased as the slowdown in China and potential US rate rises threaten the stability of debt-laden emerging economies. The minutes showed that some MPC members felt the outlook for world growth was \u201csomewhat weaker\u201d than forecast in the Bank\u2019s August inflation report. More details on the Bank\u2019s outlook for UK growth and rates will be given in the next inflation report on November 5. Markets are not expecting rates to rise until late 2016 or even early 2017 after a tumultuous summer for financial markets, prompted by fears over China, although many economists are still pencilling in a rise in the first quarter of 2016. Thursday\u2019s minutes also showed that the MPC was unanimous in holding its quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn.",

A rate hike now would threaten the recovery, Kern said.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK recovery, although on course, is still fragile \u2013 it remains too reliant on consumer spending and is facing headwinds. Many major economies are experiencing difficulties that will inevitably increase the challenges for our exporters,\u201d Kern said.</p> <p>James Knightley, economist at ING, said next week\u2019s unemployment and wage figures would be key to MPC voting patterns in November. </p> <p>He believes other policymakers may join Ian McCafferty in voting for a rise next month if wages continue to increase, which would put pressure on inflation. <br>He added: \u201cWe continue to look for the BoE to raise rates in the first half of 2016, well ahead of the fourth quarter 2016 move financial markets are currently pricing.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/17/uk-inflation-cpi-low-deflation-wages-danger\">The outlook for Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation </a>\u2013 currently at zero \u2013 is weaker than the Bank had previously forecast and eases any immediate pressure on policymakers to raise rates. </p> <p>The minutes showed that McCafferty believed cost pressures in the UK would raise inflation above the Bank\u2019s 2% target within two years. </p> <p>He voted to raise rates to 0.75%, judging that an immediate hike would also allow a more gradual rise in the cost of borrowing over time. </p> <p>The MPC said UK growth was recording a \u201cgentle deceleration\u201d since hitting a peak in 2014 and could continue to ease back if the global economy weakens. It said despite recent stock market falls prompted by fears over the slowdown in China\u2019s economy, there had been few signs of a marked weakening in Chinese activity in recent data. </p> <p>However, it added that the slowdown in other emerging markets, such as Latin America, had been \u201cacute\u201d. </p> <p>The comments follow warnings late on Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/07/risk-global-financial-crash-increased-imf-emerging-economies-eurozone-stability-report\">from the International Monetary Fund that risks of a global financial crash had increased</a> as the slowdown in China and potential US rate rises threaten the stability of debt-laden emerging economies. </p> <p>The minutes showed that some MPC members felt the outlook for world growth was \u201csomewhat weaker\u201d than forecast in the Bank\u2019s August inflation report. <br>More details on the Bank\u2019s outlook for UK growth and rates will be given in the next inflation report on November 5. </p> <p>Markets are not expecting rates to rise until late 2016 or even early 2017 after a tumultuous summer for financial markets, prompted by fears over China, although many economists are still pencilling in a rise in the first quarter of 2016. </p> <p>Thursday\u2019s minutes also showed that the MPC was unanimous in holding its quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn. <br></p>",

Even if the cost savings and sourcing gains come through on track, and food stays in positive territory (neither certain), that won\u2019t hold back the tide. A second half like for like bounce-back is unlikely: for us the bottom line is that without general merchandise sales growth, the shares are likely to struggle. We have anecdotally picked up from core shoppers that the product is slipping in quality terms: is M&amp;S finding some of its gross margin gains by compromising the spec of the garments? It\u2019s not impossible and if it is, then it will be a long road back in customers\u2019 eyes. It\u2019s more likely that M&amp;S is simply failing to keep up with the demands of its broad church of customers. Something else that will concern those invested in M&amp;S for cash flow is that we think the stores need capital expenditure to bring them up to standard. The lack of excitement/flair is another thing that core shoppers persistently report to us. Marks shares are currently down 6.4p or more than 1% at 492.7p.",

      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank has warned it will lose more than \u20ac6bn (\u00a34.4bn) in the third quarter in a record loss. In a late-night announcement that shocked analysts, Germany\u2019s biggest bank blamed huge impairment charges of \u20ac5.8bn for the unexpected losses. Forecasts had been for profits of about \u20ac1bn. Deutsche is one of the pillars of corporate Germany, along with Volkswagen, which has been rocked by the emissions-rigging scandal. Deutsche\u2019s new boss, John Cryan, who took over in July, set about cleaning up the bank and hinted at cuts to bankers\u2019 bonuses, while dividend payments to shareholders could also be reduced or scrapped altogether. Analysts and investors welcomed the cleanup, and Deutsche shares rose 1% after falling 3% earlier. One top 10 shareholder told Reuters: \u201cLong-time board members often hesitate to do drastic cuts. Now there\u2019s a wind of change.\u201d The impairment charges are related to higher capital requirements for Deutsche\u2019s investment bank and the reduced value of its Postbank retail banking division, which is up for sale. The Frankfurt-based lender also took a \u20ac600m writedown on the value of its 20% stake in China\u2019s Hua Xia Bank, which it wants to offload. It bought the stake in 2005 and it is now worth about $3.5bn (\u00a32.3bn). On top of this, the bank is setting aside \u20ac1.2bn to cover litigation costs. Like other banks, Deutsche has been caught up in the Libor-rigging scandal, and faces another investigation in Switzerland for suspected price-fixing in the precious metal market. The charges will push Deutsche into an estimated net loss of \u20ac6.2bn between July and September. On a pretax basis the company expects to lose \u20ac6bn but excluding the impairment charges, the loss would be \u20ac200m. Cryan is planning to reduce the workforce by a quarter, or 23,000 jobs, to bring costs down and avoid a fundraising from shareholders. The Postbank sale will reduce Deutsche\u2019s workforce by 15,000, and the lender is reportedly considering cutting 8,000 additional jobs. Bankers\u2019 bonuses could also be cut. In a memo, Cryan told staff on Wednesday night that they would have to shoulder some of the burden. He wrote: \u201cWhile compensation considerations are not based on this year\u2019s financial results alone, our shareholders will rightly expect employees to share something of the burden.\u201d Cryan will set out the details of his strategic review when the bank releases its third-quarter results on 29 October. UBS analysts Daniele Brupbacher and Mate Nemes said the bank\u2019s cleanup was partially hiding good results. While painful, \u201cthe goodwill impairment charges are paving the way for streamlining the bank\u2019s business portfolio and part of strategy 2020,\u201d they said. Stripping out the goodwill impairment, the impact of Hua Xia and litigation provisions, the pretax profit would be \u20ac1.6bn, 11% higher than the analysts\u2019 consensus and 17% above the UBS estimate. Markets were relieved that the measures would not affect the bank\u2019s capital ratio.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meeting gets under way against a backdrop of rising concern over the health of the global economy. From the travails of emerging economies to the scale of the Chinese downturn, there is much to debate at the gathering in Lima, alongside tackling longstanding problems such as cracking down on the tax affairs of multinational corporations. Emerging economies on the brink The IMF\u2019s annual meetings are a moment for the finance ministers and central bankers from the Washington-based lender\u2019s 188 member-countries to share their concerns about the state of the financial world. This year, it is the emerging economies, which helped to lift global growth in the aftermath of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, that are provoking most anxiety. Brazil and Russia are in recession, China is slowing sharply, and a string of other emerging countries, including Turkey and Venezuela, look vulnerable to the combination of falling commodity prices and a strengthening dollar. Finance ministers will discuss how to prevent this weakness from spiralling into a full-blown financial crisis. China downturn China\u2019s downturn has come just as it had hoped to gain admission to the club of fully fledged, grown-up IMF members. Beijing has long hoped that China\u2019s currency, the yuan, would be admitted to the so-called special drawing rights basket \u2014 the small list of currencies in which member-countries\u2019 claims on the IMF are denominated. China hopes this stamp of approval from the IMF will increase the yuan\u2019s desirability as a reserve currency for investors, and undermine the hegemony of the dollar as a global reserve currency. A decision is due to be made by the IMF\u2019s board in November, and Beijing\u2019s unexpected devaluation in the summer was badged as a move towards allowing the market, instead of the government, to fix the renminbi\u2019s value \u2014 a precondition of inclusion.

But with its debt-to-GDP ratio expected to peak at 206%, according to the IMF\u2019s latest estimates, pressure remains on the eurozone to offer substantial debt forgiveness. Tax avoidance George Osborne, who will fly to Lima fresh from the Conservative party conference in Manchester, will be focusing on the latest global efforts to prevent multinational companies from avoiding paying their fair share of corporation tax. The Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development published proposals earlier this week for combating \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting\u201d \u2013 the accounting tricks used to shuffle profits into low-tax jurisdictions.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australian car owners are threatening to sue Volkswagen after learning that their cars are embroiled in the worldwide emission-rigging scandal. More than a fortnight after the scandal emerged, Volkswagen has admitted that more than 90,000 local cars are fitted out with software that cheats pollution tests. Law firm Maurice Blackburn is preparing to launch a class action law suit against the automobile giant under consumer law and has been contacted by nearly 1,000 claimants so far. Class actions principal Damian Scattini said that customer concerns ranged from the resale values of the vehicles, the impact of repairs on engines\u2019 longevity and environmental concerns. \u201cI would imagine that if you were a VW owner then you would join the action, why wouldn\u2019t you? It won\u2019t cost you anything and it seems like your one opportunity to get back from Volkswagen what they\u2019ve done to you,\u201d he told AAP. Paul Fletcher, the minister for major projects, said Volkswagen has breached Australian consumer law by fitting vehicles with devices designed to disguise the amount of emissions produced. \u201cThis a breach of the design rules so that is a very troubling thing and, in turn, a breach of the Australian consumer law,\u201d Fletcher told ABC TV on Thursday. \u201cNow of course, we need to understand what their plan is to correct \u2026 the vehicles that have this device installed, and we are pressing them with this information. \u201cWe are pursuing, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in particular, this question of whether there have been breaches of the law, and what redress or what remedies are available for breaching consumer law.\u201d But the minister would not be drawn on whether the federal government would take the car company to court over the breaches, insisting the ACCC was the appropriate \u201cenforcement agency\u201d. The ACCC is conducting an investigation into the scandal, which is thought to affect 11m vehicles worldwide. VW could face a fine of $1.1m per breach if a court finds it did breach certain consumer laws. Volkswagen Australia admitted 77,149 of its cars sold between 2008 and 2015 were fitted with software that cheated pollution tests, while its subsidiary Audi Australia said 14,028 of its vehicles were affected. Both brands have launched websites for customers to check if their vehicles are affected. But Volkswagen drivers have been told to take no action until a technical solution is made available by the company\u2019s head office in Germany. The NRMA criticised the carmaker\u2019s response to the crisis locally, as confirmation of Australia\u2019s inclusion in the global scandal came more than a fortnight after the news broke. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken this long for VW to communicate that into Australia and even now we don\u2019t have enough info about what the recall will involve,\u201d a spokesman, Peter Khoury, said on Thursday. \u201cI think that it\u2019s further evidence that we need to get tougher regulations in Australia because we currently have a situation which basically enables car manufacturers to decide when and how they\u2019ll do the recall, and it\u2019s not working.\u201d Fletcher said the government expected Audi and Volkswagen to continue to work with it to deal with the matter. Last week Volkswagen announced plans to recall and refit up to 11m affected vehicles worldwide. Khoury said he understood customers would be alarmed and angry about the deception and the impact on the resale value of their vehicles. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want cars that would be polluting the environment, that are going to be spewing out more emissions than they should,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, unfortunately in this case we\u2019ve got a car that\u2019s lying to its owner, that\u2019s telling its owner that it is emitting less carbon monoxide than it is, and also affecting the fuel efficiency.\u201d He called for more powers to be given to the federal government to step in rather than leaving the recall to the manufacturer. \u201cIt is fundamental through this process now that the consumer be put first and that\u2019s both through the recall stage and whatever compensation process may have to be put into place here because people were duped,\u201d he said.
