    "webTitle": "Vodafone agrees \u00a31bn deal for Cable & Wireless Worldwide", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vodafone's \u00a31.04bn offer for Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide has hit a roadblock with CWW's largest shareholder declining to back the bid. The acquisition, which on Monday won the support of the CWW board and a number of large shareholders, would vault Vodafone from fourth to second place after BT Group in the ranking of the largest UK telecoms operators. But fund manager Orbis Investment Management, CWW's largest investor with over 19% of the stock, said the 38p a share final offer does not \"reflect the value\" of a company whose stock price has collapsed over the last two years. Orbis has held a major stake in Cable &amp; Wireless for a decade, and has used the share price collapse to significantly increase its position, more than doubling its stake at an average of 53p a share over the last two years, according to one banking source. Orbis held 6.8% of the shares in March 2010, at the time the company demerged from its sister operation Cable &amp; Wireless Communications, which operates in the Caribbean. It declined to comment on the cost of its investment in CWW, but it is thought the company could take a painful hit if the current offer goes ahead. The fund manager said: \"The proposed deal is clearly attractive for Vodafone shareholders. However, we are concerned that the offer price does not appear to reflect the value inherent in CWW. Although we believe the CWW management team has handled the bid process responsibly, we have declined to give an irrevocable undertaking or letter of intent to support the transaction.\" Vodafone must secure 75% of the vote at a yet to be scheduled shareholder meeting for its acquisition to go ahead. Orbis has not said it will vote against the offer, but holds a large enough stake to block the deal if only three-quarters of shareholders use their votes. Orbis may prefer Vodafone to change the acquisition format from a vote to a \"takeover offer\" by which individual shareholders could be bought out, allowing some to negotiate a higher price. In its offer document, Vodafone has reserved the right to switch to a takeover offer. Analysts said the chances of Vodafone increasing its offer were slim, given the only other bidder, Tata Communications, drew back last week having reportedly offered just 25p a share. \"The risk is Vodafone walks away completely and shareholders are left without any offer,\" said Nick Brown at Espirito Santo bank. Five major shareholders \u2013 JP Morgan Asset Management, Investec Asset Management, Cyrte Investments, RBC Global Asset Management and Sky Investment Counsel \u2013 representing almost one fifth of the shares, have declared their support for the deal. The merger would boost Vodafone's UK revenues to nearly \u00a37bn, behind BT with \u00a315.6bn, but allowing it to overtake rival mobile networks Everything Everywhere and O2 in income. It will allow the UK's third largest mobile operator to take on BT and Virgin Media in offering telecoms and data hosting solutions to the business sector. CWW's fibre-optic network, one of the largest in the UK with 20,500km of cables, will also allow Vodafone to carry more mobile internet traffic at a lower cost. Analyst Robin Bienenstock at broker Sanford C Bernstein said Vodafone would gain \"a strategic advantage in the UK market\" and present a \"greater competitive threat\" to both BT and Virgin Media, which is hoping half of its future growth will come from business customers. Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao said: \"The acquisition of Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide creates a leading integrated player in the enterprise segment of the UK communications market and brings attractive cost savings to our UK and international operations.\" Colao declined to put a number on job cuts or say whether CWW's current chief executive Gavin Darby, a former executive at the mobile company, would have a role in the combined group. Darby stands to gain over \u00a31m from the deal just five months after replacing John Pluthero at the helm. He is contractually entitled to a year's salary of \u00a3600,000, whether or not he gets a job under the new owners. The board may also grant a portion of the \u00a3600,000 in stock options he was given on joining, although it is understood Darby's remuneration would stay below seven figures. Lastly, he will book a \u00a3420,000 profit on 2m shares he bought with his own money on joining. The Communication Workers Union raised concerns over job losses. Andy Kerr, CWU deputy general secretary, said: \"This appears to be a no-brainer for Vodafone who look set to make significant tax savings on CWW losses which could cover the purchase price. We would have thought more tax evasion stories would be the last thing Vodafone would want. \"In our experience, whenever there's a takeover there are job losses and staff in CWW in particular will be feeling concerned right now.\" CWW shares closed up 14% at 36.44p, slightly below the Vodafone offer price.",

      "body": "<p>Fears of a long recession in the eurozone and increasing political instability in the Netherlands, France and the Czech Republic sent stock markets tumbling across the continent on Monday.</p> <p>Weak manufacturing output across Europe and the fall of the Dutch coalition government combined to spooktraders, who sold the euro and continental shares in favour of safer US dollars.</p> <p>The German Dax dropped more than 3.5% and the French Cac fell by 2.8%. In London \u00a327.6bn was wiped from the value of the FTSE as it dropped nearly 2% to 5665.</p> <p>The euro's poor performance, which also reflected the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the French presidential election, left the currency trading at 81.5p against the pound.</p> <p>\"My fear at the moment is that [investors] appear to be panicking because the outcomes are getting more uncertain as we get further into this crisis \u2013 not less uncertain,\" said Paul Kavanagh, a partner at brokers Killik &amp; Co.</p> <p>The yield on Italy's benchmark 10-year bond pushed past 5.7% in the afternoon, extending the gap with German securities to 406 basis points. The Spanish 10-year yield was also unsustainably high after rising two basis points to 5.98%.</p> <p>Analysts said an early look at economic surveys revealed that the European Central Bank's confidence-boosting injection of funds into the banking system had petered out and the eurozone was heading for a longer and deeper recession than expected.</p> <p>The ECB has injected \u20ac350bn (\u00a3285bn) into the European banking system since December and played a part in constructing an \u20ac800bn firewall of guarantees and insurances to protect against Italy and Spain suffering a run on their debt. However, these two key measures are widely considered to be insufficient to boost confidence and revive the struggling economies of the worst-hit countries. Several European leaders have criticised the ECB for its failure to mimic the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have created electronic money under their quantitative easing programmes.</p> <p>All the main parties in France, including President Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP, have shifted the blame for the eurozone's woes to the lack of decisive action from the central bank.</p> <p>National Front leader Marine le Pen was particularly critical of the ECB and blamed the poor economic outlook on excessive austerity measures imposed by European institutions.</p> <p>Figures from the combined purchasing managers' index (PMI) survey by Markit appeared to support these fears after they registered a weaker than expected composite PMI of 47.4 for the eurozone in April, consistent with a quarter-on-quarter contraction in GDP of about 0.3%. A figure of below 50 on the index denotes a contraction. The manufacturing index fell particularly sharply to 46 from 47.7, the weakest reading since mid-2009.</p> <p>Services output remained stronger than manufacturing, but suffered a quicker slowdown. It fell to 47.9 from an earlier 49.2, the softest reading of activity since November last year.</p> <p>Official statistics from Eurostat showing a rise in sovereign debts also added to the grim picture. Ireland's debts rose by 13.1% last year. Italy ended 2011 with the second highest debt at 120.1% of GDP, after Greece at 165.3%. Spain's rose to 68.5% from 61.2%. Germany was the only country to cut its lending, with its debt shrinking to 81.2% from 83%.</p> <p>Across the 27-country EU, the average 2011 deficit was 4.5% of GDP, down from 6.5% in 2010. Among the EU states that do not use the euro, the UK had the highest deficit, which reached 8.4% of GDP in the year ended 31 March, equivalent to about 64% of GDP.</p> <p>Only five eurozone nations \u2013 Estonia, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland \u2013 had debt within the eurozone's limit of 60% of GDP.</p> <p>The head of the influential German Ifo thinktank raised the pressure on Greece and other countries. \"I personally believe there's no chance for Greece to become competitive (while) in the eurozone,\" Hans-Werner Sinn, president of Ifo, said in a luncheon speech in New York. \"If Greece is kept in the eurozone, there will be ongoing mass unemployment.\"</p> <p>He also cited risks for other indebted eurozone countries. \"Cutting wages and prices to the extent necessary in some southern European countries is impossible, whatever politicians say,\" Sinn said.</p> <p>The region's overall budget deficit declined to 4.1% of GDP from 6.2% as nations from Greece to Spain and France implemented austerity measures aimed at stopping the spread of the debt crisis and convincing investors that Europe can shore up its public finances.</p> <p>Jim Leaviss, head of the fund manager M&amp;G's main bond fund, warned that the developments across the eurozone could pose problems for the UK. He said the slowdown in output on the continent and a rise in the value of sterling could act as a double whammy, threatening the UK's export drive.

      "bodyText": "Fears of a long recession in the eurozone and increasing political instability in the Netherlands, France and the Czech Republic sent stock markets tumbling across the continent on Monday. Weak manufacturing output across Europe and the fall of the Dutch coalition government combined to spooktraders, who sold the euro and continental shares in favour of safer US dollars. The German Dax dropped more than 3.5% and the French Cac fell by 2.8%. In London \u00a327.6bn was wiped from the value of the FTSE as it dropped nearly 2% to 5665. The euro's poor performance, which also reflected the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the French presidential election, left the currency trading at 81.5p against the pound. \"My fear at the moment is that [investors] appear to be panicking because the outcomes are getting more uncertain as we get further into this crisis \u2013 not less uncertain,\" said Paul Kavanagh, a partner at brokers Killik &amp; Co. The yield on Italy's benchmark 10-year bond pushed past 5.7% in the afternoon, extending the gap with German securities to 406 basis points. The Spanish 10-year yield was also unsustainably high after rising two basis points to 5.98%. Analysts said an early look at economic surveys revealed that the European Central Bank's confidence-boosting injection of funds into the banking system had petered out and the eurozone was heading for a longer and deeper recession than expected. The ECB has injected \u20ac350bn (\u00a3285bn) into the European banking system since December and played a part in constructing an \u20ac800bn firewall of guarantees and insurances to protect against Italy and Spain suffering a run on their debt. However, these two key measures are widely considered to be insufficient to boost confidence and revive the struggling economies of the worst-hit countries. Several European leaders have criticised the ECB for its failure to mimic the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have created electronic money under their quantitative easing programmes. All the main parties in France, including President Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP, have shifted the blame for the eurozone's woes to the lack of decisive action from the central bank. National Front leader Marine le Pen was particularly critical of the ECB and blamed the poor economic outlook on excessive austerity measures imposed by European institutions. Figures from the combined purchasing managers' index (PMI) survey by Markit appeared to support these fears after they registered a weaker than expected composite PMI of 47.4 for the eurozone in April, consistent with a quarter-on-quarter contraction in GDP of about 0.3%. A figure of below 50 on the index denotes a contraction. The manufacturing index fell particularly sharply to 46 from 47.7, the weakest reading since mid-2009. Services output remained stronger than manufacturing, but suffered a quicker slowdown. It fell to 47.9 from an earlier 49.2, the softest reading of activity since November last year. Official statistics from Eurostat showing a rise in sovereign debts also added to the grim picture. Ireland's debts rose by 13.1% last year. Italy ended 2011 with the second highest debt at 120.1% of GDP, after Greece at 165.3%. Spain's rose to 68.5% from 61.2%. Germany was the only country to cut its lending, with its debt shrinking to 81.2% from 83%. Across the 27-country EU, the average 2011 deficit was 4.5% of GDP, down from 6.5% in 2010. Among the EU states that do not use the euro, the UK had the highest deficit, which reached 8.4% of GDP in the year ended 31 March, equivalent to about 64% of GDP. Only five eurozone nations \u2013 Estonia, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland \u2013 had debt within the eurozone's limit of 60% of GDP. The head of the influential German Ifo thinktank raised the pressure on Greece and other countries. \"I personally believe there's no chance for Greece to become competitive (while) in the eurozone,\" Hans-Werner Sinn, president of Ifo, said in a luncheon speech in New York. \"If Greece is kept in the eurozone, there will be ongoing mass unemployment.\" He also cited risks for other indebted eurozone countries. \"Cutting wages and prices to the extent necessary in some southern European countries is impossible, whatever politicians say,\" Sinn said. The region's overall budget deficit declined to 4.1% of GDP from 6.2% as nations from Greece to Spain and France implemented austerity measures aimed at stopping the spread of the debt crisis and convincing investors that Europe can shore up its public finances. Jim Leaviss, head of the fund manager M&amp;G's main bond fund, warned that the developments across the eurozone could pose problems for the UK. He said the slowdown in output on the continent and a rise in the value of sterling could act as a double whammy, threatening the UK's export drive. A higher value on sterling will push up the price of UK goods abroad, while shrinking markets in Italy and Spain will cut demand for British exports. Leaviss said he calculated that a rise in the trade-weighted value of sterling since last year of 7.25% was equivalent to a significant monetary tightening by the Bank of England of 1.8%. Until now the BoE's quantitative easing programmehas offset any pressures on sterling's value. But the bank's interest rate-setting committee signalled last week that its QE programme would be halted indefinitely. The only positive response to the rise in sterling will be a drop in inflation, he said, as imports to the UK become cheaper. \"The strong pound will help send inflation below 3% during the course of the year, but at the expense of economic growth and a rebalancing of the economy towards manufacturing,\" he said.",

When the time comes, the best person for the job will be appointed, whoever she or he may be.\" The new governor of the Bank of England will given more powers, and MPs were on Monday night debating a change to the financial services bill that might make Threadneedle Street more accountable.",

BT's reaction will, however, be critical. The UK's No 1 player has enjoyed an easier life in the UK business market during CWW's agonies; Vodafone threatens to be a more formidable competitor.

Dr Dougie Youngson at Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> Borders share price has seen a massive increase over the past week in anticipation of a positive result from this well. We feel that the market will be disappointed by the fact that Darwin is not an oil discovery. <br> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Gulf Keystone Petroleum</strong> rose 24p to 235p after a positive test result from its Shaikan will in Kurdistan.

The disappointment of the headlines leads on to unanswered questions about underlying trading trends as well as management processes and controls. We have to conclude that it would be unwise to invest in the shares at this time. </blockquote> <p>Singer Capital Markets was no more positive. Analysts Mark Photiades and Matthew McEachran said:</p> <blockquote> We had previously kept faith with this growth story, despite the litany of recent hiccups. However, whilst we do not believe that the brand is dead, we accept that until confidence in forecasts materially improves the stock has become uninvestable for many. <br> [This latest setback] is particularly disappointing in the context of our meeting with management on 14 March after which we became increasingly confident that, having made mistakes before and having substantially strengthened the senior management team, SuperGroup had got back on track. We were wrong. </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Imagination Technologies</strong> fell 9p to 673.5p despite announcing it had signed a licensing deal with US group Qualcomm Communications for certain of its broadcast intellectual property. Eoin Lambe at Liberum Capital said:</p> <blockquote> This [agreement] is not for Imagination's core graphics IP, but for Ensigma which is primarily used in TVs. Qualcomm continue to rely on its own internal graphics team, but looks to be targeting the TV space and requires TV demodulation IP (Ensigma) to launch TV products. Minor positive for Imagination, but importantly not for graphics. </blockquote>",

Dr Dougie Youngson at Seymour Pierce said: Borders share price has seen a massive increase over the past week in anticipation of a positive result from this well. We feel that the market will be disappointed by the fact that Darwin is not an oil discovery. But Gulf Keystone Petroleum rose 24p to 235p after a positive test result from its Shaikan will in Kurdistan. Analyst Stuart Joyner at Investec raised his target price from 191p to 232p and said: The company is set to move forward with a full development programme and this announcement will provide the government with an assurance that Gulf Keystone is proving up the resource base to achieve this objective. SuperGroup continued its slump following the fashion retailer's profit warning on Friday. Its shares dropped another 16.8p to 335p, with Peel Hunt saying: One profit warning too many for us from SuperGroup. The disappointment of the headlines leads on to unanswered questions about underlying trading trends as well as management processes and controls. We have to conclude that it would be unwise to invest in the shares at this time. Singer Capital Markets was no more positive. Analysts Mark Photiades and Matthew McEachran said: We had previously kept faith with this growth story, despite the litany of recent hiccups. However, whilst we do not believe that the brand is dead, we accept that until confidence in forecasts materially improves the stock has become uninvestable for many. [This latest setback] is particularly disappointing in the context of our meeting with management on 14 March after which we became increasingly confident that, having made mistakes before and having substantially strengthened the senior management team, SuperGroup had got back on track. We were wrong. Finally Imagination Technologies fell 9p to 673.5p despite announcing it had signed a licensing deal with US group Qualcomm Communications for certain of its broadcast intellectual property. Eoin Lambe at Liberum Capital said: This [agreement] is not for Imagination's core graphics IP, but for Ensigma which is primarily used in TVs. Qualcomm continue to rely on its own internal graphics team, but looks to be targeting the TV space and requires TV demodulation IP (Ensigma) to launch TV products. Minor positive for Imagination, but importantly not for graphics.",

House of Lords reform aside, how does Pritchard gauge tiptoeing versus stalled? We don't appear to be tiptoeing anywhere, at least not forwards. If the economy is moving, maybe a crab analogy is more apt as the economy takes yet another sideways walk. On Wednesday the Office for National Statistics will tell us whether the economy took a few steps forward or back in the first three months of the year. A figure of 0.2% either way will reinforce a position of stasis. Lending figures from the Bank of England on Monday reinforce this view. For the three months to February, the stock of lending to SMEs contracted and mortgage approvals fell. As Chuka Umunna MP, Labour's shadow business secretary, points out, the net monthly flow of lending in February was at its lowest in almost two years and has fallen in every month since the coalition government took office. Without lending, all but the largest businesses (which remain cash-rich) are going nowhere fast. Unable to borrow vital funds for investment in new equipment or staff who can generate new business, they are stymied. Exports were the great hope of the Treasury. A 25% reduction in the pound would negate the need for investment. Foreign buyers would hoover up UK goods simply on price. But it is a strategy that can claim only limited success and is about to hit the buffers. Today's euro area flash business surveys are gloomy and point to a contraction in output in the runup to the summer. James Ashley, a senior economist at RBC Capital Markets, says: \"Overall, these latest PMIs are weaker than expected and cast doubt on the euro area's imminent emergence from recession \u2013 a recession which we expect to be confirmed next month when the Q1 'flash' GDP estimates are published.\" We already have inflation rising at double the rate of average wage rises, between \u00a32bn and \u00a33bn being taken out of tax credits and child benefit (equivalent to almost 1p on income tax), and unemployment stuck above 2.5 million. There is an expectation among the official forecasters (the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility) that the economy will spring to life next year, but without any explanation as to how. Maybe growth will canter ahead, from a standing start, but apart from a technical bounce from a long period of austerity, it is hard to see, especially as austerity is pencilled in until 2017.",

      "bodyText": "Mining companies and banks are leading the way lower as markets get the week off to a bad start. Early news of poor Chinese manufacturing figures rekindled fears about global economic demand, with the HSBC purchasing manager's index coming in at 49.1, its sixth consecutive month below 50, signalling continued contraction. Then came disappointing data from France and Germany, while news of a political crisis in the Netherlands and the early results from the French election has also unsettled investors. So the FTSE 100 is down 80 points at 5692.15, having earlier fallen as low as 5673. With the weak economic data, copper and other base metals have slipped back, knocking Vedanta Resources 43p lower at \u00a311.94 and leaving Rio Tinto 111p lower at \u00a334.36. Worries about banks' exposure to the fragile eurozone countries has pushed Royal Bank of Scotland down 0.79p to 23.23p and Lloyds Banking Group 0.73p lower to 29.37p. But Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide has jumped 5.25p to 37.25p following the long awaited 38p a share offer from Vodafone, up 0.5p to 172p.",
