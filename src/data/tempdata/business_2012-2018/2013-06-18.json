It cost \u00a3850,000 to produce and took evidence from more than 250 witnesses. Its recommendations include:</p> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong></p> <p>The banking standards commission believes George Osborne's plan for reprivatising RBS, \"risks being insufficient\". It recommends the chancellor conduct a detailed analysis of all the options for the bailed-out lender, including breaking it up into a good bank and a bad bank, before pressing ahead with privatisation.</p> <p>Tyrie and his colleagues would like to see a full report on the options \u2013 including splitting a \"good bank\" into several chunks to boost competition \u2013 published by September. \"If the operational and legal obstacles to a good bank/bad bank split are insuperable, the government should tell parliament why and submit its analysis to scrutiny,\" the report says.</p> <p>It does make one immediate recommendation over how RBS (and Lloyds) should be run: UKFI, the body charged with overseeing the government's investments in the rescued banks, should be dismantled, because it risks becoming a mere \"fig leaf\" for the direct interference of politicians. \"The current arrangements are clearly not acceptable,\" it says.</p> <p><strong>Criminal bankers</strong></p> <p>The report recommends a new criminal offence to make it easier to send top bankers to jail for \"reckless misconduct\". It wants to make top bankers more accountable for their actions and strip them of their bonuses and pensions if their banks have to be bailed out by the taxpayer.</p> <p>The commission insists it is not responding to the \"public demand for retribution\" after the 2008 banking crisis but says a new law is needed \"to correct the unbalanced incentives that pervade banking\". The proposed law, it says, would \"create a new incentive for bankers to do the right thing\".</p> <p>The \"fact that recklessness in carrying out professional responsibilities carries a risk of a criminal conviction and a prison sentence would give pause for thought to the senior officers of UK banks\".</p> <p>When banks are bailed out, regulators should be able to use discretionary powers to strip the bosses of their bonuses and pensions, the report said, and when top bankers quit they should be required to write a \"handover certificate\" outlining issues their successor should consider.</p> <p>The report suggests a wholesale shake-up of the current approval regime for bankers after finding that just 156,000 individuals are on the current register \u2013 which would allow regulators to take action against them.</p> <p>It should be replaced with a \"senior person regime\" where all responsibilities are assigned to a specific senior individuals in an attempt to address the problem that \"the most senior individuals at the highest level within banks, like Macavity, cannot be held responsible for even the most widespreads and flagrant failures\".</p> <p>The commission was concerned that enforcement action against approved people is as \"rare as hen's teeth\", noting that the bosses of neither HBOS nor RBS had faced enforcement action and no one has been punished over PPI.</p> <p><strong>Bankers' pay</strong></p> <p>The report called the City bonus culture \"thoroughly dysfunctional\" and called for a new remuneration code allowing bonuses to be deferred over 10 years. It also wants a radical overall of the way bonuses are calculated.</p> <p>Despite changes since the 2008 banking crisis that require bonuses to be spread over three years and no longer paid in cash, the commission warned: \"A culture of entitlement to high pay developed which has yet to be fully dispelled.\"</p> <p>But the 10 commissioners did not back the EU plan to cap bankers' bonuses at one times their salaries, or twice with explicit shareholder support. Instead they call for a change to the way the profits used to calculate pay are measured. The change would exclude unrealised profits made from thinly traded or illiquid markets and require regulators to be \"particularly sceptical\" about banks basing bonuses on \"return on equity\".</p> <p>\"Many of the so-called profits reported by banks in the boom years turned to dust when markets went into reverse. However, for some individual bankers they had served their purpose, having been used in calculation leading to huge bonuses which could not be recouped.\"</p> <p>The commissioners made recommendations after hearing that UBS could not claw back any pay from Tom Hayes, the trader charged with Libor rigging, when he moved to Citigroup because he had forfeited his deferred bonuses.</p> <p>The report said banks often bought out the outstanding bonuses of new recruits \u2013 \"tantamount to wiping the slate clean\". The commission said bankers should either keep their deferred pay when they leave, or their former employer should be able to recoup it from a new employer.</p> <p>The commission also argues that, \"in the most egregious cases\", it may be necessary to reclaim all pay that has already been paid out \u2013 not just deferred pay.</p> <p><strong>Bank accounts, competition</strong></p> <p>To boost competition, the report says, the Treasury should examine whether it is feasible to make bank accounts portable, in the same way that mobile numbers can be moved between providers.</p> <p>\"There is a lack of meaningful competition in retail banking in the UK. Customers are losing out,\" Tyrie said.</p> <p>However, the commission did not recommend a full-blown competition inquiry into a sector dominated by just four major banks. Instead it urges a study of the retail and small business market in time for a formal inquiry before the end of 2015.</p> <p>This matches the deadline by the independent commission on banking two years ago which is requiring banks to introduce a seven day switching service for current accounts by September.Tyrie's commission believes more radical reforms to bolster competition could be needed if the seven-day switching service for current accounts \u2013 due in September \u2013 does not break the stranglehold of Lloyds Banking Group, RBS, HSBC and Barclays on the current account market. Competition and effective market discipline can and should play a major role in bringing about higher standards. They can do much of the heavy lifting and help avoid onerous or flawed regulation. But fFurther radical reform may be needed if the changes currently being implement, such as seven-day switching, fail to have the desired effect,\" said Tyrie.</p> <p>The report calls for the City regulators to report to parliament in two years' time on a new regime to allow new banks to set up with less capital and welcomes the government's Damascene conversion to open up the payments system to new players. At the moment new banks have to use existing large banks to process payments. The report says ownership of the system should be taken from big banks.</p> <p><strong>Bank of England</strong></p> <p>The commission expresses a series of concerns about the Bank's role in the new regulatory structure created by Osborne to try to prevent another financial crisis.</p> <p>The commission wants the Bank made more accountable, by beefing up its \"Court\", to make it more like a full-blown board, instead of the largely ceremonial body of the past. The Treasury select committee has made the same recommendation. Tyrie and his colleagues also reject the chancellor's controversial decision to water down the recommendation of the Vickers commission, for a 4% minimum leverage ratio, forcing banks to hold equity equal to 4% of their total balance sheet.</p> <p>Under fierce lobbying from the banks, Osborne has opted instead for a 3% ratio. But the commission says that's too low; and the Bank's financial policy committee \u2013 not the chancellor \u2013 should be allowed to decide. The commission also wants the Bank governor to have special responsibility for warning about lobbying by the financial sector.</p> <p>It also calls on the department for communities and local government to review rules requiring local authorities to hold deposits with high rated banks to ensure it does not penalise any new players.</p> <p><strong>Women </strong></p> <p>More women on the trading floor would be beneficial for banks, the report said. The main UK-based banks should be forced to publish a breakdown of men and women on their trading floors and \"where there is a significant imbalance, what they are going to do to address the issue\".</p> <p><strong>Boardroom changes</strong></p> <p>Banks should have a full-time chairman to ensure tougher scrutiny of executive managers, the commission recommends. Too many chairmen, it said, had become no more than cheerleaders for a powerful chief executive and had failed to rein in risky plans for expansion.</p> <p>\"The corporate governance of large banks was characterised by the creation of Potemkin villages to give the appearance of effective control and oversight, without the reality.\"</p> <p>The risk of a full-time chair \"going native\" and failing to challenge the bank is overstated, the commission argues. Some banks are already moving in this direction. Douglas Flint is a full-time chair at HSBC, while Sir David Walker does four days a week at Barclays.</p> <p>The censure of \"weak chairmen\" follows an earlier commission report that slammed the HBOS board, led by Lord Stevenson, as a model of self-delusion, and found that many board members lacked the experience to see that the ship was headed for the rocks.</p> <p>Echoing these comments, the report said too few non-executive directors have a sufficient banking background, and a perception has arisen that independent-minded people are weeded out during the board selection process. The commission also wants a senior board member to take responsibilty for safeguarding any whistleblowers. This person would answer to the regulators for any allegations of wrong-doing against the bank. A whistleblower raised concerns about HBOS risks only to be made redundant.</p> <p><strong>Special measures</strong></p> <p>Banks whose conduct raises repeated concerns with regulators could be forced into a new \"special measures\" regime of intensive and frequent monitoring. Using the language adopted by the schools inspectorate Ofsted for struggling schools, the commission says the two new bank regulators \u2013 the Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 could put a bank into \"special measures\", if they detected failings such as weak leadership or poor risk management, which might reveal deeper problems.</p> <p>Special measures could be applied to situations such as the breakdown in the relationship between the previous FSA City watchdog and Barclays.</p> <p><strong>Accountancy changes</strong></p> <p>Accountancy rules do not hit the headlines, but the commission said they also played a part in the banking crisis. At the heart of the problem are global accounting rules \u2013 the International Financial Reporting Standards \u2013 which allowed banks to inflate assets and hide their liabilities.</p> <p>The commission concludes that the IFRS system is \"not fit for regulators' purposes\", but recognises the UK has little chance of reforming it, because it is enshrined in UK law under an EU directive. For this reason it recommends that banks provide a separate set of accounts drawn up on \"prudent principles\". This already happens in Portugal and Brazil, but the idea has prominent opponents, including the incoming governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney.</p>",

The definition excludes the value of a main home and of any \"consumer durables\" such as cars. World markets were volatile in the first half of 2012, as the eurozone crisis deepened; but after ECB president Mario Draghi promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to protect the single currency in July, and the Federal Reserve unleashed a drastic third round of quantitative easing in September, share prices recovered strongly, boosting the wealth of those with investments. The findings are likely to increase concerns that the benefits of central banks' radical policies to rekindle economic growth have accrued overwhelmingly to those at the top of society, while unemployment remains stubbornly high in many countries and incomes have been under severe pressure. Britain is home to the fifth-largest group of super-wealthy individuals, according to the report, with 465,000 super-rich individuals, up from 441,000 in 2011. The wealth report came as the latest UK inflation figures showed that with the consumer price index running at 2.7% in May wages for average British workers have now failed to keep up with prices for more than three years.

    "webTitle": "Lloyds raised Co-op capital concerns last year", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former chief executive of the troubled Co-operative Bank, Neville Richardson, has quit the boards of M&amp;S Bank and estate agency Countrywide in the wake of criticism of his tenure at the mutual. Richardson was the boss of Britannia building society when it merged with the Co-op Bank in a 2009 deal that is now facing scrutiny due to the bad debts it loaded on the Co-op. The bank has been downgraded to junk status and is raiding its bondholders to plug a \u00a31.5bn shortfall. Richardson insisted that he wanted to correct \"considerable inaccuracies\" about his role in the Britannia deal and his departure from the Co-op Bank in 2011. Announcing the resignation of the non-executive directorships last night, he said: \"Following the ill-informed and inaccurate commentary in the media concerning myself and my departure from the Co-operative Bank and the acquisition of Britannia Building Society by the Co-operative Group, this was the right thing to do.\" Richardson added that he would \"welcome\" the opportunity to assist any official enquiry into the Britannia merger or the events of two years ago. MPs were told yesterday that Lloyds Bank discovered an alarming shortfall in the Co-op Bank's capital position which made it unlikely the Co-op would ever be able to complete the purchase of 632 Lloyds branches. The discovery in December 2012 came five months before the shock Moody's report that downgraded the mutual's bonds and this week's \u00a31.5bn rescue package. In evidence to the Treasury select committee, the Lloyds chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, revealed that in December 2012 Co-op Bank privately handed Lloyds a revised projection of its future with the business it was planning to buy from Lloyds, and it became apparent that it did not have sufficient capital. \"We had doubts about Co-op's capability in December 2012 when we were given the revised plan for the Co-operative Group,\" he said. \"From the combined plan for Co-op and TSB, our analysis was clear that there was a shortfall of capital. And that was when we had our first concerns about their ability to close the deal.\" On Monday Co-op Bank unveiled a \u00a31.5bn rescue deal to plug a hole in its capital and stave off a taxpayer-funded bailout, which will see the bank's bondholders suffer deep losses. The recapitalisation came after Co-op Bank said in April that it was pulling out of the deal to buy the 632 Lloyds branches, which was swiftly followed by a six-notch downgrade of Co-op's bonds by the ratings agency Moody's. Moody's downgraded Co-op again on Tuesday, warning that \"further burden sharing\" may be required if the restructuring of the bank proves unsuccessful, and said bondholders may get as little as 35% of their initial investment back. It has also emerged that NBNK, the failed rival bidder for the Lloyds branches, warned the board of Lloyds in a letter in January 2012 that Co-op would not be able to finance a deal and that the \"overstretch\" would put Co-op's financial security and mutuality in jeopardy. Horta-Os\u00f3rio told MPs that Lloyds shared its concern about Co-op Bank with the regulator, then the Financial Services Authority, and demanded assurances from the mutual that it was still in a position to go ahead. \"We were told that Co-op Bank had several options that were meaningful, such as selling its asset management business. But we were concerned and we had doubts. We were reassured that they had options, but we were not totally reassured.\" From December Lloyds began to focus on plan B \u2013 the separate flotation of TSB as an independent bank \u2013 but the bank did not go public with its doubts about Co-op or pull out of the deal. Horta-Os\u00f3rio said Lloyds, since it was mandated by the EU to break up the bank, had in any case to press ahead with establishing a separate TSB entity, so gave Co-op the benefit of the doubt. \"We were surprised to see that there was suddenly a shortfall in capital [at Co-op]. But we had to go ahead and build a [separate] bank in any case,\" he said. Lloyds insists that at no time did it face political pressure to forge a deal with Co-op to boost the mutual sector. But Horta-Os\u00f3rio and the Lloyds chairman, Sir Win Bischoff, were repeatedly pressed by MPs on why it turned down the NBNK bid, which was worth \u00a3630m upfront compared with the \u00a3450m that Co-op was prepared to pay, plus a further \u00a3250m over time. Bischoff said: \"The Co-op Bank was an established bank, it had a relationship with the FSA, staff, and ratings from two agencies. NBNK had none of these \u2026 we gave them five opportunities to bid. We couldn't have done any more. Overall, the NBNK bid was slightly lower in capital terms.\" The letter that NBNK sent to the Lloyds board warned that Co-op could \"overgear itself and leave it financially vulnerable\" if it tried to buy the TSB business from Lloyds. It detailed concerns that IT systems at Co-op were \"in disarray\", that there were \"continued delays\" integrating Britannia Building Society and that the bank had a \"weak capital structure\". Bischoff confirmed that Lloyds received the letter but still felt at the time that Co-op represented the better bid. The failure of the Co-op deal may benefit the taxpayer owners of Lloyds, said Horta-Os\u00f3rio. The separate flotation of TSB will cost Lloyds \u00a31.6bn, he said, but the improvement in equity markets since the deal with Co-op means the prospect for the flotation is now much better. \"The taxpayer might come out ahead.\"",

      "body": "<p>The former chief executive of the troubled Co-operative Bank, Neville Richardson, has quit the boards of M&amp;S Bank and estate agency Countrywide in the wake of criticism of his tenure at the mutual.</p> <p>Richardson was the boss of Britannia building society when it merged with the Co-op Bank in a 2009 deal that is now facing scrutiny due to the bad debts it loaded on the Co-op. The bank has been downgraded to junk status and is raiding its bondholders to plug a \u00a31.5bn shortfall.</p> <p>Richardson insisted that he wanted to correct \"considerable inaccuracies\" about his role in the Britannia deal and his departure from the Co-op Bank in 2011.</p> <p>Announcing the resignation of the non-executive directorships last night, he said: \"Following the ill-informed and inaccurate commentary in the media concerning myself and my departure from the Co-operative Bank and the</p> <p>acquisition of Britannia Building Society by the Co-operative Group, this was the right thing to do.\"</p> <p>Richardson added that he would \"welcome\" the opportunity to assist any official enquiry into the Britannia merger or the events of two years ago.</p> <p>MPs were told yesterday that Lloyds Bank discovered an alarming shortfall in the Co-op Bank's capital position which made it unlikely the Co-op would ever be able to complete the purchase of 632 Lloyds branches. The discovery in December 2012 came five months before the shock Moody's report that downgraded the mutual's bonds and this week's \u00a31.5bn rescue package.</p> <p>In evidence to the Treasury select committee, the Lloyds chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, revealed that in December 2012 Co-op Bank privately handed Lloyds a revised projection of its future with the business it was planning to buy from Lloyds, and it became apparent that it did not have sufficient capital.</p> <p>\"We had doubts about Co-op's capability in December 2012 when we were given the revised plan for the Co-operative Group,\" he said. \"From the combined plan for Co-op and TSB, our analysis was clear that there was a shortfall of capital. And that was when we had our first concerns about their ability to close the deal.\"</p> <p>On <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/17/co-operative-bank-stock-market-listing\" title=\"\">Monday Co-op Bank unveiled a \u00a31.5bn rescue deal to plug a hole in its capital and stave off a taxpayer-funded bailout</a>, which will see the bank's bondholders suffer deep losses. The recapitalisation came after Co-op Bank said in April that it was pulling out of the deal to buy the 632 Lloyds branches, which was swiftly followed by a six-notch downgrade of Co-op's bonds by the ratings agency Moody's. Moody's downgraded Co-op again on Tuesday, warning that \"further burden sharing\" may be required if the restructuring of the bank proves unsuccessful, and said bondholders may get as little as 35% of their initial investment back.</p> <p>It has also emerged that NBNK, the failed rival bidder for the Lloyds branches, warned the board of Lloyds in a letter in January 2012 that Co-op would not be able to finance a deal and that the \"overstretch\" would put Co-op's financial security and mutuality in jeopardy.</p> <p>Horta-Os\u00f3rio told MPs that Lloyds shared its concern about Co-op Bank with the regulator, then the Financial Services Authority, and demanded assurances from the mutual that it was still in a position to go ahead. \"We were told that Co-op Bank had several options that were meaningful, such as selling its asset management business. But we were concerned and we had doubts. We were reassured that they had options, but we were not totally reassured.\"</p> <p>From December Lloyds began to focus on plan B \u2013 the separate flotation of TSB as an independent bank \u2013 but the bank did not go public with its doubts about Co-op or pull out of the deal.</p> <p>Horta-Os\u00f3rio said Lloyds, since it was mandated by the EU to break up the bank, had in any case to press ahead with establishing a separate TSB entity, so gave Co-op the benefit of the doubt. \"We were surprised to see that there was suddenly a shortfall in capital [at Co-op]. But we had to go ahead and build a [separate] bank in any case,\" he said.</p> <p>Lloyds insists that at no time did it face political pressure to forge a deal with Co-op to boost the mutual sector. But Horta-Os\u00f3rio and the Lloyds chairman, Sir Win Bischoff, were repeatedly pressed by MPs on why it turned down the NBNK bid, which was worth \u00a3630m upfront compared with the \u00a3450m that Co-op was prepared to pay, plus a further \u00a3250m over time.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The slump in European car sales has reached a fresh nadir with the worst figures for May in 20 years, eroding manufacturers' faint hopes of a recovery after more than five years of decline. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said demand for new cars in the European Union was down 5.9% on the same month last year. Just over a million cars were registered in the lowest total since 1993 \u2013 a blow to the industry after a slight, unexpected upturn in April. Amid negative negative economic growth across the eurozone, France, Germany and Italy all showed big declines in sales, with only the UK among the largest national markets bucking that trend. British car sales rose 11% in May. Car manufacturers have been struggling with ever more consumers unwilling or unable to afford new vehicles as unemployment rises. Several manufacturers have announced factory closures or deferred launching new models. Mark Fulthorpe, an automotive analyst at IHS, said: \"Clearly consumers are cowed in the big southern European markets. In Germany, the wider concerns about the state of the eurozone economy are beginning to affect consumer confidence there too, so we are begining to see them step back from those big purchases we were seeing them making more freely in 2012. But most of the markets are going to be slower while austerity is the flavour, particularly in the southern eurozone countries.\" IHS forecasts that sales of new cars in Europe will shrink about 4% this year from 2012, when 12,053,904 vehicles were sold, the lowest level since 1995. The German market, which remained steady throughout last year's slump, has now shrunk by 8.8% over the first five months of 2013, with French and Italian sales down 11.9% and 11.3% over the same period. Allan Rushforth, chief operating officer at Hyundai Motor Europe, said many consumers were being pushed into buying fuel-efficient cars in an effort to save cash, adding: \"The European car market is increasingly hard-wired into fiscal policy.\" Fulthorpe said many companies had decided to direct their marketing budgets toward the UK, rather than the more depressed markets in the eurozone, with very competitive rates of finance. He also said that compensation payments for mis-selling of payment protection insurance could have boosted sales. \"Anecdotally these are seen as windfall payments by people rather than part of their everyday budgeting.\" A spokesman for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in the UK said: \"The positive performance we've seen in the UK new car market this year has been driven by a range of market and buyer-specific factors, as well as the hard work of vehicle manufacturers and their dealer networks to attract motorists to the forecourts. These are difficult times for a number of European countries and there needs to be sustained, collective effort to promote economic growth and strengthen consumer confidence.\" The hardest hit manufacturer in May was France's Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn group, which is cutting 8,000 jobs and closing its Aulnay plant in Paris next year. Ford reported stable numbers for May but is shutting assembly plants in Southampton and Genk in Belgium as well as some Dagenham operations with the loss of 5,700 jobs. However, year-to-date deliveries at the Detroit-based company are down 12.8% in the EU. High-volume manufacturers dependent on European markets, such as Renault in France and Fiat in Italy, will continue to experience the most distress, analysts said. Fulthorpe said: \"If you have a manufacturing network geared up to supplying markets that are in decline for the seventh straight year, there is little that can insulate you. On the flip side, Volkswagen and some of the more obvious premium manufacturers - Jaguar, Daimler, BMW - aren't geared up for western markets in the same way. If China continues to grow, they will benefit.\" A study by business consultants AlixPartners showed that 58 of Europe's top 100 car plants are making losses. It predicted that sales of new cars in the EU will stagnate at around 12m vehicles per year for the foreseeable future.",

      "body": "<p>The slump in European car sales has reached a fresh nadir with the worst figures for May in 20 years, eroding manufacturers' faint hopes of a recovery after more than five years of decline.</p> <p>The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said demand for new cars in the European Union was down 5.9% on the same month last year.

      "bodyText": "As investors await the latest musings of US Federal Reserve boss Ben Bernanke on the central bank's bond buying programme, European markets have closed - mostly - higher. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 43.72 points or 0.69% higher at 6374.21 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.17% to 8229.51 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.02% higher at 16,197 \u2022 Spain's Ibex rose 0.54% to 8180 \u2022 In Athens the market ended 1.16% higher at 918.03 \u2022 But France's Cac bucked the trend, down 0.08% at 3860.55 In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.72% or 107 points higher. And with that, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Not really a surprise: Fitch has confirmed Switzerland's AAA credit rating with a stable outlook. The agency lists the reasons and they will probably provoke some envious glances from elsewhere: \u2022 The country has an advanced, diversified and wealthy economy, which is supported by a track record of low and stable inflation and macroeconomic stability despite the sluggish global recovery and eurozone crisis. \u2022 Public finances are significantly better than the 'AAA' median indicators.. The general government balance has been recording consistent surpluses since 2006, and was 0.6% of GDP in 2012. \u2022 Switzerland's strong external finances. The Swiss economy is a large net external creditor to the tune of 128% of GDP in 2012. The current account has also sustained a surplus for over two decades, with a five-year average of 7.9% of GDP, reflecting Switzerland's strong export-oriented economy and net international asset position. \u2022 Switzerland has strong institutions and governance which contribute to a stable political and economic environment. The authorities have been swift and decisive in responding to the 2009 recession. \u2022 The economy also benefits from a mid-level reserve currency status which enhances financing flexibility and has contributed to record low government borrowing costs. Cyprus has asked the eurozone for a complete rethink of the island's \u20ac10bn bailout, according to a letter obtained by the Financial Times. The newpaper reports (\u00a3) that president Nicos Anastasiades warned the country may not be able to meet the current terms of the rescue package because it has done more harm to the economy and banking system than expected. According to the FT, the letter says the restructuring of its two largest banks was implemented without careful preparation, leading to the capital held by many companies to be wiped out and prompting the capital controls which are still damaging the country. The newspaper reports: Mr Anastasiades has asked EU leaders to unwind the complex restructuring and partial merger of its two largest banks, which account for 80% of the domestic banking sector, backed by further eurozone loans. A senior eurozone official directly involved in the Cypriot talks said EU officials were \u201cpuzzled\u201d by the letter, adding finance ministers would discuss it at a regularly scheduled meeting Thursday but were unlikely to view it favourably. Ratings agency Fitch has warned of the potential risks to US banks if - or when - the US Federal Reserve ends its bond buying programme or raises rates. Although Fitch there are unlikely to be solvency issues, it said: The recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields and speculation surrounding possible changes in the Fed's bond buying program have highlighted the potential risks faced by U.S. banks in a rising rate environment, according to Fitch Ratings. A sustained increase in interest rates, potentially signaling an end to the prolonged low rate environment that has hampered bank margins, could have a meaningful impact on capital and bank earnings. We remain primarily focused on the adverse impact that rising rates could have on bank capital under the current proposed Basel III framework for U.S. banks. Unrealized gains on securities held on U.S. bank balance sheets have risen to historically high levels, potentially setting the stage for a reversal of gains and an ensuing erosion of capital levels should rate increases hit bond prices hard. This is especially relevant given banks' increased exposure to mortgage bonds in investment portfolios on both an absolute and proportional basis. In general, Fitch expects most banks' margins to expand along with rising rates. This view is incorporated in our ratings and outlook for the banking industry. Fitch does not believe the impact of rising rates will create solvency issues at U.S. banks. However, negative rating actions could emerge if we identify an absence of risk management practices commensurate with balance sheet strategies that could result in adverse impacts to capital and earnings as rates rise. European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso is the latest to express optimism about the current state of the eurozone. Speaking at the G8: Ahead of a meeting of eurozone finance minsters on Thursday, the European Commission's economic chief Olli Rehn has been speaking: Despite Spain's bad banking loans rising again (9.29), ministers continue to insist the worst could be over. Economy minister Luis de Guindos admitted Spanish banks were likely to have to find another \u20ac10bn in bad debt provisions. But echoing Monday's comments by finance minister Cristobal Montoro, he said recent data showed Spain's recession was almost over. According to Reuters, he told a financial conference in Santander: In the second quarter there has been a tipping point which suggests the recession could be ending....We saw the economy shrink by 0.5% in the first quarter, but this quarter it will be much closer to zero. After the fairly benign US inflation data, Wall Street has opened on a positive note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 53 points or 0.36% in early trading, while most European markets are managing to trade in positive territory. Of course the US Federal Reserve meeting is the effectively the key event for markets at the moment, and while it starts today, the crucial time will be tomorrow when it issues its statement and chairman Ben Bernanke speaks. Back in the US and as well as inflation (1.39) there have also been some housing figures. Housing starts rose 6.8% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 914,000, below expectations of around 950,000. But the overall trend shows the market remains relatively strong. Meanwhile a poll just out from Reuters shows 57 out of 70 equity analysts expect the US Federal Reserve to ease the pace of its quantitative easing programme before halting it completely. Most expect to see the Fed's $85bn a month bond buying programme will start being trimmed in the third or fourth quarter of this year. We should know more tomorrow, when Fed chairman Ben Bernanke updates the market after its latest meeting. Investors are hoping he will clarify the timetable for any easing of QE, having spooked the markets after his comments on 22 May suggested it could be coming to an end. Europe's shrinking car market continues to cast a shadow today, with analysts and top executives warning that the sector is suffering badly from the turmoil in the region. As explained in our opening post (see 7.54am for details and graphs), car sales fell to a 20-year low in May, with big falls in major markets such as Germany, France and Spain (and a 40% hit in Cyprus). Carlos Da Silva, analyst at IHS Automotive, dubbed the European market \"horrendous\", warning that the welcome rise in sales recorded in April was clearly \"nothing more than a bright spell\" that had now faded. Reuters reports that Allan Rushforth, chief operating officer at Hyundai Motor Europe, said many consumers are being pushed into buying fuel-efficient cars in an effort to save cash, adding: The European car market is increasingly hard-wired into fiscal policy. And here's a reminder of the sharp, steady fall in car sales over the last year: And that's a good moment to hand over to my colleague Nick Fletcher..... Just released... US inflation data, showing that the cost of living rose by 0.1% in May, compared with April. That small monthly rise follows two months of falling prices (monthly CPI fell 0.4% in April, and 0.2% in March). On an annual basis, America's Consumer Prices Index came in at +1.4%, barely half the 2.7% recorded in Britain early this morning (see 9.34am onwards). Core CPI (stripping out food and energy costs) rose by 0.2% during May. None of that really suggests that America's huge monetary stimulus packages are fuelling inflation, as Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider jokes: Greece's prime minister may have some explaining to do when he meets with officials from the country's lenders tonight. Antonis Samaras is due to hold talks with the Troika from 6pm local time (4pm BST). They will seek answers on Greece's privatisation programme, after the sale of its gas company failed last week. The closure of state broadcaster ERT may also be discussed -- as we reported this morning, they've already demanded answers from finance minister Yannis Stournaras (see 10.47am) Speaking of Germany, the latest opinion poll data shows that Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats are holding onto their lead over the Social Democrats, with three months until the country's general election. That undelines how Merkel has won steady support from her handling of the eurozone crisis at home. The Economist is hosting an online debate on Germany's role in the eurozone crisis, and you can contribute, and vote. The motion reads: Has Europe suffered from a lack of German leadership during the euro crisis? Zanny Minton Beddoes, the newspaper's economics editor, is moderating the debate. She asks whether Germany, the \"biggest creditor country in [the] debt crisis\" is playing the right role for its troubled region: She asks Has Europe benefitted or suffered from Germany's behaviour? Is Germany showing insufficient leadership or is it being too bossy? Has it behaved as a responsible leader or have German politicians been driven by short-sighted domestic considerations? The motion is being defended by Sony Kapoor of the Redefine thinktank, and opposed by Jacob Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute. Sony is currently leading with almost 80% of the votes, having argued that Germany have been obsessed with 'parochial' issues, failed to support necessary reforms and provided damaging leadership. But it's early days -- and you can vote and comment here. The second important development in Britain's banking sector this morning also revolves around the Co-operative Bank, and the collapse of its attempt to buy more than 600 branches from Lloyds. The head of the organisation that lost out to the Co-op, thwarted suiter Lord Levene, has told MPs that he believes the process was biased. In a letter, released this morning, Levene argued that Lloyds had leaned in favour of the Co-op, even though his NBNK group were offering more cash up front. Levene claimed that the UK government had interfered: We had been over the period receiving a number of messages indicating that there had been significant political involvement leading up to the original decisoin. Levene's evidence was published as Lloyds chief executive, Antonio Horta-Osorio,and chairman Sir Win Bischoff were grilled by the Treasury Select Committee this morning. MPs demanded to know why they had accepted an offer from the Co-op Bank, only for the deal to unravel when its capital shortfall became clear. Horta-Osorio confirmed that he had spoken to government ministers several times about the branch sale (the taxpayer owns 39% of Lloyds). Bischoff was adamant, though, that there had not been any poitical interference \u2013 argued that Co-op's offer looked like a better bid.... Here's the statement from the Serious Fraud Office. A former trader from Citi and UBS has been charged with eight counts of conspiracy to defraud by the Serious Fraud Office this morning, following an investigation into the Libor interest rate. Tom Hayes is the first person to be charged in the UK over Libor. Story to follow. It's all kicking off in Britain's banking sector this morning. First up, Moody's has just downgraded the Co-operative Bank's ratings following the rescue deal which forces losses on junior bond holders. Moody's warned that Co-op Bank may face further problems, as it slashed its rating by four notches from Ba3 to Caa1. The downgrade of the bank's senior ratings to Caa1 reflects a material risk that, particularly until completion of the recapitalisation plan, further burden sharing may be required at some point if these efforts to recapitalise and restructure the bank prove unsuccessful. The potential for burden-sharing involving senior creditors under that scenario is partly mitigated, from a rating perspective, by the possibility of some systemic support. Over in Greece, last night's high court decision has been met with muted bewilderment by the people it will affect most \u2013 staff at ERT, the public broadcaster whose closure sparked the crisis. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: The mood at ERT\u2019s headquarters, though palpably relieved, is also muted. The canteens that were doing a thriving business as protestors gathered outside the building have now been removed \u2013 perhaps the biggest single sign that passions have abated following the Council of State\u2019s eleventh hour ruling. But the complexity of the judgment has meant that the terrain is also far from clear. Media this morning is replete with reports that while the judgment is seen as nothing short of a victory, staff at the public broadcaster are also confused as to what the future holds for them. \u201cFrom 8am, ERT employees have been holding conferences in the building with the sole aim of interpreting the judgment,\u201d one reporter told Flash radio. \u201cTo be honest, there is a lot of confusion over what it all means.\u201d Meanwhile, in a development that not even his closest aides expected, the Greek finance minister Yiannis Stournaras has been called into emergency talks with visiting Troika missions chiefs now demanding to know what was agreed at last night\u2019s meeting of coalition leaders. Helena adds: The meeting comes against a backdrop of acceptance from both creditors at the EU, IMF and ECB and Greece that Athens is unlikely to meet the target of raking in \u20ac2.6bn through privatizations this year following the failed attempt to sell off the state-run natural gas corporation, DEPA, last week. Seperately, Theodora Oikonomides flags up that ERT broadcasts have not been restored yet, but might return tomorrow night: And as Kizbot points out in the comments below, the court's ruling will still mean that ERT closes and is replaced by a new entity, Nerit. It looks like a temporary stay of execution. The ZEW survey of German investors and analysts is out, and shows that optimism is rising. The Sentiment survey, which asks about future prospects, rose to 38.5 from 36.4 last month, beating expections. But the reading of current conditions actually fell, to 8.6 from 8.9 in May. Those interviewed remained rather cautious, predicting Europe's largest economy would only grow slowly this year. Nearly half predicted there would be \"no significant economic impulses\" over the next six months. Carsten Brzeski of ING, though, was optimistic, saying (via Reuters): Today\u2019s ZEW index adds evidence that the German economy is regaining momentum. Recently, doubts about the strength of the German economy have emerged again. Several international institutions revised downwards their growth forecasts for this year, expecting almost no growth any longer. In our view, however, the German economy could surprise again. In fact, hard data available so far have been very promising: at the beginning of the second quarter, industrial production surged, the construction sector more than offset the entire output losses caused by the harsh winter weather and exports regained momentum. Only private consumption seems to have taken a breather. Several commentators point out that today's rise in inflation marks the end of Sir Mervyn King's tenure at the Bank of England. The governor's later years were dominated by above-target inflation, at a time where wages were squeezed hard. This chart from the Office for National Statistics shows which items rose, or fell, in cost in May 2013 compared with a year ago - driving up CPI inflation to 2.7%. Transport prices rose by 0.4% between April and May, the ONS said, including a 22% rise in air fares. Petrol and diesel prices fell, though, it added. Clothing and footware prices rose by 1.2% month-on-month, which the ONS pinned on an increase in garments, \"particularly women\u2019s outerwear\". UK inflation has risen again, with the Consumer Prices Index coming in at 2.7% year-on-year in May, up from April's 2.4%. That means the cost of living continues to rise above the Bank of England's target of 2%. The Office for National Statistics attributed the rise to higher air fares, motor fuel, clothing and footwear -- all higher than a year ago. Core CPI (stripping out changes in the cost of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco) also rose, to 2.2%, up from 2%. Reaction to follow Toxic loans in Spain's troubled banking sector are welling up again, according to new data this morning. The proportion of underperforming loans in the Spanish banking sector rose to 10.9% in April, a jump in March's 10.5%. Confirmation that Spain's banking problems haven't gone away, as its ongoing recession continues to hurt businesses, property owners and individual borrowers. UPDATE: Spain's bad loan levels did fall earlier this year when banks were able to shunt some non-performing loans off their balance sheets into the country's new bad bank. Our correspondent in Madrid, Giles Tremlett, points out that trend is now reversing: A further \u20ac4bn of bad loans appeared last month. At that rate we will be back to pre bad bank levels before the end of the year. If Mario Draghi hoped to weaken the euro a little by hinting at more ECB action this morning, he'll be disappointed. The single currency just nudged its highest level against the US dollar since February 20th There's some talk that this morning's ZEW survey (of investor confidence in Germany) will provide a decent number. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has declared that the ECB has more weapons in its monetary locker. Speaking in Jerusalem this morning, Draghi said the ECB was \"ready to act\" where needed. He pointed to various \"non-standard\" monetary policy tool, such as hitting banks with negative deposit rates in an effort to force more lending. Here's the key quote (the full speech is online here). There are numerous other measures \u2013 standard interest rate policy and non-standard measures \u2013 that we can deploy and that we will deploy if circumstances warrant. At the same time, I have also made clear that some of those measures may have unintended consequences. This does not mean that they should not be used, but it does mean that we need to be aware of those consequences and manage them appropriately. We will look with an open mind at these measures that are especially effective in our institutional setup and that fall within our mandate. It's a more dynamic tone than we heard from Draghi at the last ECB press conference two weeks ago, although he's not really announcing anything new. The euro did fall during his speech as investors (or computer trading algorithms?) anticipated more easing, but has now recovered to around $1.336 against the US dollar. Draghi was addressing a conference to mark the departure of veteran Bank of Israel governor Stanley Fischer. With Mervyn King leaving the Bank of England next week, it's all change in the central bank world.... Some interesting economic news coming up today, including new readings of the cost of living on both sides of the Atlantic. \u2022 UK inflation for May: 9.30am BST \u2022 UK producer prices for May: 9.30am BST \u2022 ZEW survey of economic sentiment in Germany: 10am BST/11am CEST \u2022 US inflation for May: 1.30pm And here's a photo of the crowds in Syntagma Square last night as left-wing leader Alexis Tsipras gave a speech attacking the government over the ERT debacle. Plenty of disquiet in Greece.... A quick catch-up on the situation in Greece for anyone who missed last night's liveblog. The closure of Greek state broadcaster ERT took another twist when the country's highest court ruled that it must continue to operate a service until its replacement is operational. The ruling cheered campaigners who have pushed for ERT to keep running. However, it still means the broadcaster will be closed this summer. Nick Malkoutzis of eKathimerini summed it up best on Twitter overnight: The news came as the country's coalition leaders held crunch talks in Athens. Negotiations clearly didn't go too well, as a further meeting has been called for Wednesday. PASOK's Evangelos Venizelos and Fotis Kouvelis of Democratic Left spoke to the press late last night - here's the details: Venizelos said the court ruling had \u201cvindicated\u201d his party and hinted at a cabinet reshuffle. He said: The talks were about ERT, but the main issue is for the government to operate as a real coalition, not with New Democracy just tolerating its partners. Kouvelis made similar noises, and criticised prime minister Antonis Samaras (of New Democracy) for his high-handed approach to closing ERT, But finance minister Yannis Stournaras said the government's priority was \"for radical reforms to continue\". That clearly includes replacing ERT with a new state broadcaster which would employ much fewer people. This chart from the Association of European Carmakers shows how demand for vehicles varied widely across the EU in May The sharpest fall actually came in Romania (-47%), followed by Cyprus -- where just 632 new cars (-41%) were registered last month as the country adjusted to life as a bailed out entity governed by capital controls. The full release from the ACEA is here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. We start with another dose of bad news from Europe's auto sector -- sales have tumbled to their lowest level in 20 years, denting hopes that carmakers' fortunes might revive soon. The Association of European Carmakers reported that car sales slumped by 5.9% across the EU in May (compared with the previous year) to 1,042m vehicles. That's the smallest number, in absolute terms, since May 1993. ACEA explained: Five months into the year, a total of 5,070,840 new cars were registered in the region, or 6.8% less than in the first five months of 2012. The data showed sharp falls in demand in many key European markets -- new car sales fell 10.4% in France, 9.9% in Germany, and 8% in Italy. While in Cyprus, sales crashed by 41.4% -- a stark example of the consequences of its traumatic bailout deal and the capital controls that prevent people withdrawing large sums of money from the bank. The UK fared better, though, posting 11% growth in sales in May. The figures are a blow to the industry, because April's figures had shown a year-on-year rise in sales. May's data, though, suggests the downturn has continued. That underlines the weak consumer spending patterns in Europe, where the eurozone has already been in recession for six quarters. France's Peugeot fared particularly badly in May, with sales dropping by 13.2% year-on-year. That comes as the company pushes on with a plan to cut thousands of jobs and close a French factory in an effort to revive its fortunes. GM saw its sales dip by 11.3%, while Ford \u2013 which has already closed factories and cut staff hours \u2013 did better, posting flat sales.

Although Fitch there are unlikely to be solvency issues, it said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields and speculation surrounding possible changes in the Fed's bond buying program have highlighted the potential risks faced by U.S. banks in a rising rate environment, according to Fitch Ratings. A sustained increase in interest rates, potentially signaling an end to the prolonged low rate environment that has hampered bank margins, could have a meaningful impact on capital and bank earnings.</p> <p>We remain primarily focused on the adverse impact that rising rates could have on bank capital under the current proposed Basel III framework for U.S. banks. Unrealized gains on securities held on U.S. bank balance sheets have risen to historically high levels, potentially setting the stage for a reversal of gains and an ensuing erosion of capital levels should rate increases hit bond prices hard. This is especially relevant given banks' increased exposure to mortgage bonds in investment portfolios on both an absolute and proportional basis.</p> <p>In general, Fitch expects most banks' margins to expand along with rising rates. This view is incorporated in our ratings and outlook for the banking industry. Fitch does not believe the impact of rising rates will create solvency issues at U.S. banks. However, negative rating actions could emerge if we identify an absence of risk management practices commensurate with balance sheet strategies that could result in adverse impacts to capital and earnings as rates rise.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51c07711e4b080cec4568d21\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-18T15:04:49.879Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso is the latest to express optimism about the current state of the eurozone.

      "bodyText": "Banks were better but miners missed out as leading shares moved higher ahead of Wednesday's US Federal Reserve meeting. The FTSE 100 finished 43.72 points higher at 6374.21 as investors awaited comments from Fed chairman Ben Bernanke which they hoped would clarify its intentions regarding its $85bn a month bond buying programme. Central bank actions to stimulate the global economy have been supporting the markets for months, but comments in May from Bernanke suggesting an end could be in sight sent shivers through investors. As well as the anticipation for Bernanke's press conference, there was early talk that China may ease its policy by cutting the reserve requirement ratio - the amount of capital banks have to set aside in case of financial trouble - in the next day or so. New comments from Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, that it was \"ready to act\" where needed also helped sentiment. Among the banks, HSBC ended 14.5p higher at 696p after Citigroup raised its recommendation from neutral to buy. It said: A potential beneficiary of rising rates, and an attractive income stock, we upgrade HSBC [with a] target price of 770p. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 7p to 323p and Lloyds Banking Group was lifted 0.88p to 62.18p. Whitbread was the top riser in the FTSE 100. The Costa Coffee and Premier Inn business jumped 106p to \u00a330.31 after a well-received trading statement. Easyjet added 27p to \u00a312.79 on news of an $11bn Airbus order. The deal needs shareholder approval but is likely to face opposition from founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou. Vodafone climbed 1.65p to 184.35p despite US group Liberty Global making an offer for its bid target Kabel Deutschland, raising the prospect of a takeover battle. RSA Insurance ended 2.6p higher at 120.4p, lifted by news that Credit Suisse has moved from neutral to outperform and raised its price target from 125p to 138p. The bank said: Having been a long-term neutral on RSA, our decision to turn more positive reflects our belief that earnings are poised to improve following what has been an extended period of stagnation. But miners were heading lower as metal prices fell ahead of the Fed news, and on continuing worries about China's economic growth. Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation fell 10.7p to 229.6p while Antofagasta dropped 17.5p to 879p. Aggreko lost 39p to \u00a317.52 as the temporary power supply company said it was on track to meet first half expectations although trading remained subdued. Last year the company issued two profit warnings, but now says forecasts for the year are unchanged with a pickup in the second half expected. Security group G4S, where Bill Gates was recently revealed as a shareholder, dipped 3.1p to 241.7p after Goldman Sachs issued a sell recommendation and cut its target price from 200p to 194p. The move was made to take into account recent movements in emerging market currencies, and has led to the bank reducing its earnings estimate for G4S by 3% for 2013.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK inflation rose by a sharper-than-expected 2.7% in May, driven higher by the cost of air travel, fuel and clothing. The increase followed a seven-month low of 2.4% in April, according to data from the Office for National Statistics, and puts more pressure on household finances. Air fares increased by 22% between April and May, compared with 1.4% over the same period in 2012. The increase was largely related to the different timing of Easter \u2013 when prices rise \u2013 this year. Petrol and diesel prices both fell, but by less than a year ago, while clothing and footwear prices rose by 1.2%. Economists had forecast a smaller rise in the consumer price index (CPI) to 2.6%. Annual inflation has been running persistently above the Bank of England's 2% target for more than three years. Bank policymakers have made it clear that they will take a flexible approach to inflation targeting if the broader economic picture requires it, potentially paving the way for more quantitative easing \u2013 pumping cash into the economy by acquiring sovereign debt from financial institutions \u2013 despite above-target inflation. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the May inflation data served as a reminder that weak consumer spending was holding back growth. \"The ongoing erosion of spending power from rising prices will continue to act as a brake on economic recovery,\" he said. Inflation continues to outpace pay growth, which was just 0.9% excluding bonuses in the three months to April. With bonuses included, it was 1.3%. \"Real pay has been falling continually since late 2009, which has been one of the factors causing the economic recovery to have been disappointingly weak,\" Williamson added. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said CPI inflation was likely to rise further in the coming months, peaking at just above 3% in the summer. CPIH, the new measure of consumer price inflation which includes owner-occupier costs, rose to 2.5% from 2.2% in April. A spokesman for the Treasury said: \"Inflation is down by almost a half from its peak of 5.2% [in September 2011]. At the same time, to help families with the cost of living, the government has: increased the tax-free personal allowance to \u00a310,000, which will take 2.7 million people out of income tax altogether and save a typical taxpayer over \u00a3700; and frozen fuel duty which has kept petrol prices 13p per litre lower than they would otherwise have been.\"",
