      "bodyText": "Hundreds of jobs could be cut if an \u00a311bn merger of two of Scotland\u2019s biggest companies \u2013 Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management \u2013 goes ahead. Talks between the companies about a merger were revealed at the weekend and a tie-up could be confirmed as soon as Monday, creating the second biggest fund manager in Europe and the largest in the UK. In a joint statement confirming the talks, the financial companies said the tie-up would boost profits by creating significant synergies and cost savings. Most of the cost savings are expected to come from eliminating any overlap of back-office operations \u2013 such as IT \u2013 by cutting jobs and closing offices. Sky News, which revealed the potential merger, reported that the companies could look to cut as much as \u00a3200m in annual costs. Standard Life employs 6,300 people worldwide, including 5,500 in the UK, while Aberdeen has 2,800 employees, including 1,500 in the UK. Sources close to the deal insisted at the weekend that Standard Life and Aberdeen were looking to merge in order to grow, not shrink, and create a flagship business for Scotland. They said that job losses could be offset by new opportunities created by the expansion of the enlarged company. Standard Life and Aberdeen are understood to have already held talks with the Scottish government about the proposed deal. The two companies are exploring an all-share merger that would create a business overseeing pensions and savings worth \u00a3660bn. They hope to create an investment group with the clout to take on US giants such as BlackRock and Vanguard. Standard Life shareholders would own 66.7% of the combined company while Aberdeen shareholders would get 33.3%. The two companies claim the deal would create an investment group with strong brands and offers customers more choice. Standard Life and Aberdeen have reiterated their commitment to active management \u2013 where fund managers actively pick stocks and bonds. Active management has come under pressure from the growing popularity of cheaper index-tracking funds and an increase in costs caused by the introduction of stricter regulatory rules since the financial crisis Faced with the same pressures, UK rival Henderson Global Investors recently agreed to take over Denver-based firm Janus Capital, creating a fund house with assets of more than $320bn (\u00a3260bn). Analysts expect middle and back-office roles to be cut as a result of the deal, but a number of senior investment managers have left Henderson amid concerns over cultural differences between the two firms. Cultural differences will be less of an issue for two Scottish businesses, but any office closures and job losses will trigger concerns north of the border. Standard Life employs 5,000 people in Scotland, mostly at its head office in Edinburgh, while Aberdeen says just under half of its 1,500 UK workforce is based in Scotland. Standard Life also has a customer service office in Glasgow with 200 people and another office in London in the Gherkin skyscraper, while its rival is based in Aberdeen and has offices in Edinburgh, London, Bristol and Jersey. The combined group would be run by co-chief executives \u2013 Standard Life boss Keith Skeoch and his counterpart at Aberdeen Martin Gilbert. The Standard Life chairman Sir Gerry Grimstone would chair the new board, while Aberdeen\u2019s chairman Simon Troughton would become deputy chairman. It is likely to be based in Edinburgh and one name being considered for the enlarged company is Standard Aberdeen, although this is yet to be confirmed. Under the terms of the deal, Aberdeen shareholders would receive 0.757 new Standard Life shares for each Aberdeen share. The planned tie-up would need to be approved by the shareholders of both companies \u2013 who have reacted positively so far \u2013 and competition authorities. Gilbert has been on the lookout for a deal for Aberdeen for some time. The company suffered outflows of \u00a310.5bn from its funds in the final three months of last year, taking its total assets to \u00a3302.7bn. Gilbert said \u201cinvestor sentiment stalled\u201d following Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president. Aberdeen specialises in emerging markets and has struggled since investor interest cooled in recent years, prompting Gilbert to freeze salaries and cut other costs. Standard Life has fared better, and recently posted a 9% rise in operating profit before tax to \u00a3723m for 2016. The Brexit vote in June \u201ctriggered very substantial [fund] outflows for the industry\u201d, Skeoch said, but the impact on Standard Life was modest. Its assets increased 16% to \u00a3357.1bn over the year. However, its flagship investment fund, Global Asset Return Strategies, suffered as investors pulled out \u00a34.3bn.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In the long and winding road of Greek debt drama, disappointment and hope have been the alternating emotions that every government has faced. With the nation\u2019s crisis no nearer to being resolved than when it erupted seven years ago, negotiations with creditors at another critical juncture and Europe engulfed in uncertainty, the need for hope has never been greater. \u201cWhat Greece needs is a shock of growth,\u201d the country\u2019s deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis told the Guardian ahead of a crucial cabinet meeting on Monday. \u201cWe will meet to discuss a new growth strategy that will focus solely on boosting investment and reducing unemployment to pre-crisis levels, that is to say 8% in the next 10 years.\u201d The leftist government in Athens is acutely aware that the public mood is darkening. On Sunday, six out of 10 Greeks said they did not believe the crisis would be over in the next decade, according to research released by the Dianeosis thinktank. Unemployment at 23% \u2013 and close to 50% amongst Greek youth \u2013 is by far the greatest obstacle to optimism. \u201cOf course no one knows what will happen in Europe after Brexit and after the election of [US president] Trump,\u201d said Dragasakis, speaking on the sidelines of the annual Delphi economic forum. \u201cBut the positive scenario for Greece is also positive for Europe. And for that to happen we have to say \u2018enough with austerity\u2019.\u201d In navigating the country\u2019s economic collapse, every one of Athens\u2019 post-crisis governments has at some point attempted to change the narrative by diverting attention to development and growth. But the latest shift comes amid evidence that prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s two-party administration has gone a step further, approaching the World Bank for a \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.6bn) loan to finance employment policies and programmes. The move would highlight the desperation of a government tackling ever-growing poverty rates. Last week, the Cologne Institute for Economic Research said poverty in thrice-bailed out Greece had jumped 40% between 2008 and 2015, by far the biggest leap of any European country. Tsipras has been told he will have to enforce labour market reforms and further pension and income tax cuts if Greece is to realistically achieve a primary surplus of 3.5% \u2013 before interest payments are taken into account \u2013 once its current rescue programme expires in August 2018. The country faces debt repayments of over \u20ac7bn in July and with its coffers near empty would be unable to avert default \u2013 and inevitable euro exit \u2013 if additional loans weren\u2019t forthcoming. The prospect of more cuts, when pensions have already been slashed 12 times and some retirees are surviving on little more than \u20ac300 a month, has exacerbated the sense of gloom in the eurozone\u2019s weakest member state. \u201cWe will have to compromise,\u201d Dragasakis admitted. \u201cEven if such demands are totally irrational,\u201d he said, adding that Greece\u2019s real problem was that it was primarily caught up in an ugly dispute between its lenders over what to do with a debt load close to 180% of GDP. The IMF has projected the pile will reach an \u201cexplosive\u201d 275% of output if not relieved \u2013 a move that Germany, the biggest provider of bailout funds, refuses steadfastly to agree to. \u201cIt is why we have not completed the review,\u201d said Dragasakis of the progress report Athens must conclude to secure further assistance. The Greek government has been accused of deliberately delaying implementation of reforms. \u201cThis government won\u2019t deliver reforms because it doesn\u2019t believe in them,\u201d said the centre-right main opposition leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis at the Delphi forum. As in antiquity, when kings, warriors and philosophers descended on Delphi at times of uncertainty to consult the Pythia, or prophetess, about their future, politicians, policy gurus, economists and academics gather annually at the place once regarded as the centre of the world to debate Greece\u2019s plight. \u201cWhat we need is a masterplan and a vision to get out of this crisis,\u201d said Nikos Xydakis, the former European affairs minister who is now parliamentary spokesman for the ruling Syriza party. \u201cA masterplan in financial terms but also a vision for a new identity of Greeks once this crisis ends.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "John Lewis and Waitrose owner set to reduce staff bonus", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The owner of John Lewis and Waitrose is poised to cut the annual bonus it pays staff to the lowest level since the 1950s due to the pressure on retailers. The John Lewis Partnership, which is owned by its staff, is expected to announce a bonus of between 6% and 7% of workers\u2019 annual salary. This would be a cut from a 10% bonus last year \u2013 when the average payout was \u00a31,585 for its 91,500 staff \u2013 and the fourth year in a row that John Lewis has cut the award. It will be the lowest bonus since 1954, when it stood at 4% of pay. The cut in the bonus reflects the tough retail environment. The business, which covers department stores, supermarkets and online shopping, is expected to report a 10% fall in underlying annual profits for last year. John Lewis staff own the company through a trust and take a share of its profits. The bonus, which is handed out to everyone at the group, from the chairman to shopfloor staff, has fallen significantly in recent years. It amounted to 17% of pay in 2013, 15% in 2014, 11% in 2015, and 10% last year. The group started paying bonuses in cash in 1969. Previously it awarded shares, share promises, or a mixture of cash and stock. The first bonus was paid at the end of the first world war. The payout was suspended during the second world war and the early 1950s recession, and peaked at 24% of salary in the 1980s. The highest payout in recent years was 18% in 2011. Despite enjoying strong trading over Christmas, the partnership warned in January that the annual bonus would be significantly lower than last year. Like other high street retailers, John Lewis stores have been affected by the growing popularity of online shopping. Waitrose is struggling against fierce competition from other grocers and recently unveiled plans for job cuts and six store closures. The group is also likely to take a hit from the post-Brexit slump in sterling because it will increase the cost of importing goods. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chair of the partnership, described sterling as \u201cthe dog that hasn\u2019t really barked\u201d. He noted that the weaker pound \u2013 down about 20% since last June\u2019s Brexit vote \u2013 would start affecting British businesses this year, as most buy currency six months to a year in advance. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: \u201cThe John Lewis board is likely to be mindful of the fact that underlying profits look to have fallen by over 10% last year, despite a decent Christmas, and with trading in the new year off to a sluggish start, it will have to allow for the fact that profits will probably fall again this year as well \u2013 hence the significant pressure on the bonus that it flagged on 12 January.\u201d Bubb expects pretax profits to rise slightly from \u00a3306m to \u00a3310m, due to a pension funding boost, but trading profits are likely to be just over 10% down, at \u00a3431m. The new managing director of the John Lewis department stores, Paula Nickolds, last month announced plans to cut as many as 800 jobs in its customer restaurants and store administration, its biggest ever round of redundancies.",

      "body": "<p>The owner of John Lewis and Waitrose is poised to cut the annual bonus it pays staff to the lowest level since the 1950s due to the pressure on retailers. <br></p> <p>The John Lewis Partnership, which is owned by its staff, is expected to announce a bonus of between 6% and 7% of workers\u2019 annual salary. This would be a cut from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/john-lewis-waitrose-staff-bonus-falls-again\">10% bonus last year</a> \u2013 when the average payout was \u00a31,585 for its 91,500 staff \u2013 and the fourth year in a row that John Lewis has cut the award. It will be the lowest bonus since 1954, when it stood at 4% of pay.</p> <p>The cut in the bonus reflects the tough retail environment. The business, which covers department stores, supermarkets and online shopping, is expected to report a 10% fall in underlying annual profits for last year.</p> <p>John Lewis staff own the company through a trust and take a share of its profits. The bonus, which is handed out to everyone at the group, from the chairman to shopfloor staff, has fallen significantly in recent years. It amounted to 17% of pay in 2013, 15% in 2014, 11% in 2015, and 10% last year.</p> <p>The group started paying bonuses in cash in 1969. Previously it awarded shares, share promises, or a mixture of cash and stock. The first bonus was paid at the end of the first world war. The payout was suspended during the second world war and the early 1950s recession, and peaked at 24% of salary in the 1980s. The highest payout in recent years was 18% in 2011.</p> <p>Despite enjoying strong trading over Christmas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/12/john-lewis-cut-staff-bonus-market-waitrose-christmas\">the partnership warned in January that the annual bonus would be significantly lower than last year</a>. Like other high street retailers, John Lewis stores have been affected by the growing popularity of online shopping. Waitrose is struggling against fierce competition from other grocers and recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/08/hundreds-of-waitrose-jobs-may-go-as-retailer-plans-six-store-closures\">unveiled plans for job cuts and six store closures</a>.</p> <p>The group is also likely to take a hit from the post-Brexit slump in sterling because it will increase the cost of importing goods. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chair of the partnership, described sterling as \u201cthe dog that hasn\u2019t really barked\u201d. He noted that the weaker pound \u2013 down about 20% since last June\u2019s Brexit vote \u2013 would start affecting British businesses this year, as most buy currency six months to a year in advance. </p> <p>Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: \u201cThe John Lewis board is likely to be mindful of the fact that underlying profits look to have fallen by over 10% last year, despite a decent Christmas, and with trading in the new year off to a sluggish start, it will have to allow for the fact that profits will probably fall again this year as well \u2013 hence the significant pressure on the bonus that it flagged on 12 January.\u201d</p> <p>Bubb expects pretax profits to rise slightly from \u00a3306m to \u00a3310m, due to a pension funding boost, but trading profits are likely to be just over 10% down, at \u00a3431m.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/25/john-lewis-paula-nickolds-chief-executive-first-female\">The new managing director of the John Lewis department stores, Paula Nickolds</a>, last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/23/john-lewis-to-cut-800-jobs\">announced plans to cut as many as 800 jobs</a> in its customer restaurants and store administration, its biggest ever round of redundancies.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Philip Hammond stands up to give his budget on Wednesday, this is what you are likely to hear: economic growth has been, and will be, stronger than expected after the Brexit vote. Defying all the doomsayers who said a vote to leave could prompt a recession, consumers carried on spending and businesses continued to expand. The picture for the public finances is also looking rosier compared with Hammond\u2019s maiden autumn statement in November. Back then, the fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), overhauled its forecasts to show that the impact of the Brexit vote on the economy would force the government to borrow \u00a3122bn more than hoped over coming years. Less than four months on, healthy tax receipts mean the government has not borrowed as much as previously feared to fund its spending over this financial year. In other words, when the chancellor presents what is to be the last spring budget before it moves to the autumn, he will be in the rare position of unveiling an improvement in the public finances. That is quite a contrast to the recent trend of confessing on budget day that the deficit will be higher than previously thought. This all makes for rather nice headlines and will no doubt prompt Hammond to utter soothing words about how the UK can embark on Brexit negotiations from a firm footing. But here\u2019s what the chancellor will not tell you: living costs have gone up and will continue to do so. The poorest will be hit hardest as the cost of essentials such as food and heating take a growing chunk out of already tight family budgets. Wages will struggle to match rises in inflation and the government\u2019s benefit cuts mean that incomes will fall for the poorest people in Britain. In short, unless the government does something significant to improve living standards this week, inequality will start rising again. The interesting forecasts to watch for on budget day will be what the OBR thinks will happen to inflation, real wages and household spending over coming years. Those projections will give a far better picture of how policy decisions and the economic backdrop are very likely to affect people\u2019s day-to-day lives than the deficit projections and GDP estimates. The picture will be completed on Thursday, when the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) conducts its traditional post-budget number crunching to spell out what it all means for different income groups. At that point it becomes much harder for Hammond and his fellow ministers to hide behind the happy headlines of faster growth and lower borrowing. That is because the kind of distributional analysis by the IFS and other thinktanks lays bare how a change such as raising an income tax threshold can mean a windfall for some but make no difference to others. It also exposes how benefit changes will raise or reduce the incomes of those claiming them while having no impact on those who do not; thereby potentially widening or narrowing inequalities. Such analysis can also highlight how there is no such thing as one inflation rate for everyone. Living costs tend to rise at different rates depending on how rich or poor someone is. Based on what we have seen so far in those three areas of tax policy, benefits and inflation, the government\u2019s pledge to create a more equal society is way off track. There are some positive policies that warrant a mention. The higher minimum wage, dubbed the national living wage by the government, has helped low paid workers. The push for more apprenticeships should get more young people on to decent career paths. More childcare provision has helped parents. But the bigger picture is that in the middle of a rise in living costs, welfare cuts are piling on extra pressure and tax changes are helping the wealthy more than the poor. A study by the IFS before the budget found that if welfare cuts are implemented as planned, the poorest 15% of the population are likely to have lower incomes in five years\u2019 time as a freeze in benefits and universal credit \u2013 which on average will be less than the benefits it replaces \u2013 take their toll. Part of the Treasury\u2019s response to that report was to highlight how it was \u201ccutting taxes for millions of working people\u201d. There have indeed been successive rises over recent years to the tax-free personal allowance \u2013 the amount someone can earn without having to pay income tax. But it is a costly thing to do and the gains have disproportionately gone to households higher up the income scale. Finally there is the matter of inflation. The consumer prices index (CPI) puts UK inflation at 1.8%. That is low by historical standards but still the highest rate we have seen for more than two years. Inflation is expected to rise further this year, pushed up by higher global oil prices and by the effects of the pound\u2019s devaluation since the Brexit vote. A weaker currency increases the cost of the UK\u2019s many imports, such as food ingredients and metals. But that headline figure is only part of the story. Inflation is a measure of how one big basket of goods and services has changed in price over time. The basket is designed to reflect spending patterns but it will never truly reflect any one person\u2019s actual spending. So when rising food prices drive a rise in inflation, as is currently the case, poorer households will feel that more acutely because they spend a bigger proportion of their money on food. The poorest fifth of the population spend \u00a31 in every \u00a36 on food\u2013 for the richest fifth it is just \u00a31 in every \u00a312, according to an analysis of official figures by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. So given that spending patterns differ, it follows that the cost of living rises at different rates for different people. In his book, The Truth About Inflation, the economist Paul Donovan highlights this and what he sees as the \u201cinflation inequality\u201d that has accompanied a rise in income inequality. His calculations reveal a striking contrast between the rises in costs faced by the richest 20% and poorest 20% in a number of advanced economies in recent decades. In the UK, between 1997 and the beginning of 2017, prices for the richest fifth rose 40% but for the poorest fifth they increased by 51%. As the cost of food and other essentials start to pick up again, a government vowing to help everyone would do well to consider Donovan\u2019s evidence on inflation inequality. \u201cThe past two or three decades have seen inflation rates for lower-income groups in society rise faster than inflation rates for higher income people,\u201d he says in the book. \u201cPut simply, it is cheaper to be rich than it is to be poor.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s commitment to tackling high-end money laundering through the City of London is under serious scrutiny after it emerged that regulators appear to have waved through an $800m bank transfer to a convicted criminal as the proceeds from one of the most corrupt deals in the history of the oil industry. A joint investigation by the Observer and journalists from Finance Uncovered, a non-profit organisation based in London, has discovered that prosecutors in Milan believe two payments of $400m each were wired through JP Morgan in London as the spoils of a huge deal to develop a Nigerian oilfield involving Shell, its joint venture partner the Italian oil giant Eni, and the government in Abuja. More than half the money was converted into bags of bribe cash via bureaux de change in Nigeria, while tens of millions was wired to buy a private jet and armoured cars in the US, according to documents compiled by the prosecutors. But ordinary citizens of Nigeria have not seen a penny from the deal \u2013 which, it is alleged, was partly negotiated by two ex-MI6 officers hired by Shell as \u201cbusiness and investment advisers\u201d. The astonishing allegations have been made by an Italian prosecutor, Fabio de Pasquale, whose previous scalps include former Italian leader Silvio Berlusconi. De Pasquale and his team have spent more than two years following the money trail surrounding the murky sale of Nigeria\u2019s prized Oil Prospecting Licence 245 (OPL 245), a huge block off the coast of west Africa estimated to contain 9.3bn barrels of crude: enough to power the continent for seven years. Oil giants from the west, China and Russia have coveted its riches for years. But Shell and Eni eventually prevailed, paying $1.3bn to the Nigerian government to secure the field in 2011. However, within days the bulk of the money was transferred through JP Morgan in London to a convicted Nigerian money launderer \u2013 a man with whom both Shell and Eni had been negotiating. \u201cThe UK authorities have some serious explaining to do,\u201d said Barnaby Pace, a campaigner with the anti-corruption watchdog Global Witness, which has investigated this case for several years. De Pasquale has carried out raids on Eni offices in Italy and Shell\u2019s headquarters in The Hague that have yielded tens of thousands of documents and emails. Last month he requested that an Italian court charge 10 individuals, including five high-ranking executives from Eni, with corruption-related offences. Shell, as a corporate entity, was also included in the request, which will be considered by a court in Milan next month. Shell, Eni and all the executives named by De Pasquale strongly deny the allegations. De Pasquale has also formally warned four former Shell employees, who allegedly played significant roles in securing the deal, that they could be subject to separate proceedings. Among them are Guy Colegate and John Copleston, identified by De Pasquale in legal documents as having \u201cpreviously worked for MI6\u201d. Copleston was a \u201cstrategic investment adviser\u201d at Shell who, as the UK\u2019s former intelligence representative in Nigeria, had nurtured contacts at the highest levels of the country\u2019s military and government. Colegate worked as a \u201cbusiness adviser\u201d, compiling regular intelligence briefings on the main actors in the OPL 245 negotiations. As Shell eyed OPL 245, both the CIA and the Foreign Office were aware that Vladimir Putin and Russia were considering trying to snatch Nigerian assets from the west. The OPL 245 licence had proved particularly elusive. In 1998, Nigeria\u2019s then oil minister, Dan Etete, had awarded it to a shady new company, Malabu Oil and Gas, in which, it later emerged, he held a significant stake. But after a new president came to power, Malabu lost the licence and it was assigned to Shell. Later the position reversed and Shell began legal proceedings against the Nigerian government. Etete was convicted in a Paris court in 2007 for his part in a separate money-laundering scandal. But this did not appear to deter Shell and Eni from continuing to court him at luxury hotels in Europe and Nigeria. After one lunch with Etete in 2009 to discuss his asking price for OPL 245, it is reported that Copleston copied Colegate on an email to say it had gone well, helped along by \u201clots of iced champagne\u201d. In 2010, negotiations swung Shell\u2019s way when Goodluck Jonathan, an ally of Etete\u2019s, became Nigeria\u2019s president. The following year, the $1.3bn deal was struck, with Malabu entitled to $1.1bn and the Nigerian government a $210m \u201csignature fee\u201d. Shell and Eni paid the money directly to the Nigerian government. A fixer involved in the deal described this approach as putting a \u201ccondom\u201d between the buyer and seller so that at no point would Shell or Eni make direct payments to Malabu or Etete, who was officially recognised as a criminal. But in May 2011, days after the Nigerian government received the money, its officials instructed JP Morgan to transfer the $1.1bn to an account in Switzerland. At this point red flags should have been raised in London. Under money-laundering regulations, banks are required to raise Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) for highly unusual transactions, especially involving what are called \u201cpolitically exposed persons\u201d such as Etete. These reports are raised confidentially with the UK Financial Investigations Unit, which in 2011 was part of the Home Office\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca). Banks are forbidden from confirming whether they have raised SARs, and both JP Morgan and the National Crime Agency \u2013 Soca\u2019s successor \u2013 have declined to comment on the matter. However, a source indicated that JP Morgan had raised an SAR as soon as it received the request from Nigeria. It is understood that the bank would not have proceeded without a green light from Soca. Well-placed sources offer three possible explanations for why the UK authorities allowed the transfer to go through. Either they saw no problem with it; or they were aware of the money\u2019s provenance but, because the Nigerian government itself saw no corruption, there was little that could be done to secure evidence for a freezing order; or they wanted to track how the funds were disbursed to help gain intelligence. Whatever the explanation, the transfer immediately ran into difficulties. BSI Lugano, a Swiss bank, rejected the payment, citing Etete\u2019s money-laundering conviction. In August, JP Morgan then made a second attempt via a Lebanese bank to pay the money to Malabu, but this too was rejected. However, a fortnight later the bank was able to transfer the money, in separate tranches of $400m to two Nigerian banks. Where all of it ended up will probably never be known. De Pasquale alleges that President Jonathan received some of the money, but he denies the claim. Colegate did not respond to requests for comment. Attempts to reach Copleston were unsuccessful. It was not possible to contact Etete, while Eni declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Shell said: \u201cBased on our review of the prosecutor\u2019s file and our understanding of the facts, we don\u2019t believe a request for indictment is justified and we are confident that this will be determined in the next stages of the proceedings. We continue to take this matter seriously and cooperate with the authorities.\u201d Asked about its intelligence-gathering operations, Shell said: \u201cLike most multinational organisations, Shell takes the duty to protect its people, assets and commercially sensitive information seriously and hires those with the most relevant experience to join its corporate security team, including on occasion former government personnel.\u201d Pace said the scandal highlighted the City of London\u2019s failure to combat money laundering, something that the previous prime minister, David Cameron, had identified as a key priority and which development agencies say is vital if the assets of African countries are not to end up being lost to corruption. \u201cIf we want to stop this kind of deal happening in future, we need to address the system that made it possible,\u201d Pace said. \u201cThat means accountability for those that enable corruption in major financial centres like London.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s commitment to tackling high-end money laundering through the City of London is under serious scrutiny after it emerged that regulators appear to have waved through an $800m bank transfer to a convicted criminal as the proceeds from one of the most corrupt deals in the history of the oil industry.</p> <p>A joint investigation by the <em>Observer</em> and journalists from <a href=\"http:// www.financeuncovered.org\">Finance Uncovered</a>, a non-profit organisation based in London, has discovered that prosecutors in Milan believe two payments of $400m each were wired through JP Morgan in London as the spoils of a huge deal to develop a Nigerian oilfield involving Shell, its joint venture partner the Italian oil giant Eni, and the government in Abuja.</p> <p>More than half the money was converted into bags of bribe cash via bureaux de change in Nigeria, while tens of millions was wired to buy a private jet and armoured cars in the US, according to documents compiled by the prosecutors. But ordinary citizens of Nigeria have not seen a penny from the deal \u2013 which, it is alleged, was partly negotiated by two ex-MI6 officers hired by Shell as \u201cbusiness and investment advisers\u201d.</p> <p>The astonishing allegations have been made by an Italian prosecutor, Fabio de Pasquale, whose previous scalps include former Italian leader Silvio Berlusconi.</p> <p>De Pasquale and his team have spent more than two years following the money trail surrounding the murky sale of Nigeria\u2019s prized Oil Prospecting Licence 245 (OPL 245), a huge block off the coast of west Africa estimated to contain 9.3bn barrels of crude: enough to power the continent for seven years.</p> <p>Oil giants from the west, China and Russia have coveted its riches for years. But Shell and Eni eventually prevailed, paying $1.3bn to the Nigerian government to secure the field in 2011.</p> <p>However, within days the bulk of the money was transferred through JP Morgan in London to a convicted Nigerian money launderer \u2013 a man with whom both Shell and Eni had been negotiating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33fc1d2cdc6164bd35628aff1fe089811437b563\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33fc1d2cdc6164bd35628aff1fe089811437b563/0_129_2417_1450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fabio de Pasquale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italian prosecutor Fabio De Pasquale has previously pursued prime minister Silvio Berlusconi through the courts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe UK authorities have some serious explaining to do,\u201d said Barnaby Pace, a campaigner with the anti-corruption watchdog Global Witness, which has investigated this case for several years.</p> <p>De Pasquale has carried out raids on Eni offices in Italy and Shell\u2019s headquarters in The Hague that have yielded tens of thousands of documents and emails.</p> <p>Last month he requested that an Italian court charge 10 individuals, including five high-ranking executives from Eni, with corruption-related offences. Shell, as a corporate entity, was also included in the request, which will be considered by a court in Milan next month. Shell, Eni and all the executives named by De Pasquale strongly deny the allegations.</p> <p>De Pasquale has also formally warned four former Shell employees, who allegedly played significant roles in securing the deal, that they could be subject to separate proceedings. Among them are Guy Colegate and John Copleston, identified by De Pasquale in legal documents as having \u201cpreviously worked for MI6\u201d.</p> <p>Copleston was a \u201cstrategic investment adviser\u201d at Shell who, as the UK\u2019s former intelligence representative in Nigeria, had nurtured contacts at the highest levels of the country\u2019s military and government.

      "bodyText": "Is there anyone who thinks Snap Inc, the firm behind Snapchat, was justified in issuing shares with zero voting rights? To most minds, Snap\u2019s innovation undermined the whole concept of a shareholding carrying rights of ownership. If a shareholder can\u2019t vote on corporate resolutions, like the appointment of directors and auditors and the payment of dividends, they\u2019ve just bought a ticket to a show. They may still share in the company\u2019s economic success or failure, but shareholding is meant to be a wider idea. Sir Martin Sorrell is the man with the case for defence. \u201cPerhaps surprisingly, corporate structures that seem to offend customary good corporate governance may deliver better long-term results,\u201d declared the chief executive of advertising giant WPP last week. Sorrell gave examples of the companies he had in mind. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox; Comcast, the US cable company with Brian Roberts at the helm; Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s creation, Facebook; and Sergey Brin and Larry Page\u2019s Google. Evan Spiegel at Snap, too, might \u201cprovide the confidence and stability needed to take the appropriate level of risk\u201d, said Sorrell. It\u2019s an impressive list, even if it is too early to tell if Snap \u2013 five years old and loss-making, despite its startling $28bn valuation in last week\u2019s flotation \u2013 is tomorrow\u2019s Facebook or just today\u2019s fad. But it is a list compiled without rigour. One could equally construct a line-up of horror stories involving companies with dominant shareholders and unconventional governance. Robert Maxwell\u2019s Mirror Group and Asil Nadir\u2019s Polly Peck were the great financial scandals of the early 1990s that prompted the City of London to get serious about good governance for the first time. In more recent years, the FTSE 100 index has seen ENRC, straight out of Kazakhstan and \u201cmore Soviet than City\u201d, according to one non-executive director who was ejected from the boardroom as the dominant shareholders asserted control. Or try Bumi, a Nat Rothschild mining creation that descended into shambles and infighting in Indonesia. The truth is that one could point to examples of both triumph and failure at \u201cunconventional\u201d companies. In a general sense, it\u2019s easy to understand that a dominant shareholder could be more willing to take a long-term view of investment. The classic example is Associated British Foods, a FTSE 100 firm but family controlled, which quietly turned its once-small retailing business into the phenomenon that is Primark. Then again, there\u2019s Sports Direct, where long-term investment seems to mean whatever takes Mike Ashley\u2019s fancy. Last week it was Agent Provocateur; next week it could be anything. But the timing of Sorrell\u2019s remarks on the day after Snap\u2019s arrival on the New York Stock Exchange suggest something else: that he thinks disenfranchising shareholders is OK because it encourages risk-taking and creates more wealth for all. The argument could be summed up another way: chief executives should be accountable only to themselves, and the little folk should accept what\u2019s good for them. It\u2019s complete nonsense. It\u2019s a formula for crony capitalism in which insiders can do as they wish, and pay themselves what they want, regardless of outcomes. Such a system has no checks or balances. Shareholders\u2019 power to protest about how the assets are managed is swept under the carpet. Without votes, there is no power. It is the cult of the superman chief executive, whose judgment on the \u201cappropriate level of risk\u201d, as Sorrell puts it, must be trusted absolutely. It is extraordinary that the US \u2013 land of \u201cno taxation without representation\u201d \u2013 has embraced shares with restricted or zero votes. A shareholding democracy offers imperfect protections against boardroom abuse, but turning the dial in the other direction is a recipe for trouble. Maybe Sorrell is jealous. He was paid \u00a370m last year but the sums will fall eventually because his long-term pay scheme had to be reined in after 60% of WPP shareholders voted against it in 2012. Life is much easier when shareholders are reduced to being members of a fan club. PPI deadline will benefit only banks Few things add up in the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal. The first estimate of the scale of the problem was put at \u00a34.5bn. The first provision Lloyds Banking Group took in 2011 of \u00a33.2bn was intended to \u201cdraw a line\u201d under the matter. The reality? The industry\u2019s bill has reached \u00a340bn and Lloyds\u2019s bill is a staggering \u00a317bn. It is little wonder there has been so much imprecision. There appear to have been too few real numbers about the number of policies sold and even fewer clues as to how many were mis-sold. PPI, after all, need not have been a scandal. Sold alongside loans and credit cards with a view to ensuring customers could keep up repayments after sudden loss of income (through illness, say) PPI should have provided a sensible safety net for customers. Except it didn\u2019t. Banks realised it was a moneyspinner. The Financial Conduct Authority has now disclosed that 64m PPI policies were sold to about 30m consumers between 1990 and 2010. Estimates vary as to how much cash it brought through the door. One from 2014 reckons banks received \u00a344bn in premiums from 45m policies. The FCA calculates that 13m claims have been made \u2013 a total which must rise, given the vast number of policies sold. Which is why it is alarming that the FCA has decided that enough is enough. As it announced a deadline of 29 August 2019 for claims, the City regulator said this would prompt the holdouts to take action. The decision to impose a deadline is far more likely to benefit the big banks than their customers. The industry\u2019s intransigence in paying out has spawned a vast claims industry: thousands of people are employed by banks to process claims in part fuelled by claims-management companies, which hassle on customers\u2019 behalf, and add to costs. MoneySavingExpert.com reckons that in half of all cases in the last 12 months where a PPI claim has been rejected by a bank but then taken to the independent ombudsman, the rejection had been overturned. Everything\u2019s relative for Hogg Read these words Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, uttered some characteristically choice words last week when he took evidence from Charlotte Hogg, a newly appointed deputy governor of the Bank of England. \u201cI have over the years got used to doing business with people who are the sons and daughters of people I used to work with. But I think it\u2019s a first where I can say that I used to have lunch with your grandfather in the members\u2019 dining room.\u201d Her grandfather was the late Quintin Hogg, second viscount Hailsham. Her father is Douglas, the third Viscount Hailsham and former Conservative MP and minister. Her mother Sarah \u2013 Baroness Hogg \u2013 is a former journalist and was head of John Major\u2019s policy unit. Tyrie\u2019s words tell us that Charlotte Hogg is part of the establishment. Do those words also show that public life in the UK is all too cosy? Or do they show that Hogg has the confidence to take on the big boys? Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s the latter.",

Or try Bumi, a Nat Rothschild mining creation that descended into shambles and infighting in Indonesia.</p> <p>The truth is that one could point to examples of both triumph and failure at \u201cunconventional\u201d companies.</p> <p>In a general sense, it\u2019s easy to understand that a dominant shareholder could be more willing to take a long-term view of investment. The classic example is Associated British Foods, a FTSE 100 firm but family controlled, which quietly turned its once-small retailing business into the phenomenon that is Primark. Then again, there\u2019s Sports Direct, where long-term investment seems to mean whatever takes Mike Ashley\u2019s fancy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/02/sports-direct-agent-provocateur-lingerie-mike-ashley\">Last week it was Agent Provocateur</a>; next week it could be anything.</p> <p>But the timing of Sorrell\u2019s remarks on the day after Snap\u2019s arrival on the New York Stock Exchange suggest something else: that he thinks disenfranchising shareholders is OK because it encourages risk-taking and creates more wealth for all. The argument could be summed up another way: chief executives should be accountable only to themselves, and the little folk should accept what\u2019s good for them.</p> <p>It\u2019s complete nonsense. It\u2019s a formula for crony capitalism in which insiders can do as they wish, and pay themselves what they want, regardless of outcomes. Such a system has no checks or balances. Shareholders\u2019 power to protest about how the assets are managed is swept under the carpet. Without votes, there is no power. It is the cult of the superman chief executive, whose judgment on the \u201cappropriate level of risk\u201d, as Sorrell puts it, must be trusted absolutely.</p> <p>It is extraordinary that the US \u2013 land of \u201cno taxation without representation\u201d \u2013 has embraced shares with restricted or zero votes. A shareholding democracy offers imperfect protections against boardroom abuse, but turning the dial in the other direction is a recipe for trouble.</p> <p>Maybe Sorrell is jealous. He was paid \u00a370m last year but the sums will fall eventually because his long-term pay scheme had to be reined in after 60% of WPP shareholders voted against it in 2012. Life is much easier when shareholders are reduced to being members of a fan club.</p> <h2>PPI deadline will benefit only banks</h2> <p>Few things add up in the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal. The first estimate of the scale of the problem was put at \u00a34.5bn. The first provision Lloyds Banking Group took in 2011 of \u00a33.2bn was intended to \u201cdraw a line\u201d under the matter. The reality? The industry\u2019s bill has reached \u00a340bn and Lloyds\u2019s bill is a staggering \u00a317bn.</p> <p>It is little wonder there has been so much imprecision. There appear to have been too few real numbers about the number of policies sold and even fewer clues as to how many were mis-sold. PPI, after all, need not have been a scandal. Sold alongside loans and credit cards with a view to ensuring customers could keep up repayments after sudden loss of income (through illness, say) PPI should have provided a sensible safety net for customers.</p> <p>Except it didn\u2019t. Banks realised it was a moneyspinner. The Financial Conduct Authority has now disclosed that 64m PPI policies were sold to about 30m consumers between 1990 and 2010. Estimates vary as to how much cash it brought through the door. One from 2014 reckons banks received \u00a344bn in premiums from 45m policies. The FCA calculates that 13m claims have been made \u2013 a total which must rise, given the vast number of policies sold.</p> <p>Which is why it is alarming that the FCA has decided that enough is enough. As it announced a deadline of 29 August 2019 for claims, the City regulator said this would prompt the holdouts to take action.</p> <p>The decision to impose a deadline is far more likely to benefit the big banks than their customers. The industry\u2019s intransigence in paying out has spawned a vast claims industry: thousands of people are employed by banks to process claims in part fuelled by claims-management companies, which hassle on customers\u2019 behalf, and add to costs. MoneySavingExpert.com reckons that in half of all cases in the last 12 months where a PPI claim has been rejected by a bank but then taken to the independent ombudsman, the rejection had been overturned.</p> <h2>Everything\u2019s relative for Hogg</h2> <p>Read these words Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, uttered some characteristically choice words last week when he took evidence from Charlotte Hogg, a newly appointed deputy governor of the Bank of England. \u201cI have over the years got used to doing business with people who are the sons and daughters of people I used to work with. But I think it\u2019s a first where I can say that I used to have lunch with your grandfather in the members\u2019 dining room.\u201d<br></p> <p>Her grandfather was the late Quintin Hogg, second viscount Hailsham. Her father is Douglas, the third Viscount Hailsham and former Conservative MP and minister. Her mother Sarah \u2013 Baroness Hogg \u2013 is a former journalist and was head of John Major\u2019s policy unit.</p> <p>Tyrie\u2019s words tell us that Charlotte Hogg is part of the establishment. Do those words also show that public life in the UK is all too cosy? Or do they show that Hogg has the confidence to take on the big boys? Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s the latter.</p>",

Few tire of tales of the firm\u2019s pre-results gaffes, which most memorably included a prisoner tricking his G4S guards into tagging his prosthetic leg, thereby allowing him to skip his curfew by detaching the limb. So, few would blame the accident-prone security group for seeking cover for this week\u2019s results \u2013 pencilled in for Wednesday, which also happens to be the day of the budget. Also giving the impression of wanting to hide that day is Foxtons \u2013 the irritating estate agency that doesn\u2019t usually have the good manners to adopt anything other than a pushy approach. Its shares are down more than 40% since June, which you might think explains the timing of its results. However, burying bad news on budget day is such a tired tactic that it rarely works out well for the geniuses rehashing the plan. It is the first thing City-watchers tend to look for when studying the corporate calendar during budget week, particularly after 2013. Back then, bonus awards at Barclays - including \u00a317.6m worth of shares to Cheltenham-bound, tweed-clad Rich Ricci \u2013 were snuck out. The result? Blanket derision. The bank later admitted the move was \u201ca mistake\u201d. Green nears pension landmark A better week for Sir Philip Green, who after seeming to finally \u201csort\u201d the BHS pension problem hopes he might retain his precious knighthood. Yes, now the tycoon has agreed to hand over \u00a3363m in cash to rescue the defunct retailer\u2019s retirement plan, he\u2019s free to at least attempt a return to his former life, in which he could enjoy his wealth surrounded by admirers rather than impertinent critics. Which brings us to irascible tycoon\u2019s imminent birthday, which Green is partial to marking in years ending with a two or a seven with small party (you know the sort of thing: 150 of your closest showbiz friends, music by Robbie Williams, bromancing with Leonardo DiCaprio). Anyway, his 2017 birthday is a significant one, and in 10 days Green turns 65, so old enough to draw his state, er, pension. No one seems able to say whether his old pals still want to share these occasions with him, although wife Tina will surely spend the week in her pinny trying to pull off a Mary Berry, before running a duster over the couple\u2019s yacht, Lionheart. For what it\u2019s worth, the gaudy tub remains stubbornly moored in Livorno, Italy. That\u2019s the boat, not Green. Queue forms to help Uber Now the end of the Sir Philip Green and BHS scandal seems to be approaching, parliament\u2019s business, energy and industrial strategy select committee is looking for fresh targets. It is calling a series of witnesses on Tuesday for a session looking at protections for gig-economy and agency workers, which will also address tax reporting and the role of trade unions. No doubt this will upset someone at charming firms such as Deliveroo and Uber, which are either glorified courier/minicab services or disruptive technologies, depending on your susceptibility to corporate jargon. Still, maybe these companies are ready to embrace insights into the world of the folk who work for them. Nowadays, of course, Uber is seeking advice on its behaviour.
