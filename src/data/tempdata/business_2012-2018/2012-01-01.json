    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "With the eurozone on the brink of a new recession, this will be the year when millions of people bear the brunt", 
      "body": "<p>The fluctuations of the financial markets and the relentless round of make-or-break euro-summits gripped the attention in 2011, but this will be the year when the shockwaves are felt by millions of people in Europe and beyond.</p> <p>Throughout 2011, the language of bond yields, AAA ratings and credit default swaps leapt from City trading floors into everyday chit-chat as the eurozone crisis spiralled out of control.</p> <p>Instead of answering first to their electorates, Europe's politicians became fixated on sating the demands of anxious investors in the bond markets for ever more drastic spending cuts. Preventing Italian bond yields from topping 7%, and protecting France's AAA credit rating became central policy aims.</p> <p>But reducing the eurozone's malaise to numbers flashing on a screen only served to mask the fact that millions of livelihoods were at stake in what the technocrats call the \"real economy\", but most of us would call real life.</p> <p>The policy of collective austerity imposed at the behest of the money men has driven the eurozone to the brink of a new recession. In 2012 it will be swept over the edge, carrying with it the jobs of millions.</p> <p>It's hardly surprising people became increasingly angry as they watched policymakers fail so comprehensively to protect them from the lash of the speculators. From the street sit-ins of Greece's Indignati, to the thousands of young people who gathered in Puerta del Sol square in Madrid to demand a stake in their country's future, the public expressed their exasperation.</p> <p>In 2012, their anger is likely to become more widespread and intense. A recent report by the International Labour Organisation in Geneva warned of rising discontent in many countries about \"perceptions that the burden of the crisis is not being shared fairly\". It said that even without a new global recession, it could take five years for employment rates to return to pre-crisis levels.</p> <p>Young people have borne the brunt everywhere. In Spain, where the new government announced a radical package of austerity measures on Friday, the youth unemployment rate is now an almost inconceivable 45%; in Greece, it is 42.9%; in Ireland, 29.8%. That will take a heavy toll in shattered dreams and frustrated expectations. As Heiner Flassbeck, of the UN Conference on Trade and Development puts it: \"Those that were not part of the party are having hangovers: that's the problem.\"</p> <p>And it's only going to get worse. When Europe's leaders \u2013 barring David Cameron \u2013 pledged to boost the eurozone bailout fund and draw up a new \"fiscal compact\" to enforce budget discipline last month, they hoped (yet again) to draw a line under the eurozone debt crisis and escape the unforgiving glare of the world's financial markets.</p> <p>But even if the new framework is drawn up and agreed rapidly, Europe's economies, including Britain's, face a desperate 12 months.</p> <p>Across-the-board austerity \u2013 the only prescription considered by \"Merkozy\" and their colleagues \u2013 will weigh heavily on growth in the eurozone and beyond, even if the immediate crisis is resolved.</p> <p>Flassbeck fears that the global economy is facing a \"lost decade\", akin to the prolonged period of stagnation and deflation that has afflicted Japan since the early 1990s, as austerity is piled on austerity, and demand is depressed.</p> <p>Alongside the long-term danger of stagnation, there remains an acute risk that Europe's financial system&#xa0;will seize up. There is growing evidence that eurozone banks, with their exposures to the debts of peripheral eurozone economies, are finding it difficult to borrow at anything but punitive interest rates.</p> <p>Despite drastic emergency measures from the European Central Bank (ECB), including pumping almost \u20ac500bn (\u00a3420bn) of low-cost loans into financial markets on 21 December, the banks are struggling to finance themselves.</p> <p>That means, as the ECB president, Mario Draghi, has acknowledged, that a credit crunch akin to that in the wake of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 may already be under way. If that starts to undermine ordinary savers' confidence in their banks, it could be catastrophic.</p> <p>Italian and Greek consumers have been draining their banks of deposits for months in what amounts to a slow-motion bank run. If it became a full-blown collapse, the situation could quickly spiral beyond the control of the authorities, which is why George Osborne has told parliament that the Treasury and the Bank of England have drawn up detailed contingency plans to cope with a eurozone meltdown.

      "bodyText": "The fluctuations of the financial markets and the relentless round of make-or-break euro-summits gripped the attention in 2011, but this will be the year when the shockwaves are felt by millions of people in Europe and beyond. Throughout 2011, the language of bond yields, AAA ratings and credit default swaps leapt from City trading floors into everyday chit-chat as the eurozone crisis spiralled out of control. Instead of answering first to their electorates, Europe's politicians became fixated on sating the demands of anxious investors in the bond markets for ever more drastic spending cuts. Preventing Italian bond yields from topping 7%, and protecting France's AAA credit rating became central policy aims. But reducing the eurozone's malaise to numbers flashing on a screen only served to mask the fact that millions of livelihoods were at stake in what the technocrats call the \"real economy\", but most of us would call real life. The policy of collective austerity imposed at the behest of the money men has driven the eurozone to the brink of a new recession. In 2012 it will be swept over the edge, carrying with it the jobs of millions. It's hardly surprising people became increasingly angry as they watched policymakers fail so comprehensively to protect them from the lash of the speculators. From the street sit-ins of Greece's Indignati, to the thousands of young people who gathered in Puerta del Sol square in Madrid to demand a stake in their country's future, the public expressed their exasperation. In 2012, their anger is likely to become more widespread and intense. A recent report by the International Labour Organisation in Geneva warned of rising discontent in many countries about \"perceptions that the burden of the crisis is not being shared fairly\". It said that even without a new global recession, it could take five years for employment rates to return to pre-crisis levels. Young people have borne the brunt everywhere. In Spain, where the new government announced a radical package of austerity measures on Friday, the youth unemployment rate is now an almost inconceivable 45%; in Greece, it is 42.9%; in Ireland, 29.8%. That will take a heavy toll in shattered dreams and frustrated expectations. As Heiner Flassbeck, of the UN Conference on Trade and Development puts it: \"Those that were not part of the party are having hangovers: that's the problem.\" And it's only going to get worse. When Europe's leaders \u2013 barring David Cameron \u2013 pledged to boost the eurozone bailout fund and draw up a new \"fiscal compact\" to enforce budget discipline last month, they hoped (yet again) to draw a line under the eurozone debt crisis and escape the unforgiving glare of the world's financial markets. But even if the new framework is drawn up and agreed rapidly, Europe's economies, including Britain's, face a desperate 12 months. Across-the-board austerity \u2013 the only prescription considered by \"Merkozy\" and their colleagues \u2013 will weigh heavily on growth in the eurozone and beyond, even if the immediate crisis is resolved. Flassbeck fears that the global economy is facing a \"lost decade\", akin to the prolonged period of stagnation and deflation that has afflicted Japan since the early 1990s, as austerity is piled on austerity, and demand is depressed. Alongside the long-term danger of stagnation, there remains an acute risk that Europe's financial system will seize up. There is growing evidence that eurozone banks, with their exposures to the debts of peripheral eurozone economies, are finding it difficult to borrow at anything but punitive interest rates. Despite drastic emergency measures from the European Central Bank (ECB), including pumping almost \u20ac500bn (\u00a3420bn) of low-cost loans into financial markets on 21 December, the banks are struggling to finance themselves. That means, as the ECB president, Mario Draghi, has acknowledged, that a credit crunch akin to that in the wake of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 may already be under way. If that starts to undermine ordinary savers' confidence in their banks, it could be catastrophic. Italian and Greek consumers have been draining their banks of deposits for months in what amounts to a slow-motion bank run. If it became a full-blown collapse, the situation could quickly spiral beyond the control of the authorities, which is why George Osborne has told parliament that the Treasury and the Bank of England have drawn up detailed contingency plans to cope with a eurozone meltdown. It could yet happen \u2013 and soon. Even if the financial system is stabilised and the eurozone holds together, though, the fragile banks are likely to cut back lending to Europe's households and businesses. And that's where the abstract idea of a credit crunch becomes reality: people lose their homes as mortgage lending is reined in; businesses lay off staff because they can no longer fund their operations. All this, ultimately, because of politicians' contorted efforts to placate the financial markets. Yet even at the IMF, usually considered the bastion of the so-called \"Washington consensus\" of privatisation, free-flowing capital and balanced budgets, chief economist Olivier Blanchard recently blogged that financial investors had contradictory feelings about austerity, because it can often hit growth, and make it harder, not easier for governments to repay their debts. \"They react positively to news of fiscal consolidation, but then react negatively later, when consolidation leads to lower growth \u2013 which it often does,\" he said. So even for the financial markets, at whose behest Europe's leaders are holding the axe over their hapless citizens, 2012 looks like being a very unhappy new year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "German manufacturing group Siemens has urged the government to keep the financial details of its bid for the \u00a31.4bn Thameslink contract under wraps after MPs called for further scrutiny of the auction. The transport select committee has recommended that the government reveal the financial difference between the Siemens offer, which has secured frontrunner status, and that of second-placed bidder Bombardier. The Thameslink deal has become a totemic issue for trade unions, local MPs and critics of government procurement policy after Bombardier warned that it will have to lose more than 1,400 jobs at its Derby plant in the wake of the decision. Steve Scrimshaw, the head of UK rail at Siemens, told the Guardian that revealing the financial calculations behind bids would undermine the company's ability to win contests in the future. Siemens and Bombardier are also going head-to-head for the \u00a31bn Crossrail contract, viewed as vital for Derby facility's future. \"I don't think that it is beneficial to any party that has been involved in a competitive process. Such information is commercially sensitive and highly confidential,\" said Scrimshaw. In a report last month, the transport select committee also urged the public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, to scrutinize the deal. Scrimshaw added that Siemens had taken part in a \"fair and transparent\" bidding process for the Thameslink contract, which the company expects to finalise this year despite reports that it is struggling to put the financing together. \"We are confident that we will close the contracts in early 2012,\" he said. According to a recent report, concluding the contract for 1,200 carriages on the Thameslink rail route has been held up by a lack of agreement between the Siemens-led consortium and banks. However, Siemens is confident it will secure the credit it needs. It has been suggested in committee hearings that Siemens' ability to secure cheaper debt, as opposed to the quality of its trains, was the key factor in beating Canadian manufacturer Bombardier to preferred bidder status. In its report last month the transport select committee said: \"If the government proceeds to sign a contract with Siemens we recommend that it publish the reasons for favouring Siemens over Bombardier and the difference in the cost of the two bids.\" Responding to Scrimshaw's comments, the committee's chair, Louise Ellman, said Siemens' concerns were secondary to the public interest. \"There has been so much concern about the award of the contract it would be in the public interest to release the details,\" said Ellman, adding that voters deserved to know whether Siemens won preferred bidder status for its superior financial heft. The Thameslink deal will be financed by the Siemens-led consortium, which will put equity into a specially created business and then raise the debt to build the trains at the Siemens factory near D\u00fcsseldorf. In a private finance initiative-style structure, those trains will then be leased back to the train operator on Thameslink, which will pay a regular fee to the consortium that will in turn repay the debt. Under such a funding scenario, securing debt on good terms is crucial. This has prompted calls from Bombardier that financing should be separated from train design and manufacturing when the government decides the winner of future carriage contracts. A DfT spokesman said: \"We are bound by an agreement with the bidders not to release commercially confidential information.\" Last week the government raised hopes for Bombardier's survival in the UK by backing the award of a \u00a3188m contract to the Derby plant with an \u00a380m state subsidy. However, observers say the deal to make 130 Electrostar carriages for the Southern rail franchise is not enough to guarantee the Derby plant's long-term future. Another contract is in the offing after the transport secretary, Justine Greening, said last month that she was \"enthusiastic\" about awarding the Canadian group \u00a3120m contract to build carriages for the CrossCountry franchise. The contract remains in the sidings as Greening did not give the complete go-ahead to the deal. A \u00a31bn contract for carriages on the Crossrail line, a \u00a315bn project linking Heathrow to Canary Wharf, is vital to Bombardier's long-term survival in the UK. Bombardier and Siemens are shortlisted for the Crossrail contract, along with Spain's CAF and Hitachi of Japan. Announcing the winner of the contract has been delayed from 2013 to 2014, allowing the bidding guidelines to include recommendations from a government review of public procurement announced in the wake of the Thameslink decision. Government-backed Crossrail said it was keen for the contest to have a \"sharper focus on the UK's strategic interest\", in a clear hint that it is trying to heed calls for a \"level playing field\" for UK businesses in the carriage competition.",

      "bodyText": "The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has warned that the year ahead will \"undoubtedly\" be harder than 2011 in the starkest of a series of downbeat messages from European leaders dominated by fears over the economy. Merkel said Europe was experiencing its \"harshest test in decades\" but would ultimately be made stronger by the crisis. Urging greater European co-operation to salvage the Euro, Merkel said the German economy was performing well \"even if the next year will undoubtedly be more difficult than this one\". Her solemn new year greeting, broadcast on Saturday, set the tone for those of her European counterparts. The Greek prime minister, Lucas Papademos, spelled out a continuation of harsh austerity measures, while the Italian president, Giorgio Napolitano, warned that sacrifices would have to be made if the country was to avoid \"financial collapse\". The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, said people had to be \"courageous\" when facing the challenges ahead. \"I know that the lives of many of you, already tested by two difficult years, have been put to the test once more. You are ending the year more worried about yourselves and your children,\" he said, adding: \"This unprecedented crisis, which is without doubt the worst since the second world war, is not over\". But Sarkozy, who is lagging behind in the polls just months from a presidential election, vowed that there were nonetheless \"reasons to be hopeful\" and that no further public spending cuts would be made. Napolitano was less eager to gloss over the economic position of a country which last year was feared to be on the brink of becoming the next eurozone country to seek a bailout. \"Sacrifices are necessary to ensure the future of young people; it's our objective and a commitment we cannot avoid,\" he said in his new year speech. \"No one, no social group, can today avoid the commitment to contribute to the clean up of public finances in order to prevent the financial collapse of Italy,\" Napolitano added. As growth stalls in countries across Europe, governments are coming under pressure to make further cuts to spending and fears are growing that 2012 could bring a second recession. In Greece \u2013 the first country to have sought a bailout in 2010 \u2013 Papademos warned there would be no let-up in the austerity measures, which many Greeks feel are too tough. \"We have to continue our efforts with determination, so that the sacrifices we have made up to now won't be in vain,\" he said in a televised address. Papademos, an economist who was appointed to lead an interim coalition government in November after the resignation of George Papandreou, insists the measures are essential if Greece is to continue to receive bailout funds.",

Backed by George Osborne's call for a \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/23/budget-2011-tax-breaks-businesses\" title=\"Osborne budget 2011\">march of the makers</a>\", Britain's producers have become a symbol of the new economy that a post-crunch nation is striving for.</p> <p>The drive to rebalance the economy \u2013 three-quarters of Britain's GDP is dependent on services such as advertising and retail \u2013 has widespread support. Hence the dismay when Britain's remaining train factory, the Bombardier plant in Derby, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/22/bombardier-rail-contract-derby-williamson\" title=\"Guardian: Bombardier's hopes dashed as Cameron refuses to halt 1.4bn train contract\">was beaten by a German rival </a>for a \u00a31.4bn government order last year.</p> <p>There is also cold logic behind the drive for a renewed manufacturing boom, untempered by nostalgia for the early 1990s when manufacturing accounted for more than 20% of GDP compared with 10% now. The governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/20/mervyn-king-internationaltrade\" title=\"Beware global economic imbalances, Mervyn King warns\"> has warned of \"imbalances\"</a> in the global economy, driven by low domestic demand from big exporters such as Germany and China, who funnel their excess goods into indebted countries such as Britain and Spain. A simplification of course, but the point is that Britain needs to export more and import less, because countries that spend too much tend to manufacture too little. It is one of the less painful ways of reducing the deficit.</p> <p>But political and public backing alone will not guarantee a strong performance. As with the rest of the economy, manufacturing is critically dependent on the eurozone pulling back from the abyss. About half of British exports are manufactured goods, from cars to aircraft engines, with nearly half of those to the European Union.</p> <p>Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, says the momentum generated by a strong 2010 and a good start to 2011 was checked by an uncertain outlook. Companies who make automotive, mechanical and aerospace products are performing well, says Hopley, but the metals, defence and construction sectors are struggling. \"It is not like early in 2011 when all sectors and all markets were doing well in Europe. That's certainly not the case now,\"</p> <p>She adds: \"If you take the big uncertainty out of the equation, which is Europe, we see companies having enough confidence to increase investments and go after new markets. If Europe does not sort out its problems we are looking at a much more uncertain and gloomier outlook.\"</p> <h2>Rosy outlook</h2> <p>Darchem Engineering, a maker of specialist insulation that straddles the private and government sectors, is \"optimistic but cautious\" this year, according to its UK managing director Graham Payne says the civil aerospace part of the business, which supplies insulation for fuel and air ducts in aircraft, is enjoying \"strong\" demand. There is a link here with the rosy outlook for Rolls-Royce, one of the world's largest aircraft engine makers, and aerospace firm Airbus, which opened a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/13/airbus-urges-uk-dont-stop-investing-in-research\" title=\"Airbus factory opened\"> new factory for building A350 wings </a>in Wales last year.</p> <p>Payne says \"headwinds\" have been felt in defence and nuclear, sectors with strong links to public spending. \"I am seeing early signs of the European government financial situation starting to impact on markets, especially nuclear and defence.\" For instance, BAE Systems, Britain's largest industrial employer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/25/bae-systems-job-losses\" title=\"BAE job cuts\">announced plans to cut nearly 3,000 aircraft manufacturing jobs</a> in September following the government's defence spending review. Nonetheless, Darchem expects turnover to rise by about 10% this year to between \u00a370m and \u00a375m.</p> <p>One manufacturing sector guaranteed to have a strong year is automotives, Britain's biggest export market. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says 1.5m cars will be built in Britain this year, up from 1.4m in 2011. This is good news for exports because eight out of ten of those vehicles will be sold abroad. Paul Everitt, SMMT chief executive, says he expects production to increase, even against the backdrop of a faltering eurozone. \"China, the Middle East and even the US are looking OK. We are quietly confident that next year will see further growth.\"</p> <p>Such Optimism is underpinned by investment announcements by major UK-based car producers last year. BMW said the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/09/bmw-build-new-mini-uk-cowley-oxford\" title=\"Mini to be built in Britain\"> new Mini would be built in Oxford</a>; Jaguar Land Rover announced plans for 1,750 new jobs; and Toyota said it would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/24/toyota-1500-new-jobs-derby\" title=\"Guardian: Toyota jobs\">create 1,500 jobs</a> by increasing production at its Derby plant. Everitt said: the automotive sector now has a \"good picture\" for the next three to five years. \"We have had \u00a34bn of investment committed to the UK in a year. I don't think there was one major manufacturer that did not make a major statement about its intentions.\" If only the eurozone could provide such certainty.</p>",

Hence the dismay when Britain's remaining train factory, the Bombardier plant in Derby, was beaten by a German rival for a \u00a31.4bn government order last year. There is also cold logic behind the drive for a renewed manufacturing boom, untempered by nostalgia for the early 1990s when manufacturing accounted for more than 20% of GDP compared with 10% now. The governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, has warned of \"imbalances\" in the global economy, driven by low domestic demand from big exporters such as Germany and China, who funnel their excess goods into indebted countries such as Britain and Spain. A simplification of course, but the point is that Britain needs to export more and import less, because countries that spend too much tend to manufacture too little. It is one of the less painful ways of reducing the deficit. But political and public backing alone will not guarantee a strong performance. As with the rest of the economy, manufacturing is critically dependent on the eurozone pulling back from the abyss. About half of British exports are manufactured goods, from cars to aircraft engines, with nearly half of those to the European Union. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, says the momentum generated by a strong 2010 and a good start to 2011 was checked by an uncertain outlook. Companies who make automotive, mechanical and aerospace products are performing well, says Hopley, but the metals, defence and construction sectors are struggling. \"It is not like early in 2011 when all sectors and all markets were doing well in Europe. That's certainly not the case now,\" She adds: \"If you take the big uncertainty out of the equation, which is Europe, we see companies having enough confidence to increase investments and go after new markets. If Europe does not sort out its problems we are looking at a much more uncertain and gloomier outlook.\" Rosy outlook Darchem Engineering, a maker of specialist insulation that straddles the private and government sectors, is \"optimistic but cautious\" this year, according to its UK managing director Graham Payne says the civil aerospace part of the business, which supplies insulation for fuel and air ducts in aircraft, is enjoying \"strong\" demand. There is a link here with the rosy outlook for Rolls-Royce, one of the world's largest aircraft engine makers, and aerospace firm Airbus, which opened a new factory for building A350 wings in Wales last year. Payne says \"headwinds\" have been felt in defence and nuclear, sectors with strong links to public spending. \"I am seeing early signs of the European government financial situation starting to impact on markets, especially nuclear and defence.\" For instance, BAE Systems, Britain's largest industrial employer, announced plans to cut nearly 3,000 aircraft manufacturing jobs in September following the government's defence spending review. Nonetheless, Darchem expects turnover to rise by about 10% this year to between \u00a370m and \u00a375m. One manufacturing sector guaranteed to have a strong year is automotives, Britain's biggest export market. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says 1.5m cars will be built in Britain this year, up from 1.4m in 2011. This is good news for exports because eight out of ten of those vehicles will be sold abroad. Paul Everitt, SMMT chief executive, says he expects production to increase, even against the backdrop of a faltering eurozone. \"China, the Middle East and even the US are looking OK. We are quietly confident that next year will see further growth.\" Such Optimism is underpinned by investment announcements by major UK-based car producers last year. BMW said the new Mini would be built in Oxford; Jaguar Land Rover announced plans for 1,750 new jobs; and Toyota said it would create 1,500 jobs by increasing production at its Derby plant. Everitt said: the automotive sector now has a \"good picture\" for the next three to five years. \"We have had \u00a34bn of investment committed to the UK in a year. I don't think there was one major manufacturer that did not make a major statement about its intentions.\" If only the eurozone could provide such certainty.",
