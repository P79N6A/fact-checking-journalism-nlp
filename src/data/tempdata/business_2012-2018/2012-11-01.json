Bank executives complain loudly about ambulance-chasing lawyers and complaints-handling outfits that have exploited the situation to encourage thousands of spurious claims and cream off millions of pounds for themselves. Yet an ounce of honesty inside the banking system could have prevented costs escalating out of control. Instead they lobbied hard with the regulator and government against any crackdown on what was obviously a dodgy product. Victory secured, they carried on selling the insurance for several years longer than was prudent. They also, once the scandal was beyond dispute, insisted that the regulator force individuals to make a claim for compensation, much as they had when the endowment misselling scandal hit in the late 1990s. Believing it to be a clever ruse, the banks convinced themselves this strategy would avoid the huge costs of the personal pensions misselling scandal of the early 90s that saw them going through every file to determine how much each individual was out of pocket. There was much to gain from putting off the reckoning. Individuals such as Barclays boss Matt Barrett and Lloyds chief Peter Ellwood, who both earned huge bonuses on the back of PPI profits, should be answerable for knowingly duping the public into purchasing policies they would never be able to claim on. In the US they charge the sellers of such products with racketeering. Executives from all the major banks, as this paper revealed in 2004, met several times a year in Dublin, where they based their insurance arms to benefit from low taxes. The meetings were part of a conspiracy to protect what had become a golden goose for the industry. Public relations strategies were discussed and questions from the regulator answered by this secret cabal. The regulator refused to investigate until forced to by a super-complaint by Citizens Advice. Even now the regulator has ignored the conspiracy element of the story. A whistleblower talked to the Guardian. No one from the Financial Services Authority has shown any interest in talking to him. It has never asked who attended the meetings in Dublin or requested minutes of what happened. If the banks want to deny the meetings took place, fine \u2013 then the offshore operation was a sham, and they owe the exchequer millions in unpaid corporation tax.",

Victory secured, they carried on selling the insurance for several years longer than was prudent.</p> <p>They also, once the scandal was beyond dispute, insisted that the regulator force individuals to make a claim for compensation, much as they had when the endowment misselling scandal hit in the late 1990s.</p> <p>Believing it to be a clever ruse, the banks convinced themselves this strategy would avoid the huge costs of the personal pensions misselling scandal of the early 90s that saw them going through every file to determine how much each individual was out of pocket.</p> <p>There was much to gain from putting off the reckoning. Individuals such as Barclays boss Matt Barrett and Lloyds chief Peter Ellwood, who both earned huge bonuses on the back of PPI profits, should be answerable for knowingly duping the public into purchasing policies they would never be able to claim on. In the US they charge the sellers of such products with racketeering.</p> <p>Executives from all the major banks, as this paper revealed in 2004, met several times a year in Dublin, where they based their insurance arms to benefit from low taxes. The meetings were part of a conspiracy to protect what had become a golden goose for the industry. Public relations strategies were discussed and questions from the regulator answered by this secret cabal.</p> <p>The regulator refused to investigate until forced to by a super-complaint by Citizens Advice. Even now the regulator has ignored the conspiracy element of the story. A whistleblower talked to the Guardian. No one from the Financial Services Authority has shown any interest in talking to him. It has never asked who attended the meetings in Dublin or requested minutes of what happened. If the banks want to deny the meetings took place, fine \u2013 then the offshore operation was a sham, and they owe the exchequer millions in unpaid corporation tax.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group's bill to compensate customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance has risen to \u00a35.3bn after the bailed out-bank announced it would take another \u00a31bn charge to cover the costs of redress and warned there could be more to come. The major high street banks combined have now incurred costs relating to the PPI scandal of more than \u00a310bn \u2013 a total that is expected to increase again on Friday when Royal Bank of Scotland is forecast to add \u00a3400m to its existing \u00a31.3bn charge. Consumer body Which? calculates that the total PPI compensation bill, including smaller banks and building societies, is more than \u00a312bn, surpassing the pension mis-selling scandal of the 1980s to become the costliest in history. In the past three months, Lloyds has paid out \u00a38m a day. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, chief executive of Lloyds, warned that the bank was still unable to quantify the total cost of the PPI affair as the bank was continuing to assess the level of claims being made \u2013 some of which, the bank insists, are being submitted by claims management firms on behalf of customers who do not have policies with the bank. \"A number of uncertainties remain as to the eventual cost to the group of PPI complaints,\" Lloyds said. By the time it reports its full-year results for 2012, on 1 March, the bank said it expected to have a \"higher degree of confidence in forecast trends and the ultimate likely cost of PPI\". The provisions for compensation over PPI \u2013 which was sold to cover loan repayments if customers ran into financial difficulties \u2013 helped drive the bank, just under 40% owned by the taxpayer, to a pre-tax loss of \u00a3583m for the first nine months of the year. Lloyds said that while the volume of PPI complaints had slowed in the third quarter, it is still higher than the estimates it made in the second half of the year. Even so, the extra \u00a31bn provision was less than the \u00a32.3bn that some analysts had feared. The bank's shares leapt 8% to 43.9p \u2013 but even after the rise, the shares remain well below the 73p average price at which the taxpayer bailed out the bank, representing a paper loss of around \u00a35bn. Horta-Os\u00f3rio insisted he had \"absolutely no regrets\" about his ground-breaking decision in March 2011 to withdraw from an industry-wide attempt to fight PPI claims through the courts. That move led to the collapse of the united front and subsequently to charges being taken across the industry. Barclays' provision has reached \u00a32bn, HSBC's results on Monday will be scrutinised for an increase to its \u00a31.1bn provision, while Santander has put aside around \u00a3500m. Lloyds was the first take a provision, of \u00a33.2bn, in May 2011, which led to bonuses being clawed back from Horta-Os\u00f3rio's predecessor Eric Daniels and other former and current Lloyds bankers. Without taking the provision, Lloyds \"would have been building on false foundations\", said Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who became chief executive at the start of March 2011. \"Banks had lost sight of their core values, had become complacent, non-customer-focused and inefficient,\" he said. \"We could not transform this business without addressing the PPI legacy.\" The Portuguese-born banker insisted Lloyds was ahead of its strategic plan \u2013 which will eventually to lead to almost 45,000 job cuts across the bank, which includes brands such as Halifax and Scottish Widows. The bank is nonetheless trying to fight back against management companies making PPI claims on behalf of customers. Lloyds wrote to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) last month to suggest claims management companies pay the \u00a3850 costs associated with processing each case they bring. Lloyds insists that 50% of the claims it receives are \"duplicates or dubious\" but Natalie Ceeney, head of the FOS, told MPs this week that too many claims were being thrown out by the banks. Lloyds insisted on Thursday that this was not the case and asked Ceeney for data. Even so, the FOS believes that 98% of claims against Lloyds end up being paid out. As well as the PPI scandal, Lloyds is also paying claims in German courts for policies sold by Clerical Medical through intermediaries in Germany. Another \u00a3150m provision was taken in the third quarter, taking the total to \u00a3325m. Lloyds's \u00a3583m loss for the nine-month period was narrower than the \u00a33.8bn it reported for the same period a year ago. Mis-selling scandals Personal pensions In the early 1990s final salary pension scheme savers were led to ditch gold-plated plans and buy risky stock-market products with promises of cash bonuses to switch. Some banks were offering transfer rates to businesses to win million pound contracts from pension schemes. Up to 3m workers were affected. Cost to banks: \u00a311.8bn. Mortgage endowments During the late 1990s about 5 million homeowners were told that by having an interest-only mortgage and investing the \"repayment\" part into a life insurance policy they would repay the capital and make a profit. Investors were told later the investment wouldn't repay the loans. Cost to banks: \u00a32.7bn. Payment protection insurance Sold on unsecured loans, PPI was to protect customers if they couldn't pay. Banks staff were given bonuses for selling PPI and 18m policies were sold. But small print excluded most policyholders from claims. Cost to banks: \u00a312.3bn. Interest-rate swaps The newest scandal: banks selling loans to businesses linked to certain interest rates. The Financial Services Authority said products were complicated and mis-sold. Cost to banks: Unknown. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2012 to make clear that Lloyds wrote to the Financial Ombudsman Service last month to suggest claims management companies pay the \u00a3850 costs associated with processing each case they bring, rather than the \u00a3850m total costs",

One said: \"If you haven't got brown goods or a big range, you are always going to struggle, and some brands just didn't buy into the new arrangement.\" Analysts did not expect a buyer for the entire business, meaning stores could be sold off to other retailers. OpCapita is thought to be the largest secured creditor, so will be repaid first from monies raised by the administration process.

Barclays, which was fined a record \u00a3290m for attempting to manipulate the Libor benchmark interest rate, said it \"strongly\" disagreed with allegations. \"We believe that our trading was legitimate and in compliance with applicable law. The [Ferc order] is by its very nature a one-sided document, and does not reflect a balanced and full description of the facts or the applicable legal standard,\" Barclays said. Stressing it had co-operated with the investigation, which began in 2007, the bank's spokesman said: \"We intend to vigorously defend this matter\". Unlike Libor where the penalty was agreed by Barclays in a settlement with three regulators, including the Financial Services Authority in the UK, Barclays may need to take proceedings to court if it is to fend off the penalty proposed by Ferc. The energy regulator included remarks by Joseph Gold, head of commodities for Barclays in the US, who in his evidence to Ferc insisted he had made clear that traders deliberating making losses was unacceptable. \"The golden rule was always, under no circumstances, lose money on a transaction for the intention of making money on another transaction,\" Gold said. The $490m penalty is based on a $435m fine and the disgorgement of the $35m profit the bank is alleged to have made. The investigation began after Ferc received calls from market participants to its hotline. The Californian electricity market was the subject of scrutiny after the collapse of Enron when regulators produced documents showing that strategies named Fat Boy and Get Shorty were used to try to increase profits from trading power in the western US state,",

      "bodyText": "And with that I'm afraid we're closing the blog early today. Thanks for all your comments. The Greek parliament will back new austerity measures, set to be put to a vote next Wednesday, finance minister said today. Following a meeting with prime minister Antonis Samaras, he said: I am not particularly concerned. I believe the measures will pass. Over to Cyprus, which is getting ever closer to a bailout. The island's central bank governor said today that \"substantial progress\" had been made in talks with lenders. Panicos Demetriades, who is also on the governing council of the ECB, said: I can say there has been substantial progress \u2013 in the last few days particularly \u2013 in our negotiations with the troika. I anticipate the troika will be in a position to come to Cyprus soon with the purpose of finalising the financial assistance programme. That seems to be backed up by the IMF, which said it expects a follow-up mission to Cyprus \"soon\" but no dates have been specified yet. Asked about Greece, the IMF spokesman told Reuters that discussions are ongoing about financing issues. Overall, the US data looks good for Obama. The Democrats will jump on anything pointing to an improving economic environment as a vindication of its policies. Taking a closer look at the US data. The pace of growth in the manufacturing sector picked up slightly last month, as new orders improved, but a measure of employment slowed. New orders rose to 54.2 from 52.3, which bodes well for the future. But employment slipped from 54.7 to 52.1. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, rose in October to its highest in more than four years. The markets have been rallying since before the releases, leading some people to question whether the information slipped out early. US Dow Jones: up 1% UK FTSE: up 1% France CAC 40: up 0.9% Germany DAX: up 0.8% Greece has, however, been left out of the party. The Athens stock exchange dropped 5.37%, with banks down 12.5%. US consumer confidence picked up in October, and the manufacturing sector grew faster than expected, bolstering President Obama ahead of the elections on Tuesday. US consumer confidence rose to 72.2, from (a downwardly revised reading of) 68.4 in September. That's slightly lower than expectations of 73. The ISM manufacturing survey came in at 51.7, above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. That's better than expectations of a reading of 51.2. The Czech central bank shocked the markets with an interest rate cut today \u2013 bringing its benchmark interest rate down to 0.05% \u2013 in a bid to stimulate the country's recession-hit economy. Neil Shearing at Capital Economics said: Today's cut in interest rates was a surprise (both we and the consensus expected no change) and the fact that the announcement was delayed by an hour could be a sign that the decision was carried by the narrowest of majorities. Ireland is a shining example of how Europe can emerge from the crisis, German chancellor Angela Merkel said after her meeting with the Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny in Berlin. For his part, Kenny said Ireland is determined to return to the bond markets and is optimistic about exiting the bailout. He urged the Eurogroup to make Ireland's return to the market a priority. And he noted that Greece and some other countries face \"enormous challenges\". More jobs data from the US. (To recap, there is a lot of attention on the data out of the US today as we are getting some of the last major releases ahead of the elections on Tuesday). The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment fell last week, suggesting the job market's slow recovery is gaining traction. US weekly jobless claims came in at 363,000, slightly lower than forecasts of 370,000, and down from last week's 369,000. The four-week moving average (which smoothes out volatility) dropped to 367,250. Economists say a reading below 400,000 points to an increase in employment. The labour department said there were no signs that superstorm Sandy had any impact on the data. The UK economy has seen tentative green shoots, writes Capital Economics, but the good news might not last. The research house notes that last month saw some encouraging signs from the economy. Most obviously, the 1% rise in GDP in Q3 exceeded expectations. Meanwhile, employment growth has remained strong, there are tentative signs that the Funding for Lending Scheme is starting to work and broad money growth has accelerated. But the good news might not last for long; the economy could contract in the last quarter of the year. And abstracting from temporary factors, the UK\u2019s recovery still looks dismal. With a number of factors still constraining the recovery, we continue to expect growth of just 0.5% next year and would not rule out a triple-dip. More US jobs figures show private sector employment grew by 158,000 in October. The ADP survey beat expectations of a 135,000 rise, and was an improvement from September's revised increase of 88,000. However, the market does not take this report too seriously and it is thought recent changes to the methodology mean it will take a few months before people take it seriously. Joe Weisenthal, deputy editor of Business Insider, tweets: There's more good news out of Ireland (see 8.25am for buoyant manufacturing figures), where the number of people claiming unemployment benefit ticked down by 1,000 in October to 434,200. The Central Statistics Office said the unemployment rate has stuck at (a still high) 14.8%. Economists say that should inch down to 14.7% by the end of the year. The first of the US jobs data is out and it looks bad (although not that bad when taken in context). The Challenger, Grey and Christmas job cuts report counts the number of announced corporate layoffs and is used to measure the strength (or otherwise) of the jobs market. It showed that planned layoffs rose 41% in October. That's the highest since May, but still low by historical standards. Today sees the introduction of a European ban on naked shorts, which is not half as exciting as it sounds. Credit default swaps or CDS are often referred to as an insurance policy against a country defaulting. In fact, they are frequently used to bet that a country will default (or that its credit rating will decline) rather than to protect against any losses if it does. These new European rules ban traders taking that bet (otherwise known as short-selling), unless they already own a bond issued by that country, which would suggest they are genuinely taking out a form of insurance on that bond. But critics of the ban say the rules will only damage the market for CDS and have been brought in out of spite. James Mackintosh at the FT writes: The real problems of CDS, such as transparency and the complexity and number of contracts, have been dealt with. That leaves the true justification for the ban: no one likes a short seller. The trial of Kostas Vaxevanis, the journalist who published the names of Greeks with accounts in a Swiss bank, kicked off in Athens this morning. ekathimerini reports: Vaxevanis\u2019s weekly magazine, Hot Doc, published more than 2,000 names that he claims were on a list provided by French authorities to Greece in 2010. It has become known as the \u201cLagarde list\u201d after the French finance minister at the time. The account holders are estimated to have a combined total of some 1.5 billion euros in deposits. It has emerged that Greek authorities failed, for a number of reasons, to investigate whether the account holders had deposit[ed] the money legally. Reports are emerging on Twitter that journalists from the Greek state broadcaster are protesting against threats to press freedom. A reporter from Al Jazeera English tweets: British politicians have been out in force this morning, following the government's embarrassing defeat on EU spending last night. Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said this morning that Tory rebels have \"absolutely no hope\" of achieving their goal of forcing the EU to cut spending. He wants the UK to be \"unambiguously in the inner circle\", he says. The country shouldn't accept every edict from Brussels, but should co-operate where necessary, he said. Chancellor George Osborne was also out fighting the government's corner on Radio 4's Today programme this morning, but he suggested there was a chance of winning a cut in spending. The government needed to listen to all coalition MPs, he said, and \"the real test\" would be when the House of Commons was faced with a choice of whether to accept a deal or go for the alternative. \"Let us see what we bring home, if we think there's a good deal,\" he said. There's more fallout from the vote on the Politics live blog. Over in Germany, however, things are looking up. Economy minister Philipp R\u00f6esler said the German economy could expand 0.8% in 2012, and another 1% in 2013. Via Bloomberg's economics editor Linda Yueh. There's more fallout from the angry austerity talks in Greek parliament yesterday, after a prominent MP quit the socialist PASOK party (see 9.30am). ekathimerini reports that MP Michalis Kassis accused some of his colleagues of only supporting Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and the coalition government because they want to become ministers. He also told journalists that several more PASOK MPs intend to vote against the austerity package in Parliament. The vote is likely to take place next week. The three-party government had 177 out of 300 seats after already losing one MP from New Democracy and another from Democratic Left, which insists it will not support the latest package unless the troika backs down over labor reforms. Now there are talks of a leadership challenge. The former agriculture minister and a former candidate for the PASOK leadership, Kostas Skandalidis reportedly clashed with Venizelos over his handling of the party and refused afterwards to dismiss suggestions that there might be a challenge mounted against the party president. There are still many open questions regarding Greece within the troika of international lenders \u2013 the EU, the IMF and the ECB \u2013 a German official said this morning (via Reuters). There are still open questions, a whole series of open questions regarding Greece within the troika, but then also within the eurogroup. The official said Berlin wants a sustainable solution for Greece but it is not yet in sight. Greece would not be a central topic of the G20 meeting in Mexico, but will likely be discussed on the sidelines, the official added. The UK manufacturing data keeps open the possibility of more quantitative easing next week, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. However, unless the October service sector purchasing managers\u2019 survey is very weak we think it is more likely that the Bank of England will decide to sit tight on further stimulative action next Thursday and monitor how the economy develops. He notes that employment in the manufacturing sector fell for a second month running, \"which fuels concern that recent labour market strength may wane\". Overall, he expects modest GDP growth of around 0.2% in the fourth quarter, but says, \"the outlook is highly uncertain\". Robert Wood at Berenberg bank says dire UK manufacturing data means the services sector must grow to keep the economy from shrinking in the fourth quarter. This is just the latest reminder that we should not get too carried away by strong UK GDP growth in Q3. The internationally exposed manufacturing sector is suffering from the continued contraction in the eurozone and weaker global growth more broadly. Weak domestic demand isn\u2019t helping either. With manufacturing output falling, the UK is relying on services to keep overall GDP from returning to contraction in Q4. More analyst comment on the UK's dreary manufacturing data. Alan Clarke at Scotiabank says weak demand from abroad is dragging on the sector. This is a continuation of a theme that has been running all year; domestic fundamentals aren\u2019t great, but they have been improving. By contrast, the overseas sector is holding us back and that is particularly evident in export facing sectors such as manufacturing. The data will reignite the debate over whether the Bank of England will expand its quantitative easing (QE) programme next month. James Knightley at ING bank, writes: Following a recent run of slightly better data, this is a disappointment and with the eurozone sliding into a deeper recession we still feel there is a good chance of another round of QE being announced by the Bank of England next week. Comments from officials in the past couple of weeks have been fairly mixed so it is likely to be a close call, but with the economy remaining stagnant and external growth risks having barely changed we still take the view a narrow majority will vote in favour of a \u00a350bn expansion in the Asset Purchase Facility. Taking a closer look at the UK manufacturing data (see below), the reading of 47.5 was the worst in almost a year. There were sharp falls in output and new orders as export demand remains weak. New orders fell for the seventh month in a row and at a faster pace than in September. In one of the only bright spots, output in the consumer goods sector bounced back from September's contraction. David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, said: There is little in last month\u2019s figures to encourage the industry. Where once it looked like high growth areas in Asia might offer opportunities to offset the acutely fragile situation in the eurozone, it now looks like the global economic slowdown is stifling demand in Asia which is threatening to depress the manufacturing industry in the UK still further. Britain's downturn in manufacturing worsened in October as companies received fewer orders and costs rose. The Markit PMI dropped to 47.5 from 48.1 in September. That's below economist forecasts of 48. It's all kicking off in Greek politics again today. This morning a Socialist deputy quit his party, after party leader Evangelos Venizelos ordered the socialists to support the measures at all costs. Venizelos said yesterday: Whoever cannot follow this road should not, our paths should part. The moment of truth has come. That prompted Michalis Kassis to became an independent MP this morning, leaving the socialist Pasok party with 32 deputies in the 300 seat parliament, and the coalition with 175. There are reports that another senior member of the party (although not an MP), Marilena Xenoyannakopoulou, has also abandoned the party. (via @dianalizia) Xenoyannakopoulou was part of George Papandreou's inner circle. Over to Greece, where the news was bad but not exactly unexpected. Its three-year slump in manufacturing dragged on last month, hit by weak domestic demand and a marked decline in export orders. The PMI fell to 41 in October from 42.2 in September, well below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The index has languished in this territory since September 2009. Markit economist Phil Smith said: The health of Greece's manufacturing sector remained on a steep downward trajectory with no evidence of the tide turning int he sector's favour. A development of particular concern was an increase in the rate at which businesses cut staff. Sweden, Norway and Switzerland have all had manufacturing data out this morning, with unexpected results. Sweden, in particular, saw its October PMI drop to 43.1 from 44.7, falling further from the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. Analysts were hoping for an improvement to 45. In Norway, too, the manufacturing is shrinking faster than expected. Its PMI for October was 48.7, down from a revised figure of 49.1 for September, and compared with expectations that it would rise to 49.5. The Swiss manufacturing sector is also in decline, although things have improved since September. The PMI rose to 46.1 in October, compared with 43.6 in September. Janwillem Acket of Julius Baer said of the Swiss data: This is no surprise at all. We're in a technical recession already and we're heading for a very difficult winter. There's no growth in the eurozone in the first half of next year and this is all reflected in this PMI data. Quick look at the markets. The FTSE is higher after a string of upbeat results from UK companies, including Shell. But, with public holidays in France, Italy, Spain and bits of Germany, trading is expected to be thin. UK FTSE 100: up 0.33%, or 19 points, at 5802 Germany Dax: up 0.16% France CAC 40: down 0.08% Spain IBEX: down 0.3% Italy FTSE MIB: down 0.01% The economic data out of the UK this week and last has sent conflicting signals. My colleague Phillip Inman has a gloomy take on what it all means. He writes that weak figures from the manufacturing sector today and a repeat of the recent contraction in construction tomorrow could show that Britain is on course to suffer an unprecedented third recession in four years. That's the view of several leading economists, who warn that a triple-dip is a strong possibility after the UK recovered in the third quarter of the year \u2013 but only due to the Olympics and special factors that disguised the weak state of the economy. Back in the UK, house prices jumped by 0.6% in October, bringing the average cost of a property to \u00a3164,153. Nationwide's house price survey showed that prices were, however, down 0.9% from the same month last year. Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner said the annual rate of change showed \"a picture of relative stability\". Although the UK economy has been adding jobs in recent quarters, even in the midst of recession, conditions remain very difficult for households. Wage growth is still not keeping up with the cost of living and unemployment is still well above normal levels. This helps to explain why housing market activity has remained subdued, with the number of mortgage approvals still running at little more than half their long-run average. Both Irish and Chinese manufacturing data paint a fairly rosy picture this morning. First off, Ireland. Its manufacturing sector grew for the eighth month in a row in October, driven by stronger demand from export markets. The NCB purchasing manager's index climbed to 52.1 from 51.8 in September, comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. (The PMI summarises the opinions of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector, who gauge future demand and adjust orders for materials accordingly.) Over in China, official and private surveys of the manufacturing sector suggested growth could be picking up again in the world's second-largest economy. The National Bureau of Statistics reported the official October PMI rose to 50.2 from 49.8 in September. While, the HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 49.5 in October from 47.9 in September. We've already had manufacturing data out of Ireland and China this morning, more on that shortly. And there's plenty more releases out during the day. UK Nationwide house price survey: 7am Sweden PMI for October: 7.30am Norway PMI for October: 8am Switzerland retail sales for September: 8.30am UK manufacturing PMI for October: 9.30am US employment report for October: 12.15pm US weekly jobless claims: 12.30pm US consumer confidence for October: 2pm US ISM manufacturing for October: 2pm In the debt markets, the UK will issue an index-linked Treasury gilt, while the US is selling three and six-month bills. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. There were more protests in Athens last night after the government said it would overshoot its deficit and debt targets again next year because the recession was deeper than feared. But today, all eyes are on the UK manufacturing data, out at 9.30am. Britain emerged from recession in the third quarter but these will give some indication of whether the economy is still growing in the fourth. Later on, Angela Merkel is hosting the Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny in Berlin, as part of a series of meetings in the run-up to Ireland\u2019s EU presidency. A spokesman for the Irish government said: The discussions between the Taoiseach and the chancellor are expected to address the Government\u2019s priorities for the Irish presidency, progress in relation to the Irish financial programme, bilateral relations between the two countries and European developments including challenges in the Euro zone. The last major economic releases are coming out of the US ahead of the presidential elections. Jobs data is out first, followed by manufacturing at 2pm.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Plans to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing appear to be on the rocks after figures showed activity in the sector contracted for the sixth straight month in October. The CIPS/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 47.5 from a downwardly revised 48.1 in September, dipping further below the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction. The downturn worsened as companies received fewer orders and costs rose at a faster pace than in September, forcing firms to cut jobs and scale back investment plans. News that manufacturers are continuing to cut production will sound alarm bells in the Treasury and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which have argued for a shift in policy towards creating the conditions that favour industrial production. The Treasury is also concerned that a weaker manufacturing sector will drag the economy back into the third recession in four years when official figures for GDP in the fourth quarter are published early next year. The UK has just emerged from its second recession since the financial crash following a 1% rise in national income in the third quarter. But economists put most of the rise down to one-off factors and many have predicted another period of contraction as the slowdown in global growth and government austerity measures take their toll. The October figure is below economists' forecasts of 48.0 and may throw the debate about the chances of more stimulus from the Bank of England open again. Several economists changed their view following strong economic growth of 1% in the third quarter, expecting no extension of the BoE's government bond purchases at next week's policy meeting. But manufacturers cut production for a fourth month in a row and new orders fell at a faster rate than in September as export demand dwindled, the PMI data showed. Markit economist Rob Dobson said: \"While the road to an export-led recovery is still blocked by the ongoing difficulties in the eurozone, it is concerning to hear further reports of the global slowdown hurting trade with other regions such as Asia.\" The index for new orders fell to 47.7 in October from 49.9 in the previous month. The report said that signs of spare capacity encouraged some manufacturers to reduce employment, mainly in reaction to a fall in the backlog of work. Alarmingly, backlogs of work fell for the twenty-first consecutive month in October, with the rate of contraction sharper than the long run average for the PMI series. \"Manufacturers remained cost-cautious overall, leading to lower levels of purchasing and further depletion of inventory holdings. The rate of reduction in input buying volumes accelerated sharply and was one of the fastest signalled during the past three-and-a-half years. Meanwhile, margins were squeezed further, as cost inflation hit a seven-month peak at a time when pricing power remained muted,\" the report said. The only comfort for the government is that most other European countries have suffered a downturn manufacturing output. Figures for Sweden on Thursday showed the Nordic country's manufacturing PMI fell to 43.1. Dobson also noted some positive signs. \"The consumer goods sector bounced back robustly in October to really buck the wider trend,\" he said. \"This chimes with ongoing signs that domestic retail sales volumes are holding up reasonably well.\" Business lobby CBI raised its forecast slightly for this year and next on Thursday after the bounce in the third quarter, predicting a stagnation in 2012 and 1.4 percent growth in 2013. Bank of England policymakers have cautioned that the strong growth from the third quarter was unlikely to be repeated. In a worrying sign for the central bankers, companies' costs rose at the fastest pace since March. Firms also increased their prices at a much slower rate, squeezing profit margins.",

      "body": "<p>Plans to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing appear to be on the rocks after figures showed activity in the sector contracted for the sixth straight month in October.</p> <p>The CIPS/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 47.5 from a downwardly revised 48.1 in September, dipping further below the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction.</p> <p>The downturn worsened as companies received fewer orders and costs rose at a faster pace than in September, forcing firms to cut jobs and scale back investment plans.</p> <p>News that manufacturers are continuing to cut production will sound alarm bells in the Treasury and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which have argued for a shift in policy towards creating the conditions that favour industrial production.</p> <p>The Treasury is also concerned that a weaker manufacturing sector will drag the economy back into the third recession in four years when official figures for GDP in the fourth quarter are published early next year.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/uk-emerges-from-double-dip-recession-george-osborne\" title=\"\">UK has just emerged from its second recession since the financial crash</a> following a 1% rise in national income in the third quarter. But economists put most of the rise down to one-off factors and many have predicted another period of contraction as the slowdown in global growth and government austerity measures take their toll.</p> <p>The October figure is below economists' forecasts of 48.0 and may throw the debate about the chances of more stimulus from the Bank of England open again.</p> <p>Several economists changed their view following strong economic growth of 1% in the third quarter, expecting no extension of the BoE's government bond purchases at next week's policy meeting.</p> <p>But manufacturers cut production for a fourth month in a row and new orders fell at a faster rate than in September as export demand dwindled, the PMI data showed.</p> <p>Markit economist Rob Dobson said: \"While the road to an export-led recovery is still blocked by the ongoing difficulties in the eurozone, it is concerning to hear further reports of the global slowdown hurting trade with other regions such as Asia.\" The index for new orders fell to 47.7 in October from 49.9 in the previous month.</p> <p>The report said that signs of spare capacity encouraged some manufacturers to reduce employment, mainly in reaction to a fall in the backlog of work. Alarmingly, backlogs of work fell for the twenty-first consecutive month in October, with the rate of contraction sharper than the long run average for the PMI series.</p> <p>\"Manufacturers remained cost-cautious overall, leading to lower levels of purchasing and further depletion of inventory holdings. The rate of reduction in input buying volumes accelerated sharply and was one of the fastest signalled during the past three-and-a-half years. Meanwhile, margins were squeezed further, as cost inflation hit a seven-month peak at a time when pricing power remained muted,\" the report said.</p> <p>The only comfort for the government is that most other European countries have suffered a downturn manufacturing output. Figures for Sweden on Thursday showed the Nordic country's manufacturing PMI fell to 43.1.</p> <p>Dobson also noted some positive signs. \"The consumer goods sector bounced back robustly in October to really buck the wider trend,\" he said. \"This chimes with ongoing signs that domestic retail sales volumes are holding up reasonably well.\"</p> <p>Business lobby CBI raised its forecast slightly for this year and next on Thursday after the bounce in the third quarter, predicting a stagnation in 2012 and 1.4 percent growth in 2013.</p> <p>Bank of England policymakers have cautioned that the strong growth from the third quarter was unlikely to be repeated.</p> <p>In a worrying sign for the central bankers, companies' costs rose at the fastest pace since March. Firms also increased their prices at a much slower rate, squeezing profit margins.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 6,000 jobs are at risk as the troubled high-street electricals chain Comet teeters on the edge of administration. Comet, the UK's second largest electrical specialist after Dixons, has struggled to make headway as supermarkets and online retailers such as Amazon targeted the cut-throatmarket, and could go into administration as soon as Thursday. It is estimated to have made a loss of \u00a335m in the year to 30 April. In a sign of the toughness of the market US giant Best Buy pulled out of the UK last year after struggling to gain a foothold. Industry sources said Comet faced a cash crunch after trade insurers cut credit lines to suppliers, forcing them to ask for payment for goods upfront. Deloitte is understood to be waiting in the wings to handle the administration of the 240 stores, although they are expected to remain open for business in the meantime. The retailer has been hard hit by the collapse in consumer spending caused by the financial crisis, and French company Kesa paid OpCapita \u00a350m to take the loss-making chain off its hands just nine months ago. OpCapita paid a token \u00a32 for the chain. Comet's failure would be more bad news for a retail sector that has been hit by a series of collapses this year, including household names such as JJB Sports, Game, Peacocks and Blacks Leisure. Although the brands still survive, the subsequent restructurings have resulted in hundreds of store closures and thousands of job losses. Last month more than 2,000 jobs were lost at JJB alone after administrators were unable to find a buyer for the stricken sportswear chain. The spate of collapses has contributed to the blight of empty shops on Britain's high streets, with a recent report from PwC and the Local Data Company calculating an average of 30 store closures a day in July and August. In the original sales document, OpCapita had promised to keep Comet going for 18 months and its rapid decline will attract scrutiny of its stewardship. In a previous guise the same firm, which is run by former investment banker Henry Jackson, took over the running of furniture chain MFI in 2006 after securing a \u00a3130m dowry from its owner. It was sold on two years later but fell into administration soon after the deal went through. In an interview this year with the Financial Times, Jackson, the former head of Deutsche Bank's consumer and retail practice, insisted its strategy was not to make money from winding down businesses. \"We are not liquidators. We don't look at businesses based on realising asset value,\" he said. \"What we are about is operational change.\" OpCapita had drafted in industry heavyweight John Clare, a former chief executive at Dixons, to lead the turnaround of Comet. On OpCapita's watch, staff numbers have been reduced from nearly 10,000 to 6,500 as it cut costs and closed stores. In a recent interview Clare said trading had stabilised but last month the mood music changed after reports that OpCapita had received unsolicited approaches from rival groups interested in buying it although industry sources suggested there was little appetite for the chain, describing it as a \"basket case\". Reports that the business could change hands again were said to have caused suppliers to toughen their terms for dealing with the retailer, magnifying its financial problems. OpCapita took on little financial risk when it bought Comet and the source suggested the firm would not be out of pocket in the event of an administration. OpCapita bought about 300 Game stores from its administrators. Comet was previously part of stock market listed Kesa, which has since renamed itself Darty and the former parent remains on the hook for Comet's pension scheme which is thought to be around \u00a340m in the red. It is unclear whether the administration of Comet would be a precursor to a sale, or result in a break up with stores sold off to other retailers. Comet and OpCapita could not be reached for comment.",

In a previous guise the same firm, which is run by former investment banker Henry Jackson, took over the running of furniture chain MFI in 2006 after securing a \u00a3130m dowry from its owner. It was sold on two years later but fell into administration soon after the deal went through.</p> <p>In an interview this year with the Financial Times, Jackson, the former head of Deutsche Bank's consumer and retail practice, insisted its strategy was not to make money from winding down businesses. \"We are not liquidators. We don't look at businesses based on realising asset value,\" he said. \"What we are about is operational change.\"</p> <p>OpCapita had drafted in industry heavyweight John Clare, a former chief executive at Dixons, to lead the turnaround of Comet. On OpCapita's watch, staff numbers have been reduced from nearly 10,000 to 6,500 as it cut costs and closed stores. In a recent interview Clare said trading had stabilised but last month the mood music changed after reports that OpCapita had received unsolicited approaches from rival groups interested in buying it although industry sources suggested there was little appetite for the chain, describing it as a \"basket case\".</p> <p>Reports that the business could change hands again were said to have caused suppliers to toughen their terms for dealing with the retailer, magnifying its financial problems.</p> <p>OpCapita took on little financial risk when it bought Comet and the source suggested the firm would not be out of pocket in the event of an administration. OpCapita bought about 300 Game stores from its administrators.</p> <p>Comet was previously part of stock market listed Kesa, which has since renamed itself Darty and the former parent remains on the hook for Comet's pension scheme which is thought to be around \u00a340m in the red.</p> <p>It is unclear whether the administration of Comet would be a precursor to a sale, or result in a break up with stores sold off to other retailers. Comet and OpCapita could not be reached for comment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's leading employers' organisation has warned of a \"new normal\" of lacklustre growth as it predicted that the economy's long haul out of recession would last for at least a further two years. John Cridland, director-general of the CBI, called on George Osborne to increase spending on public infrastructure in next month's pre-budget report to help spread prosperity beyond London and its immediate hinterland. While ruling out a Japanese-style \"lost decade\", Cridland said: \"There is a new normal. We have to get used to steadier growth but it doesn't mean a decade of no growth at all.\" After previous recessions, the UK economy has bounced back and recouped output lost in the downturn through several years of growth above its long-term trend of 2.5% per annum. Cridland said the UK faced challenging times in which growth would be muted. He backed the growth report published by the former Conservative deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine, saying it offered the prospect of growth based on key regional cities. He added: \"London is like an ancient Greek city state, the dynamo of the economy but different in character to the rest of the country. For the economy to be rebalanced we need to get investment across the country and export growth across the country. Not all the growth can be from London and the south-east. \"If rebalancing requires the private sector to take up the slack from the public sector, that is hard in those regions where so much employment and activity are delivered by the public sector.\" Cridland said the CBI supported the government in its aim of reducing Britain's budget deficit but said the \u00a323bn cut in capital spending had been excessive. \"That's gone too far.\" We are not spending enough on infrastructure.\" The employers' group said it expected the economy to gradually pick up speed over the coming two years, with zero growth in 2012 followed by a 1.4% in 2013 and 2% in 2014. Publishing its quarterly economic forecasts, the CBI said it was slightly more optimistic about this year and next following the unexpectedly strong official figures for the third quarter of 2012. These showed activity picking up by 1%, stronger than the 0.6% the CBI had pencilled in. Cridland said that there were downside risks to the forecast mostly stemming from overseas. The CBI is concerned about the uncertainty caused by the US \"fiscal cliff\", the package of tax increases and spending cuts due to be implemented in early 2013 following last year's deal between the White House and Congress. Although the employers' organisation said it expected a deal to prevent a 4% reduction to GDP in the US from the planned measures, it believes political brinkmanship in Washington could undermine global business confidence. Uncertainty about the future of the eurozone is also expected to damage sentiment. The CBI said the biggest domestic threat to its forecast came from inflation, now forecast to be higher in 2013 than previously predicted as a result of increases in utility prices. Despite the recent \"puzzling\" resilience of the labour market, a small rise in unemployment was possible in 2013 as a result of the lagged effects of sluggish activity in the first half of 2012. Labour market conditions are expected to improve steadily from the second half of 2013 and throughout 2014, with the jobless rate dropping to 7.7% from 7.9% now. Cridland said: \"Despite the better than expected third quarter performance, the UK economy has bumped along the bottom this year, with overall growth fairly flat. \"While we expect underlying momentum to pick up modestly next year and to be slightly stronger in 2014, the pace will remain relatively lacklustre. But major external risks including continuing uncertainty in the eurozone, and risks to inflation, will hit confidence and growth for some time to come.\"",
