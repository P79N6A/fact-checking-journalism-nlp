      "body": "<p>There are some, like <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/rip-the-confidence-fairy-2013-1\">Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider</a>, who disagreed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/30/us-economy-gdp-shrink-congress-fiscal-cliff\">with my argument earlier about the responsibility of the fiscal cliff vacillation in Washington for the weak fourth-quarter performance of the US economy</a>.</p> <p>Joe, for instance, argues that the drop in business inventory was expected, and that businesses spent more money on software, which shows some measure of confidence despite the fiscal cliff. He calls worries about the fiscal cliff the result of the \"Confidence Fairy\", which seems to bless certain economic outcomes with the alleged sparkledust of business confidence. But like Santa Claus, the Confidence Fairy is not real, according to Joe. </p> <p>There are a couple of major problems with Joe's argument that the fiscal cliff had no effect on GDP. </p> <p>The first problem is that one of the biggest contributors to the drop in GDP was the huge drop in defense spending. There would have been no other reason for such a big drop except for the fiscal cliff. So, if nothing else, the fiscal cliff, by hurting defense spending, affected GDP by at least 1.3 percentage points. <a href=\"http://www.rbc.com/economics/market/daily_us.html\">As RBC analysts wrote today</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The slowing in overall GDP growth in Q4 largely resulted from a moderation in the pace of inventory building, weakness in net trade, and an outsized drop in the often volatile government defense component that may have reflected precautionary cuts ahead of the so-called fiscal cliff.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Joe also maintains that business spending on equipment and software actually increased. This is true. That kind of spending jumped by 12.4% in the last three months of the year \u2013 \"the third-biggest jump since the economic recovery started in the middle of 2009\", as <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/01/30/fiscal-cliff-didnt-hold-back-business-spending/\">the Wall Street Journal points out</a>. Joe reasons businesses would not have spent that money unless they believed the economy would be good, so the fiscal cliff must have been a fake concern. </p> <p>But that may be based on only a shallow reading of the numbers. I would say just the opposite: business spending is a false friend as far as measures of growth go. It does not predict confidence. Very often, it predicts that businesses do <em>not</em> trust consumer demand to rise, and that they plan to squeeze more out of existing workers. </p> <p>Here's how that works: Business spending started going up two years ago. The expectation was that businesses were investing in themselves to ramp up in response to greater demand for their products. That would eventually result in more hiring. </p> <p>But business spending has not actually signalled greater demand or more hiring. Instead, it's a sign that businesses are squeezing more work out of their workers. That means they have to update their machines or their software - often after years of putting it off. But it doesn't trickle down to the rest of the economy \u2013 or at least, it hasn't for nearly two years. </p> <p>So I would respond to Joe by saying that business spending is not a sign of confidence \u2013 it's a sign of the opposite, that businesses plan to continue squeezing more out of their workers without hiring more. Only when businesses really start to hire on a grand scale can we believe they believe that the economy is strong enough to support more demand for products from consumers. But business leaders have been complaining that the demand just isn't there; that doesn't appear to have changed, in their opinion. </p> <p>Another way you can judge that the fiscal cliff definitely had an effect: Business investment in buildings fell by a significant amount \u2013 1.1% in the fourth quarter alone. Any real estate investment requires a pretty good understanding of what tax rates will be. Since the fiscal cliff caused businesses to be completely unsure of what their tax rates would be, we can also attribute the drop in business investment in buildings to the fiscal cliff. </p> <p>Lastly, Joe argues that the fiscal cliff was irrelevant because the drop in inventories was largely expected. That's true about inventories, but it's an issue of quantity. The inventory numbers were not expected to drop so low. In most economic numbers \u2013 as with company earnings \u2013 the major issue is not the drop; it's the surprise of it. Was it expected? If so, it means that our understanding of the economy is on track. If not, it means there is a contradiction in our premises and there is a reason to dig deeper. </p> <p>So it is with inventories. If inventories dropped by such a surprising amount, it doesn't mean that retailers are selling more than expected; it means that they're probably afraid to order more, because they're worried about demand. What leads to this conclusion is that retail sales were not particularly good, except for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. People did most of their shopping early in the season and then didn't keep spending. </p> <p>You have to wonder why inventories dropped so much; you would need a shock of some sort to explain it. The fiscal cliff is one such shock; Hurricane Sandy could be another. But it's very hard to argue that businesses were confident, based on that surprising plummet in inventories. </p> <p>Joe also points to consumer spending as a signal that the fiscal cliff had little or not effect on the economy. This really doesn't make a dent; consumers were largely unaware of the fiscal cliff and did not factor it into their thinking, according to numerous polls. The key to judging the effect of the fiscal cliff is to look at what businesses are thinking; they were the ones who were educated about the issues and who have any kind of control over the levers that move the economy.</p> <p>Consumers showed evident fatigue about Washington's reindeer games and just went about their business; their behavior is largely divorced from the fiscal cliff debate of last year. (Though it is likely that consumers will react to the increase in the payroll tax this year; it's less money in their paychecks.)</p> <p>Another issue that Joe brings up in support of his point against the fiscal cliff is another, separate measure: durable goods orders. These are big, heavy items, and when those orders rise, it's generally a good sign for the economy. Orders jumped by 4.6% in December, which is significant. </p> <p>But this number, too, is misleading. As <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323829504578269613282305052.html\">the Wall Street Journal notes</a>, the rise in durable goods was not because businesses were suddenly full of confidence. Instead, \"the rise was fueled by stepped-up spending on aircraft and defense products, two volatile categories that can obscure the real picture.\" In fact, if you take out transportation equipment, the Journal notes, durable goods order rose only 1.3%. That's good news, but hardly a sign of business confidence going gangbusters. </p> <p>The fiscal cliff certainly put a dent in the economic numbers, at least for the fourth quarter. It certainly did not help them. Confidence does not come in fairy form, but it does count, because human beings are not automatons. The biggest mistake economists make is to assume that all decisions are economically rational; we know that for a fact to be untrue, though. People make irrational decisions, and some of those people are CEOs. If they feel fear, they won't spend money. In fact, that is the threat that CEOs have been making for years in response to Washington policy and regulation.</p> <p>The fact is, that there are very few economists who would dismiss the effect of the fiscal cliff out of hand. The economy clearly received a shock in the fourth quarter. Polina Vlasenko, a research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research, noted that the fiscal cliff was one of the factors holding back the economy in the fourth quarter, enough to require a recovery:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"As the economy recovers from the effects of Sandy and the fiscal impasse in Washington, we expect to see a rebound in growth in the first quarter of 2013. This forecast is supported by the fact that consumer spending, the main driver of the US economy, continues to grow steadily.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Confidence Fairy does not exist. But what does exist is the very real effect of Washington policy changes on very real taxes and very real government spending. Washington was talking about extreme, tangible changes worth hundreds of billions of dollars.</p> <p>Any CEO or business owner who would have ignored that and blithely continued to spend would have been an impractical business person. There is no sparkle dust that will distort that reality.</p>",

The economic challenge of our times is the design of a system that enables us to gracefully contract while reducing inequality. Schumacher's writing provides a strikingly contemporary moral and theoretical compass to guide us in this work. Jonathan Dawson Head of economics, Schumacher College",

      "bodyText": "Alison Carnwath, who used to be responsible for setting pay at Barclays, shed light on divisions on the bank's board last year when she claimed to have been a lone voice in recommending former boss Bob Diamond receive \"zero\" bonus. But her successor as chairman of the Barclays remuneration committee, Sir John Sunderland, stunned the banking standards commission when he said that he continued to believe that Diamond \u2013 who left last July just days after the bank was fined \u00a3290m for rigging Libor \u2013 should have been awarded \"a form of incentive compensation\" . Sunderland, who is in talks with shareholders about a bonus for Diamond's successor Antony Jenkins, conceded that with hindsight he would have \"debated the quantum\" of the bonus to Diamond, but not the principle of awarding one. Diamond was handed a \u00a32.7m bonus for 2011 and a total of \u00a317m before the bank picked up his tax bill of \u00a35.7m. Carnwath said Diamond \u2013 who she said was known for his \"generous pay packet\" \u2013 was reluctant to accept pay at the bank was high and was overly protective of the investment banking arm he headed before stepping up to chief executive. Carnwath quit by the end of July, just weeks after Diamond, and in the aftermath of a rebellion against her re-election to the board at the annual meeting in April. She had been unable to attend the crucial board meeting last February when Diamond's pay was rubber stamped and at which, the bank insists, the decision over the bonus was unanimous. Carnwath, chairman of Land Securities, described pay at banks in some instances as \"obscene\". She said in written evidence that Diamond should have set an example by not taking the bonus recommended by the former chairman Marcus Agius. Carnwath told MPs and peers on the commission she thought a \"culture of entitlement\" had emerged over bankers' bonuses and that she had been \"amazed\" by Agius' recommendation, given the performance of the bank and political atmosphere. In her written evidence, she said: \"Barclays' returns in 2011 were not good from a shareholder's perspective with the key measure of [return on equity] ... not covering the cost of capital and the share price and dividends showing poor returns. It was for this reason that I disagreed with the board chairman's recommendation on Mr Diamond's annual bonus for 2011.\" She added: \"I recommended zero. I was alone in my view both on the committee which I chaired and on the board.\" She said the remuneration committee was \"aware that pay was at the top end of the scale\" and had asked Diamond \"to take a leadership position and clarify the pay culture to staff\". Sunderland rebutted claims that the Barclays' structured capital markets division \u2013 best known for its tax avoidance schemes \u2013 had in one year generated 110% of the bank profits. A member of the Barclays board since 2005, his defence of payment protection insurance \u2014 the industry's biggest ever mis-selling scandal \u2014 was described as \"rubbish\" by commission member Lord Turnbull. Carnwath said that Diamond \"thought he found loyalty in people around him by paying them well, in my view more than he needed to\". Separately, HSBC set up a new boardroom committee charged with cracking down on financial crime following its \u00a31.2bn fine for money laundering.

The company is struggling to catch up with rival Inditex, the owner of the Zara chain, which continues strong growth, making the move to the fast-growing Chinese market more quickly and staying on top of fashion trends. H&amp;M plans to open about 50 stores in China on top of the 123 already in place. It is also revamping its website and launching new retail brands to try to broaden its appeal. Rahul Sharma, an analyst at VWO Consulting, said: \"H&amp;M is a value retailer selling low-price clothing. It should be doing well in this environment.\" He said the chain had not had sufficiently exciting products and had put off shoppers by raising prices in order to cope with the increased cost of cotton last year. Rivals such as Primark have continued to grow strongly during the downturn by absorbing the higher costs to keep prices competitive and Sharma said H&amp;M was now having to follow suit. Karl-Johan Persson, the chief executive, said trading in many countries had been \"even more challenging in 2012 compared to 2011.\" He said H&amp;M would open 325 new stores in 2013 and enter Chile, Estonia, Lithuania, Serbia and Indonesia for the first time. It will also open its first stores for its new &amp; Other Stories brand this spring in Spain, Germany, Denmark, UK, Italy, France and Sweden.",

      "bodyText": "And with Europe's markets closed, we're finished for the day. Here's an brisk summary: \u2022 Spain's recession has deepened. GDP fell by a worse-than expected 0.7% in the last three months as rising unemployment and austerity cutbacks hit its economy (see 8.01am onwards) \u2022 America's economic growth has come to a surprise halt. GDP fell by 0.1% on an annualised basis (or around -0.025% in European terms) (see 1.40pm onwards) The fall was driven by a drop in exports, government spending and inventory levels. Several experts said it was no reason to panic, but there is concern that US growth could falter in 2013 as new fiscal tightning come into effect. \u2022 There were clashes in Greece between riot police and union members (see 3.27pm). \u2022 European stock markets fell, led by Italy (see 5.42pm). We'll be back tomorrow. Until then, thank you and goodnight! Europe's stock markets have suffered their biggest daily fall in a month, with a tumbling Italian market to blame. FTSE 100: down 16 points at 6323, - 0.25% German DAX: down 37 points at 7811, -0.47% French CAC: down 20 points at 3765, - 0.5% Spanish IBEX: down 71 points at 8571, -0.8% Italian FTSE MIB: down 602 points at 17289, -3.36% Italy's selloff was led by Italian oil services group Saipem, whose shares fell by a third following last night's shock profits warning. Italian banks are also under pressure as the Monte dei Paschi scandal raises fears over the health of the sector. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets commented: Major European indices have paused for breath, trading weaker through most of the day after the recent concerted rally which has seen multi-year highs. The pause is likely a direct consequence of this afternoon\u2019s surprise contraction in US Q4 GDP ahead of this evening\u2019s Fed statement, although we are not expecting any major surprises. Our US finance and economics editor, Heidi Moore, says US politicians must take the blame for the sudden halt in American economic growth. Their squabbling over the fiscal cliff late last year alarmed business leaders, she says, encouraging them to run down their stocks (as measured by inventory levels) in case of a real crisis: Heidi writes: This should serve as a lesson to Washington to stop any more stupid manufactured crises. There is no reason that grown men and women, sworn to serve the US, should torpedo its economy in a petty refusal to negotiate over vital economic issues. The fiscal cliff fight was a notable failure on the part of the nation's lawmakers. There may be more ahead: even though Congress came to a last-minute deal on New Year's Day, it wasn't a real agreement. All it did was put off the decisions on the spending cuts and tax hikes for a few more months. Gemma Godfrey, head of investment strategy for wealth management firm Brooks Macdonald, argues that the small drop in US economic output (see 1.40pm onwards) shows investors may have got carried away in recent weeks. She warns that the stock market rally may prove fragile: As investors dismiss the economic contraction to focus on the resilience of consumption, they miss the risk that this will come under pressure over the coming months as fiscal cliff measures come into play. Market rallies have been driven by the fear of an imminent risk receding, but growth is now needed for another leg up in markets. Instead, the \u2018pain trade\u2019 is now missing out on equity upside, implying fear of underperformance may be driving investment versus conviction in the outlook for markets going forward. Exemplifying this is the recent rotation by Hedge funds into financial stocks, following the positive earnings momentum, which of course is backward over-the-shoulder looking, rather than based on confidence in the future. Here's Dominic Rushe, our Wall Street correspondent, on the surprise drop in US GDP in the last quarter: The US economic recovery juddered to a halt in the final months of 2012 as government slashed defense spending, businesses cut back, and Washington fought over the fiscal cliff budget crisis. The nation's gross domestic product (GDP) shrank for the first time in three and a half years during the fourth quarter, dropping at an annual rate of 0.1%, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. It was the US's worst economic performance since October 2009, and came as economists had been expecting mild growth of around 1%. More here. I've now got hold of some photos from Athens, where union members broke into the office of the labor minister, and were then ejected by riot police. According to those at the scene, the riot police used tear gas to force the demonstrators out of the building. It also appears that at least one protestor was hurt - he's shown lying on the ground being helped by another union member. As explained at 11.22am, around 30 members of the communist-affiliated PAME union invaded Yiannis Vroutsis's office after the minister made comments about \"clientelism in the social security sector\" And Wall Street opens all-but flat, with the Dow Jones up a bold 1.6 points in early trading.... It's possible to put a positive spin on the dire-looking US GDP figure, says our economics correspondent Phillip Inman: From the figures we can see that businesses, caught with an excess of stock in their warehouses in the third quarter, cut back on orders in the final three months of the year, slicing 1.27 percentage points from fourth-quarter GDP growth. Excluding the cut in inventories, the economy grew at a healthier 1.1%. Also, consumer and business spending were up, and household disposable incomes increased. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose at a 2.2% , accelerating from the previous quarter's 1.6% growth rate. And as Reuters points out: Business investment rebounded after its first drop in 1.5 years in the prior quarter. The housing market was another bright spot. Residential construction grew at a 15.3 percent rate after notching a 13.5 percent growth pace in the third quarter. Homebuilding added to growth last year for the first time since 2005. Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, agrees that today's unexpected fall in US GDP isn't a disaster. He called the 0.1% drop in output (annualised) a \"manageable setback\", following a strong third quarter: Falls in public spending at the national and local levels as well as a drop in export revenue driven by the Eurozone crisis were the main culprits. Despite a rise in household consumption, de-stocking by businesses pushed output into negative territory for the quarter after a strong inventory build-up in the previous three months. With US house prices rising, the US economy appears to have started 2013 well. However, concerns remain: Business and consumer confidence have dropped amid the fiscal stand-off between Democrats and Republicans. Uncertainty around the effects of fiscal consolidation are weighing on domestic demand already, evident in slowing retail sales and trade growth. Public spending cuts will add to the mix, suggesting that the year ahead is going to see limited growth. After the immediate shock, the early reaction to the 0.1% drop in annualised US GDP is that it's not as bad as it sounds. Not exactly great, but not a reason to panic. Here's an early round-up: The surprise fall in US GDP in the last quarter was due to several factors 1) a 5.7% drop in exports 2) a 6.6% decline in government spending, which included a 22.2% fall in defense spending 3) a big drop in private inventories, which knocked 1.3% off GDP But more encouragingly, consumer spending rose by 2.2% and business investment was 8.8% higher. That doesn't suggest a country in serious trouble.... And now a real shock \u2013 the US economy shrank in the last three months of 2012. Annualised GDP* fell by 0.1%, much worse than analyst expectations of a 1.0% rise. This is the first time that US GDP has fallen since the second quarter of 2009. More to follow. * so on a quarter-on-quarter basis output was around 0.025% lower. Upbeat comments from the Portuguese prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, today. He told reporters in Lisbon that Portugal's recession will slow this year, meaning a return to growth in 2014. Passos Coelho said: All forecasts point in one direction, that in 2014 the Portuguese economy will recover in terms of growth and that throughout 2013 a turnaround in the recessive trend will occur. The key for Portugal's economic future is whether it exits its IMF-led bailout and returns to the markets in 2014... Another day, and another piece of decent economic news from America. 192,000 private sector jobs were created across the US economy in January, according to the ADP index. That's more than economists expected, and suggests the US economy is growing well now that the fiscal cliff debacle is over. Here's Tim Kirkham, director of risk advisory services at currency specialist HiFX, on the deepening Spanish recession: Spain has been in the headlines since the beginning of the eurozone crisis. It suffers from record high unemployment, negative growth and a significant deficit shock could be just around the corner, which may reignite fears about the country\u2019s fiscal situation and increase the risk of a ratings downgrade in the near term. The release of the preliminary 2012 budget-deficit figures on February 22nd will be key. Spanish officials have already paved the way for slippage, as they did in 2011, so we can pretty much count on a bigger number than the 7.3% of GDP (including 1 percentage point for bank recapitalisation) the government estimated in November. Over in Brussels, David Cameron's plan for a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU has been blasted by Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban. Orban called the pending in-out vote \"the most dangerous thing I can imagine\". My colleague Ian Traynor was there, and reports: Being criticised by Orban might irk Cameron - given the criticism of the Hungarian leader's attempts to interfere with its central bank. Italy has successfully auctioned 10-year government bonds at the lowest borrowing costs since October 2010. The Italian treasury sold \u20ac3.5bn of 10-year bonds at average yields of 4.17%, down from 4.48% in December. It also sold another \u20ac3bn of five-year bonds at yields of 2.94% (down from 3.26% last time) - meaning it hit the top of its target of raising \u20ac4.5bn to \u00a36.5bn. As Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy points out, Italian bond auctions are now routine, when once they were quite exciting: Just over three weeks to go to a critical parliamentary election, and Italy's government bond market shows no signs of nervousness. Quite the opposite - it's increasingly resilient to domestic political and economic risks. While demand at today's auction was not particularly impressive, the Treasury still managed to get all its debt out the door at cheaper rates, reflecting the dramatic improvement in sentiment towards the eurozone periphery in the face of severe economic weakness. Spiro adds, though, that next month's general election could shake this cosy consensus: If the outcome of the election is a deeply fragmented parliament, which is increasingly likely, the prospects for a stable, reform-minded and harmonious coalition government are slim. Reports from Athens that 30 members of the communist-affiliated PAME union briefly invaded the office of employment minister Yiannis Vroutsis, before being evicted: Via Kathimerini: The unionists were protesting comments made by the minister on Tuesday regarding clientelism in the social security sector. Riot police forces subsequently raided the ministry and removed the unionists. No photos yet..... European stock markets are mostly treading water this morning, with no sign that the deepening Spanish recession is alarming the City. FTSE 100: up 7 points at 6346, + 0.11% German DAX: down 13 points at 7835, -0.17% French CAC: down 4 points at 3781, -0.1% Spanish IBEX: up 1 point at 8644, +0.02% Traders say this could be the new normal... Italy's FTSE MIB is the big faller, though, down 344 points or 1.9% at 17548. That follows a shock profit warning from Italian oil services firm Saipem, which slashed earnings forecast by 80% last night. While Spain's recession deepens, the head of Austria's central bank has suggested that he may revise up his forecasts for Austrian and German growth this year. Ewald Nowotny, who also serves on the European Central Bank's governing council, said there were signs for optimism. The confidence indicators such as the Ifo index that we are receiving show an upwards trend - admittedly, one must soberly say, with low growth rates as a whole. And asked whether he saw 'positive contagion'* flowing to the real economy from the financial markets, Nowotny replied: To a certain, careful extent. * - Mario Draghi coined this phrase at the ECB's last monthly press conference In better news, economic confidence across the eurozone rose in January, for the third month in a row. The European commission found the confidence in all sectors rose, with consumers and the construction industry making the biggest gains. The top-line reading rose to 89.2, from 87.8 in December (I don't have regional breakdowns, though). Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has told MPs in Madrid that he will soon announce fresh measures to stimulate the deteriorating Spanish economy. Reuters has the details: Rajoy told Spain's parliament that the measures would include help to entrepreneurs. Tax breaks for young entrepreneurs are among a series of measures Spain's government could announce in February, Reuters reported earlier this week. Rajoy's government has vowed, however, to stick to plans for budget cuts as it tries to slash a gaping deficit. As mentioned yesterday, Olli Rehn has hinted that Spain's fiscal targets for 2013 (to cut its deficit to 4.5% of GDP) could be relaxed. That could give Rajoy the wriggle room needed for a stimulus package... Analysts at UBS fear that Spanish GDP will keep falling through 2013: The deepening Spanish recession hasn't hit optimism in Europe's financial markets. The euro has hit $1.35 against the US dollar for the first time since December 2011. with traders seemingly happy to ignore the poor data coming out of Madrid: This graph shows how Spain's economy struggled out of recession in 2010, only to slide back last year: You can read the official announcement that Spain's GDP fell by 0.7% in the last three months here, on the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica website. It explained: This result was basically caused by a more negative contribution in the domestic demand, which was compensated partially by a positive contribution of the external demand. This morning's poor GDP data comes just a day after we learned that Spanish retail sales had tumbled by over 10% in December (details here). As my colleague Giles Tremlett wrote from Madrid: With sales tax hikes biting, unemployment growing and many workers and pensioners watching the real values of their income fall, Spaniards kept their wallets tightly closed, helping to produce a 10.7% fall in sales in December compared with the same month in 2011. And last week we learned that Spanish youth unemployment was now 60%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news across the eurozone and beyond, and other key developments. Just in: the Spanish recession has deepened in the last three months, and by more than economists or Spain's own central bank had expected. Data just released showed that Spanish GDP fell by 0.7% in the last three months of 2012. We were expecting a 0.6% decline in economic output. That means the country's economy was 1.8% smaller than a year ago in the last quarter, as the country's austerity package and the wider eurozone crisis hits output and consumer demand. This follows a 0.3% contraction in the third quarter of 2012, and a 0.4% drop in the second quarter. More to follow....",

      "bodyText": "If western countries want a positive GDP growth rate in the current climate the government needs to be a buyer not a seller. The 0.1% contraction in US GDP in the fourth quarter, is not only the result of a cut in government spending; the decision to restrict defence budget has played a big part. Since 2009 Washington has kept pumping the subsidies and welfare support, offsetting the effects of intense cuts in spending at local and state level. The effect has been to keep the GDP number positive. In the last three months of 2012 that situation changed, as federal government cuts kicked in. Overall, government spending fell at a rate of 15% after a 9.5% increase in the previous quarter, knocking 1.33 percentage points from growth. The figures show departments blocked purchases, none more so than defence, which had a spending tumble of 22.2%. To give some context to this dramatic number, the decline in defence spending was the largest since 1972. Still, there is no reason to think the US is going to follow the UK and the rest of Europe into recession. There were one-off factors, such as Hurricane Sandy, which affected New York and much of the north-eastern seaboard. Importantly, c onsumer and business spending continued their upwards path and disposable incomes increased substantially in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose 2.2%, up from 1.6% in the previous quarter. Business investment rebounded from a surprise drop in the third quarter. The housing market made further gains following a 15.3% increase in residential construction, up from 13.5% in the July to October quarter. Reuters pointed out that home building added to growth last year for the first time since 2005. Chris Williamson, chief economist at data provider Markit, said most of the negative figures related to a trough in October and have been reversed. It is a view upheld by the way the US calculates GDP growth \u2013 which is to take a 0.025% decline between October and December and multiply it by four to get the annualised figure of -0.1%. With housing and manufacturing turning a corner, there have been plenty of commentators pondering the fate of US central bank policy and whether correctBen Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, will raise interest rates sooner than expected. This GDP figure, and lacklustre jobs figures later this week, should dampen those thoughts. Without the reduction in stock spending, the economy grew at 1.1%. But the main worry is that US exports fell for the first time since the first quarter of 2009. Exports have been hit by the recession in Europe, a slowing Chinese economy, and disruptions at US ports caused by Sandy and strikes. Trade is key to growth and the decline shaved a quarter of a percentage point from GDP growth. Williamson says that even the trade picture is brighter. Nevertheless, when your chief export destinations are also pursuing austerity, what can a nation expect but declining sales? The same goes for the UK and the other 26 EU members. If everyone chases austerity they don't dig themselves out of a hole \u2013 they just dig a bigger hole.",

Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> It's feels like it's been such a long time since we've seen a sell off in equities that it comes as rather a surprise, and we've almost forgotten what it looks like to see red across our screens. But today there's a clear cut reason for the decline as the first reading of fourth quarter US GDP showed the world's biggest economy has slipped back into contraction, just as the UK figure did last week. <br> This came as a bit of a bombshell for investors who hadn't been anywhere near expecting such a sharp move to the downside, but it indicates just how nervous businesses were throughout the fiscal cliff negotiations that went down to the wire. However, the decline was not as aggressive as it might have been in normal circumstances: investors know that the fiscal cliff debacle at the end of last year would have only led to a temporary freeze in production, so expectations are for the growth figure to bounce back in the first quarter of this year rather than this being the start of another structural decline for the US economy. Even if it is something more structural there's always the prospect of further central bank assistance and tonight sees the US Federal Reserve rate announcement that could have a very dovish tone to it following today's data. </blockquote> <p>Defence companies were hit by a decline in US spending as shown by the GDP figures, with <strong>BAE Systems</strong> down 7.3p at 341p and <strong>Chemring</strong> closing 14.1p lower at 275.8p.</p> <p>On the whole, recent trading statements have shown companies performing reasonably well, so a spate of more negative updates also dented investor enthusiasm.</p> <p><strong>Antofagasta</strong> was a good example. It was the biggest faller in the leading index, 106p lower at \u00a311.69 after it said production costs would rise in 2013 and it would not increase output.</p> <p><strong>Polymetal</strong> - lifted in recent days by talk of a possible merger with Polyus Gold - lost 22p to \u00a310.88 as it warned there was a chance it could miss its production target of 1.2m troy ounces of gold in 2013 due to delays at a Russian plant.</p> <p>Platinum refiner <strong>Johnson Matthey</strong> dropped 102p to \u00a323.06 as third quarter profits fell 19% to \u00a384.3m, hit by lower sales of catalytic converters for car exhaust systems in Europe and weak demand in Japan.</p> <p>Elsewhere the growing black market trade in cigarettes is hitting profits at <strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong>, the company admitted.</p> <p>It said it expected first half operating profits to be down on the same period last year due to illicit trade in Europe, and increased investment in key markets.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares fell back after five days of rises, following poor US economic news and a number of disappointing trading updates. A surprise drop in US GDP helped push the FTSE 100 down 16.08 points to 6323.11 after earlier signs that a new five year peak was on the cards. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said: It's feels like it's been such a long time since we've seen a sell off in equities that it comes as rather a surprise, and we've almost forgotten what it looks like to see red across our screens. But today there's a clear cut reason for the decline as the first reading of fourth quarter US GDP showed the world's biggest economy has slipped back into contraction, just as the UK figure did last week. This came as a bit of a bombshell for investors who hadn't been anywhere near expecting such a sharp move to the downside, but it indicates just how nervous businesses were throughout the fiscal cliff negotiations that went down to the wire. However, the decline was not as aggressive as it might have been in normal circumstances: investors know that the fiscal cliff debacle at the end of last year would have only led to a temporary freeze in production, so expectations are for the growth figure to bounce back in the first quarter of this year rather than this being the start of another structural decline for the US economy. Even if it is something more structural there's always the prospect of further central bank assistance and tonight sees the US Federal Reserve rate announcement that could have a very dovish tone to it following today's data. Defence companies were hit by a decline in US spending as shown by the GDP figures, with BAE Systems down 7.3p at 341p and Chemring closing 14.1p lower at 275.8p. On the whole, recent trading statements have shown companies performing reasonably well, so a spate of more negative updates also dented investor enthusiasm. Antofagasta was a good example. It was the biggest faller in the leading index, 106p lower at \u00a311.69 after it said production costs would rise in 2013 and it would not increase output. Polymetal - lifted in recent days by talk of a possible merger with Polyus Gold - lost 22p to \u00a310.88 as it warned there was a chance it could miss its production target of 1.2m troy ounces of gold in 2013 due to delays at a Russian plant. Platinum refiner Johnson Matthey dropped 102p to \u00a323.06 as third quarter profits fell 19% to \u00a384.3m, hit by lower sales of catalytic converters for car exhaust systems in Europe and weak demand in Japan. Elsewhere the growing black market trade in cigarettes is hitting profits at Imperial Tobacco, the company admitted. It said it expected first half operating profits to be down on the same period last year due to illicit trade in Europe, and increased investment in key markets. The company saw weakness in the EU - where the legal cigarette market is currently 7% lower - and in Russia, but better performances in emerging markets. Imperial closed 105p lower at \u00a323.61. Meanwhile Petrofac, the energy services group, was hit by a surprise warning from Italian peer Saipem. Saipem, Europe's biggest oil services group which is controlled by ENI, said late on Tuesday that profits would be 6% lower than expected. Its new management blamed falling margins on new contracts and a tough business environment. The news pushed Petrofac down 122p to \u00a316.15. In the same sector, Amec lost 23p to \u00a310.76, while Wood Group dropped 18p to 805.5p. Goldman Sachs said: In our view, there is some read-across [from the Saipem warning] to other offshore and onshore engineering and construction companies in the sector as the weaker outlook at least in part reflects a competitive bidding environment during a period of strong backlog build for many companies. Among the mid-caps, engineering group Renishaw ended down 100p at \u00a318.60. The company said first half profits had risen 48% but second half revenue would be flat compared to the same period last year. Heading the other way was Phoenix - the insurance group chaired by former FSA boss Howard Davies - after it announced a fundraising and the repayment of \u00a3450m of debt. It will raise \u00a3250m by issuing new shares at 500p each, and also plans a 27% increase in the final dividend. Phoenix rose 39p to 630p. Elsewhere optimism about its new processors helped lift chip designer Arm. The company's chief executive Warren East said the first of its new energy-efficient 64-bit processors were due to come to market next year and had already attracted strong interest, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. This pushed Arm up 4p to 873.5p despite Numis cutting its recommendation from buy to hold. Meanwhile Imagination Technologies jumped 56.4p to 497.9p - a near 13% increase - after Morgan Stanley moved from equal weight to overweight and set a 570p price target on the chip designer, up from 450p. The bank said: We believe two key potential catalysts are not fully priced in: 1) access to China via partner MediaTek presents a play on low-end emerging market smartphone growth; 2) potential design win in the Samsung Galaxy S4 could drive upside. Advertising giant WPP added 12.5p to 990p after Jefferies raised its recommendation from hold to buy and its target price from 800p to \u00a311.50. The bank said: An analysis of WPP's largest clients and their 2013 ad budgets looks encouraging and with expectations low, we see upside risk.

Angus Campbell at Capital Spreads said: The rally for risk assets continues and investors seem to almost be positioning themselves for a situation now where if things on the global economic front really do improve, then we could see even further strength to the upside. The worse than expected US consumer confidence data yesterday would hardly back this up considering how poor it was, however any bad data could also be taken as a cue for investors to remain bullish of risk assets because central banks will have to continue their ultra easy monetary policy. Either way, for many investors it seems like a win-win scenario right now. Marketing and advertising giant WPP has risen to the top of the pile, up 22.5p to \u00a310 after Jefferies raised its recommendation from hold to buy and its target price from 800p to \u00a311.50. The bank said: An analysis of WPP's largest clients and their 2013 ad budgets looks encouraging and with expectations low, we see upside risk. Additionally, we see cash returns rather than acquisitions increasingly the focus for 2013 following 2012's transformational M&amp;A. The shift to a lower risk, bolt-on strategy frees up cash for higher dividends and lowers integration risks. We see the risk-reward attractively balanced and upgrade to buy.",

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable has written to the seven companies in the FTSE 100 that continue to have all-male boards to demand details on what action they are taking to appoint female directors. The business secretary outlined \"the real business benefits\" of diversity in the boardroom in letters to the boards of Antofagasta, Croda, Glencore, Xstrata, Kazakhmys, Melrose and Vedanta. The seven companies with men-only boardrooms are largely in the mining and natural resources sector and Cable acknowledged that such sectors \"can face particular challenges in appointing women for a variety of reasons\". Frequent travel and project-based work in remote areas of the world have been cited as barriers to appointing more women in the past. \"However, I would be grateful to know what steps your company is taking to overcome these barriers and increase the number of women on your board,\" said Cable, right. The number of all-male boards in the blue chip index has fallen from 21 since 2010 when Lord Davies, former banker and trade minister, set out voluntary targets for 25% female representation in boardrooms by 2015. Randgold Resources is the latest to capitulate after naming Jeanine Mabunda Lioko, a former banker and politician in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to its board as a non-executive director this week. Cable said action by UK companies would help resistance to calls from Europe for mandatory quotas. \"You are also aware, I am sure, of the interest being shown in this issue at an EU level, with the European commission proposing legislation that would require all quoted companies to put in place transparent appointment processes to secure 40% female non-executives by 2020,\" he wrote. \"I do not believe that EU legislation would help us achieve greater boardroom diversity, but it will be harder for us to make that case without progress here in the UK.\" He made his pledge to write to companies with men-only boards in November when data showed there had been little progress in increasing the number of female executive directors from 7% of all executive directorships. Cable said: \"My vision by 2015 is that Britain will not have a single FTSE 100 board without a significant female presence.\" Discussions have taken place about whether there should be targets for FTSE 250 companies but some campaigners are concerned about the lack of women coming up through organisations to hold executive roles. A survey by the Guardian found that women account for only 14% of all the positions on executive committees, regarded as a stepping stone to the boardroom.",
