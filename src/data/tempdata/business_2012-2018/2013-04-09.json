New cash-counting machines are being installed in stores, meaning that 689 cash office managers and supervisors would no longer be needed, the company said. It added: \"The introduction of new technology is an ongoing programme to ensure that Morrisons continues to improve its competitiveness.\" The decision comes six months after 165 jobs were scrapped at the company's Bradford headquarters when its financial transaction processing service was outsourced to an Indian firm. A four-week consultation has started with staff; however, it is understood that they are unlikely to be redeployed to other jobs. The last major round of redundancies by the company was in 2006, when about 2,000 workers were axed as a result of the closure of three depots, in Kent, Bristol and Warrington. Morrisons has been struggling recently, despite coming through the horsemeat scandal unscathed, thanks to its integrated supply chain. The lack of an online groceries operation and its limited number of convenience stores \u2013 the two biggest growth areas in food sales \u2013 mean the company is lagging behind competitors. The most recent data by analysts at Kantar Worldpanel revealed Morrisons' market share fell to 11.7% in March, compared with 12.3% at the same time a year earlier; it was the only major supermarket to suffer a fall. At its annual results last month, the company reported its first decline in profits for six years \u2013 a 7% fall in pretax profits to \u00a3879m on sales of \u00a318.1bn. Like-for-like sales were down 2.1% and 400,000 shoppers went elsewhere. Morrisons is the only big four supermarket yet to launch a groceries website. However, chief executive Dalton Philips said one would start in early 2014 and it was revealed bosses had been in discussions with Ocado. The market is worth \u00a35.6bn a year and is expected to double within a decade, with rivals at Asda, Sainsbury's and market leader Tesco all reporting double-digit growth in online sales. Another double-digit growth area which Morrisons has failed to capitalise in is convenience stores, which has been dominated by Tesco and Sainsbury's. Philips said he wants to focus attention on opening about 100 new M Local branches, mainly in London and the south east, where the business is least exposed.

      "bodyText": "Sir James Crosby, the former boss of HBOS, has asked for his knighthood to be revoked after a scathing report by MPs found that he sowed the \"seeds of destruction\" at one of Britain's biggest banks. Crosby was chief executive of HBOS until 2006, but was described as the architect of a strategy that just two years later led to the bank having to be rescued by Lloyds and eventually bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayers' money. He said he was \"deeply sorry\" for his role in HBOS's failure and asked for his knighthood to be removed. He is believed to be the first person to have voluntarily offered to hand back a knighthood. The 57-year-old chose to give up the honour, granted in 2006, rather than face the prospect of being stripped of it \u2013 as Fred Goodwin, the former boss of RBS was last year. Crosby also offered to hand back 30% of his \u00a3580,000-a-year pension. He will still collect \u00a3406,000 annually in pension payments \u2013 80 times as much as the average private sector worker. On Tuesday he also quit his \u00a3125,000-a-year role on the board of catering company Compass. Attention is now likely to turn to his successor at HBOS, Andy Hornby, and the chairman, crossbench peer Lord Stevenson, who were also blamed in the damning report. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said: \"James Crosby has done the right thing. Clearly it's not sustainable for Andy Hornby not to follow.\" Crosby's decision came hours after David Cameron refused to intervene when MPs from all three main political parties called for action. The former banker, who is sitting on a pension pot worth more than \u00a320m, said he had \"never sought to dissociate\" himself from HBOS's near-failure and its bailout by taxpayers. \"Shortly after I left HBOS, I received the enormous honour of a knighthood in recognition of my own \u2013 and many other people's \u2013contribution to the creation of a company which was then widely regarded as a great success,\" he said. \"In view of what has happened subsequently to HBOS, I believe that it is right that I should now ask the appropriate authorities to take the necessary steps for its removal.\" The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards report, published on Friday, had described him as the \"architect of the strategy that set the course for disaster\". The MPs blamed Crosby for putting in place \"a culture of perilously high\u2013risk lending\" with a lack of controls that \"may have given rise to an accident waiting to happen\". Crosby said the report, which described his misjudgments as \"toxic\", made for \"very chastening reading\". The honours forfeiture committee, chaired by the head of the civil service Sir Bob Kerslake, will meet to discuss Crosby's request for his knighthood to be revoked. A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said although it is believed to be the first time anyone has asked to have their knighthood revoked, Crosby's request does not preclude the committee formally stripping him of the title if it is told to consider doing so \u2013 as happened with Goodwin. Paul Moore, the HBOS whistleblower fired by Crosby in 2004 for warning that the bank's growth was \"a serious risk to financial stability and consumer protection\", welcomed his former boss's decision but said Crosby should \"specify what he did wrong\" and \"be an example to everyone\". He also called on Hornby and Stevenson to \"examine their consciences\" as \"32,000 people lost their jobs as a result of the merger between HBOS and Lloyds. That's a lot of people\". Pat McFadden MP, a member of the banking commission, said it was \"some belated recognition on Sir James Crosby's part of his leading role in a very irresponsible and ultimately calamitous strategy for this bank\".

Mann also welcomed Crosby's decision to forgo some of his pension, but pointed out that \"he's still hardly going to go starving\". Crosby said the 30% of his pension he was waiving \u2013 worth \u00a3174,000 a year \u2013 would go to \"good causes, or benefit shareholders, with the pension scheme's employer and trustees\". Crosby sold two-thirds of his HBOS shares after leaving the bank but before its near collapse. It is not known exactly how much money he made from cashing in the shares. He earned nearly \u00a38m while chief executive of the bank, which he helped create with the merger of Halifax and Bank of Scotland. Crosby will also stand down from his role as a trustee of Cancer Research UK. On Friday, he resigned from his role as an adviser to private equity firm Bridgepoint Capital. The parliamentary report called for Crosby, Hornby and Stevenson to be banned from working in banking after their \"self-delusion\" led the bank to require a \u00a328bn rescue from the government and Lloyds Banking Group. Hornby, who took over as CEO of HBOS in 2006 and is now chief executive of betting firm Coral, received a pension pot worth \u00a3240,000 when he resigned in 2009.",

He swapped his knighthood, which was a Commonwealth award, for a 110-year prison sentence. Elsewhere from the world of business, Jack Lyons, convicted for his role in the Guinness share-trading scandal, was stripped of his knighthood in 1991.",

    "webTitle": "Eurozone crisis: Slovenia rejects bailout talk as Soros urges Germany to accept eurobonds - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That's all for today, folks. Here's a closing summary: \u2022 Slovenia's prime minister has denied that she will be forced to seek a bailout. Alenka Bratusek said that fixing the Slovenian banking sector was her government's top priority, and could be achieved without international help. She was supported by EC president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, who was adamant that Slovenia should not be compared to Cyprus. (see 2.58pm onwards for highlights of their press conference) \u2022 But the OECD has warned that Slovenia is on the brink of a serious banking crisis. It wants Bratusek to push on with recapitalising struggling banks and makes wide-ranging reforms (see 12.09pm for details and the report itself). \u2022 Slovenia also accepted higher borrowing costs at an bond auction today (results here) \u2022 George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, has given a speech in Frankfurt arguing that Germany should drop its opposition to eurobonds. If it cannot accept collective debt, it should leave the euro, he argued (see 5.25pm). \u2022 In Cyprus, officials warns that time is running out to get its bailout finalised (see here) \u2022 On the economic front... German exports and imports both fell in February (see here), and Britain's trade gap widened again.... (see here). Let's do it all again tomorrow. Goodnight! Interesting piece by Jeremy Warner of the Daily Telegraph tonight: he's suggesting that Angela Merkel could actually make a dramatic conversion in favour of collective debt if she wins this autumn's general election. The column doesn't actually appear to be linked to Soros's speech tonight (see 5.25pm), as it happens. But it's timely, and a good read - arguing that the German chancellor must consider the issue: Let's just briefly consider what will in fact have to happen if Merkel is to save the euro and secure her position in history. The present approach amounts to just prancing around in front of the goal posts and won't anywhere near hack it. The euro can never become a proper currency with a long term future unless it moves fairly rapidly towards A/ a fully fledged banking union, with common deposit insurance and resolution regimes, and B/ at least a degree of debt mutualisation, or fiscal union. Warner also explains how it's possible to get some degree of shared debt without requiring a new EU treaty or being red-carded by the German constitutional court; although full-blown mutualisation would need major changes. More here: It's not a question of if, but only when Merkel grasps the nettle of eurozone debt mutualisation. Over in Cyprus tonight, there is concern that the country is running of time, and money, to actually receive the first slice of its aid package. My colleague Helena Smith reports that officials have said it is imperative a controversial \u20ac10bn bailout is approved by EU parliaments and sealed with international lenders by 24 April. If an agreement fails to be reached by then \u2013 and bailout funds are not there to replenish dried up coffers \u2013 President Nicos Anastasiades' administration will face the daunting prospect of being unable to pay state salaries and pensions. The full story is here: Clock ticking on Cyprus deal George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, is giving a speech in Frankfurt now in which he is arguing that Germany must decide whether to embrace eurobonds or whether to leave the eurozone. Soros's solution for Europe's debt crisis is collective debt backed by the whole of the eurozone not just individual countries. He's made the argument before, but this time his pitch is that the German people have never been given the option of choosing. We have the full transcript of the speech here: George Soros: how to save the EU from the euro crisis - the speech in full So I won't attempt to summarise it.But here's the key paragraphs on eurobonds - which Soros admits are an unpopular idea in Germany today: People don't realize that agreeing to eurobonds would be much less costly than doing only the minimum to preserve the euro. That is how misconceptions can become engrained in public opinion. It is up to Germany to decide whether it is willing to authorise eurobonds or not. But it has no right to prevent the heavily indebted countries from escaping their misery by banding together and issuing eurobonds. In other words, if Germany is opposed to eurobonds it should consider leaving the euro and letting the others introduce them. This exercise would yield a surprising result: eurobonds issued by a eurozone that excludes Germany would still compare favorably with those of the US, UK and Japan. The net debt of these three countries as a proportion of their GDP is actually higher than that of the eurozone excluding Germany. And this section, from earlier in the speech explaining why the centre of the eurozone needs to take new steps to ease the crisis: The burden of responsibility falls mainly on Germany. The Bundesbank helped design the blueprint for the euro whose defects put Germany into the driver's seat. This has created two problems. One is political, the other financial. It is the combination of the two that has rendered the situation so intractable. The political problem is that Germany did not seek the dominant position into which it has been thrust and it is unwilling to accept the obligations and liabilities that go with it. Germany understandably doesn't want to be the \"deep pocket\" for the euro. So it extends just enough support to avoid default but nothing more, and as soon as the pressure from the financial markets abates it seeks to tighten the conditions on which the support is given. The financial problem is that Germany is imposing the wrong policies on the eurozone. Austerity doesn't work. You cannot shrink the debt burden by shrinking the budget deficit. The debt burden is a ratio between the accumulated debt and the GDP, both expressed in nominal terms. And in conditions of inadequate demand, budget cuts cause a more than proportionate reduction in the GDP \u2014 in technical terms the so-called fiscal multiplier is greater than one. The German public finds this difficult to understand. The fiscal and structural reforms undertaken by the Schroeder government worked in 2006; why shouldn't they work for the eurozone a few years later? The answer is that austerity works by increasing exports and reducing imports. When everybody is doing the same thing it simply doesn't work. Back in the eurozone crisis: here's a couple of stories about this afternoon's meeting between Slovenia prime minister Alenka Bratusek and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso. Dow Jones: Slovenia PM Says Country Does Not Need Bailout Europolitics: No bailout needed - Slovenian PM Here's our story on James Crosby's decision to hand back his knighthood: James Crosby to give up knighthood and 30% of pension Big news in the UK - Sir James Crosby, the former chief executive of HBOS, has asked the UK authorities to take back his knighthood. He has also asked to surrender 30% of his pension. This follows the official report into the collapse of HBOS in 2008, which was published last week, and was extremely critical of the bankers who ran the bank. Here's the full statement: A personal statement from James Crosby Friday's report from The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards made for very chastening reading. Although I stood down as CEO of HBOS in 2006, some 3 years before it was taken over by Lloyds, I have never sought to disassociate myself from what has happened. I would therefore like to repeat today what I said when I appeared in public before the Commission in December; namely that I am deeply sorry for what happened at HBOS and the ensuing consequences for former colleagues, shareholders, taxpayers and society in general. Shortly after I left HBOS, I received the enormous honour of a Knighthood in recognition of my own - and many other people's - contribution to the creation of a company which was then widely regarded as a great success. In view of what has happened subsequently to HBOS, I believe that it is right that I should now ask the appropriate authorities to take the necessary steps for its removal. During the course of my 30 year career, including 12 years at Halifax and HBOS, I both contributed to and built up a substantial pension entitlement. This pension entitlement is entirely contractual in nature. However I have decided to forego 30% of my gross pension entitlement payable to me during the rest of my lifetime*. I will be discussing how this reduction is implemented, and whether the amount waived should go to support good causes, or benefit shareholders, with the pension scheme's employer and trustees. It is with great personal sadness that I have decided to stand down from my voluntary position as a Trustee of Cancer Research UK. They do remarkable work and it has been a great privilege and pleasure to have played my part. However I want to put their interests firmly before mine and would wish them every success in the future. Throughout my business career I have always tried to act with integrity and to the best of my abilities. I have had the enormous privilege of working with people and organisations about whom I cared deeply. I would like to express my sincere regret for events and my appreciation for the personal support I have been shown. [end] * The current annual pension payment amounts to c\u00a3580,000 per annum. Slovenia's PM also argued that the creation of a bad bank this summer would help address its problems. Alenka Bratusak said she was aware that Slovenia's banking problems needed to be fixed (as the OECD identified today - see 9.04am) Bratusek also warned, though, that balancing the country's budget may take longer than previously hoped. Reuters has the quotes: It is too optimistic to expect Slovenia to reach a balanced budget by 2015, the country's prime minister said on Tuesday. \"I personally have a problem with the fact that the date 2015 is mentioned in the constitution for the final consolidation of Slovenian public finances,\" Alenka Bratusek told journalists after meeting the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso. \"I think this is too optimistic regarding the current economic situation and the current level of the deficit. But the consolidation of public finances is certainly one of our three priorities.\" She also said that fresh capital for the country's banks would be one of her government's first steps. And as flagged up at 3.14pm, Bratusek insisted that a bailout is not needed. European Commission president Barroso has firmly rejected any suggestion that Slovenia might see a repeat of the Cypriot bailout, in which large depositors were 'bailed in' to the rescue package. Asked by the FT's Peter Spiegel if he had a message for savers in Slovenia, Barroso replied that he would \"not engage\" in any comparison with Cyprus. It is a completely different situation in Cyprus and in Slovenia. Barroso adding that it would be \"abusive\" to make a comparison between the two countries (Cyprus's banking sector being so much larger, as a percentage of its national GDP, than Slovenia's). Barroso also told the press conference that there was \"no indication\" that Slovenia would require an aid package. There's plenty of interest in the issue though -- apparently Slovenia is getting more attention from the Brussels press pack than usual: Slovenian PM Alenka Bratusek has insisted that her country is \"strong and stable\", and urged people to look at the \"facts\": Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso told journalists at the press conference in Brussels that Slovenia faces a 'very demanding task' on reforms, but said he was confident it would achieve it. He explained that Prime minister Bratusek had told him Slovenia has a \"very strong commitment\" to making the necessary reforms so that a bailout is not needed. Barroso added that Brussels wants to see details of Slovenia's future reform plans, for its banking sector and the wider economy. I'm confident that those reforms will be adequate...to pave the way to an economic recovery. Alenka Bratusek, the prime minister of Slovenia, is giving a joint press conference with Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission now. It's being streamed here. Highlights to follow.... The International Monetary Fund is discussing the analytical data behind its World Economic Outlook at a press conference now - it's online here. Update: John Simon, senior economist at the IMF, told this afternoon's press conference that we're not likely to see a repeat of the inflationary 1970s. He cited three factors; central banks are more 'credible' than in the '70s, public inflation expectations are lower, and there's a flatter Philips curve today (a measure of how prices rise in relation to falling unemployment) Slovenia saw its borrowing costs rise, and sold less debt than hoped, at a bond auction today. The OECD's warning over its banking sector, and speculation that it may require a bailout, may be hitting investor confidence. Slovenia sold a total of \u20ac56m of debt, compared to a maximum total of \u20ac100m (it received offers for around \u20ac80m, but decided not to take the most expensive bids). The yield on \u20ac32.3m of six-month bills rose to 1.7%, from 1.5% in an auction in March. The yield on \u20ac23.8m of 12-month bills rose to 2.99%, up from 2.02% in February. In Cyprus, a parliamentary probe into allegations that some wealthy depositors managed to whisk their money out of the country before accounts were frozen last month has been suspended. MPs blasted the country's central bank, saying it had only supplied half a month of transactional data, not the year's worth it had asked for. Reuters explains that deputy central bank governor Spyros Stavrinakis sent the MPs the limited amount of data in a list. The head of the Cypriot parliament's ethics committee, which was due to look into a list detailing transfers of more than \u20ac100,000 from the two major banks - Bank of Cyprus and Cyprus Popular Bank - said on Tuesday that the list fell short of what he had requested. \"It was with great disappointment and anger that, when we opened the envelope, we realised it contained data for only 15 days even though we had asked for a year,\" lawmaker Demetris Syllouris told reporters. \"This kind of behaviour is unacceptable.\" In a letter to Syllouris, then central bank deputy governor Stavrinakis said he was only attaching a list of individuals and companies who transferred money out of Cyprus between March 1-15 this year. \"We believe your request would lead to a huge volume of information, which would possibly not help the aim of your committee,\" Stavrinakis said. This included foreign companies that transfer large sums of money each day, as well as Cypriots who bought property, he said. Stavrinakis had been appointed by the previous government earlier this year. In another twist today, that appointment was reversed by the current administration. Slovenia is already going through an austerity programme - or a \"front-loaded and mainly expenditure-driven consolidation\", as the OECD style guide puts it. Here's the details: The generosity of social transfers was reduced. Subsidies for school and student meals were lowered, parents were required to cover 30% of childcare costs for the second child, the parental benefit for child care and nursing was cut, the indexation of child benefits was frozen and eligibility conditions were tightened for higher- income earners. However, cuts in nominal public sector wages were 5%, somewhat less than what had been announced initially due to earlier commitments to increase wages. Measures on the revenue side include, among others, a new tax on immovable property, a new higher marginal personal income tax, and increased taxes on motor vehicles. Further cuts to wages, pensions and unemployment benefit are already 'pencilled in' for the next two years, the OECD adds (see page 17 of today's report for more). The OECD's report into Slovenia (pdf) paints a gloomy picture of a country badly hit by the financial crisis, and heading deeper into trouble. The country's economy, for example, is enduring a double-dip recession, which has driven unemployment over 10% at a 14-year high: This economic decline has driven up the amount of bad loans on the country's banks (The OECD criticises Slovenia's banks for being rather too lax about risk during the good times): Slovenian banks are ranked fourth on this chart for bad debts, behind Greece, Ireland and Hungary (interesting to see Italy in 5th place too) Around 14% of loans on Slovenia's bank balance sheets are classed as 'non-performing' (as in at least 90 days in arrears). That is likely to get worse, the OECD says: As the recession drags on, this is likely to deteriorate further. The situation is particularly worrying in the non-financial corporate sector, where non-performing loans (NPLs) reached 24% of the portfolio. Construction companies are responsible for a large share, as 62% of their loans are overdue for more than 90 days and the largest companies are insolvent. The quality of the loan portfolio has deteriorated the most for large state-controlled banks, whose NPLs to private firms amount to 30% of their total loans to these firms in October 2012 (Figure 3, Panel B). In comparison, foreign banks in Slovenia have a NPL ratio of only 11% of their lending to private firms, suggesting that an increase in bad loans of state-controlled banks reflects not just the business cycle but also deeper governance problems. The OECD has uploaded its report on Slovenia - you can see it here: Economic Survey of Slovenia 2013. Here's the top line: Slovenia has been hit hard by a boom-bust cycle, compounded by reform backlogs and the euro area sovereign debt crisis. The reduction of public and private sector indebtedness is significantly weighing on growth amid tight financial conditions, growing unemployment and stalling export performance. Although important reforms have been adopted in 2012 and early 2013, additional and far-reaching reforms are needed as soon as possible to restore confidence and head off the risks of a prolonged downturn and constrained access to financial markets. And here are the key bulletpoints: \u2022 The economy is in a deep recession. \u2022 Slovenia is facing a severe banking crisis, \u2022 The authorities have adopted an ambitious fiscal consolidation path, but the fiscal position is not yet sustainable. \u2022 Restructuring welfare spending would help achieve fiscal sustainability. \u2022 Potential growth has fallen significantly since the outset of the crisis. There are some interesting graphics too --- which I\"ll upload now... Over in Spain, the economy minister Luis de Guindos has said that economic output, which has been in shrinking steadily since mid-2011 fell again in the first quarter, but hinted the worst was over. Martin Roberts reports from Madrid: De Guindos estimated the drop in gross domestic product at 0.5-0.6%, ahead of official figures due out later this month. \u201cWe are still in negative territory, but it should be recalled that the fourth quarter of 2012 \u2013 when GDP contracted by 0.8% -- was the worst of the second dip,\u201d he told a business conference, referring to Spain\u2019s second recession since the economy entered crisis in 2008. The government predicts the recession will bottom out later this year and the economy will grow again in 2014, but several economists are sceptical because demand is so weak. Rating\u2019s agency Moody\u2019s is also dubious over government forecasts it can trim its deficit to 4.5% of GDP this year, and in a note this morning predicted the gap would actually be 6% in 2013, down from 7% in 2012. That would be someway short of Madrid's target of 4.5%. Moody kept its 'negative' rating on Spain's bond rating, which at Baa3 is only one notch above junk. US Treasury secretary Jack Lew is continuing his trip to Europe, where he is pushing politicians and euro officials to adjust their austerity strategy and focus more on growth. Today he's in Berlin, where he held meetings with German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. They're now holding a joint press conference, where Lew explained that the US is banking on Europe to return to growth: As we continue to address many of our long-term challenges, our economy's strength remains sensitive to events beyond our shores. We have an immense stake in a prosperous Europe. Lew then nudged Germany to use its economic muscle to help its weaker neighbours, saying it would be \"helpful\" if countries with the ability to increase consumer demand did so. Looking for Sch\u00e4uble's comments now... The deputy secretary of the OECD has commented on Slovenia's financial situation, saying he sees no 'immediate need' for a financial rescue package. Yves Leterme made the statement as the OECD presented its new report on Slovenia (see 9.41am) Reuters has the details: Slovenia, which is struggling to avoid a bailout, is not in immediate need of an economic rescue, Yves Leterme, deputy secretary general for the OECD, said on Tuesday. \"The government of this country has been able to meet its financial needs without difficulties so far,\" Leterme said in Ljubljana while presenting a critical economic survey on the euro zone country. \"It was at a relatively high cost (but) as far as we are concerned, there is no reason to anticipate an immediate need for a bailout.\" Last month Slovenia had a successful debt auction of \u20ac110m of short-term debt, with yields falling. It said in January it hopes to raise up to \u20ac3bn this year. Britain's trade gap has widened, with exports falling and imports rising in February. The Goods balance (the gap in value between what is physically shipped in and out of the UK) rose to -\u00a39.416bn, from -\u00a38.16bn in January. UK exports fell by 2.8% in February, while imports inched up by 0.3%. Britain's traditional surplus in invisible items (ie services) meant the total trade gap was \u00a33.64n, up from almost \u00a32.5bn in January. Not a sign that the UK's 'march of the makers' is proceeding smoothly, as Philip Aldrick, the Daily Telegraph's economic's editor, pointed out: But in better news: industrial production jumped by 1.0% in February (smashing forecasts of a 0.4% rise) which analysts believe means the economy will have returned to growth this quarter. But with output still 2.2% lower than a year ago, it's not a great picture. James Knightly of ING commented: With the UK\u2019s largest oil and gas field coming back on-stream in March, likely leading to another positive gain in output, we are more optimistic that the UK can avoid its third technical recession in five years. The OECD's warning to Slovenia (see 9.04am) comes at an awkward time for the country, with speculation over a possible bailout swirling. As Reuters puts it this morning: Following last month's messy rescue of Cyprus, the country of 2 million perched on Italy's northeast border is facing intensifying market pressure while seeking funds to heal its state-owned financial sector. Slovenia's banks, downgraded by Fitch last Friday, are still largely in public hands too. One of the OECD's criticisms is that the Slovenian government hasn't yet agreed a list of public assets to be privatized or spun off. Bloomberg explains: \u201cLimited equity markets and the backlog in the privatization program are hindering foreign direct investment, whose increase would help smooth corporate deleveraging,\u201d the group of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries said in the report. \u201cAn agreement on a list of public assets to be privatized or managed by a new sovereign holding is still lacking.\u201d And here's Bloomberg's full story: Slovenia Faces \u2018Severe\u2019 Banking Crisis in Recession, OECD Says. The OECD has warned that Slovenia faces the risk of a \"severe banking crisis\" after calculating that the cost of rescuing its banks could be significantly higher than officially estimated. In a report just released, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suggested that the bad debts on the books of Slovenia's banks (mostly state owned) could top the official estimate of \u20ac7bn. Those under-performing loans have fuelled fears that Slovenia, already in recession, might require its own financial aid package. The OECD didn't pull its punches, saying: Slovenia is facing a severe banking crisis, driven by excessive risk-taking, weak corporate governance of state-owned banks and insufficiently effective supervision tools. ..and urged the government to recapitalize \u201cdistressed, viable banks\u201d quickly, ideally by issuing new shares to investors. The IMF estimated last month that the government in Ljubljana must inject around \u20ac1bn into its banks. Worryingly, the OECD fears that the methodology used to calculate the bad debts on the Slovenian banking sector was \"weak and non-transparent\", so can't be relied upon: Capital needs are uncertain and could in fact be significantly higher. And the OECD was also gloomy about Slovenia's economic prospects - it expects GDP to shrink by 2.1% this year. Against this difficult background and with a possible further deterioration in the international environment, Slovenia faces risks of a prolonged downturn and constrained access to financial markets. Which is all likely to increase talk that Slovenia will become the next eurozone nation to seek help. Reuters adds that the OECD also wants the Slovenian government to make a series of economic reforms: It recommended Ljubljana increase the powers of the competition office, gradually raise the pension age, wean wealthier citizens off family benefits, cut unemployment and other benefits and improve efficiency in education and healthcare. The report is being presented in Ljubljiana this morning, so we should have a response from the Slovenian government shortly. The latest industrial data from the Netherlands isn't too encouraging either, falling by 1.7% in February compared with a year ago: Here's a few things to watch out for today: \u2022 OECD report into Slovenia - 8.30am BST (details to follow!) \u2022 Netherlands industrial production data for February - 8.30am BST \u2022 UK industrial production data for February - 9.30am BST \u2022 IMF releases analytical chapters of World Economic Outlook - 2.30pm \u2022 George Soros gives a lecture in Frankfurt on Europe - 4.30pm BST Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the world economy. First up, some disappointing economic data from the eurozone's two largest economies, France and Germany. German exports and imports both fell unexpectedly in February, in a sign that the eurozone recession may have bitter harder last winter. Exports from Germany slid by 1.5% in February, while imports took a 3.8% tumble. It could just be a blip - or it might be more serious. Christian Schulz of Berenberg Bank sums it up (via Reuters): After quite a strong January, February went worse. China could have played a role: the new year celebrations fell into February, which temporarily weighed on exports there The situation for German exporters remains tense. The euro zone remains in recession. That should dampen demand for German products for some time. Business with the U.S. and China is going significantly better. But temporary weak phases there therefore carry more weight. In terms of the surprisingly strong fall in imports, one will have to see whether it is is a temporary effect caused by the long winter or whether the euro crisis is unsettling consumers. Alexander Koch of Unicredit is more optimistic, though, suggesting optimism in the global economy will help exports. We get UK and Netherlands industrial data later this morning too, which should help explain what's going on. The news from France isn't too encouraging either. The French adjusted trade balance widened to -\u20ac6.01bn in February, from -\u20ac5.65bn in January (imports and exports were both down). But the Bank of France remains hopeful that the country dodged recession -- sticking to its forecast that GDP rose by 0.1% this quarter. This splurge of economic data comes as Portugal wrestles to find the savings demanded by its international lenders. Government ministers should be meeting later today to discuss the latest planned cutbacks. I'll be tracking the latest developments in Portugal, as well as watching Cyprus, Greece and Slovenia -- seen by some as the latest eurozone country which might need more support....",

He's made the argument before, but this time his pitch is that the German people have never been given the option of choosing.</p> <p>We have the full transcript of the speech here:</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/apr/09/george-soros-save-eu-from-euro-crisis-speech\">George Soros: how to save the EU from the euro crisis - the speech in full</a></strong></p> <p>So I won't attempt to summarise it.But here's the key paragraphs on eurobonds - which Soros admits are an unpopular idea in Germany today:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People don't realize that agreeing to eurobonds would be much less costly than doing only the minimum to preserve the euro. That is how misconceptions can become engrained in public opinion.</p> <p>It is up to Germany to decide whether it is willing to authorise eurobonds or not. But it has no right to prevent the heavily indebted countries from escaping their misery by banding together and issuing eurobonds. In other words, if Germany is opposed to eurobonds it should consider leaving the euro and letting the others introduce them.</p> <p>&#xa0;This exercise would yield a surprising result: eurobonds issued by a eurozone that excludes Germany would still compare favorably with those of the US, UK and Japan. The net debt of these three countries as a proportion of their GDP is actually higher than that of the eurozone excluding Germany.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this section, from earlier in the speech explaining why the centre of the eurozone needs to take new steps to ease the crisis:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The burden of responsibility falls mainly on Germany. The Bundesbank helped design the blueprint for the euro whose defects put Germany into the driver's seat. This has created two problems. One is political, the other financial. It is the combination of the two that has rendered the situation so intractable.</p> <p>The political problem is that Germany did not seek the dominant position into which it has been thrust and it is unwilling to accept the obligations and liabilities that go with it. Germany understandably doesn't want to be the \"deep pocket\" for the euro. So it extends just enough support to avoid default but nothing more, and as soon as the pressure from the financial markets abates it seeks to tighten the conditions on which the support is given.</p> <p>The financial problem is that Germany is imposing the wrong policies on the eurozone. Austerity doesn't work. You cannot shrink the debt burden by shrinking the budget deficit. The debt burden is a ratio between the accumulated debt and the GDP, both expressed in nominal terms. And in conditions of inadequate demand, budget cuts cause a more than proportionate reduction in the GDP \u2014 in technical terms the so-called fiscal multiplier is greater than one.</p> <p>The German public finds this difficult to understand. The fiscal and structural reforms undertaken by the Schroeder government worked in 2006; why shouldn't they work for the eurozone a few years later? The answer is that austerity works by increasing exports and reducing imports. When everybody is doing the same thing it simply doesn't work.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-04-09T16:26:39.683Z\">at 5.26pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51643b00b5798271e58835a1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-09T16:04:41.322Z\">5.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Key event</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7146c542-27ea-40c3-b47e-22ae2d24d977\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/9/1365523118168/a96f8083-c2e6-4099-99c4-224f020a0cee-296x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Slovenia Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek (L) and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso (R) shake hands as they pose for the media prior to their meeting at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, 09 April 2013.\" width=\"296\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slovenia Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek (L) and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso (R) shake hands as they pose for the media prior to their meeting at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, 09 April 2013.

He has also asked to surrender 30% of his pension</strong>.</p> <p>This follows the official report into the collapse of HBOS in 2008, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/apr/04/bankers-brought-down-hbos\">which was published last week</a>, and was extremely critical of the bankers who ran the bank.</p> <p>Here's the full statement:</p> <h2>A personal statement from James Crosby</h2> <p>Friday's report from The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards made for very chastening reading. Although I stood down as CEO of HBOS in 2006, some 3 years before it was taken over by Lloyds, I have never sought to disassociate myself from what has happened.</p> <p>I would therefore like to repeat today what I said when I appeared in public before the Commission in December; namely that I am deeply sorry for what happened at HBOS and the ensuing consequences for former colleagues, shareholders, taxpayers and society in general.</p> <p>Shortly after I left HBOS, I received the enormous honour of a Knighthood in recognition of my own - and many other people's - contribution to the creation of a company which was then widely regarded as a great success. In view of what has happened subsequently to HBOS, I believe that it is right that I should now ask the appropriate authorities to take the necessary steps for its removal.</p> <p>During the course of my 30 year career, including 12 years at Halifax and HBOS, I both contributed to and built up a substantial pension entitlement. This pension entitlement is entirely contractual in nature. However I have decided to forego 30% of my gross pension<br>entitlement payable to me during the rest of my lifetime*. I will be discussing how this reduction is implemented, and whether the amount waived should go to support good causes, or benefit shareholders, with the pension scheme's employer and trustees.</p> <p>It is with great personal sadness that I have decided to stand down from my voluntary position as a Trustee of Cancer Research UK. They do remarkable work and it has been a great privilege and pleasure to have played my part. However I want to put their interests firmly before mine and would wish them every success in the future.</p> <p>Throughout my business career I have always tried to act with integrity and to the best of my abilities. I have had the enormous privilege of working with people and organisations about whom I cared deeply. I would like to express my sincere regret for events and my appreciation for the personal support I have been shown.</p> <p>[end]</p> <p><em>* The current annual pension payment amounts to c\u00a3580,000 per annum.</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-04-09T15:14:18.435Z\">at 4.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51642704b5798271e5883597\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-09T14:34:44.829Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Slovenia's PM also argued that the creation of a bad bank this summer would help address its problems.</p> <p><strong>Alenka Bratusak</strong> said she was aware that Slovenia's banking problems needed to be fixed (as the OECD identified today - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/apr/09/eurozone-crisis-german-exports-slovenia#block-5163c463b5796d4b2d63dbd4\">see 9.04am</a>)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/davcarretta/status/321626488820625409\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Slovenia PM Bratusek \"aware that the banking system is Number One problem.

      "bodyText": "The euro crisis has already transformed the European Union from a voluntary association of equal states into a creditor-debtor relationship from which there is no easy escape. The creditors stand to lose large sums should a member state exit the union, yet debtors are subjected to policies that deepen their depression, aggravate their debt burden and perpetuate their subordinate position. As a result, the crisis is now threatening to destroy the European Union. That would be a tragedy of historic proportions which can only be prevented with German leadership. The causes of the crisis are so complicated that they boggle the mind. They cannot be properly understood without realising the crucial role that mistakes and misconceptions have played in creating them.The fatal flaw of the euro is that by creating an independent central bank, member countries have become indebted in a currency that they don't control. The risk of default relegates some member countries to the status of third world countries that became over-indebted in a foreign currency. This feature of the euro was ignored both by the authorities and market participants until the Greek crisis and it is still not properly understood today. At first, both the authorities and market participants treated all government bonds as if they were riskless, creating a perverse incentive for banks to load up on the weaker bonds. When Greece revealed the extent of its deficit, financial markets discovered the risk of sovereign debt default and raised risk premiums not only on Greek bonds but on the bonds of all heavily indebted euro members with a vengeance. Since European banks were heavily loaded with exactly those bonds, this precipitated a twin sovereign debt and banking crisis. Subsequently the so-called periphery countries were treated as if they were solely responsible for their misfortunes and the structural defects of the euro remained uncorrected. Germany and the other creditor countries did the minimum necessary to preserve the euro but they continued to apply the treaties that proved to be flawed and imposed new rules that prolonged and aggravated the recession. The pain and suffering is almost entirely self-inflicted by the eurozone. It has the quality of a nightmare. The burden of responsibility falls mainly on Germany. The Bundesbank helped design the blueprint for the euro, whose defects put Germany into the driver's seat. This has created two problems. One is political, the other financial. It is the combination of the two that has rendered the situation so intractable. The political problem is that Germany did not seek the dominant position into which it has been thrust and it is unwilling to accept the obligations and liabilities that go with it. Germany understandably doesn't want to be the \"deep pocket\" for the euro. So it extends just enough support to avoid default but nothing more, and as soon as the pressure from the financial markets abates it seeks to tighten the conditions on which the support is given. The financial problem is that Germany is imposing the wrong policies on the eurozone. Austerity doesn't work. You cannot shrink the debt burden by shrinking the budget deficit. The debt burden is a ratio between the accumulated debt and the GDP, both expressed in nominal terms. And in conditions of inadequate demand, budget cuts cause a more than proportionate reduction in the GDP \u2013 in technical terms the so-called fiscal multiplier is greater than one. This means for every that for every million euro reduction in the budget deficit, the country's GDP falls by more than a million euros, leading to a rise in the ration of national debt to GDP. The German public finds this difficult to understand. The fiscal and structural reforms undertaken by the Schr\u00f6der government worked in 2006; why shouldn't they work for the eurozone a few years later? The answer is that austerity for a single country works by increasing its exports and reducing its imports. When everybody is doing the same thing it simply doesn't work: it is clearly impossible for all members of the eurozone to improve their balance of trade with one another. In the bailout of Cyprus, Germany went too far. In order to minimise the cost of the bailout it insisted on bailing in bank depositors. This was premature. If it had happened after a banking union had been established and the banks recapitalised, it might have been a healthy reform. But it came at a time when the banking system was retreating into national silos and remained very vulnerable. What happened in Cyprus undermined the business model of European banks, which relies heavily on deposits. Until now the authorities went out of their way to protect depositors. Cyprus has changed that. Attention is focused on the impact of the rescue on Cyprus but the impact on the banking system is far more important. Banks will have to pay risk premiums that will fall more heavily on weaker banks and the banks of weaker countries. The insidious link between the cost of sovereign debt and bank debt will be reinforced and a banking union that would re-establish a more level playing field will be more difficult to attain. Chancellor Merkel would have liked to put the euro crisis on ice at least until after the elections, but it is back in force. The German public may be unaware of this because Cyprus was a tremendous political victory for chancellor Merkel. No country will dare to challenge her will. Moreover, Germany itself remains relatively unaffected by the deepening depression that is enveloping the eurozone. I expect, however, that by the time of the elections Germany will also be in recession. That is because the monetary policy pursued by the eurozone is out of sync with the other major currencies. The others are engaged in quantitative easing. The Bank of Japan was the last holdout but it changed sides recently. A weaker yen coupled with the weakness in Europe is bound to affect Germany's exports. The solution for all these problems of the eurozone can be summed up in one word: eurobonds. If countries that abide by the fiscal compact were allowed to convert their entire stock of government debt into eurobonds, the positive impact would be little short of the miraculous. The danger of default would disappear and so would the risk premiums. The balance sheets of the banks would receive an immediate boost and so would the budgets of the heavily indebted countries. Italy, for instance, would save up to 4% of its GDP. Its budget would move into surplus and fiscal stimulus would replace austerity. Its economy would grow and its debt ratio would fall. Most of the seemingly intractable problems would vanish into thin air. It would be truly like waking from a nightmare. With some modification, the fiscal compact would provide adequate safeguards against the risks involved in a joint and several obligation. It would allow member countries to issue new eurobonds only to replace maturing ones, but nothing more; after five years the outstanding debt would be gradually reduced to 60% of GDP. Non-compliant countries would be penalised by restricting the amount of eurobonds they are allowed to issue, forcing them to borrow the balance in their own name and pay heavy risk premiums \u2013 a powerful inducement to adhere to the fiscal compact's terms. Eurobonds would not ruin Germany's credit rating. On the contrary, they would favorably compare with the bonds of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Eurobonds are not a panacea. First of all, the fiscal compact itself needs some modifications to ensure that the penalties are automatic, prompt and not too severe to be credible. Second, the boost derived from eurobonds may not be sufficient, necessitating additional stimulus but it would be a luxury to have such a problem. Third, the European Union also needs a banking union and eventually a political union. The Cyprus rescue made these needs more acute by calling into question the business model of European banks that relies heavily on large deposits. The main limitation of eurobonds is that they would not eliminate the divergences in competiveness. But Germany accepting eurobonds would totally change the political atmosphere and facilitate structural reforms. Unfortunately Germany is adamantly opposed to eurobonds. Since chancellor Merkel vetoed them, the arguments put forward here have not even been considered. People don't realise that agreeing to eurobonds would be much less costly than doing only the minimum to preserve the euro. It is up to Germany to decide whether it is willing to authorise eurobonds or not. But it has no right to prevent the heavily indebted countries from escaping their misery by banding together and issuing eurobonds. In other words, if Germany is opposed to eurobonds it should consider leaving the euro and letting the others introduce them. This exercise would yield a surprising result: eurobonds issued by a eurozone that excludes Germany and other like-minded countries would still compare favourably with those of the US, UK and Japan. Let me explain why. SSince all the accumulated debt is denominated in euros, it makes all the difference which country remains in charge of the euro. If Germany left, the euro would depreciate. The debtor countries would regain their competitiveness. Their debt would diminish in real terms and, if they issued eurobonds, the threat of default would disappear. Their debt would suddenly become sustainable. Most of the burden of adjustment would fall on the countries that left the euro. Their exports would become less competitive and they would encounter stiff competition from the euro area in their home markets. By contrast, if Italy left, its euro-denominated debt burden would become unsustainable and would have to be restructured. This would plunge the global financial system into a meltdown, which may well prove beyond the capacity of the monetary authorities to contain. The collapse of the euro would likely lead to the disorderly disintegration of the European Union and Europe would be left worse off than it had been when it embarked on the noble experiment of creating a European Union. So, if anyone must leave it should be Germany, not Italy. There is a strong case for Germany to make a definitive choice whether to accept eurobonds or to leave the euro. The trouble is that Germany has not been put to the choice, and it has another alternative at its disposal: it can continue along the current course, always doing the minimum to preserve the euro, but nothing more. That is not the best alternative even for Germany, except perhaps in the very near term. Nevertheless, that is chancellor Merkel's preferred choice, at least until after the elections. In sum, I contend that Europe would be infinitely better off if Germany made a definite choice between accepting eurobonds or leaving the euro. That holds true whether Germany chose eurobonds or exit; and it holds true not only for Europe but also for Germany, except perhaps in the very near term. Which of the two alternatives is better for Germany is less clear-cut. Only the German electorate is qualified to decide. If a referendum were called today the eurosceptics would win hands down. But more intensive consideration could change people's mind. They would discover that authorising eurobonds would actually benefit Germany and the cost of leaving the euro has been greatly understated. I have made some surprising assertions; notably how well eurobonds could work even without Germany. My pro-European friends simply cannot believe it. They can't imagine a euro without Germany. I think they are conflating the euro with the European Union. The two are not identical. The European Union is the goal and the euro is a means to an end. Therefore the euro ought not to be allowed to destroy the European Union. But I may be too rational in my analysis. The European Union is conflated with the euro not only in popular narratives but also in law. Consequently the European Union may not survive Germany leaving the euro. In that case the German public needs to be persuaded to abandon some of its most ingrained prejudices and misconceptions and accept eurobonds. I should like to emphasise how important the European Union is not only for Europe, but for the world. The EU was meant to be the embodiment of the principles of open society. That means that perfect knowledge is unattainable. Nobody is free of prejudices and misconceptions; nobody should be blamed for having made mistakes. The blame begins only when a mistake or misconception is identified but not corrected. That is when the principles on which the European Union was built are betrayed. It is in that spirit that Germany should agree to eurobonds and save the European Union. \u2022 George Soros is chairman of Soros Fund Management and of the Open Society Foundations.

Although I stood down as CEO of HBOS in 2006, some three years before it was taken over by Lloyds, I have never sought to disassociate myself from what has happened.  I would therefore like to repeat today what I said when I appeared in public before the Commission in December; namely that I am deeply sorry for what happened at HBOS and the ensuing consequences for former colleagues, shareholders, taxpayers and society in general.  Shortly after I left HBOS, I received the enormous honour of a Knighthood in recognition of my own \u2013 and many other people's \u2013 contribution to the creation of a company which was then widely regarded as a great success. In view of what has happened subsequently to HBOS, I believe that it is right that I should now ask the appropriate authorities to take the necessary steps for its removal.  During the course of my 30-year career, including 12 years at Halifax and HBOS, I both contributed to and built up a substantial pension entitlement. This pension entitlement is entirely contractual in nature. However I have decided to forego 30% of my gross pension entitlement payable to me during the rest of my lifetime.* I will be discussing how this reduction is implemented, and whether the amount waived should go to support good causes, or benefit shareholders, with the pension scheme's employer and trustees.  It is with great personal sadness that I have decided to stand down from my voluntary position as a Trustee of Cancer Research UK. They do remarkable work and it has been a great privilege and pleasure to have played my part. However I want to put their interests firmly before mine and would wish them every success in the future.  Throughout my business career I have always tried to act with integrity and to the best of my abilities. I have had the enormous privilege of working with people and organisations about whom I cared deeply. I would like to express my sincere regret for events and my appreciation for the personal support I have been shown.  * The current annual pension payment amounts to c.\u00a3580,000 per annum. </blockquote>",

I would therefore like to repeat today what I said when I appeared in public before the Commission in December; namely that I am deeply sorry for what happened at HBOS and the ensuing consequences for former colleagues, shareholders, taxpayers and society in general. Shortly after I left HBOS, I received the enormous honour of a Knighthood in recognition of my own \u2013 and many other people's \u2013 contribution to the creation of a company which was then widely regarded as a great success. In view of what has happened subsequently to HBOS, I believe that it is right that I should now ask the appropriate authorities to take the necessary steps for its removal. During the course of my 30-year career, including 12 years at Halifax and HBOS, I both contributed to and built up a substantial pension entitlement. This pension entitlement is entirely contractual in nature. However I have decided to forego 30% of my gross pension entitlement payable to me during the rest of my lifetime.* I will be discussing how this reduction is implemented, and whether the amount waived should go to support good causes, or benefit shareholders, with the pension scheme's employer and trustees. It is with great personal sadness that I have decided to stand down from my voluntary position as a Trustee of Cancer Research UK. They do remarkable work and it has been a great privilege and pleasure to have played my part. However I want to put their interests firmly before mine and would wish them every success in the future. Throughout my business career I have always tried to act with integrity and to the best of my abilities. I have had the enormous privilege of working with people and organisations about whom I cared deeply. I would like to express my sincere regret for events and my appreciation for the personal support I have been shown. * The current annual pension payment amounts to c.\u00a3580,000 per annum.",

The recent stability of inflation was consistent with ample and persistent slack that made prices less responsive to the ups and downs of the economic cycle.</p> <p>\"In short, the dog did not bark because the combination of anchored expectations and credible central banks has made inflation move more slowly than caricatures from the 1970s might suggest \u2013 inflation has been muzzled.</p> <p>\"And, provided central banks remain free to respond appropriately, the dog is likely to remain so.\"</p> <p>The IMF said there were two caveats to its findings. \"First, moderate inflation could induce complacency \u2013 and complacency would be a mistake.\" Inflation had remained low in the first half of the 2000s, the Fund said, but that did not prevent many countries from experiencing rampant asset price inflation, particularly in property markets. \"These housing bubbles helped destabilise the global financial system and contributed to the subsequent recession.\"</p> <p>Drawing comparisons between the records of the US and Germany in coping with the high inflation of the 1970s, the Fund said the second threat would be if central bank independence were to be undermined. The paper said history \"clearly demonstrates the risks associated with curtailing appropriate monetary tightening in response to persistently rising inflation. The end result can be the disanchoring of inflation expectations and stagflation.\"</p> <p>The IMF said that in the wake of the \"Great Recession\" there was political urgency to reduce unemployment, as was the case in the 1970s. It also noted concerns that the stimulative impact of unconventional policies such as quantitative easing could gather momentum as economies recovered and that the policies might prove hard to reverse.</p> <p>\"Whatever the source, limits on central banks' independence and operational restrictions that limit their flexibility in responding to evolving challenges can cause problems and must be avoided.\"</p>",

Noting that inflation has been \"the dog that did not bark\", the IMF said that as long as inflation expectations remained low, \"fears about high inflation should not prevent monetary authorities from pursuing highly accommodative monetary policy\". The Fund's work on inflation is contained in a chapter of the half-yearly World Economic Outlook, pre-released ahead of next week's publication date. Its economists found that inflation had remained relatively steady for two reasons: the public had confidence in the ability of central banks to keep the cost of living under control, and inflation was far less responsive to the amount of spare capacity in the economy than it had been in the past. The recent stability of inflation was consistent with ample and persistent slack that made prices less responsive to the ups and downs of the economic cycle. \"In short, the dog did not bark because the combination of anchored expectations and credible central banks has made inflation move more slowly than caricatures from the 1970s might suggest \u2013 inflation has been muzzled. \"And, provided central banks remain free to respond appropriately, the dog is likely to remain so.\" The IMF said there were two caveats to its findings. \"First, moderate inflation could induce complacency \u2013 and complacency would be a mistake.\" Inflation had remained low in the first half of the 2000s, the Fund said, but that did not prevent many countries from experiencing rampant asset price inflation, particularly in property markets. \"These housing bubbles helped destabilise the global financial system and contributed to the subsequent recession.\" Drawing comparisons between the records of the US and Germany in coping with the high inflation of the 1970s, the Fund said the second threat would be if central bank independence were to be undermined. The paper said history \"clearly demonstrates the risks associated with curtailing appropriate monetary tightening in response to persistently rising inflation. The end result can be the disanchoring of inflation expectations and stagflation.\" The IMF said that in the wake of the \"Great Recession\" there was political urgency to reduce unemployment, as was the case in the 1970s. It also noted concerns that the stimulative impact of unconventional policies such as quantitative easing could gather momentum as economies recovered and that the policies might prove hard to reverse. \"Whatever the source, limits on central banks' independence and operational restrictions that limit their flexibility in responding to evolving challenges can cause problems and must be avoided.\"",
