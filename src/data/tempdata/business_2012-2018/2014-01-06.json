Tesco is expected to open its seventh dark store in Didcot, Oxfordshire, later this year. The UK's biggest online grocer opened two dark stores in 2013 and has previously said it is scouting for further sites in Birmingham and Manchester. Its newest centre in Erith, south east London, can process 4,000 orders a day and offer 30,000 different items, 50% more than the average store. The site has also been designed to help Tesco launch same-day deliveries, a service already offered by Asda and Ocado.</p> <p>Asda opened a dot.com distribution site in Nottingham last spring, adding to dark stores in Leeds and Enfield. Sainsbury's has said it will open its first dark store in Bromley-by-Bow, east London, \"within the next few years\".</p> <p>Retailers are being forced to open the new dark stores because delivering to thousands of homes demands a completely different set up to transporting bulky loads to a few hundred stores. Jon Neale, UK head of research for Jones Lang LaSalle, which detailed the plans in its 2014 property predictions report, said the increase in demand for sites was not only driven by more people buying online but by the concentration of shoppers in particular areas.</p> <p>\"The growth of internet shopping is about the changing nature of demand. It is more pronounced among certain demographics and is not distributed evenly across the country,\" he said.</p>",

But growing competition and demands from shoppers have encouraged supermarkets to open dark stores which enable them to ensure better availability and a faster, more efficient service. \"Dark stores really bring availability up and make internet shopping a more viable option for a lot more shoppers than when goods are picked in store,\" said Andy Stevens, senior retail analyst at market research firm Verdict.Waitrose will more than double the number of online delivery slots available when it opens its second dot.com fulfilment centre in south London this autumn. Tesco is expected to open its seventh dark store in Didcot, Oxfordshire, later this year. The UK's biggest online grocer opened two dark stores in 2013 and has previously said it is scouting for further sites in Birmingham and Manchester. Its newest centre in Erith, south east London, can process 4,000 orders a day and offer 30,000 different items, 50% more than the average store. The site has also been designed to help Tesco launch same-day deliveries, a service already offered by Asda and Ocado. Asda opened a dot.com distribution site in Nottingham last spring, adding to dark stores in Leeds and Enfield. Sainsbury's has said it will open its first dark store in Bromley-by-Bow, east London, \"within the next few years\". Retailers are being forced to open the new dark stores because delivering to thousands of homes demands a completely different set up to transporting bulky loads to a few hundred stores. Jon Neale, UK head of research for Jones Lang LaSalle, which detailed the plans in its 2014 property predictions report, said the increase in demand for sites was not only driven by more people buying online but by the concentration of shoppers in particular areas. \"The growth of internet shopping is about the changing nature of demand. It is more pronounced among certain demographics and is not distributed evenly across the country,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "All of Stewart McIntyre's customers are multimillionaires, many are billionaires and most are famous. With Michael Douglas, Eddie Jordan, Simon Cowell, John Travolta, Jenson Button and John Terry on speed-dial, he has the kind of contacts that would impress gossip blogger Perez Hilton. But this 57-year-old Scot's celebrity network is one of the more unlikely engines of Britain's industrial recovery. McIntyre is the boss of luxury yachtmaker Sunseeker, which, following the closure of BAE's Portsmouth shipyard, is one of the last flagbearers of Britain's once dominant maritime industry \u2013 a sector enjoying a showcase moment at the London Boat Show this week. Jordan has been on the phone to McIntyre a lot recently. The former Formula One boss is taking delivery of his latest Sunseeker \u2013 his eighth or ninth, McIntyre isn't quite sure \u2013 at the end of the month. The 155ft yacht is the biggest the Poole-based shipyard has ever built, and will set Jordan back a rumoured \u00a325m. Discretion being everything in the luxury goods industry, McIntyre refuses to speculate on the price. \"Wealthy people want only the new things and the latest things. In 2013 we had the largest number of new models and refreshed models we've ever done,\" he said. \"Everything is now more carbon fibre, more steel, more light.\" The company's second-biggest boat \u2013 a 130ft craft with cabins for 12 guests, compartments for seven crew, 12 bathrooms, six industrial fridge-freezers and a walk-in wardrobe \u2013 cost \u00a316.5m and has been sold to \"someone on the south of France\". It's so big it can't fit inside London's Excel centre, which is hosting the industry's most important trade fair. On the show's first day McIntyre sold a \u00a33m yacht straight off the company's stand. McIntyre, who lives in Edinburgh and has a flat in a marina in Poole, has collected more than 1m air miles criss-crossing the globe to meet clients. Last year he notched up more than 150 return flights. He admits to the thrill of meeting famous customers and says: \"Most of them are really nice.\" His network has also enabled him to introduce his 29-year-old son, a golf pro in Portugal, to some of the sport's biggest stars, including Lee Westwood, Darren Clarke and Rory McIlroy. But Sunseeker's real boom is from newly minted millionaires and billionaires emerging from China, Russia, Brazil and Mexico. More than half of the 35-year-old British company's customers now come from outside Europe, a \"huge increase on a few years ago\". The fastest growing market is Mexico, and the company will open new sales offices this summer in Colombia, Panama and Venezuela, which he said \"would never have happened five years ago\". Demand is also booming in the Seychelles, a 115-island archipelago in Indian Ocean, which is \"the latest playground for Middle Eastern investors\". But it is China that has emerged as the key to Sunseeker's future, after the company was sold last year to China's richest man, Wang Jianlin, for \u00a3300m. McIntyre said the Chinese were beginning to find their sea legs. He said that although it was not a maritime country, some wealthy Chinese were very keen to buy a boat in order to own a complete sweep of luxury assets. Sunseeker has recently fitted out Chinese boats with mahjong tables and karaoke rooms. Wang, whose property firm, Dalian Wanda Group, is building Europe's tallest residential tower in the Nine Elms development around Battersea Power Station, owns a 108ft Sunseeker Predator. McIntyre said his customers, whom he describes as \"high net worth to ultra-high net worth\", have been far less affected by the global economic downturn than ordinary people, but \"it doesn't stop them being very demanding on pricing\". He said demand for reductions was \"as bad now as it has ever been. People like getting a good deal.\" It means the company's profits are \"under pressure and will remain under pressure\" despite sales holding steady at \u00a3270m-\u00a3310m a year for the past five years. Pre-tax profits were \u00a320.7m in 2012, after the business reversed a loss of \u00a34.6m the previous year. The company's cheapest boat comes in at \u00a3400,000 including tax and delivery. \"You have to have some serious wealth [to buy one],\" he said. McIntyre, a keen sailor, is \"way away\" from being able to buy one, even with the company discount. He has had to settle for a \u00a3150,000 small cabin cruiser from a rival company. He said he was \"not bothered in the slightest\" about the wealth of his customers, but admitted to being fascinated by the influx of super-rich from all corners of the world. \"In every country, irrespective of its status, there are rich people,\" he said. \"We still sell boats to Lebanese [people], Egyptians and in Angola. We are still selling boats to people of these nationalities. We've sold to Libya.\" McIntyre said he \"tries not to think about where the money comes from\", but ensures that the company does everything it can to check the legitimacy of customers' funds. \"I'm a big believer in regulation,\" he said. \"We've had circumstances where we've returned the deposit because we can't get comfortable [with the origin of the customer's money].\" Despite the pressure on costs, he said Sunseeker would not consider moving manufacturing away from the company's Dorset base, where it employs 2,300 people. \"Britain has an amazing pedigree in maritime history, be it submarines or warships, and it is up to us to uphold our maritime industry,\" he said. \"The union jack is a huge asset to the brand, and it is in the DNA of the company. Being 'made in Britain' is very important to us, as it is to Rolls-Royce and Bentley. You wouldn't buy a Chinese Land Rover, you wouldn't buy an Indian Mercedes.\"",

He needn't bother. Many landlords are already doing the Treasury's work for it, turfing out low-income tenants who rely on housing benefit to meet rising rent demands. As The Guardian revealed on Saturday, Britain's biggest buy-to-let landlords, Fergus and Judith Wilson, the (heavily mortgaged) owners of nearly 1,000 homes in the Ashford area of Kent, have shut the door on housing benefit tenants, sending out 200 eviction notices. Other landlords have been doing the same for months. So will the government's housing benefit costs start to fall? Probably not. The Wilsons' evictions have struck most people as utterly heartless. Yet the truth about the Wilsons is that their properties - I have been inside many of them - are at the better end of the private rented sector (PRS). They are mostly new-build two- and three-bedroom estate homes which are perfectly liveable and relatively well-maintained. Where will the evicted tenants from such properties go? Into the clutches of the bottom-fishing end of the PRS: damp, multiple-occupation houses whose landlords spend nothing on maintenance or improvement, who despise their tenants but not the housing benefit they bring in. If anything, the housing benefit bill goes up, not down. Yet Osborne's desire to axe housing benefit will strike a chord with the electorate, who know a spending programme out of control when they see one. Housing benefit costs taxpayers around \u00a317bn a year \u2013 four times what we spend on jobseeker's allowance \u2013 and caps introduced since 2010 have been electorally popular. Critics of the cuts have to offer an alternative to bloated payments to rack-renting landlords. We used to have a housing programme in Britain but we have replaced building homes with paying benefits to landlords. More council homes is an obvious starting point, but a steep rise in the minimum wage would go further, slashing the cost of both housing benefit and tax credits. Even in the US minimum wages are rising rapidly. But the gradgrinds running Britain can't see that paying decent wages translates into a lower burden on the welfare state.",

William Nicholls, a dealer at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This week we have the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee minutes, ECB rates, BOE rates, and non-farm payrolls, as well as the start of the US earnings season. In particular, the FOMC on Wednesday night and non-farm number on Friday should get markets moving and speculating on future tapering \u2013 which is bound to be a major theme in 2014 again.</p> </blockquote> <p>So overall, the final scores were:</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged at 6730.73, up 0.06 points</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Germany's Dax was down 0.08% at 9428.00</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 France's Cac closed 0.47% lower at4227.54</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended up 0.63% at 19,233.74</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Spain's Ibex added 0.92% to 9888.5 after better than expected service sector data from the country</strong></p> <p>In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 40 points or 0.25%.</p> <p>And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening.

      "bodyText": "European markets have made a cautious start to the first full trading week of the new year, writes my colleague Nick Fletcher. With Chinese, UK and US service sector data disappointing, and a mixed picture from the European figures, investors took a cautious stance ahead of a busy schedule of economic news. Among other events, the US Federal Reserve releases its latest minutes, non-farm payroll numbers are out on Friday while the Bank of England and European Central Bank hold their latest scheduled meetings. William Nicholls, a dealer at Capital Spreads, said: This week we have the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee minutes, ECB rates, BOE rates, and non-farm payrolls, as well as the start of the US earnings season. In particular, the FOMC on Wednesday night and non-farm number on Friday should get markets moving and speculating on future tapering \u2013 which is bound to be a major theme in 2014 again. So overall, the final scores were: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged at 6730.73, up 0.06 points \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 0.08% at 9428.00 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.47% lower at4227.54 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended up 0.63% at 19,233.74 \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 0.92% to 9888.5 after better than expected service sector data from the country In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 40 points or 0.25%. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Now here's a thing. Goldman Sachs seems to be eschewing its usual secrecy, merrily tweeting pictures of its new look London offices: Just to flag up an event later tonight, the US Senate is expected to confirm Janet Yellen as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, making her the first woman to head the US central bank. My colleague Dominic Rushe has the full story here: Senate to confirm Janet Yellen as next Federal Reserve chair Over at Goodyear\u2019s Amiens-Nord factory in Northern France, two managers have reportedly been taken hostage by the CGT union and other workers in a dispute over closing a plant. Thanks to reader BabyBoomer55 for flagging up Bloomberg's story, in the comments below. Curious.... the gold price just took a tumble, only to bounce back almost immediately. It sent the spot price of gold dropping from $1,246 per ounce to $1,233 per ounce in a flash; it's now back at $1.2442. Back to the US...... and the Institute for Supply Management has reported that America's service sector grew less vigorously than expected in December. The ISM's closely watched index (which is separate to Markit's data) fell to 53 in December, from 53.9 in November. That still shows growth, but is the lowest reading since June -- and rather weaker than the 54.5 which Wall Street analysts had forecast. ISM's new orders index fell to 49.4 -- suggesting a drop in new business for the first time since July 2009. So, a gloomier picture than Markit suggested an hour ago. The city watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, has just announced it will conduct an enforcement investigation into Co-op Bank, hot on the heels of the probe announced by the PRA a few minutes ago (see previous post). The FCA also pointed out that the review promised by George Osborne last year into the near-collapse of the lender will begin once there's no danger of prejudicing either of these inquiries. Here's the FCA's statement: The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has confirmed it will be undertaking enforcement investigations into events at the Co-operative Bank. The investigation will look at the decisions and events up to June 2013. The independent review announced by the Chancellor will commence once it is clear that it will not prejudice any actions that the regulators may take. This sequencing is necessary to ensure that the outcomes of the enforcement work are not prejudiced and follows the approach taken for both the RBS and HBOS reports. The Bank of England has just announced that its Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) is conducting a formal \"enforcement investigation\" into the Co-op Bank. The probe will examine the role of 'former senior managers' at the troubled organisation. Here's the full statement: The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) confirms it is undertaking an enforcement investigation in relation to the Co-operative Bank and as part of that investigation will consider the role of former senior managers. No further information will be provided on the investigation until the legal process has concluded and an outcome has been reached. The Treasury has previously indicated that the independent review announced by the Chancellor will not start until it is clear that it will not prejudice any actions that the regulators may take. The PRA will work with the Treasury to ensure that the enforcement investigation and the independent review are sequenced appropriately. The Co-op Bank was hit by a series of blows last year, including the discovery of a \u00a31.5bn black hole and the scandal over its former chairman, the reverend Paul Flowers. And we're off.... 14:30 - DOW JONES UP 28.00 POINTS, OR 0.17 PERCENT, AT 16,497.99 AFTER MARKET OPEN 14:30 - NASDAQ UP 5.47 POINTS, OR 0.13 PERCENT, AT 4,137.38 AFTER MARKET OPEN 14:30 - S&amp;P 500 UP 3.42 POINTS, OR 0.19 PERCENT, AT 1,834.79 AFTER MARKET OPEN Nearly time for Wall Street to open, and the Dow Jones industrial average is expected to rise modestly... Growth in America's service sector slowed a little in December, but remained comfortably in 'expansion' territory, according to Markit's latest report. The US Service sector PMI fell to 55.7, down from November's 55.9, suggesting the sector expanded at a very slightly slower rate. Encouragingly, firms reported a pick-up in new orders - rising at the fastest rate since April 2012. Employment at US service firms also rose strongly and at one of the fastest rates since Markit started reporting the US PMI four years ago. And there was a rise in confidence, as this graph shows: When last week's US manufacturing data is included, the overall US composite PMI came in at 56.1, down very slightly on November's 56.2. That suggests steady growth across the US private sector last month. Britain's headline borrowing costs have dropped today, after this morning's service sector survey showed that activity grew at the slowest rate since June. The yield (or interest rate) on 10-year gilts has fallen to 2.98%, from 3.03% on Friday night. Bond traders may be calculating that the Service sector PMI suggests less chance of an early tightening of monetary policy. They're also digesting speculation that the Bank of England might tweak its forward guidance, to dampen the prospect of interest rates being raised soon. Britain's bosses are much more confident about the economy than a year ago, according to a survey from the Institute of Directors which just landed in my inbox. 87% of IoD members expect UK GDP growth to be higher in 2014 than in 2013, and many also expect higher revenues and profitability this year within their own firms: IoD\u2019s Chief Economist, James Sproule, said the survey is the latest evidence that the UK economy is recovering: \u201cOur survey is another sign that the economy is indeed recovering. While the view of the IoD is that economic expansion remains too dependent upon consumer spending, funded in large part by a shrinkage in the savings rate, the fact that 74 per cent of businesses are anticipating higher revenue does point to a welcome broadening of economic growth. Hopefully, this optimism can also translate into higher wages - ending the long squeeze on real incomes. Here's a handy round-up of today's economic data, from Reuters (with links to the liveblog for more details): Service industry growth slowed sharply in China as 2013 drew to a close but picked up across most of Europe, suggesting still very uneven global economic performance even as most signs point to a strengthening U.S. revival. Taken together with business surveys on manufacturing published late last week, the data suggest that an onslaught of global central bank stimulus has had some impact but is not likely to halt any time soon. Indeed, while business has picked up in many places, particularly in the euro zone which only recently escaped recession, inflation has been on a downward trend in most industrialised countries. Asian shares fell to a three-week low after news the HSBC/Markit China services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to a two-year low of 50.9 from 52.5, underscoring nervousness about how the world's second largest economy is performing. The equivalent Markit survey for the euro zone went the opposite way, rising to 52.1 from 51.7, with new orders coming in at their fastest pace in more than two years. Any number above 50 denotes expansion. \"That just goes to confirm everyone's suspicions that the Chinese economy is shifting down onto a lower growth path, and that we will see a more balanced growth pattern across the world this year,\" said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank. He expects improved growth in Europe and the United States. We get the US Service sector PMI data this afternoon..... Back on Angela Merkel's accident briefly, Reuters reports that the German chancellor will not be at Davos later this month (something I mentioned earlier): Merkel will not attend the World Economic Forum later this month but not because of her skiing accident, Seibert said, adding that the meeting in Davos at the end of January clashed with a scheduled German government meeting. In the financial markets, Spain's IBEX is the best-performing share index in Europe following the news that activity across the Spanish private sector has risen at the fastest pace in six years. It's a pretty calm picture otherwise -- Angela Merkel's accident hasn't caused any anxiety on the Frankfurt trading floor. FTSE 100: up 1 point at 6731, + 0.01% German DAX: up 27 points at 9462, + 0.3% French CAC: up 6 points at 4253, + 0.14% Spanish IBEX: up 80 points at 9878, +0.8% Italian FTSE MIB: up 140 points at 19,252, + 0.7% Toby Morris, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, says markets lack 'clear direction' today, after the flurry of economic data: Most of Europe has posted modest gains amidst mixed PMI data at the start of the first full trading week of the New Year. Spain's recovery continues to gain momentum, with the service sector notching up its strongest growth rate in 6\u00bd years and helping the IBEX top the main Euro benchmarks. Carl Astorri, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says George Osborne has put welfare benefits in the firing line for the next parliament: We already knew that the Government was planning further deep cuts in spending in the next Parliament but until today we had heard very little about how those cuts were likely to be distributed beyond the first year. \u201cToday\u2019s speech continues the narrative that the Chancellor set out in his Autumn Statement by suggesting that there will be a much greater focus on welfare going forwards. This would be a big change compared with the current Parliament where Government departments have borne the brunt of the cuts. \u201cThere are obvious political factors behind this change of tack, but it is also a pragmatic decision. These cuts are due to be even deeper than those already allocated but the departmental cuts have been so great that they would struggle to achieve any further savings \u2013 particularly if they continue to protect health and large parts of education. Therefore it was inevitable that the Chancellor would have to look at these other areas of spending which, thus far, have seen very little action.\u201d While the TUC's Duncan Weldon tweets that the economic debate will change this year: Returning to the UK's chancellor...and the Treasury have uploaded the full text of George Osborne's speech on the economy: New Year economy speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer It includes a warning from George Osborne that the eurozone remains \"weak\", and a declaration that both the UK government and the welfare bill must be \"permanently smaller\". I can tell you today that on the Treasury\u2019s current forecasts, \u00a312 billion of further welfare cuts are needed in the first two years of next Parliament. That\u2019s how to reduce the deficit without even faster cuts to government departments, or big tax rises on people. Here's more, from our political correspondent Rowena Mason: George Osborne warns of more cuts and austerity in 'year of hard truths' Osborne's speech has been criticised by Labour's Ed Balls, who said the chancellor's austerity cutbacks are to blame for Britain's deficit being too high: \"This failure means Labour will have to make cuts and in 2015/16 there will be no more borrowing for day-to-day spending. But we will get the deficit down in a fair way, not give tax cuts to millionaires. And we know that the way to mitigate the scale of the cuts needed is to earn and grow our way to higher living standards for all. \"The social security bill is rising under George Osborne, but the best way to get it down for the long-term is to get people into work and build more homes. The Tories should back our compulsory jobs guarantee for young people and the long-term unemployed. And in tough times it cannot be a priority to continue paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest five per cent of pensioners. Our World News desk has an early take on Angela Merkel's skiing injury, which has forced the chancellor to cancel a trip to Poland this week. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has fractured her pelvis in a skiing holiday in Switzerland, forcing her to cancel meetings for the next three weeks. Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said on Monday that the chancellor suffered what she first thought was just a bruise to her left rear pelvic area while cross-country skiing. Doctors told her on Friday that the injury was in fact an \"incomplete\" bone fracture that will require her to rest for three weeks. Seibert told reporters that Merkel is walking with the help of crutches and would need to cancel a number of official appointments in the coming weeks but would continue to lead the government and hold cabinet meetings. Merkel will lead a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, which will be the first gathering of all the ministers in the new \"grand coalition\" government of her conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats, which was formalised last month. Seibert said Merkel's fall occurred \"at low speeds\" but was unable to say if another person was involved. Keep watching for updates: Angela Merkel injured in skiing accident Reuters reports that Angela Merkel is using crutches to get around: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has fractured her pelvis in a cross-country skiing accident and is walking with the help of crutches, forcing her to call off some foreign visits and official appointments, her spokesman said on Monday. Merkel fell while skiing over the Christmas vacation. What she first thought was heavy bruising turned out to be a partial fracture, meaning she must take it easy for three weeks and work from home where possible, said her spokesman Steffen Seibert.\"The chancellor is of course able to work and is in full communication,\" said Seibert. He added that Merkel's accident occurred \"at low speed\" but he declined to give further details. The chancellor is no stranger to crutches -- as this photo from 2011 shows, she took to them almost three years ago after a knee operation, to keep working while she recovered. Angela Merkel's injury could potentially prevent her attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, which begins in a little over a fortnight's time. Davos's icy pavements are notoriously perilous, so the chancellor would certainly be wise to keep away. However, that would mean missing out on the chance to hobnob with other world leaders, and top economists and business leaders. And here's the Financial Times' s early take on Angela Merkel's accident. (via fastFT): Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has been injured in a cross country skiing accident and is under doctor's orders to rest for three weeks. Ms Merkel's spokesman said on Monday she has been told to rest for three weeks after the mishap, reports the FT's Stefan Wagstyl. She has postponed a trip to Poland as well as meetings in Berlin, he said, However she is working and is in full contact with her officials, he said. A bit more detail... Angela Merkel will be stuck in bed for most of the next three weeks after injuring herself skiing, her spokesman has confirmed. Here's the WSJ's early take: BERLIN\u2014German Chancellor Angela Merkel has injured her pelvis in a cross-country skiing trip during her Christmas vacation and will have to be mostly bound to bed for the next three weeks, her spokesman said Monday. As a result, the chancellor has canceled her visit to Warsaw that was scheduled for Wednesday and canceled a meeting with Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, said Ms. Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert. Twitter is buzzing with reports that German chancellor Angela Merkel has been injured while skiing. According to AFP, Mrs Merkel has been forced to cancel meetings and won't be able to travel for several weeks. Our correspondents in Germany are on the case.... Time to round up this morning's data, so we can move onto other matters: \u2022 Growth in Britain's dominant service sector has slowed to its weakest rate in six months, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers across the sector. Details and charts here. Economists say the drop in the UK service PMI, from 60 to 58.8 in December, is disappointing, but that service sector firms are still pretty healthy. Indeed, UK service sector growth for the October-December period was the strongest on record, despite last month's dip. Markit, which compiles the data, reckons the UK may have grown by as much as 1% in the final three months of 2013. \u2022 In the eurozone, private sector activity picked up for the second month in a row -- at the second-highest rate recorded in two and a half years. The data suggests the eurozone economy picked up at the end of last year \u2022 But France was a poor performer, again, adding to fears that the eurozone's second largest member is falling back into recession. Its Service sector PMI fell to 47.8, from 48, showing a deeper downturn. \u2022 The latest data from Italy was also disappointing -- its service sector shrank again last month. Like France, it suffered from declining new orders. \u2022 There was much better news from Spain, though, where the private sector grew at the fastest rate in 77 months after a surge in service sector activity. \u2022 And it was another solid month for Germany, with firms reporting an increase in activity and hiring. It's disappointing that UK service sector growth fell to a six-month low in December, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. Still, the sector is growing faster than we imagined a year ago: Services activity was always highly unlikely to sustain the very strong growth rates recently indicated by the survey (the October reading was a 16-year high) and this is still a very strong report overall showing healthy expansion, robust incoming business, markedly rising employment and confidence in the sector at a near four-year high. In short, this is still a survey that would have been killed for at the beginning of 2013! Head's up, George Osborne's in a factory in Birmingham, giving his speech on the economy in 2014 As flagged up, the chancellor is warning of more cuts to come. Andy Sparrow is tracking every word in his Politics liveblog: Today's service sector survey, and last week's data from the UK's manufacturing and construction firms, suggest Britain's economy may have expanded by as much as 1% in the last three months. That would mean faster growth, as UK GDP rose by 0.8% between July and September. But it might also mark the high point in the recovery, given that service sector growth hit a six-month low last month..... Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, the currency brokers, says today's data shows the \"hot streak\" in Britain's service sector is over. And while 2013 was a strong year, 2014 could be tougher unless workers finally see real wages rising, he added: \u201cDespite this slight disappointment in December, the services industry expanded every single month in 2013 and, alongside the expansion in both manufacturing and construction sectors, should see Q4 GDP running at around 0.9%. \u201cEncouragement can be found within the release from the new orders and employment components, which both expanded at close to record levels and point to a continued level of service sector expansion. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the majority of this growth is from business-to-business activity. All companies that rely on the UK consumer will remain wary moving into 2014, as a lack of real wage increases continues to hit the man-in-the-street\u2019s pockets\u2026\u201d Growth in Britain's service sector slowed unexpectedly in December to a six month low, according to Markit's latest data. But December was still a pretty decent month for the sector, suggesting the UK economy will grow by more than 0.8% in the final quarter of 2013. Markit's monthly Service sector PMI fell to 58.8, down from 60.0, surprising City analysts who had expected it to rise slightly to 60.3. It's the weakest reading since June. But while the pace of growth eased, firms were still upbeat. Markit found that: The UK service sector continued to expand strongly as 2013 came to an end, with activity, new business and employment all again rising at marked rates. Crucially, firms grew more confident in December as new business rose: Market confidence was reportedly high, according to panellists, with clients enjoying access to larger funds and, perhaps more importantly, willing to commit these to new contracts. Increased marketing and the release of new products also bolstered sales with both new and existing customers. And at 58.8, Britain's service sector outpaced its major European rivals. Here's the key graphs: David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, cheered the data: \u201cThe UK services sector continues to hit the high notes as business confidence surged to its highest level in nearly 4 years. The average new business growth rate in the final quarter of 2013 was the best in the survey\u2019s history, suggesting a very bright outlook for 2014. The stronger positive outlook also offers a platform for investment and expansion in new products and marketing, sustaining the continued broad based recovery in the New Year. And economist Shaun Richards tweets the the sector is still achieving strong growth. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, reckons today's data suggests Europe's economy should continue to recover in 2014, although France may have fallen back into recession: He said: \u201cThe PMI surveys indicate that the eurozone recovery gained further traction at the end of last year. December saw the second-largest increase in business activity since June 2011 and rounded off the best quarter for two-and-a-half years. \u201cAlthough consistent with a mere 0.2% expansion of GDP during the final quarter, the PMI signalled a strong turnaround in the health of the economy during the course of 2013, and stronger growth looks likely for the first quarter of 2014. \u201cMost importantly, the labour market stabilised in December, ending a period of falling employment that lasted nearly two years. With inflows of new work accelerating, a return to jobs growth should be seen in 2014. The revival in consumer confidence that should result from the labour market improvement should provide an all-important boost to the economy in 2014. \u201cHowever, while the region as a whole looks set for a strengthening recovery in 2014, growth is uneven, with France in particular having possibly slid back into recession late last year. The upturn in the rest of the region may help bring about a return to growth in France, but the data are highlighting the need for structural reforms to bring about a more sustainable and robust recovery in the region\u2019s second-largest economy.\u201d The Eurozone's private sector continued to recover in December, but France and Italy's service sectors stumbled as weak domestic demand held back their recovery. And there was no improvement (yet) in the region's labour market, where unemployment remains around record levels. But at least firms appear to have stopped laying off staff. That's the main message from Markit, whose composite survey of activity across the region rose to 52.1 in December, up from 51.7 in November, to the second- highest level since the middle of 2011. In a report titled\" Eurozone economic recovery accelerates at end of 2013\", Markit said that \"manufacturing continued to lead the recovery in December\", with production growth at its fastest since May 2011. Service sector business activity grew too, but at the slowest pace in four-months -- dragged back by France (see 9.03am for details) and Italy (see 8.55am). Final Eurozone Composite Output Index: 52.1 (Flash 52.1, November 51.7) Final Eurozone Services Business Activity Index: 51.0 (Flash 51.0, November 51.2) Nations ranked by all-sector output growth (Dec.) Ireland 58.6 -- 2-month high Germany 55.0 -- 2-month low Spain 53.9 -- 77-month high Italy 50.0 -- 2-month high France 47.3 -- 7-month low Reaction to follow.... Once again, Germany proves immune to problems in other parts of the eurozone. German service sector firms reported that December was a pretty decent month, with activity rising at a robust pace again. And while the pace of expansion did slow compared with November, firms hired new staff at the fastest rate in two years, The German Service sector PMI was 53.5, down on November's 55.7, but still showing a solid rise in activity (anything over 50=growth). German services firms said they saw a \"continued rebound in new work during December\". Overall, Germany's private sector recorded its eighth consecutive month of rising activity, with December being the second-strongest rate of output expansion since June 2011. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said the eurozone's largest economy ended last year in pretty decent shape. \u201cGermany\u2019s private sector finished 2013 with a further strong expansion of business activity, despite service providers indicating a moderation in growth from the near two-and-a-half year peak seen during November. The improving underlying business climate in Germany led to a rebound in job creation during December, with manufacturing employment returning to growth while service sector companies added to their workforce numbers at the fastest rate for two years. And there's bad news for France too - its service sector activity fell at the sharpest rate since June last month as the country's firms suffered a drop in new business. The French service sector PMI fell to 47.8 in December, down from 48.0 in November, showing the sector entered a deeper contraction in the final weeks of 2013. New business at French service providers fell for the third month running, and firms cut jobs at a faster rate, underlining the troubled nature of the French economy.] The 'composite' measure of private sector activity in France (including its manufacturing sector), fell to a seven-month low, as the graph above shows. Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit, said French firms remain optimistic, despite facing a tough struggle in December: \u201cThe French service sector lost further ground in December, with business activity falling at the sharpest rate in six months. Persistently weak demand continues to impact on the sector\u2019s performance, with firms reporting continued declines in both new business and backlogs of work. However, firms hold some positivity that the situation will improve in 2014, with business expectations holding at a level better those seen over much of the past year-and-a-half.\u201d Oh dear - Italian service sector companies have reported that activity continued to decline in December as new work dried up, forcing many to cut jobs again. The Italian Service PMI fell to 47.9 last month, up slightly on 47.2 in November. That shows that the sector contracted again, but at a slightly slower pace (anything below 50 shows falling activity) Markit warned that Italian service sector firms suffered from \" a weakening of demand....which in turn contributed to further job losses and output price reductions across the sector.\" Here's the key points: \uf0a7 Second straight monthly decrease in business activity \uf0a7 Further solid drop in employment levels \uf0a7 Input price inflation lowest in three months Phil Smith, economist at Markit, commented: \u201cRecent data have disappointed following the successive increases in business activity through September and October. The service sector looks to have weighed on GDP in the final quarter but, thanks to a robust expansion in manufacturing output, the overall trend in economic activity is broadly flat. Further notable job shedding at services firms however places upward pressure on an already high unemployment rate, which will do nothing to ease social tensions.\u201d UK chancellor George Osborne has warned that Britain faces another \u00a325bn of spending cuts after the next election, and put welfare spending firmly in the firing line. Ahead of a big speech on the economy in 2014, Osborne told the Today Programme that further cutbacks are needed to lower Britain's deficit. He said: \"We need to find a further 25 billion pounds of cuts after the election. We have to make decisions about where those cuts are to be found This enormous welfare budget, that ultimately is where you can find substantial savings.\" Our politics liveblogger, Andy Sparrow, will be covering Osborne's speech and all the ensuing reaction in his liveblog: George Osborne calls for \u00a325bn spending cuts: Politics live blog Meanwhile in Switzerland, last year's slump in the gold price has left the country's central bank looking at a hefty loss. The Swiss National Bank reported this morning that it made a loss of 9bn Swiss francs in 2013 (around \u00a36bn), after the value of its gold reserves tumbled by 15bn Swiss francs. As Reuters explains, the loss could cause some ructions in Switzerland: The SNB said a 15 billion franc loss on its gold holdings, which lost 28 percent of its value last year, could not entirely be offset by a gain of roughly 3 billion francs from foreign currency and profits of more than 3 billion francs from selling a stabilisation fund set up five years ago to bail out UBS during the financial crisis. The loss is likely to be politically charged as its means the central bank cannot distribute dividends to its biggest shareholders, Switzerland's 26 cantons, or states, or to the federal government. And here's the key graph showing how Spain's service sector has enjoyed its strongest growth in over six years. Boom. Spain's service sector has reported the sharpest rise in activity since July 2007 -- the month before the credit crunch struck the global economy -- indicating a turnaround in the Spanish economy after several years of gloom. Markit's survey of purchasing managers across Spain found the firms reported a rise in new orders, improved business conditions and an increase in client demand. This sent Markit's Spanish Service Sector PMI jumping to 54.2 in December from 51.5 in November. This was the second successive reading above the 50.0 no-change mark and signalled the sharpest rise in activity since July 2007, it said. Staffing levels still fell, but the rate of job cuts eased for the second month running and was the slowest since the current sequence of falling employment began in March 2008. Here's the key points: Activity and new orders expand at sharpest pace for over six years Slowest fall in employment since March 2008 Further marked reduction in output prices Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, is pretty upbeat: \u201cThe latest services PMI data provide real optimism that in 2014 we could finally see the start of a meaningful economic recovery in Spain. Activity and new business each rose at rates not seen since prior to the economic crisis, although the extent to which companies are relying on discounting to support growth of orders remains a worry. There even look to be signs of positive movement in the labour market, with the sector coming close to seeing a stabilisation in employment in December.\u201d Frederik Ducrozet of Credit Agricole also suggests the report shows the eurozone's periphery is recovering: The slowdown in Chinese service sector helped to wipe almost 2.4% off Japan's Nikkei on the first day of trading in Tokyo this year. It fell 382 points to 15908, having ended 2013 at a six-year high. Guy Stear, Asian credit and equity strategist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong, told Reuters that: \"The focal point of the Asian markets is more on Chinese growth and on Chinese political situation and how it's going to pan out this year, rather than worrying about how tapering will affect Asia specifically,\" (tapering = US Federal Reserve ending its bond-buying stimulus plan) Hong Kong's private sector (manufacturing and services firms) also reported that activity grew at a slower rate last month: India's economy continued to deteriorate last month, according to the latest survey of its services companies. The Indian service sector PMI fell to 46.7 in December, from 47.2, signalling a deeper contraction. Firms reported that new orders fell at the quickest pace since September, due to an \"increasingly fragile economy and competitive pressures\", according to the report (from Markit and HSBC) Leif Eskesen, Chief Economist for India &amp; ASEAN at HSBC said: \u201cThe service sector continues to face headwinds, with weakening new business dragging down activity. On a positive note, inflation pressures are easing and optimism about the coming year is rising.\u201d Asian stock markets have fallen to three week lows after China's service sector posted the slowest growth in over two years. The closely watched China Services PMI, which measures activity across the country's service sector firms, dropped to 50.9 last month, sharply own from 52.5 in November. That's the weakest reading since August 2011, and shows only modest growth. The data, published by HSBC and Markit, is further evidence that China's economy is losing some oomph as Beijing tries to rein in excessive credit and rebalance towards growth. Here's the key points from the report: \u2022 Output and new orders increase at weaker rates at both manufacturers and service providers \u2022 Manufacturers reduce their payroll numbers, while service providers hire additional staff \u2022 Inflationary pressures ease to five-month low at the composite level Hongbin Qu, HSBC's chief economist for China, said that new business growth had slowed in December to a six-month low, but that firms remained optimistic, adding that: The implementation of reforms such as lowering the entry barriers for private business in service sectors and the expanded VAT reforms should help to revitalise service sectors in the year ahead. But Asian stock markets took the news badly, with China's CSI300 index sliding over 2.2%. And Japan's Nikkei is down 2.5%, as Tokyo traders begin the year with a bout of selling (catching up with last week's losses in Europe and on Wall Street). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. Plenty of economic news coming up this morning, at the start of the first full trading week of 2014. Surveys of service sector companies from across the globe will be released over the coming hours, giving an insight into how countries performed in December. The readings from the eurozone should show whether the region's weaker members are recovering: Data from China and India has already been released, and neither was very encouraging . The Chinese Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) showed a sharp drop in growth, while India's service sector has now been shrinking for six months in a row (more details to follow). The UK, though, is expected to post another strong reading. Also coming up today.... chancellor George Osborne is expected to warn that the UK faces \"a year of hard truths\", with more cuts on the way. Here's our preview: George Osborne says more cuts on way in 'year of hard truths' And the US Senate is expected to confirm Janet Yellen as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, succeeding Ben Bernanke, this afternoon.

Worries about festive trading left a number of retailers nursing losses. Marks &amp; Spencer dropped 3.7p to 440.3p, as Citigroup cut its price target from 575p to 510p albeit maintaining its buy rating. Citi said: Ahead of the third quarter trading statement due on 9 January, we have trimmed our 2014 pretax profit forecast by \u00a310m to \u00a3630m following recent trading statements (from Debenhams and Next) and higher clothing market discount activity in the pre-Christmas trading period We have adjusted our third quarter general merchandise sales and gross margin forecasts to reflect recent market commentary and now forecast a 0.5% third quarter like for like [decline]. J Sainsbury fell 6.2p to 367.8p ahead of an update on Wednesday, but Tesco, which reports on Thursday along with Marks, recovered from early falls to close 1.7p higher at 332.2p. Elsewhere Petrofac, the energy services group, climbed 10p to \u00a312.31 after Deutsche Bank moved from hold to buy. But Wood Group lost 25.5p to 652p as Deutsche reduced its recommendation, saying: Although we see the recent sell-off as overdone, with limited earnings growth potential in 2014-15 and lower valuation upside versus peers we downgrade to hold [from buy]. Among the mid-caps, recruitment group Hays was 2.8p higher at 134.6p as traders heard vague talk of a possible bid of around 200p a share. US group Manpower was said to be interested, as was a European bidder such as Adecco, which reportedly had Hays in its sights a few years ago. Restaurant Group, whose brands include Frankie &amp; Benny's and Chiquito, rose 22p to 612.5p ahead of an update on Thursday. Nick Batram at Peel Hunt said: We expect the group to deliver another solid performance at least in line with expectations in the absence of any late weather issues. Like-for-likes in the fourth quarter were up against tough comparisons (an increase of around 11%) and we expect the full year to come in around 2.5%-3%, versus the 3.5% reported for the first 45 weeks. Restaurant Group has an impressive record of double-digit earnings per share and dividend growth over what has been a challenging period for the consumer. With the pipeline likely to surprise on the upside, and returns on investment in excess of 30%, the stock remains a core buy in the sector. Finally, pallets would not necessarily seem to be the most exciting of businesses, but sector specialist RM2 International made a bright start to life on Aim. Shares in the company, which manufacture and rents glass fibre and resin pallets, jumped from 88p to 100p. It has a number of City names on board as non-executive directors, including Sir Stuart Rose of Marks &amp; Spencer fame and ex-Diageo boss Paul Walsh.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's services sector ended 2013 on a strong note. Sure, the snapshot provided by the CIPS/Markit survey was a bit lower than the City had expected but if there was a case for not reading too much into one month's data, this was it. Let's start with the headline number for the purchasing managers' index (PMI), which at 58.8 was well above the cut-off point that divides an expanding sector from one that is contracting. The average for the final three months of 2013 \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend \u2013 was 60.4, slightly up on the previous quarter and far better than any forecaster was predicting at the start of the year. This is not a case where services are doing well but the rest of the economy is struggling. Last week's PMIs for manufacturing and construction were also upbeat and a weighted average of the three sectors would suggest that the economy grew by 1.5% in the final quarter of 2013. That looks far too high a number, in part because the PMIs have tended to overstate the pace of expansion and in part because the service sector component does not include retailing, where the absence of real income growth seems to have made consumers cautious in the runup to Christmas. Living standards hold the key to the performance of the economy in 2014. At present, businesses are in optimistic mood. New orders are coming in and firms feel confident enough to take on more staff. It is worth noting, though, that the real strength of the service sector PMI came in business-to-business services: IT, transport and communication, and finance. The weakest sectors were those that depend on discretionary consumer spending: restaurants and hotels, and personal services. The outlook for the consumer-facing parts of the service sector should improve during 2014. Higher employment will in itself increase spending, but if it also increases competition for labour the upshot will be higher wages, the first increase in real incomes since 2009 and the strongest year of growth for the economy since 2007, the year the financial crisis began.",

      "bodyText": "It is a blustery winter morning in Mayfair, London, and 100 or so well-heeled representatives from the advertising and retail worlds are huddled in a lecture theatre at the Royal Institution. This is the future of food, according to Stylus, an \"innovation, research and advisory firm\" that scours global markets to pinpoint the most influential emerging trends for companies such as Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Bacardi and Hotel Chocolat. Digital dining Edible QR codes Harney Sushi, a restaurant in San Diego, has attempted to tackle the problem that 52% of Californian seafood is supposedly being mislabelled, by devising edible rice paper QR codes. Using smartphones, diners can call up detailed information about the provenance and global stocks of the fish they've ordered. Interactive cocktail lounges Logbar in Tokyo issues customers with iPad Minis upon entry. The menu is on the tablet, which you can also use to communicate with other drinkers and view, \"like\" and order what they're drinking. You can even invent your own cocktail and add it to the menu, earning a 50 yen (about 30p) commission when someone else buys one. Holographic chefs A finalist in a cutting-edge product design competition, Electrolux Design Lab, plans to bring top chefs into users' kitchens for tutorials via the medium of hologram. Burger-bots Momentum Machines' robot churns out 360 gourmet burgers an hour, chopping all ingredients as it goes so that everything is fresh, fresh, fresh. Orders can be customised, too. You want a patty of one-third pork and two-thirds bison? No problem. Smart knives Another Electrolux Design Lab contender is a knife that can check levels of harmful bacteria, pesticides and nutrients such as sugar, vitamins, protein and fat in the food it cuts. It also emits negative ions to help keep the food fresh. Alcohol-aware ice cubes Keep one of these in your glass and it will warn you when you're guzzling too fast, and send a text message to a close friend if you ignore it. When you're drinking moderately, the cube flashes green in time with the ambient music. If you start drinking more quickly it moves to amber, and red is your final warning. The augmented-reality diet Researchers in Tokyo found that using headsets to make food look one and a half times bigger led to a 10% decrease in consumption. Cue Google Glass designers jostling to create the ultimate diet app. Telltale teeth For those who think Google Glass seems intrusive, a sensor embedded in a molar is the stuff of nightmares. Developed by Taiwanese scientists, it can tell when you're eating, drinking, smoking and coughing. \"All of this data can be sent to your doctor or dentist to provide an accurate picture of your daily consumption habits,\" says Tessa Mansfield of Stylus. \"On a more alarming note,\" she adds, \"could this information be shared with our insurance companies?\" The new food aesthetic 3D printing The exquisite geometric sculptures created by The Sugar Lab are the shape of confectionary to come, as the 3D-printing trend takes off. Laser cutting Designer Andrew Stellitano engraves ham, laser-cuts biscuits into Louis Vuitton logos and makes topographic art out of lasagne. It is all rather beautiful, in an unnaturally perfect sort of way. Meanwhile IDEO, a design firm, has used a laser to write on a pork chop for a poster campaign. Food tattoos A Spanish company has developed laser tattoos for fresh produce, which can safely apply logos, provenance details and even QR codes on to fruit and veg. So long, irritating and un-eco stickers. Dejunking junk food \"Health\" chocolate With an increasing number of well-off older people wanting to stay fit, bigging up the functional properties of products is considered a good business bet. Expect to see more along the lines of French fruity chocolate Wellness Cacao, probiotic Ohso bars and IQ \"superfood\" chocolate. Kale lollies Nothing, it seems, can stop the march of the kale evangelists. Next summer, forget Magnums \u2013 it's all about the kale ice lolly. Chia pods Chia, an ancient grain that is favoured by vegan raw foodists as a great source of protein, omega-3, fibre and slow-release carbohydrate, has been morphed into a snack food. Mixed with coconut milk and fruit, it comes in a dinky \"pod\" with a spoon. Expect to see more chia products for \"on-the-go nutrition\", as Stylus's Mandy Saven puts it. The new jerky EPIC bars are animal-based protein snacks (turkey, bison, beef) that are billed as highly nutritious, sugar-free and \"just like our ancestors' ate\". \"Paleo-diet friendly!\" Egg-white crisps IPS (Intelligent Protein Snacks) contain protein, half the fat of regular crisps and fewer carbs, too. No mention of salt levels, though. Savoury yoghurts Carrot, tomato, parsnip and beetroot yogurts are a thing in New York. Milk from grass-fed cows and naturally sweet vegetables seem a winning combination \u2013 it can't be long before it comes to the UK. Novel nature Coffee fruit \"In the quest to find the next superfood,\" says Saven, \"many food buyers are looking to lesser-known and exotic varieties of fresh produce.\" Step forward coffee fruit (what we know as coffee beans are actually the seeds inside these berries), which is found in products such as the health drink Bai. Insect bars Chapul protein bars have introduced the notion of insect-eating to America. They contain 15% more iron than spinach and as much B12 as salmon, and the insects are disguised by other ingredients including chocolate, coffee, coconut and ginger. Edible wood A Chinese scientist seeking to address future world food shortages has discovered how to make the carbohydrate amylose from wood. It is very complicated and expensive to produce just now, but give it 10 years \u2026 Edible soil Yes, chefs such as Ren\u00e9 Redzepi and Heston Blumenthal have been fashioning delicious foodstuffs into fake soil for years, but we're talking actual earth. Last year, the Tokyo restaurant Ne Quittez Pas introduced a soil-based menu, including dirt and potato soup, dirt risotto with sea bass and dirt ice-cream. According to Yoshihiro Narisawa, a chef from another Tokyo restaurant, soil is rich in umami. This could catch on. \u2022 Follow Amy Fleming on Twitter @amy_fleming.",

    "webTitle": "UK manufacturing tipped for strongest growth in Europe", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's manufacturers will enjoy faster growth than those in Germany or any other western European economy this year from rising demand at home and abroad, according to a report. In its annual survey of companies, manufacturers' organisation EEF found 70% of firms forecast an improvement in the economy in 2014, while just 5% thought conditions would deteriorate. The balance of 65% compares with the sombre outlook at the same time last year when the reading was just 7%. The balance expecting a good year for manufacturing is 52% \u2013 up from zero this time last year. \"Manufacturers are telling us they expect to make a greater contribution to growth, investment and jobs this year,\" said EEF's chief executive Terry Scuoler. The EEF, along with the thinktank Oxford Economics, has forecast that the British manufacturing sector, which accounts for 10% of the economy, will grow 2.7% this year. That puts it ahead of all other western European countries in the thinktank's forecasts. German manufacturing is expected to pick up by 1.6% with France at just 0.7%, level with Spain and just of Greece at 0.4%. Austria and Belgium are also expected to pick up strongly with growth of 2.4% Manufacturers' caution at the start of last year now appears justified however with the sector now forecast by the EEF to have contracted 0.1% during 2013. The sector is still some 9% below its pre-recession level, said the group's chief economist Lee Hopley. \"We are not yet where we want to be,\" she said. \"There is still lots to do.\" But the evidence from the sector was more positive for this year, including signs the pick-up in momentum was broad-based, she said. \"The sectoral difference is not as stark as a year ago. We were quite reliant on the transport sector to do a lot of the heavy lifting for the manufacturing sector over 2013... This year it should be more evenly spread,\" she said. But the manufacturers' group also warned of risks from many sides as the sector strives to make up for the sharp contraction in recent years. The survey of 200 senior executives said uncertainty had become the \"new normal\" after the shocks of recent years when demand dwindled in the UK's key export market, the eurozone. For the year ahead they are worrying about energy prices, being held back by the prolonged hollowing out of the UK's supply base and pressure for pay rises as skills shortages continue to bite. The survey also suggested business investment will finally start to grow again this year. Some 60% of companies said they planned to invest moderately or significantly in the UK. Signs that large companies are ready to start spending some of the cash piles they have been sitting on while smaller firms are prepared to borrow to expand reflect a brighter outlook for sales. Two-thirds of companies expect domestic sales to increase and, 55% of companies expect their exports to increase. The Middle East stands out as an increasingly favoured market for UK manufacturers while they are also more upbeat about the eurozone. Despite the generally positive outlook painted by the survey and other recent indicators from the sector, the EEF said three quarters of manufacturers believe \"economic uncertainty is the new norm\". Manufacturers' general optimism was echoed in a separate report suggesting Britain's biggest companies plan to increase investment and hire more workers in 2014. The latest poll of 122 chief financial officers by consultants Deloitte also found almost half of respondents \u2013 49% \u2013 said Bank of England governor Mark Carney's policies had boosted confidence in the UK's economic outlook. Just 3% said confidence had been dented and the rest saw no effect. Companies' appetite for risk was the highest since the quarterly survey started six years ago and 70% of those surveyed said they expect businesses to increase hiring in 2014.

      "body": "<p>Britain's manufacturers will enjoy faster growth than those in Germany or any other western European economy this year from rising demand at home and abroad, according to a report.</p> <p>In its annual survey of companies, manufacturers' organisation EEF found 70% of firms forecast an improvement in the economy in 2014, while just 5% thought conditions would deteriorate. The balance of 65% compares with the sombre outlook at the same time last year when the reading was just 7%.</p> <p>The balance expecting a good year for manufacturing is 52% \u2013 up from zero this time last year.</p> <p>\"Manufacturers are telling us they expect to make a greater contribution to growth, investment and jobs this year,\" said EEF's chief executive Terry Scuoler.</p> <p>The EEF, along with the thinktank Oxford Economics, has forecast that the British manufacturing sector, which accounts for 10% of the economy, will grow 2.7% this year. That puts it ahead of all other western European countries in the thinktank's forecasts. German manufacturing is expected to pick up by 1.6% with France at just 0.7%, level with Spain and just of Greece at 0.4%.</p> <p>Austria and Belgium are also expected to pick up strongly with growth of 2.4%</p> <p>Manufacturers' caution at the start of last year now appears justified however with the sector now forecast by the EEF to have contracted 0.1% during 2013. The sector is still some 9% below its pre-recession level, said the group's chief economist Lee Hopley. \"We are not yet where we want to be,\" she said. \"There is still lots to do.\"</p> <p>But the evidence from the sector was more positive for this year, including signs the pick-up in momentum was broad-based, she said.</p> <p>\"The sectoral difference is not as stark as a year ago. We were quite reliant on the transport sector to do a lot of the heavy lifting for the manufacturing sector over 2013... This year it should be more evenly spread,\" she said.</p> <p>But the manufacturers' group also warned of risks from many sides as the sector strives to make up for the sharp contraction in recent years. The survey of 200 senior executives said uncertainty had become the \"new normal\" after the shocks of recent years when demand dwindled in the UK's key export market, the eurozone.</p> <p>For the year ahead they are worrying about energy prices, being held back by the prolonged hollowing out of the UK's supply base and pressure for pay rises as skills shortages continue to bite.</p> <p>The survey also suggested business investment will finally start to grow again this year.</p> <p>Some 60% of companies said they planned to invest moderately or significantly in the UK. Signs that large companies are ready to start spending some of the cash piles they have been sitting on while smaller firms are prepared to borrow to expand reflect a brighter outlook for sales. Two-thirds of companies expect domestic sales to increase and, 55% of companies expect their exports to increase. The Middle East stands out as an increasingly favoured market for UK manufacturers while they are also more upbeat about the eurozone.</p> <p>Despite the generally positive outlook painted by the survey and other recent indicators from the sector, the EEF said three quarters of manufacturers believe \"economic uncertainty is the new norm\".</p> <p>Manufacturers' general optimism was echoed in a separate report suggesting Britain's biggest companies plan to increase investment and hire more workers in 2014.</p> <p>The latest poll of 122 chief financial officers by consultants Deloitte also found almost half of respondents \u2013 49% \u2013 said Bank of England governor Mark Carney's policies had boosted confidence in the UK's economic outlook. Just 3% said confidence had been dented and the rest saw no effect.</p> <p>Companies' appetite for risk was the highest since the quarterly survey started six years ago and 70% of those surveyed said they expect businesses to increase hiring in 2014.</p> <p>Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said the survey showed finance chief were starting 2014 \"in buoyant mood with a focus on expansion, investment and hiring.\". This bodes well for the broad-based recovery policymakers hope to see in 2014.\"</p> <p>\"Large corporates have good access to capital and CFOs are more positive about financing their business with equity and bonds than at any time in the last six years. But in a sign that banks are lending once again CFOs rate bank lending as the most attractive form of finance for their business for the first time since 2008.\"</p>",
