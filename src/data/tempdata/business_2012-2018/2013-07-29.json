    "webTitle": "Heatwave pushes UK retail sales to July high", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The balmy summer weather helped to give the high street a boost as customers enjoyed shopping in air-conditioned shopping centres for barbecue and summer essentials, with UK retail sales reaching a six-month high in July. As consumers rushed to replace their winter gear with items more appropriate for a heatwave, clothing and footwear sales rose at the fastest pace \u2013 according to a survey of 60 major retailers by the business group the CBI \u2013 in what is likely to be seen as a positive indicator for an apparently recovering economy. Richard Lowe, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays, said: \"The UK's first heatwave in seven years boosted high-street sales as consumers stocked up on flip-flops and sunscreen. Even more reluctant shoppers were encouraged by sales and promotions.\" The survey also found that department stores \u2013 which include general retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer as well as traditional outlets such as John Lewis \u2013 had enjoyed their strongest surge in sales for 30 years. The figure is at odds with John Lewis's own figures, reported on Friday, which revealed declining sales during the hot weather as shoppers have been less keen on buying homewares and have preferred parks and gardens to shopping centres. The chain also blamed the sporting success of Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and England's cricketers in the Ashes series for keeping shoppers away. Andy Street, managing director, described July trading as \"challenging\" last week, when the company revealed a 1.2% drop in sales in the week to 20 July. The retailers surveyed by the CBI were more upbeat, with 43% saying sales were higher in July compared with a year earlier, while 26% said they were lower. The resulting balance of +17% was the highest since January, and the first rise in five months. The balance of department stores reporting a rise in sales was +98%, the highest since the survey began in 1983. The figures suggest that clothing retailers, which had mostly started their end-of-season sales when the warm weather hit, have been able to offer smaller discounts to clear their stock than during last year's miserable summer. Supermarkets have also been enjoying strong trading as the nation stocks up on barbecue essentials, fruit, salad and suncream. John Lewis's sister company, Waitrose, for example, saw sales jump 11.8% earlier this month, boosted by demand for barbecue and picnic food and accessories. The good news caused by the longest period of warm weather since 2006 was not widespread, however, with the CBI's distributive trades survey showing that sales of furniture and carpets and some specialist food and drinks categories fell in July. Although sales volumes were ahead of January, they remain below average for the time of year. \"The feelgood factor from the heatwave and early summer sales has helped boost high street sales, after a very weak start to the year, said Stephen Gifford, the CBI's director of economics. \"A return to even modest spending is welcome news, but the bottom line is that confidence will not bounce back fully until family finances improve significantly.\" Gifford played down suggestions that the birth of Prince George of Cambridge would have a positive impact on sales, but said continued warm weather and price discounting were likely to drive retail growth in August. Of those retailers surveyed, 39% expected sales to rise next month compared with a year earlier, while 29% predicted a fall. The positive retail sales figures have fuelled expectations that the economy got off to a reasonable start in the third quarter, after official figures last week showed gross domestic product increased by 0.6% between April and June.",

Although sales volumes were ahead of January, they remain below average for the time of year.</p> <p>\"The feelgood factor from the heatwave and early summer sales has helped boost high street sales, after a very weak start to the year, said Stephen Gifford, the CBI's director of economics.</p> <p>\"A return to even modest spending is welcome news, but the bottom line is that confidence will not bounce back fully until family finances improve significantly.\"</p> <p>Gifford played down suggestions that the birth of Prince George of Cambridge would have a positive impact on sales, but said continued warm weather and price discounting were likely to drive retail growth in August.</p> <p>Of those retailers surveyed, 39% expected sales to rise next month compared with a year earlier, while 29% predicted a fall.</p> <p>The positive retail sales figures have fuelled expectations that the economy got off to a reasonable start in the third quarter, after official figures last week showed gross domestic product increased by 0.6% between April and June.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pressure is mounting on Mike Ashley and his Sports Direct empire over its use of zero-hours contracts for part-time employees as the Unite trade union demanded a meeting with the billionaire businessman. Politicians, campaigners and charities called on the UK's biggest sports retailer to change its policy on using the controversial contracts for 90% of its workforce. Sports Direct's 20,000 part-time employees \u2013 all on zero-hours contracts \u2013 make up one in 10 of the total number of workers on such contracts across the UK, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. However, organisations investigating the impact of the contracts claim the revelations show their use is far more widespread than indicated by the ONS. James Plunkett, director of policy at the Resolution Foundation, said: \"These new revelations show again that no one really knows how many workers are on zero-hours contracts \u2013 every official estimate seems to have drastically understated the scale of the issue. While it seems to us too early to ban zero-hours contracts, the case for reform is clear.\" Business secretary Vince Cable also voiced concern, as his department undertakes a review of such contracts, with officials reporting back later this year. He said: \"Since 2005 there has been a rise in the use of zero-hours contracts. There has been anecdotal evidence of abuse by certain employers \u2013 including in the public sector \u2013 of some vulnerable workers at the margins of the labour market. \"While it's important our workforce remains flexible, it is equally important that it is treated fairly. This is why I have asked my officials to undertake some work over the summer to better understand how this type of contract is working in practice today.\" Sports Direct has been heavily criticised for using the contracts, which do not give workers set hours or shifts, and give them no holiday or sick leave. Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons said they do not use zero-hours contracts \u2013 as did Next. Another major retail employer, Arcadia \u2013 the parent company of Topshop, BHS, Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Evans, Wallis and Miss Selfridge \u2013 said it stopped offering zero-hours contracts in 2005 and offered fixed-hours contracts to those still on them. Annmarie Kilcline, a regional secretary at Unite, the only recognised union at Sports Direct, said she had written to Ashley demanding a meeting. She said: \"We hope Mike Ashley will sit down with Unite to discuss how the treatment of workers at Sports Direct can be improved, after they have made the business such a success.\" Meanwhile, thousands of campaigners at pressure group 38 Degrees have written to Sports Direct calling on it to offer fixed-hours contracts to workers and shoppers have taken to Twitter demanding a boycott. Ian Murray, shadow business minister for employment relations, called on Sports Direct to address the issues raised and questioned their silence. He said: \"It's pretty shocking. We understand that zero-hours contracts have built up because of the flexibility, but to be used across an entire retail establishment is unacceptable. \"This is something Sports Direct should engage with. There is unanimous agreement across all parties that this is unfair for some. It should be there to assist the workforce and not to be abused. The fact they are not commenting is very telling.\" The government has promised a review over the summer, conducted by three officials from the Department for Business Innovation and Skills. However, there are fears that not enough resources are available. Plunkett added: \"It's vital that the government review of the issue is backed by enough resources and political will to get to the root of the problem.\" Sports Direct declined to comment.",

Europe's biggest ice-cream producer, Yorkshire's R&amp;R Ice Cream, which makes own-label ice-cream for supermarkets as well as Cadbury and Nestl\u00e9 products, said production at its factories last week had more than doubled from a month before. \"We've had record-breaking sales two weeks in a row,\" said Mike Fraine, R&amp;R's sales director for the UK and Ireland. He said the company had taken on between 20% and 25% more staff than last year, and reported a 300% rise in sales. Although retailers typically hold several weeks' stock of ice-cream in warehouses in preparation for sudden spikes in demand, some popular brands and lines are growing scarce. \"As fast as we are supplying ice creams, retailers are running out,\" one supplier told the industry trade journal The Grocer. \"In some stores I've been to, the freezer cabinets look like something out of Beirut.\" The British conglomerate Unilever, which makes popular brands including Walls and Ben &amp; Jerry's, said it had been forced to draw on its European factories to keep up with UK demand. Carmarthenshire-based Frank's, which delivers to most of the major supermarkets as well as public institutions, said sales had doubled. \"Staff are working overtime and weekends to keep up with demand,\" said the sales director Maria Dallvalle. \"This summer weather has been long awaited.\" Sales of ice lollies have been particularly strong. Retailers sold \u00a38.2m worth more lollies in the week to 13 July compared with the same week last year, a 293% improvement. Sorbet sales were up 101% and ice-cream up 90%, according to the retail analysts IRI. That has helped boost the total value of the market in desserts from the freezer, as lollies are typically 16% more expensive per kilogram than ice-creams. With strong demand, the price of lollies has risen year on year while ice-cream prices are down. Although the weather has now cooled a little, Tesco neverthless expects to sell 150% more lollies in the last two weeks of July compared with the same period last year. But despite the heat-induced sales spike, the market research specialist Mintel said underlying diet concerns and the Met Office's long-term prediction of rainy summers in years to come meant long-term demand for ice-cream was on a downward trend and would fall by 9% by 2017. Sales of \"sticks\" such as lollies, Cornettos or 99 Flakes have fallen by nearly a third in the past three years amid cool, damp summers. Tim Eales, director of strategic insight at IRI, said it was too early to tell whether this year's ice-cream and lolly boom would turn the market around, but it was clear that the last three years of poor weather had suppressed sales. \"We have seen a massive change, more than you might expect to see because of the weather,\" he said. \"When you're deprived of sunshine for a while and you suddenly get it, people go mad for it and they are striking while the sun is hot. There is an over-reaction because people want to get outside and enjoy the sunshine.\"",

      "bodyText": "In May this year, a huge company listed on the London Stock Exchange found itself in the midst of controversy about a prison it runs for the government \u2013 Thameside, a newly built jail next to Belmarsh, in south-east London. A report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate found that 60% of its inmates were locked up all day, and there were only \"vague plans to restore the prison to normality\". The prison campaign group the Howard League for Penal Reform talked about conditions that were \"truly alarming\". Two months later, the same company was the subject of a high- profile report published by the House Of Commons public accounts committee, prompted by the work of Guardian journalist Felicity Lawrence. This time, attention was focused on how it was managing out-of-hours GP services in Cornwall, and massive failings that had first surfaced two years before. Again, the verdict was damning: data had been falsified, national standards had not been met, there was a culture of \"lying and cheating\", and the service offered to the public was simply \"not good enough\". Three weeks ago, there came grimmer news. Thanks to its contracts for tagging offenders, the company was now the focus of panic at the Ministry of Justice, where it had been discovered that it was one of two contractors that had somehow overcharged the government for its services, possibly by as much as \u00a350m; there were suggestions that one in six of the tags that the state had paid for did not actually exist. How this happened is still unclear, but justice secretary Chris Grayling has said the allegations represent something \"wholly indefensible and unacceptable\". The firm that links these three stories together is Serco. Its range of activities, here and abroad, is truly mind-boggling, taking in no end of things that were once done by the state, but are now outsourced to private companies. Amazingly, its contracts with government are subject to what's known as \"commercial confidentiality\" and as a private firm it's not open to Freedom of Information requests, so looking into the details of what it does is fraught with difficulty. But the basic facts are plain enough. As well as five British prisons and the tags attached to over 8,000 English and Welsh offenders, Serco sees to two immigration removal centres, at Colnbrook near Heathrow, and Yarl's Wood in Bedfordshire. You'll also see its logo on the Docklands Light Railway and Woolwich ferry, and is a partner in both Liverpool's Merseyrail network, and the Northern Rail franchise, which sees to trains that run in a huge area between the North Midlands and English-Scottish border. Serco runs school inspections in parts of England, speed cameras all over the UK, and the National Nuclear Laboratory, based at the Sellafield site in Cumbria. It also holds the contracts for the management of the UK's ballistic missile early warning system on the Yorkshire moors, the running of the Manchester Aquatics Centre, and London's \"Boris bikes\". As evidenced by the story of how it handled out-of-hours care in Cornwall, it is also an increasingly big player in a health service that is being privatised at speed, in the face of surprisingly little public opposition: among its array of NHS contracts is a new role seeing to \"community health services\" in Suffolk, which involves 1,030 employees. The company is also set to bid for an even bigger healthcare contract in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough: the NHS's single-biggest privatisation \u2013 or, if you prefer, \"outsourcing\" \u2013 to date, which could be worth over \u00a31bn. But even this is only a fraction of the story. Among their scores of roles across the planet, Serco is responsible for air traffic control in the United Arab Emirates, parking-meter services in Chicago, driving tests in Ontario, and an immigration detention centre on Christmas Island, run on behalf of those well-known friends of overseas visitors the Australian government. In the US, the company has just been awarded a controversial $1.25bn contract by that country's Department of Health. All told, its operations suggest some real-life version of the fantastical mega-corporations that have long been invented by fiction writers; a more benign version of the Tyrell Corporation from Blade Runner, say, or one of those creations from James Bond movies whose name always seems to end with the word \"industries\". The strangest thing, though, is the gap between Serco's size and how little the public knows about it. Not for nothing does so much coverage of its work include the sentence \"the biggest company you've never heard of\". I first heard Serco's name about eight years ago, when I was just starting to understand the amazing growth of what are now called \"public service companies\". Once I started looking, their logos were everywhere, suggesting a shadow state that has since grown ever-bigger. Their names seemed anonymously stylised, in keeping with the sense that they seemed both omnipresent, and barely known: Interserve, Sodexo, Capita, the Compass Group. Serco is among the biggest of them all. At the last count, its annual pre-tax profits were up 27%, at \u00a3302m. In 2012 alone, its British workforce grew by 10,000, to 53,000 people (tellingly, as many as 90% of them are said to be former civil servant employees). In terms of employees, that makes it more than twice as large as the BBC, and around 20% bigger than Philip Green's Arcadia group. A very significant player, in other words, and one that has come a long way since its foundation 1929, when it was a branch of the American RCA corporation called RCA Services Ltd, involved in the then booming UK cinema industry. It was renamed Serco in 1987, after a management buy-out, and floated on the stock exchange the following year. In the 25 subsequent years, during which the UK has grown ever-fouder of outsourcing and privatisation, Serco has grown at an amazing rate. The current chief executive of the global Serco Group is 49-year-old Chris Hyman, born in Durban, South Africa. His annual remuneration is around \u00a3700,000, plus bonuses; in 2011, the value of his total package rose 18%, to \u00a31.86m (the company's finance director had to slum it at \u00a3948,295). In 2010, Hyman was given a CBE for services to business and charity; he is also an enthusiastic fan of motor racing and an evangelical Christian. Four years ago, he was asked about his company's very low profile, and he said this: \"We had a dilemma \u2013 what do we do with the Serco name. We are proud of it. We thought we needed billboards at airports and places like that, to be seen with Tiger Woods on. But we worked out very quickly that is not what we are meant to do. We are meant to be known by the 5,000 not the five billion. The people who serve the people need to choose who supplies the service. We are delighted when the public knows who we are, but really, we need to be known by the people who make decisions.\" When Serco made its bid to run NHS community-health services in Suffolk \u2013 district nursing, physiotherapy, OT, end-of-life palliative care, wheelchair services \u2013 it reckoned it could do it for \u00a3140m over three years \u2013 \u00a316m less than the existing NHS \"provider\" had managed, which would eventually allow for their standard profit margin of around 6% a year. When it started to become clear that Serco was the frontrunner, there was some opposition, but perhaps not nearly enough. \"Suffolk isn't the most politically active part of the country,\" says one local insider. \"And the staff were very lackadaisical. It was: 'NHS Suffolk wouldn't made a bad decision.' So it was hard to get a campaign going.\" Serco was officially awarded the contract in October 2012, which meant that hundreds of staff would leave the NHS, and become company employees. Within weeks, the company proposed a huge reorganisation, which involved getting rid of one in six jobs. This has since come down to one in seven, two thirds of which will apparently go via natural wastage. In terms of their pay and conditions, the hundreds of people who have been transferred from the NHS to Serco are protected by provisions laid down by the last government, but it is already becoming clear that many new staff are on inferior contracts: as one local source puts it, \"they've got less annual leave, less sick pay \u2026 it's significantly worse.\" Meanwhile, other people are reportedly quitting their jobs, and the service given to patients is said to be getting worse. \"In my team alone, we're 50% down on staffing hours compared with last year,\" says one former NHS worker, who provides home-care to patients who are largely elderly. Thanks to poor morale, she says that the team in which she works has lost around a third of its staff, and she is also having to see to administrative tasks that were previously carried out by someone else: in addition, she claims, support for a new IT regime is \"farcical\". \"We've still got the same number of patients,\" she says, \"so the workload has massively increased.\" As a result, she and her colleagues are having to cut people out of their previous entitlement to treatment at home. \"That completely goes against our ethics,\" she says, \"but that's what we're having to do.\" The NHS is a relatively new area of controversy for Serco, but concerns about their practices run across many other areas. Right now, the controversy over alleged overcharging, focused on both Serco and its fellow tagging- contractor G4S, seems to have only just begun. When the news was made public, 8% was wiped off Serco's share price. The Cabinet Office has announced a review \"into government-held G4S and Serco contracts to ensure that contracts are well-managed and in good order\", which will report in the autumn. Work for the British government accounts for 40% of Serco's revenues; to quote from the Daily Telegraph. \"Without Serco, Britain would struggle to go to war\". That gives you some idea of how deeply its work penetrates the state, and how unthinkable any kind of corporate crisis would be. Margaret Hodge, the former Labour minister who now chairs the public accounts committee, clearly thinks that all these stories point to huge issues. She talks about \"the inability of government to contract-out in a way that protects the taxpayer's interest.\" The Cornwall out-of-hours story, she tells me, was reducible to \"an absurd situation where you had a company seemingly lying about what it was doing, but there was nothing in the contract that could allow you to terminate it \u2013 indeed, they still appeared to be eligible for their bonus payments. It's quite extraordinary.\" There are even bigger issues at stake, though. \"There's also the inability of the public sector to monitor effectively,\" she says. \"The Cornwall story came to light because of a Guardian journalist and a whole load of whistleblowers. Which is nuts: a crazy way for the public sector holding to account the private sector when it's delivering public services.\" Even her committee, she says, cannot break through a great wall of commercial confidentiality, and look at what the companies delivering pubic services are up to \u2013 not just in terms of their bids for public services and contracts with government, but such vital matters as their costs, and the profits they make from particular jobs. Does she feel any guilt about the fact that companies such as Serco made their decisive breakthrough into public services when Labour was in power? There's a murmur of agreement. \"I think we were as bad at managing this diversity of providers,\" she says. \"But one of the things that gets me with this government is that they should have learned from our mistakes. What is becoming really clear to me \u2026 is that the Sercos, the A4s, the G4Ss, the Capitas \u2013 they're good at winning contracts, but too often, they're bad at running services.\" And what of the incredible range of what Serco actually does, from school inspections to Boris bikes? \"Interestingly, we are looking at this. The National Audit Office is doing work around the development of quasi-monopoly private providers, which is the world we're moving into. We don't really understand the size of their empires. We've got to start getting hold of this. It's a new phenomenon.\" Once I'd spoken to Hodge, I got hold of one of Serco's \"media relations team\", and arranged to send him a few questions. On the subject of the out-of-hours GP fiasco in Cornwall, he quoted a response from the doctor in charge of their set-up. \"It's really important that the local people in Cornwall do not lose confidence in this essential urgent care service,\" he said. \"It is a valued part of the local NHS and we are proud of our professional team who provide it.\" A wider statement said the company had taken \"swift and decisive action to put the situation right and apologised to the people of Cornwall\", and made \"a goodwill gesture to repay the bonus made [sic] to us in 2012, which we were under no obligation to do.\" All told, I was assured, their service \"delivers a high standard against the national quality requirements\". On the allegations about what has happened since Serco took over community healthcare in Suffolk, and the claim that any new starters aside from clinical staff are on inferior terms and conditions, the same spokesperson said that such employees are \"offered contracts in line with Serco standard terms and conditions which are market comparable\". He denied that anyone had been cut out of treatment at home, said that the company had \"recently realigned our clinical teams across Suffolk according to the needs of the areas in which they deliver care\" and claimed that new IT systems are being implemented \"slowly and carefully\". The controversy surrounding Thameside prison, they said, had been followed by \"a series of initiatives\" including a \"gangs strategy\", and measures to help prisoners with mental-health issues. Some people were now allowed to be outside their cells \"during the core part of the day\", and in August, Serco anticipated that this would be extended. As for the ongoing story about overcharging for their tagging contract with the Ministry of Justice, Serco said this: \"We are working with our customer, the Ministry of Justice [on] this matter so there is very little we can add at this stage.\" I was also directed to a statement from Chris Hyman, which said the company \"will not tolerate poor practice and behaviour and wherever it is found we will put it right\", and reminded that justice secretary Chris Grayling has said he so far has \"no information to confirm dishonesty had taken place\" on the part of either Serco or G4S. There was one last question, concerning the amazing spread of what Serco sees to, from parking meters, through nuclear early warning systems, to an expanding share of the NHS. Is there any limit to the fields they work in? \"We operate in a range of markets and geographies,\" went its answer, \"which means we are well placed to bring a wide range of experiences and knowledge to help customers with the challenges that they face.\" That'll be a no, then.",

Their names seemed anonymously stylised, in keeping with the sense that they seemed both omnipresent, and barely known: Interserve, Sodexo, Capita, the Compass Group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-413917309\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/7/29/1375114782868/A-Serco-clinic-in-Truro-C-010.jpg\" alt=\"A Serco clinic in Truro, Cornwall.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Serco clinic in Truro, Cornwall. Photograph: Jim Wileman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Serco is among the biggest of them all. At the last count, its annual pre-tax profits were up 27%, at \u00a3302m. In 2012 alone, its British workforce grew by 10,000, to 53,000 people (tellingly, as many as 90% of them are said to be <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/supportservices/6096223/Meet-Serco-the-company-running-the-country.html\" title=\"\">former civil servant employees</a>). In terms of employees, that makes it more than twice as large as the BBC, and around 20% bigger than Philip Green's Arcadia group. A very significant player, in other words, and one that has come a long way since its foundation 1929, when it was a branch of the American RCA corporation called RCA Services Ltd, involved in the then booming UK cinema industry. It was renamed Serco in 1987, after a management buy-out, and floated on the stock exchange the following year. In the 25 subsequent years, during which the UK has grown ever-fouder of outsourcing and privatisation, Serco has grown at an amazing rate.</p> <p>The current chief executive of the global Serco Group is 49-year-old Chris Hyman, born in Durban, South Africa. His annual remuneration is around \u00a3700,000, plus bonuses; in 2011, the value of his total package rose 18%, to \u00a31.86m (the company's finance director had to slum it at \u00a3948,295).</p> <p>In 2010, Hyman was given a CBE for services to business and charity; he is also an enthusiastic fan of motor racing and an evangelical Christian. Four years ago, he was asked about his company's very low profile, and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/supportservices/6096223/Meet-Serco-the-company-running-the-country.html\" title=\"\">he said this</a>: \"We had a dilemma \u2013 what do we do with the Serco name. We are proud of it. We thought we needed billboards at airports and places like that, to be seen with Tiger Woods on. But we worked out very quickly that is not what we are meant to do. We are meant to be known by the 5,000 not the five billion. The people who serve the people need to choose who supplies the service. We are delighted when the public knows who we are, but really, we need to be known by the people who make decisions.\"</p> <p>When Serco made its bid to run NHS community-health services in Suffolk \u2013 district nursing, physiotherapy, OT, end-of-life palliative care, wheelchair services \u2013 it reckoned it could do it for \u00a3140m over three years \u2013 \u00a316m less than the existing NHS \"provider\" had managed, which would eventually allow for their standard profit margin of around 6% a year. When it started to become clear that Serco was the frontrunner, there was some opposition, but perhaps not nearly enough. \"Suffolk isn't the most politically active part of the country,\" says one local insider. \"And the staff were very lackadaisical. It was: 'NHS Suffolk wouldn't made a bad decision.' So it was hard to get a campaign going.\"</p> <p>Serco was officially awarded the contract in October 2012, which meant that hundreds of staff would leave the NHS, and become company employees. Within weeks, the company proposed a huge reorganisation, which involved getting rid of one in six jobs. This has since come down to one in seven, two thirds of which will apparently go via natural wastage. In terms of their pay and conditions, the hundreds of people who have been transferred from the NHS to Serco are protected by provisions laid down by the last government, but it is already becoming clear that many new staff are on inferior contracts: as one local source puts it, \"they've got less annual leave, less sick pay \u2026 it's significantly worse.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, other people are reportedly quitting their jobs, and the service given to patients is said to be getting worse. \"In my team alone, we're 50% down on staffing hours compared with last year,\" says one former NHS worker, who provides home-care to patients who are largely elderly. Thanks to poor morale, she says that the team in which she works has lost around a third of its staff, and she is also having to see to administrative tasks that were previously carried out by someone else: in addition, she claims, support for a new IT regime is \"farcical\".</p> <p>\"We've still got the same number of patients,\" she says, \"so the workload has massively increased.\" As a result, she and her colleagues are having to cut people out of their previous entitlement to treatment at home. \"That completely goes against our ethics,\" she says, \"but that's what we're having to do.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-413917310\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/7/29/1375114891484/Phosphate-Hill-Detention--010.jpg\" alt=\"Phosphate Hill Detention Centre in Australia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phosphate Hill Detention Centre in Australia. Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The NHS is a relatively new area of controversy for Serco, but concerns about their practices run across many other areas. Right now, the controversy over alleged overcharging, focused on both Serco and its fellow tagging- contractor G4S, seems to have only just begun. When the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2013/jul/11/g4s-serco-allegations-serious-fraud-office\" title=\"\">news was made public</a>, 8% was wiped off Serco's share price. The Cabinet Office has announced a review \"into government-held G4S and Serco contracts to ensure that contracts are well-managed and in good order\", which will report in the autumn. Work for the British government accounts for 40% of Serco's revenues; to quote from the Daily Telegraph. \"Without Serco, Britain would struggle to go to war\". That gives you some idea of how deeply its work penetrates the state, and how unthinkable any kind of corporate crisis would be.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaret-hodge\" title=\"\">Margaret Hodge</a>, the former Labour minister who now chairs the public accounts committee, clearly thinks that all these stories point to huge issues. She talks about \"the inability of government to contract-out in a way that protects the taxpayer's interest.\" The Cornwall out-of-hours story, she tells me, was reducible to \"an absurd situation where you had a company seemingly lying about what it was doing, but there was nothing in the contract that could allow you to terminate it \u2013 indeed, they still appeared to be eligible for their bonus payments. It's quite extraordinary.\"</p> <p>There are even bigger issues at stake, though. \"There's also the inability of the public sector to monitor effectively,\" she says. \"The Cornwall story came to light because of a Guardian journalist and a whole load of whistleblowers. Which is nuts: a crazy way for the public sector holding to account the private sector when it's delivering public services.\" Even her committee, she says, cannot break through a great wall of commercial confidentiality, and look at what the companies delivering pubic services are up to \u2013 not just in terms of their bids for public services and contracts with government, but such vital matters as their costs, and the profits they make from particular jobs.</p> <p>Does she feel any guilt about the fact that companies such as Serco made their decisive breakthrough into public services when Labour was in power? There's a murmur of agreement. \"I think we were as bad at managing this diversity of providers,\" she says. \"But one of the things that gets me with this government is that they should have learned from our mistakes. What is becoming really clear to me \u2026 is that the Sercos, the A4s, the G4Ss, the Capitas \u2013 they're good at winning contracts, but too often, they're bad at running services.\"</p> <p>And what of the incredible range of what Serco actually does, from school inspections to Boris bikes? \"Interestingly, we are looking at this. The National Audit Office is doing work around the development of quasi-monopoly private providers, which is the world we're moving into. We don't really understand the size of their empires. We've got to start getting hold of this. It's a new phenomenon.\"</p> <p>Once I'd spoken to Hodge, I got hold of one of Serco's \"media relations team\", and arranged to send him a few questions. On the subject of the out-of-hours GP fiasco in Cornwall, he quoted a response from the doctor in charge of their set-up. \"It's really important that the local people in Cornwall do not lose confidence in this essential urgent care service,\" he said. \"It is a valued part of the local NHS and we are proud of our professional team who provide it.\" A wider statement said the company had taken \"swift and decisive action to put the situation right and apologised to the people of Cornwall\", and made \"a goodwill gesture to repay the bonus made [sic] to us in 2012, which we were under no obligation to do.\" All told, I was assured, their service \"delivers a high standard against the national quality requirements\".</p> <p>On the allegations about what has happened since Serco took over community healthcare in Suffolk, and the claim that any new starters aside from clinical staff are on inferior terms and conditions, the same spokesperson said that such employees are \"offered contracts in line with Serco standard terms and conditions which are market comparable\". He denied that anyone had been cut out of treatment at home, said that the company had \"recently realigned our&#xa0;clinical teams across Suffolk according to the needs of the areas in which they deliver care\" and claimed that new IT systems are being implemented \"slowly and carefully\".</p> <p>The controversy surrounding Thameside prison, they said, had been followed by \"a series of initiatives\" including a \"gangs strategy\", and measures to help prisoners with mental-health issues. Some people were now allowed to be outside their cells \"during the core part of the day\", and in August, Serco anticipated that this would be extended.</p> <p>As for the ongoing story about overcharging for their tagging contract with the Ministry of Justice, Serco said this: \"We are working with our customer, the Ministry of Justice [on] this matter so there is very little we can add at this stage.\" I was also directed to a statement from Chris Hyman, which said the company \"will not tolerate poor practice and behaviour and wherever it is found we will put it right\", and reminded that justice secretary Chris Grayling has said he so far has \"no information to confirm dishonesty had taken place\" on the part of either Serco or G4S.</p> <p>There was one last question, concerning the amazing spread of what Serco sees to, from parking meters, through nuclear early warning systems, to an expanding share of the NHS. Is there any limit to the fields they work in?</p> <p>\"We operate in a range of markets and geographies,\" went its answer, \"which means we are well placed to bring a wide range of experiences and knowledge to help customers with the challenges that they face.\"</p> <p>That'll be a no, then.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Michigan-based drugs company takes advantage of Ireland's 12.5% corporate tax rate", 
      "body": "<p>US drugmaker Perrigo has agreed to buy Irish biotech firm Elan in an $8.6bn (\u00a35.6bn) deal that will knock millions off the Michigan-based company's tax bill as it takes advantage of the emerald isle's corporate tax rate.</p> <p>Perrigo, which makes over-the-counter medicines and vitamins, said it would make annual savings of more than $150m (\u00a398m) in taxes and operating costs by moving its headquarters to Ireland, where corporation tax is 12.5% compared with the US rate of 35%.</p> <p>Joe Papa, Perrigo chief executive, described the deal as \"financially compelling\" and said it would mean the combined company would pay a corporate tax rate in \"the high teens\".</p> <p>\"We're excited by what it means for the international expansion. We think it's financially compelling and when you put it together with an Irish domicile that has operational tax synergies, we think it's a really compelling story.\"</p> <p>The takeover, which gives Perrigo shareholders 71% of the company to Elan's 29%, shows the appeal of Ireland's ultra-low corporate tax rates, which have attracted hundreds of foreign companies, including tech giants Apple and Google. Ireland's tax system came under the microscope of the US Senate in May when lawmakers accused <a href=\"http://http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/20/apple-accused-tax-avoidance-billions-scheme?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Apple of using subsidiaries</a>, ostensibly based in Ireland, to avoid paying billions to the US Treasury.</p> <p>Perrigo's company headquarters will move to Ireland, although shares in the new company are expected to trade on the New York and Tel Aviv stock exchanges. Perrigo has had a Tel Aviv listing since it acquired Israeli-based Agis industries in 2005.</p> <p>The merger signals a revival of animal spirits in the corporate world after a fallow period for dealmakers following the economic slump. News of the deal helped lift the FTSE 100 in early trading, as investors also digested news of the $35bn (\u00a323bn) mega merger between France's Publicis and America's Omnicom to create the world's largest advertising firm.</p> <p>The Perrigo-Elan tie-up underlines the ease with which companies can acquire a cheaper tax rate. Hundreds of US companies are based in Ireland, where they pay an <a href=\"http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2013/0503/390280-us-corporations-tax/\" title=\"\">average tax rate of 8%</a>, according to a report by the US Congressional Budget Office.

      "bodyText": "US drugmaker Perrigo has agreed to buy Irish biotech firm Elan in an $8.6bn (\u00a35.6bn) deal that will knock millions off the Michigan-based company's tax bill as it takes advantage of the emerald isle's corporate tax rate. Perrigo, which makes over-the-counter medicines and vitamins, said it would make annual savings of more than $150m (\u00a398m) in taxes and operating costs by moving its headquarters to Ireland, where corporation tax is 12.5% compared with the US rate of 35%. Joe Papa, Perrigo chief executive, described the deal as \"financially compelling\" and said it would mean the combined company would pay a corporate tax rate in \"the high teens\". \"We're excited by what it means for the international expansion. We think it's financially compelling and when you put it together with an Irish domicile that has operational tax synergies, we think it's a really compelling story.\" The takeover, which gives Perrigo shareholders 71% of the company to Elan's 29%, shows the appeal of Ireland's ultra-low corporate tax rates, which have attracted hundreds of foreign companies, including tech giants Apple and Google. Ireland's tax system came under the microscope of the US Senate in May when lawmakers accused Apple of using subsidiaries, ostensibly based in Ireland, to avoid paying billions to the US Treasury. Perrigo's company headquarters will move to Ireland, although shares in the new company are expected to trade on the New York and Tel Aviv stock exchanges. Perrigo has had a Tel Aviv listing since it acquired Israeli-based Agis industries in 2005. The merger signals a revival of animal spirits in the corporate world after a fallow period for dealmakers following the economic slump. News of the deal helped lift the FTSE 100 in early trading, as investors also digested news of the $35bn (\u00a323bn) mega merger between France's Publicis and America's Omnicom to create the world's largest advertising firm. The Perrigo-Elan tie-up underlines the ease with which companies can acquire a cheaper tax rate. Hundreds of US companies are based in Ireland, where they pay an average tax rate of 8%, according to a report by the US Congressional Budget Office. Perrigo is only the latest to move across the Atlantic, following US pharmaceutical company Actavis, which announced in May that it was buying Dublin-based Warner Chilcott in a $8.5bn (\u00a35.6bn) deal that will see the company based in Dublin. Since it was founded in 1887 by a general store entrepreneur, who sent travelling salesman bearing patent medicines across the American midwest, Perrigo has grown into a global company with 9,500 employees that develops, makes and distributes generic medicines, as well as over-the-counter remedies, diet pills and infant formula. If the takeover is approved by regulators, Perrigo will reap the benefits of Elan's blockbuster drug Tysabri, seen as one of the most effective treatments for multiple sclerosis. Elan, a co-inventor of the drug, earns 12% royalties on Tysabri's global sales, which were worth $1.6bn in 2012 and are expected to grow rapidly, as the drug is taken up in new countries and to treat other diseases. Tysabri is Elan's main product, after the company sold off almost all of its drugs after the high-profile failure of experimental Alzheimer's drug bapineuzumab, which never lived up to hopes it would fight progression of the debilitating brain disease. The tie-up with Perrigo brings an end to a tumultuous period for Elan, which has fought off three hostile takeover bids from New York-based Royalty Pharma. After the flop of its latest bid that valued Elan at $6.7bn, Royalty Pharma announced it was giving up its fight to acquire the company. Perrigo will pay Elan shareholders $6.25 in cash and 0.076 of the new Perrigo company's stock, per share, in a deal that Elan chairman Robert Ingram described as \"an excellent transaction\". Elan shares are valued at $16.50 \u2013 a premium of 10% on their closing price on 26 July. Barclays and HSBC have put up $4.35bn in bridging capital to underwrite the deal.",

    "webTitle": "Eurozone crisis: Italian PM blasts handling of Greek crisis in show of solidarity - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Enrico Letta's visit to Greece, and his strong condemnation of the mistakes made over its bailout programme, are an important signal of solidarity among Southern European states as autumn approaches. So explains our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, who analyses the situation here: Like all politics the Italian prime minister\u2019s trip to Greece has been perfectly choreographed. Ten days after the one-day visit to Athens of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble, and ten days before the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 own trip to Washington, Enrico Letta\u2019a two-day visit has achieved what it was meant to do: display, as never before, that in Europe\u2019s crisis-hit south, solidarity is alive and well. If the US president Barack Obama thought basket case Greece was out on a limb, he will now have to think again. Samaras, a traditional conservative, could not have written such endorsement. Left-wing leader Letta came promising encouragement for Athens - \u201cand to say there is a Europe that wants to help Greece\u201d - and he handed it out in dollops. Not since the eruption of the debt crisis almost four years ago, has a visiting politician delivered such a withering attack on the policies of austerity. Ahead of the German elections in late September, the Greek prime minister was given the perfect opportunity to ram home the message that austerity-inducing recession is not only not working, it needs to be replaced by policies of growth. That Greece is far from the \u201csuccess story\u201d the two-party governing coalition has trumpeted in recent months, was underscored by Schauble himself when he announced Sunday that \u201cGreece has in no way crossed the mountain.\u201d More than ever, it needed to apply painful cuts, not least in the public sector where 12,500 will be added to the record numbers of unemployed by the end of the year. And with today\u2019s European Commission report (12.49pm) predicting yet more shrinkage in an economy that has contracted by nearly 25 % since 2009, far from being on the road to recovery, Athens is headed for a very rough ride. As Letta pointed out, in such unfettered fashion today, policies will have to change drastically and stop being an end in themselves if Europe and Greece are ever to turn around. And that's a good moment to stop. \u2022 Details of Letta's stirring attack on eurozone failings are here \u2022 Highlights of his press conference with Antonis Samaras start here \u2022 Details of Wolfgang Schauble's comments on Greece start here \u2022 Coverage of the latest review of Greece's bailout programme start here And there's various other breaking news and suchlike scattered through the blog..... I'll be back tomorrow for more of the same. Until then, thanks, and good night.... A dreary day in Europe's financial markets has ended with the FTSE 100 little changed, but losses in Italy after Moody's downgraded three banks late on Friday. Here's the closing prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: up 5 points at 6560, + 0.08% \u2022 German DAX: up 6 points at 8251, +0.08% \u2022 French CAC: down 4 points at 3964, -0.1% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 22 points at 8376, +0.27% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 145 points at 16275, -0.89% Here's the biggest fallers in Milan: Not a good day for banks generally, in fact, with Barclays closing 3.5% lower on anticipation of a big rights issue being announced tomorrow morning (see 10.30am for earlier details). In New York the Dow Jones industrial average is off about 60 points, a fall of 0.4%. Traders seem to be waiting for big news later in the week, including central bank meetings in the UK, US and Eurozone. IG's Chris Beauchamp commented: Traders have started this action-packed week with a very cautious session, with major indices in the UK and Europe ceding early gains and Wall Street kicking off the week in the red. It still feels as if we are stuck in a fairly narrow trading range, but if anything can break us out of this it will be the week ahead, where earnings, economic data and central bank meetings will come thick and fast. Today is just the calm before the storm. Over in America, Fed chair Ben Bernanke faces the prospect of testifying in a court case over the bailout of AIG in the early days of the financial crisis. Reuters has the story: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke should testify in the lawsuit by American International Group Inc's (AIG) former chief Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg against the United States over the insurer's 2008 bailout, a judge ruled on Monday. Judge Thomas Wheeler of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims rejected the government's effort to keep Bernanke from being deposed, saying the Fed chairman was a \"central figure\" in the decision to bail out AIG. \"Indeed, the court cannot fathom having to decide this multi-billion dollar claim without the testimony of such a key government decision maker,\" Wheeler wrote. \"These facts constitute 'extraordinary circumstances' for the taking of Mr. Bernanke's deposition.\" Greenberg's Starr International Co, which once had a 12% stake in AIG, is suing over the government's taking of a 79.9% stake in the insurer in September 2008 and a separate 1-for-20 reverse stock split in June 2009. Not how Bernanke planned spending his last few months at the Fed, I imagine... Greece's prime minister issued a plea for fellow eurozone leaders to drag the region back to growth, during his press conference with Enrico Letta. Asociated Press flags up that Antonis Samaras said Greece's recession was \"worsening problems that we must solve and complicating reforms which we must complete.\" He said a Greek recovery would not be possible unless the 17-country eurozone bloc itself emerges from recession. Recent data has suggested that the eurozone's recession may end in the current quarter, but record unemployment levels and tight bank lending means the recovery could be slow... Italy's prime minister, Enrico Letta, has delivered a deeply critical assessment of the way Greece's financial crisis has been handled by Europe and the International Monetary Fund. Letta blasted the austerity measures imposed on Athens for deepening the crisis and making its unemployment crisis worse, during his two-day visit to the country. During today's press conference with Greece's Antonis Samaras, Letta declared: There is no doubt that serious mistakes were made about Greece by Europe in the past few years. The timing was wrong. The instruments were wrong. The interventions were not made in the right way and at the right time and this worsened the crisis. The crisis would have been different. It would have created less of a financial disaster, it would have led to fewer job losses across Europe if Europe's attitude to Greece had been different at the beginning. (quotes via Reuters) As I flagged up at 11.52am, both leaders said they hoped Europe could turn the corner next year. Letta, though, insisted that the recovery must be based on growth and employment, not simply cuts: These sacrifices are not an end in themselves, they're not the goal, they're the instrument to reach the promised land. A message that should go down well in Italy, as well as Greece... The EC has also tweaked Greece's privatisation targets, following Athens' failure to find a buyer for its national gas network. Today's report showed that the 2013 privatisation target has been cut to \u20ac1.6bn, from \u20ac2.6bn, reflecting the lack of revenue from the sale of DEPA, which flopped in June. However, Athens isn't off the hook -- 2014's target has been hiked to \u20ac3.5bn, up from \u20ac1.9bn six months ago. The EC didn't hide its exasperation: While progress has been made in preparing for privatisation, the overall speed of the privatisation process remains unsatisfactory. And here's the key chart (from 26 of the report). Today's report (12,.49pm) shows the EC is still confident that the Greek economy will return to growth in 2014. It states that economic indicators for the first six months of 2013 show signs of \"a gradual bottoming out of the decline in economic activity in Greece\". Tourism could play a big role, with pre-bookings up by at least 10%. And the EC is also hoping that the jobs crisis could ease, as \"the contraction in employment is projected to decelerate over the year\". But despite this optimism, inspectors still expect GDP to shrink by 4.2% this year, and only rise by 0.6% in 2014. It then spies growth of 2.9% in 2015 and a positively healthy 3.7% in 2016: The European Commission has declared that Greece's bailout programme is broadly on track, but warned that the fiscal outlook remains highly uncertain. The comments come in the EC's latest quarterly review of the Greek aid package, published online a few minutes ago, which approves its next aid payment. The report explains that Greece is making \"slow\" progress: Important progress has been made on public finances and the recapitalisation of the four core banks has been completed. The legal basis for the new semi-autonomous revenue administration has been created, but perseverance in implementing the ongoing reforms will be key to deliver concrete results in the fight against tax evasion Several important structural reforms have been implemented in the areas of healthcare, the opening of professions, and public financial management. However, far-reaching reforms are still needed in many other areas, including public administration reform, improvements of the business environment, energy and justice. Click below to download it: The Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece \u2013 Third Review July 2013 The first few pages of the report also lists a series of hurdles and problems facing Greece, including: \u2022 Shortfalls, notably in the health sector, that threatened the achievement of the fiscal targets for 2013 and 2014 \u2022 Increasing public revenues and reforming an ineffective revenue administration are key priorities, but there remain concerns about the willingness and capacity of the Greek administration to collect revenues effectively and efficiently. \u2022 Payment arrears weigh on the Greek economy and society and require a far-reaching reform \u2022 Limited progress has been made in selling assets through privatisation, and proceeds in 2013 have so far been clearly below expectations \u2022 Implementation risks to the programme remain important. Looking for more key points now..... With Greece's next aid payment in the bag (see 10.35am), Antonis Samaras said his government is focused on achieving a primary budget surplus (ie, bringing in more revenue than it spends, if debt costs are ignored). Greece is firmly on the path of reform and fiscal adjustment, he insisted. Enrico Letta also told the press conference that Italian firrms are interested in taking part in Greece's privatisation programme -- which has been lagging behind schedule. Here's a snap of the Samaras-Letta press conference: Enrico Letta thanked Antonis Samaras for his welcome to Greece (11.45am), and for his support following the Italian coach crash tragedy in which at least 37 people have died. The Italian PM is upbeat, saying that \"Europe will be reborn in Greece\" and that the future of the continent depends on the success of countries such as Greece and Italy in extracating themselves from the debt crisis. Letta said he had invited Antonis Samaras to Rome in September for further talks before their respective stints with the EU presidency next year. And like Samaras, Letta argued that Europe can turn itself around in 2014. Heads-up: Antonis Samaras and Enrico Letta are holding a press conference in Athens now, following their meeting today. Prime minister Samaras began the press conference by welcoming the Italian leader to Greece, and saying the two leaders had discussed immigation and energy issues . He then declared that 2014 will be a \"Landmark year\" for Europe. Greece will hold the EU presidency for the first six months of 2013, before handing it over to Italy, Samaras pointed out, adding that the two countries want to set joint objectives for the year. The top objective, Samaras announced, is \"a European economy that is free from the scourge of unemployment\". More to follow.... Greece's Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is meeting his Italian counterpart Enrico Letta right now (as flagged up at 9.48am): We're expecting youth unemploymentt to be discussed, along with illegal immigration and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) -- which will transport gas from Greece to southern Italy. Decent economic news in the UK \u2013 retailers have enjoyed their best month's trading since January. The CBI's monthly retail sales index, just released, jumped to +17 in July, up from just +1 in June. That means a sharp rise in the proportion of retailers reporting a rise in sales compared to a year ago. The CBI credited the recent heatwave (yes, overseas readers, it has been sunny in Britain) for driving sales of summer outfits. Clothing and footware sales both rose. But Stephen Gifford, CBI director of economics, warned that Briton's spending power remained limited: A return to even modest spending is welcome news but the bottom line is that confidence will not bounce back fully until family finances improve significantly. Reports from Germany that its parliamentary Budget committee has agreed that Greece has done enough to receive its next aid tranche: As we reported on Friday, eurozone officials have already decided that Greece has met its 22 targets to unlock \u20ac4bn of aid from Europe. National parliamentary approval is the final step. In the City, Barclays has confirmed that it is in talks with regulators about its capital levels, following several reports that a cash call is looming. In a brief statement issued to shareholders a few minutes ago, Barclays said: Barclays has been in discussions with the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) regarding its financial and capital management plans. Barclays will update the market alongside its Interim results on Tuesday 30 July. Shares in Barclays are the biggest faller in London this morning, shedding 3%. Analysts believe Barclays may need to raise up to \u00a37bn to meet a new risk measure. My colleague Jill Treanor covered the issue here: Tense week for banks as Lloyds sell-off looms Back to Greece... where the Italian prime minister Enrico Letta will sitting down for talks with his counterpart, Antonis Samaras, at noon local time (10am BST). Letta's visit is a sign of \"southern European solidarity\", explains our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, who'll be following the meeting. The Italian PM arrived yesterday, and told reporters that he wants to show support for Greece, and show that \"there is a Europe which wants to help Greece so Greece can help itself.\" He also tweeted that Athens is a \"symbol of hope that the EU must change\": Just in: morale among firms in Italy has risen, in an encouraging sign for a country suffering a deep recession. ISTAT, Italy's statistics body, reported that overall business confidence rose to 79.6 this month, up from 76.4 in June. Confidence among manufacturers also increased, to 91.0 from 90.5. Firms are more upbeat about orders and production levels, ISTAT reported. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble's punchy comments on Greece (see 8.02am) came just 10 days after Germany's finance minister visited Athens amid a major security clampdown. During the visit, Sch\u00e4uble paid tribute to Greece's efforts during the crisis. But, as Maria Petrakis explains in Kathimerini today, Greek PM Antonis Samaras has been \"left sweating by Germany\" over the issue of debt relief. Petrakis writes: \u201cGreece needs debt relief to make debt sustainable, but this isn\u2019t something that can enter the German election debate easily,\u201d said Lefteris Farmakis, an analyst at Nomura International in London. \u201cGermans will not accept haircuts. They prefer to grant a very long-term loan with a very low coupon than accept the need for a haircut on official loans.\u201d More here: Samaras sweats as Germany holds back on debt relief Erik Nielsen, chief global economist at Unicredit Bank in London, reckons Europe will see a new, vigorous approach to the eurozone crisis from Germany after the election. Nielsen argues that the current slow progress on various initiatives, such as bank reforms, will end once the polling is over. Bloomberg has the details: The next government \u201cwill be as pro-European, and pro euro, if not more so, than the present one,\u201d Nielsen said in an e-mailed note. \u201cThe overall message to Europe and the world from the German population on September. 22 will be that Germany is as committed to the eurozone as ever. It is time for the remaining euro-sceptics outside the continent to get to grips with this reality.\u201d Every opinion poll for months has shown Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU party winning the most support in September's general election, with upwards of 40% of the vote. However, given Germany's proportional representation system, that's not enough for a majority. And interestingly, one poll yesterday showed that her current coalition with the Free Democrats would also fall short. The Emnid poll put the CDU/CSU on 40%, and the FDP on 5%. On the opposition side, the Social Democrats were polling at 25%, the Greens at 13%, and the Left at 8%. Both the Alternative for Deutschland and the Pirate Party were polling at 3% - below the 5% mark to enter parliament. If this pattern was repeated on 22% September, then Merkel's coalition would be in the minority (45% vs 46%). If the current coalition isn't returned to power, then Merkel could seek a Grand Coalition with the SPD, or an alliance with the Greens. Both parties would demand a change to Germany's approach to the eurozone crisis, with less focus on fiscal cutbacks. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. If you listen carefully, you can hear the sound of the German general election creeping closer. Germany goes to the polls on 22 September, in a vote that could determine the direction of the eurozone crisis. This must have been on the mind of finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble yesterday when he declared that Europe must maintain the pressure on Greece to keep to its austerity pledges. Speaking to Deutschlandfunk radio, Sch\u00e4uble insisted that Greece wasn't getting an easy ride, just because eurozone officials had agreed on Friday to hand over its next bailout payment (worth \u20ac4bn). He said: The pressure remains, so this has nothing to do with the election schedule. They\u2019re far from being over the mountain. With less than eight weeks to go until the ballot takes place, Sch\u00e4uble denied that chancellor Angela Merkel was deliberately hiding the true cost of Europe's rescue packages until the election victory was secured. The development in Europe does not take into consideration election days in individual countries. This is a widespread assumption that is simply false. And in a separate interview on Sunday, Sch\u00e4uble insisted that Greece would not be granted a second debt restructuring, or haircut. All good stuff for the voters. The problem, though, is that many analysts firmly believe Greece will need further aid \u2013 especially with official reports warning of a shortfall in its existing bailout programme. Any deal that trimmed Greece's debt pile again would force losses on official creditors, such as Germany. As Tony Barber put it in the FT last week, this would \"represent a revolution in the eurozone crisis\", but added: Yet in their bones and wallets, German voters already sense that some of the billions of euros lavished on Greece since 2010 will probably never be repaid. To that extent, a second Greek debt restructuring would not shock German taxpayers and destabilise the political scene, although legal hurdles might need to be jumped at the nation\u2019s constitutional court. Anyway.... Sch\u00e4uble's comments set the scene for a fairly calm day in Europe. There will be action in Germany - where a parliamentary committee will decide whether it approves Greece receiving its next aid payment. I'll be tracking all the developments through the day, as usual....",

Photograph: SIMELA PANTZARTZI/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Enrico Letta's visit to Greece, and his strong condemnation of the mistakes made over its bailout programme, are an important signal of solidarity among Southern European states as autumn approaches.</strong></p> <p>So explains our Athens correspondent,&#xa0;<strong>Helena Smith</strong>, who analyses the situation here:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like all politics the Italian prime minister\u2019s trip to Greece has been perfectly choreographed. Ten days after the one-day visit to Athens of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble, and ten days before the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 own trip to Washington, Enrico Letta\u2019a two-day visit has achieved what it was meant to do: display, as never before, that in Europe\u2019s crisis-hit south, solidarity is alive and well.</p> <p>If the US president Barack Obama thought basket case Greece was out on a limb, he will now have to think again. Samaras, a traditional conservative, could not have written such endorsement.</p> <p>Left-wing leader Letta came promising encouragement for Athens - \u201cand to say there is a Europe that wants to help Greece\u201d - and he handed it out in dollops. Not since the eruption of the debt crisis almost four years ago, has a visiting politician delivered such a withering attack on the policies of austerity.</p> <p>Ahead of the German elections in late September, the Greek prime minister was given the perfect opportunity to ram home the message that austerity-inducing recession is not only not working, it needs to be replaced by policies of growth. That Greece is far from the \u201csuccess story\u201d the two-party governing coalition has trumpeted in recent months, was underscored by Schauble himself when he announced Sunday that \u201cGreece has in no way crossed the mountain.\u201d</p> <p>More than ever, it needed to apply painful cuts, not least in the public sector where 12,500 will be added to the record numbers of unemployed by the end of the year.</p> </blockquote> <p>And with today\u2019s European Commission report (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jul/29/eurozone-crisis-germany-greece-austerity-election#block-51f6562fe4b041a68c3f19ce\">12.49pm</a>) predicting yet more shrinkage in an economy that has contracted by nearly 25 % since 2009, far from being on the road to recovery, Athens is headed for a very rough ride.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As Letta pointed out, in such unfettered fashion today,&#xa0;policies will have to change drastically and stop being an end in themselves if Europe and Greece are ever to turn around.</p> </blockquote> <h2>And that's a good moment to stop.</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jul/29/eurozone-crisis-germany-greece-austerity-election#block-51f67236e4b088265baef68e\">Details of Letta's stirring attack on eurozone failings are here</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jul/29/eurozone-crisis-germany-greece-austerity-election#block-51f647bae4b041a68c3f19cb\">Highlights of his press conference with Antonis Samaras start here</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jul/29/eurozone-crisis-germany-greece-austerity-election#block-51f60c77e4b088265baef67c\">Details of Wolfgang Schauble's comments on Greece start here</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jul/29/eurozone-crisis-germany-greece-austerity-election#block-51f6562fe4b041a68c3f19ce\">Coverage of the latest review of Greece's bailout programme start here</a></p> <p>And there's various other breaking news and suchlike scattered through the blog.....</p> <p><strong>I'll be back tomorrow for more of the same.

Photograph: THOMAS PETER/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy.</strong></p> <p>If you listen carefully, you can hear the sound of the German general election creeping closer. Germany goes to the polls on 22 September, in a vote that could determine the direction of the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>This must have been on the mind of finance minister <strong>Wolfgang&#xa0;Sch\u00e4uble</strong> yesterday when he declared that Europe must maintain the pressure on Greece to keep to its austerity pledges.</p> <p>Speaking to Deutschlandfunk radio, Sch\u00e4uble insisted that Greece wasn't getting an easy ride, just because eurozone officials had agreed on Friday to hand over its next bailout payment (worth \u20ac4bn). He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pressure remains, so this has nothing to do with the election schedule.</p> <p>They\u2019re far from being over the mountain.</p> </blockquote> <p>With less than eight weeks to go until the ballot takes place, Sch\u00e4uble denied that chancellor Angela Merkel was deliberately hiding the true cost of Europe's rescue packages until the election victory was secured.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The development in Europe does not take into consideration election days in individual countries. This is a widespread assumption that is simply false.</p> </blockquote> <p>And in a separate interview on Sunday, <strong>Sch\u00e4uble</strong> insisted that Greece would not be granted a second debt restructuring, or haircut.</p> <p>All good stuff for the voters. The problem, though, is that many analysts firmly believe Greece will need further aid \u2013 especially with official reports warning of a shortfall in its existing bailout programme. Any deal that trimmed Greece's debt pile again would force losses on official creditors, such as Germany.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5bb17dae-f2c7-11e2-a203-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz2aPnSOWid\">Tony Barber put it in the FT last week</a>, this would \"represent a revolution in the eurozone crisis\", but added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yet in their bones and wallets, German voters already sense that some of the billions of euros lavished on Greece since 2010 will probably never be repaid.</p> <p>To that extent, a second Greek debt restructuring would not shock German taxpayers and destabilise the political scene, although legal hurdles might need to be jumped at the nation\u2019s constitutional court.</p> </blockquote> <p>Anyway.... <strong>Sch\u00e4uble's</strong> comments set the scene for a fairly calm day in Europe. There will be action in Germany - where a parliamentary committee will decide whether it approves Greece receiving its next aid payment.</p> <p><strong>I'll be tracking all the developments through the day, as usual....</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-07-29T13:24:20.552Z\">at 2.24pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "China's local authorities and state enterprises will come under scrutiny in the coming months after the government said it planned to audit their debts. In a one sentence announcement on its website, the National Audit Office (NAO) said it planned to embark on a nationwide assessment of borrowing by public bodies, underlining fears that thousands of local councils and state-owned businesses in the world's second biggest economy have over-stretched themselves and are close to collapse. The NAO said other audit projects would be frozen to complete the task, but failed to give a publication date. Some analysts believe China's myriad local and state enterprises, many of which have borrowed heavily to invest in property, new factories and machinery over two decades of rapid economic expansion, have racked up debts of about $3tn (\u00a32tn). There is a suspicion that companies, especially in the heavy industrial sector and commercial property industry, have used cheap loans to increase production and pay higher wages rather than assess the long-term viability of their businesses. Local governments, which are prevented from taking on debt directly, but have borrowed heavily through special-purpose vehicles, have frequently borrowed from companies in private arrangements at high cost, with the money often used in speculative real-estate projects. Much of the lending is also believed to be directed to businesses that pay the highest bribes, undermining standard credit controls. Last year a new communist party leadership took control in Beijing promising to crackdown on corruption and graft. A slowdown in output over the past six months has been blamed on tackling corruption alongside a greater emphasis away from investment towards domestic consumption. A local government buckling under the weight of its own debt is a troubling scenario for the leadership, and one that Deutsche Bank has said could potentially pose a systemic and macroeconomic risk to the country. Standard Chartered, Fitch and Credit Suisse have estimated local government debt in China at the equivalent of anywhere between 15% and 36% of the country's output, or as much as $3tn based on World Bank GDP figures for 2012. Chinese economists point out that the state has access to $3.5tn of foreign reserves built up in the boom times, which can be used to bail out failing enterprises or for investment in areas that ministers believe will create economic benefit. Justin Lin, a former World Bank chief economist and senior adviser to the Chinese government, said at a conference in London last month that, while it was possible for Beijing to push through structural reforms too quickly and stymie growth, it was an unlikely outcome. He predicted the economy would grow between 7.5% 8% for the next 20 years at least as domestic consumption on areas like health increase dramatically. \"China is a developing country and there is still so much scope for investment,\" he said. Lin, a professor at Peking University, said China would cope with a rapidly ageing population and higher wage costs by turning to neighbouring countries, which act like subsidiaries with large pools of young labour. \"As long as it is made politically palatable in these countries for them to behave almost as client states, they can all benefit. Then there is the ability to increase the retirement age from the current 60 for men and 55 for women. Also the quality of the labour force can increase to offset the relative decline in the number of young people coming into it.\" Vice-finance minister Zhu Guangyao said earlier this month that the government did not know precisely how much debt local governments had built up. The audit office warned in a June report that debt levels among local governments are rising and the financial burdens and risks are not being properly managed.

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has warned that hot weather in northern Europe has hit its summer bookings and prevented the carrier from pushing through a double-digit fare increase. Announcing a 21% year-on-year fall in first quarter profits to \u20ac78m (\u00a367m), the Irish carrier admitted that the heatwave in Britain and elsewhere had meant fewer high-revenue late bookings in recent weeks. It said the effect would be felt in the next quarter's results \u2013 traditionally the period where the airline generates the most revenue and profits. Deputy chief executive Howard Millar said there had been a \"weakness\" in late bookings this summer, which were normally \"the cream\" for Ryanair, as he blamed the hot weather keeping people from wanting to book a holiday abroad. He said average fares would have been almost 10% higher without the heatwave, adding: \"Our cream will be a little thinner. We'll just have to get by.\" Despite the fall in bookings, Millar claimed the airline would make up the shortfall from the three months to 30 June, where profits were dampened by a late Easter and air traffic controller strikes in France. Millar also pointed to the impact of high fuel prices, which make up 47% of the airline's costs. He said the company had made efficiencies to reduce the bill by 15% to \u20ac170m \u2013 including flying its planes slower. He claimed that the unspecified reduction in speed from about 600mph was saving fuel at a difference in journey time of just a couple of minutes per hour, but stressed there were no safety issues. Millar said: \"When you tell everyone you are flying slightly slower the first thing people say is the plane will fall out of the sky.\" The fuel bill was also lower due to a large reduction in passengers checking in luggage, after charges drove the proportion down to about 30% \u2013 a change he said represented 40m fewer items a year on Ryanair planes. Millar said Ryanair would continue to expand its geographical reach as its fleet expands from 290 to 410 planes over the next six years. He said they would be interested in starting flights to Turkey provided an open skies agreement was reached with the EU, and elsewhere in the periphery of Europe. Millar also confirmed that the airline had been in discussion with the Israeli government about new routes. The airline expects a ruling from the UK competition commission on 13 August, which may see Ryanair ordered to sell down its stake in Aer Lingus. Millar said it was a \"bizarre situation\", and accused the commission of wasting \"[British] taxpayer money investigating two Irish carriers\". However, he said the airline would resist as long as possible in the hope it could eventually take over its Irish rival and pursue a \"dual-brand strategy\", likening its approach to manufacturers who sell \"the same soap powder\" for more money in different packaging.",

Millar said: \"When you tell everyone you are flying slightly slower the first thing people say is the plane will fall out of the sky.\"</p> <p>The fuel bill was also lower due to a large reduction in passengers checking in luggage, after charges drove the proportion down to about 30% \u2013 a change he said represented 40m fewer items a year on Ryanair planes. Millar said Ryanair would continue to expand its geographical reach as its fleet expands from 290 to 410 planes over the next six years. He said they would be interested in starting flights to Turkey provided an open skies agreement was reached with the EU, and elsewhere in the periphery of Europe. Millar also confirmed that the airline had been in discussion with the Israeli government about new routes.</p> <p>The airline expects a ruling from the UK competition commission on 13 August, which may see Ryanair ordered to sell down its stake in Aer Lingus. Millar said it was a \"bizarre situation\", and accused the commission of wasting \"[British] taxpayer money investigating two Irish carriers\". However, he said the airline would resist as long as possible in the hope it could eventually take over its Irish rival and pursue a \"dual-brand strategy\", likening its approach to manufacturers who sell \"the same soap powder\" for more money in different packaging.</p>",

Publishers of titles such as Front, Loaded, Nuts and Zoo have been given until 9 September to deliver the magazines in pre-sealed bags designed to obscure the front cover, otherwise, the Co-op says, it will stop selling the magazines.The supermarket chain says that the move is in response to growing concern among its members, customers and colleagues about the exposure of children to the overt sexual images on such front covers which, despite the retailer's efforts, are still sometimes visible in-store. Steve Murrells, chief executive of food and retail for the Co-operative Group, said: \"We have listened to the concerns of our customers and members, many of whom say they object to their children being able to see overt sexual images in our stores. While we have tried to mitigate the likelihood of young children seeing the images \u2013 with a number of measures in-store \u2013 the most effective way of doing this is for these magazines to be put in individual, sealed modesty bags.\" The Sport newspaper has already agreed to deliver all editions to Co-op stores in this way from September, following pressure from the retailer. The Co-op's move comes two years after a recommendation by the government-appointed Bailey review that such magazines and newspapers should be displayed only the top shelf or have the images on the front covered by a \"modesty sleeve\". The National Federation of Retail Newsagents' code of practice says that adult material should be on the top shelf. It also recommends that men's lifestyle magazines should not be displayed next to children's titles or at a level at which they can be seen by children.The six-month review was launched amid concern about the commercialisation and sexualisation of children in Britain. The author of the report, Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers' Union, said he hoped his review would help tear down the sexual \"wallpaper\" surrounding today's young people and give parents a stronger voice in regulation. On behalf of the magazines' publishers, a spokesperson for the Professional Publishers Association (PPA), said they were acting responsibly and within government guidelines. \"Men's lifestyle magazines are mainstream titles enjoyed by a readership of millions and feature content to reflect the diverse interests of the nation's young men. The average age of a reader of men's lifestyle magazines is 30, according to the National Readership Surveyand these titles are not created for, or marketed to, children. Publishers support the guidelines on the appropriate display of men's lifestyle magazines, which have been drawn up with the National Federation of Retail Newsagents and endorsed by the Home Office.\" But Jo Swinson MP, minister for women and equalities and also minister for employment relations and consumer affairs, said: \"Many parents aren't comfortable with the way that sexualised imagery has become like wallpaper \u2013 everywhere from the bus stop to the corner shop. Exposing children to lewd pictures that portray women as sex objects is not appropriate. That's why the Co-operative's decision to implement the Bailey review recommendation for publications with overtly sexual images on the cover to be displayed and sold in modesty bags is very welcome.\" She said adults \"should be left to make their own decisions about what legal sexual images they look at, but the place for these is not next to the sweets at children's eye-level. I hope other retailers will follow the Co-operative's lead.\" Sophie Bennet, spokeswoman for the Lose the Lad's Mags campaign by UK Feminista and Object said that the Co-op's move did not go far enough. \"The more accurate term for these so-called \"modesty bags\" is \"misogyny bags\" because the issue for the thousands of people who have called on shops to lose the lads' mags is absolutely not about nudity. It's about sexism. And if a product is so degrading to women that it has to be covered up then the Co-operative should not be selling it. \"By stocking magazines like Nuts and Zoo, retailers like the Co-operative and Tesco are sending out the damaging message that it is normal and acceptable to treat women like dehumanised sex objects. Continuing to profit from sexist magazines would be at fundamental odds with the Co-operative's claim of being the 'UK's leading responsible retailer'.\"",
