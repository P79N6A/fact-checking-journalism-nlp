      "bodyText": "The Trump administration and Senate Republicans rolled back labor protection laws on Monday in a pair of moves that labor advocates predict will chill complaints by vulnerable workers, especially in the low-wage food processing industry, which relies heavily on easily exploited undocumented laborers. The Senate voted along party lines, 49-48, to repeal an Obama-era executive order mandating accurate labor violation record-keeping, meaning that companies with on-the-job accidents and fatalities no longer have to disclose that information in order to receive lucrative government contracts. Earlier the same day, Trump issued an executive order promising to \u201crigorously evaluate all grounds of inadmissibility or deportability\u201d with respect to foreign nationals on US soil. The House already voted to pass the bill revoking the record-keeping order; Trump has said he will sign it into law. Some 134 public interest groups, from the ACLU to the Sierra Club, signed a petition to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, asking the Senate to keep the disclosure law as is. McConnell, with his fellow Republicans, voted to rescind it. Debbie Berkowitz, formerly a senior official with the Obama administration\u2019s Office of Safety and Health Administration (Osha), called Congress\u2019s decision to undo Obama\u2019s order a major setback for workers. When the order is rescinded by Congress, it cannot be reissued by another president. She said one of the industries most likely to experience the impact of the repeal is the poultry industry, an industry with high rate of worker injury and death, large government contracts, and a historical reliance on undocumented workers. Berkowitz told the Guardian she believed the chicken-processing industry targets recent refugees and undocumented immigrants for employment because they are less likely to complain. Under Trump, she said, things will get even worse. \u201cThis administration is totally for corporations and lobbyists and not for the American worker,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of good industries out there,\u201d Berkowitz said, but she does not believe poultry processing is one of them. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get away with hiring workers and then terrorizing them to get away with unsafe working conditions.\u201d Berkowitz currently works for a non-profit called the National Employment Law Project. \u201cThis is an industry that purposely locates in areas, in rural out-of-the-way areas where they can hire workers that are newly resettled from other countries.\u201d The poultry industry will also probably benefit from continued exploitation of undocumented workers and recent refugees, noted by Oxfam, Human Rights Watch and many others, while undocumented workers themselves continue to live in fear of edicts like Trump\u2019s executive order, she said. \u201cWorkers are already scared to talk to Osha; they definitely won\u2019t talk to Osha now,\u201d said Berkowitz, who worked as chief of staff and later senior policy analyst with Osha from 2009 to 2015. There are reasons for that high level of mistrust: under George W Bush, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents impersonated Osha inspectors in order to gain access to facilities where undocumented immigrants were employed. The specter of a 2008 raid on a Postville, Iowa, poultry processor looms large over any worker afraid of being separated from family and community over immigration status. Workers at the Postville AgriProcessors chicken processing facility asked Ice to forgo any planned enforcement actions while they unionized. Instead, Ice arrested 600 people and tried 300 of them in four days in an ad hoc courtroom set up at a local fairground, where they were sentenced five at a time. While some have criticized Obama\u2019s record on deportations, Berkowitz said under Bush it was even worse. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear that things will get worse [again],\u201d Berkowitz said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be cutbacks on enforcement by worker protection agencies that say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to comply with the law.\u2019\u201d Worker protections save taxpayer money, said Berkowitz and too often, the plight of the animals being processed receives closer attention than the treatment of the people processing them: \u201cConsumers care about whether it\u2019s organic, whether it\u2019s free-range, whether it\u2019s humanely raised, but what about the nation\u2019s men and women who staff the plants? Do they care if they\u2019re humanely treated? It\u2019s not just \u2018being nice\u2019. A lot of these people are on public assistance because it\u2019s a very low-wage job, so the taxpayer subsidizes the industry.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Business leaders have made a final plea to the chancellor to reduce the impact of changes to commercial rates that could double the tax bill for some firms. The trade body for retailers, the British Retail Consortium, has written to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, saying the high street needs a \u201cfundamental reform\u201d of the tax, while a survey by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) found that business rates are the biggest concern for one in two small firms. Britain\u2019s live music scene could also be harmed by the changes to the business rates, according to a new report. A census of live music in the country by the universities of Edinburgh, Newcastle and Glasgow has found that the rateable value for some music venues will rise by up to 55%. The rateable value determines the level of business rates firms will pay. Matt Brennan, of the University of Edinburgh, said: \u201cVenues around the country have been telling us that they already operate on thin margins, so proposed increases in rateable values of up to 55% in some cases will have a significant impact.\u201d The change in business rates payments from April is down to the revaluation of property in Britain. This is supposed to take place every five years but the previous revaluation was controversially delayed by the government in 2015 for two years, making the changes to payments more pronounced. The government has accused critics of scaremongering, claiming that rates for three-quarters of businesses would either remain the same or fall. Research by the Centre for Cities has found that business rates will fall in all but two cities in England and Wales \u2013 London and Reading. London faces a tax rise of 9% compared with cuts of 25% in Blackburn, Lancashire, and 24% in Blackpool, also in Lancashire, and Newport, Wales. The changes mean that businesses in central London will contribute more than a fifth of the overall rates bill for England and Wales. However, the BCC said there was an \u201curgent need\u201d for action on business rates in the budget. As well as short-term relief for the worst-hit businesses it wants the chancellor to abandon the principle that income from the tax must stay the same each year apart from an adjustment for inflation in order for the government to offer more help to struggling firms. It also wants to make it easier to appeal against rates valuations, switch how the annual inflation increase is calculated \u2013 from RPI to the lower rate of CPI \u2013 and remove all plant and machinery from the tax. Adam Marshall, director-general of the BCC, said: \u201cRising business concerns demonstrate the urgent need for action on business rates in the budget this week. The UK had the highest business property taxes in the developed world even before the recent revaluation \u2013 hammering firms with sky-high costs before they turn over a single pound. This undermines business investment, which in 2016, fell for the first time in seven years.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Theresa May must give Vauxhall assurances over Brexit, says Labour", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May is facing calls to guarantee that Brexit will not harm the operations of Vauxhall after PSA, the French owner of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn, announced a deal to buy the British car manufacturer. Labour said the company would need stronger assurances from the government about UK carmaking after Brexit, despite PSA\u2019s claim that it wants to avoid factory closures and job cuts in the UK. Vauxhall employs 4,500 people at plants in Ellesmere Port, Merseyside, and Luton, Bedfordshire. Greg Clark, the business secretary, told the House of Commons on Monday that the government was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the deal. He said ministers would hold PSA to its intentions to \u201csafeguard the plants, honour their commitments and look to increase the performance and the sales of cars\u201d as well as a promise that \u201cno pensioner, current or prospective, will be worse off in any way\u201d. Clark insisted that Brexit was not relevant to the deal: \u201cThis is a restructuring of the organisation. In my discussions with PSA, the chief executive said today that Brexit isn\u2019t an essential driver of this.\u201d Under existing agreements with Vauxhall\u2019s current owner General Motors, which PSA has pledged to recognise, Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port plant will produce the Astra car until 2021 and the Luton plant will make the Vivaro van until 2025. However, PSA will need to make a decision on where the next Astra will be manufactured after 2021 as early as next year, meaning Ellesmere Port faces a battle with rival plants in France and Germany during the middle of the UK\u2019s negotiations to leave the EU. The Labour frontbench and MPs whose constituents work for Vauxhall said they were worried about the impact of Brexit in the coming years as PSA makes decisions about whether to invest more money in UK operations. There are potential concerns about the future of a UK-based partnership between Vauxhall and Renault, which is a major rival of PSA, to make vans in Luton. Speaking in the House of Commons, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, called for PSA to be given the same assurances as Nissan \u2013 owner of Britain\u2019s largest car plant in Sunderland - that Brexit would not be allowed to affect its carmaking operations. \u201cHas PSA been offered the same deal?\u201d she said. \u201cIf so, would it not make sense for the government to set out its strategy for this sector as a whole rather than enlightening businesses one crisis at a time?\u201d Angela Eagle, the former shadow business secretary, whose Wallasey constituents include workers for Vauxhall and its supply chain, said she was concerned about the extra cost imposed on carmakers when the UK left the single market and customs union after 2019. \u201cMoving from an America-owned inward investor to a French- and German-owned inward investor might not be brilliant because there is always a chance they might want to consolidate within the EU,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a big domestic market which nobody ought to sneeze at but the government are going to have to work very hard to convince car manufacturers that the help they will get with producing compensates for some of the costs and uncertainties of losing membership of the single market.\u201d Eagle said it was a \u201cquestion of whether Greg Clark will get his chequebook out\u201d when future decisions about investment in Vauxhall production lines came to be made. Gavin Shuker, the Labour MP for Luton South where a Vauxhall factory is based, said the major concerns around the deal were about the impact of Brexit. \u201cIf you viewed it in purely rational terms, both plants in the UK have got a very secure future. They are both highly efficient and making money for a loss-making company. So the real questions is Brexit. We have a government pursuing a very hard-edged model of Brexit,\u201d he said. May\u2019s official spokesman insisted that no specific assurances were given to Peugeot to secure the future of the UK plants. \u201cIn terms of specific assurances \u2013 none sought, none given,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a stated position that we will ensure the competitiveness of this country when it comes to the supply chain, research and development and trade.\u201d There are concerns about the pensions of Vauxhall workers, who could face a cut of between 10% and 15% to their pay and benefits. The Vauxhall pension scheme is estimated to have a deficit of \u00a31bn. Under the deal, GM will pay \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.6bn) to PSA to settle the pension obligations of its European business and will keep most of the historic liabilities. Vauxhall workers are likely to move from a final salary pension scheme they had with GM to a less lucrative defined contribution scheme with PSA. John Ralfe, an independent pension consultant, said: \u201cAt the moment, the Vauxhall workers are in a generous defined benefit pension, based on their salary and years\u2019 service. PSA has not said what sort of pension they will get under their ownership, but it is likely to be a defined contribution, with no guaranteed pension. This change will be a fall in overall pay and perks of 10% to 15%.\u201d Earlier, Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of PSA, vowed to turn Opel and Vauxhall around without factory closures or job cuts, after agreeing to buy the car brands from General Motors for \u20ac2.2bn (\u00a31.9bn). Nonetheless, PSA is looking to cut \u20ac1.7bn off annual costs in purchasing, manufacturing, and research and development by 2026 following the deal. Tavares told a press conference in Paris: \u201cWe do not need to shut down plants \u2026 Shutting down plants is rather simplistic.\u201d He stressed that he had not closed a single factory since he took over at PSA in 2014. The carmaker, which came close to bankruptcy and was bailed out by the French government and Chinese investors, shut a French factory just before the former Nissan executive took the helm.",

Vauxhall employs 4,500 people at plants in Ellesmere Port, Merseyside, and Luton, Bedfordshire.</p> <p>Greg Clark, the business secretary, told the House of Commons on Monday that the government was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the deal. He said ministers would hold PSA to its intentions to \u201csafeguard the plants, honour their commitments and look to increase the performance and the sales of cars\u201d as well as a promise that \u201cno pensioner, current or prospective, will be worse off in any way\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/06/vauxhalls-luton-and-ellesmere-port-factories-will-face-battle-after-2021\">Vauxhall's Luton and Ellesmere Port factories will face battle after 2021</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clark insisted that Brexit was not relevant to the deal: \u201cThis is a restructuring of the organisation. In my discussions with PSA, the chief executive said today that Brexit isn\u2019t an essential driver of this.\u201d</p> <p>Under existing agreements with Vauxhall\u2019s current owner General Motors, which PSA has pledged to recognise, Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port plant will produce the Astra car until 2021 and the Luton plant will make the Vivaro van until 2025.</p> <p>However, PSA will need to make a decision on where the next Astra will be manufactured after 2021 as early as next year, meaning Ellesmere Port faces a battle with rival plants in France and Germany during the middle of the UK\u2019s negotiations to leave the EU.</p> <p>The Labour frontbench and MPs whose constituents work for Vauxhall said they were worried about the impact of Brexit in the coming years as PSA makes decisions about whether to invest more money in UK operations. There are potential concerns about the future of a UK-based partnership between Vauxhall and Renault, which is a major rival of PSA, to make vans in Luton.</p> <p>Speaking in the House of Commons, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, called for PSA to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/28/brexit-taxpayers-support-supply-chain-nissan-sunderland-car-auto\">given the same assurances as Nissan \u2013 owner of Britain\u2019s largest car plant in Sunderland - that Brexit would not be allowed to affect its carmaking operations. </a></p> <p>\u201cHas PSA been offered the same deal?\u201d she said. \u201cIf so, would it not make sense for the government to set out its strategy for this sector as a whole rather than enlightening businesses one crisis at a time?\u201d</p> <p>Angela Eagle, the former shadow business secretary, whose Wallasey constituents include workers for Vauxhall and its supply chain, said she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/03/brexit-uk-car-industry-mini-britain-eu\">concerned about the extra cost imposed on carmakers when the UK left the single market and customs union after 2019.</a></p> <p>\u201cMoving from an America-owned inward investor to a French- and German-owned inward investor might not be brilliant because there is always a chance they might want to consolidate within the EU,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a big domestic market which nobody ought to sneeze at but the government are going to have to work very hard to convince car manufacturers that the help they will get with producing compensates for some of the costs and uncertainties of losing membership of the single market.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Eagle said it was a \u201cquestion of whether Greg Clark will get his chequebook out\u201d when future decisions about investment in Vauxhall production lines came to be made.</p> <p>Gavin Shuker, the Labour MP for Luton South where a Vauxhall factory is based, said the major concerns around the deal were about the impact of Brexit.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf you viewed it in purely rational terms, both plants in the UK have got a very secure future. They are both highly efficient and making money for a loss-making company. So the real questions is Brexit. We have a government pursuing a very hard-edged model of Brexit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>May\u2019s official spokesman insisted that no specific assurances were given to Peugeot to secure the future of the UK plants.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of specific assurances \u2013 none sought, none given,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a stated position that we will ensure the competitiveness of this country when it comes to the supply chain, research and development and trade.\u201d </p> <p>There are concerns about the pensions of Vauxhall workers, who could face a cut of between 10% and 15% to their pay and benefits. </p> <p>The Vauxhall pension scheme is estimated to have a deficit of \u00a31bn. Under the deal, GM will pay \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.6bn) to PSA to settle the pension obligations of its European business and will keep most of the historic liabilities. Vauxhall workers are likely to move from a final salary pension scheme they had with GM to a less lucrative defined contribution scheme with PSA.</p> <p>John Ralfe, an independent pension consultant, said: \u201cAt the moment, the Vauxhall workers are in a generous defined benefit pension, based on their salary and years\u2019 service. PSA has not said what sort of pension they will get under their ownership, but it is likely to be a defined contribution, with no guaranteed pension. This change will be a fall in overall pay and perks of 10% to 15%.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of PSA, vowed to turn Opel and Vauxhall around without factory closures or job cuts, after agreeing to buy the car brands from General Motors for \u20ac2.2bn (\u00a31.9bn).</p> <p>Nonetheless, PSA is looking to cut \u20ac1.7bn off annual costs in purchasing, manufacturing, and research and development by 2026 following the deal. Tavares told a press conference in Paris: \u201cWe do not need to shut down plants \u2026 Shutting down plants is rather simplistic.\u201d</p> <p>He stressed that he had not closed a single factory since he took over at PSA in 2014. The carmaker, which came close to bankruptcy and was bailed out by the French government and Chinese investors, shut a French factory just before the former Nissan executive took the helm.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Vauxhall\u2019s factories in Ellesmere Port and Luton will have to battle with Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn, and Opel plants across Europe to win the right to produce vehicles beyond 2021. The future of Vauxhall\u2019s sites is secure until then because PSA Group, which has bought Vauxhall and Opel from General Motors, has pledged to recognise existing production commitments. Ellesmere Port is scheduled to produce the Astra until 2021 while Luton will make the Vivaro van until 2025. However, PSA will have to make a decision on where to produce the next-generation Astra from 2021 as early as next year, and Ellesmere Port faces a significant challenge to win the work and secure its survival. David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston University, said Ellesmere Port is vulnerable due to the uncertainty over Brexit, the number of car parts that Vauxhall has to import and the looser labour laws in Britain than on the continent. The prospect of Brexit looms over the car industry because for each vehicle that is produced in the UK there are hundreds and thousands of movements of parts across the Channel. If Britain leaves the single market and the customs union this will add cost and delays to production at car plants in the country. UK car factories already operate on profit margins of less than 10% and a production model called \u201cjust-in-time\u201d means parts arrive at plants just hours before they are added to the car, so any interruption could make them unviable. Bailey said: \u201cParts can cross the Channel three, four, five times, so you need to manage those barriers in terms of tariffs and bureaucracy.\u201d Ellesmere Port would be particularly affected by the introduction of tariffs because it has to import 75% of the parts on the Astra \u2013 above the UK average of 59% \u2013 and then exports 80% of the cars. The majority of the parts come from Europe, including the engine from Hungary and the gearboxes from Austria and Germany, as well as Korea. The chairman of PSA, Carlos Tavares, has claimed a hard Brexit could offer an opportunity to build the supply chain in Britain. But this would take substantial investment from companies that make car parts and financial backing from the government. \u201cThe government will have to help,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cBut even that might not be enough if we get a hard Brexit.\u201d The reason for Bailey\u2019s concern is that other factors will be considered by PSA, including the fact that it is easier to make people redundant in Britain than in France. Ellesmere Port and Luton are considered to be efficient plants, but in 2006 Peugeot announced it would close its last UK car plant despite the fact it was considered to be performing well. \u201cPeugeot shut Coventry 10 years ago and moved production to Slovakia. That plant was efficient and profitable, it was just easier to sack workers here than in France,\u201d he said. Sir Vince Cable, the business secretary between 2010 and 2015, also warned that the French and German governments would lobby heavily win the right to produce the Astra in their plants. Cable and the trade unions convinced General Motors to make the existing Astra at Ellesmere Port, but he said it had been a close fight in 2012. \u201cTheir initial instincts were to close Ellesmere Port and consolidate in Germany. There was heavy German lobbying,\u201d he said. \u201cI imagine there will be some ferocious German canvassing [this time] and it is difficult to see what Britain can offer other than years of uncertainty.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Martin Gilbert of Aberdeen Asset Management, we thought, only had eyes for American suitors. He has been singing for ages about the appeal of the US, home of vast piles of investment cash, and he was an admirer of Anglo-Australian manager Henderson\u2019s \u201cclever\u201d merger with Janus Capital of the US. In the end, though, he has settled on a partner led by his old fishing chum Keith Skeoch 100 miles away in Edinburgh. Standard Life\u2019s presence in the US, however, is rather like Aberdeen\u2019s \u2013 small. Is this a case of there being no takers for Aberdeen in the US? Or is it a glorious realisation that an alliance at home tends to be safer and simpler? Probably more of the former, but there\u2019s no disgrace in taking the defensive Scottish option. This deal is driven by a mutual need to cut costs and the all-share merger \u2013 effectively, a takeover by Standard Life of a company half its size \u2013 offers the chance of quick results. Most medium-sized active managers are under pressure from lower-cost passive funds, many of them giant US institutions charging fractions of a percentage point in fees. For higher-charging active houses, the future lies in hammering down costs and hoping the humans can beat the machines more often. Cost savings are put at \u00a3200m, which equates to 10% of the combined base. That is meaningful. The fit in terms of portfolio range is also good. Aberdeen brings specialism in emerging markets, especially Asia. Standard Life is strong in developed markets, both in equities and fixed income, and brings to the table its \u00a350bn GARS fund, a so-called \u201cabsolute return\u201d fund that seeks to dampen market volatility. Does greater scale and diversity open more doors to institutional clients, especially in the US market that Gilbert presumably still regards as a big prize? Absolutely, but not as surely as strong investment performance and favourable investment fashions. Aberdeen has been leaking funds in the soggy Asian market for three years. Standard Life lost its fizz last year as GARS underperformed its benchmark. A turnaround on both fronts is as important as the cost savings. An all-Scottish deal at least makes the wider politics easy. There will be job losses but it must be better for Scotland that Aberdeen is not consumed by a US firm and instead becomes part of one that will be Europe\u2019s second largest fund manager. The trickier political piece lies the boardroom, where Skeoch and Gilbert will be co-chief executives, an arrangement with a poor record elsewhere. Personal friendship is helpful but ripping costs out of a company worth \u00a311bn is not like spending a pleasant afternoon together on the river Tay. \u201cA single CEO calling the shots and retaining overall responsibility is critical in all such transactions,\u201d says Shore Capital\u2019s Eamonn Flanagan. He has a point. If there is a reason to believe the Gilbert &amp; Skeoch show can defy the doubters, it may be fact that both companies have had near-death experiences in the past 15 years. Standard Life demutualised in 2006 to escape a mess in endowment mortgages. Aberdeen went to the brink a couple of years earlier by selling split capital investment trusts, a terrible financial product. Those brushes with disaster may concentrate minds on the long-term. But if happy harmony proves impossible, one man \u2013 presumably Gilbert, as Aberdeen is the junior partner \u2013 will have to fall on his fishing rod. On day one, though, this looks a logical deal. In an industry that is increasingly global, both sides need to be bigger and leaner. It could work. PSA can\u2019t avoid politics in Vauxhall deal Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Peugeot owner PSA, was full of soothing words for his British audience as Vauxhall came under his control. In a soft Brexit, the cheaper pound would boost competitiveness of the Ellesmere Port and Luton plants. A harder exit from the European single market would provide a \u201cvery nice opportunity\u201d to source more car parts inside the UK. Don\u2019t rely too heavily on these statements. Tavares is in the business of cutting costs and plants are always in a state of internal competition at pan-European car manufacturers to secure the next model. The Astra is safe at Ellesmere Port until 2021 but decisions on a successor will start to be made next year. The timing is awkward because the form of Brexit may not be clear by then. Consider Taveres\u2019 \u201cnice opportunity\u201d an appeal for the UK government to fund a re-arming of the UK supplier base. Ellesmere Port imports 75% of its parts. To enjoy the benefits of a cheaper pound, the ratio might have to fall below 50%. There is indeed an attractive opening there for UK firms, but it may require government to push the market harder and faster that it would move on its own. Politics is never far away in the car business.",

Or is it a glorious realisation that an alliance at home tends to be safer and simpler? Probably more of the former, but there\u2019s no disgrace in taking the defensive Scottish option. This deal is driven by a mutual need to cut costs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/06/job-losses-likely-standard-life-aberdeen-asset-management-merger\">the all-share merger</a> \u2013 effectively, a takeover by Standard Life of a company half its size \u2013 offers the chance of quick results.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/06/job-losses-likely-standard-life-aberdeen-asset-management-merger\">Standard Life and Aberdeen seek to tie in key staff in \u00a311bn merger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most medium-sized active managers are under pressure from lower-cost passive funds, many of them giant US institutions charging fractions of a percentage point in fees. For higher-charging active houses, the future lies in hammering down costs and hoping the humans can beat the machines more often.</p> <p>Cost savings are put at \u00a3200m, which equates to 10% of the combined base. That is meaningful. The fit in terms of portfolio range is also good. Aberdeen brings specialism in emerging markets, especially Asia. Standard Life is strong in developed markets, both in equities and fixed income, and brings to the table its \u00a350bn GARS fund, a so-called \u201cabsolute return\u201d fund that seeks to dampen market volatility.</p> <p>Does greater scale and diversity open more doors to institutional clients, especially in the US market that Gilbert presumably still regards as a big prize? Absolutely, but not as surely as strong investment performance and favourable investment fashions. Aberdeen has been leaking funds in the soggy Asian market for three years. Standard Life lost its fizz last year as GARS underperformed its benchmark. A turnaround on both fronts is as important as the cost savings.</p> <p>An all-Scottish deal at least makes the wider politics easy. There will be job losses but it must be better for Scotland that Aberdeen is not consumed by a US firm and instead becomes part of one that will be Europe\u2019s second largest fund manager.</p> <p>The trickier political piece lies the boardroom, where Skeoch and Gilbert will be co-chief executives, an arrangement with a poor record elsewhere. Personal friendship is helpful but ripping costs out of a company worth \u00a311bn is not like spending a pleasant afternoon together on the river Tay. \u201cA single CEO calling the shots and retaining overall responsibility is critical in all such transactions,\u201d says Shore Capital\u2019s Eamonn Flanagan. He has a point.</p> <p>If there is a reason to believe the Gilbert &amp; Skeoch show can defy the doubters, it may be fact that both companies have had near-death experiences in the past 15 years. Standard Life <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/jun/01/standardlife.business\">demutualised in 2006</a> to escape a mess in endowment mortgages. Aberdeen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2005/jan/08/splitcapitalinvestmenttrusts.jobsandmoney\">went to the brink a couple of years earlier by selling split capital investment trusts</a>, a terrible financial product. Those brushes with disaster may concentrate minds on the long-term. But if happy harmony proves impossible, one man \u2013 presumably Gilbert, as Aberdeen is the junior partner \u2013 will have to fall on his fishing rod.</p> <p>On day one, though, this looks a logical deal. In an industry that is increasingly global, both sides need to be bigger and leaner. It could work.</p> <h2>PSA can\u2019t avoid politics in Vauxhall deal</h2> <p>Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Peugeot owner PSA, was full of soothing words for his British audience as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/06/peugeot-citroen-psa-group-buys-vauxhall-opel-gm-motors\">Vauxhall came under his control</a>. In a soft Brexit, the cheaper pound would boost competitiveness of the Ellesmere Port and Luton plants. A harder exit from the European single market would provide a \u201cvery nice opportunity\u201d to source more car parts inside the UK.</p> <p>Don\u2019t rely too heavily on these statements. Tavares is in the business of cutting costs and plants are always in a state of internal competition at pan-European car manufacturers to secure the next model. The Astra is safe at Ellesmere Port until 2021 but decisions on a successor will start to be made next year. The timing is awkward because the form of Brexit may not be clear by then.</p> <p>Consider Taveres\u2019 \u201cnice opportunity\u201d an appeal for the UK government to fund a re-arming of the UK supplier base. Ellesmere Port imports 75% of its parts. To enjoy the benefits of a cheaper pound, the ratio might have to fall below 50%. There is indeed an attractive opening there for UK firms, but it may require government to push the market harder and faster that it would move on its own. Politics is never far away in the car business.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Walk around the Cheshire town of Ellesmere Port and it is hard to find a person who does not know someone who has worked for Vauxhall. All seem unsurprised by Monday\u2019s announcement that PSA Group is to buy the company. Kirsty Butler, 27, who is out shopping with her two children, says she is used to hearing about threats to the future of the Vauxhall plant, which employs about 2,000 people. \u201cI read about a guy who had worked there for 26 years and was told his job was at risk every single year,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll close it. It would be a daft move.\u201d The Vauxhall Motors factory in Ellesmere Port opened in 1962, bringing workers to newly built housing estates in the town. At its peak in 1974, the plant employed 12,000 people and employees travelled in by train from Liverpool and north Wales. The future of the plant was threatened in 2012 when General Motors restructured its European operations, but an agreement to build new Astra cars promised to secure the jobs of the site\u2019s employees until 2020. Sitting in a covered market hall in the town, 74-year-old Dave Small is enjoying a cup of tea with friends. He used to work at Vauxhall and says his main concern when he heard the news was whether pensions would be protected. \u201cI worked there between 1965 and 1975 before taking the golden handshake [redundancy] and going to work on the rigs,\u201d he says. He feels that German workers at Opel will fare much better from the takeover. \u201cThe German unions are very forceful,\u201d he says. \u201cNot like ours. Not since they were smashed in the 80s.\u201d Small and his friends agree that a closure of the plant would have a devastating impact on the local area. \u201cThere are lots of little subsidiary firms supplying things like alternators and nuts to the plant and every one of them would go,\u201d he says. Eddie Ellis, 62, and wife, Jan, 59, are nervous about the effect Brexit will have on the area\u2019s dwindling industry. The area of Cheshire West and Chester voted to leave by 50.6% in the EU referendum. \u201cWe very rarely come to Ellesmere Port because there\u2019s not a lot here anymore,\u201d he says, as Jan points at a cluster of empty shops. \u201cThere are more and more charity shops opening up all the time,\u201d she says. Justin Madders, the area\u2019s MP, says there has been a threat to the plant\u2019s existence every few years ever since he can remember. \u201cPeople are well used to it and they are also well geared up to deal with that and put our best case forward,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the 1980s, we saw a real stripping out of industry [in Ellesmere Port] and, while we still do have some good quality manufacturing jobs in the area, it\u2019s nothing like the level that we used to have. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to lose any more. That\u2019s certain. Because, as we know, when these things go, they go. So we have to fight until the last to keep a presence here.\u201d At Vauxhall\u2019s Luton plant, the news of a pledge to continue production of the Vivaro van until 2025 was given a guarded welcome by workers, after weeks of speculation over the company\u2019s future. Gary Reay, the Unite union\u2019s convenor, says: \u201cThe main concern is whether the plant closes. We\u2019ve had reassurances but will treat that with caution.\u201d A flag proclaiming \u201cinvestors in people\u201d drooped from a pole above the steel gates as Vauxhall workers filed through for the lunchtime shift change. Teresa Carway, 63, arrives with bags of sweets for colleagues to mark her retirement this week after stints at Vauxhall since 1978. Then, she says, \u201cthis plant was Luton. You could walk down here and get a job straightaway.\u201d Now many workers in their 50s worry about how they would find work again, she says. Louis Whitfield, 54, has worked at the Luton plant for 17 years, putting doors on vans. \u201cAt my age, it\u2019s hard to find a new job,\u201d he says. Like many, Whitfield was here when Vauxhall\u2019s future was last in doubt, after GM looked to sell to the Canadian firm Magna. \u201cIt was doom and gloom, but we pulled through.\u201d Robert O\u2019Driscoll, 47, says: \u201cThey\u2019re saying they\u2019re going to honour our contract for eight years. But it\u2019s another two years till Brexit, which is a worry.\u201d Protecting a pension, he has paid in to for 28 years also concerns him. \u201cI\u2019ve been here since I was 19; I know nothing else.\u201d It is not only older workers who fear redundancy. James Upton, 26, says: \u201cMost places nowadays only want you for a few months. This is the one job that\u2019s actually stuck. Around here it\u2019s difficult. When you go to the jobcentre website and apply for stuff, nothing ever comes through.\u201d Joshua Taylor, 25, who has spent three years in the paint shop, found out about the PSA takeover on Facebook. He says: \u201cI looked up other plants Peugeot have bought and it doesn\u2019t look promising.\u201d Vauxhall has been at Luton since 1905. Gavin Shuker, Labour MP for Luton South and a lifelong resident, said its significance remains strong. \u201cMy dad worked here, and his father before him. That\u2019s not an uncommon story in Luton.\u201d Almost 1,500 people are directly employed at the factory, with 740 more in the head office and thousands more in the supply chain. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty vital for Luton,\u201d Shuker says, adding that the plant was \u201cone of the most productive and competitive part of GM\u2019s business\u201d, but Brexit had raised uncertainty. \u201cIt\u2019s the assurances we can\u2019t give that are the tricky ones. It\u2019s with Boris Johnson and Theresa May \u2013 that\u2019s where this story goes next,\u201d he says.",

      "bodyText": "Parcelforce couriers who deliver packages for Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis and Hamleys can be charged up to \u00a3250 a day if they are off sick and cannot find someone to cover their shift. Details of the policy applied by the Royal Mail-owned business emerged days after rival courier company DPD was criticised for charging some drivers who take time off for illness. And it will fuel concerns about precarious working conditions in the \u201cgig economy\u201d, amid a series of disputes about the employment status of people who work for firms such as Uber and Deliveroo. About a quarter of Parcelforce\u2019s 3,000 couriers are self-employed owner-drivers, meaning they are paid per delivery and must fund their own vehicle, fuel, insurance and uniform. It has emerged that some owner-drivers who take a day off due to illness, but cannot find cover, are being told they must pay Parcelforce \u00a3250 per day missed. The sum is meant to cover the cost of finding a replacement courier. Parcelforce\u2019s self-employed couriers typically earn about \u00a3200 for a shift of 12 hours or more, meaning the added penalty can see them lose out on \u00a3450 a day if they are ill. One courier, who asked not to be named for fear of being blacklisted, said drivers were being unfairly punished for illness, while many felt unable to take any holidays. \u201cWe all hate it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy colleague handed in his notice after being told he was being fined \u00a3750 for being off sick for three days.\u201d He added: \u201cIf we\u2019re off sick, we don\u2019t get any payment at all but we still have the same costs, apart from fuel. \u201cWe have to pay for the van and insurance and there is also the threat hanging over us that if we don\u2019t cover our contracted area, they say we have to cover their costs in bringing in agency drivers to cover the work that we don\u2019t do. We then get charged \u00a3250 a day.\u201d The courier said the decision on whether to charge sick drivers was \u201centirely at management discretion\u201d, meaning some drivers are penalised while others are not. He added: \u201cThe manager suggested to me that maybe five or six of us should get together and employ someone off our own back to cover our runs if we\u2019re off sick.\u201d The courier said he typically earns about \u00a3600 a week before tax, once the cost of fuel and insurance is taken into account. Parcelforce organises the rota patterns for its self-employed drivers and also requires that they undergo three days\u2019 unpaid training. Parcelforce parent Royal Mail, which was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2013 and is no longer government-owned, made a profit of \u00a3742m last year. In a statement, Parcelforce said: \u201cAt Parcelforce, around 75% of drivers are employees with the remaining 25% owner-drivers, who are contracted on a self-employment basis. Self-employed owner drivers working with Parcelforce can expect average earnings from \u00a345,000 to \u00a370,000 per annum.\u201d \u201cAs self-employed subcontractors, they are contracted to ensure the services are provided but not to provide them personally. Many owner-drivers do not actually do the route themselves, but employ someone to do it for them. Self-employed owner-drivers agree to cover the cost of fulfilling their routes if they are unable to do it themselves and are unable to provide cover. Parcelforce ensures that collections and deliveries are carried out and that customer service levels are met.\u201d Frank Field MP, who chairs the House of Commons work and pensions committee, said: \u201cIt almost looks as though some companies are now engaged in a bidding war, to see who can slap the biggest penalty on workers who are sick. \u201cAgain it goes to show how badly we need a national minimum level of decency to be enforced in the gig economy, alongside a national living wage, so that workers aren\u2019t ripped off by the companies they work with.\u201d The details of Parcelforce\u2019s contract with self-employed workers comes amid political pressure over the status of gig economy workers, with employment lawyers due to give evidence before MPs on the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy select committee on Tuesday. A series of high-profile cases has prompted Theresa May to launch an independent review of employment status in the UK. The chair of the review, former Tony Blair adviser Matthew Taylor, warned last month that precarious employment terms were becoming an increasing cause for concern. \u201cThe fact that too many workers feel that they have no control and no voice contributes to the quantum of misery and anger in British society,\u201d he said. Last week the ride-hailing app Uber was granted the right to appeal against an employment tribunal ruling that its drivers were not self-employed, but were workers. If upheld, it will mean Uber must pay the minimum wage, sick pay and holiday pay. Courier companies have come under particular scrutiny, with Hermes and DPD both in the spotlight over the terms of their contracts. Delivery company DPD charges self-employed drivers \u00a3150 if they can\u2019t work due to illness, the Guardian revealed last week. Hermes has also fielded a legal challenge from workers who dispute its classification of them as self-employed. And drivers for takeaway delivery company Deliveroo have fought back against contract terms that prevented them from seeking staff member status through the courts.",

On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s more from Greg Clark\u2019s comments on the Vauxhall deal made earlier in parliament, courtesy PA: Clark said the sale was linked to a wider restructuring of General Motors rather than Brexit. When asked whether all automotive companies would get the same deal as Nissan, he added: \u201cWe\u2019ve said that by being part of the UK automotive sector, all of the benefits of that in terms of research and development, in terms of trading, in terms of the expansion we see through the industrial strategy of the supply chain, will be available to all such companies.\u201d He added: \u201cThe fact that plants are going to be judged, as they tend to be in the automotive sector for new models, on the basis of their competitive efficiency is a strength for us in this country, because our automotive plants are the strongest in the world.\u201d Back with market reaction to the deal. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Markets know that when PSA CEO Carlos Tavares talks about synergies, he means job cuts. PSA were likely in the \u201cdriver\u2019s seat\u201d in negotiations since after a decade and a half of losses, GM clearly wanted to get shot of Opel and Vauxhall. Through the Opel brands, PSA have a new opportunity for expansion in China, where French car brands have not been so popular. For the moment, PSA will pay GM for intellectual property, meaning car-buyers can expect to be buying GM standards for the next few years. Eventually Vauxhall will morph into Peugeot so a big question longer term will be how many Vauxhall drivers stay loyal. From a GM shareholder perspective it\u2019s pretty cut and dry; the deal removes a loss-making division from the balance sheet and the proceeds will directly line their pockets via share repurchases. Jim Cunningham urges caution, warning that the promises made need to be kept as they have not always been in the past. Clark: I am cautiously optimistic. The commitments go in the right direction. We have to do everything we can to make sure [a positive future for the car industry] is achieved. And with that the house moves on to the Fox bid for Sky which is being covered in our politics live blog here: Geoffrey Robinson says the reassurances are very limited in extent and duration, and he refers to the closure of the plant at Ryton, adding that the only reassurance that counts is getting replacement models in the UK and the government should push for this. Clark says we do need to stay engaged and make sure these commitments are delivered. It is important these commitments have been given, and in writing. It is a different management now {to the time when Ryton was closed] and the strategy is not based on closing plants. Alistair Burt, wants assurances that jobs in the supply chain are secure. Clark says both the direct workforce and supply chain part of our discussions. [This is] an opportunity to expand the supply chain. Shadow minister Rebecca Long Bailey says workers will be worried about the future of their jobs, and what assurances are there on the Vauxhall plant beyond the existing contracts. Will the production of the new Astra model take place in the UK? With the GM pension deficit, are pensions guaranteed in full? The government has little power in takeovers - are there any plans to broaden the definition of public interest in takeovers. What support was offered to PSA following Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union? Greg Clark says these have been worrying times for the workforce. [But] the statements made have been welcomed, not just by me, by trade unions. The company has said it will honour agreements they have, at least to 2021. Both principal models in UK are early in the cycle. On pensions, they have given an absolute commitment no pensioner will be worse off. The pensions regulator is also required to confirm any changes in arrangements. As for the takoever regime, this is one overseas company taking over another. But we have agreed with our French and German [counterparts] that we should take a consistent approach. As for support available for automotive sector: we hope future owners will take part in support available. Greg Clark, business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, is answering questions in parliament on the Vauxhall takeover. He said the discussions which have taken place can give confidence to the Vauxhall workforce now and for the future. \u201cWe are determined [Vauxhall cars] should continue to be made [here] for many years to come.\u201d He said there had been a number of important commitments made: the new owners will honour existing agreements with the workforce; pensioners will be in at least as good a position in future as they are today; the UK division will be treated the same as other parts of the business; they will build on existing agreements and not plant closures. General Motors shares have opened lower in early US trading following the deal to sell Opel-Vauxhall to Peugeot. They are currently down 0.5%, worse than the 0.2% decline on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The overall market has been hit by a number of new concerns, not least the launch of four missiles by North Korea and Donald Trump\u2019s accusations that his were tapped on the orders of Barack Obama. PA also has more comments from Vauxhall workers arriving for work: Workers clocking in for their afternoon shift at Luton\u2019s Vauxhall plant reacted with a mix of emotions to news of the company\u2019s sale to French group PSA. Many staff who were yet to start their shift said they only heard about it on the news or online, not from their employer. Paintshop worker Joshua Taylor, 25, expressed uncertainty over job security, saying: \u201cNo-one actually knows what\u2019s going on. We haven\u2019t been told if our jobs are safe. \u201cI looked over the plants Peugeot bought and it doesn\u2019t look promising.\u201d James Upton, 26, who has worked at the plant for two years, said: \u201cI\u2019ve had jobs before but this is the one that\u2019s actually stuck. \u201cAround here, it\u2019s kind of difficult when you go on the Jobcentre websites and you apply for loads of stuff but nothing ever really comes through, and you think \u2018I have to go further afield\u2019.\u201d He said he does not know much about the deal, and described the arrangement by the French car giant as \u201ccoming at you fast\u201d. Asked about the mood among his colleagues, he said: \u201cI haven\u2019t gone in there yet to see how everyone\u2019s reacting but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be the same as always. \u201cAs long as people get paid, they\u2019re happy.\u201d Teresa Carway, 63, is retiring at the end of the week after 39 years of service at the Luton plant, and she said the announcement \u201ccouldn\u2019t have come at a better time for me\u201d. However she said other colleagues who are coming up to their retirement are concerned. She said: \u201cI think a lot of people are worried because the average age around here is 52 or 53. But if they could get another five, six years out of here, then they can retire.\u201d Mrs Carway, who works in the bodyshop assembling bolts on van doors, was hopeful for newer staff \u201c(The plant) have taken on loads of new workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken on around 300 young workers in the last year.\u201d More from the prime minister\u2019s spokesman on Vauxhall, courtesy the Press Association: Mrs May\u2019s official spokesman insisted that no specific assurances had been given to Peugeot to secure the future of the UK plants. The PM had made clear to the company that she wanted the \u201clong history of success\u201d at Vauxhall to continue in this country, said the spokesman. But he added: \u201cIn terms of specific assurances - none sought, none given. \u201cWe have a stated position that we will ensure the competitiveness of this country when it comes to the supply chain, research and development and trade.\u201d Time for a quick recap, with links to the main points. General Motors has denied that job cuts are inevitable after agreeing the sale of its European operations to PSA Group. GM is offloading Britain\u2019s Vauxhall and Germany\u2019s Opel to the owner of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn, in a \u20ac2.2bn deal announced this morning. PSA has insisted that staff across its business will get a fair chance to show they can hit productivity targets. CEO Carlos Tavares told reporters in Paris that simply shutting factories down was \u201crather simplistic\u201d. Tavares also pledged to stick to existing deals with Vauxhall workers, and General Motors CEO Mary Barra also claimed that the deal was a win-win for both sides. But unions, and individual workers at Vauxhall, are concerned that jobs could be lost - especially if the plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton don\u2019t secure pledges to manufacture new models. Some industry analysts have also predicted job cuts as PSA looks to consolidate its operations. The UK government is hopeful that Vauxhall could thrive under PSA\u2019s ownership. A spokesman for Theresa May told reporters that: The prime minister set out to Ms Barra the importance of the Vauxhall brand to the UK and reiterated her desire for the jobs at both plants to be secured for the long term. Ms Barra made clear that Vauxhall would remain a British brand and that the deal would recognise and respect all agreements regarding the workforce. Both the prime minister and Ms Barra expressed their confidence that the deal had the potential to strengthen the Vauxhall brand and allow for further growth, supported by the government\u2019s Industrial Strategy and the continued strength of the automotive sector in the UK. (that\u2019s via our Politics Live blog) Local MPs have also been banging the drum, insisting that Vauxhall plants are already pretty efficient. Labour\u2019s Justin Madders, who represents Ellesmere Port, says: There is no doubt that we have some of the most efficient plants in Europe so we have a good tale to tell and we should not underestimate the positive impact on sales that having a U.K. manufacturing base brings. There should be no doubt that one of the biggest selling points to UK consumers is that Vauxhall is a British brand that supports British jobs. That is something that I know will be stressed to PSA. General Motors was adamant this morning that its European business would have broken even last year, if it wasn\u2019t for the Brexit vote. As this chart show, that didn\u2019t happen -- although GM has been clawing its way back to profitability since the financial crisis.... Vauxhall workers at Ellesmere Port arrived for work under the glare of TV cameras and photographers this morning: Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, doesn\u2019t share John Longworth\u2019s optimism that the car industry will thrive after Brexit. If the UK loses membership of the single market, and the customs union, it will also lose the \u201cfrictionless\u201d supply chain that allows components to move freely back and forth across the channel, Burke warns. He hopes that Theresa May will commit to maintaining membership of the single market and the customs union after Brexit. But if that\u2019s not possible, Unite wants the government will push the \u2018reshoring\u2019 of component makers back into the UK. Burke also pledges to hold PSA to its promise that factories don\u2019t have to close, following the \u2018fantastic\u2019 work done in recent years to make Vauxhall\u2019s plants more efficient. John Longworth, who resigned as head of the British Chambers of Commerce last year over his support for Brexit, has denied that the EU referendum vote will hurt the car industry. He tells the World At One that if Britain get a \u2018clean break\u2019 from the EU, it could potentially slap import tariffs on cars made in Europe. That would make UK-made Vauxhalls 27% cheaper than comparable models, Longworth argues, boosting domestic demand. [Except, of course, the EU would impose reciprocal tariffs, making Vauxhalls much pricier for EU customers]. Longworth also argues that Britain can use the money saved on EU budget contributions to make the UK a more attractive place for businesses, perhaps by cutting tax or encouraging investment in R&amp;D. Radio 4\u2019s The World At One is looking at the Vauxhall/Opel sale now. They\u2019ve interviewed several workers at Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port plant today. One told them: I think the deal is a good deal for General Motors and for Vauxhall themselves....but are they [PSA] going to give us a good pension, are they going to take over the General Motors pension scheme that we\u2019ve been paying into for 32 years. Is the money still there? Another employee is worried that the Brexit vote means Vauxhall factories are vulnerable if PSA decides to make cuts. If you have a French factory and a German factory and they\u2019re all in the EU and one of them\u2019s got to go, what would you say? A third predicted a \u2018devastating impact\u201d on local people and shops if the Ellesmere Port plant closed. This isn\u2019t great news for Vauxhall workers.... Here\u2019s a photo from this morning\u2019s press conference in Paris, as GM CEO Mary Barra (left) and PSA chairman Carlos Tavares (centre) shook hands on today\u2019s deal. Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann is on the right. Theresa May told General Motors yesterday that UK jobs need to be protected, as the carmaker put the finishing touches to the sale of its European arm. The prime minister gave the message to GM CEO Mary Barra, who gave some reassurances in response, according to May\u2019s office. Here\u2019s the official statement: The Prime Minister set out to Ms Barra the importance of the Vauxhall brand to the UK and reiterated her desire for the jobs at both plants to be secured for the long term. Ms Barra made clear that Vauxhall would remain a British brand and that the deal would recognise and respect all agreements regarding the workforce. Despite that reassurance, workers in Ellesmere Port are understandably concerned, as the FT\u2019s Andrew Bounds explains: Back in the eurozone.... Greece has suffered another blow in its battle to emerge from its debt crisis. New figures show that the Greek economy shrank by 1.2% in the final three months of last year. That\u2019s a very sharp decline, and much worse than the initial estimate of a 0.4% fall in GDP. It\u2019s the worst contraction since 2015, when Greek banks were closed and capital controls imposed as the country came close to leaving the eurozone. The figures undermine hopes that the Greek economy was turning the corner. Indeed, Capital Economics are worried that the EU\u2019s forecast for a growth rebound this year looks rather too optimistic. Something for the Greek government to ponder at today\u2019s cabinet meeting, where ministers will discuss a new growth strategy.... Merging Opel and Vauxhall with Peugeot and Citroen could speed up the creation of new auto technologies. So argues Matt Freeman, managing consultant at cap hpi consulting, \u201cThe greater scale the combined PSA-Opel will have for technology investment will see a step change in vehicle development, which requires not only investment in new powertrain technology, but also the development of a wind-down strategy for internal combustion engines. Better scale will also create a better negotiating position when dealing with technology providers like Apple and Microsoft.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story on the sale of Vauxhall and Opel to PSA Group, and its pledge that job cuts can be avoided: Richard Gane, director and automotive sector specialist at supply chain firm Vendigital, says this is \u201ca bad day\u201d for the UK car industry. He isn\u2019t convinced by PSA\u2019s claim that factories won\u2019t need to close, and believes the UK government needs to offer PSA some \u2018inducements\u2019 to protect Ellesmere Port and Luton. \u201cGM tried to sell Vauxhall-Opel in 2008 and these businesses have been losing money since then so today\u2019s decision to sell is not a surprise. There is great concern however, that once current production runs are completed Vauxhall\u2019s UK-based plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton could close, forcing around 4,500 redundancies. \u201cWhile it is not yet definite that the plants will close, there is clearly concern that this could happen because in the case of the Astra, for example, around 75% of components are sourced from the EU and the vast majority of the vehicles made at Ellesmere Port are sold outside the UK. If rumours are correct and PSA Group is planning to combine platforms with Peugeot\u2019s next new model, there would be a strong reason to exit the UK. Mike Hawes, chief executives of industry body SMMT, is more hopeful: \u201cThe UK is a competitive player in the automotive industry thanks to its rich heritage, record levels of productivity, skilled workforce and strong collaboration with government. The outlook for vehicle production remains positive with investment commitments made over the past few years still delivering growth. We are hopeful that this deal will provide a positive future for the plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port and the wider supply chain given their inherent advantages. We have been encouraged by the active role government has played reassuring investors of its determination to safeguard our competitiveness despite the uncertainty of Brexit.\u201d Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at car valuer Kelley Blue Book, believes selling Opel and Vauxhall makes sense for General Motors. It allows the US auto giant to focus on emerging markets such as China and India, she says: \u201cOpel/Vauxhall was a profit losing puzzle no one at GM could solve for decades, and outside forces such as Brexit and an increasingly complex regulatory environment did not help the situation. Unloading Opel/Vauxhall and the European part of the financing greatly improves GM\u2019s balance sheet, allowing investments in growing markets such as China and India and frees up capital for further expansion into ride and car sharing and autonomous vehicles. For PSA, the acquisition should provide bargaining power with its suppliers and economies of scale. But production cost savings will be challenged by the powerful labor unions of Germany, the UK and France. The Labour MP for Ellesmere Port, Justin Madders, is meeting business secretary Greg Clark today, in an attempt to secure the car plant\u2019s long-term future under Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn. Madders says the Vauxhall sale is an important test of the UK\u2019s industrial strategy. Now the new owners are in place, clearly work must begin in earnest to put UK production in the best possible position. There have been significant challenges faced in the past but thanks to great work between the union and management at Ellesmere Port those threats have been overcome so we must draw strength from previous success. There is no doubt that we have some of the most efficient plants in Europe so we have a good tale to tell and we should not underestimate the positive impact on sales that having a U.K. manufacturing base brings. There should be no doubt that one of the biggest selling points to UK consumers is that Vauxhall is a British brand that supports British jobs. That is something that I know will be stressed to PSA. With the country now facing new trading arrangements after Brexit this is the first test of the Government\u2019s commitment to supporting U.K. manufacturing in the new world. The head of the Unite Union, Len McCluskey, has confirmed that PSA has promised to stick to Vauxhall\u2019s existing commitments. That could reassure workers about their short-term future.... ....but McCluskey is also worried that the Ellesmere Port plant, which makes Vauxhall Astras, needs a plan for beyond 2021. The Press Association has the details: Len McCluskey told Sky News that the head of the PSA Group, which makes Peugeot, had given reassurances that all commitments would be honoured as part of the deal to buy General Motors\u2019 European operations, which include Vauxhall in Britain. \u201cThere is a cautious optimism,\u201d he said. \u201cBut of course the real issue is not the current products, it\u2019s about the new models and we\u2019ll be determined to make certain that the British plants have a long term future. \u201cThe current model in Ellesmere Port goes up to 2020/2021 but really it\u2019s this time next year, maybe the middle of next year, (when) we would need to secure acceptance of a new model there. That\u2019s really the challenge for all of us. Vauxhall workers in Merseyside are hopeful that the PSA takeover will work out, reports that BBC\u2019s Colletta Smith: Labour MP Angela Eagle, whose the Merseyside constituency of Wallasey includes many Vauxhall workers, has tweeted about the deal: Business Secretary Greg Clark has welcomed PSA\u2019s pledge not to rip-up existing deals with Vauxhall\u2019s workers. He says: \u201cVauxhall has a long history of success in this country and we are determined to see that continue. The Government welcomes the assurance by PSA that they will respect the commitments made by GM to Vauxhall\u2019s employees and pensioners. The UK government will work with PSA to ensure that it keeps that promise, Clark adds. The Prime Minister and I have been in close contact with the PSA Group and General Motors and they have been clear this deal is an opportunity to grow the Vauxhall brand, building on their existing strengths and commitments. The Peugeot-Citroen press conference is now over...here\u2019s some instant reaction from industry experts. Finally, PSA gets a question about Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.... Q: What impact will Brexit have on this deal? Carlos Tavares says that no-one knows how Brexit is going to unfold, but the key issue is the trade relationships that Britain has with Europe. If you think deeply about the two scenarios -either it\u2019s hard or soft. If it\u2019s a soft Brexit, then the focus is simply on performance - being competitive in the UK versus other countries. In that set-up, the cheaper pound could boost competitiveness. If it is a hard Brexit - it will be \u201ca very nice opportunity\u201d to source more car parts from inside the UK, Tavares continues. That would allow Vauxhall to record more of its costs in sterling, bringing them in line with revenues. This means that the UK supplier base needs to be developed....something that the UK government \u201ctotally understands\u201d, Tavares says. Journalists in Paris are pressing Peugeot-Citreon about the fears of job cuts. Q: What guarantees can PSA give to workers at Opel and Vauxhall? Carlos Tavares promises that all existing agreements with unions at the two car companies will be honoured. This is not tactical, this is ethics. If there is a deal, we will respect it. But what about the future, when those agreements expire? Tavares repeats his line about giving workers a chance to improve efficiencies. Q: Can you achieve the planned efficiency savings without cutting staff? Tavares says the targets aren\u2019t based on cutting jobs. Instead, it is based on allowing \u201ctalented and creative\u201d staff to show their potential. We will offer workers a European benchmark which they can compare themselves to, Tavares adds. ITV\u2019s Joel Hills gets the microphone. Q: General Motors is taking a \u20ac4.5bn write-down on this deal - isn\u2019t that a sign that it was keen to get out of Europe? GM\u2019s Mary Barra reiterates that this deal is an \u201copportunity to strengthen the business\u201d and help GM to stay competitive. Q: Can Peugeot-Citreon make this deal work without closing factories? PSA\u2019s Carlos Tavares says that PSA hasn\u2019t shut a factory since he took control of the company. Shutting down a plant is \u201crather simplistic\u201d, Tavares continues. His philosophy is that if you trust people, they will come up with ideas and solutions that you wouldn\u2019t have thought off. But for that to happen, workforce and managers must believe that they are being given a chance. Tavares concludes: Everyone will have a chance to reach the benchmark of efficiency. As we progress towards that benchmark of efficiency, we do not need to shut down plants. Q: What does this deal mean for PSA\u2019s existing factories in Spain? Speaking in French, Carlos Tavares says the Spanish factories have improved their performance in recent years. PSA has \u201cnothing to hide\u201d, he insists. Colleagues across the company have \u201clegitimate\u201d questions over whether their jobs are protected, he adds - and he reiterates that the answer is to be as efficient and productive as possible. Q: PSA will have 19 factories once this deal goes through. Will you keep them all open? PSA\u2019s Carlos Taraves doesn\u2019t make any promises -- instead, he signals that car workers hold their future in their own hands. We believe that people understand that the only thing that protects them is the ability to be at the right level of performance, Taraves says. As a company that had a \u201cnear-death\u201d experience four year ago, we know that \u201cthe only thing that protects us is performance\u201d, Taraves adds. Onto questions... Q: Did the election of Donald Trump influence GM\u2019s decision to sell its European operations? Mary Barra replies that that deal is based on business logic, not political issues. Now the head of Opel, Karl-Thomas Neumann, speaks, and also sound optimistic abotu the sale to PSA. He says the deal will create a \u201cEuropean champion\u201d, with Opel remaining a true German brand, and Vauxhall remaining a true British brand. Mary Barra is followed by GM\u2019s president, Dan Ammann. He says GM found it hard to grow its market share in Europe, despite making improvements at Opel and Vauxhall. Shares in PSA Group have jumped by 4% in early trading, as investors give the deal the thumbs-up. More from Mary Barra: GM\u2019s Mary Barra is also attending the PSA press conference in Paris. She joins Carlos Tavares on the stage now.... Barra says the deal will put Opel and Vauxhall on a firmer footing for the future, and create a new era for the two companies. She admits that it wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but says GM is convinced that the sale is the right decision for customers, workers and shareholders. Barra also argues that GM Europe would have hit its goal of breaking even in 2016 \u201cif it wasn\u2019t for Brexit\u201d. PSA\u2019s chairman, Carlos Tavares, tells journalists in Paris that today\u2019s deal will create \u201ccreate a new European automotive champion\u201d and unleash the full potential of Vauxhall and Opel. Tavares insists that PSA is committed to both brands. In conclusion, this deal is a game-changed for PSA, Tavares adds. You can also watch the PSA press conference on Periscope, here: Over in Paris, PSA Group is holding a press conference to discuss the Vauxhall/Opel deal. It\u2019s being streamed live here (in English). The Vauxhall-Opel sale isn\u2019t the only big deal announced this morning. Standard Life has just swooped on fellow insurance group Aberdeen Asset Management in an \u00a311bn takeover. Standard Life\u2019s shares have surged by 9% in early trading, while Aberdeen are up 6.5%. But while the City likes the tie-up, staff at both companies may be fearing for their future, with \u00a3200m of cost-cuts planned. Here\u2019s my colleague Julia Kollewe\u2019s take: Here\u2019s a bit of UK car history -- the first Vauxhall Viva rolling off the production line at the Ellesmere Port factory, back in 1964. Politicians in Germany and Britain have been scrambling to protect workers at Opel and Vauxhall, respectively, in anticipation of this morning\u2019s deal. City analyst Louise Cooper fears that British workers could be vulnerable. She suspects that Paris government, which holds a stake in PSA, won\u2019t want to spare Britain from the cost-cutting. Sky\u2019s Darren McCaffrey is also concerned that workers in Luton or Ellesmere Port, in Cheshire, could be hit. Labour MP Gavin Shuker, who represents Luton South, has welcomed the end to the uncertainty over Vauxhall\u2019s future. Shuker also points out that Vauxhall\u2019s factories are more efficient than most of PSA\u2019s other operations -- a reason not to consider closing them.... Here\u2019s the official annoucement: Opel/Vauxhall to join PSA Group General Motor\u2019s CEO, Mary Barra, says this deal will help GM to focus on new technologies (probably including self-driving cars?). \u201cWe are reshaping our company and delivering consistent, record results for our owners through disciplined capital allocation to our higher-return investments in our core automotive business and in new technologies that are enabling us to lead the future of personal mobility. Barra also argues that Opel and Vauxhall will be in \u201can even stronger position for the long term\u201d. PSA\u2019s chairman, Carlos Tavares, is trying to reassure Vauxhall and Opel workers about the future. Speaking as the deal is announced, Tavaras says: \u201cWe are proud to join forces with Opel/Vauxhall and are deeply committed to continuing to develop this great company and accelerating its turnaround. We respect all that Opel/Vauxhall\u2019s talented people have achieved as well as the company\u2019s fine brands and strong heritage. We intend to manage PSA and Opel/Vauxhall capitalizing on their respective brand identities. Having already created together winning products for the European market, we know that Opel/Vauxhall is the right partner. We see this as a natural extension of our relationship and are eager to take it to the next level.\u201d \u201cWe are confident that the Opel/Vauxhall turnaround will significantly accelerate with our support, while respecting the commitments made by GM to the Opel/Vauxhall employees.\u201d But....PSA is also adamant that it will make cost-savings once the deal goes through.... It says: The transaction will allow substantial economies of scale and synergies in purchasing, manufacturing and R&amp;D. Annual synergies of \u20ac1.7 Bn are expected by 2026 \u2013 of which a significant part is expected to be delivered by 2020, accelerating Opel/Vauxhall\u2019s turnaround It\u2019s official - General Motors is pulling out of the European car market by selling its Vauxhall and Opel divisions in a \u20ac2.2bn (\u00a31.9bn) deal. The agreement, announced a few minutes ago, will see France\u2019s PSA Group (the firm behind Peugeot and Citroen) take ownership of Germany\u2019s Opel and Britain\u2019s Vauxhall. It ends weeks of speculation over the future of both car brands, and will make PSA Europe\u2019s second-largest automotive company, with 17% of the market. But it also means fresh uncertainty for workers at Vauxhall\u2019s two British plants, at Ellesmere Port and Luton, if PSA decides to cut costs. Details and reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a lot afoot this morning, starting with the car industry, as General Motors seals a deal to sell its Opel and Vauxhall divisions to France\u2019s PSA. In the UK, two of Scotland\u2019s biggest companies \u2013 Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management \u2013 are on track to merge, creating the second biggest fund manager in Europe.

Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets know that when PSA CEO Carlos Tavares talks about synergies, he means job cuts. PSA were likely in the \u201cdriver\u2019s seat\u201d in negotiations since after a decade and a half of losses, GM clearly wanted to get shot of Opel and Vauxhall. Through the Opel brands, PSA have a new opportunity for expansion in China, where French car brands have not been so popular.</p> <p>For the moment, PSA will pay GM for intellectual property, meaning car-buyers can expect to be buying GM standards for the next few years. Eventually Vauxhall will morph into Peugeot so a big question longer term will be how many Vauxhall drivers stay loyal. From a GM shareholder perspective it\u2019s pretty cut and dry; the deal removes a loss-making division from the balance sheet and the proceeds will directly line their pockets via share repurchases.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-06T16:40:05.038Z\">at 4.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58bd89cae4b047c20d905f5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-06T16:20:26.472Z\">4.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Jim Cunningham urges caution, warning that the promises made need to be kept as they have not always been in the past.</em></p> <p>Clark: I am cautiously optimistic.

There is great concern however, that once current production runs are completed Vauxhall\u2019s UK-based plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton could close, forcing around 4,500 redundancies.</p> <p>\u201cWhile it is not yet definite that the plants will close, there is clearly concern that this could happen because in the case of the Astra, for example, around 75% of components are sourced from the EU and the vast majority of the vehicles made at Ellesmere Port are sold outside the UK. If rumours are correct and PSA Group is planning to combine platforms with Peugeot\u2019s next new model, there would be a strong reason to exit the UK.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Mike Hawes,</strong> chief executives of industry body<strong> SMMT, </strong>is more hopeful:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe UK is a competitive player in the automotive industry thanks to its rich heritage, record levels of productivity, skilled workforce and strong collaboration with government. The outlook for vehicle production remains positive with investment commitments made over the past few years still delivering growth.</p> <p>We are hopeful that this deal will provide a positive future for the plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port and the wider supply chain given their inherent advantages.

There is no doubt that we have some of the most efficient plants in Europe so we have a good tale to tell and we should not underestimate the positive impact on sales that having a U.K. manufacturing base brings.

      "bodyText": "The world will be hit by sharp increase in oil prices in the next decade without a major investment in new fields, one of the world\u2019s leading energy authorities has warned. The International Energy Agency said after a two year-slump the industry was making a weak recovery, which would coincide with India and China continuing to drive up oil demand. The result would be a tight market and surge in oil prices towards 2022 without further action, the IEA concluded in a report. Oil majors such as BP and Shell have been cautiously upbeat about the number of final investment decisions they will take on new projects this year, buoyed by an oil price that has settled at about $55 (\u00a345) a barrel after the biggest oil-producing countries agreed to curb production last December. Last week Shell made a final investment decision to proceed on a Gulf of Mexico deepwater project, the first such approval it had made in more than 18 months. But the IEA called the industry\u2019s recovery modest and said at current rates it would not be enough to catch up on a backlog of lost investment in the last two years, when it fell by a quarter annually because of low oil prices. \u201cIn 2015 and 2016 investment in the upstream oil industry has been at record lows. It\u2019s not recovering significantly in 2017,\u201d said Neil Atkinson, one of the report\u2019s authors. He said hundreds of billions of dollars of extra investment was needed to avoid a crunch. The Paris-based organisation said it was surprised oil markets were so sanguine about the risk of too few new projects being confirmed. Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cThis is no time for complacency. We don\u2019t see a peak in oil demand any time soon. And unless investments globally rebound sharply, a new period of price volatility looms on the horizon.\u201d The US would take the number one slot worldwide for oil supply growth in the next five years, the agency predicted. That increase would be driven not by Donald Trump\u2019s pro-oil energy policy \u2013 which the IEA expected would take time to have an impact \u2013 but from continuing success for low-cost, shale oil drillers. The next two fastest-growing oil suppliers are expected to be Canada and Brazil. Inside the Opec, the bulk of new supplies is anticipated to come from Iraq, the UAE and Iran, though that could be affected by the wild card of further sanctions on the latter. The agency said although there was some uncertainty over supplies, the picture on demand was clearer. With the IMF expecting economic growth of 3.7% a year, the IEA said oil demand would grow 1.2% up to 2022, with China and India accounting for half of new demand alone. Demand is expected to pass the symbolic milestone of 100 million barrels per day in 2019, up from 96.6mb/d last year. The developing world\u2019s hunger for oil was one reason the situation today was different to the last time oil exploration investment collapsed so severely, in the early 1980s, the IEA said. Atkinson, the IEA\u2019s head of oil industry and markets division, said: \u201cGlobal oil demand [in the early 1980s] fell three years in a row. There was lot of spare capacity around, so companies cut back in investment. Today we are in situation where oil demand is expected to continue to grow.\u201d The impact of electric cars, which some analysts have predicted will seriously erode future growth in oil demand, is seen as negligible by the IEA. \u201cWhile the much-discussed growth in the electric vehicles fleet is a very important longer term issue for oil demand, by 2022 we estimate that only limited volumes of global transport fuel demand will be lost to electric vehicles from conventional fuels,\u201d the report said. In the UK, the expectation is that the oil production growth seen in the past two years will go into decline, before picking up next year as large projects such as BP\u2019s Clair Ridge and Quad 204 developments in the North Sea start up. Those two alone will add about a 10th to the UK\u2019s annual oil production when fully operational.",

The result would be a tight market and surge in oil prices towards 2022 without further action, the IEA concluded in a report.</p> <p>Oil majors such as BP and Shell have been cautiously upbeat about the number of final investment decisions they will take on new projects this year, buoyed by an oil price that has settled at about $55 (\u00a345) a barrel after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/12/oil-price-surges-opec-non-opec-agree-deal-cut-output\">the biggest oil-producing countries agreed to curb production last December</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2017-03-06T15:01:14/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Global oil demand v supply\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2017-03-06T15:01:14/embed.html\">Global oil demand v supply</a> <figcaption>Global oil demand v supply</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2017/kaikias-deep-water-project-in-the-gulf-of-mexico.html\">Shell made a final investment decision to proceed on a Gulf of Mexico deepwater </a>project, the first such approval it had made in more than 18 months.</p> <p>But the IEA called the industry\u2019s recovery modest and said at current rates it would not be enough to catch up on a backlog of lost investment in the last two years, when it fell by a quarter annually because of low oil prices.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2015 and 2016 investment in the upstream oil industry has been at record lows. It\u2019s not recovering significantly in 2017,\u201d said Neil Atkinson, one of the report\u2019s authors. He said hundreds of billions of dollars of extra investment was needed to avoid a crunch.</p> <p>The Paris-based organisation said it was surprised oil markets were so sanguine about the risk of too few new projects being confirmed. </p> <p>Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cThis is no time for complacency. We don\u2019t see a peak in oil demand any time soon. And unless investments globally rebound sharply, a new period of price volatility looms on the horizon.\u201d</p> <p>The US would take the number one slot worldwide for oil supply growth in the next five years, the agency predicted. That increase would be driven not by Donald Trump\u2019s pro-oil energy policy \u2013 which the IEA expected would take time to have an impact \u2013 but from continuing success for low-cost, shale oil drillers. </p> <p>The next two fastest-growing oil suppliers are expected to be Canada and Brazil. Inside the Opec, the bulk of new supplies is anticipated to come from Iraq, the UAE and Iran, though that could be affected by the wild card of further sanctions on the latter.</p> <p>The agency said although there was some uncertainty over supplies, the picture on demand was clearer. With the IMF expecting economic growth of 3.7% a year, the IEA said oil demand would grow 1.2% up to 2022, with China and India accounting for half of new demand alone. Demand is expected to pass the symbolic milestone of 100 million barrels per day in 2019, up from 96.6mb/d last year.</p> <p>The developing world\u2019s hunger for oil was one reason the situation today was different to the last time oil exploration investment collapsed so severely, in the early 1980s, the IEA said.</p> <p>Atkinson, the IEA\u2019s head of oil industry and markets division, said: \u201cGlobal oil demand [in the early 1980s] fell three years in a row.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of the French company behind Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn has vowed to turn Opel and Vauxhall around without factory closures or job cuts, after agreeing to buy General Motors\u2019 lossmaking European arm for \u20ac2.2bn (\u00a31.9bn). The acquisition of Opel/Vauxhall, which generated revenues of \u20ac17.7bn last year, will transform PSA Group into the second-biggest carmaker in Europe, after Volkswagen. PSA\u2019s chief executive, Carlos Tavares, talked of creating a \u201cEuropean champion\u201d. He pointed to the French company\u2019s track record and said employees at Vauxhall in the UK and Opel in Germany would be given a chance to reach the necessary \u201cbenchmark\u201d of efficiency. GM and PSA said the deal would create annual savings of \u20ac1.7bn in purchasing, manufacturing, and research and development by 2026, with most savings likely to be achieved by 2020 from purchasing. Tavares said the estimate did not include any job cuts. He told a press conference in Paris: \u201cWe do not need to shut down plants \u2026 We believe we need to trust the talents of people. They always come up with ideas and solutions we could not imagine \u2026 Shutting down plants is rather simplistic.\u201d Tavares stressed that he had not closed a single factory since he took over at PSA in 2014. The carmaker, which came close to bankruptcy and was bailed out by the French government and Chinese investors, shut a French factory just before the former Nissan executive took the helm. Tavares reiterated that he would honour previous agreements GM made with unions at Opel and Vauxhall, suggesting that jobs at Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port and Luton factories would be safe until 2020. His assurances also suggest production of the current Vauxhall Astra at Ellesmere Port will be guaranteed until 2021, while the Vivaro van in Luton would be guaranteed until 2025. The Unite union said talks on a new model to replace the Astra would need to begin by late 2018. GM\u2019s chief executive, Mary Barra, said without last summer\u2019s Brexit vote, Opel and Vauxhall would have moved into profit last year. She described the deal as a \u201cwin-win\u201d for all three companies. Opel/Vauxhall sold 1.16m cars in Europe last year, up 4.1%, giving it a 5.7% share of the market. About half of Opel\u2019s 38,200-member workforce are in Germany. The carmaker, which was founded by Adam Opel in R\u00fcsselsheim in 1862, has plants there, including a big R&amp;D centre where 7,700 people work, as well as in Kaiserslautern and Eisenach in east Germany. Tavares, Barra and the Opel chief, Karl-Thomas Neumann, will address Opel workers in R\u00fcsselsheim this afternoon, a session that will be broadcast to other factories. Tavares will then fly to Switzerland for the Geneva motor show. Vauxhall employs about 4,600 people at Ellesmere Port and Luton, with a further 20,000 working in the carmaker\u2019s showrooms; they also support a further 18,000 supply chain jobs. Tavares said in a soft Brexit scenario, the cheaper pound could boost Vauxhall\u2019s competitiveness, and if the UK left the EU\u2019s single market in a hard Brexit scenario, it would be a \u201cvery nice opportunity\u201d to source more car parts from inside the UK, so costs and revenues were recorded in sterling. This would mean the UK supplier base needed to be developed, something the UK government \u201ctotally understands\u201d, Tavares said. Len McCluskey, head of Unite union, said Vauxhall workers had endured a \u201cnerve-racking\u201d few weeks and needed assurances over the long-term future of the factories. He said: \u201cOur plants are the most productive in the European operation. The brand is strong here, the market for the products is here, so the cars must be made here.\u201d Most of Opel/Vauxhall\u2019s European and UK pension plans will remain with GM, with the exception of the German pension fund and some smaller plans, which will be transferred to PSA. GM will pay PSA \u20ac3bn for full settlement of the pension obligations. It appears that all Vauxhall pensions will be kept under GM. Vauxhall\u2019s pension plan has a deficit of \u00a31bn while the Opel pension deficit is estimated at nearly \u20ac7bn. The long-awaited announcement of the deal is expected to trigger a political battle between the French, German and UK governments to protect jobs and factories in their countries. Greg Clark, the UK business secretary, said: \u201cVauxhall has a long history of success in this country and we are determined to see that continue. The government welcomes the assurance by PSA that they will respect the commitments made by GM to Vauxhall\u2019s employees and pensioners. \u201cWe will continue to engage and work with PSA in the weeks and months ahead to ensure these assurances are kept and will build on the success of both sites for the long term. The prime minister and I have been in close contact with the PSA Group and General Motors and they have been clear this deal is an opportunity to grow the Vauxhall brand, building on their existing strengths and commitments.\u201d The Labour MP for Ellesmere Port, Justin Madders, is meeting Clark on Monday, and said the Vauxhall takeover was an important test of the UK\u2019s industrial strategy. He added: \u201cThere should be no doubt that one of the biggest selling points to UK consumers is that Vauxhall is a British brand that supports British jobs. That is something that I know will be stressed to PSA.\u201d The Liberal Democrats warned that jobs were still far from safe at Vauxhall. Its leader Tim Farron said: \u201cThere are bound to be cutbacks, and with the British government unable to guarantee car makers they will have access to the single market post-Brexit, the danger is that jobs will be cut in the UK rather than in Germany or France.\u201d Japanese carmaker Nissan has cast some doubt over its long-term commitment to the UK, and BMW might start making the British Mini in Germany. Labour MP Gavin Shuker, who represents Luton South, said: \u201cGlad to see the uncertainty over the PSA/GM deal is now over. Our UK plants are among the most efficient of any in the new company. They deserve a bright future. Now government needs to play its part, delivering a Brexit deal that keeps Vauxhall building in the UK.\u201d Labour MP Angela Eagle, whose Merseyside constituency of Wallasey includes many Vauxhall workers, tweeted about the deal: The deal is expected to close towards the end of this year and needs approval from antitrust authorities.",

The carmaker, which came close to bankruptcy and was bailed out by the French government and Chinese investors, shut a French factory just before the former Nissan executive took the helm. <br></p> <p>Tavares reiterated that he would honour previous agreements GM made with unions at Opel and Vauxhall, suggesting that jobs at Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port and Luton factories would be safe until 2020. </p> <p>His assurances also suggest production of the current <a href=\"http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/vauxhall/astra\">Vauxhall Astra</a> at Ellesmere Port will be guaranteed until 2021, while the <a href=\"http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/vauxhall/vivaro\">Vivaro</a> van in Luton would be guaranteed until 2025.

      "bodyText": "The resources minister, Matt Canavan, says adopting a national policy where a proportion of natural gas would be reserved for domestic use would not deliver \u201ca very good outcome\u201d because rationing doesn\u2019t work in other markets. Canavan, a Queensland National, used a steak analogy on Monday to make his point. He said Australian beef producers currently exported a significant quantity of steak, and that practice didn\u2019t create a domestic shortage of prime cuts in butchers and supermarkets. \u201cWe don\u2019t make sure we have enough scotch fillet in the supermarket by telling farmers they can\u2019t sell their beef or cattle to overseas markets,\u201d the resources minister told Sky News on Monday. \u201cWe let them sell to a wide range of markets which gives them confidence to invest which gives them a good return when they can get a good price \u2013 and we have plenty of steak.\u201d A shortage of gas in eastern Australia, and surging prices, has reignited public debate about whether a portion of gas supply should be quarantined for domestic use. Currently in Western Australia, 15% of the gas produced by each liquefied natural gas project must be kept for domestic purposes. Canavan\u2019s comments on Sky News follow a call last week from the Victorian Nationals MP Andrew Broad, for serious consideration about whether 15% of gas supply should be reserved for Australian manufacturing rather than exported. Broad, who is chairman of federal parliament\u2019s environment and energy committee, told Guardian Australia last week a national domestic gas reservation policy was worthy of serious consideration \u201cto ensure we are best using those resources to lift Australians\u2019 wealth\u201d. The WA premier, Colin Barnett, has also pushed for the WA policy to apply at the federal level. But Canavan said on Monday a domestic gas reservation policy wouldn\u2019t deliver the desired outcome. \u201cThe basic idea is you keep more of your resources here to boost domestic supplies and lower the price potentially \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t work in any other market.\u201d Using his beef analogy, Canavan said the price of steak had \u201cgone up a bit in the last few years because the world price of beef\u2019s gone up \u2013 but there\u2019s no shortage of cuts of steak in your local shops even though we export the vast majority of it overseas\u201d. \u201cThat should be no different with gas, because we have plenty of gas resources here in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cYes we are exporting a lot of it now but that actually should help increase gas investment and gas supply because it gives confidence to gas investors that they can get a return on their investments.\u201d Canavan was also asked about his previous support for subsidising a \u201cclean\u201d coal baseload power plant from the government\u2019s $5bn Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund. At the beginning of last month, the minister said the government had already been approached by an interested party eyeing off development in the Galilee Basin, the site of the controversial Adani coalmine. But on Monday Canavan said the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund had not yet been presented with a new coal power plant proposal from a commercial player. He maintained he had spoken to \u201ca number\u201d of interested parties, but no one had come forward with a worked-up proposal. Canavan said the government would consider any proposal that would \u201cstack up\u201d. \u201cWe know from studies that have been done that a coal-fired power plant in the Galilee Basin does conceptually make some sense, but clearly we will need more details before any decision is made,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should just be open to it.\u201d Officials from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation told a Senate estimates hearing last week they had been approached by proponents of a new $1.2bn coal-fired power station with carbon capture and storage technology. The ABC subsequently revealed that the interested party was Clive Palmer\u2019s Waratah Coal company, which was intent on seeking government assistance to develop a \u201cclean coal\u201d plant in the Galilee Basin. Last week, the deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, declared he wasn\u2019t interested in helping the Palmer proposal. Canavan, the minister responsible for administering the $5bn Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund, was considerably more circumspect. He said he wasn\u2019t aware of the specifics of the Palmer proposal, and he didn\u2019t intend to prejudge. The outgoing CEFC chief executive, Oliver Yates, has said new coal-fired power plants are not financeable in Australia unless the government agreed to indemnify the project against the future risk of a carbon price being introduced and against the cost of delays in the project prompted by likely community protest action.",

      "bodyText": "The presidency of Donald Trump could mark the breakdown of global trade and the division of the world into trading blocs based around currencies \u2013 forcing Australia to choose between the United States and China. That is the scenario that will be painted by Michael Every, head of financial markets Asia Pacific for Rabobank at the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (Abares) Outlook conference on Tuesday. With agricultural growth surging in Australia according to the latest national accounts, Every will suggest that, as Trump pushes a more protectionist trade policy, Australia and the world will face a very different global trade landscape. While Britain\u2019s vote to withdraw from the European Union caused shockwaves, Every believes the election of Trump could fundamentally change the trade landscape because of the world\u2019s reliance on the US currency for trade. Every says Trump is approaching the United States as a businessman and that, in the business world, it makes sense to sell more than you buy. But, in world economic terms, with the international system priced in US dollars, Every says every country will be considering who will fill the potential US dollar vacuum and, by extension, which currency is used to do so. \u201cFree trade as we understand it is under extreme pressure,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf the US doesn\u2019t run a huge trade deficit, the world trade system as we understand it today breaks down.\u201d Every believes it is highly unlikely that the world can expect to just \u201cride out Trump\u201d. \u201cPeople expecting to ride out Trump are naive,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is the leading edge of where we are going, based on what we see elsewhere too. It\u2019s a global trend, driven by weak demand and rising inequality.\u201d He said Australia, with cultural ties to the United States and economic ties to Asia, might eventually have to choose. There was no currency to rival the US dollar in Asia as yet, he said, but if Australia chose to enter an Asian trade bloc based on Chinese currency, even if it could work without the US dollar to cement it, over time that would have potential political implications. Every said it was unrealistic for Australia to step back without making a choice between China and the US at some point if present political trends were to continue. \u201cThe historical lesson is that world trade has fractured before \u2013 and we must recall that Australia is propped up under Chinese demand ... under a US security umbrella.\u201d Every said Australian farmers and exporters should prepare for exchange rate volatility, including a higher US dollar and fall in the Australian dollar by up to 15% in some scenarios, with Asian currencies falling by even more. Every said policymakers needed to be realistic and accept that selling the free trade message did not solve the underlying problems. \u201cAustralia is a naturally large food exporter and there is still naturally large food demand but the issue is going to be by what route is food going to get there.\u201d The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, will open the conference on Tuesday.",

      "body": "<p>The presidency of Donald Trump could mark the breakdown of global trade and the division of the world into trading blocs based around currencies \u2013 forcing Australia to choose between the United States and China. </p> <p>That is the scenario that will be painted by Michael Every, head of financial markets Asia Pacific for Rabobank at the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (Abares) Outlook conference on Tuesday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/hug-a-farmer-theyve-just-saved-australias-economic-bacon-20170302-gupqwl.html\">With agricultural growth surging in Australia</a> according to the latest national accounts, Every will suggest that, as Trump pushes a more protectionist trade policy, Australia and the world will face a very different global trade landscape.</p> <p>While Britain\u2019s vote to withdraw from the European Union caused shockwaves, Every believes the election of Trump could fundamentally change the trade landscape because of the world\u2019s reliance on the US currency for trade.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/10/trump-presidency-poses-threat-to-global-economy-fitch-ratimngs-agency-trade-relations\">Trump presidency poses threat to global economy, warns Fitch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Every says Trump is approaching the United States as a businessman and that, in the business world, it makes sense to sell more than you buy. But, in world economic terms, with the international system priced in US dollars, Every says every country will be considering who will fill the potential US dollar vacuum and, by extension, which currency is used to do so. </p> <p>\u201cFree trade as we understand it is under extreme pressure,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf the US doesn\u2019t run a huge trade deficit, the world trade system as we understand it today breaks down.\u201d</p> <p>Every believes it is highly unlikely that the world can expect to just \u201cride out Trump\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPeople expecting to ride out Trump are naive,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is the leading edge of where we are going, based on what we see elsewhere too. It\u2019s a global trend, driven by weak demand and rising inequality.\u201d</p> <p>He said Australia, with cultural ties to the United States and economic ties to Asia, might eventually have to choose. There was no currency to rival the US dollar in Asia as yet, he said, but if Australia chose to enter an Asian trade bloc based on Chinese currency, even if it could work without the US dollar to cement it, over time that would have potential political implications.</p> <p>Every said it was unrealistic for Australia to step back without making a choice between China and the US at some point if present political trends were to continue.</p> <p>\u201cThe historical lesson is that world trade has fractured before \u2013 and we must recall that Australia is propped up under Chinese demand ... under a US security umbrella.\u201d</p> <p>Every said Australian farmers and exporters should prepare for exchange rate volatility, including a higher US dollar and fall in the Australian dollar by up to 15% in some scenarios, with Asian currencies falling by even more.</p> <p>Every said policymakers needed to be realistic and accept that selling the free trade message did not solve the underlying problems.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia is a naturally large food exporter and there is still naturally large food demand but the issue is going to be by what route is food going to get there.\u201d </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, will open the conference on Tuesday.</p>",
