      "bodyText": "The number of tax evasion cases being pursued by HM Revenue &amp; Customs has fallen to its lowest level in five years, according to a survey which comes amid a pledge by the Liberal Democrats to crack down on individuals who are not paying their fair share of tax. Lawyers Pinsent Masons said the number of serious tax evasion cases \u2013 with more than \u00a350,000 of suspected tax evasion \u2013 had fallen by a quarter in the past year as the government prepares to hand HMRC a general anti-abuse rule from April 2013. Meanwhile the number of raids undertaken in the 2011-12 tax year has risen to 499 from 196 in the 2010-11 tax year. In 2011-12 there were 3,346 suspected tax avoidance cases, down from the 4,506 in 2010-11, according to data compiled by the law firm. Phil Berwick, director at Pinsent Masons, said: \"HMRC is now prepared to use its strongest anti-evasion measures in cases that would previously have been regarded as quite modest in size\". But, he said, the fall in the number of cases \"doesn't really gel with the idea that there is a substantial and growing threat to public spending because of tax evasion\". Lib Dem Treasury chief Danny Alexander said that anyone with assets of more than \u00a31m would face scrutiny by tax inspectors \u2013 effectively putting extra 200,000 individuals under the spotlight of HMRC's affluence unit. Business secretary Vince Cable also told another Sunday newspaper that he wanted to take action against \"shady\" rich people using offshore tax havens in a \"systematic and cynical\" way. Berwick pointed to a tough approach being taken by HMRC, using the case of Melvyn Careswell, a plumber who was jailed for 12 months for tax evasion after failing to register his earnings for five years with the tax authorities. \"A few years ago, a \u00a350,000 tax evasion case would almost certainly have been subject to civil, rather than criminal prosecution,\" Berwick said.",

The union leaders' idea was to represent the biblical saying that it is easier to thread a camel through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go to heaven. Shortly afterwards, AA was merged with Saga, already in private hands, and the enlarged Acromas was created. Goodsell was quoted in July as saying that he favoured a stock market listing of the entire company rather than any alternative.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Failed plans fall into three categories. There are good plans that are poorly executed, as in the blueprint drawn up by Count Alfred von Schlieffen for the invasion of France in 1914. There are strategically bad plans that are well executed, as in Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812. And then there's the coalition government's deficit reduction plan. Last Friday's monthly update on the public finances was grim reading for George Osborne and his Liberal Democrat sidekick Danny Alexander. Back in the happy days of 2010 the talk was of how an ambitious plan to reduce the red ink splattered all over the Treasury's books could be combined with robust growth and the protection of frontline services. Not one of these objectives has been met. The quality of public services has been diminished by job cuts, the economy has hit the wall and, perhaps most tellingly of all, the gap between what the government spends and what it receives in taxes is getting bigger, not smaller. The deficit last month was more than \u00a314bn, slightly up on the previous year and a record for any August. On budget day, the chancellor said he expected the deficit to fall by more than 4% in the current financial year; in the first five months of 2012-13 it is 21% up on 2011-12. It will take a rapid \u2013 and wholly unlikely \u2013 acceleration in growth over the next few months for Osborne to have the remotest chance of hitting his forecasts. More probably, he will have to use his autumn statement in early December to admit that he is going to break at least one of the rules he set himself for control of the public finances when he became chancellor. The target of reducing debt as a share of national income by the end of this parliament already looks fanciful given the flatlining of the economy over the past 18 months, leaving Osborne with the choice of setting a new, less onerous challenge or announcing fresh austerity plans. Humiliating though it will be, the chancellor will almost certainly take the first option. The deficit reduction plan already implies greater austerity in 2013-14 and 2014-15 than in the current financial year, and it would be a brave chancellor who would remove extra demand from an economy already fragile. The idea of expansionary fiscal contraction \u2013 getting tough with the budget boosts growth by allowing monetary policy to work its magic \u2013 has proved a dud. Why? Because the banking system is broken and the over-indebted are not interested in taking on more debt no matter how far interest rates fall. Osborne and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) have massively overestimated the power of monetary policy, so to further tighten fiscal policy would result in even weaker growth and make the government's fiscal objectives even harder to achieve. Osborne will fall back on the defence used by every chancellor since time immemorial: blame the foreigner. Had it not been for the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone, the rise in oil prices, and the sluggishness of the global economy, he will say, everything would be going swimmingly by now. There was nothing wrong with the plan. It was a super plan. It was, indeed, the only plan that could have saved Britain from Greek-style debt dystopia. It was just that other people messed things up. Sir Mervyn King is providing the chancellor with a certain amount of political cover for his U-turn. The governor of the Bank of England says it will be all right for the government to miss its debt target provided it is the result of external factors and not due to his going soft on deficit reduction itself. Given that King stood four square behind Osborne's austerity from the outset and has used the same defence for the bank's record of consistently over-estimating growth and under-estimating inflation, his support is unsurprising but welcome if it prevents Osborne from compounding his own errors. For while it is true that Labour's stewardship of the public finances left a lot to be desired in advance of the Great Crash of 2007 and that any government faced with a budget deficit of 11% of national output would be forced to take steps to balance the books, the fact is that Osborne's plan was ill-conceived, hastily drawn up, based on overly optimistic forecasts and executed in such a way as to amplify the pain felt by the public. The failings of Plan A are explored by Brian Reading in a paper for Lombard Street Research called The Blunt Axe. The title is a reference to the so-called Geddes Axe, the programme of deep spending cuts imposed in the early 1920s following close scrutiny of where savings could be made. Reading's assessment of Osborne's approach is scathing, arguing that it failed miserably to accomplish the coalition's \"urgent priority to secure economic stability at a time of continuing uncertainty in the global economy\". In particular, the paper says there was no attempt to assess the impact on growth of spending cuts, the government hid behind \"rosy forecasts\" provided by the OBR, it \"slashed and burned\" investment apart from expensive prestige projects, it made no attempt to identify where taxpayers' money was to be saved, failed to measure the real resources provided to departments given the different inflation rates that apply to services such as health, failed to protect frontline workers (or even identify what work they did), and made no plans for the inevitable cuts in public sector employment, which at 372,000 in the first two years are almost six times as high as the 66,000 estimated by the OBR. Reading concludes that there was no need for Plan A to savage growth. The coalition, he says, could have substantially boosted investment spending without breaking its own fiscal rules. Instead, net investment spending in 2014-15 is forecast to be almost 60% lower than it was five years earlier. This is not a new phenomenon. Governments of all stripes always find it easier to cut capital spending than current spending, despite the long (and often short) term consequences for the economy. Nor is Reading convinced by the argument that everything can be blamed on events on the other side of the Channel. \"The deteriorating global environment and euro-debacle undoubtedly damaged the British economy, but were foreseeable. The OBR was an accomplice, persistently awarding pass marks despite darkening skies.\" Calling for a new Geddes commission, he concludes: \"The axe was blunt, the axeman blind.\" In one respect, Osborne is right. The public finances are in a terrible mess and need to be fixed. Ed Balls will have to come up with a credible blueprint if Labour wins the next election. But what the past two and a half years have proved beyond doubt is that a deficit reduction plan without a growth plan is no deficit reduction plan at all.",
