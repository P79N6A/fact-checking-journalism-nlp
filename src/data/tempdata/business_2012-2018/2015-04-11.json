      "bodyText": "The skirt of the summer is here. Marks and Spencer\u2019s much talked about \u201cIt piece\u201d, a 1970s-style suede skirt with a price tag of \u00a3199, finally went on sale this weekend in selected stores and will be shipped to the thousands who have ordered it online. Although the skirt\u2019s official launch date is not until 14 May, the buzz around the brown pencil skirt began in February, when it was spotted on the likes of model Alexa Chung and American socialite Olivia Palermo. Since then, it has been featured in numerous fashion magazines and blogs, including Vogue and Glamour, and on runways at New York fashion week. Natalie Miles, a 35-year-old account manager at skincare brand Elemis, made a special trip to Marks\u2019s flagship Marble Arch store in London last Friday and decided that the skirt lives up to the hype. \u201cI heard about it online a few months ago and I really like the design and feel of it. M&amp;S has got a lot better in recent years and this is a really nice piece,\u201d she said. Jayne Saunders, the store\u2019s manager, agreed, adding that she was pleased with the reaction so far. \u201cOur customers have been really positive. We sold our first one within minutes of the store opening.\u201d While this is good news for M&amp;S, some shoppers were left disappointed. \u201cThey don\u2019t have it in my size,\u201d said Miles, as she looked through the rail to find it only had size 14s and above. \u201cOh well, it was a lot of money anyway.\u201d A faux suede version of the skirt has already sold out, and social media chatter has apparently drawn customers to stores. Such is the interest stoked by the skirt that it is credited by Marc Bolland, chief executive of M&amp;S, with helping the retailer to its first rise in clothing and homeware sales in almost four years, after first-quarter results saw its share price rise by more than 5%. A spokesperson for M&amp;S said: \u201cWe offered customers the opportunity to register their interest in the skirt, to be notified when it is available, and several thousand registered. It attracted so much attention the store brought forward a limited first drop to this weekend. This is a great example of how our interpretation of the key catwalk trends has landed well with customers and the fashion media.\u201d Queralt Ferrer, head of design, thinks the popularity of the item is an encouraging sign. \u201cThe demand from our customers for premium investment pieces is always high. The suede skirt is a perfect example of this. It\u2019s a timeless, wearable item that has a really luxe finish. It can be worked into any existing wardrobe for a 1970s look or an everyday outfit.\u201d Although a single item cannot save a floundering retailer, high-profile hits such as this can improve brand image of a brand in fashion circles and appeal to a wider audience. Lily Russo, fashion editor at Grazia, which first included the skirt in its February issue and is featuring it again this week, thinks the piece has stood out as the must-have buy of the season and that M&amp;S is right to have high hopes for its success. \u201cI think part of the reason it has garnered so much interest is that, ultimately, it is a classic wardrobe buy,\u201d said Russo. \u201cSuede skirts can be hard to come by \u2013 especially at this length and on the high street. Add the buzz generated through PR and celebrity sightings and you have a sellout product. Plus the 1970s trend is huge for summer.\u201d Russo thinks M&amp;S\u2019s waiting list strategy was clever. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of exposure on social media, and the fact that it is hard to get hold of has made it sell even faster. There is a lot of competition on the UK high street, especially in our current economic climate, and M&amp;S has done a great job of appealing to new customers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The headlines began warning us months ago of stock-market meltdown should the opposition win control after 7 May. \u201cShares tipped to fall if Labour wins next year\u2019s general election\u201d the Daily Telegraph announced in October, and some business leaders have echoed the sentiment, notably Stefano Pessina, boss of US-owned Boots the chemist. Latterly, it has been the prospect of a hung parliament that has alarmed headline writers. \u201cWake up, investors: this election will cause chaos in the financial markets\u201d (the Telegraph again). So what happens if Labour and the Tories are neck and neck while the SNP secures 50 or more seats? We are unlikely to see whirlwind talks to beat the markets\u2019 opening the day after the election. Investors will be forced to judge how much being rudderless matters to the country. After all, the Belgians went for more than 18 months without an official government in 2010 and 2011 with no worse consequences to contend with than a certain amount of mockery from foreigners. Despite the headlines, markets are much more likely to take account of global events, especially as the companies in the FTSE 100 derive an estimated two thirds of their income from abroad. It\u2019s a point emphasised by Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, who has written a review of elections and stock markets since 1974. As the charts documenting the successive Labour, Tory, Labour and coalition reigns over the past four decades show, each period of continuous office by a political party has seen an overall rise in stock values. But what they also show is that the ride has been bumpy \u2013 meaning that, looked at over different time horizons, it has not always been profitable. Since 1999 and the dotcom crash, share prices have dipped and soared only as far as to recover their previous value. If stock markets had climbed in line with inflation over this century, the index would stand at more than 10000. On Friday it closed at 7089. At the moment, markets are betting that the US Federal Reserve will delay an interest-rate rise, keeping borrowing easy; that the European Central Bank will keep printing money until it has distributed all the \u20ac1.1 trillion it promised; and that low oil prices will keep inflation down in developed economies \u2013 giving consumers more cash to spend and cutting business costs. That\u2019s why New York\u2019s Dow Jones index kept hurtling upwards last week despite one of the worst corporate-earnings reporting seasons in recent memory. Stock markets focus on calculations of future earnings, not what companies are making today. Here is a look back at what happened after the last 10 general elections, and how the stock market fared under our successive leaders. 28 February 1974 Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour party beat the Tories by just four seats. Liberals and others amassed 37 seats, forcing Wilson, already a double election winner (1964 and 1966), to form a minority government. The stock market collapsed by 50% over his eight-month tenure in 1974. But as Khalaf says, this disastrous performance was part of a much wider international picture. \u201cIn 1974, the world was facing a global recession, UK inflation was running at nearly 20%, and the oil price had quadrupled in a matter of months, as Arab nations cut supplies and production,\u201d he said. 10 October 1974 After the second election in a year, an investor might well have taken fright. The Bank of England\u2019s base lending rate was 11.5% and share values had spent much of the year in freefall. But an overall majority for Wilson and a concerted effort by the major trading nations to counter the worst effects of the oil price shock put shares on an upward trend. Still, the OECD thinktank estimated that the world economy lost around 3% of GDP in 1975 due to the high cost of oil, and Britain was a big loser. Inflation reached almost 27% and unemployment soared. In 1976, the chancellor, Denis Healey, was forced to take a loan from the International Monetary Fund to shore up confidence. The last year of the Labour administration \u2013 by which time Wilson had resigned and Jim Callaghan had replaced him \u2013 was swamped by industrial action and a second oil shock, but apart from a dip in the autumn of 1978, the stock market was left largely untouched. A turnaround of sorts had been achieved. In 1974, the ratio of share prices to company earnings \u2013 a key measure of confidence \u2013 had stood at a record low of just under four times earnings. By 1979 it was restored to a more normal 12 times earnings. 3 May 1979 Prime minister Margaret Thatcher took the helm of a boat that had already been somewhat steadied. Noting her determination to tackle inflation, the market plodded along. It was helpful for her that Ronald Reagan\u2019s central bank chief, Paul Volcker, had the same mission. But UK interest rates peaked at 17% in the early months of the government and remained in double figures for another three years. 9 June 1983 It was in Thatcher\u2019s second term that the stock market really got the bit between its teeth. The privatisation of British Telecom helped, and the starting gun was fired on a host of other selloffs. Bellwether British conglomerates like GEC, ICI and Hanson performed well. A \u00a31,000 investment when Thatcher became prime minister would come to be worth \u00a320,000 by the time John Major was to leave office in 1992. But as Khalaf points out, this was again a global phenomenon: a \u00a31,000 investment in the US stock market would have done just as well. 11 June 1987 Having won her third term, Thatcher kicked things off with the privatisation of British Steel. With chancellor Nigel Lawson firmly in charge at the Treasury, the economy was booming. The Big Bang deregulation of the City in 1986 had appeared to herald a new dawn for British banking: instead, most stockbrokers were swallowed up by the Swiss and Americans. Over the election year the market returned 5.4%. However there was a 30% fall when a wave of global panic swept through the newly computerised market on Black Monday. It was far from a UK phenomenon: the rout started in Hong and hit the US markets just as hard. Lawson\u2019s subsequent pump-priming with tax cuts and extra spending sent the economy into overdrive and then over the edge into recession in 1989, though this was also shared in the US and much of Europe. The fall of the Berlin wall in November that year proved a bigger stimulus than Lawson\u2019s plan to end double mortgage tax relief. 9 April 1992 Investors cheered John Major\u2019s Tory government, which beat all the odds to record the highest popular vote of all time with 14m votes. The FTSE 100 drove higher on the promise of more of those privatisations that had proved so lucrative in the past. The euphoria was short-lived: by late summer the EU\u2019s exchange rate mechanism was beginning to cause a sterling crisis and on 16 September the new administration was engulfed by Black Wednesday. Stocks tumbled after the UK quit the ERM \u2013 before it became clear that going back to a lower floating exchange rate was going to be good for the economy. Meanwhile, the US was booming, like the UK, on the back of low interest rates, cheap goods from China and loose credit controls on investment bank lending. 1 May 1997 Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic were in the grip of dotcom fever when Tony Blair arrived in Downing Street. The bull run was to continue until the end of the decade, when investor panic ended the dreams of many paper millionaires. By the end of 2003 the FTSE 100 had lost almost all the ground it had made in the boom. 7 June 2001 Just as for Major in 1992, September proved a cruel month for Blair\u2019s second government. After the 11 September terrorist attacks, markets tumbled as the US prepared for war in Afghanistan and the Middle East. Chancellor Gordon Brown vowed to prevent a recession (which the US suffered) and turned on the public spending taps. Shares climbed back, largely as a result of healthy emerging-market growth and the continued easy credit that triggered property booms in the UK, US and much of the continent. 5 May 2005 Blair\u2019s return was to last until June 2007 when Brown took over at No 10. Almost immediately, he was thrust into a global credit crunch. Although it started in the US, where sub-prime lenders had begun having problems from 2006, UK banks were caught with their pants down. They had lent furiously to climb the investment banking league and many of their loans were now worthless. The crash, when it came in 2008, almost wiped out all the stock market gains under Blair since 1997. Shares began to recover only after a massive stimulus by the major central banks and the decision of most governments to secure the debts of private bondholders \u2013 especially those who lent to banks. 6 May 2010 The coalition\u2019s arrival coincided with the first Greek crisis. Share values dived and have been volatile ever since. But far from joining Greece on investors\u2019 blacklist, Britain \u2013 with an independent currency, interest rates at a historical low of 0.5% and \u00a3375bn of extra money in the system from quantitative easing \u2013 became a safe haven. The peaks and troughs of the last few years all relate to the ongoing battle in Europe over austerity, which has triggered a series of panics. As Khalaf says, looking back over the last 40 years, it makes sense that the UK is buffeted by world events, considering how globalised most industries are. \u201cThe US is currently the biggest economy in the world and its stock market is commensurately influential. In fact, 22 FTSE 100 businesses actually report their earnings in dollars. The waves caused by the potential for a Greek exit from the eurozone amply demonstrate Europe has some considerable sway on UK stock prices too,\u201d he says.",

But UK interest rates peaked at 17% in the early months of the government and remained in double figures for another three years.</p> <h2><strong>9 June 1983</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d6dca467b1d60fc75743680cd2ebb08bd794ba1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/11/1428740891116/70181d8f-d70a-46bc-8f4d-a56d779dfbd8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher (with husband Denis) begins her second term as prime minister in 1983.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher (with husband Denis) begins her second term as prime minister in 1983.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manchester Daily Express/SSPL via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was in Thatcher\u2019s second term that the stock market really got the bit between its teeth. The privatisation of British Telecom helped, and the starting gun was fired on a host of other selloffs. Bellwether British conglomerates like GEC, ICI and Hanson performed well. A \u00a31,000 investment when Thatcher became prime minister would come to be worth \u00a320,000 by the time John Major was to leave office in 1992. But as Khalaf points out, this was again a global phenomenon: a \u00a31,000 investment in the US stock market would have done just as well.</p> <h2><strong>11 June 1987</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Graph of stock market\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1428759263212/web_biz-2-01.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Having won her third term, Thatcher kicked things off with the privatisation of British Steel. With chancellor Nigel Lawson firmly in charge at the Treasury, the economy was booming. The Big Bang deregulation of the City in 1986 had appeared to herald a new dawn for British banking: instead, most stockbrokers were swallowed up by the Swiss and Americans. Over the election year the market returned 5.4%.</p> <p>However there was a 30% fall when a wave of global panic swept through the newly computerised market on Black Monday. It was far from a UK phenomenon: the rout started in Hong and hit the US markets just as hard.</p> <p>Lawson\u2019s subsequent pump-priming with tax cuts and extra spending sent the economy into overdrive and then over the edge into recession in 1989, though this was also shared in the US and much of Europe. The fall of the Berlin wall in November that year proved a bigger stimulus than Lawson\u2019s plan to end double mortgage tax relief.</p> <h2><strong>9 April 1992</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3e044e55521e4dbaa852e70d372820f700cd152\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/11/1428740999613/3ddaf420-cb0e-4640-825a-9c41534f27bb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"John Major outside Downing Street in 1992.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Major outside Downing Street in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Jones/Jon Jones/Sygma/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Investors cheered John Major\u2019s Tory government, which beat all the odds to record the highest popular vote of all time with 14m votes. The FTSE 100 drove higher on the promise of more of those privatisations that had proved so lucrative in the past.</p> <p>The euphoria was short-lived: by late summer the EU\u2019s exchange rate mechanism was beginning to cause a sterling crisis and on 16 September the new administration was engulfed by Black Wednesday. Stocks tumbled after the UK quit the ERM \u2013 before it became clear that going back to a lower floating exchange rate was going to be good for the economy. Meanwhile, the US was booming, like the UK, on the back of low interest rates, cheap goods from China and loose credit controls on investment bank lending.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Graph of stock market\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1428759263286/web_biz-3-01.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>1 May 1997</strong></h2> <p>Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic were in the grip of dotcom fever when Tony Blair arrived in Downing Street. The bull run was to continue until the end of the decade, when investor panic ended the dreams of many paper millionaires. By the end of 2003 the FTSE 100 had lost almost all the ground it had made in the boom.</p> <h2><strong>7 June 2001</strong></h2> <p>Just as for Major in 1992, September proved a cruel month for Blair\u2019s second government. After the 11 September terrorist attacks, markets tumbled as the US prepared for war in Afghanistan and the Middle East. Chancellor Gordon Brown vowed to prevent a recession (which the US suffered) and turned on the public spending taps. Shares climbed back, largely as a result of healthy emerging-market growth and the continued easy credit that triggered property booms in the UK, US and much of the continent.</p> <h2><strong>5 May 2005</strong></h2> <p>Blair\u2019s return was to last until June 2007 when Brown took over at No 10. Almost immediately, he was thrust into a global credit crunch. Although it started in the US, where sub-prime lenders had begun having problems from 2006, UK banks were caught with their pants down. They had lent furiously to climb the investment banking league and many of their loans were now worthless. The crash, when it came in 2008, almost wiped out all the stock market gains under Blair since 1997. Shares began to recover only after a massive stimulus by the major central banks and the decision of most governments to secure the debts of private bondholders \u2013 especially those who lent to banks.</p> <h2><strong>6 May 2010</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"766ca5c64d70bfdc11b1781e7ed45af8d0d7ae01\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/11/1428741115606/609ff4c1-4e5f-49ec-9419-9d9b803ac56e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"David Cameron and Nick Clegg on their first day in coalition.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron and Nick Clegg on their first day in coalition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The coalition\u2019s arrival coincided with the first Greek crisis. Share values dived and have been volatile ever since. But far from joining Greece on investors\u2019 blacklist, Britain \u2013 with an independent currency, interest rates at a historical low of 0.5% and \u00a3375bn of extra money in the system from quantitative easing \u2013 became a safe haven. The peaks and troughs of the last few years all relate to the ongoing battle in Europe over austerity, which has triggered a series of panics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"graph of stock market\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1428759263377/web_biz-4-01.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As Khalaf says, looking back over the last 40 years, it makes sense that the UK is buffeted by world events, considering how globalised most industries are. \u201cThe US is currently the biggest economy in the world and its stock market is commensurately influential. In fact, 22 FTSE 100 businesses actually report their earnings in dollars. The waves caused by the potential for a Greek exit from the eurozone amply demonstrate Europe has some considerable sway on UK stock prices too,\u201d he says.</p>",

      "bodyText": "White sparks burst into the air as a man in blue overalls draws the fiery beam of his welding torch across a large metal tube. He flips up his face mask to inspect the molten join shrouded in a faint pall of white smoke. This is JCB\u2019s headquarters in Rocester, Staffordshire, where an army of workers are welding, bolting and testing the British manufacturer\u2019s latest diggers and heavy lifting machines. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone needs to worry about UK manufacturing, as long as we continue to make the right investments,\u201d says Mark Turner, group MD of business operations . But despite such optimism, Britain needs more businesses like JCB to help the government wean the economy off its dependency on debt and consumer spending, on the evidence of the widening trade deficit revealed in official statistics last week. The digger maker is one of the UK\u2019s biggest private companies. It employs 12,000 people around the world, half of them in Britain. It has 22 factories, including 11 on home turf, where it makes nearly everything required for its signature yellow machines, including engines, transmissions and cabs. In 2013, it had sales of \u00a32.68bn and profits of \u00a3313m, its third-most profitable year ever. It exports 75% of its machines to around 140 countries. It has 3,300 suppliers and consumes 175,000 tonnes of steel and 1,600 tonnes of yellow paint a year to produce its diggers. The family-owned manufacturer has a huge influence on Britain\u2019s economy. Independent analysis by Oxford Economics suggests JCB contributes \u00a31.4bn a year to GDP, \u00a3545m to the Treasury\u2019s coffers and supports 24,000 British jobs. It estimates that every full-time JCB job supports another three in the supply chain. Stalwarts reckon its history of steady growth is testament to the benefits of being privately owned because it can plot a long-term investment plan without having to explain why to demanding City investors. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about the quarterly results to see what some analysts have to say about us,\u201d Turner says. Its latest ambitious plan is to invest \u00a3150m to expand its UK manufacturing operations. This will include two factories and a \u00a315m facelift for the production line of its Loadall telescopic handler, a truck with a long-reach loading arm. \u201cIf we\u2019d been a plc, investors would have asked \u2018What are you going to do that for?\u2019 It\u2019s our business, our responsibility, so let\u2019s make the right investment.\u201d It is a philosophy that has stood the test of time. Joseph Cyril Bamford founded JCB in 1945 after he was fired by his uncle from the family business, Henry Bamford &amp; Sons, which made agricultural equipment. The young JC Bamford decided to go it alone from a rented garage in nearby Uttoxeter. He produced the world\u2019s first backhoe loader digger in 1953. The yellow digger has now sold more than half a million, accounting for one in every two backhoe loaders sold around the world. It helped propel JCB into the big time and the group is now the world\u2019s third-biggest manufacturer of construction machinery, behind Caterpillar of the US and Japan\u2019s Komatsu. The rented garage is now a distant memory. But Bamford never forgot his roots and had an exact replica of the tiny workspace built on JCB\u2019s 175 acre head office site as a permanent reminder of the company\u2019s humble beginnings. JCB has been at this facility since late 1950. Huge manmade lakes surround the head office and adjoining factories and it has a helipad so the group\u2019s two helicopters can fly customers and visiting dignitaries in and out quickly. The industry giant is still run and owned by the Bamford family; it is now led by Lord Anthony Bamford, son of the founder and prominent Tory party donor. Since taking over the reins from his father in 1975, he has forged an ambitious expansion that has seen JCB set up manufacturing operations in India, China, Brazil and America. He has also augmented the digger giant\u2019s domestic footprint. In 2004, JCB began to make its own engines. Before this, it was reliant on other producers, such as Perkins. Now JCB engines power around 70% of its machines. It reckons they are about 30% more efficient and have saved customers around a billion litres of fuel since launch. Turner believes Britain\u2019s construction market has stabilised, following a tough period during the credit crunch. However, he is quick to note that Britain is just one of its 140 markets so a downturn in one country can be offset by growth elsewhere. Having complete freedom from the whims of external investors is one thing, but there\u2019s more to the JCB culture. On a tour of the factory floor, it becomes clear that JCB is unlike most modern manufacturers. Elements of the founder\u2019s paternal management style remain strongly entwined in the business. In 1964, Joseph gave his workforce a bonus that was so generous some members of staff were able to buy their homes with it. JCB still pays a Christmas bonus and while staff may not be able to buy their homes with the festive perk, the company also offers onsite gyms and operates an angling club that fishes in the adjoining lakes. It also has annual production shutdowns, including a three-week closure in the summer. Karel Williams, professor of accounting and political economy at Manchester Business School, reckons Britain should do more to help family firms to develop and become global powerhouses: \u201cThe reason why Britain doesn\u2019t have more businesses like JCB is that founding families and owners are tempted to sell too early. We need to attend much more closely to the incentives to hold and develop their businesses into world beaters.\u201d To ensure JCB keeps up to speed with new technologies, every year it spends about 3% of its turnover \u2013 some \u00a380m \u2013 on R&amp;D. The investment that JCB has made in the business is clearly evident from the production line. The one-tonne metal skeleton of a backhoe loader moves slowly but surely along the line as gangs of men move in and out to fit the transmission; add wheels; bolt in the engine; attach a cab; fix hydraulics and add the huge claw-like shovels to the front and back. By the time it rolls off the end of the line, the workhorse of the JCB range weighs eight tonnes and is ready for some hard graft. One of these yellow beasts rolls off the line every nine minutes and one Loadall is churned out every seven minutes. Each machine is built to order and JCB can produce hundreds of variations of the same thing. It has identified the Loadall as a key growth area. It has won admirers from both the construction and agriculture sectors for its lifting power and telescopic reach of up to 20 metres. JCB consumes 60,000 tonnes of steel a year to make the Loadall and uses 160,000 tonnes of welding wire on the machine \u2013 enough to wrap around the world seven times. \u201cThese are built to last,\u201d says Turner. JCB has a rich 70-year history, but it is typical of the culture here that Turner is more concerned with the future. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about yesterday\u2019s business,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is about where we are going to be in five or 10 years\u2019 time.\u201d",
