      "bodyText": "Online retailer eBay paid just \u00a31.1m in tax in the UK last year, despite telling US investors that Britain was its second largest market, generating revenues of $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn). The company appears to have reduced its tax bill by using a corporate structure that routes advertising fees from hundreds of thousands of British sellers through an overseas company, according to UK filings. The group\u2019s main UK unit reported revenues of just \u00a3185m last year and tax of only \u00a31.1m. Latest accounts for eBay (UK) Ltd, which employs 372 staff, many of them at offices in Richmond, west London, confirm the British subsidiary does not receive a penny of the fees paid by UK sellers that advertise goods on eBay.co.uk. Instead, the UK company\u2019s revenues come from \u201cthe provision of services to eBay International AG\u201d, its Swiss parent company. This Bern-based firm, which also uses a branch office in Luxembourg, is at the heart of eBay\u2019s most significant operations outside of the US. It holds the key to hundreds of millions of dollars in tax savings the online auction group enjoys each year. Like Google, Apple and other hi-tech multinationals, eBay routes income from customers in many of its largest markets, including the UK, through a European sales hub located in a tax-friendly country. The income can then flow into further controversial tax structures that ultimately wipe huge sums off the group\u2019s tax bills. Last year, the then British chancellor George Osborne introduced a new punitive tax, known as the diverted profits tax, designed to target tech businesses artificially shifting UK revenues abroad. He said such practice had \u201cabused the trust of the British people\u201d. It later emerged, however, that while some companies, such as Amazon and Facebook, said they would change their tax structures, others \u2013 including Google \u2013 have continued to book UK sales overseas. Last year\u2019s accounts for Facebook\u2019s main UK subsidiary have been filed with Companies House and are due to be released shortly. However, changes to the group\u2019s British tax structure are not likely to be apparent from company filings until figures for 2016 are released next year. Figures for 2016 are expected to show a dramatic jump in revenues as income from Facebook\u2019s largest UK advertisers started to be booked in the UK business for the first time. Some experts, however, have suggested there may not be a huge jump in Facebook\u2019s UK taxes because of other factors. Latest accounts from eBay (UK) Ltd, published on Friday, suggest the group believes its UK tax structure remains advantageous, despite Osborne\u2019s supposed crackdown. When asked by the Guardian whether it was in discussions with HMRC about the UK\u2019s new diverted profits tax, eBay declined to comment. In a statement, it said: \u201cIn all countries and at all times, eBay is fully compliant with national, EU and international tax rules.\u201d The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: \u201cYet again, it seems like another multinational company thinks it can play by different rules to the rest of us. \u201cThe Tories have dragged their feet for years and voted against tough action to make it harder for firms to avoid UK tax. It\u2019s time they followed Labour\u2019s lead and started taking corporate tax avoidance seriously.\u201d In its annual report, the US parent company eBay Inc confirms that certain subsidiaries have secured favourable tax rulings from authorities in Luxembourg and Switzerland. This effectively approves the group\u2019s controversial European tax structure. \u201cWe benefit from tax rulings concluded in several different jurisdictions, most significantly Switzerland and Luxembourg,\u201d eBay Inc explained in the small print of its annual report. \u201cThese rulings provide for significantly lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investment and employment in those jurisdictions.\u201d As a result of these arrangements, the group said it made tax savings of $319m last year, and $986m over the last three years. eBay Inc enjoyed an effective tax rate for 2015 of 19%, well below headline rates in its three largest markets: the US, UK and Germany. eBay Inc confirms in its annual report that some tax authorities have called some of its arrangements into question, and that the years 2003 to 2012 remain under scrutiny. Further tax audits are possible in several major markets including the US, UK, Germany and Korea, it said. Accounts for eBay (UK) Ltd show revenues for 2015 down 2% at \u00a3185m, and pretax profits down almost 9% at \u00a38.1m. The tax charge for the year was \u00a31.07m, not all of which was due in the UK because the company is active elsewhere in Europe and in Australia. eBay (UK) Ltd is not the only British company within the eBay group. Another UK unit is Gumtree.com Ltd, the free-to-advertise online marketplace. It reported pretax profits of \u00a320.2m on sales of \u00a358.7m last year, and tax of \u00a34m. eBay also owns the music and sports ticket-trading website Stubhub.co.uk, but this UK-facing web business is run by eBay International AG. eBay also owned the payment processing business PayPal until it was de-merged in July last year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Swansea High Street is a jumble of deserted, crumbling buildings, fast food restaurants and charity shops. It is routinely branded one of the worst high streets in Britain; a toxic combination of rising rents, shiny new shopping centres and online retailers has sucked economic activity from the area. From Penzance to Inverness, towns and cities across Britain have been blighted by a similar fate. The proportion of empty shops in Britain is climbing \u2013 10.1% of premises lie vacant, according to an August report from the British Retail Consortium and Springboard. But Swansea\u2019s high street is fighting back and may provide a blueprint for others to follow, according to Mary Portas, retail expert and author of a 2011 government report on how to revive Britain\u2019s high streets. This wasteland, which links the train station to the town centre, has been adopted by a tribe of artists, actors and entrepreneurs who are breathing new life into the street. Art galleries, dance studios, a theatre and pubs \u2013 like The Last Resort, which is about to be opened by Matt \u201cThe Hat\u201d Lawton, who is behind Cardiff\u2019s successful Street Food Circus \u2013 are starting to take root. Portas says: \u201cThe initiative has to come from the people living in these communities to make it happen. It makes my heart leap to hear things like this, but some towns just don\u2019t have these people to make it happen.\u201d Fixing the high street by attracting creative industries was the brainchild of Huw Williams, commercial manager at Coastal Housing, a not-for-profit social housing organisation. \u201cI wrote a paper in 2004 that suggested engaging with the creative sector in order to improve the area,\u201d he says. Coastal has bankrolled the regeneration, pumping in \u00a325m: it snapped up empty buildings, built flats and renovated shop and office space. Gareth Davies, director of development at Coastal, says: \u201cWe bought our first parcel of land around here in 1998. We are now starting to see the benefits of the work that began 20 years ago, and that\u2019s how long regeneration takes.\u201d He says the easy option would be to go for big retailers. But Coastal has stuck to its plan to establish a \u201ccreative quarter\u201d. \u201cWe turned away some of the chains \u2013 the Subways and the Greggs \u2013 because that\u2019s not what we want to be,\u201d he says. Coastal\u2019s plan was simple \u2013 offer attractive rents to creative businesses and hope they would attract other, similar ventures. It worked. Elysium Gallery &amp; Studios and Volcano Theatre were two of the first of this new breed to find a home on the high street. Elysium opened in 2006 and now rents out studios to about 100 artists across three sites, as well as hosting exhibitions. Jonathan Powell, director and curator at the gallery, says: \u201cWe were here when it was really bad. It was derelict: there were only three or four shops and most of them were off-licences. It was a forgotten place, really. \u201cThere are still problems, don\u2019t get me wrong. But there are now a group of people putting energy back into the street \u2013 it\u2019s going to take time.\u201d As well as attracting the arty crowd, Coastal has targeted young entrepreneurs by signing up TechHub Swansea, which rents office space to 20 startup businesses. One of these is Veeqo, founded by Matt Warren, who grew up in nearby Llanelli. Veeqo has developed a software platform that performs back-office functions for the likes of Amazon and eBay. It has 30 employees, has already raised \u00a31.4m from investors and is in the process of raising a further \u00a34m. Perhaps the most visible sign of a renaissance is the giant mural by sought-after artist Pure Evil of the film star Elizabeth Taylor, emblazoned across the Volcano Theatre building. Pure Evil, aka Charles Uzzell-Edwards, said he wanted to \u201cplay my part\u201d in the street\u2019s makeover, as it held good memories for him. Taylor\u2019s visage glares down at a gang of art college students across the street, who chatter excitedly as they push the immaculately painted red door to enter Galerie Simpson. Inside the elegant Aladdin\u2019s cave of paintings and sculptures, Jane Simpson greets the budding artists. Simpson grew up in Swansea, but studied at the Chelsea College of Art and the Royal Academy of Art in London. Simpson quit London just over three years ago to return home. She has been pleasantly surprised by the newfound confidence that is coursing through her hometown. \u201cI think Swansea is a very different place now \u2013 there is a lot of energy. We are not Cardiff, which is good because big towns have to deal with big expectations. There\u2019s always been that grit in the oyster in Swansea. We can be a bit more maverick here.\u201d Portas reckons this nascent regeneration will show other towns that change is possible. \u201cThe truth is, you can make regeneration happen,\u201d the retail expert says. \u201cIf you have a community of people that want to make change happen. However, there are councils that just can\u2019t see a way out of it. \u201cYou need vision \u2013 these people who are doing it are obviously rooted in that community. If you have people living there, that\u2019s when change happens. Good for them.\u201d",

Pure Evil, <a href=\"http://pureevilgallery.virb.com/who-is-pure-evil\">aka Charles Uzzell-Edwards</a>, said he wanted to \u201cplay my part\u201d in the street\u2019s makeover, as it held good memories for him.</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s visage glares down at a gang of art college students across the street, who chatter excitedly as they push the immaculately painted red door to enter Galerie Simpson.</p> <p>Inside the elegant Aladdin\u2019s cave of paintings and sculptures, Jane Simpson greets the budding artists. Simpson grew up in Swansea, but studied at the Chelsea College of Art and the Royal Academy of Art in London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c654a0e1cd0422f958c06e8b3e97a59aed344c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c654a0e1cd0422f958c06e8b3e97a59aed344c2/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Simpson, owner of Galerie Simpson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Simpson, owner of Galerie Simpson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simpson quit London just over three years ago to return home. She has been pleasantly surprised by the newfound confidence that is coursing through her hometown.</p> <p>\u201cI think Swansea is a very different place now \u2013 there is a lot of energy. We are not Cardiff, which is good because big towns have to deal with big expectations. There\u2019s always been that grit in the oyster in Swansea. We can be a bit more maverick here.\u201d</p> <p>Portas reckons this nascent regeneration will show other towns that change is possible. \u201cThe truth is, you can make regeneration happen,\u201d the retail expert says. \u201cIf you have a community of people that want to make change happen. However, there are councils that just can\u2019t see a way out of it.</p> <p>\u201cYou need vision \u2013 these people who are doing it are obviously rooted in that community. If you have people living there, that\u2019s when change happens. Good for them.\u201d</p>",
