      "bodyText": "One of the City's biggest fund managers \u2013 Legal &amp; General \u2013 has warned that it will vote against the chairman of any FTSE 100 company that persists with an all-male board after the government's two-year deadline for board diversity. The fund-management group is in the process of rewriting its policies for annual meetings and is telling companies that from 2015 it will vote against the chairman or the chairman of the nominations committee if they have not installed any women on the board, or if aspirational targets have not been set, or if disclosure about gender balance is inadequate. L&amp;G has been considering the move for a number years, and particularly in light of Lord Davies's recommendations that a quarter of boardroom positions should be held by women by 2015. Figures published by the government this week showed that the Davies targets \u2013 set in 2011 \u2013 have resulted in more female non-executive directors (part-time directors who are not company employees and who provide outside expertise and oversight). Women now hold almost 24% of non-executive seats and only five out of the top 100 companies are now men-only domains. But the progress of women in full-time executive roles has been slower. Women hold just 6.1% of executive positions, compared with 5.5% when Davies reported. Earlier this week the business secretary, Vince Cable, said it was crucial to focus on the management level just below the main board \u2013 usually called the executive committee \u2013 to get more women into top jobs. However, an analysis of FTSE-100 companies by the Guardian shows that one in four of the UK's largest listed firms have no women on their executive committees. Overall, just 14.7% of places on these committees are occupied by women. A similar exercise conducted earlier this year by Cranfield Business School found the proportion of women on executive committees has fallen from 17.2% in 2010 to 15.3% in 2013. One of the all-male executive committees is at Royal Bank of Scotland, the 81% taxpayer-owned bank. Chris Sullivan, chief executive of RBS's corporate banking division who sits on the committee, said at a conference this week that he did not believe in quotas to ensure more women are promoted. \"I am 150% against quotas because the consequences can be horrific. You can hit your quota with unqualified people and then people say that gender equality doesn't work,\" Sullivan said. The coalition government also opposed proposals to introduce mandatory quotas when they were discussed by the European commission, although it has been vocal on the topic of boardroom diversity. Yesterday Cable told the Guardian: \"More women in the boardroom is an important first step, but our efforts must also extend into the executive level of companies as well. \"Too often we are seeing talented women leave their jobs in the middle parts of their career to look after children and not return to work. This not only creates a brain drain in key sectors, but it is also hindering women's career progression because they are playing catch-up with their male counterparts if they do return. \"These women are the CEOs of tomorrow, and we cannot look to build a stronger economy without tapping into the full talent of our workforce.\" The problem of companies losing female employees is most acute for women aged between 30 and 35, although attrition rates are notable through all stages of female careers. A report published last year by the City headhunting firm MWM Consultin g on getting more women into senior executive roles found that women represented 38% of lower or middle management roles, but only 11% at executive committee level. Michael Reyner, a partner at MWM, said: \"At entry level companies employ roughly half men and half women. But the numbers of women then decreases right the way through a company. The problem is not so much a 'glass ceiling' as often suggested, but much more of a 'slippery ladder.'\" The issue of the executive pipeline was one of the main discussion points at by the Women's Business Forum and fronted by diversity consultant Heather Jackson, included speeches from leading businessmen. The second was held by the Chartered Management Institute and included contributions from Susan Vinnicombe, a professor at Cranfield School of Management and Helen Calcraft, the co-founder of the advertising agency Lucky Generals. Jackson said: \"I'd like to apologise to the next generation, because too many of my peers and friends packed their careers in because they didn't like the culture rather than working to try and change the organisation.\"",

On 31 October, the Treasury has to pay $6bn in interest to the holders of Treasury bonds. It can\u2019t \u201croll over\u201d interest payments; it has to pay them. Barclays says that if nothing else, Treasury should spend at least $6bn of its cash on making this payment.</p> <p><strong>Is there any other kind of wiggle room?</strong></p> <p>Moody\u2019s suggests that interest payments could be considered expenditures, so Treasury could decide not to make those payments.</p> <p><strong>Could it really? We can just not pay things?</strong></p> <p>Well, Moody\u2019s argues it this way: \u201cThe debt limit restricts government expenditures to the amount of its incoming revenues; it does not prohibit the government from servicing its debt.

So, argues Moody\u2019s, if the Treasury wants to skip an interest payment, it\u2019s not a default.</p> <p><strong>Hmmm. I dunno about this, Homer.

You have to trust Moody\u2019s, but there are other factors of market psychology that indicate that not paying the interest on Treasury bonds would be a disaster. It would signal to the world that the US Treasury is a deadbeat. Treasury bonds are popular now because they are completely secure; they reflect faith that the government knows what it\u2019s doing and respects the financial health of the country.

WH Smith said it has also renewed a contract to operate 82 post offices in its stores for a further five years.</p> <p>Chief executive Stephen Clarke, who took over from long-term WH Smith boss Kate Swann earlier this year, said the post offices were part of a plan to make the best use of store space and encourage more shoppers to visit.</p> <p>However, a spokesperson for the Communication Workers Union (CWU) said: \"We have grave concerns over WH Smith taking on a further 16 post offices.\"</p> <p>Postal workers have been involved in a series of strikes since plans were revealed to franchise around 70 crown post offices, which are currently run by the government-owned service.</p> <p>The CWU said the deal with WH Smith put the future of post offices at risk. It cited the case of a post office in Runcorn which has now moved to a Tesco store, while another in Grays, Essex, is being temporarily run from a council building.</p> <p>The union is also concerned about job losses after hundreds of long-term staff were made redundant when WH Smith took on its initial batch of post offices in 2006. However, WH Smith said all staff would be transferred under rules which protect pay and conditions, and no redundancies were planned.</p> <p>The row overshadowed another rise in profits, in line with expectations, at WH Smith despite falling sales. Pre-tax profits rose 6% to \u00a3108m as the company cut costs, improved efficiency and switched to selling more profitable items such as stationery, as sales fell 5% to \u00a31.2bn. Underlying sales, which strip out the impact of new store openings and closures, slid at WH Smith's high street and travel stores, by 6% and 4% respectively, as sales of its core categories \u2013 stationery, books and newspapers/magazines \u2013 slipped back.</p> <p>The company expects to open about 40 outlets a year in overseas airports, hospitals and railway stations. In the next half year it will open 20 outlets including its first stores in Russia and Qatar. The company now has 141 international outlets.</p> <p>It is often criticised for shoddy looking stores in the UK with one Twitter account devoted to picturing its dirty carpets, but Clarke said WH Smith had spent \u00a312m on improvements in the past year and more updates were in the pipeline.</p>",

Chief executive Stephen Clarke, who took over from long-term WH Smith boss Kate Swann earlier this year, said the post offices were part of a plan to make the best use of store space and encourage more shoppers to visit. However, a spokesperson for the Communication Workers Union (CWU) said: \"We have grave concerns over WH Smith taking on a further 16 post offices.\" Postal workers have been involved in a series of strikes since plans were revealed to franchise around 70 crown post offices, which are currently run by the government-owned service. The CWU said the deal with WH Smith put the future of post offices at risk. It cited the case of a post office in Runcorn which has now moved to a Tesco store, while another in Grays, Essex, is being temporarily run from a council building. The union is also concerned about job losses after hundreds of long-term staff were made redundant when WH Smith took on its initial batch of post offices in 2006. However, WH Smith said all staff would be transferred under rules which protect pay and conditions, and no redundancies were planned. The row overshadowed another rise in profits, in line with expectations, at WH Smith despite falling sales. Pre-tax profits rose 6% to \u00a3108m as the company cut costs, improved efficiency and switched to selling more profitable items such as stationery, as sales fell 5% to \u00a31.2bn. Underlying sales, which strip out the impact of new store openings and closures, slid at WH Smith's high street and travel stores, by 6% and 4% respectively, as sales of its core categories \u2013 stationery, books and newspapers/magazines \u2013 slipped back. The company expects to open about 40 outlets a year in overseas airports, hospitals and railway stations. In the next half year it will open 20 outlets including its first stores in Russia and Qatar. The company now has 141 international outlets. It is often criticised for shoddy looking stores in the UK with one Twitter account devoted to picturing its dirty carpets, but Clarke said WH Smith had spent \u00a312m on improvements in the past year and more updates were in the pipeline.",

But the government decided that those who applied for more than \u00a310,000 would get no shares at all, blocking big private investors, after being overwhelmed with applications for more than seven times the number of shares available. David Cameron tweeted: \"I'm glad every small investor will get their #RoyalMail shares \u2013 their investment will help deliver a 1st class service.\" The government will collect between \u00a31.7bn and \u00a32bn from the sale, depending on exactly how many shares it sellson Friday. It is selling between 52% and 60% of the 500-year-old company with a further 10% being given to Royal Mail's 150,000 employees, who will each collect shares worth about \u00a32,200. Royal Mail's employees will also receive additional shares they applied for up to \u00a310,000. Cable said the government had \"struck the right balance\" by \"increasing the proportion of shares going to small investors to ensure they get their fair share\". But Labour accused the government of undervaluing the company and \"massively short-changing\" taxpayers by failing to set a higher price. The shares, which have been priced at the maximum 330p each, valuing the company at \u00a33.3bn, are expected to immediately rise by 20-30%. Some City pundits are predicting the shares could top 450p \u2013 a 36% increase \u2013 on the first day of trading. About 730,000 people applied for shares in Royal Mail and almost 95% of the applicants will receive 227 shares worth \u00a3749.10. The government said the 5% of people that applied for more than \u00a310,000 \u2013 who are likely to be well established investors because they would have had to have made their application via a stockbroker \u2013 \"will not receive an allocation\". It said penalising the biggest private investors was \"in line with the treatment of larger applications in previous well oversubscribed privatisations\". Cable said: \"Our priority has always been protection of the consumer through the universal service obligation, good value for money for the taxpayer, and a stable long-term ownership structure that will enable Royal Mail to be a successful enterprise and to raise commercial funding to invest. This listing achieves all of these objectives. We have struck the right balance, increasing the proportion of shares going to small investors to ensure they get their fair share and ensuring the employees get a 10 % stake in the business.\" If the shares rise by 20%, the 690,000 people granted \u00a3749.10 worth of shares will make a near-instant paper profit of \u00a3150. Demand from the public was so strong that it would have allowed all of the shares to be sold to the public. The government has increased the proportion of shares granted to ordinary investors from 30% to 33%, by reducing the amount going to pension funds and other institutional investors from 70% to 67%. Malcolm Hurlston, chairman of the Esop Centre, which promotes employee shareholding schemes, said it was \"disappointing that so much\" had been reserved for City funds over small investors. \"This was an error of judgment: benefits should have accrued to individual UK applicants,\" he said. City investors applied for more than 20 times the number of shares that were available to them, heightening fears that the postal service was being sold off too cheaply. Analysts have said the government could have set the share price at up to 450p. If the shares were sold at this price, the government would have made an extra \u00a3700m. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said: \"We are seeing a centuries-old and much-loved national institution flogged off in a fire sale to fill the hole left by George Osborne's failed economic plan. Royal Mail is being sold off on the cheap with taxpayers being shortchanged to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds. Yet out-of-touch ministers have ploughed on regardless and claimed this is a 'triumph'. \"It is astounding that the sale has been 20 times oversubscribed by City investors, which only serves to underline worries that ministers have got it badly wrong, with only a minority of shares going to small investors. \"Increasingly this privatisation is looking like a botched job from an out-of-touch government that puts the wrong people first.\" Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, which represents more than 100,000 postal workers and is currently planning days of strike action, said: \"Now everyone knows that Royal Mail has been undervalued and sold on the cheap. \"This successful British company has been flogged on the cheap for no good reason. It was flourishing in public ownership, could have accessed private capital in public ownership \u2013 as many other companies do \u2013 and could have continued to provide a high service in public ownership. Instead, it has been thrown an uncertain future based on profit margins not services.\"",

      "bodyText": "Barclays is facing court action in the US as energy regulators attempt to force the scandal-hit UK bank to pay a $470m (\u00a3330m) penalty for allegedly manipulating power prices in California. The US federal energy regulatory commission (Ferc) said it had filed a suit seeking an order to affirm its previous demand for civil penalties from the bank and four of its former traders. The potential penalty was announced a year ago, but Barclays insists it has not broken any laws in the way it traded electricity prices in California over two years to December 2008.

Previous documents released by Ferc contain messages exchanged between four former Barclays employees \u2013 Daniel Brin, Scott Connelly, Karen Levine and Ryan Smith \u2013 in which they are said to have discussed \"propping up\" an electricity index.

      "standfirst": "Investors hopeful American politicians will resolve budget and debt differences", 
      "body": "<p>Leading shares moved sharply higher on hopes that a deal to unlock the US budget and debt ceiling deadlock could be resolved.</p> <p>With meetings continuing between political parties and talk of a six week extension to the debt ceiling, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 92.58 points higher at 6430.49 after three days of falls.</p> <p>On top of that, investors were comforted by confirmation that President Obama had nominated the dovish Janet Yellen as the successor to Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. However the latest Fed minutes released on Wednesday showed the central bank's members split on whether to begin tapering its monthly bond buying. In the end they decided to leave the $85bn programme in place.</p> <p><strong>Persimmon</strong> put on another 64p to \u00a311.95 in the wake of the UK government's launch of the next stage of its Help to Buy scheme, and a positive note on Wednesday from Goldman Sachs. Deutsche Bank has added to the upbeat mood by also issuing optimistic comments on the sector:</p> <blockquote> While we recognise the complexity of the investment case for housebuilders may have increased as macro factors have grown in importance, we believe consensus estimates and stock valuations are yet to reflect the scale of the upside potential to profitability and returns that house price inflation brings. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Whitbread</strong> added 122p to \u00a331.14 after Oriel Securities moved from hold to buy:</p> <blockquote> Premier Inn and Costa have strong market positions and significant growth prospects based on the opening of new units - shares have shown some recent weakness and with the prospective PE falling to 16 times for 2014/15, we consider the shares are attractive. </blockquote> <p>Barclays was also positive on the group, repeating its overweight rating:</p> <blockquote> We believe risks to forecasts are skewed firmly to the upside relating both to Premier Inn and Costa. Premier has a structural growth story worth around 10% to earnings per annum but consensus reflects nothing for any cyclical recovery on top despite the fact that real revenue per available room in the UK regions is 23% below peak and the market data is recovering sharply already. On Costa we highlight three sources of upside risk ahead of the 12 December investor day: 1) UK like for like growth \u2013 cyclical and structural upside, 2) Costa Express - we see earnings tripling by 2018 and 3) International. While we expect management to be cautious regarding the speed of the International profit ramp-up, given investment intentions, we also believe that consensus forecasts are already reflecting conservative growth assumptions. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>GKN</strong> climbed 15p to 358.2p after poaching Adam Walker from media group <strong>Informa</strong> as its new finance director to replace the retiring William Seeger. Informa dipped 0.5p to 509.5p. But Panmure Gordon issued a buy note on Informa, saying that with the departure of Walker and the retirement of chief executive Peter Rigby, the chances of a break-up had increased:</p> <blockquote> Rigby and Walker, to a lesser extent, were the architects of the current group conglomerate structure/strategy. Rational break-up values should yield valuations of more than 600p, in our view. There is no suggestion that either of these departures is trading-related. <br> </blockquote> <p>Ian Whittaker at Liberum Capital took the oppositive view. In a sell note he said:</p> <blockquote> Whatever the reason [for Walker leaving], it is not positive. To us, it also suggests that a short-term break-up of Informa is unlikely (we think Mr Walker would have stayed around to guide this). </blockquote> <p><strong>BAE Systems</strong> rose 10.7p to 450.7p after a positive update, although it warned that earnings could be hit by 6p to 7p if it fails to reach agreement on pricing with Saudi Arabia over the purchase of 72 Eurofighter Typhoon jets. It also said the US government shutdown had only made a slight impact so far - it had told some 1,200 workers not to come in - but its operations in the country could be harder hit if there is no resolution.</p> <p><strong>Standard Chartered</strong> added 33.5p to 1469.5p despite analysts at Berenberg putting a sell rating on the shares and cutting their target price from \u00a312 to \u00a314.50, saying the bank may have to issue $6bn if new capital in the future. Analysts James Chappell and Michelle Wilson said:</p> <blockquote> Standard Chartered has become too big to grow at double digits without a consequent increase in risk and volatility. Its size also raises issues in terms of its complexity and ability to manage and control the business. Investment banking now represents 42% of revenues. <br> The growth outlook for emerging markets is slowing and has become more volatile, raising cyclical headwinds.  Shareholder returns at Standard Chartered could continue to be flat, as they have been for the last five years, if it continues to pursue a growth mandate. In Berenberg's view this could lead to a $6bn capital raise. Berenberg believes its focus needs to switch to returns in order to stop the de-rating that has occurred over the last few years. </blockquote> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> ended 2.4p higher at 217.4p despite a profit warning from Kabel Deutschland, which the mobile phone group is in the process of buying. The German group cut its guidance for sales growth in 2013/14 from 8% to 5% to 6%. It also said:</p> <p>The Vodafone transaction triggers certain events which will negatively impact Kabel Deutschland's net income by approximately \u20ac205m in this fiscal year. The biggest portion relates to the loss of deferred tax assets which are either at risk due to change-of-control regulations or no longer effective after completion of the intended domination and profit-and-loss transfer agreement with Vodafone. The other effects include financing related costs as a result of the prepayment of the existing senior credit facilities and other transaction costs.</p> <p>In a hold note on Vodafone, Oriel Securities said:</p> <blockquote> This is an unfortunate start for Vodafone's ownership of Kabel Deutschland. We also think it is regrettable that, after the end of the additional acceptance period, Vodafone has only 77% of Kabel Deutschland. Vodafone needs 90% to squeeze out minorities. Therefore, with a minority Kabel share listing remaining, Vodafone must always take a lot of care to properly share out the benefits of Kabel being part of the Vodafone group. <br> Beyond the near term we are uncertain about how big Vodafone's execution risk will be in trying to sell ever larger bundles of services to residential and business customers over a mix of owned mobile, owned cable and wholesaled Fibre-To-The-Cabinet networks. </blockquote> <p>Oriel is also downbeat on the prospects of a US takeover - AT&amp;T has been rumoured to be interested - if Verizon decided to buy out Vodafone's stake in their wireless joint venture rather than proposing a full link-up. Oriel said:</p> <blockquote> Last month, at a broker conference, Verizon's chief executive was asked why, if AT&amp;T sees potential in Europe, Verizon did not choose to merge with Vodafone. He said: <br>\"...as Vittorio [Vodafone's chief executive ] and I looked at a potential merger, we could make a pretty good story about enterprise (serving business customers). There was an ok story about synergies. But if you looked at the next five years, the growth prospects for us in the US so outweighed the prospects for Europe, mostly because of the economy and partially because of the regulatory environment, I could not make a strong case for the Verizon shareholder that it was better to merge than it was to go more aggressively in the United States. So that is the approach we took.\" <br>This is despite (i) Japan's Softbank injecting its competitive expertise and $5bn into Sprint (third of four nationwide mobile players in the US); (ii) TMUS (fourth of four nationwide mobile players) striving to become an ever more potent competitor. <br> <br>We continue to advise trimming overweight positions in Vodafone. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Unilever</strong>, which recently warned of a slowdown in its key emerging markets, edged up just 2p to \u00a323.53 as Givaudan, a maker of fragrances and flavours which supplies the Anglo-Dutch company, saw a drop in third quarter sales. It echoed Unilever by blaming depreciating currencies in emerging markets.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, <strong>WH Smith</strong> added 47p to 882p following a 6% rise in full year profits and news of a \u00a350m share buyback.</p> <p>But home shopping specialist <strong>N Brown</strong> lost another 13.3p to 475.7p after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/oct/09/n-brown-shares-fall-bad-debts\" title=\"\">Wednesday's update</a> where profits slightly missed expectations.</p> <p><strong>Ladbrokes</strong> rose 5.2p to 185p on talk that a major stake of almost 3% had changed hands. The company recently issued another profit warning, partly due to restarting its digital platform with Playtech as a new partner, putting more pressure on its management. Numis said:</p> <blockquote> Following a large trade in Ladbrokes' shares yesterday there is press comment that a sub-3% stake has been bought by either Playtech or interests associated with Playtech founder Teddy Sagi and that this could be the precursor to a bid. Playtech and CVC are both mentioned as potential bidders. <br> <br>Joe Lewis, Dermot Desmond, John Magnier and J.P McManus have all been rumoured at one time or another to have significant stakes in Ladbrokes but held through CFDs and other instruments which mean that stakes are not disclosed. A bid from some combination of the above has been a persistent rumour. <br> <br>Given the information we actually know, that trading has been poor and that Ladbrokes is struggling with considerable strategic challenges in a very competitive market, we reiterate our Hold rating and 185p price target. <br> </blockquote> <p>Chip designer <strong>Imagination Technologies</strong> has been under the cosh recently.</p> <p>Its shares have fallen around 16% in a week, partly due to investors shunning the technology sector but also thanks to worries about it using market share at key customers like Apple and MediaTek. But analysts at Morgan Stanley believe the concerns are exaggerated, and an upbeat note from the bank has helped lift Imagination's shares 18.6p or 7% to 280.7p.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares moved sharply higher on hopes that a deal to unlock the US budget and debt ceiling deadlock could be resolved. With meetings continuing between political parties and talk of a six week extension to the debt ceiling, the FTSE 100 finished 92.58 points higher at 6430.49 after three days of falls. On top of that, investors were comforted by confirmation that President Obama had nominated the dovish Janet Yellen as the successor to Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. However the latest Fed minutes released on Wednesday showed the central bank's members split on whether to begin tapering its monthly bond buying. In the end they decided to leave the $85bn programme in place. Persimmon put on another 64p to \u00a311.95 in the wake of the UK government's launch of the next stage of its Help to Buy scheme, and a positive note on Wednesday from Goldman Sachs. Deutsche Bank has added to the upbeat mood by also issuing optimistic comments on the sector: While we recognise the complexity of the investment case for housebuilders may have increased as macro factors have grown in importance, we believe consensus estimates and stock valuations are yet to reflect the scale of the upside potential to profitability and returns that house price inflation brings. Elsewhere Whitbread added 122p to \u00a331.14 after Oriel Securities moved from hold to buy: Premier Inn and Costa have strong market positions and significant growth prospects based on the opening of new units - shares have shown some recent weakness and with the prospective PE falling to 16 times for 2014/15, we consider the shares are attractive. Barclays was also positive on the group, repeating its overweight rating: We believe risks to forecasts are skewed firmly to the upside relating both to Premier Inn and Costa. Premier has a structural growth story worth around 10% to earnings per annum but consensus reflects nothing for any cyclical recovery on top despite the fact that real revenue per available room in the UK regions is 23% below peak and the market data is recovering sharply already. On Costa we highlight three sources of upside risk ahead of the 12 December investor day: 1) UK like for like growth \u2013 cyclical and structural upside, 2) Costa Express - we see earnings tripling by 2018 and 3) International. While we expect management to be cautious regarding the speed of the International profit ramp-up, given investment intentions, we also believe that consensus forecasts are already reflecting conservative growth assumptions. GKN climbed 15p to 358.2p after poaching Adam Walker from media group Informa as its new finance director to replace the retiring William Seeger. Informa dipped 0.5p to 509.5p. But Panmure Gordon issued a buy note on Informa, saying that with the departure of Walker and the retirement of chief executive Peter Rigby, the chances of a break-up had increased: Rigby and Walker, to a lesser extent, were the architects of the current group conglomerate structure/strategy. Rational break-up values should yield valuations of more than 600p, in our view. There is no suggestion that either of these departures is trading-related. Ian Whittaker at Liberum Capital took the oppositive view. In a sell note he said: Whatever the reason [for Walker leaving], it is not positive. To us, it also suggests that a short-term break-up of Informa is unlikely (we think Mr Walker would have stayed around to guide this). BAE Systems rose 10.7p to 450.7p after a positive update, although it warned that earnings could be hit by 6p to 7p if it fails to reach agreement on pricing with Saudi Arabia over the purchase of 72 Eurofighter Typhoon jets. It also said the US government shutdown had only made a slight impact so far - it had told some 1,200 workers not to come in - but its operations in the country could be harder hit if there is no resolution. Standard Chartered added 33.5p to 1469.5p despite analysts at Berenberg putting a sell rating on the shares and cutting their target price from \u00a312 to \u00a314.50, saying the bank may have to issue $6bn if new capital in the future. Analysts James Chappell and Michelle Wilson said: Standard Chartered has become too big to grow at double digits without a consequent increase in risk and volatility. Its size also raises issues in terms of its complexity and ability to manage and control the business. Investment banking now represents 42% of revenues. The growth outlook for emerging markets is slowing and has become more volatile, raising cyclical headwinds. Shareholder returns at Standard Chartered could continue to be flat, as they have been for the last five years, if it continues to pursue a growth mandate. In Berenberg's view this could lead to a $6bn capital raise. Berenberg believes its focus needs to switch to returns in order to stop the de-rating that has occurred over the last few years. Vodafone ended 2.4p higher at 217.4p despite a profit warning from Kabel Deutschland, which the mobile phone group is in the process of buying. The German group cut its guidance for sales growth in 2013/14 from 8% to 5% to 6%. It also said: The Vodafone transaction triggers certain events which will negatively impact Kabel Deutschland's net income by approximately \u20ac205m in this fiscal year. The biggest portion relates to the loss of deferred tax assets which are either at risk due to change-of-control regulations or no longer effective after completion of the intended domination and profit-and-loss transfer agreement with Vodafone. The other effects include financing related costs as a result of the prepayment of the existing senior credit facilities and other transaction costs. In a hold note on Vodafone, Oriel Securities said: This is an unfortunate start for Vodafone's ownership of Kabel Deutschland. We also think it is regrettable that, after the end of the additional acceptance period, Vodafone has only 77% of Kabel Deutschland. Vodafone needs 90% to squeeze out minorities. Therefore, with a minority Kabel share listing remaining, Vodafone must always take a lot of care to properly share out the benefits of Kabel being part of the Vodafone group. Beyond the near term we are uncertain about how big Vodafone's execution risk will be in trying to sell ever larger bundles of services to residential and business customers over a mix of owned mobile, owned cable and wholesaled Fibre-To-The-Cabinet networks. Oriel is also downbeat on the prospects of a US takeover - AT&amp;T has been rumoured to be interested - if Verizon decided to buy out Vodafone's stake in their wireless joint venture rather than proposing a full link-up. Oriel said: Last month, at a broker conference, Verizon's chief executive was asked why, if AT&amp;T sees potential in Europe, Verizon did not choose to merge with Vodafone. He said: \"...as Vittorio [Vodafone's chief executive ] and I looked at a potential merger, we could make a pretty good story about enterprise (serving business customers). There was an ok story about synergies. But if you looked at the next five years, the growth prospects for us in the US so outweighed the prospects for Europe, mostly because of the economy and partially because of the regulatory environment, I could not make a strong case for the Verizon shareholder that it was better to merge than it was to go more aggressively in the United States. So that is the approach we took.\" This is despite (i) Japan's Softbank injecting its competitive expertise and $5bn into Sprint (third of four nationwide mobile players in the US); (ii) TMUS (fourth of four nationwide mobile players) striving to become an ever more potent competitor. We continue to advise trimming overweight positions in Vodafone. But Unilever, which recently warned of a slowdown in its key emerging markets, edged up just 2p to \u00a323.53 as Givaudan, a maker of fragrances and flavours which supplies the Anglo-Dutch company, saw a drop in third quarter sales. It echoed Unilever by blaming depreciating currencies in emerging markets. Among the mid-caps, WH Smith added 47p to 882p following a 6% rise in full year profits and news of a \u00a350m share buyback. But home shopping specialist N Brown lost another 13.3p to 475.7p after Wednesday's update where profits slightly missed expectations. Ladbrokes rose 5.2p to 185p on talk that a major stake of almost 3% had changed hands. The company recently issued another profit warning, partly due to restarting its digital platform with Playtech as a new partner, putting more pressure on its management. Numis said: Following a large trade in Ladbrokes' shares yesterday there is press comment that a sub-3% stake has been bought by either Playtech or interests associated with Playtech founder Teddy Sagi and that this could be the precursor to a bid. Playtech and CVC are both mentioned as potential bidders. Joe Lewis, Dermot Desmond, John Magnier and J.P McManus have all been rumoured at one time or another to have significant stakes in Ladbrokes but held through CFDs and other instruments which mean that stakes are not disclosed. A bid from some combination of the above has been a persistent rumour. Given the information we actually know, that trading has been poor and that Ladbrokes is struggling with considerable strategic challenges in a very competitive market, we reiterate our Hold rating and 185p price target. Chip designer Imagination Technologies has been under the cosh recently. Its shares have fallen around 16% in a week, partly due to investors shunning the technology sector but also thanks to worries about it using market share at key customers like Apple and MediaTek. But analysts at Morgan Stanley believe the concerns are exaggerated, and an upbeat note from the bank has helped lift Imagination's shares 18.6p or 7% to 280.7p. The bank said: We believe the fall is overdone as Imagination's graphics processing unit (GPU) is in the latest Apple iPhone products and it continues to see design wins at MediaTek. Inmarsat, the satellite communications group, lost 7.5p to 697.5p after Societe Generale began coverage with a sell note and 670p target. It said: Existing services prospects are slowing, dividend growth looks uncovered, and new services will likely face stiffer competitive pressure. Finally Real Good Food added nearly 5% to 53.5p after it won new supply contracts for its Whitworths sugars range from Asda and Booker. House broker Shore Capital said: The new agreements with Asda and Booker will see a doubling in retail value of Whitworths sugar sales.

      "bodyText": "More than 700,000 people have applied for shares in Royal Mail, with the public placing orders for more than seven times the number of shares available to them. It is predicted that shares will be priced at 330p rising to between 385p and 405p on the first day. A rise to 400p would mean investors with \u00a3750 of shares will be worth \u00a3900 by the end of Friday afternoon. The sale has revived privatisation fever last seen in the 1980s, and has intesified fears that the postal service is being sold too cheaply, with analysts at City firm Canaccord Genuity saying it could be worth as much as \u00a36bn. The government will announce the share price investors have to pay, along with how many investors have been allocated, once the stock market has closed this evening, sometime after 16.30 GMT. Did you apply for shares in Royal Mail? Share your application experiences and tell us why you're hoping to invest by adding your comment to the thread. Guardian readers explain their experiences of investing and why. @samcornwell I'm 33, and a small time investor who was hoping to buy \u00a32000 worth through my dealer Halifax Share Dealing. It looks like I'm only being allocated \u00a3749.1 worth (227). I considered selling immediately and taking a profit - something I expect the current government would hope for, giving our economy a much needed stimulus, but I think I'll hold for the long term as \u00a3750 is not a great deal of money these days and I expect a dividend to be announced within a year, not to mention the price continuing to rise as trackers start buying the fund once it enters the FTSE 100. The value that had been placed on it, although fair, seemed very undervalued when you consider tech stocks like Netflix, Facebook, Google and Tesla. When you think about it, the Royal Mail is hopelessly intertwined with tech now, as online shopping is fast becoming the norm. \u00a33-4bn seems ridiculously cheap when you look at Tesla Motors ($22bn), Facebook ($100bn), especially considering the RM's massive infrastructure and history. I honestly think the public would have happily accepted a \u00a310bn valuation on the company - a reason why I was delighted to buy in so cheaply. I don't agree with the privatising of Royal Mail.

GW Here's a shocking suggestion: As we don't celebrate Thanksgiving over here, UK tweeters &amp; bloggers will be free... European stocks markets have surged on hopes of a debt ceiling deal, even a short-term patch-up job. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares jumped 92 points to close at 6430, a gain of almost 1.5% The German Dax and French CAC provisionally closed 2% higher, and Spain's IBEX gained 2.2%.

There's big news coming in the UK soon -- the pricing and allocation details of the Royal Mail flotation. Again, we have a brand new live blog to cover it, with Nick Fletcher: Royal Mail share price and allocation announced - live Here's another image showing how rumours of a six-week debt ceiling extension hit bonds maturing at the end of next month: Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts has filed a full news story on Jack Lew's warning over the looming debt ceiling. It begins: The Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, warned on Thursday that the continued brinksmanship over the debt limit risks unforeseen consequences in the financial markets that could in turn lead to the US running out of cash within days. As pressure mounted on Congress to cut a deal before next Thursday's deadline for extending the federal debt limit, Lew accused Republicans of underestimating the danger of inadvertently triggering a stampede among investors that could rapidly drain remaining reserves. US Treasury secretary: Republicans underestimate debt ceiling danger My US colleagues will be live-blogging all the action in Washington in the coming hours in a New Live Blog: Boehner eyes short-term debt ceiling fix as shutdown enters 10th day \u2013 live Tom McCarthy's in charge, and is covering all the details of the deal which House speaker John Boehner has apparently proposed. It's being billed as a 'clean' budget deal, but it may not be clean enough Fox News' Ed Henry reports a version of Boehner's offer that does not sound like the \"clean\" debt ceiling lift the White House has insisted on. Boehner appears to be offering short-term relief on the debt ceiling in exchange for concessions to reopen the government, according to Henry. There are now reports out of Washington that the Republicans will propose a six-week extension of the debt limit. That would kick the can down the road to the end of November. There are already signs that nervous traders are selling short-term bonds which mature around then, pushing down their price and raising the yield. Here's a round-up of the key points from Treasury Secretary Jack Lew's appearance before the Senate finance committee, on the debt ceiling. (highlights start here) \u2022 Jack Lew has warned that the 'manufactured political crisis' over the US debt ceiling and a budget for 2014 is starting to hurt the US economy, ten days after the federal government dramatically shut down. Lew told the committee that America will probably hit its borrowing limit on 17 October, and predicted irrevocable damage if America's government were to default. \u2022 Asked whether America was acting like a \"blindfolded man walking towards a cliff\", Lew replied that his big fear is that the US government should stumble into a default. Lew also slammed politicians who imagine there's more time to haggle, saying: In Washington there is a parlour game of 'When is the last minute'. You can't do that with the debt ceiling. \u2022 Several Republican senators urged Lew to consider prioritising payments, to create more flexibility. Lew repeatedly dismissed the idea, saying it was politically untenable, possibly impossible in practice, and effectively a default as America would be reneging on its commitments. \u2022 Social Security claimants would be the first to suffer if America couldn't keep borrowing, Lew said, citing the example of his own late mother who relied on hew own cheque from the government. Anyone who thinks freezing social security payments is the answer doesn't understand how the world works, he said. \u2022 There were also a series of Republican warnings that America's real debt crisis is the size of its national debt, and its 'unaffordable entitlement commitments'.One argued that up to 80% of Americans want budget cuts agreed. Lew, though, insists that Congress needs to get a budget agreed and the debt ceiling raised before negotiations can take place. \u2022 Democrats pointed to growing anxiety in the markets. Democrat senator Maria Cantwell showed Lew a graph of rising bond yields, and predicted a stock market crash unless the debt ceiling is reached. \u2022 Lew also revealed that other finance ministers express their worries to him. Overnight, China's premier had expressed his own concern to Secretary of State John Kerry. \u2022 There was also much discussion about a short-term deal to raise the debt limit. Lew said a longer-term deal would be much better -- but any deal is better than none. Shares are romping higher on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones up 205 points (+1.4%) now. The FTSE 100 is also showing triple-digit gains, up 102 points or 1.6%. Traders are calculating that there will be progress at the White House when President Obama and senior Republicans meet. Elsewhere, the oil price has jumped $2 per barrel (Brent crude) - suggesting concern over the US economy being badly hit is easing. Before I round-up the Jack Lew hearing -- Christine Lagarde has been discussing the debt ceiling crisis at a press conference in Washington. Here's the early snaps: 10-Oct-2013 14:46 - IMF'S LAGARDE SAYS U.S. FAILURE TO RAISE DEBT CEILING WOULD CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO U.S., GLOBAL ECONOMY 10-Oct-2013 14:47 - IMF'S LAGARDE SAYS GETS MEMBERSHIP APPROVAL TO TRANSFER GOLD PROFITS TO LOW-INCOME COUNTRY FUND 10-Oct-2013 14:58 - IMF'S LAGARDE SAYS CONFIDENT U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE TAPERING WILL BE WELL-COMMUNICATED, GRADUAL TO TEMPER MARKET TURBULENCE 10-Oct-2013 15:02 - IMF'S LAGARDE SAYS HAS 'NO DOUBT' EUROPEAN PARTNERS WILL STICK BY COMMITMENTS MADE TO HELP GREECE And that really is the end -- and Jack Lew marches briskly out of the room to his next engagement..... Time's up. But no... the committee chair says that there are four senators who haven't spoken. Can they have 10 seconds each? (what is it about Washington politicians and deadlines?) Lew agrees. The senators raise a range of concerns - including the impact on Social Security payments and the damage being caused to the jobs market. Democrat Bill Nelson says that a short-term increase in the debt ceiling was a poor solution that threatens national security. A fourth senator, also a Democrat, also calls for a longer-term deal. Another question, which takes us back to the start of the session. Why won't Lew engage on the issue of 'prioritisation'? America could avoid default by paying some bills and not others. Lew takes another swipe at this idea. No US president has ever had to decide what to pay, and what not. It would put us into default if we could pay one bill and not others. How much damage would there be if America's borrowing costs rose by, say, \"1% or 2%\"? The cost would be billions of US dollars, Lew replies. The Senate committee has hit its own limit -- on time. Jack Lew has to be elsewhere (the IMF annual meeting is also taking place in Washington). Lew tries to get away, saying: I hate to draw attention to the time\u2026.. But the committee wants more, so Lew is going to take two more questions.... Another discussion about whether the real debt problem is the size of America's debt, or Congress's failure to raise the limit. Lew isn't shifting from his position that the ceiling needs to be raised, and that president Obama will negotiate on spending after Congress has met its obligations. He's not negotiating over the debt limit\u2026he looks forward to it being raised. Could a short-term debt ceiling deal (ie, a small rise above the current $16.7trillion limit) give enough certainty to get the American economy moving again? Lew repeats that he would much prefer a long-term deal, cautioning that retailers are concerned about trading in the run-up to Christmas. As he put it: Longer is better, but avoiding a crisis is better than having a crisis. Remember Lew's earlier warning that the Treasury just doesn't know when it might run out of road..... Wall Street is open, and the Dow Jones index is up 144 points, or nearly 1%, in very early trading. Another senator explains that the debt ceiling deadlock will only be fixed when Democrats must accept reforms to entitlement spending, and Republicans must embrace tax reforms. The president must make this crystal clear, and get the two sides together. Republican senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming gives Lew an economics lesson. You can't spend more than you take in, and you can't keep doing it for ever and ever and ever. He cites a constituent who runs a firm in Wyoming. Whenever an employee asks for pay rise he explains that they have an \"a problem with outflow,not income\". (is there no inflation in Wyoming?!) Enzi has had enough of the talk of 'the sky falling in'. Lew replies that the people of Wyoming understand that they need to repay their credit card bills. But refusing to pay obligations is not the answer. Bob Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, says that while Barack Obama was stuck in Washington, China was cutting deals at the Asia-Pacific summit this week. How much damage is being caused to America's role in the world economy? Lew says it is \"impossible to overstate the importance\" of America's central position in the financial system, with the US dollar as the reserve currency. He says that other finance ministers ask him 'what's happening in Washington?', because they're worried about their own economies. Republican senator Pat Roberts, of Kansas, says that 70-80% of Americans favour spending cuts being agreed alongside a new debt ceiling deal. He criticises President Obama for insisting on a clean deal, and asks what sort of compromises the president might be amenable to when he meets with Republican leaders at the White House today. Jack Lew replies that the president's position is clear -- Congress must reopen the government, make sure we can pay our bills, and then we can talk about anything. Democrat senator Maria Cantwell produces a graph of America's short-term borrowing costs (looks like the one-month bond yield ) , showing a spike in interest rates in recent days. She says that people don't realise the implications of America's credit-worthiness being questioned - citing an analyst in her community who predicted a 25% tumble on the stock market if a default looked likely. Lew replies that a tripling of bond yields was not a good thing, but didn't speculate on potential market action. Republican senator Mike Crapo argues that America's real debt crisis is the size of the national debt. Why won't Lew and Obama agree to address its entitlement commitments? Lew replies that the Obama administration has already halved the deficit - from 9% to 4.5%, and even gets criticism from international partners for cutting too fast. Democrat senator Chuck Schumer congratulates Jack Lew on his performance, and for explaining why prioritising payments was a non-starter: The debt ceiling deniers need a dose of debt ceiling reality, and you've given them one today. Schumer says that America is \"like a blindfolded man walking towards a cliff\". We might fall off on October 16th, October 17th, October 25.... but we will fall off. Worse of all, Schumer says, \"we don't know which day we will fall off\". Lew agrees, saying that his biggest fear is that Washington suffers an unexpected event. \"We're already in overtime\" he adds. Lew explains how the day-to-day fiscal management means \"It is impossible to predict with accuracy\" when America will actually run out of money. In Washington there is a parlour game of 'When is the last minute?'. You can't do that with the debt ceiling. Lew also disputes that most recent budget deals have had a debt ceiling rise 'tied to it'. Most budgets either didn't include a debt ceiling, or had it tacked onto the end -- rather than driving the debate. He then takes aim at a \"certain faction\" which prefers the risk of default than not getting its own way, adding: We cannot have the debt ceiling being something that's a threat to the economy unless policy concessions are made. How 'clean' would a debt ceiling have to be to get the Democrat's approval? Lew says he and Obama would need to see it, and adds that a deal that gave more freedom for future borrowing would be better. Lew reminds the committee that US short-term borrowing costs have risen in recent days -- that raises concerns in the financial markets, and also hits the real economy. Next question: America's seniors would be in the front line if America didn't reach a deal - what would the impact be? Lew replies that he can only begin to imagine the impact, telling the senate committee that he has personal experience of this: My late mother lived on her social security cheque.... Anyone who thinks that this is anything short of default has never experienced what it means to live on social security. It's not just those relying on these payments, he adds. Workers are also at risk -- but those relying on government payments would be hit first. All the more reason to avoid a manufactured crisis, he adds. Senator Hatch is now reminding Lew that he believes America needs to make cuts to its unsustainable entitlement spending. Why won't President Obama negotiate? Lew replies that the president is prepared to negotiate.. \"he's been on the verge of an agreement twice.. in 2011\". Obama was prepared to make some challenging decisions, Lew adds. His record on being willing to negotiate is clear. Senator Hatch has the floor, and asks Jack Lew how much of a debt limit increase he wants, and for how long. Lew replies: This economy would benefit from more certainty and less brinkmanship. but it's Congress's decision. Hatch wants to know details. Longer is better, Lew concludes. Lew also warns that the disruption caused by the US government shutdown means he cannot be convinced that his old calculations for how the US finances would play out are still accurate. First question \u2013 how could \"prioritisation\" of America's bills work? Lew insists this is not a sensible idea, saying the first point is: If we don't have enough cash to pay all our bills, we will be failing to meet our obligations. He adds that there is no way of telling how the financial markets would view such a move -- even if it means America met its bond repayments. Lew suggests it would be a very tough task -- saying he didn't know you'd choose social security payment, medicare and food assistance, We wouldn't have money to pay our troops in full, our veterans in full. The legal authority isn't clear, and the administration system might not work, he concludes. That's a thumbs down, folks. Lew also dismisses the idea that America could simply prioritise its payments \"There is no way of knowing the irrevocable damage\" this would have on the markets. This fight is the last thing our economy needs right now, he conclude. Right, onto questions America rolls over $100bn of debt each week, Lew says. If our lenders want the money repaid, rather than rolled over, we've got a problem. If Congress cannot meet its obligations on the debt ceiling, it will cause damage to the US economy, the financial markets, and the \"jobs and savings\" of ordinary Americans, Jack Lew continues. He also reminds the Senate committee that he's been updating Congress on this issue for months. And he reiterates that the extraordinary measures already implemented will run out of road on the 17 October. After that point,we don't have enough money to meet all our obligations, Lew continues, citing social security payments, medicare bills and veteran payments. Jack Lew's now speaking, reading out his prepared statement. Lew says that Congress must act to ensure that America's credit worthiness is not brought into question. The biggest threat to a recovery in our economy is a manufactured political crisis. The uncertainty over the debt ceiling is starting to alarm the financial markets, he continues, citing a recent jump in borrowing costs. The full faith and credit of the United States is one of our greatest assets, he continues. (I'll post a full link to this statement shortly....) Republican senator Hatch also claims that the US government has misled the public by claiming that it would be unprecedented to negotiate over the debt ceiling (by making changes to the Affordable Care act). Hatch adds: The issue we face is yet another debt limit increase. There have been seven since this President came to office...raising the national debt from $11.3trn to $16.7trn. Hatch is also chiding Treasury secretary Lew for suggesting that the markets were too calm about the deadlock, in an apparent attempt to whip up alarm. Jack Lew's hearing at the Senate Finance Committee is underway. Democrat senator Max Baucus spoke first, saying that politicians must put their differences aside today and agree an increase to the debt ceiling. Everyone in the room has an opportunity to get America \"past the brink.\" he added. Republican senator Orrin Hatch is now giving a statement, reminding Lew that Barack Obama, as a humble senator, described an earlier debate over raising the debt ceiling as a sign of leadership failure. Jack Lew's getting ready to testify to Senators on the looming debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew's prepared testimony to the Senate finance committee just hit the wires. Lew is reiterating that America will hit its debt ceiling on 17 October, and warning that there would be a \"substantial effect\" on the markets if America's credit worthiness was called into question. Lew also warns that a \"manufactured political crisis\" is starting to hurt the US economy. 10-Oct-2013 13:00 - U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY LEW SAYS CONGRESS ALONE HAS THE POWER TO MAKE SURE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE U.S. IS NOT CALLED INTO QUESTION 10-Oct-2013 13:02 - LEW SAYS MANUFACTURED POLITICAL CRISIS IS BEGINNING TO DELIVER AN UNNECESSARY BLOW TO OUR ECONOMY 10-Oct-2013 13:02 - LEW: DENIGRATION OF U.S. CREDITWORTHINESS WOULD HAVE SUBSTANTIAL EFFECTS ON THE DOMESTIC FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ON THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR 10-Oct-2013 13:02 - LEW SAYS STILL EXPECTS TO HIT DEBT CEILING BY OCT 17 10-Oct-2013 13:02 - LEW REPEATS THAT OBAMA WILL NOT NEGOTIATE OVER DEBT CEILING 10-Oct-2013 13:02 - LEW SAYS PRIORITIZATION OF DEBT PAYMENTS WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE 10-Oct-2013 13:02 - LEW SAYS UNCERTAINTY AROUND RAISING THE DEBT LIMIT IS BEGINNING TO STRESS FINANCIAL MARKETS 10-Oct-2013 13:02 - LEW SAYS FAILURE TO RAISE DEBT CEILING PUTS AT RISK PAYMENTS TO MEDICARE PROVIDERS, SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFICIARIES, AND VETERANS AND FOR ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY Cyprus's finance minister has declared that his government is aiming for a smaller budget deficit than demanded by its international lenders. Reuters has the details: Cyprus plans spending cuts to achieve a primary budget deficit lower than the level targeted by the bailed-out island's international lenders, its finance minister said on Thursday. Harris Georgiades said the government aimed for a primary budget deficit - which excludes the cost of debt interest - of 3.0% of GDP, compared with 4.25% outlined in the bailout deal. A draft budget for 2014 provides for a 10% cut in net spending compared to 2013, Georgiades told reporters. \"The basic characteristic of the budget is significant savings on expenditure. We are operating in a difficult economic environment,\" he said. While Cyprus hopes for a smaller primary deficit, Greece is confident that it has posted a primary surplus so far this year. That's a key part of its deal with its own lenders. Deputy finance minister Christos Staikouras said earlier today that Greece has managed a surplus of \u20ac2.6bn (before the cost of servicing its debts is included). Back to the US debt ceiling deadlock. The Hong Kong exchange's decision to hike the margin requirement on investors who use short term US debt as collateral is a \"concrete step\" to protect a US default, says the Wall Street Journal. It explains that the move will force traders to put up more security, following signs of stress in the market for Treasury bills. The WSJ also flags up that Hong Kong's regulator financial regulator is considering the implications of a US technical default: Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission, or SFC, which helps to regulate one of the world's biggest financial hubs, is examining how defaulted U.S. treasury securities would affect their use as collateral. The watchdog's talks have included counterparts in Luxembourg and Ireland, where some Hong Kong-authorized funds are domiciled. Securities and Futures Commission Chief Executive Ashley Alder told reporters Thursday that while the chance of a default appears unlikely, regulators need to prepare for the scenario. \"If it did default, it would again expose the simple fact that the chains of intermediated risk around the financial system still exists,\" he said. More here: Hong Kong Takes Concrete Action Against U.S. Default David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), agrees that the Bank of England made the right call, but suggests the quantitative easing programme could be tweaked to help small firms: There is no case for increasing QE at present. Despite the disappointing manufacturing and trade figures this week, the economy is recovering, and adding to QE could risk increasing inflation. While the Bank of England\u2019s balance sheet is sufficiently large, there are strong arguments in favour of changing its composition by replacing some of the gilts with private sector assets such as securitised SME loans. This will make such assets less risky and make it easier for the Bank to increase lending. The news that the Bank of England has left interest rates and its bond-buying programme (QE) unchanged was greeted with a resounding shrug by the City (although with Mark Carney at the helm, a statement couldn't be ruled out). Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight called it a \"stone dead certainty\", but warned that \"a nasty accident on the US debt front\" could easily shake the Bank into action. He writes: The bar for any more QE now looks to be very high. It will likely only occur if the economy loses substantial momentum over the coming months, or if there is major financial turmoil and a sharp upward move in market interest rates when the US Federal Reserve finally starts to taper. Our central scenario is that neither of these events will happen, but neither can be ruled out. Of course if the US defaults on its debt, we could be in a whole different ball game given the likely global economic and financial market turmoil this would cause. In the foreign exchange markets, the pound is pretty flat against the US dollar at $1.5948, and down just 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1784. The Bank of England has left UK interest rates, and its stimulus package, unchanged. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted to leave headline borrowing costs unchanged at 0.5%, and made no changes to its quantitative easing programme. That means it will still hold \u00a3375bn of UK government debt. No sign of a statement from the BoE either..... A political flap is brewing in the Netherlands today as the government tries to agree a deal over an austerity budget for 2014. Finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem (who also chairs the eurogroup) cancelled his trip to Washington for the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting. Instead, he will to focus on reaching an agreement on \u20ac6bn of cutbacks for next year. That budget is in the balance after a second opposition party, the Greens, refused to support the measures last night. Dijsselbloem told national broadcaster NOS today: I will not be going to Washington, as the budget talks have more priority,\" he told national broadcaster NOS. Dijsselbloem's absence is a little awkward, as he was due to represent the eurozone countries at the IMF's gathering. But domestic problems demand his attention, as the Dutch government tries to impose the \u20ac6bn of cuts to get its deficit within 3% of GDP. As Dijsselbloem's spokesman Michel Reijns put it: He regrets the decision, but at the moment he had to give priority to domestic matters It is an attempt to find support for the budget measures. Dijsselbloem spend five hours yesterday talking to opposition leaders, going beyond midnight in an attempt to get a deal. Two parties have already quit the discussions, leaving three - who between them could give the government the votes it needs. Quick reminder that the Bank of England announces its monetary policy decision at noon BST -- economists don't expect any drama though. The excitement could come at 1.30pm BST, when treasury secretary Jack Lew starts testifying on the debt ceiling to the Senate Finance Committee. European stock markets have posted some pretty decent gains today, driven by the overnight reports that a short-term deal to raise the US debt ceiling could be agreed. The main indices are up over 1% each (clawing back some, but not all, of the recent losses). In London the FTSE 100 is up 63 points. We're still expecting Barack Obama to meet with senior Republicans at the White House later today (Marketwatch has more details). Traders suspect that the dime may have fallen on Capitol Hill that they can't risk a technical default. The analyst team at Monex Capital Markets sums it up: Lawmakers in Washington do seem now to be accepting just how big the fall-out would be for both the US and the global economy in the event of the debt ceiling being breached. As such there have been murmurings that a short term increase in the borrowing limit may be on the table, although with a week to run until doomsday, there will doubtless be further political grandstanding to be seen. Hong Kong is firing a 'warning shot' to Washington to sort out the debt ceiling crisis quickly, by hiking the haircut demanded when traders use US debt as collateral, says Brenda Kelly of IG. She writes: Reassurances from the US that short-term measures will be instigated to avert the upcoming debt-ceiling deadline have given European equity markets a jolt upwards, helping to stem some of the risk aversion of the past few days. News that Hong Kong has raised collateral haircuts on US treasury bills appears to be something of a warning shot to US politicians. The implications are that US treasury bonds are considered broadly more risky and the Hong Kong exchange is clearly preparing for the worst case scenario \u2013 a US default. The more likely explanation is that Hong Kong is simply telling the US to get its act together. If so, it's the warning shot heard on trading floors around the world.... Greece's unemployment rate hit 27.6% in July, new data shows, in a stark example of the despair and joblessness which the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is warning about today. That's an increase on June's 27.5% -- revised down from a first estimate of 27.9%. ESTAT reports that there were 3,610,549 people employed in July, and 1,374,054 classed as unemployed. A further 3,375,636 people were 'inactive\". A quarter of men are unemployed, compared to 31% of women. And you already know that the youth jobless rate was awful - for the record, 55.1% of 15-24 year olds were classed as unemployed. The data is seasonally adjusted, and the Hellenic Statistical Authority says it can see signs that the jobless rate may have stopped rising. It said: During the last 3 months we observe a stabilization of the estimated seasonally adjusted unemployment rate. The unadjusted data shows a more erratic picture (reflecting seasonal factors including tourism): Confirmation from Markit that the cost of insuring US 5-year debt against default has fallen, and insuring 1-year debt hasn't risen... The cost of protection against the US government defaulting on a 12-month bond is unchanged this morning, while the cost of insuring five-year Treasuries has actually dropped a little: 10-Oct-2013 10:03 - U.S. 5-YEAR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS FALL 4 BPS ON DAY TO 40 BPS, ONE-YEAR CDS UNCHANGED AT 68 BPS - MARKIT The one-year credit default swaps had been climbing since the US government shutdown began. The Hong Kong exchange has uploaded the official statement, telling traders that it is imposing a larger haircut on short-term US government debt, from 1% to 3%. It's here. Back to America's growing debt ceiling crisis, and the news that Hong Kong securities and future's exchange is treating US short-term bonds as riskier. The Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing (HKEx) is raising the \"haircut\" which traders pay when they use short-term Treasury Bills as collateral, (the Financial Times is reporting). Here's the HKEx statement: This new haircut shall be applied on a daily basis to determine the value of the US Treasuries [sic] allowed to be used as cover for the margin requirements of HKCC [Hong Kong Clearing Corporation] participants. Participants should make necessary funding arrangements to cover any shortfall to their margin requirements resulting from the increase in the US Treasuries haircut. That means they're being treated as less safe -- reflecting the risk that America might stumble into a technical default unless the debt ceiling is raised soon. Here's the FT story: HK exchange prepares for US bond default This comes just hours after the Chinese premier told John Kerry about his concerns over the debt ceiling deadlock (see opening post). Is Beijing sending a signal to Washington to get a grip? Ian Traynor also filed a devastating piece on the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies's report into the damage caused by European austerity. When speaking privately, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is fond of wrinkling her nose and indicating her distaste for a word that does not really exist in her own language \u2013 austerity. It is a word that has dominated her years at the helm of the eurozone crisis. She has heard it a lot. She does not like it. But the spending cuts, \"structural reforms\", slashed budgets, decimated public services and wrenching social and cultural upheavals imposed on Europe's fringes over the past four years to save the euro are a result of the austerity that has been the \"made in Germany\" policy response to the troubles. Merkel and her fellow leaders in northern Europe and in Brussels are already mildly sanguine that they have weathered the worst of the euro-storm. The markets are calm. The banks, whose irresponsible lending spree did much to produce the crisis in the first place, are raking in squillions, the bulk of the hundreds of billions in bailout funds lent by the eurozone since 2010. Crisis over? Not in the real economy, where it may just really be beginning. Here's the full piece: Crisis over in the eurozone? Not in the real world A major report published today is warning that the austerity measures imposed in Europe since the debt crisis began are creating a deep social and economic decline. In a detailed survey, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies warns that tens of millions of Europeans face years of gloom and despair, painting a picture of growing poverty, mass unemployment, and social exclusion. The full scale of the crisis is not yet clear, it warns. In a critique which should send shivers through Brussels and the corridors of European power, the report states bleakly that: Whilst other continents successfully reduce poverty, Europe adds to it. European editor Ian Traynor reports: The damning critique, obtained exclusively by the Guardian, of the policy response to the debt crisis that surfaced in Greece in late 2009 and raised fundamental questions about the viability of the euro single currency, foresees extremely gloomy prospects for tens of millions of Europeans. Mass unemployment \u2013 especially among the young, 120 million Europeans living in or at risk of poverty \u2013 increased waves of illegal immigration clashing with rising xenophobia in the host countries, growing risks of social unrest and political instability estimated to be two to three times higher than most other parts of the world, greater levels of insecurity among the traditional middle classes \u2013 all combine to make a European future more uncertain than at any time in the postwar era. \"As the economic crisis has planted its roots, millions of Europeans live with insecurity, uncertain about what the future holds. This is one of the worst psychological states of mind for human beings. We see quiet desperation spreading among Europeans, resulting in depression, resignation and loss of hope. Compared to 2009, millions more find themselves queuing for food, unable to buy medicine nor access healthcare. Millions are without a job and many of those who still have work face difficulties to sustain their families due to insufficient wages and skyrocketing prices. Austerity pushing Europe into social and economic decline, says Red Cross And here's our full story: SSE raises prices by 8.2% \u2013 adding \u00a3104 to average bill Labour was quick to use SSE's energy price rise as proof that bill should be frozen. Caroline Flint MP, Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary, also said: Hard-pressed consumers are now paying the price for David Cameron's failure to stand up to the energy companies. When times are tough energy companies should be helping their customers not hitting them with more price rises to boost their profits. That's why a Labour Government would freeze energy prices and reset Britain's energy market to stop people being ripped off. Energy price rises were a big issue at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday. Cameron claimed the Labour price freeze is a 'gimmick' and that it supports Green initiatives that would push prices even higher, while Miliband said the PM had no answer on the issue: Ed Miliband turns up heat on David Cameron over energy bills In the UK, energy prices have come roaring back up the political agenda after SSE became the first supplier to hike prices. SSE announced the 8.2% tariff increase this morning, which will slap another \u00a3100 or so on the average annual dual-fuel bill. The move comes just a fortnight after Labour leader Ed Miliband promised a price freeze if he wins the next election. SSE said it was \"sorry\", and tried to pin the blame on wholesale price increase and government tariffs. There's a long explanation here, in which Will Morris, SSE's retail group managing director, said: We're sorry we have to do this. We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year. Eighty five per cent of a typical energy bill is made up of costs outside our direct control and these costs have increased. So far this year we have made a loss from supplying energy as a result of the higher costs we have been facing and continue to face. No-one wants to be seen as the energy company's friend right now. Business minister Michael Fallon took to Sky News to encourage SSE customers to \"consider switching to a cheaper tariff\": European stock markets are up in early trading, on hopes that America's politicians may bow to the growing pressure and agree some sort of deal. If only a temporary one. Last night, a Republican aide hinted that the party might be amenable to a short-term increase in the government's borrowing authority, and discussing broader policy measures over a longer timeframe. That idea could move forward tonight, when Barack Obama meets Republican leaders at the White House. FTSE 100: up 35 points at 6373, +0.56% German DAX: up 55 points at 8572, + 0.66% French CAC: up 35 points at 4162, + 0.87% Spanish IBEX: up 104 points at 9,542, + 1.1% Italian FTSE MIB: up 240 point at 18,795 + 1.3% China isn't the only country worried that America is about to trigger a global panic by not raising its debt ceiling. The looming deadline has cast a shadow over a summit of Southeast Asian nations in Brunei. President Obama was meant to be there too \u2013 but remained in Washington to try to drive a budget deal, and debt ceiling increase, through Congress. The Financial Times flags up that the Philippines says it's now taking a \u201cdefensive position\u201d to protect itself in the case of a US debt default. \u201cThe Philippines government is aware of the possibility; we\u2019re taking steps to protect our position and ensure that the effects of this will be as little as possible,\u201d said a spokesman for Benigno Aquino, the country\u2019s president. \u201cBut this is something that\u2019s never happened before and so we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to affect the entire world and what it can do to us.\u201d He refused to elaborate, saying he that did not want to \u201ccreate more nervousness about the situation\u201d. Last night it emerged that Fidelity, America's largest money market mutual fund manager, had sold all its Short-Term U.S. Government Debt which matured in late October or early November - just in case there was a default. Bond trading giant Pimco, though, says it's buying Treasury bills.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. It's the tenth day of the US government shutdown, and patience with Washington's inability to either pass a budget or agree to raise its debt ceiling before the 17 October deadline is running out. Overnight, China has gone public again with its concerns. Chinese premier Li Keqiang warned Secretary of State John Kerry that Beijing is worried about the U.S. debt-ceiling issue . A brief statement in English on State-run China News Service reported that Li expressed Beijing's concern about Washington' s debt-ceiling problem. The comments come as BAE Systems, the defence contractor, fired a warning shot at America this morning, warning shareholders that the ongoing uncertainty had already forced it to send over a thousand workers home. In a statement to the City, BAE explains that it's already feeling the impact of the partial US government shutdown. Whilst the impact of this action has not yet been material to the Group's overall financial performance, some progressive impact to the Group's US operations would result from a protracted government shutdown. Since the 1 October shutdown, approximately 1,200 employees across the Intelligence &amp; Security and Support Solutions businesses have been temporarily directed not to report to work. BAE's warning comes amid signs of optimism that politicians on Capitol Hill might hammer out a deal before America crashes into its debt ceiling, potentially derailing the world economy. That's expected to push shares high in Europe today. CMC's Market's Michael Hewson reports: Even allowing for this slightly positive finish concerns about the ongoing deadlock on Capitol Hill remain close to hand, though there does appear to be some optimism that discussions are still ongoing with the President due to meet 20 senior Republicans this evening in an attempt to break the deadlock. There has been some talk of a short term debt cap bill with neither side ruling this option out in order to buy more time to come to a more permanent agreement. Lots more afoot today, including Treasury Secretary Jack Lew testifying at the Senate on the debt ceiling deadlock, and the Bank of England's interest rate decision at noon.....",

      "bodyText": "The Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, warned on Thursday that the continued brinksmanship over the debt limit risks unforeseen consequences in the financial markets that could in turn lead to the US running out of cash within days. As pressure mounted on Congress to cut a deal before next Thursday's deadline for extending the federal debt limit, Lew accused Republicans of underestimating the danger of inadvertently triggering a stampede among investors that could rapidly drain remaining reserves. More than $100bn of the US debt, known as Treasury bonds, is typically reissued every week as investors roll over their loans to the government. Typically this process is routine and does not add to the $17tn US debt pile, but simply refinances a portion of it.

Republican aides said on Thursday that House speaker John Boehner will ask House Republicans to approve a short-term extension of the government's ability to borrow to meet its bills. Boehner is due to meet Obama for fresh talks on Thursday afternoon and is expected to urge his conservative colleagues to act before the government runs out of borrowing authority next week. Republicans have been insistent that budget cuts and other measures be added to the so-called debt ceiling legislation but the aides wouldn't say whether he'll seek to add other material to the measure. The aides required anonymity to reveal the information before Boehner makes an announcement after a closed-door meeting with his GOP colleagues. Lew warned that if they failed to reach a deal it would be impossible to \"prioritise\" certain bills due next \u2013 as some Republicans have urged \u2013 because computer systems made it impossible to selectively refuse some spending obligations but not others. \"Between October 17 and November 1, we have large payments to Medicare providers, social security beneficiaries, and veterans, as well as salaries for active duty members of the military,\" he said. \"A failure to raise the debt limit could put timely payment of all of these at risk.\" Some Republicans on the committee accused Lew of exaggerating the risks of debt limit breach compared the broader problems of excessive debt.

      "bodyText": "Mobile networks are facing a fivefold increase in the cost of renting spectrum from the government, amid warnings that the price hikes will be passed on to customers and hamper investment in 4G. Annual licence fees will be ramped to \u00a3309m a year, up from the current annual total of \u00a364.4m, under proposals published on Thursday by the telecoms regulator Ofcom. The fees apply to spectrum that was given away by the government in the early years of the mobile phone industry, before the 3G auction attracted bids worth billions. The government wants a price hike from next year, to reflect the value of a scarce resource that has become essential in the age of the smartphone, but there are concerns that customers could pay a high price for the Treasury's windfall. \"The size of these figures may come as a shock to the mobile networks, but more worryingly could sound alarm bells for consumers,\" said Adam Kirby, telecoms expert at the price comparison site uSwitch. \"The proposed new costs reflect a huge leap in the amount networks will have to pay the regulator for using the spectrum. Our concern is that it will be mobile users who are left to foot the bill, and it isn't clear if there will be any direct benefits to them. In fact, providers will no doubt be concerned that their investment in network infrastructure will be limited if they are shelling out more for licence fees.\" Ofcom may face a fightback from networks, which have threatened the regulator with legal action over past decisions. Privately, they say the rollout of 4G to rural areas would be affected. While most are promising that their signal will give indoor coverage in 98% of UK premises by 2015, rural speeds could be slower because there will be less invested in the wireless or fibre links that connect mobile phone masts to the internet. \"There must be a balance between licence fees and the critical 4G network investment consumers and businesses are demanding to drive growth and jobs for the UK economy,\" said EE. \"The proposed increase in licence fees is excessive at a time when we are investing heavily in the rollout of 4G.\" O2 and Vodafone are facing the biggest price rises: Ofcom is proposing their more valuable holdings should attract a 433% price increase, from \u00a315.6m a year to \u00a383.1m. Both companies have spectrum in the 900 Megahertz (MHz) range, which travels further and therefore requires fewer masts. EE and Three, whose holdings are in the less valuable 1800MHz range, could nonetheless see their licence fees rise by 330%. As the larger network with the biggest spectrum holding of all the UK's operators, EE could be paying \u00a3107.1m a year. Three would pay \u00a335.7m.

However the latest Fed minutes released on Wednesday showed the central bank's members split on whether to begin tapering its monthly bond buying. In the end they decided to leave the $85bn programme in place.</p> <p>With further meetings in the US planned to discuss the deadlock, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has added 53.17 points to 6391.08. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets,</p> <blockquote> Another mixed session in Asia [followed] a late bounce in the US to close just positive, amid speculation that both sides in Washington could be working towards a budget deal comprising a short-term raising of the debt ceiling by Friday, to release the nation's government from its partial shutdown and avoid a possible technical sovereign default. Are Republicans finally softening on Obamacare? <br> The Federal Reserve minutes were interesting in the split on tapering (those for fearing loss of credibility, those against saying economy not ready and political/fiscal/financial headwinds), but still aiming for 2013 tapering and 2014 end. Note the minutes are from September's meeting before the Washington impasse took hold, so views likely changed given impact on fourth quarter GDP. </blockquote> <p>Among the risers <strong>GKN</strong> has added 7.1p to 350.3p after poaching Adam Walker from media group <strong>Informa</strong> as its new finance director to replace the retiring William Seeger. Informa has fallen 9p to 501p. But Panmure Gordon issued a buy note on Informa, saying that with the departure of Walker and the retirement of chief executive Peter Rigby, the chances of a break-up had increased:</p> <blockquote> Rigby and Walker, to a lesser extent, were the architects of the current group conglomerate structure/strategy. Rational break-up values should yield valuations of more than 600p, in our view. There is no suggestion that either of these departures is trading-related. <br> </blockquote> <p>Ian Whittaker at Liberum Capital took the oppositive view.

      "bodyText": "After three days of falls, markets are edging higher on hopes a resolution to the US budget and debt ceiling deadlock can be found. On top of that, investors were comforted by confirmation that President Obama had nominated the dovish Janet Yellen as the successor to Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. However the latest Fed minutes released on Wednesday showed the central bank's members split on whether to begin tapering its monthly bond buying. In the end they decided to leave the $85bn programme in place. With further meetings in the US planned to discuss the deadlock, the FTSE 100 has added 53.17 points to 6391.08. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, Another mixed session in Asia [followed] a late bounce in the US to close just positive, amid speculation that both sides in Washington could be working towards a budget deal comprising a short-term raising of the debt ceiling by Friday, to release the nation's government from its partial shutdown and avoid a possible technical sovereign default. Are Republicans finally softening on Obamacare? The Federal Reserve minutes were interesting in the split on tapering (those for fearing loss of credibility, those against saying economy not ready and political/fiscal/financial headwinds), but still aiming for 2013 tapering and 2014 end. Note the minutes are from September's meeting before the Washington impasse took hold, so views likely changed given impact on fourth quarter GDP. Among the risers GKN has added 7.1p to 350.3p after poaching Adam Walker from media group Informa as its new finance director to replace the retiring William Seeger. Informa has fallen 9p to 501p. But Panmure Gordon issued a buy note on Informa, saying that with the departure of Walker and the retirement of chief executive Peter Rigby, the chances of a break-up had increased: Rigby and Walker, to a lesser extent, were the architects of the current group conglomerate structure/strategy. Rational break-up values should yield valuations of more than 600p, in our view. There is no suggestion that either of these departures is trading-related. Ian Whittaker at Liberum Capital took the oppositive view. In a sell note he said: Whatever the reason [for Walker leaving], it is not positive. To us, it also suggests that a short-term break-up of Informa is unlikely (we think Mr Walker would have stayed around to guide this). BAE Systems has climbed 4.3p to 444.3p after a positive update, although it warned that earnings could be hit by 6p to 7p if it fails to reach agreement on pricing with Saudi Arabia over the purchase of 72 Eurofighter Typhoon jets. It also said the US government shutdown had only made a slight impact so far - it had told some 1,200 workers not to come in - but its operations in the country could be harder hit if there is no resolution. Energy group SSE has risen 10p to \u00a314.64 as it became the first supplier to raise prices, up by an average 8.2% next month, and risking a political backlash. Standard Chartered is up 6p to \u00a314.42 despite analysts at Berenberg putting a sell rating on the shares and cutting their target price from \u00a312 to \u00a314.50, saying the bank may have to issue $6bn if new capital in the future.

      "bodyText": "The super-rich who own mansions through offshore companies face new rules forcing them to declare if they are trying to avoid tax, a Treasury minister will announce. Ministers are planning to close a loophole with immediate effect, amid fears wealthy property owners are already trying to find ways round a new annual levy of up to \u00a3140,000 on houses owned through companies. The charge on so called \"enveloped dwellings\" was brought in by George Osborne, the chancellor, to raise money from people who are able to avoid stamp duty by conducting transactions through companies, rather than in their own names. It imposes an annual tax of between \u00a315,000 and \u00a3140,000 on mansions worth more than \u00a32m and registered in the name of a company. The tax comes into force this year but there are fears promoters of tax avoidance schemes will be able to work around it to get their clients off paying the charge. Under the changes coming into force on Thursday, anyone using a scheme designed to avoid paying the annual tax on \"enveloped dwellings\" will have to tell HM Revenue and Customs. Anyone failing to do so would face a \u00a31,000 fine for each non-disclosure. David Gauke, the exchequer secretary, said the government is moving to clamp down on businesses that try to promote aggressive tax avoidance. \"This government has been clear \u2013 aggressive tax avoidance is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. The regulations we are laying down mark a significant strengthening of the rules and build on the considerable work we have done to tackle not only tax avoidance schemes but also the promoters of these schemes. \"HMRC has been well resourced to tackle tax avoidance and has made it clear that they will pursue those who attempt to avoid their responsibilities.\" In another move to tackle the problem, promoters of avoidance schemes will be forced to provide HMRC with details of their client's national insurance number and unique taxpayer reference. Treasury sources said this will make it much easier for the taxman to investigate avoiders. A promoter of a scheme that fails to declare it could be fined up to \u00a31m. It will also make it harder to avoid tax by using so-called \"disguised remuneration schemes\" which are designed to avoid tax and national insurance on employment income. Announcing the new \"enveloped dwelling\" charge in April last year, Osborne described the use of companies to buy residential property as a \"major source of abuse that rouses the anger of many of our citizens\". Many properties in London's most exclusive developments are owned through companies.
