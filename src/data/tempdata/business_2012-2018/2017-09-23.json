      "bodyText": "An unprecedented run without interest rate rises has fuelled house price rices and record levels of debt. But while the Reserve Bank is signalling the end of rate cuts, that level of debt and ongoing low wages growth means a rate rise might still be some months away. It has now been 82 months since the Reserve Bank last increased the cash rate. It is fair to say things have changed in the nearly seven years since November 2010. Back then the RBA was raising the cash rate to 4.75%, and now it is just 1.5%. It was a time when the average discount mortgage rate was 7.15%; now it is 4.45%. What difference does that make? If you have a $400,000 mortgage, that is the difference between paying $2,702 a month in mortgage payments and paying just $2,015 \u2013 over $8,000 less in mortgage payments over the course of the year. But that extra money is unlikely to increase. In a speech this week in Perth, the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, let everyone know that the days of interest rate cuts are at an end. Lowe told his audience that while \u201cmonetary policy can make for a more predictable investment climate by keeping inflation low and stable\u201d he also noted that \u201cbeyond these effects, monetary policy has little influence on the economy\u2019s potential growth rate\u201d. Rather, he suggested \u201cother forces that are likely to be more important in shaping the next chapter of the Australian economy\u201d \u2013 other forces being changes in technology, and growth from the USA and Asia. That is not the statement of a man who wants the market and consumers to think he is about to cut interest rates in order to get growth going. One major problem for the RBA in cutting rates is while it might create some economic growth, it would almost certainly bolster a housing market that finally appears to be slowing in Sydney and Melbourne. The latest residential housing price data out this week by the ABS showed the annual growth of house prices in all capital cities except Hobart is slowing: The figures line up with the slowing of growth of housing finance in the past six months. If the pattern of house prices following housing finance continues, the annual growth of housing prices should begin to fall: For those in Sydney looking to buy that would be a blessed relief. The ABS also found that in June the median house price in Sydney was $1.02m. Even using a rolling 12-month average price of $965,400, that comes to a 70% increase since the RBA started cutting rates at the end of 2011 \u2013 nearly double that of Melbourne: In December 2011, the median Sydney house price was 15% higher than in Melbourne \u2013 now it is 42% higher. So it really should be some relief for many in Sydney that the RBA is no longer talking about cutting rates. But with that relief comes the fear for those who are homeowners of what will happen if rates rise. Predictably, the market is taking Lowe\u2019s words to mean a rate rise is on the books. The market is currently pricing in a rate rise by the middle of next year and a second one early in 2019: Now of course the market is often wrong on these things, but there has been a marked shift in expectations since June, when there was no sign of a rate rise at all, and even since July when investors first started thinking the era of interest rate cuts was over. But one reason the market might be a bit over-eager in believing a rate rise is on the way is the note of concern Lowe raised about the large levels of debt Australians now hold. He noted that \u201cover recent times, Australians have borrowed a lot to purchase housing\u201d and that \u201cthis has added to the upward pressure on housing prices, especially in our two largest cities\u201d. While he suggested that \u201cAustralians are coping well with the higher level of debt\u201d he also noted that \u201cthe very high levels of housing prices in our largest cities are also making it difficult for those on low and middle incomes to buy their own home\u201d. One of the issues of greater debt is that a rate rise now would have a much greater impact on household income than it did in the past. The median price of a house in Sydney in December 2011 was $567,000. The average discount mortgage rate at the time was 6.55%. It meant your mortgage payment, if you had paid a 20% deposit, was $2,881 a month. Due to the interest cuts, that would now be $2,284. So yes, you are very much better off. But what about if you had bought a house in June this year at the median price? Even with a 20% deposit and the low discount mortgage rate of 4.45%, your monthly repayments are $3,891. Little wonder the latest household expenditure survey by the ABS saw a jump in the proportion of weekly spending going to mortgage payments: Yes interest rates are lower, but the price of houses \u2013 especially in Sydney and Melbourne \u2013 is so much greater that unless you bought before the price boom, your mortgage payments are higher now than had you bought back then. So the Reserve Bank knows that while another rate cut will create more debt, a rate rise will hurt because of the debt levels already in existence. And while the RBA is optimistic about economic growth both here and overseas, just because the economy is growing solidly doesn\u2019t mean rates necessarily need to increase. The lack of inflation both in the cost of goods and services and in our wages is a block to increasing rates \u2013 why lift rates to curb inflation when there is none? Since the global financial crisis the cash rate has moved pretty much in line with wages growth: The latest minutes of the monthly RBA board meeting also noted that the bank continues to hold a \u201cforecast for growth in wages to remain low for some time\u201d. Would the RBA really increase rates while real wages are flat? If you do have a home loan you should of course be budgeting for a rate rise. In July Lowe suggested a cash rate two percentage points higher than the current rate was the \u201cneutral\u201d position the RBA would like to get back to one day. So you could do worse than budget for a two point increase to your mortgage rate happening at some point. But while economic growth, non-mining business and employment is improving, if inflation and wages growth remains at record lows and debt is at record highs, the RBA is going to be pretty cautious about raising rates.",

Growers faced the prospect of having to throw away apples from this autumn\u2019s crop after an unseasonal frost caused unsightly blemishes on otherwise perfectly good fruit. The Bramley cooking apple crop has been particularly badly hit. When temperatures dropped to -4C in April it caused a blemish known as \u201cfrost ring\u201d, which leaves a mark around the circumference or large marks on the skin of the apples. Under rules set by supermarkets about the look and quality of fruit and vegetables provided by suppliers, growers feared retailers would reject this year\u2019s crop. Now Tesco has said it will relax the normally tight specifications on how fruit looks to ensure the crop goes on sale. Growers said the move will mean that a variety of apples, including an estimated 300 tonnes of Bramleys, could now be sold by supermarkets. Under the existing rules, apples affected by frost ring would normally be excluded and growers forced to remove those with the defect. John Worth, Tesco\u2019s apple spokesman, said: \u201cWe\u2019re working with our apple growers to use as much of the crop and prevent perfectly good fruit from going to waste. We work with our growers wherever we can and although some apples might be smaller or blemished, they will have the same great taste our customers expect.\u201d He said the slightly blemished apples would be sold as part of Tesco\u2019s standard range, while more blemished fruit will be sold under its Perfectly Imperfect \u201cwonky\u201d fruit and vegetable branding. Supermarkets have faced criticism for being too exacting in their rules about how fruit and vegetables look before being accepted for sale. Retailers argue the rules reflect customer tastes for blemish-free produce and claim there is little point in putting imperfect goods on sale only to throw them away unsold later. Apple growers welcomed the move, saying the frost ring damage was largely superficial with a minimal effect on the flesh. A spokesman for the British Fruit Growers\u2019 Association said retailers\u2019 rules had a big impact on grower\u2019s profits and praised Tesco\u2019s stance.

      "bodyText": "Ryanair passengers unhappy with the Irish airline\u2019s no-frills service can usually expect little sympathy, and sometimes public scorn, from its chief executive. Michael O\u2019Leary revels in a self-drawn image as the enfant terrible of aviation, whether it\u2019s calling passengers \u201cstupid\u201d or giving them short shrift if they want a refund. However, even O\u2019Leary was forced to apologise to customers last week after what he admitted was a \u201cmess-up\u201d, when a pilot rostering error led to cancellation of up to 50 flights a day over six weeks, affecting 315,000 passengers. Ryanair boasts three characteristics that have yielded ever higher passenger numbers: it is cheap, it is reliable and it knows how to make a virtue of publicity, whether good or bad. In the space of a week, each of these pillars of strength has begun to buckle under the strain of a self-inflicted problem that has put the company on a collision course with thousands of staff. This alone is not enough to clip the wings of Europe\u2019s largest airline, a continent-straddling behemoth set to carry 131 million passengers this year. \u201cEven if those [affected] passengers don\u2019t come back, it won\u2019t knock them,\u201d says John Strickland, director of independent transport consultancy JLS Consulting. \u201cTheir pace of growth is phenomenal. Adding 30 planes a year or so is normal for them, but it\u2019s like creating several new airlines for anyone else.\u201d Nonetheless, the longer-term ramifications of the scheduling blunder now pose the first genuine threat in years to a business that has proved to be an unstoppable force. Widespread flight cancellations \u2013 and the associated tales of passenger woe \u2013 undermine Ryanair\u2019s prized reputation for getting passengers from A to B, albeit while trying to sell them scratchcards on the way. Only a small percentage of passengers were affected, but Ryanair displayed unusual naivety in announcing the problem on a Friday night but failing to release details of cancellations until Monday. Millions of passengers were left fretting needlessly, a memory likely to be associated in their minds with the Ryanair name for some time to come. \u201cRyanair\u2019s brand isn\u2019t strong because everything it does is great,\u201d says Dan Gavshon Brady, lead strategist at brand consultancy Wolff Olins. \u201cIts brand is strong because it has a clear proposition: it\u2019ll get you to your destination on time and for a low fare. Not only are these cancellations costing people time and money \u2013 always bad for customer satisfaction \u2013 they totally contradict the very strengths the Ryanair brand plays on.\u201d Most seriously of all, the Dublin-based airline could find its low-cost model under threat from a nascent insurrection among pilots and cabin crew, as the rostering snafu brings a simmering rancour bubbling to the surface. Many pilots rejected O\u2019Leary\u2019s offer of a tax-free bonus of up to \u00a312,000 to resolve its scheduling problems by flying during their time off. He reacted by claiming he could force them to defer leave, as well as questioning their work ethic and talent. Now pilots across Europe have begun to talk about industrial action, some joining unions and others gathering in informal collectives. They sense that for the first time in decades, their position is stronger than that of their employer. Irish pilots\u2019 union Ialpa says more than 700 pilots \u2013 a sizeable proportion of the 4,200 who fly for Ryanair \u2013 have quit this year. If you\u2019re in the cockpit, it\u2019s a seller\u2019s market. According to letters seen by the Observer, a growing number of them are prepared to hold O\u2019Leary\u2019s feet to the fire to secure improved employment terms. Ryanair\u2019s rigorous cost control, which allows it to keep prices low, is partly based on employing pilots by way of third-party agencies. This structure, unpopular with many pilots, limits social security costs and helps Ryanair make the most efficient possible use of its labour force. One former Ryanair pilot told the Observer that the airline\u2019s staff might not realise how much power they could wield if they refused to co-operate. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to buy tickets on an airline that cancels 10% of its flights,\u201d he said. \u201cIf pilots can convince them there will be industrial action, O\u2019Leary\u2019s back would be against the wall and he\u2019ll have to acquiesce.\u201d Cabin crew have also been emboldened by Ryanair\u2019s travails. Informal groups have sprung up via social media, and crew, while wary of a backlash from the airline, are discussing various forms of industrial action. Usually, O\u2019Leary prides himself on masterful control of both Ryanair\u2019s operational efficiency and its public image, but for once he appears to have lost his grip. \u201cI\u2019ve been following him for a very long time and I\u2019ve not heard him sound as contrite as he did this week,\u201d says HSBC aviation analyst Andrew Lobbenberg. \u201cHe\u2019s not fully in control of the news agenda.\u201d If staff are successful in forcing concessions out of O\u2019Leary, says Lobbenberg, it will hit the company\u2019s tightly controlled cost base. \u201cRyanair benefits from the lack of unionisation and that\u2019s a significant competitive advantage. If there\u2019s a path to labour organising, it\u2019s really significant,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the other hand, we modelled a 20% increase in unit labour costs as an estimation and that impacted Ryanair\u2019s profitability by 12%. It\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s not devastating the business model.\u201d Strickland acknowledges that the rostering error has been a \u201cdifferent\u201d challenge, one that Ryanair cannot allow to continue for long. But he backs the company and its boss to come out the other side in good shape. \u201cThey\u2019re such a determined bunch of people, and have such big profits, that I think they\u2019ll invest resources and there won\u2019t be a repeat.\u201d Nor does he believe that O\u2019Leary is likely to go the way of other charismatic chief executives who became synonymous with the companies they built before being ousted when successive blunders got too much. O\u2019Leary, says Strickland, has more staying power than that. \u201cThere\u2019s always a risk with a high-profile chief executive, but he is someone who understands operational detail. \u201cHe\u2019s very well-regarded by the investment community. He knows how to speak their language and he doesn\u2019t disappoint.\u201d That has been true until now, but while O\u2019Leary\u2019s wits have never failed him before, he has appeared unusually rattled in public appearances during the past week. Now he must test those wits against the massed ranks of the staff upon whom he relies. It could be the defining challenge of a colourful career. A SHORT HISTORY OF CHEAP FLYING Michael O\u2019Leary is the public face of low-cost flying, but not its pioneer. The template for budget airlines was set up more than 40 years ago by Herb Kelleher, founder of Dallas-based Southwest Airlines. He had four principles: fly one type of plane to keep down engineering costs; keep overheads low; turn aircraft around as quickly as possible; and forget loyalty or air miles schemes. O\u2019Leary and Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of easyJet, followed Kelleher\u2019s blueprint in the mid-1990s, when European air travel was liberalised. Traditional airlines did not feel threatened at first, but the dip in air travel in the wake of the 11 September attacks exposed their heavy cost bases. Some established players went out of business, ceding further ground to the budget carriers. The story since then has been one of inexorable growth for budget carriers - and a tweaking of Kelleher\u2019s model. Charging for food and hold baggage is now taken for granted, while seat reservation fees are now levied across the industry. However, some of O\u2019Leary\u2019s more innovative ideas have yet to see the light of day. In 2010 he even suggested getting rid of \u201cunnecessary\u201d co-pilots and using just one pilot on each flight. He said: \u201cIt could save the entire industry a fortune. In 25 years, with over about 10 million flights, we have had one pilot who suffered a heart attack in flight, and he landed the plane.\u201d The idea, which is against international regulations, never took off. Other O\u2019Leary suggestions include: introducing standing-only areas on flights; charging passengers to use the toilet; and putting customers in the hold. None of these was ever implemented by the airline but regular flyers should watch out - charging for food on board was unthinkable a few decades ago.",

    "webTitle": "Transport chaos looms as rail unions widen strikes over driver-only trains", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pity British commuters this autumn. In southern England, Merseyside, East Anglia and the east coast main line they will face a wave of disruption after strikes were announced for Tuesday 3 October and Thursday 5 October. London Underground will also face disruption on the later date. Privately, the rail workers\u2019 union, the RMT, and drivers\u2019 union Aslef believe they can win improved pay and conditions for their members and ensure the safety of the travelling public as rail firms attempt to introduce trains without guards. This could all be in place by now, they argue, if the government \u2013 and in particular, transport secretary Chris Grayling \u2013 had given rail firms a free hand to negotiate. But according to the RMT, the rail workers\u2019 union, the \u201cdead hand\u201d of Grayling has halted progress. RMT and Aslef are used to fighting disputes in the public eye and the walkouts have been meticulously planned for maximum political effect. They will coincide with the Conservative party\u2019s annual conference in Manchester and follow proposed action by public sector unions including the PCS and the POA over the government\u2019s refusal to lift the pay cap. These disputes also underline how difficult it is to modernise industries when technological progress appears to pose a direct threat to jobs. Industrial action is planned at Southern Rail, Merseyrail, Arriva Rail North and Greater Anglia in a row over the introduction of driver-only operated trains. The abolition of conductors is deemed unacceptable by rail unions, who are well aware that driverless trains could be the next development. An RMT spokesman said that after Southern Rail, Merseyrail, Arriva Rail North and Greater Anglia failed to engage properly in talks, he suspected the involvement of the transport secretary: \u201cWe believe that the dead hand of Chris Grayling has been at work. This is not normal in terms of industrial relations. Our belief is that it is politically driven by the DfT.\u201d Economically driven might be more apt. The government is tired of pumping billions into Network Rail, the owner of Britain\u2019s tracks and stations, and wants costs to be held down across the industry. It doesn\u2019t take long for that sort of agenda to clash directly with unions. The RMT official added that Abellio, the Dutch government-owned company which has the Anglia franchise, last year reached an agreement with the RMT in Scotland in a similar dispute, but is not sitting down with the union now. \u201cHow come Abellio was able to strike a deal over Scotrail, but can\u2019t do it on Anglia? If it was great deal there, why not here? Is it because the government wants train operators to take a stand?\u201d Nonetheless, there are signs that the most divisive dispute \u2013 on Southern, Britain\u2019s busiest commuter franchise \u2013 is not intractable. The negotiations with Southern, involving both rail unions, took a new turn last Thursday when Aslef claimed it was close to a deal. Details of the talks were withheld, but a joint statement said \u201csignificant progress\u201d had been made in discussions between the union and Govia Thameslink. But this will probably come at a cost to intra-union relations. Tensions between Aslef and the RMT have increased over the past year. RMT officials are furious that Aslef negotiators have sought a preferential deal for their members behind the backs of fellow trade unionists. Aslef members have already rejected two offers recommended by the union \u2014 both of which offered concessions in exchange for drivers taking responsibility for closing train doors. This leaves RMT in the familiar position of being public enemy number one for the franchise owners. They claim that RMT is on a \u201cnational crusade\u201d to gain more money and power for its members. Operators argue that driver-only operation (DOO) was introduced on the Bedford-St Pancras line in 1982 and has spread to about 30% of the UK mainline network, as well as London Underground, and results in a more efficient system. The RMT insists that operating with a guard is superior to DOO on safety grounds. In a dossier prepared last June, the union asked: \u201cWith the [DOO] model being nothing new, it is right to ask why, if it is so safe, has it been adopted by less than a third of the network? The answer is that it is unsafe, and unpopular with the public.\u201d Southern said: \u201cWe are disappointed by this unnecessary action and the RMT\u2019s continued refusal to engage with us in modernising the railway. Last strike, we ran a normal service on most routes but passengers will inevitably be affected in places and we deeply regret any inconvenience these strikes will cause.\u201d The rail minister, Paul Maynard, accused the RMT of \u201cplaying political games\u201d over the Southern dispute. He said: \u201cOn Southern, performance has been significantly better this year but this can only improve if industrial action by the trade unions stops. This is not about safety, as the regulator has ruled that driver-controlled trains are safe. No one is losing their job or any pay as a result of the changes being put in place.\u201d The heyday for UK rail industry investment, which came after the Labour government created Network Rail from the ashes of Railtrack, is a distant era. As franchise owners and the government look for ways to save money, British commuters should be braced for more strikes. The headline of this story was amended on 23 September to \u201cdriver-only trains\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Pity British commuters this autumn. In southern England, Merseyside, East Anglia and the east coast main line they will face a wave of disruption after strikes were announced for Tuesday 3 October and Thursday 5 October. London Underground will also face disruption on the later date.</p> <p>Privately, the rail workers\u2019 union, the RMT, and drivers\u2019 union Aslef believe they can win improved pay and conditions for their members and ensure the safety of the travelling public as rail firms attempt to introduce trains without guards.</p> <p>This could all be in place by now, they argue, if the government \u2013 and in particular, transport secretary Chris Grayling \u2013 had given rail firms a free hand to negotiate. But according to the RMT, the rail workers\u2019 union, the \u201cdead hand\u201d of Grayling has halted progress.</p> <p>RMT and Aslef are used to fighting disputes in the public eye and the walkouts have been meticulously planned for maximum political effect. They will coincide with the Conservative party\u2019s annual conference in Manchester and follow proposed action by public sector unions including the PCS and the POA over the government\u2019s refusal to lift the pay cap.</p> <p>These disputes also underline how difficult it is to modernise industries when technological progress appears to pose a direct threat to jobs. Industrial action is planned at Southern Rail, Merseyrail, Arriva Rail North and Greater Anglia in a row over the introduction of driver-only operated trains. The abolition of conductors is deemed unacceptable by rail unions, who are well aware that driverless trains could be the next development.</p> <p>An RMT spokesman said that after Southern Rail, Merseyrail, Arriva Rail North and Greater Anglia failed to engage properly in talks, he suspected the involvement of the transport secretary: \u201cWe believe that the dead hand of Chris Grayling has been at work. This is not normal in terms of industrial relations. Our belief is that it is politically driven by the DfT.\u201d</p> <p>Economically driven might be more apt. The government is tired of pumping billions into Network Rail, the owner of Britain\u2019s tracks and stations, and wants costs to be held down across the industry. It doesn\u2019t take long for that sort of agenda to clash directly with unions.</p> <p>The RMT official added that Abellio, the Dutch government-owned company which has the Anglia franchise, last year reached an agreement with the RMT in Scotland in a similar dispute, but is not sitting down with the union now.</p> <p>\u201cHow come Abellio was able to strike a deal over Scotrail, but can\u2019t do it on Anglia? If it was great deal there, why not here? Is it because the government wants train operators to take a stand?\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, there are signs that the most divisive dispute \u2013 on Southern, Britain\u2019s busiest commuter franchise \u2013 is not intractable. The negotiations with Southern, involving both rail unions, took a new turn last Thursday when Aslef claimed it was close to a deal. Details of the talks were withheld, but a joint statement said \u201csignificant progress\u201d had been made in discussions between the union and Govia Thameslink.</p> <p>But this will probably come at a cost to intra-union relations. Tensions between Aslef and the RMT have increased over the past year. RMT officials are furious that Aslef negotiators have sought a preferential deal for their members behind the backs of fellow trade unionists. Aslef members have already rejected two offers recommended by the union \u2014 both of which offered concessions in exchange for drivers taking responsibility for closing train doors.</p> <p>This leaves RMT in the familiar position of being public enemy number one for the franchise owners. They claim that RMT is on a \u201cnational crusade\u201d to gain more money and power for its members. Operators argue that driver-only operation (DOO) was introduced on the Bedford-St Pancras line in 1982 and has spread to about 30% of the UK mainline network, as well as London Underground, and results in a more efficient system.</p> <p>The RMT insists that operating with a guard is superior to DOO on safety grounds. In a dossier prepared last June, the union asked: \u201cWith the [DOO] model being nothing new, it is right to ask why, if it is so safe, has it been adopted by less than a third of the network? The answer is that it is unsafe, and unpopular with the public.\u201d</p> <p>Southern said: \u201cWe are disappointed by this unnecessary action and the RMT\u2019s continued refusal to engage with us in modernising the railway. Last strike, we ran a normal service on most routes but passengers will inevitably be affected in places and we deeply regret any inconvenience these strikes will cause.\u201d</p> <p>The rail minister, Paul Maynard, accused the RMT of \u201cplaying political games\u201d over the Southern dispute. He said: \u201cOn Southern, performance has been significantly better this year but this can only improve if industrial action by the trade unions stops. This is not about safety, as the regulator has ruled that driver-controlled trains are safe. No one is losing their job or any pay as a result of the changes being put in place.\u201d</p> <p>The heyday for UK rail industry investment, which came after the Labour government created Network Rail from the ashes of Railtrack, is a distant era. As franchise owners and the government look for ways to save money, British commuters should be braced for more strikes.</p> <ul> <li><em>The headline of this story was amended on 23 September to \u201cdriver-only trains\u201d.</em> <br></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The Treasury has hit back at warnings by the credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s that the likelihood of a hard Brexit and a squeeze on the public finances would damage the UK economy\u2019s long-term health. Announcing its decision just hours after Theresa May gave her speech in Florence on the government\u2019s Brexit strategy, the ratings agency said it had cut the UK\u2019s credit rating to Aa2 from Aa1 partly in response to the looming prospect of the UK\u2019s access to the European Union\u2019s single market and customs union being reduced. Moody\u2019s, which was the first major credit ratings agency to strip Britain of its top-notch AAA rating in 2016, said plans to ease austerity measures and lift the public sector pay cap would put pressure on the public finances while slower growth over the next four to five years was likely to reduce tax receipts. Britain has cut its budget deficit from about 10% of economic output in 2010 to 2.3% in the 2016/17 financial year, but the annual deficit is expected to rise this year following a period of declining household incomes. \u201cMoody\u2019s expects the budget deficit to remain at 3% to 3.5% of GDP in coming years against the government\u2019s plan of a gradual reduction to below 1% in 2021/22,\u201d its note said. \u201cFiscal pressures will be exacerbated by the erosion of the UK\u2019s medium-term economic strength that is likely to result from the manner of its departure from the European Union, and by the increasingly apparent challenges to policy-making given the complexity of Brexit negotiations and associated domestic political dynamics,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. The Office for Budget Responsibility said in March that the Treasury would have about \u00a326bn of headroom in the public finances over the next five years, offering the prospect of tax cuts or spending increases in the autumn budget on 22 November. Recent figures for the public finances have shown them to be recovering with tax receipts outstripping higher spending. But Moody\u2019s said this was likely to prove shortlived: \u201cMoody\u2019s expects the budget deficit to remain at 3 to 3.5% of GDP in coming years against the government\u2019s plan of a gradual reduction to below 1% in 2021/22.\u201d The Treasury accused the ratings agency of being out of date following May\u2019s speech, which it said provided more clarity about the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. \u201cThe prime minister has just set out an ambitious vision for the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU, making clear that both sides will benefit from a new and unique partnership,\u201d the Treasury said. \u201cWe have made substantial progress in reducing the deficit while finding extra money for the NHS and social care at the same time. We are not complacent about the challenges ahead, but we are optimistic about our bright future,\u201d a Treasury spokesperson added. Moody\u2019s revised up its outlook on the country to stable from negative, meaning a further downgrade is not imminent. The shadow treasury chief secretary, Peter Dowd, said the downgrading was a \u201chammer blow\u201d to the government\u2019s economic credibility. \u201cFor the second time under the Tories the UK\u2019s credit rating has been downgraded, and on this occasion citing their lack of faith in the chancellor to meet his own spending targets as a result of unfunded spending commitments such as the deal with the DUP,\u201d he said. The Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, said it was no coincidence the downgrading followed May\u2019s address in Florence. \u201cDespite Theresa May\u2019s conciliatory tone we are no closer to knowing what our future relationship with the EU will be once any transitional deal expires,\u201d he said. \u201cThe warning that Moody\u2019s have issued by downgrading the credit rating is that the economy will be weaker once the transitional deal comes to an end. All May has done is simply delay the economic pain caused by an extreme Brexit.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Workers at the Ritzy cinema in Brixton, south London, will go on strike again on Saturday as a dispute over pay enters its second year. Members of the Bectu union will walk out for 24 hours. The row has since spread to several other Picturehouse cinemas in London and Brighton. The workers want higher wages, sick pay and the reinstatement of several union representatives who were sacked this year after industrial action. Sophie Lowe, one of the striking Ritzy workers, said: \u201cOne year on from the start of this dispute, we are planning a substantial escalation in the campaign.\u201d There will be nine strikes during the British Film Institute\u2019s London film festival next month. The action will include a demonstration at Leicester Square on 4 October \u2013 the first day of the festival \u2013 involving staff from the Crouch End, Hackney and East Dulwich Picturehouses, as well as Picturehouse Central and the Ritzy. During the festival, staff at the Hackney and Central cinemas will strike from 5pm on 6-8 October and from 11-15 October. The BFI said it supported the Picturehouse workers\u2019 call for payment of the London living wage, which it paid its own employees. \u201cThe BFI is disappointed that the London Film Festival has become associated with this industrial action. The current plan is that LFF screenings will go ahead as published at both Picturehouse Central and Hackney Picturehouse.\u201d The campaign has won the support of high-profile figures including actor Sir Ian McKellen and director Ken Loach. They are among 25 actors and screenwriters who have urged the public to boycott Picturehouse cinemas and their parent company, Cineworld. Loach, a Bectu member, said: \u201cPicturehouse is owned by Cineworld, which is a big multinational corporation. They make fortunes. The idea that they pay starvation wages because they can get people who are desperate for work is absolutely shocking. Victory to the Picturehouse striker, no doubt.\u201d The struggle of Picturehouse staff has also garnered political support with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and other Labour MPs writing a letter in the Guardian expressing concern over treatment of trade unionists. \u201cAny suspensions or sackings intended to intimidate trade union members would be a matter of deep concern for the whole labour movement. No trade unionist or Labour party member can tolerate the deliberate intimidation of trade union activists for pursuing their legitimate business,\u201d they wrote. Picturehouse has created the Picturehouse Staff Forum, described as a \u201cfake union\u201d by Bectu members. They claim it has been set up by Picturehouse specifically to block Bectu from being able to negotiate on behalf of its members at other cinemas. A Picturehouse statement said: \u201cPaying our staff a fair wage is hugely important to us. Staff at the Ritzy are paid \u00a39.10 [an hour] \u2013 equivalent to \u00a39.70 when working an eight-hour shift as we choose to pay for breaks. \u201cWe also offer statutory sick pay, maternity/paternity pay and 28 days\u2019 paid holiday among other competitive benefits. This makes Picturehouse Cinemas one of the highest-paying employers in the cinema industry.\u201d The London living wage is \u00a39.75 an hour \u2013 65p more than what Picturehouse staff are paid. This is calculated by the Living Wage Foundation and has led other cinema chains such as Curzon to agree to pay their staff this rate in 2014 amid a similar dispute. Cineworld reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a398.2m for 2016 \u2013 slightly lower than the previous 12 months. Naomi Taylor, a Bectu official, told the Guardian: \u201cCineworld owns Picturehouse and Cineworld\u2019s chief executive earned \u00a32.5m just last year. Picturehouse can afford to pay their staff a living wage \u2013 they just choose not to.\u201d About 70% of Cineworld\u2019s UK front-of-house staff, including 700 at Picturehouse are on zero-hours contracts without benefits such as parental leave or sick pay.",

Victory to the Picturehouse striker, no doubt.\u201d<br></p> <p>The struggle of Picturehouse staff has also garnered political support with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and other Labour MPs writing a letter in the Guardian expressing concern over treatment of trade unionists.<br></p> <p>\u201cAny suspensions or sackings intended to intimidate trade union members would be a matter of deep concern for the whole labour movement. No trade unionist or Labour party member can tolerate the deliberate intimidation of trade union activists for pursuing their legitimate business,\u201d they wrote.<br></p> <p>Picturehouse has created the Picturehouse Staff Forum, described as a \u201cfake union\u201d by Bectu members. They claim it has been set up by Picturehouse specifically to block Bectu from being able to negotiate on behalf of its members at other cinemas.<br></p> <p>A Picturehouse statement said: \u201cPaying our staff a fair wage is hugely important to us. Staff at the Ritzy are paid \u00a39.10 [an hour] \u2013 equivalent to \u00a39.70 when working an eight-hour shift as we choose to pay for breaks.</p> <p>\u201cWe also offer statutory sick pay, maternity/paternity pay and 28 days\u2019 paid holiday among other competitive benefits. This makes Picturehouse Cinemas one of the highest-paying employers in the cinema industry.\u201d</p> <p>The London living wage is \u00a39.75 an hour \u2013 65p more than what Picturehouse staff are paid. This is calculated by the <a href=\"https://www.livingwage.org.uk/\">Living Wage Foundation</a> and has led other cinema chains such as Curzon to agree to pay their staff this rate in 2014 amid a similar dispute.<br></p> <p>Cineworld reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a398.2m for 2016 \u2013 slightly lower than the previous 12 months.<br></p> <p>Naomi Taylor, a Bectu official, told the Guardian: \u201cCineworld owns Picturehouse and Cineworld\u2019s chief executive earned \u00a32.5m just last year. Picturehouse can afford to pay their staff a living wage \u2013 they just choose not to.\u201d<br></p> <p>About 70% of Cineworld\u2019s UK front-of-house staff, including 700 at Picturehouse are on zero-hours contracts without benefits such as parental leave or sick pay.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A Chinese group that was stopped by Donald Trump from buying a US chip-maker last week has announced a \u00a3550m takeover of British chip designer Imagination Technologies. Canyon Bridge Capital Partners\u2019 all-cash offer for Imagination showed the buyout fund remained focused on investing in western chip-makers after its $1.3bn (\u00a3960m) deal to buy Lattice Semiconductor was blocked over US national security concerns. Canyon Bridge said it would pay 182p a share for Imagination \u2013 a 42% premium on its closing price on Friday. However, the deal depends on Imagination selling US chip designer Mips, which it bought in 2013. The two companies said the takeover would not result in job cuts. Selling Mips will avoid subjecting Canyon Bridge\u2019s takeover of Imagination to a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2013 the government panel that blocked its Lattice deal. Imagination said it would sell Mips for $65m to Tallwood Venture Capital, an investment firm with offices in Palo Alto, California, and Wuxi, southern China. Canyon Bridge was founded with capital from the Chinese government and has indirect links to Beijing\u2019s space programme. It manages about $1.5bn on behalf of Yitai Capital Ltd, a Chinese state-owned company. Imagination, whose chips have been used in devices including Apple\u2019s iPhone, licenses graphics and video-processing technology to semiconductor companies. Shares in Imagination crashed 70% in April when Apple, its biggest customer, said it would stop using its graphics technology in its new products. The two companies remain in a legal dispute over royalties. Lattice makes chips known as \u201cfield-programmable gate arrays\u201d, which let companies put their own software on chips for different uses. It does not sell chips to the US military, but its two biggest rivals \u2013 Xilinx and Intel\u2019s Altera \u2013 make chips that are used in military technology. Following Trump\u2019s decision to bar Canyon Bridge from buying Lattice, Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, said the move reflected concerns about the transfer of intellectual property, Beijing\u2019s role in the deal, the importance of semiconductor supply chain integrity to the US government, and the government\u2019s use of Lattice products. Canyon Bridge\u2019s investment focus complements China\u2019s efforts to move its manufacturers up the value chain and create innovative and competitive global conglomerates. In the past two years, the Chinese government has set aside at least 350bn yuan (\u00a339bn) to invest in new technologies.",
