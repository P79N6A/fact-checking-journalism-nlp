    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\"Thank you for calling Moody's,\" says the automated voice. \"Your call may be recorded for quality purposes. If you would like a rating, press one.\" I press one. There is a brief musical interlude. \"Hello, Moody's,\" says another voice, eventually. \"What rating would you like?\" As you may have deduced, I am on the phone to Moody's Investors Service. Along with Fitch, and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), Moody's are one of the Big Three credit ratings agencies. They sound like a trio of preppy clothing companies, but in fact they are some of the most powerful players in world finance. Specifically, they rate the \"creditworthiness\" of companies and currencies. In the process, it is hoped that they give investors an idea which investments are safest to make. \"Hello, Moody's!\" I say. \"I would like to know the rating for UK sovereign debt.\" It's a topical question. The eurozone crisis has seen countries' ratings fall across the continent. Chancellor George Osborne has staked his reputation on helping the UK avoid the same fate. My adviser will ideally come back to me with three particular letters: AAA. This is the highest rating Moody's offers. Then comes AA1, and the scale goes down to C. Anything below BBB is known as \"junk\". \"The UK has a rating of AAA,\" says Ms Moody. But then comes the hammer-blow: \"We also have a negative outlook for the UK.\" This negative outlook \u2013 which Moody's announced on Monday \u2013 isn't quite AA1, but it's the preamble to it. The lower their outlook, the more likely Moody's thinks the UK government is to default on its debts \u2013 and the less likely it is that people such as me will want to lend it money. The lenders that do remain will be more nervous about the prospects of getting their money back \u2013 and so they'll charge higher interest rates. And the higher the interest rates, the steeper the government's debt repayments, and the more likely it is to default. And so it goes on. It is an Escherian cycle, and one in which the credit ratings agencies \u2013 many argue \u2013 play too powerful a role. \"I am no fan of conspiracy theories,\" said Rainer Bruederle, a former German economic minister, after S&amp;P threatened to downgrade 15 EU countries in December, \"but sometimes it is hard to dismiss the impression that some American ratings agencies and fund managers are working against the eurozone.\" But Europeans aren't the only ones up in arms. \"S&amp;P has shown really terrible judgment and they've handled themselves very poorly,\" said US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner after S&amp;P downgraded America's AAA credit rating in August. \"They've shown a stunning lack of knowledge about basic US fiscal maths.\" The agencies say they're simply telling it like it is. After all, the US congress spent most of last summer dithering about how to rescue the American economy. All winter, European leaders have flip-flopped about how to save the euro. Both quagmires, S&amp;P argues, logically make it likelier that the governments concerned will renege on their debts. More people would trust the agencies if they hadn't got so much so wrong so recently. In 2009 Moody's issued a report titled \"Investor fears over Greek government liquidity misplaced\"; within six months, the country was seeking a bailout. Meanwhile, S&amp;P's sovereign debt team miscalculated US debt by as much as $2tn when it downgraded America's credit rating last August. Small wonder the Independent called the team's then head \u2013 the mustachioed, chain-smoking David Beers \u2013 \"the most powerful man in the world that you've never heard of\". As for their recent decisions, few believe that the agencies are wrong \u2013 but some think they're wrong for speaking up. By highlighting the seriousness of the situation, finance ministers argue the agencies are making things worse, because of the cooling effect their downgrades have on investment. \"The rating agencies fuelled the crisis in 2008,\" raged Christian Noyer, the governor of the Bank of France, in December, \"and we can question whether they are not doing the same thing in the current crisis.\" Noyer's view highlights the paradoxical position ratings agencies find themselves in. Today, they are said to be too quick to downgrade government bonds. Five years ago, by contrast, they were too slow to downgrade the toxic debt that caused the financial crisis. \"During the sub-prime mortgage crisis,\" says Larry Elliott, the Guardian's economics editor, \"the ratings agencies were very, very lax.\" In layman's terms, the 2008 crisis started when thousands of US homeowners stopped paying interest on their mortgage. The crisis spread because thousands of bankers and fund-managers had foolishly backed those mortgages, and so lost a lot of money themselves. They did this partly through their own lack of foresight, but also because of the ratings agencies' failure to warn them of the risks involved. In the run-up to 2008, a staggering proportion of mortgage-based debts were rated AAA, when in fact they were junk. The same goes for groups such as Enron, Lehman Brothers and AIG. Days before they went bust, Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch all still rated these failing companies as safe investments. Shockingly, more than half of all corporate debt ever rated AAA by S&amp;P has been downgraded within seven years, according to research by economist Sukhdev Johal. Part of the problem is that ratings agencies are funded by the very companies they rate. If you want to be rated, you must pay an agency between $1,500 and $2,500,000 for the privilege, depending on the size of your company. In theory, this creates a conflict of interest, because it gives the agency an incentive to give the companies the rating they want. It could explain why, for much of the past decade, agencies seemed happy not to question either the risks banks were taking, or the accuracy of their accounts. \"We rely on audited statements,\" one senior analyst told Alexandra Ouroussoff, an anthropologist who spent six years interviewing people involved with credit ratings agencies. \"We are hamstrung by audited statements. If lying accountants sign off on a fiction ...\" The analyst \u2013 known as Jane \u2013 left the sentence unfinished, but her inference was clear: the agencies are only as effective as their clients are honest. There is a flipside. On the one hand, it is claimed the agencies do not deal robustly enough with the companies who pay them. On the other, it is said they are too aggressive with the companies who don't. In 1998, Moody's wrote to a German insurance giant called Hannover Re, according to research by the Washington Post's Alec Klein. Though Hannover was not a client of Moody's, the agency said that it had nevertheless decided to rate them free of charge. Ominously, the agency hoped that in the future Hannover would be interested in paying for the service itself. \"We need to act,\" said Hannover's chairman, Wilhelm Zeller. Unfortunately, Hannover did not act soon enough. Moody's began rating Hannover's debt status, but the insurance company had already enlisted the services of S&amp;P and AM Best (another, smaller agency). In 2003, Moody's downgraded its debt to junk status, and because of the respect paid to Moody's valuations, shareholders panicked, sold their stock, and Hannover Re lost $175m (\u00a3111m) in an afternoon. Moody's declined to comment for the Washington Post piece. It's an example that highlights the power of the Big Three, who collectively rate around 95% of debt. \"They have built up such a franchise,\" Zeller told the newspaper, \"it's difficult, if not impossible, to do anything against it.\" There are more than 150 ratings agencies worldwide, but in order to have any credibility, companies really need at least one of Moody's, S&amp;P and Fitch on their side, and preferably all three. The first two firms each control around 40% of the market. Fitch has about 15%, and is usually engaged when S&amp;P and Moody's disagree significantly about the creditworthiness of a debt. This generally happens because S&amp;P measures how likely a debtor is to default, whereas Moody's rates how long the default is likely to last. It wasn't always like this. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were no ratings agencies, and very few ways of telling which of the many emerging securities were worth investing in. There was a gap in the market, and the first person to fill it was a Wall St errand boy called John Moody. In 1900, aged 32, he published Moody's Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities, a compendium of information on thousands of financial institutions. The book sold out in months, and an industry was born. Poor's Publishing Company (the predecessor to S&amp;P) emerged in 1916, Fitch in 1924. Until the 1980s, the Big Three were still primarily North America-based, and demand for their services was not high. This was because they rated the debt markets, whereas at that time companies still did half their borrowing from banks, and invested in things in which they had personal knowledge. \"In the old days, few bothered to engage a credit ratings agency because they dealt with what they knew,\" writes Ha-Joon Chang, a heterodox (or leftwing) economist and author of 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism. \"Banks lent to companies that they knew or to local households, whose behaviours they could easily understand, even if they did not know them individually. Most people bought financial products from companies and governments of their own countries in their own currencies.\" But from the 80s onwards, as the financial system became more deregulated, companies started borrowing more and more from the globalised debt markets, and so the opinion of the credit ratings agencies became more and more relevant. All three agencies are still headquartered in America, but they now have offices in hundreds of countries, thanks to the rapid expansionist tactics Hannover Re experienced at first hand. For countries such as Britain, the USA and France, the threat of a downgrade is not as serious as it has been for other European countries. Moody's negative outlook did not hit the pound or government bond prices hard, and the FTSE 100 was affected only slightly. Even if Britain's rating fell to AA1, the state is unlikely to be seriously affected because most other countries are in the same boat, and investors have to put their money somewhere. \"In this respect, AAB is like the new triple-A,\" says Heather Stewart, economics editor for the Observer. But in many other areas of the financial system, the agencies still wield tremendous power \u2013 power that many believe needs more regulation. \"The obvious solution would be to take this public service into public hands,\" Aditya Chakrabortty has argued in these pages. \"Let's have a ratings agency run by the UN, funded by pooled contributions from both lenders and borrowers ... Let's make the ratings business a utility, rather than a semi-cartel that intimidates elected politicians and rakes in excess profits. It's time to break up the bullying double-act.\" Others are more pessimistic about the effect regulation could realistically have. \"Whether [or not] an intentional masking of risk by analysts was a significant factor in precipitating the banking crisis ... the focus on irresponsibility serves to deflect attention from the more important question: the question of the accuracy of the risk-modelling techniques,\" writes Ouroussoff, who is also the author of Wall Street at War. In other words, the problem posed by credit ratings agencies lies not so much in their alleged malpractice or negligence, but in the sheer impossibility of rating creditworthiness in the first place. It's a problem that derives from the difference between quantifying risk and predicting uncertainty. Credit ratings agencies aren't bad at doing the former; at calculating, through mathematical formulas, the statistical likelihood of, say, more than 5% of homeowners defaulting on their mortgage. But they're arguably bad at doing the latter; at predicting the unpredictable, or anything that can't be included within a statistic: the possibility, for example, that vast swaths of the banking industry might, through sheer stupidity, have handed out mortgages to people who couldn't possibly pay them back. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 February 2012.

It could explain why, for much of the past decade, agencies seemed happy not to question either the risks banks were taking, or the accuracy of their accounts. \"We rely on audited statements,\" one senior analyst told Alexandra Ouroussoff, an anthropologist who <a href=\"http://politybooks.com/book.asp?ref=9780745644172\" title=\"\">spent six years interviewing people involved with credit ratings agencies</a>. \"We are hamstrung by audited statements. If lying accountants sign off on a fiction ...\" The analyst \u2013 known as Jane \u2013 left the sentence unfinished, but her inference was clear: the agencies are only as effective as their clients are honest.</p> <p>There is a flipside. On the one hand, it is claimed the agencies do not deal robustly enough with the companies who pay them. On the other, it is said they are too aggressive with the companies who don't. In 1998, Moody's wrote to a German insurance giant called Hannover Re, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8032-2004Nov23.html\" title=\"\">according to research by the Washington Post's Alec Klein</a>. Though Hannover was not a client of Moody's, the agency said that it had nevertheless decided to rate them free of charge. Ominously, the agency hoped that in the future Hannover would be interested in paying for the service itself. \"We need to act,\" said Hannover's chairman, Wilhelm Zeller.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Hannover did not act soon enough. Moody's began rating Hannover's debt status, but the insurance company had already enlisted the services of S&amp;P and AM Best (another, smaller agency). In 2003, Moody's downgraded its debt to junk status, and because of the respect paid to Moody's valuations, shareholders panicked, sold their stock, and Hannover Re lost $175m (\u00a3111m) in an&#xa0;afternoon. Moody's declined to comment for the Washington Post piece.</p> <p>It's an example that highlights the power of the Big Three, who collectively rate around 95% of debt. \"They have built up such a franchise,\" Zeller told the newspaper, \"it's&#xa0;difficult, if not impossible, to do anything against it.\" There are more than 150 ratings agencies worldwide, but in order to have any credibility, companies really need at least one of Moody's, S&amp;P and Fitch on their side, and preferably all three. The first two firms each control around 40% of the market. Fitch has about 15%, and is usually engaged when S&amp;P and Moody's disagree significantly about the creditworthiness of a debt. This generally happens because S&amp;P measures how likely a debtor is to default, whereas Moody's rates how long the default is likely to last.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386067781\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/2/15/1329331933666/A-former-Lehman-Brothers--007.jpg\" alt=\"A former Lehman Brothers employee\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A former Lehman Brothers employee leaves the office after the bank filed for bankruptcy in\u00a02008. Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn't always like this. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were no ratings agencies, and very few ways of telling which of the many emerging securities were worth investing in. There was a gap in the market, and the first person to fill it was <a href=\"http://www.moodys.com/Pages/atc001.aspx\" title=\"\">a Wall St errand boy called John Moody</a>. In 1900, aged 32, he published Moody's Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities, a compendium of information on thousands of financial institutions. The book sold out in months, and an industry was born. Poor's Publishing Company (the predecessor to S&amp;P) emerged in 1916, Fitch in 1924.</p> <p>Until the 1980s, the Big Three were still primarily North America-based, and demand for their services was not high. This was because they rated the debt markets, whereas at that time companies still did half their borrowing from banks, and invested in things in which they had personal knowledge. \"In the old days, few bothered to engage a credit ratings agency because they dealt with what they knew,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jan/15/dont-blame-ratings-euro-turmoil?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">writes Ha-Joon Chang</a>, a heterodox (or leftwing) economist and author of 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism. \"Banks lent to companies that they knew or to local households, whose behaviours they could easily understand, even if they did not know them individually. Most people bought financial products from companies and governments of their own countries in their own currencies.\" But from the 80s onwards, as the financial system became more deregulated, companies started borrowing more and more from the globalised debt markets, and so the opinion of the credit ratings agencies became more and more relevant. All three agencies are still headquartered in America, but they now have offices in hundreds of countries, thanks to the rapid expansionist tactics Hannover Re experienced at first hand.</p> <p>For countries such as Britain, the USA and France, the threat of a downgrade is not as serious as it has been for other European countries. Moody's negative outlook did not hit the pound or government bond prices hard, and the FTSE 100 was affected only slightly. Even if Britain's rating fell to AA1, the state is unlikely to be seriously affected because most other countries are in the same boat, and investors have to put their money somewhere. \"In this&#xa0;respect, AAB is like the new triple-A,\" says Heather Stewart, economics editor for&#xa0;the&#xa0;Observer.</p> <p>But in many other areas of the financial system, the agencies still wield tremendous power \u2013 power that many believe needs more regulation. \"The obvious solution would be to take this public service into public hands,\" Aditya Chakrabortty has argued <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jan/16/time-control-credit-ratings-agencies\" title=\"\">in these pages</a>. \"Let's have a ratings agency run by the UN, funded by pooled contributions from both lenders and borrowers ... Let's make the ratings business a utility, rather than a semi-cartel that intimidates elected politicians and rakes in excess profits. It's time to break up the bullying double-act.\"</p> <p>Others are more pessimistic about the effect regulation could realistically have. \"Whether [or not] an intentional masking of risk by analysts was a significant factor in precipitating the banking crisis ... the focus on irresponsibility serves to deflect attention from the more important question: the question of the accuracy of the risk-modelling techniques,\" writes Ouroussoff, who is also the author of <a href=\"http://politybooks.com/book.asp?ref=9780745644172\" title=\"\">Wall Street at War</a>. In other words, the problem posed by credit ratings agencies lies not so much in their alleged malpractice or negligence, but in the sheer impossibility of rating creditworthiness in the first place. It's a problem that derives from the difference between quantifying risk and predicting uncertainty. Credit ratings agencies aren't bad at doing the former; at calculating, through mathematical formulas, the statistical likelihood of, say, more than 5% of homeowners defaulting on their mortgage. But they're arguably bad at doing the latter; at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\" title=\"\">predicting the unpredictable</a>, or anything that can't be included within a statistic: the possibility, for example, that vast swaths of the banking industry might, through sheer stupidity, have handed out mortgages to people who couldn't possibly pay them back.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 February 2012.

It is of the day Greece defaults on its debts, and the Aegean Sea is awash with small boats in which fleeing Greeks huddle with suitcases full of euros. Guards patrol the border in an attempt to prevent the flight of capital. Things get ugly and there are shootings, captured on film. Despite the best efforts of policymakers in Athens, Brussels and Frankfurt, it proves impossible to contain the panic, which spreads to Portugal and Ireland, the other two countries going through tough austerity programmes in return for bailouts from the EU and the IMF. Across Europe, governments are engaged in contingency planning for this sort of scenario. In the UK \u2013 which had first-hand experience of how crises can escalate when there was a three-day run on Northern Rock in 2007 \u2013 the Bank of England, the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority have been \"war-gaming\" what might be expected in the event of Greece repudiating its debts and leaving the single currency. Most big businesses across the UK have also made preparations for a euro meltdown, fearful not just of the direct impact on sales but of a drying up of credit and trade finance. Few doubt that a messy Greek default would lead to a credit crunch at least equal in severity to that which followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, said it was impossible for any government to be fully prepared, but said the UK authorities were braced for a range of outcomes. Threadneedle Street is convinced that failure to end Europe's long-running debt crisis would have severe implications for the UK economy. King said there would be a substantial fall in spending, exports would collapse and hopes of rebalancing the economy would be dashed. Policymakers have stepped up the pace of their planning in recent days following the marked deterioration in the relationship between Greece and its single-currency partners. Athens believes that the rest of the eurozone wants Greece out, while Germany is leading the group of hardline countries demanding assurances before the \u20ac130bn bailout is agreed. While Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, says \"we're better prepared than two years ago\", others believe the ramifications of a Greek exit would be felt globally. \"The consequences would be devastating for Greek citizens and particularly for the most vulnerable,\" predicted Amadeu Altafaj, spokesman for Europe's commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, Olli Rehn. \"Consequences would be felt throughout the eurozone and beyond.\" European policymakers are looking beyond contingency planning for a Greek default to the possibility of the country crashing out of the euro. Greece would probably have to impose capital controls \u2013 limits on the amount of money that can be taken in and out of the country \u2013 while it implemented \"drachmatisation\". All balances at Greek banks would probably be redenominated at a fixed exchange rate with the new (or rather the old) currency; but banks could be shut, or strict limits placed on withdrawals from cash machines, while the details were worked out. These capital controls, and the difficulty of getting hold of cash inside Greece, would have knock-on effects for any businesses, holidaymakers or ex-pats in the country at the time. In the UK, Whitehall insiders said the various government departments that would have to be involved have been discussing how to minimise the impact for months. The Foreign Office would have to think about how to bring home Britons trapped in Greece without enough funds to get out; Vince Cable's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills would have to offer advice, and possibly funding, to businesses with exposure to the country; and the Treasury would also have a key role. The other direct impact would be on the financial sector \u2013 for any banks still holding Greek bonds, for example. In the UK, the much-derided \"tripartite committee\" \u2013 the Bank of England, the Treasury, and City regulator the Financial Services Authority \u2013 would still be the locus for decision-making. As part of the government's new arrangements for coping with financial crises, the new Financial Policy Committee, chaired by King, would also meet to decide what action was necessary. In the worst-case scenario, Greece could be followed by more countries as the markets speculated on whether Portugal, Ireland or Spain would be the next to default. If the bonds of all these countries were called into question, Britain's banks could be hit hard, and the Treasury could even be forced to contemplate fresh taxpayer-backed nationalisations. It is to forestall a Greek domino effect that the European Central Bank has flooded Europe's banks with cheap money over the past two months, easing funding concerns and bringing down interest rates on Spanish and Italian bonds. Brussels believes the replacement of Silvio Berlusconi as Italian prime minister by Mario Monti has helped to create a firewall between Greece and its southern European neighbours. The containment strategy has worked up until now, but may be about to face its biggest test.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Mervyn King left the door open on Wednesday to further doses of electronic money creation as the latest Bank of England snapshot of the economy said the UK would crawl its way through 2012.</p> <p>Announcing the findings of Threadneedle Street's quarterly inflation report, the Bank's governor said it would not be until 2013 that the UK returned to its pre-crisis level of output and warned that there would be a \"zigzag\" pattern to growth for the rest of this year.</p> <p>The Bank predicted a strong pick-up in output in 2013 and a slightly higher level of inflation than anticipated three months ago, but King warned that the economy was going through challenging times, in which \"substantial headwinds\" were hindering the recovery.</p> <p>In the City, analysts were left divided by the report, with some expecting further asset purchases when the current \u00a350bn quantitative easing (QE) programme ends in May and others convinced that the Bank would call a halt to at \u00a3325bn.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citigroup, said the Bank's forecasts for growth were over-optimistic and he expected the Bank to extend QE to \u00a3400bn during the course of 2012.</p> <p>However Sam Hill, analyst at RBC, said: \"If there is significant downside news over the next three months then the monetary policy committee could announce further asset purchases; but if developments evolve in line with these latest projections then [we think] the default assumption should be in favour of the MPC taking no further action this year once the \u00a3325bn target has been achieved. Overall, therefore, we remain comfortable with our forecast for an end to asset purchases in May.\"</p> <p>The inflation report showed the economy slowing to a virtual standstill in the first half of 2012, but recovering later in the year as a result of the boost to real incomes provided by falling inflation.

      "bodyText": "Sir Mervyn King left the door open on Wednesday to further doses of electronic money creation as the latest Bank of England snapshot of the economy said the UK would crawl its way through 2012. Announcing the findings of Threadneedle Street's quarterly inflation report, the Bank's governor said it would not be until 2013 that the UK returned to its pre-crisis level of output and warned that there would be a \"zigzag\" pattern to growth for the rest of this year. The Bank predicted a strong pick-up in output in 2013 and a slightly higher level of inflation than anticipated three months ago, but King warned that the economy was going through challenging times, in which \"substantial headwinds\" were hindering the recovery. In the City, analysts were left divided by the report, with some expecting further asset purchases when the current \u00a350bn quantitative easing (QE) programme ends in May and others convinced that the Bank would call a halt to at \u00a3325bn. Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citigroup, said the Bank's forecasts for growth were over-optimistic and he expected the Bank to extend QE to \u00a3400bn during the course of 2012. However Sam Hill, analyst at RBC, said: \"If there is significant downside news over the next three months then the monetary policy committee could announce further asset purchases; but if developments evolve in line with these latest projections then [we think] the default assumption should be in favour of the MPC taking no further action this year once the \u00a3325bn target has been achieved. Overall, therefore, we remain comfortable with our forecast for an end to asset purchases in May.\" The inflation report showed the economy slowing to a virtual standstill in the first half of 2012, but recovering later in the year as a result of the boost to real incomes provided by falling inflation. King, however, stressed the need to be patient. \"Although some recent business surveys suggest a brighter picture for activity at the beginning of this year, the fiscal consolidation and tight credit conditions at home, and the weakness of our major overseas trading partners, are acting as a drag on growth. The underlying need for repair of balance sheets means that the path of recovery is likely to be slow and uncertain. \"For much of this year, there is likely to be a \"zigzag\" pattern of alternating positive and negative quarterly growth rates reflecting the additional bank holiday for the Queen's diamond jubilee, so that it will be harder than usual to interpret the official estimates of growth.\" The governor said QE was working, despite claims that the money created by the purchase of gilts was not finding its way from commercial banks into the economy.

      "body": "<p>The old alliance of Europe and America faces a huge row with the rest of the world over the identity of the next head of the World Bank, after president Robert Zoellick said on Wednesday he is to leave his post in June.</p> <p>While his departure had been widely expected, the news kicks off the process of finding a new leader, who has traditionally been an American under an informal agreement dating to the founding of the bank 68 years ago. Speculation has focused on either US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton - who is also rumoured to have an eye on a run for the White House - or former Treasury secretary Larry Summers as Zoellick's likely successor. When Dominique Strauss-Kahn was succeeded by his countrywoman Christine Lagarde at the International Monetary Fund last year, it was widely rumoured that America had agreed to let Europe keep its traditional grip on the IMF \u2013 in the face of calls for a candidate from an emerging country \u2013 as long as France and other European governments backed Clinton as the new boss of the World Bank when the job came up.</p> <p>However, calls to widen the search to include candidates from outside the US began immediately. Campaigners including Oxfam, Eurodad and the African Forum and Network on Debt and Development (Afrodad), issued a joint statement appealing to America not to continue its monopoly of the role.</p> <p>Elizabeth Stuart of Oxfam said: \"The way the World Bank picks its president needs to change. The bank only operates in developing countries, so any candidate not supported by a majority of these countries would plainly lack legitimacy.\"</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/applications/blogs/pressoffice/2012/02/15/appointment-of-next-world-bank-head-%E2%80%93-campaigners-demand-fair-selection-process/\" title=\"\">an open letter to governors of the World Bank</a>, which provides loans to developing countries for capital programmes, the campaigners demanded that: the new president is selected by a majority of World Bank member countries; that the selection process is open to anyone to apply; and that a clear job description and required qualifications is set out, including \"a strong understanding and experience of the particular problems facing developing countries\".</p> <p>The search for Zoellick's successor now begins under guidelines adopted in 2011 that call for an \"open, merit-based and transparent selection\" process.</p> <p>While that may suggest a break from the informal agreement that the bank's president is always American, World Bank observers say that the rule has merely motivated the US to put forward strong candidates, who it can be convincingly argued might be the best person for the job.</p> <p>Clinton's name has continued to circulate as one of those, despite apparently ruling herself out of the job when asked last year. She has repeatedly said she has no plans to stay on as secretary of state past the end of President Obama's first term.</p> <p>Zoellick agreed that it was important that the process to select his successor was fair.

      "bodyText": "The old alliance of Europe and America faces a huge row with the rest of the world over the identity of the next head of the World Bank, after president Robert Zoellick said on Wednesday he is to leave his post in June. While his departure had been widely expected, the news kicks off the process of finding a new leader, who has traditionally been an American under an informal agreement dating to the founding of the bank 68 years ago. Speculation has focused on either US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton - who is also rumoured to have an eye on a run for the White House - or former Treasury secretary Larry Summers as Zoellick's likely successor. When Dominique Strauss-Kahn was succeeded by his countrywoman Christine Lagarde at the International Monetary Fund last year, it was widely rumoured that America had agreed to let Europe keep its traditional grip on the IMF \u2013 in the face of calls for a candidate from an emerging country \u2013 as long as France and other European governments backed Clinton as the new boss of the World Bank when the job came up. However, calls to widen the search to include candidates from outside the US began immediately. Campaigners including Oxfam, Eurodad and the African Forum and Network on Debt and Development (Afrodad), issued a joint statement appealing to America not to continue its monopoly of the role. Elizabeth Stuart of Oxfam said: \"The way the World Bank picks its president needs to change. The bank only operates in developing countries, so any candidate not supported by a majority of these countries would plainly lack legitimacy.\" In an open letter to governors of the World Bank, which provides loans to developing countries for capital programmes, the campaigners demanded that: the new president is selected by a majority of World Bank member countries; that the selection process is open to anyone to apply; and that a clear job description and required qualifications is set out, including \"a strong understanding and experience of the particular problems facing developing countries\". The search for Zoellick's successor now begins under guidelines adopted in 2011 that call for an \"open, merit-based and transparent selection\" process. While that may suggest a break from the informal agreement that the bank's president is always American, World Bank observers say that the rule has merely motivated the US to put forward strong candidates, who it can be convincingly argued might be the best person for the job. Clinton's name has continued to circulate as one of those, despite apparently ruling herself out of the job when asked last year. She has repeatedly said she has no plans to stay on as secretary of state past the end of President Obama's first term. Zoellick agreed that it was important that the process to select his successor was fair. But asked by Reuters whether the US government would agree to open up the selection process he replied \"you'll have to ask them\". He added that rumours he might now work for the Republican Party were \"not true\". The World Bank said that under Zoellick, who will have served one full five-year term, it had \"played an historic role during the global economic crisis, using record replenishments to provide more than $247bn to help developing countries boost growth and overcome poverty.\"",

      "bodyText": "The eurozone economy contracted in late 2011 for the first time since the depth of the global recession as the struggle to save the single currency took its toll on growth across the 17-nation region. With even Europe's powerhouse of Germany suffering a decline in output, figures from Brussels showed that gross domestic product in the euro area declined by 0.3% in the final three months of last year. The fall was slightly smaller than the financial markets had been expecting but analysts warned that there was still a strong risk of a further drop in activity in the first quarter of 2012 \u2013 thereby fulfilling the technical definition of a recession. With the United States, China and Britain all concerned about the impact of a deepening euro crisis on their economies, Europe will be top of the agenda when finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 group of developed and emerging nations meet in Mexico City later this month. The International Monetary Fund believes that even on the assumption that the single currency holds together, the eurozone will contract by 0.5% in 2012 before returning to modest growth in 2013. Consumer confidence collapsed in the eurozone in the second half of 2011 amid fears that contagion effects from Greece would threaten the future of the single currency.

Vicky Redwood, an analyst at Capital Economics, warned that the gloomy outlook for Europe would weigh heavily on the British economy during 2012 and make it more difficult for the coalition government to rebalance the economy towards exports. Almost 50% of the UK's trade goes to the eurozone and Redwood predicted that the looming recession for the single-currency nations would result in a drop of 5-10% in British exports to the EU in 2012 and a 10% decline in 2013. A breakdown of the data released by Eurostat showed that German output shrank by 0.2% in the final quarter of 2011, a slightly better outcome than the markets had expected, while Nicolas Sarkozy's presidential re-election prospects received a boost when France \u2013 the eurozone's second biggest economy - posted an unexpected 0.2% rise in GDP.

Rows of luxury apartment blocks have sprung up along the Thames not far away, offering coveted river views. So the obvious (and most lucrative) thing to do would be to build luxury flats on the 15 hectare (38 acre) site. The problem is the power station itself: it blocks the river views on most of the site. It is no surprise there is growing talk of demolition. The power station It goes on sale again next month, with an expected price tag of \u00a3300m to \u00a3400m, after the latest scheme, by Irish developer Treasury Holdings, collapsed. Chelsea Football Club is known to be interested in the sale but it is difficult to see how the club could pull it off \u2013 a new stadium next to the power station? According to calculations by property consultancy EC Harris, the site would be worth almost \u00a3500m more if the protected landmark building, with its distinct four white chimneys, could simply be torn down. EC Harris calculates that after demolition, and based on current density plans for housing, a developer could build 1,200 apartments where the building stands and sell them for an extra \u00a3470m. Flattening Europe's largest brick structure and its four chimneys would save estimated renovation costs of about \u00a3500m, roughly equivalent to the cost of demolition and apartment construction combined. Demolition could only take place if the building's listed status is removed. But Keith Garner of the Battersea Power Station Community Group, which wants to save the building, asks: \"How is it that so many other large industrial buildings of historic interest have been given new leases of life over the last 20 years or so \u2013 in the same time frame that three private owners have failed at Battersea?\" He pointed to Tate Modern, Dean Clough Mills in Halifax and a former Fiat factory in Turin. Architect Terry Farrell and Partners has drawn up a compromise proposal that would see the building left largely untouched and surrounded by a park. This scheme would avoid the need for extensive restoration and only cost between \u00a325m and \u00a350m. \"Given it's been derelict for so long it's time for reality. We are given to understand such a proposal would have the backing of English Heritage and the Wandsworth planners,\" Neil Bennett, a partner at the firm, told Reuters. The power station, whose chimneys have been a part of London's skyline for nearly 80 years and graced Pink Floyd's 1977 Animals album cover, is still an imposing building and far from being beyond repair, playing host to numerous art, theatre and other events.

The governor was at his lugubrious best on Wednesday as he outlined the contents of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report. These were, he insisted, challenging times. There were \"substantial headwinds\". Britain was on the mend, but it would take time to return to a world of steady growth, inflation close to its 2% target and a level of interest rates that did not pauperise pensioners. The actual contents of the inflation report were more upbeat. While predicting that 2012 will be another year of sluggish activity, the Bank thinks the pace of growth will pick up to around 3% by the start of 2013 and accelerate to between 3-4% in two years time. That is a remarkably bullish forecast given the \"headwinds\" King mentioned: weak credit growth, the determination of both households and companies to pay down their debts; the less than sparkling outlook for real income growth and, above all, the unfinished business in the eurozone. In the past, the Bank has tended to be over-optimistic in its predictions for the economy, and most City and independent analysts think it will once again be disappointed. Each month, the Treasury publishes a consensus forecast gathered from banks, research institutes, lobbying groups and consultancies: this puts growth at 0.4% this year and 1.8% in 2013. This looks more realistic than the Threadneedle Street predictions. As Michael Saunders of Citigroup notes, the Bank believes the UK is only three or four quarters away from a robust recovery, despite the legacy of debt, the intensification of the government's austerity programme and the impact on exports of what looks a near-certain recession in the eurozone. The Bank announced last week that it would purchase an additional \u00a350bn of gilts, expanding its quantitative easing programme to \u00a3325bn. If the charts in the inflation report are anything to go by, inflation will be at its 2% target in 2014, and that would suggest no further QE. King made it clear that he believes QE is not subject to diminishing returns and noted that the high level of government borrowing meant there was no shortage of gilts to buy. There is no barrier therefore to a further expansion of QE should the state of the economy warrant it. As it almost certainly will.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne is facing growing pressure to take action to tackle long-term unemployment in next month's budget, after official figures revealed that 860,000 people have now been out of work for more than a year. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, accused Osborne of complacency as the latest snapshot of the labour market by the Office for National Statistics showed the unemployment rate stuck at a 17-year high of 8.4% in the three months to December and the number of women claiming unemployment benefits at the highest level since 1995. The number of people out of work was up by 48,000 on the previous three months to 2.67 million, almost a third of whom have been unable to find work for more than a year. Two-thirds of the increase in unemployment was accounted for by women, who continue to be hit hardest by the deterioration in the labour market. The number of women claiming unemployment benefits has hit 531,700 \u2013 driven partly by government reforms that have forced single mothers to return to the labour market. A record number of people were working part-time as they were unable to find full-time work. \"If we don't act we will pay a long-term price as a society because you can't just get rid of long-term unemployment quickly, we saw that in the 1980s. I fear we are making the same mistake again andI do think the government's got to drop the complacency and start to talk about what can be done,\" Balls told Radio 4. The more timely claimant count measure of unemployment, which tracks the number of people receiving out-of-work benefits, rose by 6,900 in January, to 1.6 million. Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, who has called for a public spending boost to kickstart the economy, described the growing toll of long-term unemployed as \"the cost of inaction\". \"We know that unemployment, especially youth unemployment, has 'scarring' effects; an individual experiencing a spell of unemployment has lower employment probabilities later in life,\" he said. Graeme Cooke, associate director of the Institute of Public Policy Research, said the budget should build on the Youth Contract announced by Osborne in his autumn statement last year and launched by Nick Clegg last week. \"The Youth Contract should be just a first step. Government needs to guarantee a job for everyone out of work for more than a year. The next priority should be areas of the country experiencing the combination of both high unemployment and a low number of vacancies,\" he said. The government and some City economists pointed out the rise in unemployment was the slowest since last June, when the jobs market was deteriorating fast after improving through 2010. The welfare reform minister, Lord Freud, said: \"The latest figures show some encouraging signs of stability despite the challenging economic climate.\" Alan Clarke, of Scotiabank, said that if \"there was any doubt that the UK economy had turned the corner and that the worst news was in the past, then today's labour report should lay those concerns to rest\". However, with 1.12 million women out of work Anna Bird, acting chief executive of the Fawcett Society, urged the government to respond to \"a time of crisis\". Young people are also still bearing the brunt of the downturn, the ONS data showed, with 1.04 million 16 to 24-year-olds out of work in the three months to December, an increase of 22,000 on the previous three months. The unemployment rate among this group is 22.2%. There is little sign that pay is starting to pick up, with average earnings up 2% on a year earlier, according to the ONS \u2013 well below the rate of inflation, which dropped to 3.6% last month. Separate government figures showed that tens of thousands of unemployed people have been made to work without pay or have their benefits removed for at least 13 weeks. The first set of statistics on the government's Mandatory Work Activity (MWA) programme revealed that from when the scheme started in May 2011 until November, 24,010 jobseekers were referred to work for four weeks unpaid for 30 hours a week.",

      "body": "<p>George Osborne is facing growing pressure to take action to tackle long-term unemployment in next month's budget, after official figures revealed that 860,000 people have now been out of work for more than a year.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, accused Osborne of complacency as the latest snapshot of the labour market by the Office for National Statistics showed the unemployment rate stuck at a 17-year high of 8.4% in the three months to December and the number of women claiming unemployment benefits at the highest level since 1995.</p> <p>The number of people out of work was up by 48,000 on the previous three months to 2.67 million, almost a third of whom have been unable to find work for more than a year.</p> <p>Two-thirds of the increase in unemployment was accounted for by women, who continue to be hit hardest by the deterioration in the labour market. The number of women claiming unemployment benefits has hit 531,700 \u2013 driven partly by government reforms that have forced single mothers to return to the labour market. A record number of people were working part-time as they were unable to find full-time work.</p> <p>\"If we don't act we will pay a long-term price as a society because you can't just get rid of long-term unemployment quickly, we saw that in the 1980s. I fear we are making the same mistake again andI do think the government's got to drop the complacency and start to talk about what can be done,\" Balls told Radio 4.</p> <p>The more timely claimant count measure of unemployment, which tracks the number of people receiving out-of-work benefits, rose by 6,900 in January, to 1.6 million.</p> <p>Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, who has called for a public spending boost to kickstart the economy, described the growing toll of long-term unemployed as \"the cost of inaction\".</p> <p>\"We know that unemployment, especially youth unemployment, has 'scarring' effects; an individual experiencing a spell of unemployment has lower employment probabilities later in life,\" he said.</p> <p>Graeme Cooke, associate director of the Institute of Public Policy Research, said the budget should build on the Youth Contract announced by Osborne in his autumn statement last year and launched by Nick Clegg last week. \"The Youth Contract should be just a first step. Government needs to guarantee a job for everyone out of work for more than a year. The next priority should be areas of the country experiencing the combination of both high unemployment and a low number of vacancies,\" he said.</p> <p>The government and some City economists pointed out the rise in unemployment was the slowest since last June, when the jobs market was deteriorating fast after improving through 2010.</p> <p>The welfare reform minister, Lord Freud, said: \"The latest figures show some encouraging signs of stability despite the challenging economic climate.\"</p> <p>Alan Clarke, of Scotiabank, said that if \"there was any doubt that the UK economy had turned the corner and that the worst news was in the past, then today's labour report should lay those concerns to rest\".</p> <p>However, with 1.12 million women out of work Anna Bird, acting chief executive of the Fawcett Society, urged the government to respond to \"a time of crisis\".</p> <p>Young people are also still bearing the brunt of the downturn, the ONS data showed, with 1.04 million 16 to 24-year-olds out of work in the three months to December, an increase of 22,000 on the previous three months. The unemployment rate among this group is 22.2%.</p> <p>There is little sign that pay is starting to pick up, with average earnings up 2% on a year earlier, according to the ONS \u2013 well below the rate of inflation, which dropped to 3.6% last month.</p> <p>Separate government figures showed that tens of thousands of unemployed people have been made to work without pay or have their benefits removed for at least 13 weeks.</p> <p>The first set of statistics on the government's Mandatory Work Activity (MWA) programme revealed that from when the scheme started in May 2011 until November, 24,010 jobseekers were referred to work for four weeks unpaid for 30 hours a week.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fears that Greece is heading towards the eurozone's first sovereign debt default hardened when the country's EU creditors abruptly called off an emergency meeting that was supposed to agree a \u20ac130bn bailout. Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg prime minister and head of the eurogroup, blamed Greece's political leaders for failing to deliver on pledges long demanded of them in return for a new bailout funds. Eurozone finance ministers last week postponed a decision on the rescue amid spiralling mistrust between Athens and its eurozone creditors. A tumultuous weekend of rioting and parliamentary clashes then followed as the Papademos government pushed through a hugely unpopular austerity package to try to secure the money. Last week, Juncker called another snap meeting for which was seen as a deadline for a deal. But the meeting was cancelled. Finance ministers are instead to hold a conference call before gathering for a regular scheduled meeting next Monday. Greece will become the first eurozone country to declare sovereign default next month unless the bailout is granted. But northern European patience with the Greek government is virtually exhausted.

We want everything, a complete package \u2026 If we don't have that clear, we cannot agree with the package.\" Meeting against a background of rioting in Athens on Sunday, the Greek parliament agreed to the eurozone's terms for the bailout, which would take the rescue funds to \u20ac240bn in two years. But European exasperation has been fuelled by the consistent failure of Greek leaders to supply details on how a \u20ac325m funding gap is to be closed \u2013 and by the same politicians (particularly the centre-right leader, Antonis Samaras) refusing to guarantee in writing that the deal cannot be revised following elections in April. \"I did not yet receive the required political assurances from the leaders of the Greek coalition parties on the implementation of the programme,\" said Juncker. Levels of mistrust between Athens and the rest of the eurozone are at unprecedented levels. Weeks of brinkmanship have resulted in a hardening of positions on both sides, making a collapse of bailout plans quite conceivable. Fears that the bailout was tantamount to an exercise in futility were fuelled by new data showing that the Greek economy had shrunk by 7% in the last quarter of 2011. Juncker said he was still awaiting written undertakings from Greek party leaders on pushing through the austerity package of pay, pension and job cuts which parliament passed on Sunday as rioters torched dozens of buildings in central Athens. Intensive talks are going on constantly behind the scenes across Europe over how and whether to save Greece. The crisis dominated a dinner outside Berlin on Monday evening for Scandinavian leaders hosted by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.
