It also cites <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/01/austerity-eurozone-disaster-joseph-stiglitz\" title=\"\">the weakening eurozone economy</a> and geopolitical tensions, including the Ukraine crisis, as threats that are making businesses nervous.</p> <p>The Item Club predicts that business investment growth will slow sharply next year, from 9% in 2014 to 5.8% in 2015. That will hamper economic growth, tipped to fall from 3.1% this year to 2.4% in 2015.</p> <p>The warning comes as new economic data are due that will probably show the British recovery slowed down between July and September.</p> <p>Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, believes that, with polls showing next year\u2019s election is hard to call, the uncertainty and nervousness in the financial markets around the election will be much greater than in 2010.</p> <p>\u201cThis makes it very difficult for anyone engaged in business planning to manage a company through this uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would have had this conversation in 1997.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy could suffer a \u201chuge uncertainty shock\u201d if next year\u2019s general election delivers a hung parliament, a leading economic forecaster warns. The prospect of no clear winner when Britain heads to the polling booths in May is already pushing down next year\u2019s growth and business investment predictions, according to the EY Item Club\u2019s autumn forecast. It also cites the weakening eurozone economy and geopolitical tensions, including the Ukraine crisis, as threats that are making businesses nervous. The Item Club predicts that business investment growth will slow sharply next year, from 9% in 2014 to 5.8% in 2015. That will hamper economic growth, tipped to fall from 3.1% this year to 2.4% in 2015. The warning comes as new economic data are due that will probably show the British recovery slowed down between July and September. Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, believes that, with polls showing next year\u2019s election is hard to call, the uncertainty and nervousness in the financial markets around the election will be much greater than in 2010. \u201cThis makes it very difficult for anyone engaged in business planning to manage a company through this uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would have had this conversation in 1997. The gulf between the parties this time is enormous.\u201d Businesses are also worried by the prospect of a referendum over Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union, Spencer said. \u201cThe comparative advantage we offer foreign investors is dependent on the fact we are a haven of political stability, and our proximity to Europe. If both of those are brought into question, what happens to the likes of Nissan and Toyota, or financial services firms in the City?\u201d Spencer pointed out that Germany\u2019s industrial productivity and exports had fallen sharply in August, as the Ukraine crisis and eurozone fears had risen. \u201cA huge uncertainty shock is really hammering Germany\u2019s economy now,\u201d he said, illustrating the dangers facing Britain. \u201cIt is a very good example of what can happen if businesses get clutched by this sort of risk.\u201d The UK economy is also a long way from regaining its full potential following the financial crisis, he added. The EY Item Club, which uses the Treasury\u2019s model of the UK economy, flagged up that exporters are suffering from the stalling European recovery and the fall in the value of the euro. HM Treasury agreed that the eurozone area, Britain\u2019s largest trade partner, is a \u201cgrowing risk\u201d, saying: \u201cWe have to recognise that the UK is not immune to these problems, which is why we will continue working through the plan that is building a resilient economy.\u201d Data due on Friday will show how the UK economy performed in the third quarter of 2014. Economists predict that GDP increased by 0.7% in the quarter, a slowdown compared with 0.9% between April and June. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said there was a risk that growth could be weaker, given \u201climited industrial production and the very real possibility that construction output contracted\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Buyers forced out of London by spiralling property prices have helped fuel a 10% annual rise in asking prices in the south-east \u2013 a rate that has now outstripped inflation in the capital. Asking prices in the south-east are 10% higher than they were a year ago, said Rightmove, compared with a rise of 9.6% in London. This makes the region the strongest performing in the country over the last 12 months. \u201cThe ripple effect of buyers priced out of London combined with those cashing in and moving out of the capital means that the south-east has taken London\u2019s boom-town crown,\u201d said Miles Shipside, a director at Rightmove. \u201cUpwards price pressure is being further fuelled by a reluctance of homeowners in the hotspots of the south-east to come to market.\u201d Across the country, the price of property going on sale in October has increased by 2.6% compared with September. That pushes the asking price of the average house up by almost \u00a37,000, to \u00a3271,669, said Rightmove. Average asking prices are \u00a3355,874 in the south-east and \u00a3596,692 in London. Earlier this month, in a report prepared in conjunction with the independent consultancy Oxford Economics, Rightmove forecast that the south-east would be the region with the highest increase in property values in the next five years. It predicts the national average price will grow by a huge 30%, with the south-east seeing rises of 37% and London 33%. The report predicted that Southampton would see the fastest increases in the country over the next five years, with values expected to jump 43% by 2019, adding nearly \u00a3100,000 to local prices. \u201cThose looking for the best price appreciation in the country should seriously consider the south-east, and some may wish to fine-tune their search to the top three locations of Southampton, Brighton and Luton,\u201d said Shipside. Despite the bullish longer term forecast from Rightmove, it conceded that overall house price inflation was slowing. The 2.6% national monthly asking price increase this month is the lowest October rise for six years. Shipside said: \u201cSellers may still find that their asking prices are too optimistic in parts of the country where the supply of property exceeds buyer demand\u201d. A smaller increase, or even a fall, in the sale price of property would tally with the predictions made in a number of other recent forecasts. Most recently the Centre for Economics and Business Research said it expected average house prices across the UK to dip by 0.8% in 2015 after growing by an estimated 7.8% this year. The rental market also appears to be slowing, with the monthly price paid by tenants falling in eight regions of the UK in September, according to the tenant referencing agency HomeLet. The average monthly private rent in the UK (excluding London) is now \u00a3728, and \u00a31,466 in London, it said. Despite the falls in areas such as Scotland, the south-east and east Midlands, overall rents have risen by 8.2% across the country in the last year, said HomeLet, part of the Barbon Insurance Group. Even excluding London from the figure brings rental inflation to an annual 4.6%. \u201cThere can be an element of seasonality to the rental market, with September often recording marginally lower average prices than other months, perhaps due to the number of student letting agreements being signed at this time of year,\u201d said Martin Totty, Barbon Insurance Group\u2019s chief executive. \u201cHowever, with this month\u2019s data being the second consecutive month of slower rental price growth, and house prices indices indicating a slowing of growth, this could suggest movement to a period of more settled rental prices.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2014 to correct the name of the Barbon Insurance Group.

      "body": "<p>Food. </p> <p>So basic. So delicious. So necessary. </p> <p>Everyone eats, Matt Salzberg, one of the founders of <a href=\"https://www.blueapron.com\">Blue Apron</a>, reminds me when we start chatting. But cooking can be really stressful. Trying to think of dinner while at work, struggling to remember what ingredients one has at home, rushing to the market before heading home. Forget an ingredient, skip a step in a recipe, and the meal might turn out completely different. Instead of the joy of cooking, it\u2019s one more for the to-do list.<br></p> <p>With the rise of foodies and more people attempting to cook at home sans stress, companies like <a href=\"http://www.hellofresh.com/?wt_sb=13292458487_41440196087&amp;wt_skb=13292458487_hello%20fresh&amp;gclid=CM-G68Xrl8ECFSXKtAodGCwAOw\">HelloFresh</a>, <a href=\"http://www.chefday.com/\">Chefday</a>, <a href=\"https://www.plated.com/l/menu-free?utm_campaign=Search&amp;utm_content=45370116483&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_source=google_branded&amp;utm_term=plated&amp;step=1\">Plated</a> and Blue Apron are competing for the opportunity to get into your kitchen and stay there. Taking care of the shopping \u2013 helping you avoid the missing ingredient scenario \u2013 these startups deliver all the necessary items to your doorstep, recipe included. All you have to do is cook and enjoy.</p> <p>Salzberg loves to cook. Yet, trips to his local supermarket left him disappointed - where were the fresh ingredients, fresh produce that just begged to be eaten? And so, Blue Apron was born. </p> <p>Launched in 2012, Blue Apron consisted mostly of its three founders \u2013 Salzberg, Ilia Papas and Matthew Wadiak \u2013 packing ingredients and recipes into boxes to be sent to their first consumers. Today, the New York-based company employs over 500 people and delivers more than 800,000 meals each month nationwide.</p> <p>For about $9.99 a meal per person, Blue Apron subscribers receive ingredients and the recipes for three meals each week. The only catch: someone still has to do the dishes afterward. <br></p> <p>We caught up with Salzberg to talk about his management style, the growth of the company and its partnerships with its suppliers. Below is an edited transcript of our conversation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://instagram.com/blueapron\" data-alt=\"US Money Global Edge blue apron bleuberries\">  <iframe src=\"//instagram.com/p/oMFGlURBAd/embed/\" width=\"460\" height=\"525\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> <figcaption>Blue Apron is a symbol of lifelong learning, says the company co-founder. </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Your company and others like it are disrupting the way we get our groceries and cook our food. What does the future look like?</strong></strong></strong></strong></p> <p>We are helping people go more directly to the source of their food. People care about where their food comes from and with Blue Apron, you get your food directly from farms. You get more locally sourced food, more seasonally consumed food. [You get to] eat different ingredients when they are at their peak freshness and when they are in season. [You are] getting back to the kitchen, having fun while cooking.</p> <p>Cooking itself is an experience that should be fun. You should do it with your friends and family and you should enjoy it. With a service like ours, we allow people to actually enjoy that experience and eat more healthy at the same time and get closer connected to the suppliers, who are selling them the food rather than having that food sit on a shelf for days before it gets to them.</p> <p>Fundamentally, what we are trying to do is make home cooking more accessible. When you see a celebrity chef cooking an incredible meal on TV and in a restaurant that would cost you $50 per person or more, we think that that kind of food is something that should be for everybody and should be accessible to everybody. The way we are approaching the supply chain and the product experience, that\u2019s what we are doing \u2013 making it available, accessible and at a great price point so that everyone across the country can have access to that food.</p> <p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Did you ever imagine that you would own a company like this?</strong></strong></strong></strong></p> <p>Every job interview I\u2019ve ever had in my life, I\u2019ve said in the interview that I wanted to leave and start my own company someday. So, it\u2019s always been an aspiration of mine. Before this job, my favourite job I ever had was when I was in college and I ran a student-run laundry service which was an amazing job. <br></p> <p>After college, I went into finance. I worked with a lot of entrepreneurs and business leaders and got to see a lot of different companies out there and a lot of different management styles and approaches. I wanted to create something that would truly impact the daily lives of customers across the country and to build a brand that people would use and love. <br></p> <p><strong><strong><strong><strong>You mention you have been looking at how entrepreneurs work and their management style. How would you describe</strong></strong></strong></strong><em><strong><strong><strong><strong> your </strong></strong></strong></strong></em><strong><strong><strong><strong>management style?</strong></strong></strong></strong></p> <p>I think my management style has changed a lot. In the very first days of our company, literally my co-founders and I were packing boxes ourselves in a tiny kitchen in Long Island City. So the management style that is required is very micro-management. You have to do everything yourselves. You have to be able to do all the analysis yourself, make all the decisions yourselves. Personally, you have to see things differently.</p> <p>Once the company grows to 10, 20 people, that kind of style doesn\u2019t work any more. As you get towards 500 people, it <em>really </em>doesn\u2019t work any more. And so you know, now, it\u2019s much more important for us as a company to give people the tools that they need and delegate. We have managers who I tried to be pretty hands-off with after setting the expectations, goals, the culture and approach [of Blue Apron].</p> <p>As a company, we have a couple of values. One of our most important values is lifelong learning and that actually comes from the name of the company \u2013 the Blue Apron. Chefs around the world wear blue aprons when they are learning to cook and it\u2019s a symbol of life-long learning in cooking. So that\u2019s what our brand represents to our customers \u2013 introducing them to new techniques, new recipes, new ideas and improving. We, as a company, take it really seriously. We are continuously trying to improve everything we do between operations, marketing, purchasing, product, you name it.</p> <p>That\u2019s an important value that all of our managers try to represent.</p> <p>We are also very analytical and numbers-focused. We make decisions on the basis of data and facts, rather than our gut. Though, often, our gut dictates things like: what is a great recipe? what is a great product? But we make decisions based on our experience, things like A/B testing frameworks and fiscal analysis, which help us avoid the noise and make objectively intelligent decisions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-63ad7c5a-57cb-4d34-a636-81eed39bf4fb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/13/1410649187576/bebf8aaf-e70a-411d-8c9b-2e4a447cb0de-460x460.png\" alt=\"US Money Global Edge Blue apron recipe cards\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Each Blue Apron delivery comes with a set of detailed recipe cards. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Blue Apron</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><strong><strong><strong>How do you communicate to your employees your strategy?</strong></strong></strong></strong></p> <p>We do a lot of things actually. The most important thing that we do is we hold a monthly all-hands company meeting where all the different divisions of the company present via teleconference to all the different offices of the company, so that they can see all the interesting projects, accomplishments and priorities each of those different divisions [has]. For us, it\u2019s really really important because we are a very cross-functional company. Think about what we do. It\u2019s very difficult. It requires coordination between our culinary team, which plans the menus, between our purchasing team, which works with local farms and family-run businesses, and our operations and our marketing teams to make sure that everything works so that we can deliver a truly flawless at-home experience to our customer [so that] it turns out the same way in their kitchen as it turned out in our test kitchen.</p> <p>Making that all work out is actually very hard. We also have weekly updates that the teams send out in email format to other groups around the company and we have weekly team meetings, which allow people to sync up and coordinate on their own as well.</p> <p><strong><strong>One of the reasons you said you came up with the company is because you had a difficulty finding fresh ingredients. Who do you partner with to get your products?</strong></strong></p> <p>We have literally a hundreds of suppliers we work with and we have a team of purchasers who are experts at sorting food and their job is to go out every week and to find the freshest and the most seasonal ingredients that they can find from the best supplier that they can find and source them at best prices for our customer. We manage the negotiations on the customer\u2019s behalf. We manage the finding of the best seasonality in produce and finding the suppliers with the most interesting stories and with sustainable practices.</p> <p>In many cases we will work with a farm and have them grow a specific item just for us, which is really cool. We actually just recently did a recipe with a Michael Anthony from Gramercy Tavern. He co-created a recipe for us and we had a graffiti eggplant, which is a special kind of an eggplant grown by a local farm specially for our customers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://instagram.com/blueapron\" data-alt=\"US Money Global Edge blue apron lemon\">  <iframe src=\"//instagram.com/p/nRUjhpRBMi/embed/\" width=\"460\" height=\"530\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>For us, as we grow, getting more and more integrated with our supply team is really important. And, by the way, we are not just delivering recipes, we are delivering the ingredients too. A dependent part of the experience is also providing interesting ingredients that people don\u2019t normally cook with on their own at home, ingredients that they don\u2019t have access to at their local grocery store because they either aren\u2019t mass-produced commercial items, they are things like heirloom varieties and interesting greens what you wouldn\u2019t even know what to do with on your own at home.</p> <p>Telling the stories of the suppliers that we work with, that\u2019s a lot of the fun. Hearing about a local family-run business or a local farm is the story behind the food and knowing where your food comes from. That\u2019s something that we are increasingly doing and our customers love.</p> <p><strong><strong>What are you hearing from your suppliers? Are they excited? Do they come to you with ideas?</strong></strong><br></p> <p>It works in a lot of different ways. Our suppliers suggest things to us. We work with a family-run fresh pasta company that comes up with new pastas all the time and suggests them to us.</p> <p>If you think about it, one of the troubles in the food business, there is a lot of ingredients that people just don\u2019t know what to do with on their own. We teach people how to use those ingredients. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-11d4bf6d-b21c-420d-a2df-4ef8f8b02fde\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/14/1410649280181/a84ec6ae-9b46-4b30-9dc5-6c35ba1463b8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Us Money Blue apron box \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the benefits of Blue Apron is that you\u2019ll never find yourself missing an ingredient. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Blue Apron</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><strong>I\u2019ve worked in restaurants for years and one of the most awkward moments is when someone does not like their food. All of these people are trying to cook your food at home \u2013 do they like it? What is some of the feedback you\u2019ve been getting? <br></strong></strong></p> <p>Customer service is hugely important for us. We have invested a lot in having a great customer service team and building the right attitude for them, which is to help make customers happy and successful in the kitchen. It\u2019s product that\u2019s very personal for people. We are in their homes every night. They are actually cooking and eating our product. It\u2019s something they can do with their friends, their families. They take photos of it, share it on social networks. It requires a very careful customer service approach to make sure that we enable our customers in a way that we want.</p> <p>We get all sorts of feedback under the sun from our customers \u2013 \u201cWe want more of this\u201d, \u201dWe want more of that\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s a balancing act for us to provide a product that we can, at scale, that\u2019s still delicious and fun and interesting for people. One of the things we like about product experience is that it\u2019s meant to be a passive experience for customers. While they can\u2019t actively choose our meals that they want, we will send them a delivery every week and they\u2019ll get to try new things that they haven\u2019t tried before.</p> <p>That\u2019s the most interesting feedback we get \u2013 when someone tells us: \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t think I liked salmon before, but it was only because I was cooking it wrong. Or I didn\u2019t know what to do with it. I actually love salmon. Thank you for showing that to me.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s what we try to do a lot with a way we design our product.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://instagram.com/blueapron\" data-alt=\"US Money Blue apron avocado Global Edge\">  <iframe src=\"//instagram.com/p/lN96v8RBOs/embed/\" width=\"460\" height=\"525\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong><strong>You\u2019ve mentioned scale. Blue Apron has grown over the years. What are some fun parts of growing a company? What are some things to keep an eye on?</strong></strong></p> <p>The fun things are seeing customers across the country using your product. <br></p> <p>We actually get love letters from people saying things like: \u201cYou have changed my life.\u201d \u201cYou have saved my marriage.\u201d That really keeps the team going. Actually, our customer service team sends a weekly round-up of all that great feedback that we get to the whole team.</p> <p>The other side, organisationally, it\u2019s seeing the company come alive on its own. Like I said, at the early stage you do everything yourself, and when you are doing that and you are hit by a bus, the company would collapse. But as the company gets bigger, you attract great people and business starts making decisions on its own without you direct involvement in them. It\u2019s really cool to see that kind of environment begin to flourish.</p> <p>The difficult parts are when you are growing really fast, it\u2019s hard to plan for rapid growth. We have, historically, been habitually understaffed and overworked. We have great people who have helped us along with that but you know that\u2019s absolutely the most challenging thing \u2013 planning for unknown volumes and growths in the future.</p>",

One of our most important values is lifelong learning and that actually comes from the name of the company \u2013 the Blue Apron. Chefs around the world wear blue aprons when they are learning to cook and it\u2019s a symbol of life-long learning in cooking. So that\u2019s what our brand represents to our customers \u2013 introducing them to new techniques, new recipes, new ideas and improving. We, as a company, take it really seriously. We are continuously trying to improve everything we do between operations, marketing, purchasing, product, you name it. That\u2019s an important value that all of our managers try to represent. We are also very analytical and numbers-focused. We make decisions on the basis of data and facts, rather than our gut. Though, often, our gut dictates things like: what is a great recipe? what is a great product? But we make decisions based on our experience, things like A/B testing frameworks and fiscal analysis, which help us avoid the noise and make objectively intelligent decisions. How do you communicate to your employees your strategy? We do a lot of things actually. The most important thing that we do is we hold a monthly all-hands company meeting where all the different divisions of the company present via teleconference to all the different offices of the company, so that they can see all the interesting projects, accomplishments and priorities each of those different divisions [has]. For us, it\u2019s really really important because we are a very cross-functional company. Think about what we do. It\u2019s very difficult. It requires coordination between our culinary team, which plans the menus, between our purchasing team, which works with local farms and family-run businesses, and our operations and our marketing teams to make sure that everything works so that we can deliver a truly flawless at-home experience to our customer [so that] it turns out the same way in their kitchen as it turned out in our test kitchen. Making that all work out is actually very hard. We also have weekly updates that the teams send out in email format to other groups around the company and we have weekly team meetings, which allow people to sync up and coordinate on their own as well. One of the reasons you said you came up with the company is because you had a difficulty finding fresh ingredients. Who do you partner with to get your products? We have literally a hundreds of suppliers we work with and we have a team of purchasers who are experts at sorting food and their job is to go out every week and to find the freshest and the most seasonal ingredients that they can find from the best supplier that they can find and source them at best prices for our customer. We manage the negotiations on the customer\u2019s behalf. We manage the finding of the best seasonality in produce and finding the suppliers with the most interesting stories and with sustainable practices. In many cases we will work with a farm and have them grow a specific item just for us, which is really cool. We actually just recently did a recipe with a Michael Anthony from Gramercy Tavern. He co-created a recipe for us and we had a graffiti eggplant, which is a special kind of an eggplant grown by a local farm specially for our customers. For us, as we grow, getting more and more integrated with our supply team is really important. And, by the way, we are not just delivering recipes, we are delivering the ingredients too. A dependent part of the experience is also providing interesting ingredients that people don\u2019t normally cook with on their own at home, ingredients that they don\u2019t have access to at their local grocery store because they either aren\u2019t mass-produced commercial items, they are things like heirloom varieties and interesting greens what you wouldn\u2019t even know what to do with on your own at home. Telling the stories of the suppliers that we work with, that\u2019s a lot of the fun. Hearing about a local family-run business or a local farm is the story behind the food and knowing where your food comes from. That\u2019s something that we are increasingly doing and our customers love. What are you hearing from your suppliers? Are they excited? Do they come to you with ideas? It works in a lot of different ways. Our suppliers suggest things to us. We work with a family-run fresh pasta company that comes up with new pastas all the time and suggests them to us. If you think about it, one of the troubles in the food business, there is a lot of ingredients that people just don\u2019t know what to do with on their own. We teach people how to use those ingredients. I\u2019ve worked in restaurants for years and one of the most awkward moments is when someone does not like their food. All of these people are trying to cook your food at home \u2013 do they like it? What is some of the feedback you\u2019ve been getting? Customer service is hugely important for us. We have invested a lot in having a great customer service team and building the right attitude for them, which is to help make customers happy and successful in the kitchen. It\u2019s product that\u2019s very personal for people. We are in their homes every night. They are actually cooking and eating our product. It\u2019s something they can do with their friends, their families. They take photos of it, share it on social networks. It requires a very careful customer service approach to make sure that we enable our customers in a way that we want. We get all sorts of feedback under the sun from our customers \u2013 \u201cWe want more of this\u201d, \u201dWe want more of that\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s a balancing act for us to provide a product that we can, at scale, that\u2019s still delicious and fun and interesting for people. One of the things we like about product experience is that it\u2019s meant to be a passive experience for customers. While they can\u2019t actively choose our meals that they want, we will send them a delivery every week and they\u2019ll get to try new things that they haven\u2019t tried before. That\u2019s the most interesting feedback we get \u2013 when someone tells us: \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t think I liked salmon before, but it was only because I was cooking it wrong. Or I didn\u2019t know what to do with it. I actually love salmon. Thank you for showing that to me.\u201d That\u2019s what we try to do a lot with a way we design our product. You\u2019ve mentioned scale. Blue Apron has grown over the years. What are some fun parts of growing a company? What are some things to keep an eye on? The fun things are seeing customers across the country using your product. We actually get love letters from people saying things like: \u201cYou have changed my life.\u201d \u201cYou have saved my marriage.\u201d That really keeps the team going. Actually, our customer service team sends a weekly round-up of all that great feedback that we get to the whole team. The other side, organisationally, it\u2019s seeing the company come alive on its own. Like I said, at the early stage you do everything yourself, and when you are doing that and you are hit by a bus, the company would collapse. But as the company gets bigger, you attract great people and business starts making decisions on its own without you direct involvement in them. It\u2019s really cool to see that kind of environment begin to flourish. The difficult parts are when you are growing really fast, it\u2019s hard to plan for rapid growth. We have, historically, been habitually understaffed and overworked. We have great people who have helped us along with that but you know that\u2019s absolutely the most challenging thing \u2013 planning for unknown volumes and growths in the future.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The graph below may resemble a mountain range, all plunging valleys and soaring peaks. In fact, it tells a remarkable story of social and economic change, a story that ends bleakly for millions of medium and low-paid Britons \u2013 one of relentless forces cutting deep into occupations that have traditionally made up our economic landscape, and driving ever lower the real wages of all but the most fortunate and best-paid of the country\u2019s employees. As Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, noted in a speech last week, real wages (wages adjusted for inflation) have fallen by around 10% from their pre-recession peak. This represents a fall in living standards that is unprecedented since the middle of the 19th century. As the chart shows, it is very rare for real wages in the UK to fall continually over a seven-year period. They have done so only three times in the past 150 years: after a deep recession in the late 19th century; in the 1930s, following the Great Depression; and again in the past seven years. This historical coincidence of deep recessions and falling real wages might suggest that the events of the last seven years were predictable \u2013 and that, if the economic recovery is sustained, real wages will start to rise again soon. But the chart masks some longer-term trends that indicate a gloomier outlook, at least for some workers. Even before the financial crisis, real wages for those on the lowest pay were rising less rapidly than for those at the top. As a consequence of the recent falls, for those in the bottom 20% of the earnings distribution, real pay is back to its 1997 level. Meanwhile, the top 10% have seen their real pay increase by about 20% over the same period. Clearly something very unusual is happening in the labour market and it is not just a post-recession phenomenon. The recession has merely exacerbated a trend that has been in place for the past three decades: a polarisation of the labour market. Employment growth has been strongest in the high-skilled and low-skilled occupations, but the number of jobs requiring mid-skilled workers \u2013 skilled tradespeople, machine operatives and administrative and secretarial workers \u2013 is shrinking. The growth of technology in the workplace means many jobs that existed 30 years ago are no longer required. Across whole swaths of industry, workers on production lines have been gradually replaced by robots. Factories that once employed tens, or even hundreds, of people are now run by machines and a handful of maintenance workers. Furthermore, competition from low-wage countries, such as China, means many manufacturing industries \u2013 and the jobs they supported \u2013 no longer exist or are much diminished. In the mid-1980s, one in every five people employed in the UK worked in manufacturing, many of them in mid-skilled jobs. By last year, that figure had fallen to one in 12. Offices have changed as well. No longer are they populated by filing and accounts clerks and typing pools. Records are stored on computer databases and spreadsheets, and everyone does their own typing. High-skilled workers are in more demand because they are able to make maximum use of new technologies. The most rapid growth in employment in recent years has been among professionals and technicians who possess the digital skills to exploit technological change. Meanwhile, there has also been strong growth in the number of low-skilled, low-paid workers \u2013 just look at all the coffee and sandwich shops that populate the typical high street compared with 10 years ago. The mystery is why rapid growth in demand for high-skilled workers has seen their real wages rise over the past 20 years, while similar rapid growth in demand for low-skilled workers has been associated with real wage stagnation. The answer is that there are more people chasing every low-skilled job than every high-skilled one. Mid-skilled workers who lose their jobs initially try to find a comparable job that makes full use of their talents. Some succeed but, because of the shrinking number of mid-skilled jobs, many do not. They do not have the qualifications to move up the skills ladder, so eventually they are forced to move down it and compete for low-skilled jobs. Employers faced with many applicants for every low-skilled vacancy are therefore under no pressure to increase wages. At the same time, increasing numbers of people who cannot find the type of work they want are opting for self-employment, even though it means earning less than they formerly did. Although these trends have been in place for around 30 years, they have been amplified in the past seven years while unemployment has been above its pre-recession level. It ought, therefore, to be good news for real wages that over the past two years unemployment has been falling steadily. Having peaked at 8.5% in 2011, it is now back down to 6%, and on current trends will be back to its pre-recession level next year. There is a good chance that this will bring an end to the longest period of wage slump the UK has experienced in the past 150 years. However, as Haldane also noted, the Bank has been wrongly forecasting an imminent increase in real wages since 2008. Anyone expecting a surge in real wages is likely to be disappointed, because new technologies will continue to destroy some jobs, thereby providing a steady stream of workers competing for the low-skilled jobs that remain. The pace of technological change is now so rapid that it is difficult to predict which jobs it will threaten next. Improvements in the algorithms that translate text and speech from one language to another will one day make translators redundant. Driverless vehicles, which only a few years ago were unimaginable to most, will mean we no longer need lorry or taxi drivers. And on-line education resources could replace university lecturers. These changes may be beneficial for society as a whole, but they are creating great disruption in the jobs market in the short-term. And, ultimately, they are responsible for a large part of the decline in real wages that led to yesterday\u2019s protests.

They have done so only three times in the past 150 years: after a deep recession in the late 19th century; in the 1930s, following the Great Depression; and again in the past seven years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35f8d785439be8396909489a32e658e9ac51eec2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/18/1413655539624/cf494b8f-9602-40e4-970c-53274497be9f-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"UK real wages\" width=\"460\" height=\"316\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK real wages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guim</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This historical coincidence of deep recessions and falling real wages might suggest that the events of the last seven years were predictable \u2013 and that, if the economic recovery is sustained, real wages will start to rise again soon. But the chart masks some longer-term trends that indicate a gloomier outlook, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/18/under-30s-priced-out-of-uk-alan-milburn\" title=\"\">at least for some workers</a>.</p> <p>Even before the financial crisis, real wages for those on the lowest pay were rising less rapidly than for those at the top. As a consequence of the recent falls, for those in the bottom 20% of the earnings distribution, real pay is back to its 1997 level. Meanwhile, the top 10% have seen their real pay increase by about 20% over the same period.</p> <p>Clearly something very unusual is happening in the labour market and it is not just a post-recession phenomenon. The recession has merely exacerbated a trend that has been in place for the past three decades: a polarisation of the labour market.</p> <p>Employment growth has been strongest in the high-skilled and low-skilled occupations, but the number of jobs requiring mid-skilled workers \u2013 skilled tradespeople, machine operatives and administrative and secretarial workers \u2013 is shrinking.</p> <p>The growth of technology in the workplace means many jobs that existed 30 years ago are no longer required. Across whole swaths of industry, workers on production lines have been gradually replaced by robots. Factories that once employed tens, or even hundreds, of people are now run by machines and a handful of maintenance workers.</p> <p>Furthermore, competition from low-wage countries, such as China, means many manufacturing industries \u2013 and the jobs they supported \u2013 no longer exist or are much diminished. In the mid-1980s, one in every five people employed in the UK worked in manufacturing, many of them in mid-skilled jobs. By last year, that figure had fallen to one in 12.</p> <p>Offices have changed as well. No longer are they populated by filing and accounts clerks and typing pools. Records are stored on computer databases and spreadsheets, and everyone does their own typing. High-skilled workers are in more demand because they are able to make maximum use of new technologies. The most rapid growth in employment in recent years has been among professionals and technicians who possess the digital skills to exploit technological change.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there has also been strong growth in the number of low-skilled, low-paid workers \u2013 just look at all the coffee and sandwich shops that populate the typical high street compared with 10 years ago. The mystery is why rapid growth in demand for high-skilled workers has seen their real wages rise over the past 20 years, while similar rapid growth in demand for low-skilled workers has been associated with real wage stagnation. The answer is that there are more people chasing every low-skilled job than every high-skilled one.</p> <p>Mid-skilled workers who lose their jobs initially try to find a comparable job that makes full use of their talents. Some succeed but, because of the shrinking number of mid-skilled jobs, many do not. They do not have the qualifications to move up the skills ladder, so eventually they are forced to move down it and compete for low-skilled jobs. Employers faced with many applicants for every low-skilled vacancy are therefore under no pressure to increase wages. At the same time, increasing numbers of people who cannot find the type of work they want are opting for self-employment, even though it means earning less than they formerly did.</p> <p>Although these trends have been in place for around 30 years, they have been amplified in the past seven years while unemployment has been above its pre-recession level. It ought, therefore, to be good news for real wages that over the past two years unemployment has been falling steadily. Having peaked at 8.5% in 2011, it is now back down to 6%, and on current trends will be back to its pre-recession level next year.</p> <p>There is a good chance that this will bring an end to the longest period of wage slump the UK has experienced in the past 150 years. However, as Haldane also noted, the Bank has been wrongly forecasting an imminent increase in real wages since 2008. Anyone expecting a surge in real wages is likely to be disappointed, because new technologies will continue to destroy some jobs, thereby providing a steady stream of workers competing for the low-skilled jobs that remain.</p> <p>The pace of technological change is now so rapid that it is difficult to predict which jobs it will threaten next. Improvements in the algorithms that translate text and speech from one language to another will one day make translators redundant. Driverless vehicles, which only a few years ago were unimaginable to most, will mean we no longer need lorry or taxi drivers. And on-line education resources could replace university lecturers.</p> <p>These changes may be beneficial for society as a whole, but they are creating great disruption in the jobs market in the short-term. And, ultimately, they are responsible for a large part of the decline in real wages that led to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/18/tens-thousands-uk-streets-pay-protest-march-union\" title=\"\">yesterday\u2019s protests</a>. <br><br><em>Tony Dolphin is chief economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research </em></p>",
