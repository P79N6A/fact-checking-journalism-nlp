The good news is that the significant decline in chain retailers numbers in town centres in 2012 is slowing down.\" High street winners and losers Charity shops Outlets: +97 Percentage change: +2.8% Cheque cashing Outlets: +62 Percentage change: +10.4% Betting shops Outlets: +53 Percentage change: 2.2% Convenience stores Outlets: +52 Percentage change: +3.6% Photography shops Outlets: -132 Percentage change: -24.3% Women's clothes Outlets: -122 Percentage change: -3.3% Video rentals Outlets: -104 Percentage changed: -47.9% Banks/financial Outlets: -78 Percentage change: -1.9%",

      "bodyText": "Centrica on Monday blamed the government as it abandoned plans to build two gas storage facilities that would have created hundreds of jobs and increased the security of energy supplies in the UK. With the owner of British Gas expected to increase prices to consumers in the coming days, the company said it would not build a gas storage plant at Baird, in the North Sea, and put on hold \"indefinitely\" a project at Claythorpe in East Yorkshire. The decision will cost Centrica \u00a3240m, which will be taken as an exceptional cost in its 2013 results, and was made after energy minister Michael Fallon concluded this month that subsidies would not be offered to encourage companies to build more gas storage. Centrica said the move left the UK with the capacity to store 21 days of gas supplies, in stark contrast to countries in continental Europe, where France and Germany, for instance, have 122 days and 99 days respectively. The company owns the biggest storage facility, Rough, capable on its own of holding 15 days' supply of gas. Baird, if it had gone ahead, would have added a further 13.5 days and potentially created hundreds of jobs building the site and more permanent ones after it was completed. The UK has become increasingly reliant on gas imports in recent years and the lack of gas storage was highlighted this year when it emerged the country had come within hours of running out. In May Rob Hastings, director of energy and infrastructure at the Crown Estate, which owns gas storage under the sea bed, admitted the UK had at one point in March just six hours of supply left in storage. Hastings told the Financial Times: \"We really only had six hours' worth of gas left in storage as a buffer.\" It followed the record low temperatures in March, which bolstered demand for heating at time when a pipeline was also damaged.

Centrica, which has pulled out of building nuclear plants in the UK, cited \"weak economics\" for withdrawing from the gas storage facilities. This relates to the narrowing difference between the price of gas in the winter and the summer, which had previously allowed companies to rely on selling gas more expensively in the winter than it was bought in the summer. Centrica had warned in July that it might need government support for the projects because of the market conditions. Decc pointed to two more storage facilities under construction in Cheshire, at Stublach and Hill Top Farm, as adding to storage next year and said two storage facilities were opened at Aldbrough, Yorkshire, in November 2012, and Holford, Cheshire, in February 2013.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "How long is the long-term? For most companies operating long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) for executives, it means three years. That's the period over which performance tends to be measured. Qualifying shares are then dished out and recipients are free to turn their paper gains into hard cash by selling. Three years, though, will not fit many people's definition of the long-term. The great banking bust of 2007-08 was preceded by at least half a decade of boom-time thinking in boardrooms that contributed to the severity of the fall. Or, to take a non-banking example, Punch Taverns' model of massive balance sheet leverage worked splendidly from the turn of the century until about 2007, when the roof fell in. In similar fashion, miners Rio Tinto and Xstrata had to go cap in hand to their shareholders for rights-issue cash in 2009 despite enjoying a bull market in commodities that dated from 2001. But these examples \u2013 and others \u2013 have not led to an across-the-board rethink of the nature of the \"long term\" as it applies to executives' incentives. Some big banks and miners, scarred by experience, have moved but they are the exception. Fund manager Fidelity Worldwide Investment found that only 14 companies in the UK out of 304 surveyed operate LTIPs that extend to five years. Dominic Rossi of Fidelity suggests a modest reform: keep the vesting period at three years but make executives hold their shares for a further two. So, in effect, a three-year scheme would become a five-year scheme overnight. This is an idea worth supporting. It might have made little difference in reigning in gung-ho boards of old; but it might help to curb the curse of short-termism in future. Fidelity will back its words with action. From next year, it will vote against the pay report of any company in the UK and the rest of Europe operating an LTIP with a holding period of three years or less; from 2015, it will give support only where holding periods are at least five years. Fidelity is a big beast with \u00a3160bn under management, so its threat has to be taken seriously by remuneration committees in the new era of binding votes on pay. Other big fund managers ought to take notice too. If only a few join the cause, companies would quickly rejig their LTIPs. Schroders, M&amp;G, Legal &amp; General, Blackrock, Aviva Investors, where do you stand?",

That's the period over which performance tends to be measured. Qualifying shares are then dished out and recipients are free to turn their paper gains into hard cash by selling.</p> <p>Three years, though, will not fit many people's definition of the long-term. The great banking bust of 2007-08 was preceded by at least half a decade of boom-time thinking in boardrooms that contributed to the severity of the fall. Or, to take a non-banking example, Punch Taverns' model of massive balance sheet leverage worked splendidly from the turn of the century until about 2007, when the roof fell in. In similar fashion, miners Rio Tinto and Xstrata had to go cap in hand to their shareholders for rights-issue cash in 2009 despite enjoying a bull market in commodities that dated from 2001.</p> <p>But these examples \u2013 and others \u2013 have not led to an across-the-board rethink of the nature of the \"long term\" as it applies to executives' incentives. Some big banks and miners, scarred by experience, have moved but they are the exception. Fund manager Fidelity Worldwide Investment found that only 14 companies in the UK out of 304 surveyed operate LTIPs that extend to five years.</p> <p>Dominic Rossi of Fidelity suggests a modest reform: keep the vesting period at three years but make executives hold their shares for a further two. So, in effect, a three-year scheme would become a five-year scheme overnight. This is an idea worth supporting. It might have made little difference in reigning in gung-ho boards of old; but it might help to curb the curse of short-termism in future.</p> <p>Fidelity will back its words with action. From next year, it will vote against the pay report of any company in the UK and the rest of Europe operating an LTIP with a holding period of three years or less; from 2015, it will give support only where holding periods are at least five years. Fidelity is a big beast with \u00a3160bn under management, so its threat has to be taken seriously by remuneration committees in the new era of binding votes on pay.</p> <p>Other big fund managers ought to take notice too. If only a few join the cause, companies would quickly rejig their LTIPs. Schroders, M&amp;G, Legal &amp; General, Blackrock, Aviva Investors, where do you stand?</p>",

Merkel\u2019s landslide victory comes with a twist as much of her party\u2019s strength was due to voters abandoning ship from the coalition partner FDP. Thus, the election result leaves Merkel in need of forming an awkward coalition with either the SPD or the Greens.</p> <p>The storyline goes that one of these coalitions will be more \u201cEU friendly\u201d as the parties to the left tend to lean toward more generosity toward the EU project than Merkel. But even a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d with the SPD if likely to be anything but grand and the greater risk from here is that Germany\u2019s leadership in Europe risks being as weak as Merkel\u2019s victory in the elections was strong. That\u2019s at least in part because every EU-related decision in Germany will be a nervous exercise in calculating the effects of domestic politics within an uncomfortable coalition.</p> <p><strong>From here, Merkel is likely to try to continue the approach that has brought her relative success so far, making small concessions here and there, such as a small third bailout in Greece, to stem the risk that any individual crisis triggers a wider contagion. What we won\u2019t see is a new overall vision for Europe. The on-going Big Question for Europe is the fundamental tension that will tear Europe apart if it is not eventually addressed: the single currency and single central bank within a multiple-sovereign union.</strong></p> <p><strong>The EU is a house without a foundation, and such a house can\u2019t stand forever. And a new Merkel-led coalition will not put Germany on a path toward building that foundation, it will merely see Germany continuing to send out the repairmen to plaster over the cracks that are appearing in the walls as the house continues to destabilize</strong>.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-523ff8b0e4b018876726dba4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-23T08:37:36.774Z\">9.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Francesco Papadia, who used to run market operations for the European Central Bank, believes the German election results could be good news for the eurozone.</p> <p>He tweets that Angel Merkel will no longer be 'captive' to right-wing views, should she form a grand coalition with the Social Democrats:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FrancescoPapad1/statuses/382056234930548736\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Anti <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23euro&amp;src=hash\">#euro</a> parties out of Bundestag, FDP likely substituted by pro-euro SDP, Merkel not captive of her right: could one hope more for euro?</p>&mdash; Francesco Papadia (@FrancescoPapad1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrancescoPapad1/statuses/382056234930548736\">September 23, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-523ff5fce4b0e5e2103e161a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-23T08:15:43.717Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Graph: Eurozone recovery gathers pace</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's the graph showing how Europe's private sector is growing at its fastest pace in 27 months (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/23/markets-calm-after-merkels-election-triumph-live#block-523ff49ee4b078484b5fd2cb\">see previous post</a>):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6542308c-4b9b-45e5-9743-70b832a96a06\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/23/1379923642794/5f1a36fc-09b6-45df-ac20-a6825e53e8f5-460x312.png\" alt=\"Eurozone PMI to September 2013\" width=\"460\" height=\"312\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Markit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Markit says it shows the eurozone recovery is 'gathering pace' - with both services sector and manufacturing firms reporting a rise in activity:</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Flash Eurozone Services PMI Activity Index at&#xa0;52.1 (50.7 in August). 27-month high.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022&#xa0;Flash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI(3) at 51.1&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>The revival is being driven by Germany, where activity is growing at its fastest rate since the start of this year (details)</p> <p>although Markit also believes the wider eurozone private sector continues to grow this month:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8820422e-40f1-4f8b-85f1-27e99db91857\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/23/1379924011889/dc2370ee-0a0e-4f30-84c8-ac3e5620cac1-460x319.png\" alt=\"Core vs periphery PMI, September 2013\" width=\"460\" height=\"319\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Markit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And Europe's jobs crisis continues, with another small fall in manufacturing employment. <a href=\"http://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/PressRelease.mvc/7df638bee72d478ca163b5c1c1191887\">The full report is here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-523ff49ee4b078484b5fd2cb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-23T08:04:11.341Z\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone business activity at highest since June 2011</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just in:&#xa0;business activity in the eurozone is growing at its fastest rate in over two years, due to a surge in new orders.</strong></p> <p>That's according to data provider Markit, which reports that its composite purchasing managers index has jumped to its highest level since June 2011.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day - here's a closing summary. \u2022 Angela Merkel has begun the task of forming a new German government, after her Christian Democratic Union party emerged as the clear winner from yesterday's Federal election. Merkel has approached the Social Democrat party, which won the second-largest share of the Bundestag, over possible coalition talks. Merkel herself has achieved a stunning performance. CDU are just 5 seats short of an absolute majority - much better than political analysts had expected. With her former coalition partners, the Free Democrats, crashing out of parliament, Merkel is expected to either form a Grand Coalition with the SPD, or an alliance with the Greens. However, the negotiation process is expected to last for weeks -- with the SPD due to meet on Friday to decide its next move. Its senior leaders warned today that a Grand Coalition was not guaranteed -- it all depends what Merkel can offer. This left the markets on edge, with JP Morgan warning that Merkel faces a 'difficult few weeks'. \u2022 European stock markets all fell, driven by concerns over the German coalition talks and the US Federal Reserve's strategy for easing its bond-buying programme. \u2022 FTSE 100: down 39 points at 6557, -0.6% \u2022 German DAX, down 40 points at 8635, -0.5% \u2022 French CAC: down 31 points at 4172. -0.75% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 68 points at 9109, -0.7% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 56 points at 17913, -0.3% \u2022 Merkel also insisted that her approach to the eurozone crisis would not change, despite seeing the Alternative for Germany party fall narrowly short of the 5% vote threshold to enter parliament. At a sometimes lively press conference (highlights start here), Merkel insisted that Europe's economic reforms need to continue, to make the eurozone more competitive. \u2022 Elsewhere.... Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, said it was too early to say if Greece would need a third bailout next year. Draghi also suggested the ECB could offer eurozone banks more cheap loans this year if needed, which sent the euro down around 0.2% against the US dollar. \u2022 In Greece itself, municipal policemen held a symbolic 'funeral' to mark the thousands of jobs being cut by the Athens government. Photos and report here. \u2022 And there was good-ish economic news for the eurozone, with private sector activity growing at its fastest rate for 27 months. A strong performance by Germany's service sector led the way. French firms also reported a pick-up in activity. However, there was concern that manufacturing output growth in the euro area was slower then expected. Full details start here. Thanks, as ever, for reading and commenting (tech problems permitting). I'll be back tomorrow. Until then, goodnight! GW Glad to report that all the readers' comments are visible again \u2013 sorry again for the interruption. Speaking of the Federal Reserve, William Dudley, the influential head of the New York Fed, has declared that the US central bank stands by its earlier guidance on how, and when, it would slow its $85bn per month bond-buying programme. However, the US economy simply isn't strong enough yet for tapering to begin, Dudley added (thus the Fed's surprise decision last Wednesday not to start tapering the asset purchase scheme). As Dudley put it: The economy has not picked up forward momentum and a 2 per cent growth rate \u2013 even if sustained \u2013 might not be sufficient to generate further improvement in labour market conditions. Mario Draghi declined to give his own view on the German election, as AP's Jurgen Baetz flags up: European stock markets have closed, with major markets all losing ground Investors appear to be mainly worried about when the US Federal Reserve might slow its quantitative easing programme (see 4.21pm). The prospect of lengthy coalition talks in Germany (see 3.32pm) has also hit shares. The German Dax and the French CAC provisionally closed down 0.6%, and the FTSE 100 has fallen 39 points to 6557 (also -0.6%). David Jones of IG explains: Economic data today provided little cheer, with European manufacturing growing at a slower-than-forecast rate. Those of the opinion that stock markets have overshot to the upside in recent months will feel emboldened by the performance in recent days \u2013 if markets can\u2019t hang on to last week's Fed-inspired sharp gains, surely this is a market that has further to fall. Catching up with other news today \u2013 Italy's troubled Monte Paschi bank froze payments on three of its loans today, making its bondholders share some of the pain of its bailout. Bloomberg has the details: Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena said it suspended interest payments on three hybrid notes after European authorities demanded bondholders contribute to the restructuring of the bailed out Italian lender. The world\u2019s oldest bank said in a statement that it won\u2019t pay interest on about \u20ac481m ($650m) of outstanding hybrid notes issued through MPS Capital Trust II and Antonveneta Capital Trusts I and II. Under the terms of the undated notes, the Siena, Italy-based lender is allowed to suspend interest without defaulting and doesn\u2019t have to make up the missed coupons when payments resume. 'In the new world we\u2019re in, bondholders pick up the tab when they can be forced to,' said John Raymond, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. in London. \u201cState aid rules impose losses where possible.\u201d Reuters reckons this shouldn't alarm the markets unduly: Traders and analysts said the coupon freeze had been expected and was largely priced in. MPS's bond prices fell slightly on Monday, one trader said, noting however that volumes were very thin. 'We haven't seen a reaction yet, but frankly if anyone reacts to that with surprise, then they really haven't been paying attention,' said a syndicate banker. Here's CMC Markets' Michael Hewson with an update from the City (pretty much reinforcing what I posted at 4pm) While we now know that Angela Merkel won the German elections over the weekend, such are the idiosyncrasies of the German electoral system that it could well be another two months before we have any idea as to what form the new government will take. Mrs Merkel may have won 41.5% of the vote but she fell short of an overall majority and it seems likely that a coalition with the SPD seems the most probable outcome. This could well be complicated as they are more sympathetic to the idea of a banking union, something that Mrs Merkel has been reluctant to countenance, and any disagreements are likely to complicate the decision making process at a time when key decisions are needed with respect to Greece, and the ESM in the coming months. We\u2019ve also seen some residual softness in European markets as a result of comments last week from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard about the possibility of an October taper as well as concerns over political deadlock surrounding the raising of the debt ceiling and this has translated into further weakness despite some encouraging PMI data from China, while French and German PMI\u2019s were somewhat mixed. Apologies - our comments system seems to be broken. Hopefully a temporary problem -- it's being looked into. The prospect of lengthy coalition negotiations in Germany has helped to push European stock markets down, with the major indices all in the red. The German DAX has fallen almost 0.5%, while the Spanish market is off around 0.8% Here's the details: Not major falls, of course. But at the same time, there is no relief rally at all. Markets don't like uncertainty, and paradoxically Merkel's success - and the failure of the Free Democrats to get into the Bundestag -- has created doubts over Germany's next government. Shares are also down because of confusion over US monetary policy, after the Federal Reserve chose not to start slowing its huge asset-purchasing scheme last week. Last Friday, St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard suggested 'tapering' could begin as soon as October if economic data was strong enough. Other analysts reckon it might not happen until 2014.... Angela Merkel faces a \"difficult few weeks\" as she attempts to pull together a new administration, warns JP Morgan. They reckon there's a 70% chance of a Grand Coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, and a 25% chance of a deal between the CDU and the Greens. They're not totally discounting the idea that CDU might govern alone, although without a Bundestag majority that would be a bold move. JP Morgan said: The process will take some time... The reality is that the SPD\u2019s willingness to engage or not with the CDU will be crucial. By early next week we should have more of a sense of the approach they are likely to take. For now, Gabriel and Steinbruck are playing down the chances of a deal in the near-term. They also suggest that Wolfgang Schauble is likely to remain as finance minister: It is too early to tell precisely what the trade-offs will be in the formation of a new coalition. However, the Chancellor will be in a much stronger position to demand that she keep the finance ministry than we would have expected a week ago. Continuity looks significantly more likely than it once did. This might not please readers in countries hit hard by the eurozone debt crisis, where Schauble is blamed for Europe's austerity push. Here's the full research note. Draghi also surprised the markets by telling MEPs that the ECB is ready to offer the banking sector more help by launching a third round of ultra-cheap loans (or long term refinancing operation) if necessary. That has knocked the euro down to $1.3485, a fall of around one third of a US cent. Back at the European parliament, Mairo Draghi has been asked about whether Greece needs a third bailout. He replied that it's \"premature to ask this\", as the European side of the readjustment for Greece runs until the end of 2014. In our view it's too early to discuss a follow-up programme now, or an extension of the current one. Any decision on further aid would also depend on whether Greece can return to the financial markets by the end of next year, he added. Earlier, Draghi appeared to defend the ECB's role in the Troika -- telling MEPs that while it provided help and advice, the Eurogroup (eurozone finance ministers) takes the decisions. In the long term, Draghi added, the ECB doesn't see itself as part of the troika. This prompted committee chair Sharon Bowles to joke: \"The Eurogroup may or may not accept advice.\" MEP Sylvie Goulard wasn't impressed, comparing the Eurogroup to a group of children who've generated a mess \u2013 it can be hard to know which one is really to blame . Reuters has filed a full story about how Angela Merkel won cheers from the press pack in Berlin, by joking about how she decided what to wear today (as mentioned at 12.55pm) Relishing a thumping election victory for her conservatives in Germany's Sunday election, a smiling Angela Merkel said on Monday that conjecture about looming coalition talks presented her with a dilemma on what to wear. With speculation swirling about her coalition options - which Germans tend to describe in terms of party colours \u2013 a relaxed-looking Merkel told reporters how she had tried to choose a neutral colour for the news conference. \"This morning I stood in front of my wardrobe and I thought red is no good, bright green is no good, blue was yesterday, what are you going to do?\" said Merkel, who wore a dark jacket with a blue-green hue.\"I decided for something very neutral,\" she chuckled, raising a cheer and applause from reporters. The Social Democrats (SPD), with whom she seems most likely to share power, have red as their colour while green represents the Greens who may offer Merkel another coalition option. Her own conservatives' colour is black. Back to the German elections...and the Open Europe thinktank has published a handy guide to the Key Players To Watch in the coalition discussions. As I've suggested already today, the process could be slow \u2026 Little progress is expected before the end of the week, with the SPD holding a small party conference on Friday where it will determine its strategy for the negotiations. Open Europe suggests the Social Democratic Party chairman Sigmar Gabriel could become vice-chancellor if a grand coalition between the CDU and SPD is agreed, or he might get the defence or labour brief. The SPD's leader in the Bundestag, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is likely to become foreign minister. But what if the Greens form a coalition with CDU? It's already in flux, with several senior players offering their resignations today after the party's vote share fell to 8.4%, from 10.7%. Open Europe explains: The party\u2019s chief whip, Volcker Beck, has already announced his resignation while the double party chairmanship, Claudia Roth and Cem \u00d6zdemir, offered their resignation this morning. Both lead candidates, Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckar and J\u00fcrgen Trittin, seem to be dedicated to stay even though internal party pressure is increasing on the latter. Finally, the leader of the Green parliamentary group, Renate K\u00fcnast, would need to be considered among the key players in a potential coalition with the CDU/CSU. What ministerial posts they could or would push for is unclear, but one would assume environmental and energy related posts would be top of the list More here: As focus shifts to German coalition negotiations, who are the key players to watch? Mario Draghi's full statement the European Parliament is online here. Heads-up: Mario Draghi is testifying at the European parliament's committee on economic and monetary affairs (livestream here) He's starting by reading out a statement, largely reiterating what the ECB said at its monthly meeting at the start of this month. inflation is still subdued, credit conditions are still poor, the eurozone economy remains weak (although now recovering) \u2026 America's manufacturing sector is expanding at a slower pace this month, according to data released a few minutes ago. Markit's \"flash\" manufacturing PMI came in at a three-month low of 52.8 \u2013 mirroring the slower growth reported in Germany and France this morning. There have been extraordinary scenes in Greece this morning, where police officers held a symbolic funeral for the municipal police service that's being closed as part of the government's austerity cuts. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports that municipal policemen and other public sector workers took to the streets to protest job dismissals today. She writes: At the start of a second week of intense industrial action in the public sector, Greek municipal police took drama to another level this morning, holding a mock funeral in the centre of Athens to protest internationally mandated cuts that have marked the death of the sector. Hundreds of black clad protestors marched solemnly behind a hearse carrying a coffin before opening the casket outside the administrative reform ministry and dumping uniforms once worn by municipal police into it. The images, captured on TV, appeared to take even hardened program presenters by surprise. Under pressure from its troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF, the government announced the disbandment of the force two months ago saying staff would be redeployed into a mobility scheme on reduced pay. Protestors denounced the scheme as a euphemism for jobs cuts in a nation which, with about 1.4 million out of work, has already been hit by explosive levels of unemployment. \u201cA lot of us have no one working in our families. This is insane,\u201d said one protestor standing outside the reform ministry, the government department in charge of implementing public sector cuts. Meanwhile teachers, who have also thrown their weight behind a second week of strikes, demonstrated outside the education ministry where they have draped banners denouncing the dismissals and promising to \u201coverturn\u201d the deeply unpopular policies. These protests could escalate tomorrow when ADEDY, the civil servants union, begins another 48-hour work stoppage. All this comes as the Troika continue to conduct their audit of the Greek finances (see 8.57am) Interesting \u2026 Social Democrats' chairman, Sigmar Gabriel, has declared that there's \"nothing automatic\" about forming a coalition with the Christian Democrats. The comments come after Angela Merkel told reporters that she'd contacted Gabriel to begin coalition talks with the SPD (see 12.44pm for the details). Here's the Reuters newflash: 23-Sep-2013 13:07 - GERMAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATS' CHAIRMAN SAYS NOTHING AUTOMATIC ABOUT COALITION WITH CONSERVATIVES, UP TO MERKEL TO FORM A MAJORITY The SPD's losing candidate for the chancellorship, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, has also insisted that the ball is in Merkel's court. He added that the issue of eurozone banking union (where Merkel's government has taken a slow approach), must be part of any coalition talks. Merkel also expressed \"sincere respect\" to the Irish people for what's been achieved since the financial crisis struck. Prime minister Enda Kenny has shown a passionate commitment to reforms, she added. When not slapping down impudent questions about her fashion sense, Angela Merkel also reiterated that her commitment to tough reforms in other parts of Europe has not weakened. Asked about the Irish bailout, chancellor Merkel said Ireland was an example of a country where conditions are improving (it exited recession last week). Its progress, though, was based on people recognising the mistakes of the past: Chancellor Merkel caused much amusement among the press pack in Berlin when she was asked if there was any symbolism in her outfit at today's press conference. Does the choice of a blue-greenish teal jacket suggest an imminent coalition alliance with the Greens? Not at all, insists Merkel (already famous for her wide range of coloured jackets). She jokes that she stood at the wardrobe this morning, thinking: Red doesn't go, green doesn't go, blue was yesterday. So she chose a \"neutral\" colour instead. Angela Merkel appears to be on top form at her post-victory press conference \u2013 neatly avoiding a question from one hack about whether Europe needs a Marshall plan to stimulate a recovery. Ok, here's the key quotes from Angela Merkel about her coalition plans (via Reuters' Berlin office) We conservatives have a clear mandate to form a government and Germany needs a stable government, so we will carry out this mandate We are, of course, open for talks and I have already had initial contact with the SPD chairman* who said the SPD must first hold a meeting of its leaders on Friday. * That's Sigmar Gabriel (rather than Peer Steinbruck, who was the SPD challenger for the chancellorship). Merkel says she wants to study the reasons for the rise in support for the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, but won't change CDU policy on Europe in response. The election result is a strong vote for a united Europe, says Angela Merkel as her post-victory press conference continues. The chancellor also underlines that there will be no let-up in Europe's economic strategy. We are not at the end of the reform process in Europe, she declares. Europe must become more competitive. Merkel also indicates that her CDU-CSU party will not govern alone, saying wants a \"stable\" government to run Germany for the next four years. Angela Merkel had told reporters that she has opened coalition talks, by making her first contact with the chairman of the Social Democrats (who came second to the CDU with 192 seats). This does not exclude talks with other parties, she adds (such as the Greens, who came third with 63 seats, I imagine). On Europe, she says that Germany's current policy is \"integration friendly\", and she sees no need to change it. More to follow \u2026 ECB president Mario Draghi has flown to Brussels today for an appearance at the European parliament. Chiara De Felice, ANSA's EU correspondent, reports that Draghi's first priority was to catch up with the latest Italian sports news. Suggests he's not worried about the German election. Heads-up: Angela Merkel is giving a press conference now. Let's see what she says about coalition plans..... Spain's tourism industry has notched up its busiest August ever, offering hope to one of the eurozone's most hard-pressed members. A record 8.3 million holidaymakers from abroad visited Spain last month, a 7.1% increase on the same month last year. It appears that this was partly owing to people avoiding unrest in Egypt and Turkey. Total visitor numbers are up 4.5% this year, suggesting Spain's on track to beat 2012's record number of visitors. The number of French visitors jumped by 9% to 1.8 million. while Russian tourist numbers jumped by 30% to 1.1 million (according to Reuters). As the image above shows, Angela Merkel's election dominated the Spanish papers today. This video clip, from the Wall Street Journal, shows the scene at Germany's various party headquarters last night as the election results came in. There's a wide spectrum of emotion \u2013 from jubilation at CDU HQ to open-mouthed shock at the Free Democrats bash. Peter Schaffrik, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, explains that the stock markets are subdued today because it could take weeks to agree a new German coalition. He warned: The formation of a government is not straightforward at all. If finding a new government takes too long, markets might get jumpy as regards the stability of the German government, particularly with key European issues coming up for a negotiation. The Bundesbank has predicted this morning that the German economy is on track for further growth in the months ahead, although the pace of expansion may have faltered this quarter. Germany's central bank said growth in the third quarter of 2013 would not match the previous three months, but still sounded fairly upbeat in its new monthly report. Here's a flavour: A noticeable improvement in expectations for production and exports as well as a slow increase in incoming orders point to growth in coming months The extraordinarily good consumer sentiment continues, supported by slowing inflation and an overall good situation on the labour market. Here's some more analyst reaction to the German election results (see 9.49am for Saxo's early take). Jonathan Pryor of Investec Corporate Treasury: The significance for the euro of Merkel being re-elected is that currency markets are generally quite precious when it comes to political change so a third term for Merkel is likely to be euro positive. The fact that her party will also be forced to enter into a coalition should be received well by markets considering that it\u2019s likely, left to their own devices, the Conservative party would yield a firm austerity first view to the peripheral member states. Steven Englander of Citigroup: This is a vote in favour of Merkel rather than a vote in favour of big changes It's most likely Merkel will govern in a grand coalition with the Social Democrats, so that's a slight euro positive because the government would be somewhat more friendly to the peripheral nations in the currency bloc. Barclays: Chancellor Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU won about 42% of the vote in the federal elections, according to the latest estimates, but a poor showing by the FDP means a CDU/CSU/SPD \u201cgrand\u201d coalition of the largest parties looks the most likely outcome, providing limited near-term implications for markets \u2026 We do not expect much change from Merkel's current stance and continued support for weaker euro area member states. The relatively strong showing of the euro-critical AfD, however, is likely to limit the room for any new financial concessions from the next German government. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale: Angela Merkel won a resounding endorsement of her policies from the German voters, with the highest share of votes for the CDU since 1990, but she didn't win enough to avoid a painful period of coalition-building and uncertainty. The outcome leaves markets somewhat in limbo. Monex Capital Markets: Critically, the future shape of Germany's government will dictate how the eurozone works through its problems. Anything that is seen to deviate too far from the harsh austerity measures of recent years could inject a degree of fear, not just in Europe but in markets worldwide. And here's some more media reaction: Forgot to mention earlier, but China's manufacturing activity has hit its highest level since March, bolstering hopes that its economy is performing well this month. China's manufacturing activity hits six-month high. Although Alternative For Germany (AfD) didn't quite hit the major 5% mark to win Bundestag seats, the eurosceptic party still made a pretty decent impact in the election. In the Financial Times, Peter Spiegel reckons AfD could still influence Angela Merkel's thinking over Europe: The future of AfD Although it failed to reach the 5 per cent threshold to get into the Bundestag \u2013 it ended up with 4.696 per cent of the vote \u2013 the anti-euro Alternative for Germany party (known by its German initials AfD) surprised many in Brussels by getting as close as it did. It was once conventional wisdom that no anti-Europe party could attract significant support in Germany, but if AfD is able to use this result as a base to grow, it could force Ms Merkel to keep an eye over her shoulder as she gets into bed with the SPD. Exit polls show that AfD drew most heavily from disaffected FDP voters, assuaging some of the fears within the CDU that they would pull voters away from them. But if the AfD emerges as the alternative conservative force in Germany amid the rubble of the FDP, that could shape the way Ms Merkel approaches Brussels. More here: What does the German result mean for the EU? Interestingly, AfD appears to have won support from across the political spectrum. This chart, via Alberto Nardelli, shows how it won 330,000 from the Free Democrats (helping to drive them out of the Bundestag) and 230,000 from the Green party: The news that eurozone private sector output hit a 27-month high this month has pushed stock markets a little higher this morning (see above), led by the French CAC. The euro is flat at $1.314 to the US dollar. There's still no real relief that Angela Merkel secured such a strong result, particularly as we don't know whether she'll hammer out a credible coalition. John Hardy, head of FX Strategy at Saxo Bank, suggests that a Grand Coalition with the SPD might lead to further tensions over eurozone strategy, and prevent rapid progress on issues like banking union and closer political ties. Hardy writes: Germany\u2019s election was good for Angela Merkel, but leaves Europe and the euro in extreme state of uncertainty. Merkel\u2019s landslide victory comes with a twist as much of her party\u2019s strength was due to voters abandoning ship from the coalition partner FDP. Thus, the election result leaves Merkel in need of forming an awkward coalition with either the SPD or the Greens. The storyline goes that one of these coalitions will be more \u201cEU friendly\u201d as the parties to the left tend to lean toward more generosity toward the EU project than Merkel. But even a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d with the SPD if likely to be anything but grand and the greater risk from here is that Germany\u2019s leadership in Europe risks being as weak as Merkel\u2019s victory in the elections was strong. That\u2019s at least in part because every EU-related decision in Germany will be a nervous exercise in calculating the effects of domestic politics within an uncomfortable coalition. From here, Merkel is likely to try to continue the approach that has brought her relative success so far, making small concessions here and there, such as a small third bailout in Greece, to stem the risk that any individual crisis triggers a wider contagion. What we won\u2019t see is a new overall vision for Europe. The on-going Big Question for Europe is the fundamental tension that will tear Europe apart if it is not eventually addressed: the single currency and single central bank within a multiple-sovereign union. The EU is a house without a foundation, and such a house can\u2019t stand forever. And a new Merkel-led coalition will not put Germany on a path toward building that foundation, it will merely see Germany continuing to send out the repairmen to plaster over the cracks that are appearing in the walls as the house continues to destabilize. Francesco Papadia, who used to run market operations for the European Central Bank, believes the German election results could be good news for the eurozone. He tweets that Angel Merkel will no longer be 'captive' to right-wing views, should she form a grand coalition with the Social Democrats: Here's the graph showing how Europe's private sector is growing at its fastest pace in 27 months (see previous post): Markit says it shows the eurozone recovery is 'gathering pace' - with both services sector and manufacturing firms reporting a rise in activity: \u2022 Flash Eurozone Services PMI Activity Index at 52.1 (50.7 in August). 27-month high. \u2022 Flash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI(3) at 51.1 The revival is being driven by Germany, where activity is growing at its fastest rate since the start of this year (details) although Markit also believes the wider eurozone private sector continues to grow this month: And Europe's jobs crisis continues, with another small fall in manufacturing employment. The full report is here. Just in: business activity in the eurozone is growing at its fastest rate in over two years, due to a surge in new orders. That's according to data provider Markit, which reports that its composite purchasing managers index has jumped to its highest level since June 2011. It hit 52.1 this month, up from August's 51.5 (anything over 50=growth). This follows the better than expected data from France (8.25am) and Germany (see 8.39am) this morning, which showed a service sector revival. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the data is very encouraging: These surveys show a real underlying swell of improvement. It\u2019s all looking very positive. More to follow.... While Germany was gripped by election fever, the Greek government was beginning a new round of talks with its lenders. Troika officials are in Athens to assess whether Greece's financial aid programe is on track. Overshadowing the talks is the question of whether Greece will get a third bailout in 2014. The Wall Street Journal has a good take: After a meeting lasting almost four hours with senior officials from the European commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank\u2013 known locally as the troika \u2013 and the Greek finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, a senior finance ministry official said initial discussions focused on a broad range of issues including the execution of the 2013 budget. 'We will continue to work through the week,' said the official. While the negotiations represent the latest round in the regular quarterly inspection visits that have accompanied Greece's almost four-year-long debt crisis \u2013 and will decide on whether to unlock the country's next aid tranche of \u20ac1bn ($1.35bn) \u2013 new budget and growth data also show Greece may be turning a corner. Senior officials in Athens have spoken of gradually exiting the draconian austerity program tied to the bailouts, but they also warn that the turnaround has yet to be felt by the average Greek, and that extremism in the country is rising. More here: Greece, Creditors Begin Talks on New Bailout Meanwhile, Greek journalist Kostas Karkagiannis sums up the mood: Here's a nice montage of how German newspapers are reporting Angela Merkel's success, via the invaluable Electionista The key point from this morning's French and German economic data could be that manufacturing output in both countries was weaker than expected. Here's some instant reaction: German service sector companies, like the country's chancellor, are enjoying a pretty successful September. Activity has reached its highest levels since the start of this year. The monthly 'flash' survey of purchasing managers, just released, showed firms in Europe's largest economy reporting stronger growth this month. This pushed the German PMI up to 53.8, up from August's 53.5, and the best reading since January. As in France (see last post) the service sector led the way: \u2022 Flash Germany Services Activity Index at 54.4 (52.8 in August), 7-month high. \u2022 Flash Germany Manufacturing PMI(3) at 51.3 (51.8 in August), 2-month low. It indicates that Germany's economy is continuing to expand this quarter, despite problems elsewhere in the euro area. A key factor in Angela Merkel's victory last night. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, suggested Germany could pull weaker neighbours forwards: Germany\u2019s economy remained firmly in recovery mode during September, and its strengthening performance should continue to reverberate across the euro area. Positive signs from the German economy are a crucial factor underpinning global business confidence at present, especially while some momentum has been lost across emerging markets. German manufacturing and services output both rose again on the back of improved new business levels during September. Encouraging economic news from France this morning \u2013 its private sector has returned to growth this month for the first time since February 2012. The monthly 'flash' PMI (a survey of purchasing managers across the country) came in at a 19-month high 50.2 \u2013 up from August's 48.8. That's the first time it's been above the 50-mark, which indicates growth, since the early months of last year. (reminder, we get German PMI data in a few minutes) Markit, which conducts the research, said French industry appears to have stabilised this month thanks to its service sector, where growth was a 20-month high. However, manufacturing output did fall slightly (to 49.5, worse than expected). Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, explained: The latest Flash PMI data point to stabilising business conditions in France during September. A return to expansion for the service sector counterbalanced a weaker manufacturing performance, but new business trends were broadly flat across both sectors. Employment also moved closer to stabilisation, which should help the economy remain on a firmer footing. As expected, there's no sign of a Merkel rally in Europe's stock markets after her historic election win over night. In Frankfurt, the DAX index is up a measly 0.1%, as is the French CAC in Paris. In London, the FTSE fell 8 points at 6592. Traders may be waiting to see how the coalition negotiations progress, and there's talk that Merkel might struggle to strike a deal with the Social Democrats. Via FT Alphaville: As JP Morgan\u2019s Alex White said, 'One can hardly escape the fact that Merkel\u2019s coalition partners in her last two terms lost double digit shares of the vote.' Merkel's win also means that the eurozone crisis may flare up again this autumn, as Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, points out: With the election behind us, prepare for revival of discussions on tough eurozone issues put on hold for the summer. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research agrees: Angela Merkel's election success made the front page of the Guardian today: Here's our full story of the German election: Merkel secures third election win And if you missed the action, my colleague Mark Rice-Oxley live-blogged it all here: Germany election results - live updates Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, writes that Angela Merkel's triumph is her reward for protecting German's from the effects of the euro crisis: Her victory demonstrates the gulf between Germany and the rest of the EU and the eurozone, although it is not clear what impact her third term will have on the direction of the crisis. Merkel's second term coincided exactly with the euro crisis. As she was forming her coalition with the Free Democrats (FDP) in October 2009, Greece went belly-up, prompting deep doubts about the euro and the survival of the EU. She has been resented and criticised across Europe for her crisis management and responses. Berlin became alarmed at the resurrection of the \"ugly German\" stereotype in neighbouring countries. But German voters have voiced their approval. More here: Angela Merkel's election win is reward for weathering the euro crisis at home Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. What a triumph for Angela Merkel, eh? Germany's chancellor stormed to a third term last night, leading the Christian Democrats to their best election result in two decades. The CDU-CSU alliance have scooped 311 seats out of 630, just five seats short of an overall majority. At one stage last night it looked like Merkel might win enough seats to govern alone. Instead, she will now start coalition talks with her rival parties -- but not her old partners, the Free Democrats, who have been dramatically ousted from the Bundestag after failing to win 5% of the vote. That 5% threshold proved a stretch too far for the new eurosceptic force in German politics, Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, on an impressive debut performance. Forming a coalition with one of her left-wing rival could be tricky for Merkel, who admitted last night that \"Maybe we won't find anyone who wants to do anything with us\". A grand coalition with the SPD (192 votes) is a possibility -- but could take some time to hammer out (as in 2005, when coalition talks took two months). The SDP could demand some serious concessions from Merkel, including possibly new finance minister. As Reuters sums up: During the campaign, the center-left party argued for a minimum wage and higher taxes on the wealthy -- both opposed by Merkel. The party could also demand the finance ministry, pushing out respected 71-year-old incumbent Wolfgang Schaeuble. Don't expect a decision imminently, though. And this uncertainty over Germany's next government means there will be no relief rally in Europe's financial markets, where the euro has inched a little higher this morning to \u20ac1.354. The German DAX might rise a few points this morning , but other markets are expect to fall (the FTSE is being called down 15 points by IG). From the City, Michael Hewson writes: The likely outcome [for Merkel] looks set to be a grand coalition with the SPD. In any event her old coalition partners the FDP appear to have missed out badly, with the new euro sceptic party Alternative for Deutschland, the AfD, doing particularly well, coming in as it did from a standing start. Whatever the look of any government that is formed, and this might take several days, one of the key factors that did come out of the campaign was the increasing opposition of a rising number of German voters to further bailouts of what they perceive as fiscally irresponsible peripheral European economies. Any new government that chooses to ignore this rising scepticism in subsequent months is likely to come unstuck at the ballot box in any new state or European elections. And speaking of bailouts, Greece's \"Troika\" of lenders returned to the country yesterday to start a new assessment of its financial programme. New public sector strikes have been called for later this week -- putting more pressure on the Athens government. We also get new survey data this morning which will show how Germany and France's manufacturing and service sectors are performing this month. I'll be tracking all the action through the day as usual....",

      "bodyText": "A Swiss village has voted to donate 110,000 Swiss francs (\u00a375,000) of taxes paid by Ivan Glasenberg, the billionaire chief executive of GlencoreXstrata, to charities in countries where the London-listed mining and commodity trading company is accused of exploiting people and resources. The people of Hedingen, a village near Zurich, voted 764 to 662 in favour of donating the money in a \"clear sign of solidarity with those suffering the consequences of the extraction of raw materials\". The village will donate 10% of the \"commodity million\" Swiss francs it received out of taxes paid by Glasenberg in relation to Glencore's flotation in London in 2011. Samuel Schweizer, a member of the citizens' committee that proposed the donation, said the villagers felt obliged to give back some of the \"extraordinary wealth to the people who should have received it in the beginning\". He added: \"It is extraordinary that our small community got more than 1 million francs of extra tax money from Glencore extracting raw materials in a number of very poor countries, where it is accused of polluting, abusing labour and not paying much in taxes. We had a unique opportunity to raise public awareness. We felt we must share this with the people who are suffering from the operations of Glencore.\" The money will be paid to non-governmental organisations working on humanitarian projects in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Colombia and Bolivia. Glasenberg, who is worth $6.7bn according to Forbes magazine, paid 360m Swiss francs (\u00a3246m) in taxes linked to the flotation to the village of R\u00fcschlikon, where he lives, in 2011. The money has since been redistributed between R\u00fcschlikon, Hedingen and other communities in the Canton of Zurich. Five of the villages are following Hedingen's lead and voting on whether to donate the money to charity over the next three months. Schweizer said pressure is building on R\u00fcschlikon, which kept 50m Swiss francs of Glasenberg's taxes, to donate some of the money to charity. Residents of R\u00fcschlikon, already dubbed \"the richest village in Switzerland\", last year voted down a motion to give some of the money to an African charity. Instead villagers voted to cut the local tax rate by 7%. Schweizer added that if other villages follow Hedingen's lead, R\u00fcschlikon \"will be pressured into reconsidering its decision\". \"We wish that R\u00fcschlikon would act in the same way [as Hedingen]. \"We hope that people will open their eyes to the danger that raw material extraction will be the next reputational time bomb for Switzerland,\" he said. \"Political leaders have not learned anything from the disaster of [Switzerland's role at the heart of the] banking industry.\" The Berne Declaration, a non-governmental organisation campaigning against Switzerland's role in hosting global commodity companies, said: \"While the decision makers in the capital Berne consider our commodities industry still only a political reputation risk, the landmark decision in the rural-conservative Hedingen shows that on the ground Glencore and their competitors already have a real reputational problem in this country. \"Remarkably and correctly, the people of Hedingen assume that tax money is not automatically white, clean or legitimate.

    "webTitle": "Bureaucratic UK visa regime harming trade with China, says Willie Walsh", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Trade with China has been harmed by a British visa regime that makes foreign businessmen and visitors feel unwelcome, the UK's leading airline executive has claimed. Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways's parent company International Airlines Group, said the level of trade was \"significantly behind\" its potential. Speaking on the inaugural flight of BA's direct service to Chengdu, the rapidly expanding capital of Sichuan province, Walsh said: \"We need a visa regime that is less bureaucratic. People need to feel that the UK is actually welcoming. There is a perception in China that the UK doesn't want to see Chinese tourists or business. We need to put a bit of effort into changing that. \"The government talks a good talk about wanting to do business in China, but if they're going to translate that into real opportunity they're going to have to look more closely at the visa issue.\" He said that air passenger duty, the British aviation tax that adds \u00a383 to the cost of an economy flight to China, and visa fees were \"a real deterrent\" to visitors. Walsh said limited slots at Heathrow airport had been one factor that had slowed BA's expansion into China, but said visas were \"without question a problem for us\", and claimed that they would have launched the direct Chengdu service a year ago had problems been ironed out. While Walsh said there had been improvements in the regime, he contrasted the \u00a356 price of a visa for the Schengen area of EU countries \u2013 where passport and immigration controls have been abolished \u2013 with the \u00a380 it costs a Chinese visitor to enter the UK alone. The market was also more difficult for airlines at Heathrow compared with those at other European hubs where visas for transfer passengers are not required, he said. He warned that it meant that Chinese visitors, the fastest growing sector of global travellers, were \"bypassing\" the UK, and said Britain would need to work harder to attract them. \"We'll need to have more people who speak Chinese and Mandarin. We're losing out on the organised tour groups. It does embarrass me that we don't make more effort.\" Walsh said that while China was the eighth biggest export market for the UK, \"it's still significantly behind where it could be, when you look at China in terms of its principal imports. There is an opportunity for a lot more trade.\" BA is hoping to tap into a growing business and leisure market at Chengdu, China's fourth-largest city with a population of 14 million and a large financial, electronics and manufacturing base, whose airport has seen passenger numbers grow from 5.5 million to 32 million in the last 12 years. Advocates of Heathrow expansion have frequently cited Chengdu as an example of a destination inadequately linked to Britain due to capacity constraints. Walsh said he did not expect politicians to act on the Airports Commission's impending report on airport capacity, and he criticised David Cameron and George Osborne for a lack of vision. While he said that economic recovery could be seen in London, he queried if it existed beyond the capital. \"If I was Osborne I certainly wouldn't be popping the champagne corks at this stage. \"I haven't seen much evidence of visionary leadership there. To me, they respond to whatever's topical rather than setting out a long-term plan and a long-term vision for growth in the UK economy.\"",

In September last year, when Fitch downgraded Queensland\u2019s credit rating from AA+ to AA, the yields on Queensland Treasury Corporation (QTC) bonds fell in the following quarter.</p> <p>The yields are now higher, but this is mostly because state government bonds follow the value of Australian government\u2019s bonds. And in the past year, the yield on Australian government bonds has risen \u2013 albeit from record lows.</p> <p>And, similarly, Australia\u2019s bond yields follow the yields on bonds of the major economies in the world, such as the USA, UK and Germany, whose yields have also increased in the past year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8a6890b3-2b49-449e-9a80-381426db2cf6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/23/1379904365218/5123cc2a-14c0-4d83-8d43-02055f14c7fb-460x316.png\" alt=\"Global 10-year government bonds\" width=\"460\" height=\"316\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Global 10-year government bond yields.

Thus a downgrading of a state\u2019s credit rating would logically see the spread between its yield and that of Australian government bonds increase \u2013 because notionally that state has become a riskier place to invest.

      "bodyText": "The decision last week by credit agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s to downgrade Western Australia\u2019s credit rating from AAA to AA+ highlighted the difficulty of managing the economy and pleasing the ratings agencies. The downgrade reflected Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s view that the Western Australian government was not as committed to paying off debt as the WA premier, Colin Barnett, would have everyone believe. In its statement, the ratings agency noted: \u201c... while the fiscal action plan announced in WA\u2019s fiscal 2014 budget improves the state\u2019s path, in our view there is likely to be slippage, reflecting our view of limited political will as evidenced by the early revision of some budget revenue and expenditure measures.\u201d The key term is \u201cpolitical will\u201d and reflects that, while talking the talk of cutting spending and returning to surplus is rather easy, actually doing it is tough. The main consequence of the downgrade is that, notionally, it will make raising money for the WA government more expensive as investors may now demand a higher interest rate (or bond yield) on WA government bonds. The main purpose of ratings agencies is to let investors know the relative risk of governments\u2019 and companies\u2019 bonds. It doesn\u2019t always follow, however, that a ratings downgrade will mean the yield a government pays for its bonds will go up. In September last year, when Fitch downgraded Queensland\u2019s credit rating from AA+ to AA, the yields on Queensland Treasury Corporation (QTC) bonds fell in the following quarter. The yields are now higher, but this is mostly because state government bonds follow the value of Australian government\u2019s bonds. And in the past year, the yield on Australian government bonds has risen \u2013 albeit from record lows. And, similarly, Australia\u2019s bond yields follow the yields on bonds of the major economies in the world, such as the USA, UK and Germany, whose yields have also increased in the past year. The important thing about bond yields is as much the difference (or spread) between yields as their nominal rate. Thus a downgrading of a state\u2019s credit rating would logically see the spread between its yield and that of Australian government bonds increase \u2013 because notionally that state has become a riskier place to invest. This is in some ways a better way of measuring the cost of raising debt because it explains the extra amount a state government has to pay compared with both other states and the federal government. A state government will always have to charge higher interest than the federal government; the issue is by how much. However, the spread doesn\u2019t always increase when a credit downgrade occurs. In the past 12 months the spread of QTC 10-year bond yields to Australian government bonds has actually shrunk. The downgrade in WA does, however, highlight not only that keeping a triple-A rating is tough, but that tougher still is doing it without wrecking your economy. The ALP was right during the election to boast that under its watch, and for the first time, the three major ratings agencies \u2013 Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s and Fitch \u2013 rated Australia as AAA. Given the collapse in revenue experienced after the GFC, it took some pretty tough spending cuts and tax increases to achieve the balance of keeping the ratings agencies happy and not sending the economy into an austerity-driven tailspin. As it is, the cuts made in the 2012-13 budget came at a time when unemployment was rising and growth stalling. It was a bold decision by Wayne Swan, one which received little credit from those who believe governments should cut spending in tough times, and less from those who believe the opposite. Little wonder he was never able to sell his achievement. But while you can argue whether it was good for the economy for Swan to attempt to return the budget to surplus so quickly, it is clear that since Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s downgrading of the USA\u2019s credit rating to AA+ in August 2011, and Fitch\u2019s upgrading of Australia\u2019s credit rating to AAA two months later, the spread between Australian and US bond yields has declined appreciably. Australia is now one of only 11 countries with a triple-A rating from all three agencies, and of those 11, Australia\u2019s growth in the past 12 months is second only to Singapore\u2019s. So it is pretty obvious that Australia, to this point, has achieved the balance of economic performance and fiscal responsibility better than just about everyone. It\u2019s a tough balance though. And thus far, Colin Barnett appears a bit flummoxed about what to do in WA. He explained the increase in state debt in quite sensible terms: \u201cDebt is high and rising. Why? Because this state is growing.

Credit agencies are concerned primarily with the budget, not the actual economic situation of the state. If slashing spending and selling off valuable assets helps lower the state\u2019s debt then the ratings agency will be happy, regardless of what that might do to the Western Australian economy.
