    "webTitle": "Royal Mail privatisation will not affect postal delivery \u2013 Vince Cable", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Royal Mail's duty to deliver to all 29m homes in the UK will survive privatisation, the government has said, as it unveiled plans for the most significant state sell-off since the railways in the 1990s . The pledge came as business secretary Vince Cable announced long-awaited plans to float the Royal Mail on the London Stock Exchange this year, and confirmed that postmen and women would be entitled to free shares in the business. Critics argued that the privatisation of an institution first opened to the public 378 years ago would mean post office closures, the erosion of six-day delivery in rural areas and worse pay and conditions for postal workers. Speaking in the House of Commons, Cable said privatisation was \"an irreversible course\" that would secure the future of Royal Mail in the face of competition. \"The government's decision on the sale is practical, it is logical, it is a commercial decision designed to put Royal Mail's future on a long-term sustainable business. It is consistent with developments elsewhere in Europe where privatised operators in Austria, Germany and Belgium produce profit margins far higher than the Royal Mail but have continued to provide high-quality and expanding services,\" he said. \"Now the time has come for government to step back from Royal Mail, and allow its management to focus wholeheartedly on growing the business.\" The Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents two-thirds of the Royal Mail's 150,000 workforce, vowed to fight the sell-off and accused the government of ignoring the views of the public. The Labour party, which attempted to part-privatise the service in 2009, accused ministers of pushing ahead with the sale to dig the chancellor out of a financial hole caused by a rise in government borrowing. Market analysts expect Royal Mail will be valued at \u00a33bn when it floats later this year. The public will be able to apply for shares, although Royal Mail workers will be allowed first in the queue if they want extra shares on top of the 10% share guaranteed to them. Cable said the \"overarching objective\" of privatisation was to secure the universal service obligation that requires mail deliveries to any UK home six days a week, which has been threatened by a slump in profits in the wake of a 25% decline in letters over the last decade. But Dave Ward, the CWU's deputy general secretary, said the business secretary was \"off the pace\" on the economic reality of the six-day universal service, which he predicted would not survive in rural areas and remote regions under privatisation. Warning that privately-owned companies will seek a relaxation of the obligation if they offer their own doorstep delivery services around the UK, he said: \"We are talking about an economic reality. These [delivery] companies will lobby against the six-day service. It simply will not make the money to secure their investment.\" The national network of 11,780 Post Offices, a separate company from Royal Mail, will remain in public hands, a promise that failed to reassure the National Federation of SubPostmasters', who accused the government of taking \"a reckless gamble\" with the network that would lead to post office closures. \"If privatisation goes ahead, we have very real fears that the Royal Mail will rip up its the current agreement with Post Office Ltd [to provide Royal Mail products and services] in an aggressive bid to maximise profits for its shareholders,\" said NFSP general secretary George Thomson. Chuka Umunna, shadow business minister, said the recent doubling in profits at Royal Mail to \u00a3403m also called into question the assumptions behind the \"fire sale\". \"They now want to privatise the profits at the time it is making money. How can this policy make sense?\" Cable pledged that private ownership would not trigger any change in post office workers' terms and conditions, while the Royal Mail promised \"a legally-binding and enforceable contract with the CWU\" to enshrine these rights. Dave Ward at the CWU said Cable's guarantees \"are not worth the paper they are written on\", while existing agreements with were \"completely inadequate\". Strike action was inevitable, he said.But the government hopes that giving away shares to employees \u2013 the largest worker share offer in nearly 30 years \u2013 will soften opposition to the sale. Under the scheme, eligible employees would be entitled to free shares, but would be unable to sell them for at least three years. Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, who has been courting potential investors in the UK, North America and continental Europe, said the sale would give employees \"a meaningful stake in the company\" and the public \"the opportunity to invest in a great British institution\".

      "bodyText": "The boss of Britain's second biggest housebuilder has said Britain's housing crisis can only be overcome if the public sector releases land for new developments. The Ministry of Defence, local authorities and hundreds of other public bodies own up to 35% of the land ready for development, said Barratt Development's Mark Clare, and only when they agree to sell can a building boom get under way. The call came as economists at PwC predicted that despite recent signs of an upturn in the housing market, it could take until 2021 for average prices to return to their pre-crisis peak, once the effects of high inflation are taken into account. PwC believes it is likely to be another seven years before inflation-adjusted prices catch up despite a return to house price growth that could bring the average cost of a home back to 2007 levels in cash terms by the end of next year. Chief economist John Hawksworth believes prices will not take off because getting a foot on the property ladder still remains impossible for many. Even if economic growth is stronger than the 1% in 2013 and 2% in 2014 that PwC is forecasting, it would still take until 2017 for house prices to bounce back from their current level of 18% below the peak in real terms. PwC warns that a weaker-than-expected recovery could see another decade of real-terms stagnation. Barratt, which said the underlying prices of its homes were flat year on year, is expecting to increase the number of homes it builds from 13,600 in the last year to 16,000 by 2015 and has invested \u00a33bn in land for development.

Government figures show the number of homes built in the year to March in England was 108,190, down 8% on the year before and 49% below their peak in 2007. Private housebuilders have accounted for a growing proportion of the homes built in Britain in recent months following the government's Funding For Lending scheme, which cut the cost of borrowing and Help to Buy programme, which supports house building with loans that can be used for a deposit. Industry figures for May show 9,617 homes were completed in the private sector, the highest monthly figure for five years, while less than half that figure were registered in the public sector. Clare said there was no doubt the market was stronger amid improving consumer sentiment, greater mortgage finance availability and the Help to Buy scheme. His comments echoed those made by fellow UK housebuilders in recent days, as well as better economic data, which have signalled rising house prices and market activity. The firm said in a trading update for the year to 30 June that profit before tax and exceptional items is expected to be \u00a3192m, up 73% and beating the top end of analysts' expectations. Sales at Barratt have increased by 34.7% since Help to Buy was launched in April, and the company completed 13,663 homes in the full year, up 6.3%. The strong performance spilled over into the new year, with forward sales up 53.6% at \u00a3829.7m at 30 June.

      "body": "<p>For most people in the US, Wall Street is not an everyday concept. It's more like a haunted Victorian mansion on the edge of town where your 401(k) retirement plan lives: it takes a long time to understand how to get there and you're pretty sure something's not right about it, but you're too scared to get close enough to check.</p> <p>As you might expect, that's an illusion. Wall Street is in your backyard, where electrical lines give you light for your house: those energy companies raise money by selling bonds through the public markets. Wall Street is in your pipes, where water managed by municipal governments travels from reservoirs to your faucets; your city likely funds its sewers and water lines by selling bonds in auctions to big, billion-dollar investors. Wall Street is in your schools and roads (paid for by more bonds) and in your colleges (which invest your tuition money in everything from stocks to farmland, in the hopes of boosting their profits and their budgets). </p> <p>Wall Street is in your bank account, charging you fees on your checking account; it's in your driveway, where your car sleeps as you pay off your auto loan \u2013 a debt that has already been sliced and diced and sold to a trader at a bank somewhere. Wall Street is in your house \u2013 which it <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323300004578555141517583344.html\">probably owns a part of</a> \u2013 and because the interest rate on your mortgage bill was <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/easy-street/libor-mortals-easy-explainer\">likely set by 18 traders in London</a> one day a few years back.</p> <p>As a result, Wall Street is not so much like a haunted Victorian mansion as a quiet, creeping fungus right where you live: it grows fast and takes root everywhere, silently.</p> <p>But this has not been enough: even with all the ways Wall Street surrounds us, most of us never think about it. We think about our kids, our spouse, work, commuting, shopping for groceries, what political candidate to support. This variety of thought will not contribute any money to Wall Street's profits. That's why Wall Street wants to get closer to you. It wants its presence to be more obvious. It wants its financial spores to take root right in your brain. And the best way to do that is by advertising.</p> <p>Just now, Wall Street won an important victory in that effort. An important barrier between the Street and regular investors fell: the Securities and Exchange Commission for the first time <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323899704578584031104423110.html\">allowed hedge funds to advertise to regular people</a>, including through direct-mail campaigns.</p> <p>Hedge funds, for those who are unfamiliar, are pools of money from institutions and (usually rich) people, who contribute their money to hedge-fund managers who deploy the dollars however they like: in stocks, in bonds, in Slovenian securities or Chinese companies.</p> <p>The new SEC policy is a radical departure from previous rules, which forced hedge funds to stay so far out of the consciousness of any regular investor that most of the funds didn't even have their own websites. The thinking behind that old rule was obvious: if Wall Street, with its sophistication, has direct access to the money of unsophisticated people, it will likely end in tears.</p> <p>Now, we have discarded that caution, perhaps unwisely. Hedge funds can show up on your doorstep, if they wish. They only have to limit their approaches to individual investors who are \"accredited\". That sounds exclusive, but it's not much protection.</p> <p>Right now, accredited means <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/accredited-investor-net-worth-standard-secg.htm\">having a net worth of $1m or more</a>, not counting the value of your home. In a bad economy that sounds rich, but actually it's not such rarified air to breathe any more: There are now about <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/100552951\">9 million Americans in the United States who are millionaires</a>; that's nearly even with the previous all-time record set in 2006.</p> <p>A lot of this, however, is a false kind of wealth. People in the United States don't have any more money in their bank accounts. The net worth of a few people has risen simply because the stock market has done so well in recent years, boosting the value of their retirement accounts.<br>Many of those people are baby-boomers, which means they'll be able to cash in those accounts soon, if they haven't already. That means more ready money at hand, and some people will be looking to re-invest it. The wolves of Wall Street are ready.</p> <p>But investors should be wary. Giving money to a hedge fund does not mean investors will make a profit; it doesn't even guarantee they'll ever see the money again. Hedge funds are, by their nature, risky. Anyone who gets the investing itch after cashing in a 401(k) should picture an entire retirement <em>without that money</em>. There are several reasons for this.</p> <p>For one thing, there are the fees. Many hedge funds charge exorbitant fees, which pay the managers handsomely even if they don't increase your money by a cent. This is called the <a href=\"http://www.hedgefundmarketing.org/hedge-fund-fees/\">\"two-and-twenty\" fee structure</a>: managers get 2% of all the assets in the fund for themselves regardless of whether they grow your money. And if they do make any profit on the investments, they get 20% of the riches, again for themselves.</p> <p>For another thing, there are the returns. Plenty of hedge-fund managers just aren't that good at what they do: the vast majority, for all their fancy strategies, don't beat the S&amp;P 500 index. Last year \u2013 in a booming market \u2013 hedge funds returned, on average, only 8% \u2013 compared to 16% for the S&amp;P 500, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/hedge-fund-underperforming-2013-5\">according to research from Goldman Sachs</a>. This year, through May, hedge funds returned 5% \"compared with 15% gains for both the S&amp;P 500 and the average large-cap core mutual fund,\" the Goldman report revealed.</p> <p>There are some hedge-fund managers who do better than that, but in general, these are the ones who only manage huge sums. The entry level here can be $100m or more.</p> <p>The other side of the coin is that there will always be regular investors who overestimate their own sophistication. A growing number of baby-boomers have taken to trading in <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/09/us-options-boomers-idUSBRE9680U620130709\">options, a kind of Wall Street derivative</a>. Many large financial players, including Schwab, savvily <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/stockbroker-schwab-moves-options\">moved to advertise options trading to regular people back in 2011</a> \u2013 and that has paid off for them. The question is whether it will also pay off, long-term, for the boomers who are betting their pension plans.</p> <p>Make no mistake: anyone who is not a professional investor is outmatched in the market. In fact, most professional investors are outmatched in the market: it's bigger, more complicated, more full of information and more intimidating than any single person can really wrap their heads around.</p> <p>Just take, for instance, the issue of \"information asymmetry\". Thomson Reuters has been charging some investors extra dues for providing key economic information, such as consumer confidence numbers, a mere two seconds ahead of general release. (What Reuters has been doing is likely entirely legal, according even to opponents of the practice.) This provides insight into how Wall Street works. It is always possible to pay for better trading advantages, which means that the game is rigged. But those privileges go only to the highest bidder. So, if you're working just with your retirement fund, you can't afford the price of entry to the Wall Street club \u2026 and you're much more likely to lose money.</p> <p>Inevitably, people with $1m will be seduced by the glamor attached to the idea of investing in hedge funds.

      "bodyText": "And finally...our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, has interviewed eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem about the state of the eurozone. Among other points, the Dutch finance minister warns that the EC might not be granted its wish of getting the powers to wind up failed European banks (see 4.30pm) Dijsselbloem said: It's not completely decided what that authority should look like. The main thing is it should be effective. You need to be able to decide overnight, over a weekend. He also warned that the \u20ac60bn fund that will officially be set aside to refinance banks is really a last resort. Tapping it will certainly not be the first response: The \u20ac60bn cap is mainly to give a signal that the direct recapitalisation is a means of last resort,\" said the Dutch minister. \"Once again for too long we have been thinking public backstops are standing right in front \u2026 We want to change that. The \u20ac60bn is basically a political message saying it's going right to the end. Private means private investors. So resolution funds have to be used first. The \u20ac60bn is a political statement saying let's not start with the ESM.\" Here's Ian's full story: Eurozone finance head questions Brussels power bid over banks And that's a good moment to stop. Back tomorrow - until then, thanks and goodnight. Further industrial action in Greece -- this time in protest at the new state broadcaster being introduced by the Athens government: Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic sagged today, in a pretty uneventful session. China's surprise drop in imports and exports (see opening post) weighed on traders, while fears of political instability in Italy hit the Milan stock market. Here's the closing prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 8 points at 6504, - 0.1% \u2022 German DAX: down 9 points at 8048, -0.1% \u2022 French CAC: down 3 points at 3840, -0.08% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 19 points at 7995, -0.25% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 113 points at 15677, - 0.7% Investors were cautious ahead of the release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve's last monthly meeting, at 7pm BST. And then a speech from Fed chair Ben Bernanke at 9pm BST. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index is down just 27 points, or 0.18%, at 15274. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sums the day up: European markets spent most of the day trading on the back foot, pushed lower over concern about the latest deterioration in Chinese economic data which showed significant declines in both exports and imports for the month of June. Given that these figures came on the back of a blanket downgrade of growth forecasts by the IMF yesterday, the surprise weakness in the latest batch of Chinese data has reinforced negative perceptions about the possibility of a much sharper than anticipated Chinese slowdown. Elsewhere in Europe we\u2019ve also seen further deterioration in economic data, from both France and Italy, as well as a downgrade from Standard and Poor\u2019s for Italy with a negative outlook, due to weakening economic prospects and the country\u2019s impaired banking system. There is also the added factor that investors lack the confidence to push this week\u2019s gains much further ahead of the release of the latest FOMC minutes and Bernanke\u2019s speech later tonight. A new conflict opened up between Brussels and the German government today after the European Commission proposed that it should be given the power to wind up failed lenders. Under the EC's proposal, presented this morning, it would control the \"Single Resolution Mechanism\u201d, which would give it the power to close down any of the eurozone's 6,400 financial institutions. It would be backed with \u20ac60bn, eventually, in cross-border funds. As we reported this morning Michel Barnier, European commissioner, argued it made sense to put the SRM in the hands of the EC: We have seen how the collapse of a major cross-border bank can lead to a complex and confusing situation,. We need a system which can deliver decisions quickly and efficiently, avoiding doubts on the impact on public finances, and with rules that create certainty in the market But Barnier's claim that tready changes are not needed will alarm Berlin. The FT sums it up: Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has said a single authority requires a new EU treaty and on the eve of the announcement, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, her finance minister, warned Brussels to respect the limits of the law or \u201crisk major turbulence\u201d. France, Italy and Spain are more enthusiastic about rapid centralisation. Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner responsible for the reforms, said he had \u201clistened carefully\u201d to the legal concerns but was convinced action was necessary possible without delay. This treaty issue has also alarmed Open Europe - here's its initial analysis of the SRM plans: New Open Europe flash analysis: Controversial second pillar of banking union looks insufficient to hold up eurozone roof in a crisis Analysts at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale also fear that the situation in Italy could unravel. Italian journalist Fab Goria tweets the key points from their latest note. Beppe Grillo, the radical leader of Italy's Five Star movement which won strong support in spring's general election, has turned the political crisis dial up a notch. After meeting with president Georgio Napolitano today, Grillo declared that italy was heading for a catastrophe. He said he'd recommended that another election is called unless Enrico Letta's government gets to grips with the economic downturn quickly. Grillo told a press conference that: I thanked Napolitano for his...concern and I expressed my concern for the state of the economic, social and political life of the country. I told the president that he has taken a...huge responsibility, and I asked him to go to the polls if necessary. (quotes translated by the ANSA news agency) Grillo was speaking as Enrico Letta's government was buffetted by the walkout called by Silvio Berlusconi's PDL group, in protest at his final appeal being brought forward. The Five Star leader took the opportunity to tell reporters that the government should cut spending on military projects, and spends more on benefits for pensioners. He also said Italy, whose GDP is expected to fall by 1.8% this year, was in the equivalent of a 'war economy' and needed urgent measures. From Rome, our Southern Europe editor John Hooper writes: The parliamentary leaders of Silvio Berlusconi's party have demanded the suspension of parliament in protest at a decision by the supreme court aimed at preventing him from evading a four-year jail sentence on a technicality. The heads of the media tycoon's Freedom People (PdL) movement in both chambers said they wanted the legislature to cease all activity for three days. The centre-left Democratic Party (PD), which is joined to the PdL in Italy's left-right coalition, immediately rejected the demand, opening a rift within Enrico Letta's already fragile government. Here's the full story: Berlusconi party protests at attempt to close loophole that could spare him jail Italy's highest criminal court has defended its decision to fast-track Silvio Berlusconi's final appeal in the long-running Mediaset tax fraud trial, amid growing political fallout over the decision. The Cassation judges said they had followed normal procedures by scheduling the heading on 30 July, earlier than expected, because the statute of limitations on one of the charges expired on 1 August. Berlusconi was sentenced to a four-year prison term and five-year ban from holding public office, and while the jail term could be set aside the former PM faces being thrown out of parliament. Members of Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL) party are now boycotting a government summit today, and Reuters reckons that \"almost all activity\" in both houses of parliament has been suspended. PDL are one of two main partners in Enrico Letta's fragile coalition government. Today's walkout adds to concerns, flagged up by John Hooper this morning, that the government's future is at risk. Keep Talking Greece reports that next week's Greek general strike, on 16 July, will include a protest march starting at 12.30pm local time (see 12.05pm for earlier details). It adds that civil servants will down tools at noon tomorrow, and hold a protest in Klafthmonos square in downtown Athens. Portugal's president will speak to the nation tonight following days of talks with its political leaders, after the (temporary) resignation of junior coalition leader Paulo Portas prompted a short-term panic. With Portas back in the fold (promoted to deputy PM and preaching unity and stability), and Portuguese borrowing costs lower (10-year bonds are yielding 6.8% this afternoon, down from the 8% hit last week), the crisis may have abated.... Open Europe have published a blogpost on the news that Silvio Berlusconi's final appeal in the Mediaset tax fraud trial will take place on 30th July. Like John Hooper (at 9.50am), they believe it could have serious consequences: Berlusconi's party wants to suspend all parliamentary activities for three days in protest against the Supreme Court's decision, or it will pull out of the coalition- which would deprive Enrico Letta's government of its majority in parliament and potentially make snap elections a real prospect. The impression is that, even if this immediate threat were turned down, the survival of the Italian government may be put in doubt again shortly should the Supreme Court uphold the five-year public office ban for Berlusconi - making it definitive and effective. More here: Is Italy already heading for fresh political uncertainty? Opposition to Greece's financial programme continues to build, with unions calling a new 24-hour general strike next week and protests continuing today. GSEE, the main private sector union, has announced a one-day walkout on July 16th, next Tuesday. It will be the first major protest since the Athens government reached an agreement with its lenders, unlocking its next aid payments with a promise to push on with public sector layoffs. GSEE said the planned job cuts were unfair, and hasn't given up hope of changing the course of the bailout. The government and the lenders need to finally realise that we are people - not numbers. Our fight will continue and it will intensify as long as those who take decisions insist on driving the people to poverty. The Greek government tabled legislation last night to cut thousands of state sector jobs. MPs are expected to vote on it next week \u2013 potentially on the same day as the general strike. I flagged up at 8.34am that municipal workers - who are in the front line for layoffs - were continuing to protest today. Here are the latest pics: Associated Press has more details: Athens municipal police, angered by their inclusion in a government plan to reduce the number of civil servants and meet international bailout requirements, have occupied a municipal building in downtown Athens. The main union for municipal workers, who have been on strike for the past two days, has called for building occupations on Wednesday and Thursday, and has extended rolling 24-hour strikes for the rest of the week. Can the strikes do any good? They could strengthen the resolve of MPs who want to oppose the legislation to implement Greece's next bout of austerity. The government still has a majority in parliament, although narrower since Democratic Left quit the coalition. So it may simply be symbolic. But with the Troika already worrying that Greece lacks political motivation to stick to the bailout (see 9.02am), the strike won't make lenders any less concerned. Dire industrial output data from Greece this morning, which dents any hopes that the country's recession might finally be easing. Industrial output dropped by 4.6% on a year-on-year basis in May, and the report from ELSTAT showed how Greece's manufacturing and industrial base has suffered in the last 12 months: \u2022 Mining and quarrying production decreased by 19.6% (compared with May 2012). \u2022 Manufacturing production decreased by 1.8%. \u2022 Electricity production decreased by 10.3%. \u2022 Water supply production decreased by 1.2%. Political analysts Alberto Nardelli, and Vincenzo Scarpetta of the Open Europe thinktank, also agree that Silvio Berlusconi's court hearing at the end of this month is pretty significant.... Our Southern Europe editor, John Hooper, notes that the debt markets are shrugging off \u2013 not one --- but two bits of ominous news from Italy today: S&amp;P\u2019s downgrade came late in a day that also saw Italy\u2019s supreme court decide that it would rule on July 30th on Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s appeal against his conviction for tax fraud \u2013 much earlier than expected. Though his Bunga Bunga trial is the one that has \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 captured the media coverage, the tax dodging case is the one with the potential political punch. It was always known it would reach its climax first, and no one can predict how Berlusconi would react to a definitive conviction. One possibility open to him is to bring down Enrico Letta\u2019s three-party, left-right coalition in the same way he scuppered Mario Monti\u2019s non-party, technocratic government last year. If the case had been parked in the normal way for about six months, one of the counts on which he was charged would have been \u2018timed out\u2019 by a statute of limitations and the judges would probably have had to send the case back to a lower court. That in turn would have given more time for the other count to lapse. With the odds on an early election suddenly shorter \u2013 Corriere della Sera was speculating this morning it could be in October \u2013Berlusconi\u2019s followers in government will be less disposed to compromise on their demands. Chief among these is the fulfilment of their leader\u2019s election pledge to abolish a property tax on first homes. So far, the debate on this has revolved around the effects on Italy\u2019s public finances -- it would not exactly enhance its chances of paying off its huge debts. But in its reasoning S&amp;P highlighted another issue. The ratings agency pointed to a \u201cbudgetary composition that deters growth\u201d, and in two respects. One is that \u201cCurrent expenditure is disproportionately high compared with capital expenditure\u201d. But the other is that \u201ctax levels on capital and labour are higher than those on property and consumption.\u201d Despite these problems, Italian government debt has only weakened slightly (see 8.18am). Europe's stock markets are dropping, though, following this morning's worrying trade data from China: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 18 points at 6494 \u2022 German DAX: down 36 points at 8021, -0.45% \u2022 French CAC: down 20 points at 3823, -0.5% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 109 points at 7905, -1.36% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 200 points at 15589, - 1.29% The Netherlands has followed France (see 8.08am) by reporting a drop in manufacturing output in May -- it fell 0.6%, after a 0.6% rise in April. And Italy has reported a 0.1% rise in industrial production - the first increase in four months. Analysts had expected a stronger rise, though, of 0.3%. Put together, it suggests May wasn't a great month for many of eurozone's larger economies. Speaking of Greece.... last night Reuters published extracts from the Troika's latest assessment of the Greek situation, and it's rather worrying. It appears Greece's lenders are losing confidence in the Athens government, despite finally agree to extend its next loan on Monday. The report questions Greece's \"willingness and capacity\" to collect taxes, and warns that officials identified \"new shortfalls\" in Greece's fiscal plans. That implies further austerity measures could be needed, on top of what's already been agreed. Here's a flavour of the report: The strengthening of the tax administration constitutes a key pillar of the fiscal consolidation strategy...Failure to deliver the targeted improvement in collection performance would imply the need to seek alternative measures to close the emerging fiscal gap. More here: Lenders sound alarm over lack of action in Athens Over in Greece, some municipal staff are continuing to protest against the Greek government's plan to trim its public sector workforce. The municipal union called a two-day strike on Monday, against plans to place thousands of employees in the new 'mobility pool'. Locals in Athens reports that the protest has run into a third day, with government workers are occupying some town halls (via Theodora Oikonomides) Eurozone bond trader Gustavo Baratta confirms that the S&amp;P downgrade of Italy has not caused alarm: Italy appears to be largely shrugging off last night's credit rating downgrade from Standard &amp; Poors. Italian sovereign debt has weakened a little this morning, pushing up the yield on its 10-year bonds to 4.45%, from 4.39% yesterday afternoon. That's a fairly soft reaction, though. A year or two ago, a one-notch downgrade would probably have spooked bond investors rather more. The Italian stock market, the FTSE MIB, has dropped by around 0.5% in early trading, led by its banks (who can expect their own ratings to be lowered by S&amp;P). S&amp;P blamed the worsening Italian economic outlook for its decision to cut Italy's rating to BBB, from BBB+. It expects GDP to fall by 1.9% this year, even worse than the IMF's new forecast of a 1.8% contraction. Just in \u2013 confirmation that France's manufacturing sector continued to struggle in May. Industrial output in Europe's second-largest economy fell by 0.4% month-on-month, driven by a 1.1% drop in manufacturing output. INSEE, the statistics body, said that French manufacturing output is now 1.9% lower than in May 2012: Output went down in other manufacturing (-2.4%), in the manufacture of food products and beverages (-2.3%), in the manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment and machine equipment (-1.1%) and in the manufacture of transport equipment (-1.4%). On the opposite, manufacturing output bounced by 13.9% in the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products. The 0.4% drop in industrial output is actually better than analysts had expected (a 0.8% fall was pencilled in), but it won't help France climb out of recession. Here's INSEE's full statement. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the world economy and the financial markets. Europe is waking up to new fears of a global slowdown after disappointing economic data from China overnight. China suffered a 3.1% drop in exports in June, the first time exports had shrunk since the start of 2012, and the biggest monthly fall since October 2009. Imports shrank by 0.7% for the second month in a row, alarming economists who expected both imports and exports to rise. And Customs spokesman Zheng Yuesheng did little to calm nerves, telling reporters in Beijing that China faced a 'grim' outlook. \"Prolonged slugging foreign demand\" was hurting exporters, he said \u2013 a nod to the long downturn in the eurozone. Zheng added: Currently, China's foreign trade is facing grave challenges. Some analysts are suggesting that we're now getting the true picture of the Chinese economy, after officials clamped down on a scam where firms would invent export sales as a way of sneaking capital into the country (here's a good explanation of the practive on the Financial Times). The trade figures are causing concern in Europe and Asia -- a day after the International Monetary Fund trimmed its growth forecasts for both China and the eurozone (details here), and warned that emerging markets are facing tougher times. A weakening Chinese economy is a blow to the eurozone's efforts to drag itself back to growth (as well as being partly triggered by weak demand in Europe). New Chinese GDP data is due next week. Ian Williams of Peel Hunt warned: The downside risks to the 2013 GDP forecast are increasing. Gloom abounds. We get new industrial production data from France and Italy this morning, which will show how two of the eurozone's larger members are faring. I'll also be monitoring reaction to last night's one-notch downgrade of Italy by Standard &amp; Poors, and fresh corruption allegations in Spain, along with all the main action through the day....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Strong sales of men's clothing, large leather bags and coats during dismal spring weather in Europe helped British luxury brand Burberry to a better than expected performance in the first quarter of its financial year. Angela Ahrendts, the chief executive, said: \"Spring/summer 2013 was a standout season driven by innovative marketing, cohesive monthly fashion groups and exceptional execution.\" The company, which recently signed actress Sienna Miller and her fianc\u00e9 Tom Sturridge to front its advertising campaign, recorded an 18% rise in sales, at constant exchange rates, to \u00a3339m, well ahead of analysts' expectations. When the impact of new store sales were stripped out, sales rose 13%, up from 8% growth in the previous three months. The number of staff making Burberry's signature raincoat at its British factory in Castleford, West Yorkshire, has been doubled since 2011 amid high demand, with sales of outerwear and large leather goods such as its Blaze and Orchard bags accounting for half the brand's sales growth. Menswear sales rose 25% over the quarter as the label brought its men's catwalk show back to London this year. One customer was tennis ace Andy Murray who wore a Burberry suit for his visit to Downing Street after his Wimbledon triumph. Menswear now accounts for nearly a quarter of the company's sales and Carol Fairweather, chief financial officer, said it was a \"significant growth opportunity\" for the future. Growth was strongest in Asia with Burberry outperforming rivals in the all-important Chinese market by harnessing the power of social media to raise the profile of the brand and by opening more large and glamorous stores. It saw double-digit underlying sales growth in the country over the quarter. Fairweather said: \"We've got a lot of self-help measures and quite a long way to go in China compared to some of our peers.\" Two shops were opened in Shanghai during the quarter and another flagship store is planned to open in China later this year. The group has bounced back from a profit warning last September after sales in China had slowed. The company said \"soft\" trading at its high street stores was offset by strong growth online, partly helped by the use of iPads by shopfloor staff to help customers order goods that were not immediately available. Burberry is also experimenting with allowing shoppers to pick up goods ordered via the internet at flagship stores including outlets in London in Knightsbridge and Regent Street. But Ahrendts, who topped the UK's pay league with a total package of \u00a316.9m last year, almost \u00a35m more than the next highest paid chief executive, warned that the macroeconomic outlook remained \"uncertain\" and that first half profits would fall below those of last year, partly because of the cost of bringing Burberry's fragrance and beauty business back in-house.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem challenges European commission's plan to have authority to close banks", 
      "body": "<p>A fresh eurozone power struggle has broken out after the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers promptly questioned Wednesday's attempt by Brussels to turn itself into the final referee on the viability of eurozone banks.</p> <p>In draft legislation unveiled on Wednesday the European commission controversially proposed giving itself the last resort power to order a troubled eurozone bank to close.</p> <p>But the president of the eurogroup, the Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, immediately challenged the commission's proposals.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian and four other European papers, Dijsselbloem, who has led a radical policy shift in recent months on the eurozone's response to four years of crisis, said it was not yet clear who would be granted the key powers to resolve, wind up, and close down failing eurozone banks, but that the new authority had to be \"decisive, effective, and impartial\".</p> <p>\"It's not completely decided what that authority should look like,\" he said. \"The main thing is it should be effective. You need to be able to decide overnight, over a weekend.\"</p> <p>The European commission in Brussels, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, the German government in Berlin and others are all at odds over who is to be granted the powers of deciding what to do about struggling eurozone financial institutions whose dismal performance have contributed hugely to four years of sovereign debt crisis that have shaken the single currency to its foundations.</p> <p>The eurozone's answer is a new permanent banking union, making the ECB the single supervisor of Eurozone banks, alongside a banks resolution authority \u2013 and perhaps eventually a common Eurozone system of guarantees for depositors.</p> <p>Wednesday's gambit to leave in Brussels the final decision on whether to order a bank closed down will be hotly contested in Berlin and Frankfurt. But Dijsselbloem, president of the eurogroup or the key committee of eurozone finance ministers since the beginning of the year, ruled out granting the powers to the ECB.</p> <p>\"The supervisory and the resolution authorities should not be the same,\" he said.</p> <p>While the various actors tussle over who gets to take some of the biggest decisions in the single currency area, it is already clear the Dutch social democrat has already helped engineer a strategic shift during his first six months presiding over the crucial meetings of eurozone finance ministers.</p> <p>In recent weeks the policy U-turn from bailouts to so called \"bail-ins\" has crystallised, shifting the onus of rescuing banks and propping up governments from public money and taxpayers to the banks themselves and their creditors, who will suffer big losses in future emergencies.</p> <p>\"It's the best way to address risk in the financial system,\" said Dijsselbloem, \"the only way to get a healthy responsible financial sector.\"</p> <p>The policy shift means that the eurozone's \u20ac500bn permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), is to serve as a backstop for the troubled currency, but unlike in the past may never be used. As the ECB prepares to oversee the banking sector, \u20ac60bn of that fund has also been set aside for bank recapitalisation. It is also clear that there is very little intention of using that instrument either.</p> <p>\"The \u20ac60bn cap is mainly to give a signal that the direct recapitalisation is a means of last resort,\" said the Dutch minister. \"Once again for too long we have been thinking public backstops are standing right in front \u2026 We want to change that.

      "bodyText": "A fresh eurozone power struggle has broken out after the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers promptly questioned Wednesday's attempt by Brussels to turn itself into the final referee on the viability of eurozone banks. In draft legislation unveiled on Wednesday the European commission controversially proposed giving itself the last resort power to order a troubled eurozone bank to close. But the president of the eurogroup, the Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, immediately challenged the commission's proposals. In an interview with the Guardian and four other European papers, Dijsselbloem, who has led a radical policy shift in recent months on the eurozone's response to four years of crisis, said it was not yet clear who would be granted the key powers to resolve, wind up, and close down failing eurozone banks, but that the new authority had to be \"decisive, effective, and impartial\". \"It's not completely decided what that authority should look like,\" he said. \"The main thing is it should be effective. You need to be able to decide overnight, over a weekend.\" The European commission in Brussels, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, the German government in Berlin and others are all at odds over who is to be granted the powers of deciding what to do about struggling eurozone financial institutions whose dismal performance have contributed hugely to four years of sovereign debt crisis that have shaken the single currency to its foundations. The eurozone's answer is a new permanent banking union, making the ECB the single supervisor of Eurozone banks, alongside a banks resolution authority \u2013 and perhaps eventually a common Eurozone system of guarantees for depositors. Wednesday's gambit to leave in Brussels the final decision on whether to order a bank closed down will be hotly contested in Berlin and Frankfurt. But Dijsselbloem, president of the eurogroup or the key committee of eurozone finance ministers since the beginning of the year, ruled out granting the powers to the ECB. \"The supervisory and the resolution authorities should not be the same,\" he said. While the various actors tussle over who gets to take some of the biggest decisions in the single currency area, it is already clear the Dutch social democrat has already helped engineer a strategic shift during his first six months presiding over the crucial meetings of eurozone finance ministers. In recent weeks the policy U-turn from bailouts to so called \"bail-ins\" has crystallised, shifting the onus of rescuing banks and propping up governments from public money and taxpayers to the banks themselves and their creditors, who will suffer big losses in future emergencies. \"It's the best way to address risk in the financial system,\" said Dijsselbloem, \"the only way to get a healthy responsible financial sector.\" The policy shift means that the eurozone's \u20ac500bn permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), is to serve as a backstop for the troubled currency, but unlike in the past may never be used. As the ECB prepares to oversee the banking sector, \u20ac60bn of that fund has also been set aside for bank recapitalisation. It is also clear that there is very little intention of using that instrument either. \"The \u20ac60bn cap is mainly to give a signal that the direct recapitalisation is a means of last resort,\" said the Dutch minister. \"Once again for too long we have been thinking public backstops are standing right in front \u2026 We want to change that. The \u20ac60bn is basically a political message saying it's going right to the end. Private means private investors. So resolution funds have to be used first. The \u20ac60bn is a political statement saying let's not start with the ESM.\" If the new system comes into effect late next year, as expected, countries such as Greece, Spain or Ireland will not be able to make retroactive claims on the fund to clean up their government balance sheets after ploughing tens of billions into the banking sector. The ESM and direct bank recapitalisation should be targeted at future problems, not the past, said Dijsselbloem. \"Any requests for retroactivity will soon use up the fund \u2026 It would mean a massive claim on the ESM. I don't see enough political support for it generally.\" Dijsselbloem was strongly criticised for his handling of the \u20ac10bn Cyprus bailout in March and ran into more problems when he described the Cypriot package as the template for future eurozone rescues. But it has since become clear that Cyprus has indeed become a form of model, signaling the shift in emphasis away from taxpayer-funded bailouts to large haircuts for investors, a change intended to encourage more responsible banking, punish excessive risk-taking and curb the casino capitalism of international finance. Critics say the policy shift may simply deter investment in the fragile periphery and promote a rush to eurozone safe havens, such as Germany, the real driver of the policy U-turn articulated by Dijsselbloem. He conceded that the Cyprus experiment was a gamble and that governments and the media anticipated a negative reaction in the markets because of the losses being inflicted on investors. \"It had a shock effect,\" he said. \"But it was very short. It was not justified. The reaction in the markets was moderate and short.\"",

      "bodyText": "For the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, the ratings agency Moody's has upgraded the outlook for the British banking sector. The agency has had a negative outlook on UK banks since May 2008 but on Wednesday moved it to stable, based on the economic outlook and improving capital position of banks. While the sector as a whole is on a stable outlook, the long-term debt and deposit ratings of the large banks remain on a negative outlook because Moody's believes that the UK authorities want to avoid using taxpayer support in future collapses. The announcement came as the European Union set out rules that would put the onus on shareholders and bondholders to incur losses when banks are close to collapse, rather than the institutions turning to taxpayers. Although economic growth in the UK is expected to remain low, Moody's does not expect this to have an adverse effect on the operating environment for banks. The Bank of England has indicated that it expects interest rates to remain low, which will help households and companies maintain their debt payments. \"Moreover, unemployment has not increased as much as in previous recessions, supporting banks' asset quality,\" Moody's said. While the banks are facing changes to regulation \u2013 requiring them to hold more capital and additional liquid assets that can be sold quickly \u2013 the agency said these should eventually mean that the systemic risk should be reduced. Moody's has conducted its own stress tests and concluded that the five major banks in the UK \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays and Santander \u2013 would be able to absorb losses under very stressed conditions. The closely watched measure of capital strength \u2013 known as the tier one ratio \u2013 would be 10.3% under a base scenario and fall to 6.9% under the more severe stressed scenario. The Prudential Regulation Authority, which regulates the major lenders, last month published the results of its own stress tests and has ordered RBS, Lloyds, Barclays, Nationwide Building Society and the Co-operative Bank to find extra capital. One of the main risks to a bank is commercial property lending and exposure to peripheral European economics. \"We believe that UK banks are sufficiently well-capitalised to sustain expected losses from both our central and adverse stress scenarios,\" Moody's said. \"More specifically, once the large UK banks execute their capital plans (which we deem achievable) to address the additional capital buffer requirements recently imposed by the PRA, we believe that UK banks will be well capitalised for the risks they face and will compare favourably to their European peers.\" The report by Moody's comes as the UK prepares to sell off its 39% stake in Lloyds with its 81% stake in RBS expected to be disposed of later.",
