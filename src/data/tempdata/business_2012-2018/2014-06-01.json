      "bodyText": "With soil sliding in from the banks, leaf litter collecting from overhanging trees and Japanese koi producing waste, the pond outside the production facility of Lifesaver Systems was perfectly filthy. Dipping into the water what appeared to be an outsized plastic water bottle, Michael Pritchard scooped up some of the brownish gunk, sealed the bottle with a screwable base and pushed its pump a few times. When he opened the teat at the top of the bottle, clear water sprayed out, leaving behind the pond detritus. \"That,\" he said as he sipped the liquid from a glass, \"is clean, sterile, drinking water.\" The 750ml Lifesaver bottle was the first product in a range created by Pritchard eight years ago that uses filtration technology previously applied only in industrial sectors. With sales worth about \u00a310m expected this year, the bottles, handheld cans and tanks have been used by hill walkers and British soldiers in Afghanistan as well as communities in the developing world blighted by natural disasters that have disrupted the flow of clean safe water. Up until 2004, Pritchard had had a varied career, from property developer to Apple salesman. Then, after that year's Boxing Day tsunami, he was frustrated by images of people at risk when they found themselves surrounded by water but unable to drink it. Eight months later the US was hit by Hurricane Katrina. \"I thought this was a first-world country, they will have it licked,\" he said. \"They were trucking water in. I felt this drive to do something more and said 'I am going to find a solution to this problem.'\" He added: \"Go out walking in the hills for three days and don't take any water. You see how quickly water is the only thing you focus on and nothing else. It is so powerful: people will kill each other for water. It is so emotive, so deep inside us. It makes people go mad.\" Water cleansing techniques had focused on chlorine tablets, which ran the risk of people mistaking them for medicine and eating them. There were also traditional ceramic filters, but these could not filter out viruses such as polio \u2013 which measured 25 billionths of a metre (or 25 nanometres) in diameter, he said. Pritchard described a \"technical brick wall\" that had not been resolved because water could not be forced through a filter with such minute pores. However, industrial facilities had technology where water was forced, with power, through membranes with 15-nanometre widths. \"You can't do it by hand because you can't generate the pressure, so I knew if I could get [compressed] air to work, then air could generate enough pressure needed to force the water across,\" he said. The outcome was the Lifesaver bottle, which uses a handheld pump mechanism to force water from the outside to the inside of a narrow coiled tube inside the device. The tube parts have pores that are 15 nanometres wide, small enough to filter out bacteria and viruses. The bottle was launched at a defence and security equipment show in 2007 and 1,000 units were sold in two days. On the back of the same show, a \u00a31m contract to supply the bottles to British soldiers in Afghanistan was won after the technology was cleared by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. As soldiers were now carrying less water on their backs, their performance was improving, said Pritchard. In the aid community, - the original intended audience for the system - agencies \"weren't getting it\", said Pritchard. So an 18.5-litre jerry can was launched using the same technology, and was then taken to Pakistan by M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res. Other agencies balked at the unit price of $150. A third product, a five-litre \"cube\", was designed for women and children to carry; it could be stacked efficiently on pallets for shipping. A 750-litre tank with multiple taps was also created with the assistance of the Malaysian government. Lifesaver Systems, which is based in Essex and fully owned by Pritchard and his wife, had sales of \u00a36.5m last year and has been in profit since its first year. A third of the business is directed towards the military and the leisure sector (aimed at campers and trekkers), with the remainder catering to humanitarian bodies, which get products at discounts that still give the company a profit. Pritchard said some people within the aid community were resisting change. \"Aid agencies are starting to get that, 'so what that chlorine tablets are 0.8 pence a tablet, who cares?' It is not about that. It is about what you are delivering. Am I delivering long-term, sustainable, resilient technology that works, that is lifting people out of water poverty? They get it. And that is why they are buying it,\" he said. Military customers could save money by not having to ship water into battle areas, while families in the developing world who might have spent their medicine money on bottled water now had more disposable income through using the devices, Pritchard said. How it works The smallest bacteria are about 200 nanometres in diameter while the smallest viruses are 25 nanometres. The holes in the membranes used by Lifesaver are 15 nanometres wide, blocking bacteria, viruses, cysts and waterborne pathogens from getting through. Dirty water can can be left in the unit until it needs to be cleaned. The cartridge in the bottle is replaced after through-put of 4,000 or 6,000 litres, while the jerry can lasts for between 10,000 and 20,000 litres. Towards the end of the life of the unit, more pumps areneeded. When the pumps no longer work, the filters have to be replaced. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2 014 to correct the spelling of bacteria in the photo caption.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe's banks were bracing themselves over the weekend for much anticipated cuts in the eurozone's commercial interest rates to boost the currency zone's struggling economy. European Central Bank (ECB) boss Mario Draghi is expected to reduce the rate at which commercial banks borrow from 0.25% to 0.15% to encourage business lending. The Frankfurt-based institution is also expected to cut the interest rate it pays to banks that keep funds on deposit in a further move to discourage lenders from hoarding cash. Draghi is under pressure to kickstart bank lending after recent figures showed that Netherlands, Italy, Finland and Portugal saw their economies contract in the first three months of the year while France stagnated. Only Germany prevented the eurozone from heading back into recession after after a 0.8% growth spurt. Low inflation across the 18 members of the currency zone has also discouraged shoppers from spending on the high street and undermined business investment and union-led attempts to raise wages. In April inflation rose to 0.7 from 0.5% in March, but remained in what the ECB calls the \"danger zone\" of below 1%, and well below the ECB's target of close to 2%. Worse still, figures for May showed that Italy's EU-harmonised inflation rate eased to a weaker-than-expected 0.4% year-on-year from 0.5% in April. Corresponding inflation in Spain was 0.2%, down from 0.3%. But the ECB is unlikely to mimic the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England and pump billions of euros into the banking system with a programme of quantitative easing (QE). The ECB, which will announce its decision on Thursday, is known to have come close to voting for QE, but conservative forces on the governing council have resisted the plans. \"We are aware of the risks of a too prolonged low inflation period,\" Draghi told an ECB conference outside Lisbon last week, adding that he and his colleagues had to be \"particularly watchful\" for any negative price spiral. At the last policy meeting in May, Draghi said the ECB was comfortable with acting in June if updated staff forecasts showed the situation remained the same or worse. \"Draghi's May press conference raised market expectations of action, and the ECB will want to appear bold,\" said Nikolaus Keis, economist at Unicredit. \"The risk is that monetary conditions may quickly start tightening anew if the ECB's moves are perceived as too timid.\" Howard Archer, chief European economist at HS Global Insight, said economic conditions in the eurozone \"certainly justify strong action\". In the absence of further monetary support, the euro would rise against the dollar, hurting exporters and deterring business investment, he said. \"Ever since Mr. Draghi's comments after the 8 May ECB policy meeting that the ECB is \"comfortable\" with taking action in June to counter prolonged very low eurozone inflation and the strength of the euro, it has looked much more likely than not that the bank will follow through and move at its 5 June policy meeting. He added: \"However, we remain doubtful that the ECB will undertake full blown QE. We suspect this will only happen if eurozone consumer price inflation falls to new lows below 0.5% over the coming months and eurozone growth falters further.\"",

    "webTitle": "The pension changes are a cute move politically, but it may end in tears | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lamborghini dealers are licking their lips. Lots of lovely lolly will be coming their way when the government's new relaxed rules on pensions come into force next spring, giving people more freedom to do what they want with the money they have saved for retirement. Steve Webb, the pensions minister, has said he is relaxed about the prospect of men of a certain age blowing their savings on Italian sports cars. It is, the government believes, a matter of choice. In political terms, the pension changes are a cute move. The number of new annuities sold by life insurance companies has halved since George Osborne announced his initiative in the budget, and in the months leading up to next April, those on the brink of retirement will be considering what to do with their pension pots. So, expect the first three or four months of 2015 to be marked by strong demand for cars, cruises and property as people decide what to do with their nest egg. This will be the period running up to the May 2015 general election, when stories suggesting that the economy is humming will do Osborne no harm whatsoever. Whether the changes are a good idea in the long run is another matter. Many industry insiders think they will prove to be a mistake, although that won't be evident for some time. \"It will end in tears but a long time hence,\" says Steve Groves, chief executive of specialist annuity provider Partnership. The experience of Australia is that many people do indeed blow a chunk of their savings on holidays and cars. What's more, many of them don't bother to wait until they are retired to access the cash: they simply borrow money against the lump sum they know will arrive a few years down the road. But it's no real surprise that the chancellor announced what some believe will be the death knell for annuities. Customers hated them, and with good reason, according to a scathing report from the Financial Conduct Authority this year. The FCA said they were poor value for money, especially for those with the least put by for their retirement. If ever there was a case of \"where are the customers' yachts?\" then annuities are it. There are, though, two more reasons why annuities are currently so low. The first is monetary policy since the financial crisis. The Bank of England has kept both short- and long-term interest rates ultra-low through a combination of a 0.5% bank rate and \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing. That has affected annuity rates, because the sums quoted by life companies depend on how much they think they can make with the lump sum handed over. Higher interest rates mean higher returns and thus higher annuities. There is an upside to low rates, pointed out by the Bank's Andy Haldane last week. He said it was really a case of swings and roundabouts. Low interest rates mean low annuity rates, but they also mean higher asset prices, thus boosting the size of pension pots. The second reason annuity rates are low is that we are living longer. Annuities provide a guaranteed income and if the provider thinks we are going to live for 25 years after retirement rather than 15 years, that will affect what they offer. Annuities were not envisaged for people who give up work in their late 50s and live well into their 80s. It's also worth remembering that only a few lucky people have a million pounds stashed away for their old age. The average pot as measured by the mean is \u00a330,000; measured by the median it is \u00a317,000. It is not hard to see that, given the freedom, plenty of people will say: \"To hell with it, the annuity I will get with my relatively small pot is so small I might as well have a good time now, while I am still young enough to enjoy it. If I run out of money, the state can look after me.\" This won't be the case with everybody. Many Britons are petrified about the cost of lighting and heating their homes when they retire, and will bridle at the thought of not being able to pay their own way. The desire to spend a \u00a320,000 pension pot in one go may diminish once people realise that they will lose 20% of it straight to the taxman. In a perfect world, what would happen is that, freed from the compulsion to buy annuities of dubious worth, people would start to save more during their working lives. The financial services industry would live up to its boast that it can innovate to the benefit of customers. This would broaden the range of flexible products available, offering both an income for life and the chance to keep increasing the size of their fund. Meanwhile, the state would edge up the retirement age in line with rising longevity, and act as the backstop for the relatively small number of people who run out of money. The chances of this dream scenario materialising seem remote. Auto enrolment has been a sensible initiative, and should help increase national saving. But Britain is a low-wage economy, and the amounts many workers will be putting away are not going to add up to a big pension pot even after 30 or more years of contributions. A second problem is that the pension changes are likely to exacerbate ingrained weaknesses in the UK economy: the reluctance to defer gratification; the over-investment in bricks and mortar; the wealth gap between an asset-rich older generation and an asset-poor younger generation. It is a fair bet that the pension changes will lead to higher investment in buy-to-let properties. If they fall on hard times for any reason, they will expect the state to bail them out. In reality this involves younger workers frozen out of the housing market paying higher taxes. This will not be popular or, given an ageing population, sustainable. Instead, the government will continue pushing up the state retirement age into the low 70s so that the burden on taxpayers doesn't become too acute. This may seem reasonable in Guildford in Surrey, where male life expectancy at birth is 82; less attractive in Glasgow, where it is 72. Nor is right that those doing physically demanding jobs should carry on working into their 70s. So, Groves is almost certainly right. This can only avoid ending in tears if retirees use their pension pots to generate higher incomes than they do currently. It is hard to see how spending it on sports cars, holidays and even buy-to-let homes will do this. At some point Britain will think again about whether to return to some form of compulsory annuities. Interestingly, Australia is having that debate right now.",

Lots of lovely lolly will be coming their way when the government's new relaxed rules on pensions come into force next spring, giving people more freedom to do what they want with the money they have saved for retirement.</p> <p>Steve Webb, the pensions minister, has said he is relaxed about the prospect of men of a certain age blowing their savings on Italian sports cars. It is, the government believes, a matter of choice.</p> <p>In political terms, the pension changes are a cute move. The number of new annuities sold by life insurance companies has halved since George Osborne announced his initiative in the budget, and in the months leading up to next April, those on the brink of retirement will be considering what to do with their pension pots.</p> <p>So, expect the first three or four months of 2015 to be marked by strong demand for cars, cruises and property as people decide what to do with their nest egg. This will be the period running up to the May 2015 general election, when stories suggesting that the economy is humming will do Osborne no harm whatsoever.</p> <p>Whether the changes are a good idea in the long run is another matter. Many industry insiders think they will prove to be a mistake, although that won't be evident for some time. \"It will end in tears but a long time hence,\" says Steve Groves, chief executive of specialist annuity provider Partnership.</p> <p>The experience of Australia is that many people do indeed blow a chunk of their savings on holidays and cars. What's more, many of them don't bother to wait until they are retired to access the cash: they simply borrow money against the lump sum they know will arrive a few years down the road.</p> <p>But it's no real surprise that the chancellor announced what some believe will be the death knell for annuities. Customers hated them, and with good reason, according to a scathing report from the Financial Conduct Authority this year. The FCA said they were poor value for money, especially for those with the least put by for their retirement. If ever there was a case of \"where are the customers' yachts?\" then annuities are it.</p> <p>There are, though, two more reasons why annuities are currently so low. The first is monetary policy since the financial crisis. The Bank of England has kept both short- and long-term interest rates ultra-low through a combination of a 0.5% bank rate and \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing. That has affected annuity rates, because the sums quoted by life companies depend on how much they think they can make with the lump sum handed over. Higher interest rates mean higher returns and thus higher annuities.</p> <p>There is an upside to low rates, pointed out by the Bank's Andy Haldane last week. He said it was really a case of swings and roundabouts. Low interest rates mean low annuity rates, but they also mean higher asset prices, thus boosting the size of pension pots.</p> <p>The second reason annuity rates are low is that we are living longer. Annuities provide a guaranteed income and if the provider thinks we are going to live for 25 years after retirement rather than 15 years, that will affect what they offer. Annuities were not envisaged for people who give up work in their late 50s and live well into their 80s.</p> <p>It's also worth remembering that only a few lucky people have a million pounds stashed away for their old age. The average pot as measured by the mean is \u00a330,000; measured by the median it is \u00a317,000.</p> <p>It is not hard to see that, given the freedom, plenty of people will say: \"To hell with it, the annuity I will get with my relatively small pot is so small I might as well have a good time now, while I am still young enough to enjoy it. If I run out of money, the state can look after me.\"</p> <p>This won't be the case with everybody. Many Britons are petrified about the cost of lighting and heating their homes when they retire, and will bridle at the thought of not being able to pay their own way. The desire to spend a \u00a320,000 pension pot in one go may diminish once people realise that they will lose 20% of it straight to the taxman.</p> <p>In a perfect world, what would happen is that, freed from the compulsion to buy annuities of dubious worth, people would start to save more during their working lives. The financial services industry would live up to its boast that it can innovate to the benefit of customers. This would broaden the range of flexible products available, offering both an income for life and the chance to keep increasing the size of their fund.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the state would edge up the retirement age in line with rising longevity, and act as the backstop for the relatively small number of people who run out of money.</p> <p>The chances of this dream scenario materialising seem remote. Auto enrolment has been a sensible initiative, and should help increase national saving. But Britain is a low-wage economy, and the amounts many workers will be putting away are not going to add up to a big pension pot even after 30 or more years of contributions.</p> <p>A second problem is that the pension changes are likely to exacerbate ingrained weaknesses in the UK economy: the reluctance to defer gratification; the over-investment in bricks and mortar; the wealth gap between an asset-rich older generation and an asset-poor younger generation. It is a fair bet that the pension changes will lead to higher investment in buy-to-let properties. If they fall on hard times for any reason, they will expect the state to bail them out. In reality this involves younger workers frozen out of the housing market paying higher taxes. This will not be popular or, given an ageing population, sustainable.</p> <p>Instead, the government will continue pushing up the state retirement age into the low 70s so that the burden on taxpayers doesn't become too acute. This may seem reasonable in Guildford in Surrey, where male life expectancy at birth is 82; less attractive in Glasgow, where it is 72. Nor is right that those doing physically demanding jobs should carry on working into their 70s.</p> <p>So, Groves is almost certainly right. This can only avoid ending in tears if retirees use their pension pots to generate higher incomes than they do currently. It is hard to see how spending it on sports cars, holidays and even buy-to-let homes will do this.</p> <p>At some point Britain will think again&#xa0;about whether to return to some form of compulsory annuities. Interestingly, Australia is having that debate right now.</p>",

Instead you\u2019ll see one or two perfect suggestions that perfectly capture what you want to watch right now depending on your mood and who is with you, who is sitting with you at the TV right now. I think this version is possible.\u201d </p> <p>The traditional TV, or \"linear TV\" as Hunt refers to it, is limited by the 24-hour grid based on which it plans its programming, which creates a tyranny from shows seen as popular. <br></p> <p>The limitations of such a model have often led to demise of shows with niche appeal or cult-like following. Such shows, while failing to attract enough viewers to secure a second or third season on network television, have found many fans when streamed online \u2013 think Firefly, <a href=\"http://www.telegram.com/article/20140401/COLUMN86/304019657&amp;Template=printart\">which was the subject of Neflix\u2019s April\u2019s Fool prank this year</a>, or Arrested Development, which was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/feb/26/arrested-development-one-season-netflix\">revived by Netflix last year for a fourth season</a>.</p> <p>Netflix sees itself as a way to restore television justice, Hunt suggests. </p> <p>\u201cCommon criticism I hear is that we carry a lot of old shows, some call them junk. But I have a different perspective. There are no bad shows, but there are many shows with small and devoted audiences,\u201d explained Hunt. \u201cAnd internet TV, not subject to the tyranny of the grid, can afford to carry those small shows.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a4ea2ef0-0f9f-481a-8d2c-d22ced3d58f4\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/29/1401392110238/5ade0218-574b-49c6-9b93-da8f40602ca8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"arrested development will arnett gob michael bluth jason bateman\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hunt seems to argue that 'linear TV' is, like GOB of Arrested Development, struggling to shed certain illusions.

Hastings noted that David Fincher, who helped direct the first season of House of Cards, did not want to know that number of users turned off the show after Frank Underwood's character strangles a dog. Instead of using data to determine how its series' characters should behave or whether they should live or die, Netflix uses its data to determine which users it should promote its content to.</p> <p>The flexibility of internet TV doesn\u2019t just open the doors to more diverse programming, but also to the way that the stories are told in terms of length and languages. <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/how-lilyhammer-changed-the-tv-world-20131205\">The first of Netflix' original series, Lilyhammer</a>, was released in Norway in 2012 and much of it is in Norwegian.</p> <p>Expect a more global feel. Recently, Netflix announced that it was expanding into<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/21/netflix-launch-european-countries-tv-film-streaming\"> six more European countries</a>. <br></p> <p>Yet even as the company embarks on the mission to change the way people watch TV around the world, it's facing a war back in the US. At home, Netflix is currently battling the internet service providers over net neutrality - the access to their cable bandwidth, necessary in order to stream its contents to the subscribers.</p> <p>\u201cWe would rather beat our internet TV competitors by providing superior service than by being the biggest one who can afford to pay the bills that internet service providers would like to charge,\u201d Hunt said on the topic of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/14/net-neutrality-fcc-what-is-it\">net neutrality</a>.<b><br></b></p> <p>We caught up with Hunt to talk about his management experience, Netflix\u2019s stance on the issue of net neutrality, the future of internet TV, and why Netflix subscribers shouldn't feel guilty about binge-watching their favorite shows. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://internetweekny.com/page/EVOLVEMEDIAMon\" data-alt=\"US Money Global Edge Neil Hunt internet week netflix\">  <iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/95311558\" width=\"460\" height=\"281\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Neil Hunt's keynote speech at 2014 Internet Week in New York City. </figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>What piece of advice would you give someone based on your experience?</b><br></p> <p>Hire fully grown adults and treat them as adults.</p> <p><b>Has your role at Netflix changed over the years as the company has grown?</b></p> <p>Well, it's hard to go from a startup with 20, 30 people in it to an organization that has over a thousand people in it without learning a lot of stuff along the way. Certainly, the Netflix culture that has been widely discussed and written about has been a product of trying to understand what it would take to grow without losing the nimbleness and effectiveness that characterized the early years of Netflix. <br></p> <p>And so, the idea behind \"performance culture\" [and] \"freedom and responsibility\" \u2013 both of those concepts came out of a lot of debate and the early 2000s as we were scaling and growing. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664?ref=http://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr/ar/1\" data-alt=\"US Money Netflix culture deck\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/1798664\" width=\"427\" height=\"356\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px 1px 0; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <figcaption>Sheryl Sandberg previously referred to the 'Netflix Culture: Freedom and Responsibility' PowerPoint deck as one of the most important documents ever to come out of Silicon Valley. </figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>You're the head of product at Netflix. Clearly, the product has changed quite a bit since 1997, when it started as a DVD distribution company. Where is the product going next?</b></p> <p>The shift from DVD to streaming began in about 2007 and accelerated in 2011 and at this point is essentially accomplished as far as I can see. It feels fairly straightforward and simple. It's just a substitution of a different delivery vehicle, but actually there's more to it than that.</p> <p>The proposition that we offered to the customers of our DVD service was a proposition to be able to get any DVD \u2013 essentially any DVD that was released \u2013 but with limits of the postal service delays and so on and so forth. The typical subscriber would consume two or three DVDs a month. <br></p> <p>That's a very different proposition from today in the streaming world, where we don't seek to carry everything. We seek to carry the compelling library of content that's available immediately as much as people want to watch. A typical subscriber today is watching 30 to 40 hours a month of Netflix content. That's a huge shift upwards and, of course, the DVD and the streaming plans are both essentially the same price \u2013 $8 or $9.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a668cdb5-308d-4a5d-9957-1798d3668f3b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/29/1401393834043/6db567e7-9ac9-4fbb-825f-0f30cb4b81f2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Orange is the New Black\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor Schilling as Piper Chapman in Orange is the New Black. Photograph: Jessica Miglio/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That fact that there's so much more available on the streaming plan is really quite a different proposition. That leads to a lot of technology changes along the way. <br></p> <p>The one that I like to point to is the queue, which DVD users would remember as being the queue of the DVDs they want shipped to them in the order that they wanted to receive them. That worked well for the DVD business, but we were not sufficiently thoughtful as we brought that to the streaming world. And the idea of an ordered list of titles that you would want to watch doesn't really make sense when you can pick anything right now and watch it.</p> <p>It makes much more sense to think about it as an un-ordered collection of titles you want to see, where Netflix can apply the personalization, the recommendations algorythms that we spent a lot of time and effort [developing] to pick out from the un-ordered list the set of titles that would be interesting. That actually makes the queue become My List, which becomes a dramatically more powerful vehicle. A simple change, but lot more power comes out of it.</p> <p><b>It seems that Netflix appeals to a variety of demographics \u2013 parents with kids that need to be entertained, teens, couples, truckers who use it to pass the time while stuck at a truck stop. Who would you say are your users? </b></p> <p>We have consciously reached out to try to provide a service for people who love it, anyone of any different description of variety. I like to think that where as all television might have dealt with channels and there would be a handful of channels that a teen would watch and then channels that your father would watch. </p> <p>At Netflix, we think to provide 48m different channels for 48 million different subscribers. And we use all of our personalization technology to look to understand the taste and interests of each of those different customers and then to match that up against everything we know about our content. So \"recommendations and suggestions\" sounds too straight forward, but essentially the selection of content that your son would see on his home screen is very different from the selection from the content that your father would see according to how different their tastes are.</p> <p>It's not like we are trying to force a particular choice on each of those consumers, we are trying to make sure they have acceptable choices at their fingertips, the choices that appeal to them. That's really what's it all about. It really is about trying to have a separate, distinct channel for each customer. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0003b081-afd5-4979-ad26-018a3ad25f25\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/27/1401201334309/b277f7d3-3966-4b55-80e9-96a26524657b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"US Money Global Edge Netflix House of Cards\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Fincher says he tried to create Kevin Spacey's character without regard to audience preferences.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>Speaking of recommendations, I'm a huge fan of House of Cards. How do these original shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black play into your bigger goal?</b></p> <p>I think we are going to end up doing a lot more originals over time.</p> <p>The world of internet TV kind of means that not all shows have to be 13 episodes times 42 minutes. That's a new freedom \u2013 the idea that a story can have long segments and short segments and that you don't have to end each 42-minute segment with a tidbit of the next one because you know that people are going to be watching several in the row. The freedom is really that we get to develop by working directly with the producer and the team to cross new kinds of storytelling. The best way to do that is to do it ourselves, to do our own original work and really have the agenda for how that moves forward.</p> <p>When you look at House of Cards and Orange is the New Black and several others of the originals, you will see that the storytelling is deeper and richer, but I think we have a ways to go. We haven't yet cracked the idea that the episodes all need to be 42 minutes long. <br></p> <p>So the idea is maybe you have a 15-minute episode and maybe you have a 19-minute episode with a break in the middle. And that's fine. Chapters in a book are a different length. And so I think as we do more and more work in the space, and as we have more and more rights to the content we will need to syndicate it out for getting exposure on more conventional linear television, we will have more and more freedom to change the format going forward.</p> <p><b>Netflix has taken TV marathons and binge watching to a whole new level. I myself am guilty of it quite often. Do you find it interesting or amusing how Netflix has changed the way that people watch a show?</b></p> <p>Binge watching \u2026 that term carries some connotations of guilt, which you echo.</p> <p>You know, I don't think anyone would say that reading two chapters of a book in a row is binge reading. It's just a natural way to consume the story. If you get into it, you want to get on and see how it develops and unfolds.</p> <p>It also gives us interesting opportunity to do <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Netflix-Spoiler-Ad-Advises-Viewers-Watch-Responsibly-52300.html\">a marketing campaign around watching responsibly</a>. I think it's just a great natural way for people to engage with a compelling story. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQldnFX_uOQ\" data-alt=\"US Money Global Edge Netflix ad\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/qQldnFX_uOQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>A 2013 Netflix ad warned subscribers to 'Watch responsibly.'</figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>Let's talk about developing product with input from the consumer. What's the role of the subscribers in building out Netflix? How do you usually interact with them?</b></p> <p>Well, we are a very data-driven culture. We love to use A/B testing. If we have an idea we like to build most of it, then put it in front of a lot of people, maybe half a million people. <br></p> <p>As a person uses the product, see if it behaves, we see if it works better, see if customers watch longer or retain better with the new version of the product that we have built. That's worked pretty well.</p> <p>And of course, the ideas that we have put into tests don't come out of thin air. They often come out of customers' suggestions. They come out of focus groups and quantitative sessions where we watch customers interact with our products and we talk with them. <br></p> <p>We do a lot of that kind of work, too. We try to be very responsive to what people actually want \u2013 what will generate more viewing hours, more retention, more engagement with the server. Whatever we can do to advance that movement forward, that's what we will seek to do. <br></p> <p><b>We have been hearing a lot about net neutrality. A lot of it, however, seems to be removed from the actual consumer. Has there been any communication between your subscribers and Netflix? Have they expressed any concern on the issue?</b></p> <p>I don't think customers care or necessarily should care too much about the details of net neutrality, but they should care about the outcome.</p> <p>The issue at stake here is \u2013 the number you hear bandied around here a lot is that Netflix represents a third of the internet. That's sort of missing the point. The bottom line is the average Netflix stream is two megabits-a-second, where what consumers are paying for is 10 or 20 megabits-a-second. And so it's not really a third of the internet traffic, it's actually about 10% of what you've already paid for. Essentially, if the internet service provider wants to charge the providers like Netflix for the right to provide the traffic or for the right to give the internet service provider the traffic that their customers have requested and paid for, feels like double dipping. That's our statement so far.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-802e188c-4c04-4c2d-a35d-a5be790ca7a8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/29/1401394283362/e50d8720-f18b-4473-aa45-c66af55c34ba-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Activist Kevin Zeese is pulled away as he protests during an open meeting on internet regulation.  net neutrality\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An activist is pulled away as he protests during an open meeting on internet regulation. Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If it were a competitive market, if there were several different internet service providers serving you, the customer, and some could offer net neutrality and some not, then the market would discipline the internet service providers that under-provide it, or overcharge, and we would have fair price set for what it takes to exchange the bits. </p> <p>But the reality in this country is that we don't really have competition for which cable provider you really get your broadband from. That leads to a situation where that broadband provider can pretty much charge whatever they want for the internet connection with no constraint. We don't think that's a realistic model.</p> <p>We think the right outcome here is for a place where internet service provider gets to take the bits to its edge network at no cost and where Netflix pays to bring the bits all the way up. So typically the bits that flow to you may only flow three or five miles from our service to your house. </p> <p>We think that's the service that you have paid for with your $80 or $90 a month paid to the internet service provider and that we should get to give those bits to the internet service provider at no charge and they should deliver them with the equal priority across all the different services. So no fast lane, but equally no penalization. That seems like a fair outcome to us.</p> <p>So that's what we are arguing for as a strong net neutrality condition. It's interesting to see how this shapes out, but certainly I am not a great fan of what I understand of the current FTC proposed rulemaking in terms and conditions. I think we have some work to do.</p> <p>The key observation is that in UK there really are competitive internet providers. It's really interesting to us that when we offered to bring Netflix bits directly to wherever the internet provider wants to take them, they are only too eager to embrace and bring them into the network for no charge. So the only place in the world where there is an anti-connect charge discussion is where the broadband provider is not in a particularly competitive market. </p> <p><b>Where do you see Netflix going in the next few years? </b></p> <p>There's a lot more people in the world who are enthusiastic about internet TV and we have ambitions to take our original shows and other signature great shows we licensed across the world, country by country, region by region. I think that's a very exciting growth opportunity in front of us and we don't need to invent new businesses, we just need to deliver the business that we are working on as widely as possible. <br></p>",

Instead you\u2019ll see one or two perfect suggestions that perfectly capture what you want to watch right now depending on your mood and who is with you, who is sitting with you at the TV right now. I think this version is possible.\u201d The traditional TV, or \"linear TV\" as Hunt refers to it, is limited by the 24-hour grid based on which it plans its programming, which creates a tyranny from shows seen as popular. The limitations of such a model have often led to demise of shows with niche appeal or cult-like following. Such shows, while failing to attract enough viewers to secure a second or third season on network television, have found many fans when streamed online \u2013 think Firefly, which was the subject of Neflix\u2019s April\u2019s Fool prank this year, or Arrested Development, which was revived by Netflix last year for a fourth season. Netflix sees itself as a way to restore television justice, Hunt suggests. \u201cCommon criticism I hear is that we carry a lot of old shows, some call them junk. But I have a different perspective. There are no bad shows, but there are many shows with small and devoted audiences,\u201d explained Hunt. \u201cAnd internet TV, not subject to the tyranny of the grid, can afford to carry those small shows.\u201d While speaking at the Code Conference earlier this week, Reed Hastings, Netflix co-founder and CEO, said that Netflix will not use data to influence its original content. Hastings noted that David Fincher, who helped direct the first season of House of Cards, did not want to know that number of users turned off the show after Frank Underwood's character strangles a dog. Instead of using data to determine how its series' characters should behave or whether they should live or die, Netflix uses its data to determine which users it should promote its content to. The flexibility of internet TV doesn\u2019t just open the doors to more diverse programming, but also to the way that the stories are told in terms of length and languages. The first of Netflix' original series, Lilyhammer, was released in Norway in 2012 and much of it is in Norwegian. Expect a more global feel. Recently, Netflix announced that it was expanding into six more European countries. Yet even as the company embarks on the mission to change the way people watch TV around the world, it's facing a war back in the US. At home, Netflix is currently battling the internet service providers over net neutrality - the access to their cable bandwidth, necessary in order to stream its contents to the subscribers. \u201cWe would rather beat our internet TV competitors by providing superior service than by being the biggest one who can afford to pay the bills that internet service providers would like to charge,\u201d Hunt said on the topic of net neutrality. We caught up with Hunt to talk about his management experience, Netflix\u2019s stance on the issue of net neutrality, the future of internet TV, and why Netflix subscribers shouldn't feel guilty about binge-watching their favorite shows. What piece of advice would you give someone based on your experience? Hire fully grown adults and treat them as adults. Has your role at Netflix changed over the years as the company has grown? Well, it's hard to go from a startup with 20, 30 people in it to an organization that has over a thousand people in it without learning a lot of stuff along the way. Certainly, the Netflix culture that has been widely discussed and written about has been a product of trying to understand what it would take to grow without losing the nimbleness and effectiveness that characterized the early years of Netflix. And so, the idea behind \"performance culture\" [and] \"freedom and responsibility\" \u2013 both of those concepts came out of a lot of debate and the early 2000s as we were scaling and growing. You're the head of product at Netflix. Clearly, the product has changed quite a bit since 1997, when it started as a DVD distribution company. Where is the product going next? The shift from DVD to streaming began in about 2007 and accelerated in 2011 and at this point is essentially accomplished as far as I can see. It feels fairly straightforward and simple. It's just a substitution of a different delivery vehicle, but actually there's more to it than that. The proposition that we offered to the customers of our DVD service was a proposition to be able to get any DVD \u2013 essentially any DVD that was released \u2013 but with limits of the postal service delays and so on and so forth. The typical subscriber would consume two or three DVDs a month. That's a very different proposition from today in the streaming world, where we don't seek to carry everything. We seek to carry the compelling library of content that's available immediately as much as people want to watch. A typical subscriber today is watching 30 to 40 hours a month of Netflix content. That's a huge shift upwards and, of course, the DVD and the streaming plans are both essentially the same price \u2013 $8 or $9. That fact that there's so much more available on the streaming plan is really quite a different proposition. That leads to a lot of technology changes along the way. The one that I like to point to is the queue, which DVD users would remember as being the queue of the DVDs they want shipped to them in the order that they wanted to receive them. That worked well for the DVD business, but we were not sufficiently thoughtful as we brought that to the streaming world. And the idea of an ordered list of titles that you would want to watch doesn't really make sense when you can pick anything right now and watch it. It makes much more sense to think about it as an un-ordered collection of titles you want to see, where Netflix can apply the personalization, the recommendations algorythms that we spent a lot of time and effort [developing] to pick out from the un-ordered list the set of titles that would be interesting. That actually makes the queue become My List, which becomes a dramatically more powerful vehicle. A simple change, but lot more power comes out of it. It seems that Netflix appeals to a variety of demographics \u2013 parents with kids that need to be entertained, teens, couples, truckers who use it to pass the time while stuck at a truck stop. Who would you say are your users? We have consciously reached out to try to provide a service for people who love it, anyone of any different description of variety. I like to think that where as all television might have dealt with channels and there would be a handful of channels that a teen would watch and then channels that your father would watch. At Netflix, we think to provide 48m different channels for 48 million different subscribers. And we use all of our personalization technology to look to understand the taste and interests of each of those different customers and then to match that up against everything we know about our content. So \"recommendations and suggestions\" sounds too straight forward, but essentially the selection of content that your son would see on his home screen is very different from the selection from the content that your father would see according to how different their tastes are. It's not like we are trying to force a particular choice on each of those consumers, we are trying to make sure they have acceptable choices at their fingertips, the choices that appeal to them. That's really what's it all about. It really is about trying to have a separate, distinct channel for each customer. Speaking of recommendations, I'm a huge fan of House of Cards. How do these original shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black play into your bigger goal? I think we are going to end up doing a lot more originals over time. The world of internet TV kind of means that not all shows have to be 13 episodes times 42 minutes. That's a new freedom \u2013 the idea that a story can have long segments and short segments and that you don't have to end each 42-minute segment with a tidbit of the next one because you know that people are going to be watching several in the row. The freedom is really that we get to develop by working directly with the producer and the team to cross new kinds of storytelling. The best way to do that is to do it ourselves, to do our own original work and really have the agenda for how that moves forward. When you look at House of Cards and Orange is the New Black and several others of the originals, you will see that the storytelling is deeper and richer, but I think we have a ways to go. We haven't yet cracked the idea that the episodes all need to be 42 minutes long. So the idea is maybe you have a 15-minute episode and maybe you have a 19-minute episode with a break in the middle. And that's fine. Chapters in a book are a different length. And so I think as we do more and more work in the space, and as we have more and more rights to the content we will need to syndicate it out for getting exposure on more conventional linear television, we will have more and more freedom to change the format going forward. Netflix has taken TV marathons and binge watching to a whole new level. I myself am guilty of it quite often. Do you find it interesting or amusing how Netflix has changed the way that people watch a show? Binge watching \u2026 that term carries some connotations of guilt, which you echo. You know, I don't think anyone would say that reading two chapters of a book in a row is binge reading. It's just a natural way to consume the story. If you get into it, you want to get on and see how it develops and unfolds. It also gives us interesting opportunity to do a marketing campaign around watching responsibly. I think it's just a great natural way for people to engage with a compelling story. Let's talk about developing product with input from the consumer. What's the role of the subscribers in building out Netflix? How do you usually interact with them? Well, we are a very data-driven culture. We love to use A/B testing. If we have an idea we like to build most of it, then put it in front of a lot of people, maybe half a million people. As a person uses the product, see if it behaves, we see if it works better, see if customers watch longer or retain better with the new version of the product that we have built. That's worked pretty well. And of course, the ideas that we have put into tests don't come out of thin air. They often come out of customers' suggestions. They come out of focus groups and quantitative sessions where we watch customers interact with our products and we talk with them. We do a lot of that kind of work, too. We try to be very responsive to what people actually want \u2013 what will generate more viewing hours, more retention, more engagement with the server. Whatever we can do to advance that movement forward, that's what we will seek to do. We have been hearing a lot about net neutrality. A lot of it, however, seems to be removed from the actual consumer. Has there been any communication between your subscribers and Netflix? Have they expressed any concern on the issue? I don't think customers care or necessarily should care too much about the details of net neutrality, but they should care about the outcome. The issue at stake here is \u2013 the number you hear bandied around here a lot is that Netflix represents a third of the internet. That's sort of missing the point. The bottom line is the average Netflix stream is two megabits-a-second, where what consumers are paying for is 10 or 20 megabits-a-second. And so it's not really a third of the internet traffic, it's actually about 10% of what you've already paid for. Essentially, if the internet service provider wants to charge the providers like Netflix for the right to provide the traffic or for the right to give the internet service provider the traffic that their customers have requested and paid for, feels like double dipping. That's our statement so far. If it were a competitive market, if there were several different internet service providers serving you, the customer, and some could offer net neutrality and some not, then the market would discipline the internet service providers that under-provide it, or overcharge, and we would have fair price set for what it takes to exchange the bits. But the reality in this country is that we don't really have competition for which cable provider you really get your broadband from. That leads to a situation where that broadband provider can pretty much charge whatever they want for the internet connection with no constraint. We don't think that's a realistic model. We think the right outcome here is for a place where internet service provider gets to take the bits to its edge network at no cost and where Netflix pays to bring the bits all the way up. So typically the bits that flow to you may only flow three or five miles from our service to your house. We think that's the service that you have paid for with your $80 or $90 a month paid to the internet service provider and that we should get to give those bits to the internet service provider at no charge and they should deliver them with the equal priority across all the different services. So no fast lane, but equally no penalization. That seems like a fair outcome to us. So that's what we are arguing for as a strong net neutrality condition. It's interesting to see how this shapes out, but certainly I am not a great fan of what I understand of the current FTC proposed rulemaking in terms and conditions. I think we have some work to do. The key observation is that in UK there really are competitive internet providers. It's really interesting to us that when we offered to bring Netflix bits directly to wherever the internet provider wants to take them, they are only too eager to embrace and bring them into the network for no charge. So the only place in the world where there is an anti-connect charge discussion is where the broadband provider is not in a particularly competitive market. Where do you see Netflix going in the next few years? There's a lot more people in the world who are enthusiastic about internet TV and we have ambitions to take our original shows and other signature great shows we licensed across the world, country by country, region by region. I think that's a very exciting growth opportunity in front of us and we don't need to invent new businesses, we just need to deliver the business that we are working on as widely as possible.",
