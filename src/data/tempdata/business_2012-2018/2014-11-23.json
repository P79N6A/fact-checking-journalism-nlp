      "bodyText": "Almost half of UK businesses employ migrant workers, saying there is a lack of local talent and that staff from overseas have a more positive work ethic, according to a report by the British Chambers of Commerce. Forty five percent of UK firms hire migrants from within and outside the EU, the BCC\u2019s 2014 workforce survey found. John Longworth, director general of the lobby group, said that while companies were concerned about the level of unemployment in the UK, particularly among the young, they struggled to find UK workers with the right skills. \u201cBusinesses continue to rely on migrant workers, because they can\u2019t find enough suitable talent locally. Nearly half of businesses are hiring migrant workers, as they believe that they are more suited to roles than UK workers, have a more positive work ethic and better experience and qualifications.\u201d The trend for companies to recruit overseas caused a political row recently when Northamptonshire sandwich-maker Greencore was accused of ignoring locals who wanted work, recruiting instead in Hungary. One Coventry-based company, Squires Gear and Engineering told the BCC that migrant workers from Eastern Europe tend to have a good work ethic, have little or no time off sick, and pick up new skills quickly. The family-run business, which is an equal opportunities employer, has historically employed a mix of British and migrant workers, in particular Polish engineers. Squires believes that schools should work more closely with businesses to understand what it is they want from school leavers. Companies should also take responsibility for equipping workers with more skills, Squires said. Longworth said more needed to be done to improve the prospects of young people in the UK, giving them the skills they needed to compete more effectively in Britain\u2019s jobs market. \u201cThe long-term sustainable growth of the UK relies on all of the UK feeling the benefit of a \u2018good economy\u2019, not just the skilled and high-paid earners. It\u2019s therefore important that we focus on improving the skills of the young to meet demand. The job of businesses, in partnership with educators, and parents too, is to give our youth the right skills and work ethic to compete with the best in the world.\u201d According to the BCC, almost nine in 10 firms hiring migrant workers said they made up a relatively small proportion of the workforce, with three-quarters or more of their staff UK residents. Twelve per cent of businesses said EU migrants made up more than 10% of their workforce, and 4% said non-EU migrants accounted for more than 10% of staff. Firms operating in the catering and accommodation sector were most likely to hire migrants, with 70% reporting that they did. Professional and businesses services companies, and those operating in the media and creative sector, were least likely to hire workers from outside the UK. The BCC said policy changes were needed, including a business governor in every school to increase business engagement in education. Longworth said that UK firms are aware of public perceptions around immigration, \u201csuch as the belief that porous borders put downward pressure on wages\u201d. However, only 4% of companies cited a reduced wage bill as motivation for employing migrant workers.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Looking out of the south-east-facing windows from the lobby of San Francisco\u2019s hip downtown W hotel, you would be forgiven for thinking the view looks subtly different from what you would expect to see through normal glass. The luxury high-rise hotel, which claim rooms to be \u201cgreen 24/7\u201d, uses \u201csmart\u201d glass that can be tinted to different settings throughout the day to regulate the amount of heat and light coming through, protecting the customers from the glare of the sun while they are sitting in one of the high-backed couches of the chic establishment. Just over 45 miles south is Silicon Valley, the home of View, the company making the glass that can be controlled from a smartphone to darken or lighten a window, a technology that promises in many cases to do away with the need for curtains and blinds and save significant amounts of energy spent on cooling. With more than $300m (\u00a3190m) in investment, the company is one of a number of players trying to bring to reality a new era of glass, hoping to make it standard first in offices, later in homes \u2013 and as a result tap into the billions spent every year on windows for both new constructions and retrofitting existing buildings. Developments have been rapid in the six years since Rao Mulpuri joined View as chief executive. In that time the idea of glass which can change tint - similar to some rearview mirrors in cars and sunglasses - has been scaled up to the extent that the glass can line the front of hospitals and schools. \u201cFrankly, I gave it about a 10% chance of success [when I joined]. And that was high enough for me. I thought the technology needed to be developed further,\u201d Mulpuri recalled. \u201cThere was a lot of work to be done. And there were enough risks to take it to commercial scale that you could put all of that in that 90% category. \u201cA month into my job, I was completely wrong. It had about a zero percent chance of success. The designs and the materials the company was using at the time were not durable, were not scaleable so we essentially did a restart at that point.\u201d Out of that restart came the company\u2019s \u2018Dynamic Glass\u2019 which can progress through four different levels of tinted shade depending on how strongly the sun is shining, or remain fully clear. This is achieved through electrochromic technology - using materials which change colour when an electrical charge is applied. The View panels consist of one piece of glass treated with an electrochromic metal oxide coating, which is one fiftieth the thickness of a human hair \u2013 this is then sealed with another one or two panes of glass. Also in the glass unit is a low voltage wire connected to thin strips similar to those that heat the rear windshield of a car, which conduct electricity and change the state of the glass through its four different stages of tint, depending on how much voltage is applied. After two years in the market, View has completed 120 projects, mostly in North America, with a handful in Germany from schools and universities to hospitals and some private homes. When in use the glass tint can control the amount of light and heat that gets into the building while at the same time remaining transparent. Windows can be grouped into different zones - such as north, south, east and west - which can be controlled together as the sun exposure varies. The price of the bespoke \u2018smart\u2019 glass can be between five and six times that of a normal piece of glass but ends up at equal cost or with a 1% premium in a fully finished building, according to Mulpuri, an engineer by background who grew up in India. Savings on lighting, electricity, heating, ventilation and air conditioning can amount to 23% at peak times, the company says. Mulpuri, who after arriving in the US in the late 1980s worked for 11 years in the semiconductor industry, bemoans the building industry\u2019s reliance on energy-hungry ways of controlling temperature. \u201cWith the advent of air conditioning, we found ways to take the heat out so we found ways to make the windows bigger so we still have the view, and when there is too much light we kept closing it up - and using big air conditioning systems to take the heat out,\u201d he said. Most of View\u2019s projects so far have been for commercial buildings with the company also pushing the health and wellbeing benefits. Research claiming that hospital patients in a \u201cday-lit\u201d room recover up to 20% quicker \u2013 and thus spend less time on the wards \u2013 is cited along with statistics that students in rooms with more daylight are faster with maths and reading. Future plans are to move into the residential market as some high-end homeowners are willing to pay for their coastal homes looking onto the sea. \u201cThey are paying for the views and then closing the blinds all day,\u201d said Mulpuri. There are about six other companies working to bring the technology to scale, he said, in a sector where there is room for a number of players, amongst them SageGlass from Minnesota, owned by the French building materials group Saint Gobain. Mulpuri told Forbes magazine that about 25bn square feet of glass a year are used for architectural purposes and even if only a portion of that market switches to dynamic glass that ultimately results in a market size of $100bn. The main hurdle, he said, is not competition but entrenched attitudes in an area which is not known for embracing rapid change. \u201cOur \u2018competition\u2019 is risk aversion. People saying \u2018great technology, I will do it in my next building\u2019 is the most common reason we get a \u2018no\u2019 because people are afraid of the change and nobody ever gets fired for using regular windows with blinds and shades because that is what the rest of the town is doing,\u201d he said. Another stumbling block comes in existing windows and blinds in that they form an accepted part of the interior decoration of most homes and offices. \u201cIf you love them keep them. To control glare, use my product,\u201d said Mulpuri. \u201cWe wear clothes a certain way. It is not always the most efficient piece of clothing and we think the same is true here.\u201d Europe, he expects, will be receptive to the glass as attitudes are more orientated towards conservation and regulations are more in favour of energy efficiency, while the technology has other possible uses in transport and electronics.",

The designs and the materials the company was using at the time were not durable, were not scaleable so we essentially did a restart at that point.\u201d</p> <p>Out of that restart came the company\u2019s \u2018Dynamic Glass\u2019 which can progress through four different levels of tinted shade depending on how strongly the sun is shining, or remain fully clear.</p> <p>This is achieved through electrochromic technology - using materials which change colour when an electrical charge is applied. The View panels consist of one piece of glass treated with an electrochromic metal oxide coating, which is one fiftieth the thickness of a human hair \u2013 this is then sealed with another one or two panes of glass.</p> <p>Also in the glass unit is a low voltage wire connected to thin strips similar to those that heat the rear windshield of a car, which conduct electricity and change the state of the glass through its four different stages of tint, depending on how much voltage is applied.</p> <p>After two years in the market, View has completed 120 projects, mostly in North America, with a handful in Germany from schools and universities to hospitals and some private homes.</p> <p>When in use the glass tint can control the amount of light and heat that gets into the building while at the same time remaining transparent. Windows can be grouped into different zones - such as north, south, east and west - which can be controlled together as the sun exposure varies.</p> <p>The price of the bespoke \u2018smart\u2019 glass can be between five and six times that of a normal piece of glass but ends up at equal cost or with a 1% premium in a fully finished building, according to Mulpuri, an engineer by background who grew up in India. Savings on lighting, electricity, heating, ventilation and air conditioning can amount to 23% at peak times, the company says.</p> <p>Mulpuri, who after arriving in the US in the late 1980s worked for 11 years in the semiconductor industry, bemoans the building industry\u2019s reliance on energy-hungry ways of controlling temperature.</p> <p>\u201cWith the advent of air conditioning, we found ways to take the heat out so we found ways to make the windows bigger so we still have the view, and when there is too much light we kept closing it up - and using big air conditioning systems to take the heat out,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Most of View\u2019s projects so far have been for commercial buildings with the company also pushing the health and wellbeing benefits. Research claiming that hospital patients in a \u201cday-lit\u201d room recover up to 20% quicker \u2013 and thus spend less time on the wards \u2013 is cited along with statistics that students in rooms with more daylight are faster with maths and reading.</p> <p>Future plans are to move into the residential market as some high-end homeowners are willing to pay for their coastal homes looking onto the sea. \u201cThey are paying for the views and then closing the blinds all day,\u201d said Mulpuri.</p> <p>There are about six other companies working to bring the technology to scale, he said, in a sector where there is room for a number of players, amongst them SageGlass from Minnesota, owned by the French building materials group Saint Gobain.</p> <p>Mulpuri told Forbes magazine that about 25bn square feet of glass a year are used for architectural purposes and even if only a portion of that market switches to dynamic glass that ultimately results in a market size of $100bn.</p> <p>The main hurdle, he said, is not competition but entrenched attitudes in an area which is not known for embracing rapid change.</p> <p>\u201cOur \u2018competition\u2019 is risk aversion. People saying \u2018great technology, I will do it in my next building\u2019 is the most common reason we get a \u2018no\u2019 because people are afraid of the change and nobody ever gets fired for using regular windows with blinds and shades because that is what the rest of the town is doing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Another stumbling block comes in existing windows and blinds in that they form an accepted part of the interior decoration of most homes and offices. \u201cIf you love them keep them. To control glare, use my product,\u201d said Mulpuri. \u201cWe wear clothes a certain way. It is not always the most efficient piece of clothing and we think the same is true here.\u201d</p> <p>Europe, he expects, will be receptive to the glass as attitudes are more orientated towards conservation and regulations are more in favour of energy efficiency, while the technology has other possible uses in transport and electronics.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The interest rate cut in China that came at the end of last week could be another red warning light flashing on David Cameron\u2019s global economy \u201cdashboard\u201d. Or the cheaper cost of credit in Beijing could provide a much-needed boost for the world\u2019s second-largest economy following months of slowing output. Likewise, a snap election in Japan, called by prime minister Shinzo Abe during the week, could illustrate panic in the world\u2019s third-largest economy after two decades of stagnation, or be a sensible way to prepare the ground for a second and decisive stage of his Abenomics. On his return from the G20 in Brisbane, Cameron appeared in the gloomiest of moods, highlighting how slowing growth in emerging markets, of which China is the biggest, and stagnation in Europe were threats to the stability of the global financial system alongside the escalating dispute over eastern Ukraine and the Ebola crisis. We have been here before. Cameron\u2019s comments echo those of George Soros the last time there was a sense of gathering doom. The billionaire financier said in 2011: \u201cFinancial markets are driving the world towards another Great Depression with incalculable political consequences. The authorities, particularly in Europe, have lost control of the situation.\u201d Back then the world\u2019s central banks came to the rescue. The US Federal Reserve began pumping funds into the financial system at such a rate that its total contribution was soon to reach nearly $4 trillion. The Bank of England and Japan\u2019s central bank joined the fight. The only major institution to stay away was the European Central Bank (ECB), which was blocked by politicians in Brussels and Berlin from joining the quantitative easing game. They preferred prayer to action. ECB boss Mario Draghi was only allowed to issue a promise that he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. This promise, made in the summer of 2012, stemmed the flow of funds out of the eurozone, but only delayed a reckoning. Now he must honour the promise and begin buying sovereign bonds under his own QE programme. Last week he hinted that that was imminent. Not that Draghi has the power to cleanse the system. Cameron\u2019s red lights are still everywhere. The Ukraine conflict is hurting Russia and its satellites. Germany and the eastern side of Europe, which has substantial trade links with Russia, are suffering too. Even bright spots like Spain are enjoying what could be likened to a fake tan \u2013 a gloss easily washed away in the event of an economic storm. The US is the only safe haven. A simplistic measure of its current situation would declare President Obama\u2019s Keynesian policies a success. The dollar is rising against nearly all currencies as investors get their gold bars out, ready to cash them in for a chance to back the US recovery. A rising currency is a sure sign of returning confidence and the US, which could soon be putting up interest rates, has it in spades. However, the US has its weak spots, not least a banking sector that is getting up to its old tricks, a household sector that is ramping up its borrowing again and a political system riven with conflict. Much of its recovery is going in profits to the super-rich, stoking up social problems in riot-torn Ferguson, Missouri and elsewhere. Which brings us back to Cameron. In last weekend\u2019s downbeat memo, he depicted the UK as a bright spot, not a red light. Yet his support for austerity has discouraged public and private investment and turned what should have been sustainable momentum into a sugar-rush of activity fuelled by low-skilled and low-paid workers. Sustainable UK growth is highly dependent on healthy exports. As such it needs greater cooperation through the offices of the G20, not less. Cameron appeared to be happy to end a wholly ineffective summit by saying, in effect, \u201cworld, cure thyself\u201d. Yet as leader of the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy, it will only happen if he participates in creating a new world order. Toxic week for nuclear power The nuclear industry has had a bad week, ending with a report on Friday from the Dounreay plant in the north of Scotland of \u201cunacceptable staff behaviour\u201d and an unauthorised radioactive release. On Wednesday, Areva, the French atomic plant designer and shareholder and atin Hinkley Point C, issued a profit warning and said it might need a cash injection as its shares plunged by nearly a quarter. The day before, EDF, the biggest shareholder and planned operator of Hinkley, admitted that it was once again delaying the schedule on the opening of the Flamanville plant in Normandy. None of this inspires confidence in an industry that is still struggling for public acceptance as work has got under way on the first atomic power plant to be built in Britain for more than two decades. Safety is the ultimate issue, but while the Dounreay episode is deeply regrettable, it appears to have been managed in an appropriate way by the regulators. The Flamanville rescheduling is, in isolation, equally regrettable but not disastrous. EDF insists it is learning from its mistakes, and Areva will not ultimately crash and burn because it is protected by the French state, which is still its major shareholder. Nevertheless, Areva\u2019s problems crystallise a major concern. As well as Flamanville, it is beset by delays at Olkiluoto in Finland, where it is also helping to build one of its European pressurised reactors, similar to the one planned for Hinkley. Areva is also affected by the wider downturn in expected demand for new nuclear plants, and concerns that even the Paris government wants to scale down its dependence on nuclear. All this highlights the huge gamble the British government is taking in backing nuclear power. The subsidies on offer already make Hinkley extremely expensive for consumers, and yet no one can say with any certainty when the first power will eventually be produced. Juncker must go The political classes of Westminster were yet again under attack this week, accused of being irreparably out of touch with the building frustrations of voters in Rochester and Strood at seemingly unchecked EU immigration and the relentless way they had ceded powers to Brussels. Parallels have been drawn with MPs\u2019 apparent collective failure to appreciate Scottish political views highlighted by the independence referendum debate. And it was against this backdrop that a rather desperate European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, chose to repeat his calls for greater EU fiscal integration. The argument was made as the former Luxembourg prime minister faced damning reports about a welter of generous tax deals handed out to multinationals by the Grand Duchy tax department during his long tenure in his home country. These deals have for years helped multinationals avoid tax in other European countries. Juncker insisted there was no \u201cLuxembourg model\u201d for doing deals \u2013 and, even if there had been, he was not its architect. This is just not credible, and for that reason Juncker should go. But in some ways that is regrettable. International cooperation on tax is the only way to rein in big corporations determined to shirk their fair share of tax. Multinationals around the world have seen booming corporate profits in recent decades but are increasingly finding ways to position themselves beyond the taxable reach of nation states. It is a silent scandal. But it is not one that is going to be solved by Britain parting ways with the EU and accelerating its journey towards full tax haven status. Nor would it be helped by Scotland going it alone, equally destined to end up a tax haven. The forces of big business in a globalised economy are more powerful than nation states. We need to wise up to that simple truth and look for the right international platform to counterbalance that shift in power.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank might like to update its website \u2013 specifically, its educational video to teach teenagers about the importance of keeping prices in check. In it, a spotted, fanged, snarling \u201cinflation monster\u201d floods money into the marketplace, making vivid the perils of prices rising too quickly. Near the end of the cartoon a much smaller, smiling, pink creature makes a brief appearance \u2013 the \u201cdeflation monster\u201d. Fear of inflation is understandable in a continent that saw devastating hyperinflation last century \u2013 a shock seen by some as pivotal in the rise of Hitler. But look around the eurozone now and the bigger threat is deflation. Even in the UK, inflation is well below the Bank of England\u2019s target and the central bank expects it to fall further over coming months. Oil prices have been falling, as have other commodity prices. In Britain a supermarket price war is pushing food prices down further still. Wages are barely budging and a price freeze for energy bills should also help to keep inflation low this winter. The Bank fully admits it failed to forecast this significant drop below the government-set 2% target for inflation. Governor Mark Carney used the Bank\u2019s latest forecasts earlier this month to warn of \u201csome pretty big disinflationary forces\u201d, largely coming from abroad. He predicted inflation would fall even further, to below 1% over the next six months. If it does, he will face the unenviable task of being the first governor since BoE independence in 1997 to write a letter to the chancellor explaining why inflation is so low. All of the 14 letters written until now have been because inflation missed the target too far in the other direction, overshooting by more than 1 percentage point. Aside from the awkwardness of the Dear George moment, there are very real reasons why Carney is saying the Bank needs to get inflation back to target. The inflation monster may be scary, but the deflation monster is by no means harmless. Even low inflation can be damaging, particularly if it breeds the expectation that outright deflation will follow. If people expect prices to fall, they are encouraged to hold off spending. Economic stagnation and rising unemployment can follow. For retailers, this is all spelling Christmas doom. Already the runup to the most crucial time of the year for shops is being characterised by a game of chicken. Shoppers are wondering how long they can leave their festive buying in the hope of late bargains. Last week\u2019s official retail sales figures, which measure volume rather than value, painted a picture of lots of shopping but at low prices. Margins are being squeezed and we should not be surprised to see some Christmas casualties on the high street. Low inflation is also a problem for those with debts. Unfortunately, at the moment that means a vast number of households and governments, too. Low inflation makes the value of someone\u2019s debt fall more slowly than they had anticipated. For governments, the income to tackle those debts is dented as tax receipts slow. There is an additional headache for policymakers, as low inflation raises interest rates in real terms. With rates very close to zero already there is little room left for the BoE and its counterparts elsewhere to do much to stimulate inflation. The Bank\u2019s deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe, highlighted this sticky position in a recent speech. While two of his colleagues on the Bank\u2019s nine-strong rate-setting committee have consistently voted to lift rates, Cunliffe is clearly in the holding-off camp. His explanation sums up the trade-off faced by central bankers: \u201cWith the scope for tightening monetary policy substantial, but the scope for loosening it much more limited, the risk of a surprising pick-up in inflationary pressure may be more manageable than the risk of the expansion stalling and inflation dropping further.\u201d Of course, there is a silver lining. As inflation comes down, and the value of money decreases at an ever slower pace, savers and pensioners benefit. Real wages may eventually start to rise, ending the biggest pay squeeze in decades. But is dangerously low inflation really the way we want to achieve real wage growth? That may not be how things play out. In the longer term, inflation could go either way \u2013 the Bank can see arguments to support contrary forecasts, for a fall as well as a rise. It could be that the slack in the economy will be used up faster than it expects and inflation end up going over 2%. At the same time, there is a risk growth might soften more than anticipated and inflation stay below target for longer than expected. With previous forecasting failures at the front of their minds, policymakers are careful not to say which is more likely. That same record on forecasting, and the Bank\u2019s contrition, has been behind a change that is welcome to those of us worrying that the little deflation monster had been forgotten. Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, went so far as to announce a \u201ccultural revolution\u201d at Threadneedle Street last week. He was unveiling plans for future research that \u201cchallenges the policy orthodoxy as often as supports it\u201d. Haldane sees this as a crucial way to ward off the kind of \u201cgroupthink\u201d that led to blind spots among economists and policymakers in the runup to the financial crisis. Let\u2019s hope it heralds more work on falling prices, and gives inflation warriors everywhere something to think about.",

While two of his colleagues on the Bank\u2019s nine-strong rate-setting committee have consistently voted to lift rates, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/28/interest-rates-low-longer-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">Cunliffe is clearly in the holding-off camp</a>.</p> <p>His explanation sums up the trade-off faced by central bankers: \u201cWith the scope for tightening monetary policy substantial, but the scope for loosening it much more limited, the risk of a surprising pick-up in inflationary pressure may be more manageable than the risk of the expansion stalling and inflation dropping further.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, there is a silver lining. As inflation comes down, and the value of money decreases at an ever slower pace, savers and pensioners benefit. Real wages may eventually start to rise, ending the biggest pay squeeze in decades. But is dangerously low inflation really the way we want to achieve real wage growth?</p> <p>That may not be how things play out. In the longer term, inflation could go either way \u2013 the Bank can see arguments to support contrary forecasts, for a fall as well as a rise. It could be that the slack in the economy will be used up faster than it expects and inflation end up going over 2%. At the same time, there is a risk growth might soften more than anticipated and inflation stay below target for longer than expected. With previous forecasting failures at the front of their minds, <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk//publications/minutes/Pages/mpc/pdf/2014/mpc1411.aspx\" title=\"\">policymakers are careful not to say which is more likely</a>.</p> <p>That same record on forecasting, and the Bank\u2019s contrition, has been behind a change that is welcome to those of us worrying that the little deflation monster had been forgotten. Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, went so far as to announce a \u201ccultural revolution\u201d at Threadneedle Street last week. He was <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2014/147.aspx\" title=\"\">unveiling plans for future research</a> that \u201cchallenges the policy orthodoxy as often as supports it\u201d. Haldane sees this as a crucial way to ward off the kind of \u201cgroupthink\u201d that led to blind spots among economists and policymakers in the runup to the financial crisis. Let\u2019s hope it heralds more work on falling prices, and gives inflation warriors everywhere something to think about.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Deep in the Somerset countryside Mulberry is working hard to rekindle the popularity of a fashion brand whose allure has suffered in recent years, ever since it made a reckless leap upmarket. Most of Mulberry\u2019s trademark leather handbags are produced in south-west England, including the Cara Delevingne collection of \u201ctown to country\u201d and \u201ctrain to plane\u201d bags designed in collaboration with the 22-year-old British model and featuring her favourite camouflage print. About 60% of its products are made in Somerset factories: there\u2019s the Rookery, in the village of Chilcompton in a fold of the Mendip hills, and the Willows, which opened last year about an hour down the road in Bridgwater. But the business is still recovering from the departure of chief executive Bruno Guillon, whose two-year reign ended in March. It was Guillon\u2019s ill-judged attempt to reposition the brand at the top end of the luxury bag market, as a rival to the likes of Gucci and Prada, that badly damaged its standing. Once-loyal customers felt alienated, unable or unwilling to spend \u00a31,000 or more on the bags produced under Guillon; Mulberry\u2019s traditional ranges cost half that price. Former chief executive Godfrey Davis is now back at the helm as executive director with a mission to win back those core customers. He moved swiftly to reinforce Mulberry\u2019s commitment to its more affordable ranges, but the scale of the challenge is clear: last month Mulberry issued its fourth profit warning this year and is still without a creative director. The highly regarded Emma Hill resigned unexpectedly in June last year amid speculation that she had clashed with Guillon over the direction of the brand. Central to Mulberry\u2019s hoped-for comeback are not just its British customers, but also its British operations. On the factory floor at the Rookery, group production manager Nick Speed says the ups and downs of the business, as well as seasonal changes tend not to affect its UK production lines, because the British manufacturing operation is given priority over factories overseas. Over the past three years, the Rookery has been extended to increase capacity, and the Willows was opened as Mulberry brought its remaining UK production back in-house. \u201cThe UK is very important as a manufacturing base,\u201d says Speed. \u201cWe\u2019re a UK company so we do focus on the UK factories first. When necessary we draw work back from Asia into Europe, and from Europe into the UK. This is always a priority. We\u2019ve only got two Mulberry-owned factories \u2013 the Rookery and the Willows \u2013 and we always make sure that they are filled first. So our workloads tend to be pretty constant.\u201d Workers at the Rookery are busy making bags for the spring/summer 2015 collection, while up in development, designs for next autumn/winter are being worked on. In the leather store, shelves are piled high with sheets of the material. Between 130,000 and 150,000 square feet of leather is cut at the Rookery every month. Cowhide and goatskin are used to make Mulberry goods, as well as ostrich leather and alligator skins. A more surprising sight on the shelves is the stack of boxes of baby wipes: they\u2019re apparently handy for removing minor marks and cleaning workers\u2019 hands. Mulberry has partnerships with manufacturers in Turkey, Spain, Portugal and China, but Speed is keen to highlight the company\u2019s credentials as a British manufacturer. \u201cWe feel its the right thing [to manufacture in the UK],\u201d he says. \u201cAs a business, for our brand and what we\u2019re trying to create, we\u2019re doing this because it is the right thing. Manufacturing in the UK works. \u201cThere are so many logistical problems with manufacturing abroad and the infrastructure you need in place to manage that. There is a cost difference, but our customers are willing to pay for that \u2018made in England\u2019 assurance. We could move it all to Turkey and China and get it made cheaper, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about.\u201d About 95% of the leather used to make Mulberry bags and accessories comes from tanneries in Italy, and is finished and ready to cut by the time it arrives in the UK factories. Mulberry\u2019s production lines in Somerset are busy but the broader decline in Britain\u2019s postwar manufacturing sector is keenly felt here, both in the factories and in the region itself. The area was a traditional heartland of leather production, partly a legacy of shoemaker Clarks, which still has its head office and design and innovation functions in Somerset, but no longer manufactures in the UK. \u201cThere was a lot of leather industry around this area, but they\u2019ve all gone offshore now,\u201d says Speed. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the reverse. Unfortunately that has meant that whereas we used to have tanneries more local to us, they\u2019ve all gone offshore as well. It\u2019s the knock-on effect of manufacturing going away from Britain. \u201cAll those support functions are going away as well. When I first joined the company, we used to get most of our components from the UK \u2013 buckles for our bags, for example, came from the Midlands. Now, unfortunately, we have to go to China to buy these things. We\u2019re always looking for suppliers nearer to home but that element of the manufacturing process hasn\u2019t come back yet. I think it will eventually, but at this moment we have to go where we can get the supplies from.\u201d Production staff at the Rookery are working across 11 production lines. On one line, 15 employees are meticulously working on different aspects of producing Bayswater Buckle handbags. Their target for the day is to make 33 of the items from start to finish. At full capacity, the factory produces up to 1,100 bags a week, with some designs taking longer to make than others. At the end of the line bags are checked for imperfections and returned to the line for further work if necessary. They are all checked again before being neatly packaged up to be sent on their way to the distribution centre in Shepton Mallet, also in Somerset, from where they will be shipped around the world. But before they make it out of the factory door, a 10% sample will be checked one last time. \u201cEverything we manufacture is made to order: it has a pre-determined customer. We don\u2019t make anything for stock,\u201d Speed says. While some specialist manufacturing skills have been lost to the region, Mulberry has the scale to invest in training, partly through its apprenticeship programme. Speed says its skilled workforce is at the heart of Mulberry. \u201cThis is handcraft in action. These are highly skilled people and this will never be taken over by a machine, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Back at head office, Godfrey Davis will be hoping that it is not just supermodel collaborations but skilled staff in Somerset that can reignite the British love affair with Mulberry.",

The Duke of Wellington, the then prime minister, was on hand to watch as inventor and entrepreneur George Stephenson drove the first of a procession of steam-hauled trains along the world\u2019s first inter-city railway line. It was the dawn of the railway age, and the first northern hub. Infrastructure has always mattered. The industrial revolution was not just the story of cotton mills and iron foundries. It was about canals, railways and tarmacadam roads. Big changes to the way people and goods could move around the country boosted growth and transformed the economy. The north led the way: this was the one period in Britain\u2019s history when its economic centre of gravity lay above a line drawn from the Wash to the Severn estuary. Today the entire country is suffering from decades of under-investment in infrastructure. A study produced by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s ratings services last week showed that total investment in new infrastructure has been on a downward trend since the mid-1980s, dropping from 1% of GDP in 1980 to 0.6% in 2008. There was an increase to 0.95% of GDP in 2011 as the government undertook projects to counteract the recession and built the infrastructure needed for the 2012 London Olympics, but this was a temporary boost. This has meant improvements to the country\u2019s transport network have been mothballed and work on new infrastructure projects has been delayed. Investment has been concentrated on the programmes that look set to offer the greatest benefits to the national economy. And in the scramble for resources, the north has lost out to London and the south-east. George Osborne has announced ambitious plans to use infrastructure spending to restore the north to its former glory. Investment in transport links will, the chancellor says, generate a real economic return and help rescue people from the trap of poverty. For this to happen, though, a number of conditions have to be met. First, public money has to be made available to tackle the UK\u2019s infrastructure deficit, estimated by S&amp;P to be in excess of \u00a360bn. Although this will not be easy to find at a time when the public finances are \u00a3100bn in the red, ministers need to make the case for long-term capital spending that will generate benefits for generations to come. Studies show that every pound spent on infrastructure generates much more than a pound of additional economic activity. Second, there needs to be cross-party agreement that infrastructure projects will not be the first to be axed when times get tough. This has been the tendency of governments of both left and right in recent decades, but any short-term benefits have been offset by increased costs of congestion. Third, a proper list of strategic priorities should be announced that would prevent all available resources being gobbled up by the south-east. Regeneration in other areas would be a high-ranking priority. Finally, there needs to be a recognition that the investment that matters is not always on prestige projects. As Stephenson proved 184 years ago, it is sometimes the local schemes that make the difference.",
