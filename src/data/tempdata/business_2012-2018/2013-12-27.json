Shabana Mahmood, the shadow Treasury minister, said people would be astonished that such a lax approach was being adopted after the amount of uncollected tax rose last year.

      "body": "<h2><strong>How is Twitter worth $40bn? </strong><br></h2> <p>The microblogging site floated in November at $26 (\u00a316) a share, or $17bn. The price seemed silly for a company that has never made a profit and is on course for revenues of only $600m this year. Yet the share price is now close to $70. Twitter is plainly a social phenomenon but has yet to show it can take a meaningful chunk of online advertising without infuriating users. The valuation of 60-times revenues is otherworldly; it may also be evidence that heavy doses of quantitative easing have messed up traditional investment radars.</p> <h2><strong>Why was the Co-op Bank farce allowed to run for so long? </strong><br></h2> <p>The Rev Paul Flowers, dubbed the \"Crystal Methodist\" after allegations of drug use, generated the bulk of the headlines. The mystery, however, is why regulators allowed a severely under-capitalised and under-managed Co-op Bank to try to buy 630 branches from Lloyds. The expedition was finally abandoned in April and a \u00a31.5bn capital hole revealed soon afterwards. We are still awaiting a full explanation of why regulators didn't intervene earlier.</p> <h2><strong>How did Help to Buy, mark two, ever get off the ground?</strong> <br></h2> <p>Arguably, the first version of the chancellor's housing scheme, confined to creditworthy first-time buyers, was semi-respectable. The second version, however, involves the state writing first-loss insurance on house purchases worth up to \u00a3600,000. Why? House prices are rising again \u2013 at an annual rate of 10% in London \u2013 and affordability is already stretched if historical price-to-earnings ratios are a guide. Meanwhile, the emergency Funding for Lending scheme for banks is being axed for mortgages. George Osborne is making it harder for the Bank of England to prevent a housing bubble.</p> <h2><strong>Why isn't the growth of zero-hours contracts an election issue? </strong><br></h2> <p>Flexibility in the labour force is an asset and some workers are clearly content with contracts that offer no guarantee of regular work. But, when 1 million people may be employed this way, a large swath of the UK workforce has been quietly casualised. In some cases, workers may be exploited by being denied holiday and sickness pay. The effect on productivity could be long-lasting. The lack of intensity in the political debate is mystifying.</p> <h2><strong>How do investment banks continue to charge so much?</strong> <br></h2> <p>The question could be asked most years, but 2013 brought two startling examples. Barclays shelled out a colossal \u00a3130m in fees to other banks who took little real risk in underwriting a deeply discounted \u00a36bn rights issue. And Severn Trent managed to clock up \u00a319m in \"advisory, legal and other services\" in a single month in resisting a takeover approach that never became a formal bid. For comparison, it cost \u00a34.8m to run the water company's board, comprising five executives and six non-executive directors, for a full year.</p> <h2><strong>Is the eurozone crisis really over? </strong><br></h2> <p>The Cyprus banks crisis was handled crassly at the start of the year. Since then, the wider eurozone crisis has seemed becalmed, despite the continued economic funk in euroland. Greece is still the country to watch. Deflation could quickly undermine the ambition of reducing public debt (now 170% of GDP) if nominal GDP grows only slowly. In that case, a third bailout, and write-offs of loans, may be required. That messy debate could again be alive this time next year.</p> <h2><strong>Does GlaxoSmithKline have a future in China? </strong><br></h2> <p>Back in July, when allegations of bribery and corruption were made against GSK's Chinese unit, a fine and a rapid restructuring of working practices seemed a likely outcome. Five months on, investigations continue, dozens of local employees remain in detention and chief executive Sir Andrew Witty has not been able to draw a line. He says there is \"no question\" about GSK's commitment to China. But the question of how the commitment is meant to be achieved is unresolved.</p> <h2><strong>Can Ed Miliband's proposed freeze on energy bills be made credible? </strong><br></h2> <p>The idea to cap fuel bills for 20 months is popular; it even prompted the government to make a minor tweak of green levies. But does a price freeze, regardless of what happens to the wholesale price of energy, stand any chance of working in practice? How would Labour oblige energy firms to invest in new infrastructure? Would firms really be allowed to set their own tariffs in the 21st month? The answer is supposed to be \"yes\" because the energy market would have been \"re-set\" in a fair and transparent way. That is ambitious, to put it mildly. The plan needs much more detail.</p> <h2><strong>Is it safe to taper? </strong><br></h2> <p>This is the big one for global markets. The US Federal Reserve has started to ease back on quantitative easing, even if the change of gears is hardly crunching \u2013 there will be a $10bn monthly reduction to $75bn. But the expectation of a full and gradual wind-down of asset purchases has been created. If the US recovery proves too weak to allow a full taper, the Fed is in trouble.</p> <h2><strong>How does Jamie Dimon survive at JP Morgan? </strong><br></h2> <p>The US bank paid a record $13bn to settle with the US justice department for mis-selling mortgage securities.

It followed a 1.5% uplift on Boxing Day compared with 2012.</p> <p>However, online retailers confirmed that sales remained strong, in further evidence of changing shopping habits \u2013 with greater numbers cherry-picking the best bargains online from the sofa.</p> <p>High streets were particularly hard hit on Friday, recording a 13.9% slump in visitor numbers, while shopping centres were 1.9% down. Only out-of-town retail parks recorded a rise in visitors, up 2.3%.</p> <p>\"The surge on Boxing Day has had an impact on the following day,\" said Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard. She said the number of shoppers visiting stores across the UK was down 3% in the first three weeks in December. \"Hopes of a last-minute buying spree were blown apart by the bad weather.\"</p> <p>Even John Lewis, which doesn't open on Boxing Day, so that shoppers must wait until the 27th to bag bargains, suggested there had only been a slight uplift in sales on Friday compared with 2012. But the retailer continues to trade online and said there had been a surge in demand.</p> <p>Paula Nickolds, buying and brand director for John Lewis, said: \"More than ever, people are shopping in different ways with us, reflected in the massive 76% share of traffic to johnlewis.com that came from mobile devices on Christmas Day.\"</p> <p>The Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham, meanwhile, welcomed about 150,000 visitors compared with 200,000 on Boxing Day, although the centre was still busy with queues outside some stores, including US teen brand Hollister.</p> <p>It was a different story for online retailers, where sales appeared to build momentum. \"The weather is helping online players. People are staying at home with their turkey leftovers, shopping from home,\" said Jonathan Brown, chief executive of clothing website M&amp;M Direct.</p> <p>Several retailers confirmed that momentum was building online.

      "bodyText": "Retailers hoping for a steady boost from bargain hunters were disappointed on Friday when a strong start to the post-Christmas sales went into reverse. The number of shoppers out and about fell 4.7% across the UK compared with the same day last year, according to retail data company Springboard, as storm warnings and wet weather, particularly in Scotland, deterred shoppers. It followed a 1.5% uplift on Boxing Day compared with 2012. However, online retailers confirmed that sales remained strong, in further evidence of changing shopping habits \u2013 with greater numbers cherry-picking the best bargains online from the sofa. High streets were particularly hard hit on Friday, recording a 13.9% slump in visitor numbers, while shopping centres were 1.9% down. Only out-of-town retail parks recorded a rise in visitors, up 2.3%. \"The surge on Boxing Day has had an impact on the following day,\" said Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard. She said the number of shoppers visiting stores across the UK was down 3% in the first three weeks in December. \"Hopes of a last-minute buying spree were blown apart by the bad weather.\" Even John Lewis, which doesn't open on Boxing Day, so that shoppers must wait until the 27th to bag bargains, suggested there had only been a slight uplift in sales on Friday compared with 2012. But the retailer continues to trade online and said there had been a surge in demand. Paula Nickolds, buying and brand director for John Lewis, said: \"More than ever, people are shopping in different ways with us, reflected in the massive 76% share of traffic to johnlewis.com that came from mobile devices on Christmas Day.\" The Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham, meanwhile, welcomed about 150,000 visitors compared with 200,000 on Boxing Day, although the centre was still busy with queues outside some stores, including US teen brand Hollister. It was a different story for online retailers, where sales appeared to build momentum. \"The weather is helping online players. People are staying at home with their turkey leftovers, shopping from home,\" said Jonathan Brown, chief executive of clothing website M&amp;M Direct. Several retailers confirmed that momentum was building online. B&amp;Q said online sales rose 69% on Boxing Day and 86% on Friday while M&amp;M Direct also reported a double-digit spike in sales on Boxing Day compared with last year and an improvement on Friday. Total online sales on Boxing Day rose 40.4% from last year, according to IBM Digital Analytics, which tracks millions of online transactions. Sales on mobile devices outstripped sales via PCs for the first time. Dixons, the owner of Currys and PC World, said it had recorded a 16% year-on year increase in website traffic from the start of its sale on Christmas Eve until midnight on Christmas Day. Jeremy Fennell, e-commerce director at Dixons, said: \"British shoppers are savvier than ever, using Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to get the jump on Boxing Day sales.\" Clothing retailers said that shoppers were using the internet to ensure they bagged the items they wanted after having tried them on in stores. That's bad news for fashion stores, which have had a difficult end to the year as the mild weather, a squeeze on shoppers' disposable income and competition from tempting and pricey gifts such as games consoles and tablet computers have hit sales. One industry insider suggested that the British clothing market was down as much as 3% year on year in December, although some retailers have managed to preserve or even lift profits by keeping stocks tight and holding back on discounts.

      "bodyText": "Despite the trading week being curtailed for some holiday or other, leading shares continued on their merry way to their best annual performance since 2009, with analysts predicting a new record for the FTSE 100 next year. The index finished at 6750.87 yesterday, up 56.70 points on the day and 144 points on the week albeit amid thin dealing volumes. This was its sixth day of rises, its longest winning streak since the middle of October and its best level since 4 November. Investors are becoming increasingly convinced that the US economy will continue to move ahead in the coming months, despite the US Federal Reserve's recent decision to start turning off the money taps which have been such a key support for the markets. This week's US data helped the positive mood, with strong durable goods orders and a bigger than expected fall in weekly jobless figures. Recent fears of a credit crunch in China were eased by the People's Bank of China injecting liquidity into the market. The leading index is currently up more than 14% on the year, compared to a 22% rise in 2009. In the intervening years, it rose 5.84% in 2012, lost 5.55% in 2011 and rose 9% in 2010. But unlike the leading US markets, the Nikkei and Germany's Dax, the FTSE 100 is still well below its all time closing high (the 6930 level reached in December 1999) so analysts believe the index is likely to advance further next year. Goldman Sachs expects the FTSE 100 to reach 7500 by the end of 2014 while analysts at Killik &amp; Co have a target of 7400. Killik said: We expect equities to enjoy another good year, driven by above-average growth in the US and stabilisation in the eurozone and China. Although there are still risks, ongoing loose monetary policy continues to highlight the relative yield attraction of equities, while M&amp;A could be more of a supportive feature. BSkyB was one company reportedly in the sights of a possible predator. Vodafone was said be considering a bid as a tactic to fend off any approach for the mobile phone group from US rival AT&amp;T. BSkyB shares moved sharply higher on the tale, adding another 11.5p to 844.5p on Friday. Vodafone rose 1.55p to 237.95p. With China saying its industrial output was likely to have grown by 9.8% in 2013, and fears of a credit crunch in the country easing, commodity companies were among the leading gainers on Friday. David Madden, market analyst at IG, said: Overnight the People's Bank of China made a cash injection into the interbank market in order to increase liquidity, driving the borrowing costs for Chinese banks to its biggest weekly drop since 2011. China is a major importer of minerals, and traders bought natural resource stocks as they felt a more robust interbank market would ensure domestic companies would be able to continue their high levels of business activity. So Glencore Xstrata climbed 7.65p to 315.7p while Antofagasta added 25.5p to 830.5p and Mexican silver miner Fresnillo rose 25.5p to 735p. Elsewhere Arm closed 11p higher at \u00a311.06, boosted by the week's news that one of its key customers, Apple, had signed a long awaited deal with China Mobile, giving it access to one of the world's fastest growing markets. Royal Mail added 1.5p to 580p on Friday but its first week as a member of the FTSE 100 saw it lose 11p as profit takers moved in. AstraZeneca dipped 7p to \u00a336.05 as the pharmaceutical group settled a dispute with Japan's Shionogi over its cholosterol treatment Crestor and extended its licensing deal with the company from 2016 to 2013 but with a lower royalty rate in 2014. Lower down the market, Premier Foods had a roller coaster week, slumping 7% after it confirmed it was considering the possibility of a \u00a3300m rights issue, as part of a review of its capital structure. But on Friday it recovered 6.25p or 5% to 131p. Finally International Personal Finance saw its shares lose nearly 16% on Friday. The emerging markets lender announced on Christmas Eve that it had been fined \u00a32.4m from the Polish consumer protection office over the way it calculated APR amounts. Analysts said the move could prove devastating for its business model, with Poland providing 45% of its profits. The company said it would appeal the decision, since it believed on legal advice it was correctly calculating the cost of credit. But it said it was not possible to estimate the impact a final negative ruling might have on its Polish business.",

An earlier deal unravelled when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/24/cyprus-bank-levy-leave-euro\">depositors with savings under \u20ac100,000 were hit with a levy</a>, prompting a fierce backlash.
