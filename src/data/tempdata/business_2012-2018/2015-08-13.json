      "bodyText": "Asda has caved in to pressure from dairy farmers and raised the price it pays its milk supplier, as figures show that sales of fresh milk in Britain are on course to hit their lowest level by value in eight years. Britain\u2019s third-largest grocer said it is increasing the supplier price to \u201ca level that will assist\u201d farmers. Asda will commit to paying 28p per litre for 100% of its liquid milk volume throughout its entire range, ahead of the average price being paid to farmers of 23.66p per litre. A spokesman for the supermarket said: \u201cWe have confirmed to our milk supplier, Arla, that we are increasing the price we pay per litre from Monday to a level that will assist our farmers during the current crisis. Asda\u2019s origins are in dairy farming which is why we are acting in the best interests of our farmers and our customers by increasing the price we pay, introducing the Farmer\u2019s Marque label and not passing on any of the costs to customers \u2013 our retail price stays the same.\u201d The Asda move came as figures compiled for the Guardian by Kantar Worldpanel show that despite a steady climb over eight years in the amount of milk sold, the value of retail sales is likely to be the lowest since 2007. The data supports farmers\u2019 claims that supermarkets are using milk as a weapon in a price war with discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. The fall in the value of sales has been driven by a 17% fall in the average price of a litre of milk since it peaked in 2009. Dairy farmers are due to hold further talks with Morrisons on Friday in an attempt to resolve the crisis, which has prompted direct protests against supermarkets by farmers. The National Farmers Union has warned that dairy producers are facing a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d after the price they are paid for milk has fallen by a quarter over the past year, taking it below the cost of production. Since 2007, the amount of milk sold in the UK has risen by 11% to a projected 5.5bn litres this year. This is thanks to population growth and households buying more milk. However, the value of sales has fallen from a peak of \u00a33.5bn in 2009 to an estimated \u00a33.2bn this year, a drop of 9% and the lowest since 2007. Projected sales for 2015 are based on the performance in the 12 months to July. Rob Harrison, chairman of the NFU dairy board and a dairy farmer himself, said: \u201cWe work incredibly hard to produce milk and it is ultimately used by retailers to get people in their stores. \u201cPeople were optimistic about the dairy industry 18 months ago, there was the potential for growth and global demand, and there still is in the long term. But in the short term there is going to be a lot of pain, so some [farmers] won\u2019t see the medium term.\u201d The impact of the dip in domestic sales has been exacerbated by a cooling in overseas demand for British milk. According to the European commission\u2019s Milk Marketing Observatory, Chinese imports of whole milk powder from Europe were down 56% in the first half of 2015, while skimmed milk powder imports fell 28% and cheese imports dropped 58%. This is down to China attempting to build up its own dairy industry and a slowdown in the economy. Campaigners want supermarkets to increase the amount they pay dairy farmers for milk and change the way they sell the drink in stores. The head of the campaign group Farmers For Action, which has organised protests against Asda and Morrisons, has called the row a \u201cmorality issue\u201d. David Handley, chairman of Farmers For Action, said: \u201cWhy is it necessary to use milk as a loss leader to get people into a shop? Why should farmers bear the brunt of that? There is a morality issue here, and corporate responsibility.\u201d Retailers claim the drop in the price of milks reflects an international decline in commodity prices and an oversupply of milk partly caused by falling demand from Russia and China. The \u201cBig Four\u201d supermarket chains \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 have cut prices in an attempt to boost the volume of products they sell. However, milk volumes were growing before the average price per litre started falling. Morrisons has responded to the debate by launching a new milk brand called Morrisons Milk For Farmers which will be 10p more expensive per litre, with the premium returned directly to dairy farmers. This means a four-pint bottle of the Morrisons Milk For Farmers will cost \u00a31.12, compared with 89p for Morrisons\u2019 standard own-brand milk. Alex Bandini, strategic insight director for dairy at Kantar, said: \u201cRetailers use lower prices for everyday staples to give the perception of value for money, so it could be difficult for them to pull back quickly from current pricing strategies. \u201cWhile we can expect to see retail prices stay down in the coming year on standard supermarket milk, it\u2019s too soon to say what impact Morrisons\u2019 Milk for Farmers brand will have on the market and whether other retailers will follow the same approach.\u201d The NFU will hold events across the country on Friday to mark the day in the year when Britain would run out of food if it relied solely on domestic farms. Back British Farming Day is designed to draw attention to the importance of the country\u2019s farms. This article was amended on 14 August",

      "bodyText": "The good news for the International Monetary Fund, which has been saying for ages that Greece\u2019s debts are unsustainable, is that European lenders now seem to agree. There are \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the sustainability of the country\u2019s debts, the three European institutions negotiating the latest bailout said on Thursday. They think Greece\u2019s debts will peak at 201% of GDP in 2016, which is roughly what the IMF said a month ago when it projected a high \u201cclose to 200% of GDP in the next two years\u201d. So what should be done? Unfortunately, that is where unanimity seems to break down. The IMF\u2019s view of the options in July was blunt. First, there could be \u201cdeep upfront haircuts\u201d \u2013 in other words, a portion of Greece\u2019s debts to eurozone lenders would be written off, which, reading between the lines, seemed to be the IMF\u2019s first preference. Second, there was the politically-impossible policy of eurozone partners making explicit transfers to Greece every year. Or, third, Greece could be given longer to repay, an approach likely to be more palatable to European leaders. But this option came with a heavy qualification from the IMF: \u201cIf Europe prefers to again provide debt relief through maturity extension, there would have to be a very dramatic extension with grace periods of, say, 30 years on the entire stock of European debt, including new assistance.\u201d Is Europe ready to be \u201cvery dramatic,\u201d as the IMF defined it? Almost certainly not \u2013 at least not in Germany. Thursday\u2019s European report spoke about extending repayment schedules but it seems highly unlikely that 30 years would be acceptable in Berlin. If that\u2019s correct, the IMF\u2019s willingness to cough up its \u20ac15bn-\u20ac20bn contribution to the latest \u20ac85bn (\u00a360bn) rescue package must be in serious doubt. The fund\u2019s guidelines say loans can only be advanced when there is a clear path back to debt sustainability, usually defined as borrowings being less than 120% of GDP. On Thursday\u2019s European analysis, Greece would still be at 160% even in 2022. In the first Greek bailout of 2010, the IMF bent its own rules to take part, declaring Greece to be a special case. That led to accusations it was trying to save the euro rather than help Greece, a charge reinforced when the IMF, in an excruciating piece of self-analysis, later confessed its economic projections had been \u201coverly optimistic\u201d. The IMF, surely, won\u2019t want to get into another mess of that sort. There will, however, be heavy pressure from Germany to compromise and dilute the debt relief. It will be hard to get any bailout package through the German parliament but the task might be impossible if the IMF won\u2019t endorse it. Nevertheless, the IMF should stick to its guns. Greece needs serious debt relief, not token measures. It is about time that lenders accepted the economic reality that piecemeal measures are pointless when debt ratios reach 200%. The IMF should do the principled thing: insist either on haircuts or a 30-year grace period on repayments. Anything else would damage its credibility further. Cashing in too early As investors anxiously await Glencore\u2019s half-year figures, as described on Wednesday, the production update contained a taster. This year\u2019s capital expenditure budget is being cut again. It has now fallen in stages from $7.9bn to $6bn. That\u2019s not a surprise given that commodity prices remain weak but it\u2019s worth remembering that the company launched a $1bn share buyback only a year ago. Chief executive Ivan Glasenberg was feeling flush with cash last August. Glencore wanted to \u201cwalk the walk,\u201d be nice to shareholders and avoid having a \u201clazy\u201d balance sheet. Most of the $1bn was spent before December when Glencore\u2019s shares traded between 280p and 330p. Now they\u2019re 177p as the market frets about the company\u2019s ability to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating. There have been many ill-judged buybacks over the years, especially in a mining sector where optimism is the default setting in boardrooms. Glencore\u2019s joins the list. Regulators cooperative The Co-op Bank is too weak to pay a fine for past failings, its regulators decided this week. How weak is it? Here is the assessment by credit rating agency Moody\u2019s of the damage that would have been done if the Co-op had been forced to cough up. \u201cA \u00a3120m fine, even reduced to \u00a385m under an early settlement agreement, would have resulted in a significant erosion of the capital position of the bank and potentially threatened its future sustainability,\u201d said Moody\u2019s. Strong stuff. And, remember, \u00a3120m was merely the penalty that would have been imposed by the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority. The Financial Conduct Authority also waived its fine \u2013 it\u2019s just that, oddly, it didn\u2019t mention a figure.

      "bodyText": "As the Greek parliament prepares to vote on the terms of the third bailout, the country\u2019s creditors have expressed serious concerns about the sustainability of its debt. But they believe a haircut is not necessary and believe that extending debt maturities and easing terms will bring borrowings back to a sustainable level. The report came shortly after Greece surprisingly revealed that its economy grew at a quarterly rate of 0.8% in the second quarter, following zero growth in the first three months of the year. Analysts had expected a 0.5% contraction, and there was much scepticism about the figures, which after all are only an initial estimate. Meanwhile, as the Greek parliament discussed the bailout, current finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos urged MPs to quickly approve the deal, while his predecessor Yanis Varoufakis claimed the agreement was not viable. There are also growing splits within the governing Syriza party, with former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis leading a group calling for an anti-bailout movement. The Eurogroup of finance ministers is due to examine the bailout deal tomorrow, following the vote in the Greek parliament which is expected later tonight after parliamentary committee passed the agreement. Earlier, markets welcomed a calmer period for China\u2019s currency after days of turmoil following its devaluation, as Beijing said there was no need for any further depreciation in the yuan. But much of the gains evaporated after strong US retail sales figures prompted renewed talk of a Federal Reserve rate rise next month. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for the result of the Greek vote, the Eurogroup meeting and eurozone GDP. Much of the early gains made by stock markets evaporated by the close. Initially, the fact that some stability had returned to China\u2019s currency after several days of turmoil after its surprise devaluation helped push global shares sharply higher. But strong US retail sales revived talk of a rate rise in September by the Federal Reserve and took off some of the gloss. A strong dollar helped knock back oil prices and also undermined share prices. So the closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 dipped 2.86 points or 0.04%, but part of the fall was due to a number of major companies seeing their shares go ex-dividend Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.82% to 11,014.63 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.25% at 4986.85 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.56% to 23,356.01 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.62% at 10,947.9 The Athens market slipped 0.69% to 686.65 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 23 points or 0.13%. Oil is on the slide again Partly due to a rise in the dollar in the expectation of a US rate rise next month, Brent crude has fallen 1.25% to $49.04 a barrel. On top of that, there were reports of stockpiling, fuelling fears once more of oversupply and weak demand. According to Reuters, market intelligence company Genscape reported an increase of more than 1.3m barrels at a key delivery point in Oklahoma. Greek parliamentary speaker Zoi Konstantopoulou had delayed today\u2019s proceedings by moving committee debates on the bailout from Wednesday to Thursday morning. Now things are underway she had taken the opportunity for a pop at Germany. According to Greek newspaper Kathimerini she has said parliament does not exist solely to rubber-stamp orders from German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has been speaking in parliament about the bailout and - predictably - he is not too happy. And the diplomatic moves continue. Greek president Prokopis Pavlopoulos had a telephone conversation with European President Jean-Claude Juncker earlier today about the Eurogroup meeting. On Wednesday Pavlopoulos talked to both French president Francois Hollande and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi. Greece\u2019s main opposition party New Democracy looks like it will support the bailout in tonight\u2019s parliamentary vote, although not without some misgivings. Back with Greece: Wall Street has taken some of the shine off European markets, which had earlier been boosted by signs of stability in China after the dramatic moves in the yuan this week. With strong US economic data, including retail sales, analysts have begun talking about a rate rise from the Federal Reserve next month, something which the Chinese turmoil had started to put in doubt. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 32 points, knocking the FTSE 100 back from its earlier highs to a gain of just one point. But Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.11% ahead of the Greek vote on the latest bailout plan and Friday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1.43%. Among the documents sent from the European Commission to the Eurogroup, there is one on a bridging loan as a contingency plan. EC spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt said: Submitting the documents (on a bridging loan) was only as a contingency. It is now in the hands of the eurozone finance ministers to take a final decision. It is not a decision for the Commission to take. (Quotes from AFP) More on the backing for the Greek bailout from Finland - which last month had suggested it preferred that Greece temporarily leave the eurozone. The Finnish parliament\u2019s grand committee voted by 18 to 4 to allow finance minister Alexander Stubb to approve the deal at Friday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. Stubb said (quotes from Reuters): We have come a long way during the summer. The future of the euro was at stake...but now we\u2019ve got a solution and will live with it. But he added that it was important for the International Monetary Fund to stay involved in the bailout process. Another step towards a Greek agreement: a statement from the European Commission. Following the technical agreement on a Memorandum of Understanding between the Institutions and the Greek authorities, the Commission this morning adopted the necessary draft Council decisions for a three-year programme under the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). These documents were transmitted to the Council ahead of the Eurogroup meeting on Friday. President Juncker has spoken to President of the Eurogroup Dijsselbloem to inform him of this and to prepare tomorrow\u2019s Eurogroup, where the Commission will be represented by Vice-President Dombrovskis, responsible for the Euro and Social Dialogue. Analysts agree the US retail sales figures could presage a rate rise next month despite this week\u2019s Chinese moves. Rob Carnell at ING Bank said: US retail sales for July were good enough not to damage September Fed rate hike prospects further, following the jitters in the aftermath of China\u2019s recent devaluations. The headline rate rose 0.6% month on month, but there were strong upward revisions to the previous month\u2019s data, and taken together, the outcome should be seen as stronger than the prevailing consensus view. Auto sales were strong, as expected, but the core figures weren\u2019t bad either, with the 3 month annualised \u201ccontrol\u201d sales group rising at a chunky 5.2% annualised rate. The only disappointments in the sales figures came from electronics and general merchandise, of which department store sales are a key element. Food and beverages sales were flat, but there were gains in all other subcomponents, so the gains were widely spread \u2013 which always looks more convincing than a few huge increases. With external developments taking a more prominent role in considerations of Fed policy as far as markets are concerned, this release does not seal a September rate hike, which markets continue to view as a marginal call. But it does shift the balance back to September, and we continue to think September will mark lift-off for the Fed. Dennis de Jong, managing director of broker UFSX.com, said: Every piece of data coming out of the US in the next couple of weeks has extra significance as it could be the difference between an interest rate hike in September or December. Janet Yellen and her Fed colleagues will be poring over everything ahead of their meeting in September and she will be encouraged that retail sales have bounced back slightly from a disappointing performance in June. Consumer confidence isn\u2019t quite where the Fed would want it to be, although the labour market is looking fairly resilient and today\u2019s figures are unlikely to make Yellen delay any longer. In the US, retail sales rose in July by slightly more than expected, adding some fuel to those expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in September. The turmoil caused by China\u2019s devaluation of the yuan could yet affect the mood of the Fed. But these latest figures show a rebound to a rise of 0.6% from a flat performance in June (itself revised up from an initial 0.3% fall). Economists had expected an increase of 0.5%. The figures were boosted by a revival in car sales, up 1.4% after falling 1.5% in June, with clothing, furniture and restaurants also recording increases. Meanwhile weekly jobless claims rose unexpectedly by 5,000 to 274,000. But the previous week was revised down to show 1,000 fewer claims, and despite rising for three straight weeks, the claims number has remained below 300,000 - seen as a sign of a firm jobs market - for 23 weeks in a row. Finland is ready to participate in Greece\u2019s latest rescue package, its finance minister Alexander Stubb said. Our economics editor Larry Elliott looked at the debt analysis drawn up by Greece\u2019s European creditors. You can read the full story here. Greece\u2019s European creditors have underlined the temporary nature of the country\u2019s surprise return to growth by warning that they have \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the spiralling debts of the eurozone\u2019s weakest member. The three European institutions negotiating a third bailout package with the government in Athens said that the Greek economy had plunged into a deep recession from which it would not emerge until 2017. According to an analysis completed by the European commission, the European Central Bank and the eurozone bailout fund, Greece\u2019s debts will peak at 201% of its national output (GDP) in 2016. The study says that Greece\u2019s debt burden can be made more bearable by waiving payments until the economy has recovered and then giving Athens longer to pay. However, it opposes the idea of a so-called \u201chaircut\u201d \u2013 reducing the size of the debt, a course of action the International Monetary Fund thinks may be necessary for Greece\u2019s debts to become sustainable.\u201d And if you are wondering what exactly Greece has signed up for in the new memorandum of understanding struck with its creditors in exchange for an \u20ac86bn bailout, take a look at this analysis from our economics correspondent Heather Stewart. German deputy finance minister Jens Spahn said earlier on Thursday that both Berlin and Paris want further information on Greece\u2019s plans to privatise parts of its economy before approving a third bailout package. He told Deutschlandfunk: Germany is not the only country that still has questions at the moment. We still need to talk with each other on a few issues. That is why we have a Eurogroup meeting on Friday in Brussels. We need more details in some areas. That is what we need to talk about - by the way we have a joint proposal from France and Germany.\u201d But he paid tribute to Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government, saying it was clear that it had \u201ccome a long way\u201d and been \u201cvery constructive\u201d during the negotiations, with a \u201chigh degree of willingness to reform\u201d. \u201cThere is a clear recognition that Greece needs to change if it wants to stay in the eurozone,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to acknowledge that. A lot has been achieved.\u201d Greece will receive the first tranche of the new bailout, of \u20ac23bn, later this month, Reuters reported, citing an anonymous source, assuming the package is approved by the Greek and other national parliaments and a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Friday. The source said the package consists of \u20ac85.5bn of aid and an estimated \u20ac6.2bn of privatisation revenues through 2018. And here is the Wall Street Journal\u2019s take: A new assessment says there are serious concerns about the sustainability of Greek government debt and that it will require mitigating measures\u2014a step many eurozone governments have been reluctant to take. The three-page document, which has been seen by The Wall Street Journal, was prepared by the European institutions that have been negotiating a new bailout program, including the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the eurozone bailout fund. The document doesn\u2019t mention the views of the International Monetary Fund, suggesting that there are once again differences between the Washington-based fund and its European partners. The four institutions earlier this week agreed on a new bailout program with the Greek government, which includes sharp spending cuts and strict policy overhauls. Even if Greece implements the full bailout program and manages to raise \u20ac13.9bn ($15.45 billion) from privatizing state assets, its debt is expected to remain at 159.7% of gross domestic product in 2022, the document says. The 2022 level is important because eurozone finance ministers had previously promised to bring Greece\u2019s debt to below 110% of GDP by then, in an effort to keep the IMF involved in saving the country from default and an exit from the euro. If Greece only partially implements the program, its debt would be at 173.7% of GDP in 2022, the document says. If Greece achieves better than expected growth and privatization receipts its debt could fall to 148.2% of GDP in 2022. The document doesn\u2019t say what would happen to Greece\u2019s debt if the government fails to implement the program\u2014a scenario the IMF had found the most likely in a previous version of the debt sustainability analysis prepared before capital controls were introduced in late June. Because of the deterioration the Greek economy, which the institutions expect to shrink 2.3% this year and 1.3% next year, there are now \u201cserious concerns\u201d about whether the country will be able to pay back its debts, the document says. To help ensure debt sustainability, the document suggest that eurozone governments should once again agree to transfer to Athens central banks\u2019 profits from their holdings of Greek government bonds. In addition, they would have to give Greece more time to pay bailout loans and interest on those loans, the document says. This way, governments might be able to avoid a reduction to the nominal value of the debt, known as a haircut, the document adds.\u201d It appears that the International Monetary Fund, which has been pushing for a debt write-off for Greece, was not involved in this analysis. Despite citing \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Greece\u2019s debt, the country\u2019s European creditor institutions do not see the need for a haircut, but argue that extending debt maturities and easing terms will bring the country back to a sustainable level of debt. This is what Germany has proposed \u2013 see the comments from deputy finance minister Jens Spahn earlier. Here is the Reuters story in full: The creditor institutions which have agreed a draft third bailout for Greece have \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the sustainability of Greek public debt although they believe a nominal haircut can be avoided, a debt sustainability analysis seen by Reuters on Thursday showed. \u201cThe high debt to GDP and the gross financing needs resulting from this analysis point to serious concerns regarding the sustainability of Greece\u2019s public debt,\u201d said the analysis, adding far-reaching reforms were needed to address the worries. \u201cIn sum, an appropriate combination of extension of maturities and grace periods for principals and interests would allow to bring Greece debt back to a sustainable level in gross financing needs terms without the need for a nominal haircut as stated by the Euro Summit of 12 July,\u201d it added. The analysis saw privatisation proceeds, excluding those from banks, of \u20ac13.9bn through 2022. The institutions expect the Greek economy to shrink by 2.3% this year and by 1.3 percent next year, before returning to 2.7% growth in 2017.\u201d According to the report, Greece will only return to economic growth, of 2.7%, in 2017 following two more years of recession this year and next. According to a series of flashes on Reuters, a new debt sustainability analysis from Greece\u2019s institutional creditors projects debt to GDP rising to 201% in 2016, 175% in 2020, 160% in 2022 and 122% in 2030. The analysis cites \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the sustainability of Greece\u2019s public debt. Marcos Casarin at Oxford Economics has looked at the potential implications of China\u2019s yuan devaluation for the world economy. We simulate an \u201cother things equal\u201d 10% yuan depreciation against the US dollar on our global economic model. It has a small positive effect on Chinese GDP, but is deflationary for other countries. Other things are not exactly equal of course, and we also provide a reminder of the more powerful simulated impact on the global economy of a sharp China slowdown to 4.4% growth over the medium term. The \u201cna\u00efve\u201d simulation of a 10% renminbi depreciation (holding other things constant) would reduce inflation in some countries (the German CPI is 0.3pp lower by 2017). The Fed would most likely delay its first rate hike beyond September and global bond yields would remain lower for longer. There are some negative output implications, particularly for China\u2019s competitors in Asia. The global recovery would be a bit slower than we currently forecast, with growth of 2.9% in 2016 rather than 3%. Other things are not equal of course, and in the context of the broader Chinese slowdown, the impact is much stronger. In such a case, our modelling work suggests Fed tightening would be delayed and slower, with US 10-year yields dropping back below 2% in 2016-17.\u201d Here is our full story on the strong GDP figures for Greece. Demand for gold weakened in the second quarter as China and India, key consumers, cut back, the World Gold Council said in its quarterly update. Total demand fell by 12% from a year earlier to 915 tonnes. The WGC added: However, demand in Europe and the US grew, driven by a mixture of increasingly confident jewellery buyers and strong demand for bars and coins. Looking ahead, there are encouraging signs moving into what are traditionally the busiest quarters for gold buying in India and China.\u201d However, the price of gold plummeted in July, the start of the third quarter, hitting its lowest level in more than five years, at $1,072.35 an ounce. Since then it has recovered to above $1,100 an ounce. Gold prices have been hurt by the strong dollar, which makes commodities priced in dollars more expensive for investors who hold other currencies. The WGC expects gold demand in China to hold up this year, coming in at similar levels as last year, despite the yuan\u2019s devaluation this week. Roland Wang, managing director, told Reuters: We still have the confidence that consumption of gold in China will remain at similar levels as last year.\u201d China consumed 973.6 tonnes of gold last year and the WGC has forecast demand of 900 to 1,000 tonnes this year. Spot gold touched a three-week high of $1,126 an ounce on Thursday. Q2\u2019s Greek GDP figures brought some rare good news. But they relate to an entirely different economy than the one currently being strangled by capital controls, says Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics. The 0.8% rise in Greek GDP in Q2 came as a pleasant surprise after the 3.2% quarterly contraction in industrial production seen in the quarter and the generally downbeat message from business surveys seen over recent months. We had feared a big contraction, though note that the figures may well be revised in later releases. \uf0b7 We have no breakdown at this stage. But monthly retail sales figures suggest that stronger household spending - perhaps in anticipation of capital controls - may have contributed to the expansion. Investment may also have rebounded after a steep (7.5%) quarterly drop in Q1. The figures may provide some hope that the underlying state of the economy is rather healthier than has been generally perceived. But the key point, of course, is that the numbers relate almost entirely to the period before the imposition of capital controls at the end of June. Survey indicators such as the EC\u2019s measure of economic sentiment suggest that activity has since collapsed dramatically. \uf0b7 Activity will presumably rebound when the capital controls are lifted. But it is not clear that will be very soon, despite the recent progress towards a third bailout. And the apparent extent of the damage points to lasting effects on growth and employment. \uf0b7 Accordingly, Q2\u2019s figures do not change our view that the economic assumptions built into the bailout plan are likely to prove far too optimistic. Barring revisions to the Q2 data, this year\u2019s forecast of a 2.3% drop in GDP might now be just about achievable. But the projections for a smaller decline of 1.3% next year and strong growth thereafter look hopeful given Greece\u2019s lack of competitiveness and the additional austerity required by the bailout conditions. \uf0b7 Overall, for once some good news from Greece. But the economy has changed dramatically since. One of our readers, IfigEusLannuon, has commented: On the good Q2 numbers for Greek GDP (+0.8%). They can be explained by the fact that Greek GDP were on a growth trend before the elections announcement, so the Q4 2014 and Q1 2015 that were negative numbers were maybe outliers numbers. In Q2, the February 20th agreement was reached, so you can say April-May-June was a relative stability period that helped the growth. Another phenomenon that can have played is that a lot of people withdrew money from their accounts when they started being afraid of Grexit in Q2, and some of this money surely went into consumption and not under mattresses. I do remember excellent numbers for car sales at the period for example; new cars being good for storing wealth.\u201d The latest GDP figures mean Greece did not slide back into recession at the start of this year as previously thought, in a boost to Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government. Analysts say some sectors of the Greek economy, such as tourism, have proven surprisingly resilient, despite the country\u2019s near-bankruptcy. Nikos Magginas at National Bank told Reuters: Some economic activity indicators in the second quarter, including consumption, industrial production and tourism, had shown particular resilience. This explains the surprising second quarter GDP reading.\u201d He said the data point to a better outlook for the Greek economy this year, making an overall contraction of less than 2% \u201crealistic\u201d. Under the baseline scenario used in Greece\u2019s new bailout agreement, the economy is projected to shrink by 2.1% to 2.3%. Ireland\u2019s annual EU harmonised inflation rate has come in at 0.2% for July, down from 0.4% in June, as prices fell by 0.3% month-on-month. Of course, the Greek GDP figures are a flash estimate and subject to revision. The statistics office notes: Users should note that the present flash estimates are expected to be revised when provisional estimates are produced and disseminated on 28/08/2015 on the basis of updated primary data that will have become available at that point.\u201d The Greek statistics office ELSTAT has not given further details on the intriguing GDP figures, but it has published this table: The GDP figures are for the period before Athens introduced capital controls and shut the Greek stock exchange for five weeks and the banks for three weeks. Even so, they are hard to believe... Greece\u2019s economy grew at a quarterly rate of 0.8% in the second quarter, following zero growth in the first three months of the year, according to statistics service ELSTAT. This came as a complete surprise to economists who had expected a 0.5% contraction. The first quarter was revised higher from a 0.2% decline. The figures put Greece ahead of the UK, which expanded by 0.7% between April and June. Oil prices continue to recover, with Brent crude rising above $50 a barrel this morning. Data showed US stockpiles of crude oil and gasoline fell last week, easing concerns over a global glut of supply. Brent was up 1.1% at $50.22 while New York light crude climbed 0.4% to $43.49 a barrel. China\u2019s devaluation of the yuan is a storm in a teacup, argues Mike Sell, head of Asian investments at Alquity. This week\u2019s fall has generated headlines, but pales into comparison with other emerging market currencies. The Brazilian Real is down 31% against the dollar since the start of the year, Indonesia\u2019s Rupiah is down 11%, and the Malaysian Ringgit down 15%. The Euro itself is down 9% since January. We do not see this as either the start of a \u201ccurrency war\u201d or a concerted policy to boost exports. The Chinese government is perfectly aware it will not be able to devalue its way to competitiveness with the likes of Vietnam and Cambodia, where labour costs are half those in China. Instead, China\u2019s actions are motivated as much by politics as economics. The government resisted devaluating the yuan during the Asian financial crisis in 1998, in large part due to their desire to be seen as Asia\u2019s regional leader. Similar concerns are at play today. At the same time, Beijing is pushing for the yuan\u2019s entrance into the basket of currencies which provide the value for the IMF\u2019s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) \u2013 effectively its reserve assets. Acceptance would establish the yuan as an internationally recognised reserve currency. However, inclusion requires the yuan to be recognised as \u201cfreely usable\u201d. The move towards a more market-oriented means for determining the currency\u2019s exchange rate is a clear step in that direction, and a signal of intent in the direction of the IMF, which has welcomed the move. These events reinforce our conviction investment in China is best achieved through targeting sustainably run, well governed companies with exposure to the country\u2019s long term development trends, such as urbanisation and the country\u2019s growing consumer class. These trends have proven largely resistant to market disruption. At the same time, focusing on equities with high ESG scores has provided protection against both short term volatility and tail risk.\u201d The Greek parliament is gearing up for another all-nighter. But a spokeswoman for the Syriza government, Olga Gerovasili, warned the Syriza rebels that a government without a majority \u201ccannot go far\u201d and raised the possibility of early elections. She told Greece\u2019s Mega TV: It is known that some Syriza lawmakers will not vote in favour of the accord. A government that does not have a governing majority cannot go far.\u201d The new rescue package for Greece contains further draconian measures and will give the country\u2019s eurozone creditors powers over vast areas of Athens\u2019 policymaking, as we reported on Wednesday. As the debate in the Greek parliament gets under way, Greek actress, playwright and director tweeted: Back to Greece... the finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos is speaking. Some calm has returned to commodity markets, with copper rising for a second session. Copper on the London Metal Exchange climbed 0.7% to $5,224.50 this morning. Copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed 1.7% higher at 39.580 yuan a tonne. The dollar has also recovered somewhat, rising from a one-month low against a basket of major currencies as the yuan\u2019s slide slowed. The greenback has lost about 3% since China started devaluing its currency on Tuesday, taking markets off guard. Angus Campbell, senior analyst at online broker FxPro, says: Today the key event is the release of US retail sales data at 13.30 UK time and if this is softer than the expected month on month figure of 0.5% then this could cause the dollar to have another leg downwards.\u201d Inflation figures out for Germany, France and Spain this morning showed all stayed out of deflation territory in July on an annual basis \u2013 but inflation is low or even non-existent and far below the European Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Spain\u2019s EU harmonised annual inflation rate remained at zero, while economists had expected a fall to -0.1%. Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, recorded inflation of 0.1%, a five-month low. France\u2019s annual inflation rate dipped to 0.2% from 0.3% \u2013 a touch weaker than expected \u2013 with prices falling 0.5% month-on-month in July. Germany\u2019s deputy finance minister Jens Spahn has signalled that Germany is ready to talk about debt relief for Greece, by extending the maturity of loans or easing the terms \u2013 although he ruled out a haircut. He told the German radio station Deutschlandfunk: A so-called haircut is not legal, where you give up some debt ... but under the term debt relief you can also talk about extending maturities, having a period without making interest payments or redemption payments and we can talk about that, we have always said that.\u201d Spahn played down any differences within the German government on the new rescue package for Greece, saying the Berlin government is \u201cpulling together\u201d in getting a deal with Greece that fulfilled certain conditions. The whole German government .. acknowledges that the Greek government has shifted a good deal. There is a constructive attitude, a willingness to (undertake) reforms, there is a recognition that Greece must change if it wants to stay in the eurozone.\u201d He said some outstanding questions, such as on privatisations and bank recapitalisation, have to be addressed this week and reiterated that it is important for Germany that the International Monetary Fund stays involved in the process. Travel group Tui is the top riser on the FTSE, with its shares jumping 7.7% after the company said it sees annual profit growth at the top end of its targeted range. The world\u2019s largest leisure tourism group said strong summer bookings offset the impact of the Tunisian beach gun attack. Recruitment firm Michael Page is up 4% after the firm announced a special dividend. European stock markets have opened higher following Wednesday\u2019s rally on Wall Street, and as Beijing pledged there would no further weakening of the yuan. The FTSE 100 index in London is up 0.8% to 6623.53. Germany\u2019s Dax has risen 1.6%; France\u2019s CAC has gained 1.7%; and Spain\u2019s Ibex and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB are both up 1.5% in early trading. Internal German government documents seen by the Guardian revealed several major objections to the draft package, including questions about Greece\u2019s debt sustainability, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s support for the deal, and delays in planned privatisations. J\u00fcrg Wei\u00dfgerber, spokesman for the German finance ministry, said on Wednesday: Bridge financing is not off the table. We\u2019re still taking bridge financing into consideration if it\u2019s not possible to pay out a first tranche in August to meet the outstanding obligations.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Another day, another yuan devaluation: China\u2019s central bank has cut the reference rate for its currency for the third day, by a further 1.1%. Global financial markets have been unsettled since its surprise move to devalue the yuan by a record 1.9% on Tuesday. The move will benefit Chinese exporters and sparked fears of a global currency war. In an attempt to reassure markets, the People\u2019s Bank of China said there is no basis for further depreciation in the yuan, arguing that the country\u2019s strong economic environment, trade surplus, sound fiscal position and deep foreign exchange reserves provide \u201cstrong support\u201d to the exchange rate. The central bank said it would monitor \u201cabnormal\u201d cross border flows. A deputy central bank governor, Zhang Xiaohui, said at a press conference there is \u201cno basis for persistent and substantial devaluation\u201d. In Greece, parliament is holding an emergency session to debate and ratify the new bailout package, worth \u20ac85bn in fresh loans in return for reforms. The 400-page deal is likely to be approved with the support of opposition parties, despite rebellion within prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 own leftist Syriza party. A vote is not expected until the early hours of Friday. The other eurozone member states will then vote on it at a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels on Friday afternoon. But it is unclear whether the rescue package will get backing from Germany. It has to be ratified by a number of other national parliaments, including the Bundestag.

Auto sales were strong, as expected, but the core figures weren\u2019t bad either, with the 3 month annualised \u201ccontrol\u201d sales group rising at a chunky 5.2% annualised rate.</p> <p>The only disappointments in the sales figures came from electronics and general merchandise, of which department store sales are a key element. Food and beverages sales were flat, but there were gains in all other subcomponents, so the gains were widely spread \u2013 which always looks more convincing than a few huge increases.</p> <p>With external developments taking a more prominent role in considerations of Fed policy as far as markets are concerned, this release does not seal a September rate hike, which markets continue to view as a marginal call.

The four institutions earlier this week agreed on a new bailout program with the Greek government, which includes sharp spending cuts and strict policy overhauls.</p> <p>Even if Greece implements the full bailout program and manages to raise \u20ac13.9bn ($15.45 billion) from privatizing state assets, its debt is expected to remain at 159.7% of gross domestic product in 2022, the document says.</p> <p>The 2022 level is important because eurozone finance ministers had previously promised to bring Greece\u2019s debt to below 110% of GDP by then, in an effort to keep the IMF involved in saving the country from default and an exit from the euro.</p> <p>If Greece only partially implements the program, its debt would be at 173.7% of GDP in 2022, the document says.

But they relate to an entirely different economy than the one currently being strangled by capital controls, says Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics.</p> <ul> <li>The 0.8% rise in Greek GDP in Q2 came as a pleasant surprise after the 3.2% quarterly contraction in industrial production seen in the quarter and the generally downbeat message from business surveys seen over recent months. We had feared a big contraction, though note that the figures may well be revised in later releases. </li> <li>\uf0b7 We have no breakdown at this stage. But monthly retail sales figures suggest that stronger household spending - perhaps in anticipation of capital controls - may have contributed to the expansion. Investment may also have rebounded after a steep (7.5%) quarterly drop in Q1.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconEurope/statuses/631755002818768896\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greek?src=hash\">#Greek</a> economy surprisingly expanded by 0.8% q/q, 1.4%y/y in Q2.

But the key point, of course, is that the numbers relate almost entirely to the period before the imposition of capital controls at the end of June. Survey indicators such as the EC\u2019s measure of economic sentiment suggest that activity has since collapsed dramatically. </li> <li>\uf0b7 Activity will presumably rebound when the capital controls are lifted. But it is not clear that will be very soon, despite the recent progress towards a third bailout. And the apparent extent of the damage points to lasting effects on growth and employment.</li> <li>\uf0b7 Accordingly, Q2\u2019s figures do not change our view that the economic assumptions built into the bailout plan are likely to prove far too optimistic. Barring revisions to the Q2 data, this year\u2019s forecast of a 2.3% drop in GDP might now be just about achievable. But the projections for a smaller decline of 1.3% next year and strong growth thereafter look hopeful given Greece\u2019s lack of competitiveness and the additional austerity required by the bailout conditions.</li> <li>\uf0b7 <strong>Overall, for once some good news from Greece.

They can be explained by the fact that Greek GDP were on a growth trend before the elections announcement, so the Q4 2014 and Q1 2015 that were negative numbers were maybe outliers numbers. In Q2, the February 20th agreement was reached, so you can say April-May-June was a relative stability period that helped the growth. Another phenomenon that can have played is that a lot of people withdrew money from their accounts when they started being afraid of Grexit in Q2, and some of this money surely went into consumption and not under mattresses.

      "bodyText": "The recent Greek capitulation under pressure from other euro member countries, led by Germany, demonstrates that euro members have de facto ceded sovereignty over fiscal policy to the EU. While this arrangement may be acceptable to some countries, perhaps even Greece, it will be resisted by others. However, as the Greek failure also demonstrates, any eurozone country wishing to restore fiscal sovereignty, or restructure some of their debt, or implement any policy or set of policies that runs afoul of the preferences of certain Eurogroup finance ministers will have near-zero negotiating leverage if they fail to plan, credibly and in advance, for the introduction of a viable alternative currency. Without this critical card to play, the country in question will be held hostage by the now politicised ECB. Its domestic banking system and financial markets will be shut down, the economy will grind to a halt and the government will face either a humiliating retreat or full capitulation. Former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has now revealed much of the detail of the recent negotiations, capitulation and attempts to vilify him personally for acting insubordinately or even in a treasonous manner at the 11th hour. However, it is entirely understandable that, once Varoufakis became aware of the degree to which his country\u2019s banks and national finances had been taken hostage by the ECB and EU institutions, he sought some flexibility in order to strengthen Greece\u2019s negotiating position. Alas, this was much too little, and way too late. In retrospect, it is now obvious that Varoufakis and his colleagues should have set about developing a credible alternative currency plan prior to entering into any negotiations around either debt reduction or fiscal reforms. Had they done so, when the ECB suspended further increases in the ELA, forcing the banks and financial markets to close, Greece would have been able to roll out a temporary plan which, in the event that subsequent negotiations were indeed to fail, could easily have become permanent. Moreover, the very existence of such a plan would have greatly strengthened Greece\u2019s hand to the point where negotiations may well have succeeded. Although it might sound a daunting prospect, introducing an alternative currency is not particularly difficult as long as the fundamentals of currency design are understood by its architects, and it is professionally planned in advance. The problem for Greece and other countries is that currency design is a skill which the troika are actively seeking to have every nation \u201cunlearn\u201d, in Orwellian speak. The personal careers of too many senior officials depend upon no one of the 19 nations breaking away and thriving, rather than collapsing. Having spent four years pitching currency design alternatives to an array of governments, central banks, and leading opposition parties we are happy to set out the basic steps. The domestic banking and payments systems must be made sufficiently flexible to switch from one unit of account to another. Either physical cash, or some form of electronic cash, such as debit or credit cards, must be printed or produced in advance, with a robust distribution plan. These logistical considerations are no different in principle than a new product rollout for a major corporation in a major industry. What is different, and requires due consideration, is how a new national currency will be credible in the eyes of the public expected to use it. Any currency thought to be at risk of a major devaluation will struggle to gain sufficient credibility. However, if the currency is introduced at an already credibly devalued rate \u2013 one which would reset Greek unit labour costs to a level competitive with the euro area average for example \u2013 and the national debt burden is also redenominated in a fait accompli visa-vis creditors, greatly reducing its value in real if not nominal terms, then the new currency\u2019s value will indeed be credible and will be able to support commerce and business as usual. Additional credibility-boosting actions could include the build-up of foreign reserves, say by selling off specified state assets. The lesson for a future Greek government, or any present or future euro area government is clear: if you want to restructure your sovereign debt or restore sovereignty over fiscal policy, you simply cannot negotiate without a credible plan to reintroduce a national currency. Recent statements by the governments of Poland, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic that they are in no hurry to join the euro, if ever, indicate that this message is not lost on these increasingly successful, competitive economies. Present euro area members take note: failing to prepare an alternative currency Plan B is preparing to fail in future negotiations. The time to plan is now, before the probably inevitable arrival of the next euro sovereign debt crisis.

    "webTitle": "Npower profits plunge 60% amid ongoing billing problems", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Profits at npower have tumbled 60% as it struggles with billing problems which have sent customer complaints soaring. Many customers have been receiving late bills or no bills at all, since npower introduced a new billing system in 2013. Npower, which is owned by the German utility RWE, revealed on Thursday that it had lost more than 300,000 customers over the past year, with many remaining customers using less energy. The company, which is one of the UK\u2019s largest energy suppliers, does not expect to solve the billing problems until the end of 2016, despite last year\u2019s warning from the regulator Ofgem to fix the issue by August 2014 or not take on new customers. The company insisted it was taking the right steps and said complaints had fallen to the lowest level since December 2011. At one time, hundreds of thousands of people were left unsure of how much they owed, which prompted Ofgem last month to rule that customers who had waited more than 28 days would get free energy until the problem was solved. The Ofgem investigation, which began over a year ago, is continuing and could also lead to fines. Npower was one of the most complained-about energy companies in 2014 and 2013, with customer problems still running high in the first half of 2015. The consumer watchdog Ombudsman\u2019s Services reported in June that the majority of energy market complaints related to npower and Scottish Power, although the number of consumers contacting the ombudsman has fallen since the start of the year. Npower blamed billing problems for a 60% fall in UK profits: the company earned \u20ac53m (\u00a338m) in the first six months of 2015, compared with \u20ac133m the year before. \u201cThe main part of our drop in profits has been due to the continued impact of the systems issues that hit our domestic business last year,\u201d the npower chief executive, Paul Massara, said. \u201cThe challenges that we have faced were tougher than we expected but we know what the problems are and are taking the right steps to fix them. \u201cAlready this year, we\u2019ve made real improvements for our customers, halving the number of complaints we receive, meaning complaints are at their lowest level since 2011.\u201d RWE revealed in its half-yearly report that it was \u201coften only able to retain residential customers with expired contracts by offering them new contracts with more favourable conditions\u201d. The billing saga is a another headache for RWE, Germany\u2019s second-largest utility company, which is grappling with low prices for the fossil fuels that dominate its business model. RWE has a relatively small renewables business \u2013 6% of annual electricity production \u2013 meaning it benefits less from favourable policies to promote renewable energy. The energy giant said it was experiencing a \u201ccrisis in conventional electricity generation\u201d, amid declining gas and coal prices. Coal prices have been falling because of a slump in demand from China, dragging down the price utilities can charge for electricity across Europe. Gas prices, which closely track oil prices, have also fallen, offsetting stronger demand that came from colder temperatures in 2014, compared with the previous year. In Germany, gas prices are down 1-5% and in the UK by 4-8%, prompting npower rival British Gas to announce a 5% cut in prices. RWE pointed to the low price of power, as well as problems in the UK, as it unveiled an 11% decline in profits to \u20ac2.03bn. This \u201csignificant underperformance\u201d on market expectations made it the worst performer in the energy sector, according to analysts at RBC Capital Markets. In a letter to shareholders, RWE chief executive Peter Terium also complained about the German government policy to phase out the most-polluting coal-fired power stations. Berlin wants to phase out lignite by 2021, although it was criticised by the Greens for abandoning plans for a climate change levy on the lignite-mining industry of the Rhineland. Terium said the debate over lignite made RWE \u201clook like a football team that has been forced on to the back foot and robbed of its ability to play a free-flowing game\u201d. He added that the company was continuing to embark on growth projects, listing electricity supply in Slovenia, building up electricity and gas business in Poland and Hungary, as well as expansion of its renewables business via offshore windfarms.",

The company is also expected to open 10 more cinemas before the end of the year, taking its total number of screens to more than 2,000. Cineworld\u2019s shares have climbed 19.5p or 3.5% to 568p, and analysts are positive on the outlook. N+1 Singer said: [The] interims have surprised on the upside this morning and the full year outlook is expected to be better than management previous expectations. We envisage 3-5% consensus upgrades this morning and lift our 12 month target price from 550p to 600p and stay at buy on growth considerations. Nick Batram at Peel Hunt said: The first half was a slight beat and leaves room to nudge numbers higher. However, the potential scale of the second half mega blockbusters presents an opportunity for more material upgrades later in the year. Supporting a positive film slate is the ambitious (and largely secured) estate expansion programme. Given this, we expect Cineworld to continue to deliver premium earnings per share and dividend per share growth versus the broader leisure sector. Canaccord Genuity said: The higher mix of adults flocking to cinemas to be entertained by blockbusters, Jurassic World, Fifty Shades and Fast &amp; Furious is a key reason behind Cineworld\u2019s stellar first half with Star Wars, Bond and the final Hunger Games all slated for the fourth quarter. We are looking at an indicative 6% upgrade to 28.4p for 2015 and a 5% upgrade to 31.4p for 2015. We are hiking our target price to 620p from 540p. Cineworld has recovered from its recent share price wobble and is set for another surge in performance, we believe.",

      "bodyText": "Holiday company Tui Travel has revealed that the Tunisian beach attacks cost it as much as \u20ac40m (\u00a328m) in cancelled bookings and empty hotel costs. Of the 38 people killed on the beach at Sousse in June, 33 were on a Tui package holiday, as were many of the injured. Peter Long, joint-chief executive of Tui, said the human tragedy had dominated the firm\u2019s business over its most recent financial quarter. \u201cThese were the most horrific events that I and my company have ever had to deal with,\u201d he told journalists. \u201cI and all my colleagues still remain in deep shock about the tragic loss of life and injuries to our customers. \u201cOur priority has been to support our customers, their families and our colleagues impacted by these horrendous event and this will continue. I am immensely proud of the commitment and dedication that we as an organisation have collectively shown.\u201d The company, which owns First Choice and Airtours, said the attacks had cost it \u20ac10m in repatriation costs and cancelled bookings in June, although the total bill rose to around \u20ac35m-\u20ac40m once the cost of empty hotel rooms in Tunisia was counted. Within hours of the attacks, Tui put 18 extra flights in the air to bring home customers. The company also expanded its summer holiday programme, adding 26 new flights to destinations in Spain, Cyprus and Bulgaria to allow customers bound for Tunisia to rebook holidays. Before the attacks Tui sent half-a-million tourists a year to Tunisia, with the North African country accounting for 3% of total bookings. In a blow to Tunisia\u2019s struggling tourist industry, Long said there were no guarantees it would restart holidays in Tunisia once Foreign Office advice on travel to the country changes. \u201cWe will not make a decision regarding recommencement of our [Tunisia] programmes until the Foreign Office advice is lifted and they say it is safe to travel again. And then, to be quite frank, there will be a combination of our thoughts about that and what our customers are telling us about their desire to go back to the country.\u201d \u201cWhilst we remain mindful of the importance of tourism to the country \u2026 in terms of the depth of sorrow within our organisation, we are incredibly concerned about security for our customers.\u201d Despite the attacks in Tunisia, Tui reported 18% growth in earnings on last year, to \u20ac194m for the three months ending 30 June, due to strong demand from the UK and an increase in long-haul bookings to destinations such as Mexico and Jamaica. The company also managed to shrug off the Greek financial crisis, with bookings for Greece up on last year. Although Tui recorded a slowdown in bookings in late June when Greece teetered on the brink of financial meltdown, the company said bookings had since recovered and were now running higher than last year. Asked about whether the crisis in Greece had eaten into company takings, Long said: \u201cWe don\u2019t think there is an impact for Greece.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China\u2019s central bank sought on Thursday to allay fears it would engineer a continued fall in the yuan in a move that brought calm to global markets rocked this week by a shock series of devaluations. The People\u2019s Bank of China said the yuan was close to market levels following three successive declines that stoked fears of a currency war should the US and Japan respond by pushing down their exchange rates. There is \u201cno basis for persistent and substantial devaluation\u201d, said a deputy central bank governor, Zhang Xiaohui, at a hastily convened news conference on Thursday. Zhang said the yuan, also known as the renminbi, was close to \u201cmarket levels\u201d after three days of declines that knocked more than 3% off its value. \u201cThe central bank has the ability to keep the renminbi basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level,\u201d she said. China cut the reference rate for its currency for the third straight day on Thursday, having taken markets by surprise on Tuesday with the yuan\u2019s biggest one-day devaluation in 20 years. The central bank put the yuan\u2019s central rate - from which it can deviate 2% in a single day - at 6.4010 yuan for $1, a drop of 1.11% from the previous day\u2019s 6.3306. Beijing said Tuesday\u2019s move was aimed at allowing the yuan to float more freely in line with market rates. It fell again on Wednesday and during most of Thursday to 6.3870. Shockwaves from the devaluation had spread through financial markets, sending stocks and Asian currencies tumbling. But shares across Asia rose on Thursday after the Chinese central bank\u2019s assurances. Japan\u2019s Nikkei shrugged off early losses and downbeat capital expenditure figures to end 1% higher at 20,595.55. European markets gained almost 2% before falling back when strong US retail sales indicated that interest rates would probably rise in the autumn, attracting money away from equity markets to interest bearing deposit accounts and bonds. The FTSE 100 gained almost 50 points in early trading before finishing the day at 6568, down 2.8 points. \u201cThere is a degree of calm returning to the market,\u201d Mitul Kotecha, head of Asia-Pacific FX strategy for Barclays in Singapore, told Reuters. \u201cThe market certainly perceives that the Chinese authorities don\u2019t want the [yuan] to weaken too dramatically.\u201d Thursday\u2019s central bank comments came after analysts said allowing market forces free rein could drive the yuan sharply lower. \u201cIt is very possible that we could see a 10% to 15% drop in the exchange rate against the US dollar in the next week or two,\u201d said Duncan Innes-Ker, of The Economist Intelligence Unit. Susan Joho, an economist at the bank Julius Baer, said she expected the yuan to depreciate, possibly as low as 6.8 to the dollar, \u201cwhere the currency would reach an undervaluation similar to the euro\u2019s\u201d and then stabilise. Investors interpreted Beijing\u2019s move as an effort to benefit its exporters, though some economists rejected that view, arguing that weak global demand meant there was little benefit in driving the currency lower. Yet after a decade of little or no movement, the change rattled financial markets and threatened to fan political tensions with Europe and the US. While the International Monetary Fund welcomed Beijing\u2019s support for market forces, the change was expected to prompt complaints in the US Congress that Beijing was manipulating its currency to gain a trade advantage. Nicholas Teo, of CMC Markets warned the move could trigger a new currency war if central banks responded by trying to depress their country\u2019s own exchange rates. China was exporting \u201cdeflationary pressure\u201d, said Morgan Stanley analysts Hans Redeker, Ian Stannard and Sheena Shah in a report. \u201cThis is not a marginal event, given China\u2019s economic weight.\u201d China\u2019s economic growth rate slowed to 7% last year, according to official figures that many analysts believe underplay the country\u2019s recent economic downturn. Some analysts believe growth in 2014 was little more than half the official rate and this year will be no better after a fall in world trade. Beijing\u2019s move could complicate the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision about when to raise interest rates that have been near zero since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Fed was expected to act later this year, possibly as early as next month. A weaker yuan would reduce the price of Chinese goods, pushing down already-low US inflation of 1.3%. The Fed wants to be \u201creasonably confident\u201d inflation is returning to its 2% target before raising rates. A 4% drop in the yuan is unlikely to affect its decision, but a 10% dive would probably take a rate rise off the table.",

      "bodyText": "Figures released on Wednesday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that wages grew by a record low amount in the past year \u2013 just 2.27% for private and public workers together. For workers in the private sector alone, wages grew by just 2.20% \u2013 another record that continues the poor run of below-average growth. The annual growth of 2.27% dipped low enough to just break the old record set in the March quarter of 2.29%. It now means wages growth has been below average for two and half years, with little sign of turning: The growth of wages was weak across the board. In the private sector, wages grew by just 0.5% for the second straight quarter. The public sector had slightly better growth in the quarter of 0.57% growth (in trend terms). Far from being a good sign, that was actually the lowest quarterly growth in public sector wages ever seen: The private sector experienced better wages growth if you include bonuses (0.8% in the quarter) but the growth including bonuses is pretty erratic \u2013 in the June quarter it was zero. The better wage rises when you include bonuses could be an indication that companies are keeping pay growth low and instead transferring pay rises into bonuses. But even if you include bonuses, the annual growth of 2.7% is nothing to write home about, unless you\u2019re in the mood to write to your parents about how low your wage rise has been in the past year: Given the fairly decent news about employment growth, the low wage growth is just another mystery to add into the odd assortment of employment data we have been getting lately. As Justin Smirk, senior economist with Westpac Economic Research noted, the recent increase in hours worked would usually be accompanied by an improvement in wages growth, but instead the opposite has occurred: Since September 2013, the total number of hours worked has increased, yet during that period growth of wages has continued to slow. The Reserve Bank referred in its recent statement on monetary policy to this conundrum of low wages growth at a time when employment and hours worked is improving. \u201c[Several] factors explain the decline in wage growth\u201d, and among these are the \u201cincrease in spare capacity in the labour market\u201d, it said. While more hours are being worked overall, the increase is in effect only starting to fill the gap of capacity in the labour market. If we look at employment and hours worked since the middle of 2012, it\u2019s clear that the number of hours worked has not kept pace with actual employment growth. This in itself is not a bad thing. It is far better for this to occur than for employment to fall with hours worked, as that would mean people are being sacked rather than just having their hours reduced. But it also means that now that the number of hours worked is increasing, we still have a long way to go before our labour capacity is reached. One aspect that certainly points to the level of spare capacity in the economy is the very weak growth of wages in the construction sector: Despite the housing boom in Sydney and some other capital cities, the decline in construction work in the mining sector has meant that construction workers are not exactly scarce. As a result, wages in that industry grew by just 1.75% in the past year \u2013 the second slowest growth of all industries and well down on the 4% growth the industry was experiencing in 2012: If there is one small bright side to this continuing news of weak wages, it is that \u2013 as I noted last month \u2013 the rise in cost of living is also historically weak. With the cost of living for employee households growing by just 0.9% in the past year, that makes the real wages growth a not too shabby 1.4%: That is actually much better than the 15-year average of 0.6% annual real wages growth. But it is mostly temporary. The fall in petrol prices, the drop in electricity prices due to the end of the carbon price and the interest rate cuts have mostly driven the low rise in the cost of living. Once these wash out of the system \u2013 which has occurred with electricity and petrol prices \u2013 the rise in the cost of living will pick up. Not by much, but enough to slice significantly into real wages growth. The low wages growth highlights that for all the talk from the government about the need for greater flexibility in the industrial relations system, the current system is proving to be remarkably flexible \u2013 much more so than in the past. The RBA has noted that, compared with previous periods of weak economic growth, \u201cincreased labour market flexibility may have provided firms with more scope to adjust wages\u201d. It concluded that \u201cin any case, very low wage growth appears to have contributed to more employment than would otherwise have been the case.\u201d The issue of course is while this flexibility helped keep wages down while demand in the economy was weak, will this flexibility also result in increased wages growth when demand returns? Or are we stuck in a \u201cnew normal\u201d of low wages growth?",
