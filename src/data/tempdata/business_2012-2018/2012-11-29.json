It's never been terribly persuasive since HMV and Waterstones continue to struggle even after the disappearance of Woolworths, Borders, Zavvi, and others. But how about Dixons? Will life be easier in a post-Comet world? Up to a point. Seeing your major competitor disappear, or at least shrink substantially, has to be helpful. Comet has annual sales of \u00a31.2bn so, if Dixons can grab just a fifth of the spoils, its stores should get a \u00a3240m uplift. Crucially, this gain should come at decent profit margins since the rent on the stores has to be paid anyway. Seymour Pierce's analyst calculates that Dixons should enjoy an extra \u00a329m in operating profit at least. Very nice, especially as Dixons, after years of struggle, seems to have knocked its UK operation into better shape: today's \u00a35.6m profit in the UK &amp; Ireland was the first at the half-year stage for half a decade. But this is no time for Dixons' new boss, Sebastian James, to celebrate rivals' woes. He's got a pile of his own troubles in the group's \"southern Europe\" division. The Italian operation is too small and the Greek business would be excellent if only it were in a different country. But the worst of the lot is Pixmania, a monument to the former management's hubris in thinking it could get ahead in the internet game by investing in a French-based pan-European distributor of everything from electricals to jewellery. To no surprise, expansion in Albania, one of 29 countries served, has not made the numbers improve. Dixons has been obliged to buy full control of Pixmania in an attempt to impose order and stem losses. Do not expect a quick fix. Still, Dixons is definitely a survivor. This year's big event was the repayment, via a refinancing, of a dangerous-looking bond. That represented substantial progress, and the share price had started to react even before administrators arrived at Comet. You could have bought into Dixons in January at 11p, so today's 25.7p makes the shares one of the top performers of 2012. But remember, once upon a time they traded at 280p.

      "body": "<p>Invensys got a corker of a price from Siemens for its rail signalling division, everybody agrees. And it's true that \u00a31.7bn in cash looks like silly money for a business that made operating profits of \u00a3116m last year on turnover of \u00a3775m.</p> <p>Invensys' share price rose by a third in response for good reasons. The deficit in the group's pension fund is more than eradicated; shareholders can have \u00a3625m directly; and there's even a few hundred million left over to invest, assuming nobody turns in the interim to bid for what remains \u2013 essentially a controls division and a software automation business.</p> <p>So how come shares in Siemens didn't slump after this supposed display of German financial indiscipline? Well, Siemens is a giant company, so even an \"overpriced\" \u00a31.7bn deal can get lost in the wash, especially when it's unveiled on the same day as other re-jigs, including a sale of unwanted odds and ends. Even so, Siemens shareholders clearly don't think their management has lost its marbles in making Invensys investors' dreams come true.

      "bodyText": "Invensys got a corker of a price from Siemens for its rail signalling division, everybody agrees. And it's true that \u00a31.7bn in cash looks like silly money for a business that made operating profits of \u00a3116m last year on turnover of \u00a3775m. Invensys' share price rose by a third in response for good reasons. The deficit in the group's pension fund is more than eradicated; shareholders can have \u00a3625m directly; and there's even a few hundred million left over to invest, assuming nobody turns in the interim to bid for what remains \u2013 essentially a controls division and a software automation business. So how come shares in Siemens didn't slump after this supposed display of German financial indiscipline? Well, Siemens is a giant company, so even an \"overpriced\" \u00a31.7bn deal can get lost in the wash, especially when it's unveiled on the same day as other re-jigs, including a sale of unwanted odds and ends. Even so, Siemens shareholders clearly don't think their management has lost its marbles in making Invensys investors' dreams come true. Siemens' share price actually ticked upwards modestly. This may be a classic case of German shareholders being less sniffy than their British counterparts about long-term \"strategic\" deals. Paying 15 times operating profits looks other-worldly on City yardsticks \u2013 but it really depends on your horizon. Siemens wants to be in the rail signal business for decades.

      "bodyText": "The fear that haunts the Bank of England is that Britain could become the next Japan. Permeating the whole of Threadneedle Street's latest update on the state of the financial sector is the conviction that, as with Japan in the 1990s, the sickness of the banking sector could throttle the life out of the economy. With Britain already half way through its own lost decade, the Bank's financial policy committee believes immediate action is needed that will force lenders to improve their financial resilience. If the warning sounds far-fetched, then compare and contrast. Britain had a long period of growth that ended with a massive property bubble. So did Japan. The UK banks lent far too much than was wise in the 2000s to property companies against too little capital. In doing so they followed a trail blazed by Japanese banks two decades earlier. When Britain's party finally ended, the result was an economic wasteland of over-indebted consumers and over-leveraged banks. In a repeat of Japan's experience, the credit taps were turned off and growth shuddered to a halt. Japan ended up with a zombie economy in which zombie banks were lending to zombie companies. Firms that would in normal circumstances have gone bust were kept on life support by lenders who themselves were kept in the realm of the living dead courtesy of easy credit and softly-softly financial regulation from Tokyo. Worryingly, the UK is showing signs of heading in the same direction. One in 12 companies are able to repay only the interest on their debts and between 5% and 8% of mortgage payers are able to stay in their homes only because lenders are going easy on them. The Bank is particularly concerned about the commercial property sector, which accounts for half of all commercial loans. One third of commercial real estate loans by value are subject to some sort of forbearance, and losses could be higher than lenders are estimating. To make matters worse, the Bank thinks accounting rules are allowing lenders to systematically underestimate risks when assessing loans, and that they will eventually face a much higher bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance than they have so far admitted. The Bank was coy yesterday on putting a figure on the total capital shortfall faced by the big UK banks, but on some estimates it could be close to \u00a360bn. Threadneedle Street wants banks to raise more capital without choking off lending to the economy, something which is easier said than done. The state has a big stake in two of the biggest UK banks \u2013 RBS and Lloyds banking group \u2013 and George Osborne has made it clear that he is not going to ask the taxpayer to stump up more capital. With investor confidence in banks at a low ebb, drumming up enthusiasm for rights' issues could be tough. King says there are other ways round the problem, such as banks selling off non-core parts of their business or by raising money through contingent capital \u2013 debt instruments that can be converted into equity in periods of stress. Bank shares rose slightly yesterday because there had been concern that King would specify what individual banks would have to do and by when. It would be a mistake, however, to believe that the issue of bank capital has been kicked into the long grass. The FPC is deadly serious about this because until the banks are sorted out the economy will remain in limbo. Raising interest rates will mean that the policy of \"extend and pretend\" towards non-performing loans will have to end. Banks will have to be robust enough to cope and at the moment they are not. So, the Bank means it all right. The real question is why it has taken it so long to get tough.",

In a move that was quick to cause confusion \u2013 and was quickly debunked by foreign lenders \u2013 the government used last week\u2019s EU summit to announce that it had already struck a deal with creditors. The announcement prompted outrage over what the price of such aid would be with powerful trade unions pledging to fight the measures.</p> <p>But Shiarly made clear that the negotiations were far from over, predicting the \u201cdiscussions over the next few weeks will be difficult, perhaps more so than before.\u201d However, he refused to be drawn on how much the lifeline would be despite widespread speculation that it could amount to \u20ac17.5bn - more than the island\u2019s GDP.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50b78f59b579ff47064199c2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-29T16:37:45.899Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over to Spain, and Moody's has said the recent moratorium on evictions weakens the financial position of the country's banks.

All well and good so long as there are sellers willing to take such a hit. But are there?</p> <p>OpenEurope has <a href=\"http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Article/Page/en/LIVE?id=9629&amp;page=PressReleases\">taken a look</a> at who owns the bonds and what the prospects of them selling are. OpenEurope says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In reality we expect that only the \u20ac30bn of foreign held debt would be available for purchase.</p> <p>This still fits with the \u20ac10bn in funding and the price of 35 cents on the euro and could deliver up to \u20ac20bn in debt reduction (around 11% of GDP), if all these bondholders took part.</p> <p>However, it is unclear how many of these bondholders would wish to sell. Some will be holding the bonds to maturity and will not want to accept any further write downs, while others may be happy to wait for a default and take the case to court due to the new Greek bonds being governed under English law. In any case the debt reduction may be much lower.</p> </blockquote> <p>The success of the buyback is key because the IMF for one has made it clear its continuing participation in the bailout is reliant on this policy being implemented.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TradeDesk_Steve/status/274174167333601280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>IMF Weekly press conference: Will evaluate execution of Greece debt buybacks ahead of Dec 13 before putting the program before the Board</p>&mdash; Steve Collins (@TradeDesk_Steve) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TradeDesk_Steve/status/274174167333601280\" data-datetime=\"2012-11-29T15:33:10+00:00\">November 29, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/274174470879584256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>IMF: Greek Debt Buyback Success Critical For Fund Support</p>&mdash; DJ FX Trader (@djfxtrader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/274174470879584256\" data-datetime=\"2012-11-29T15:34:22+00:00\">November 29, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-29T15:40:51.822Z\">at 3.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50b77c8395cbe67db8cad498\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-29T15:17:24.199Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">OECD calls for Spain's partners to be clear on aid</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The OECD said Spain's European partners should clearly state aid would be available if the country needed it.</p> <p>Secretary general Jose Angel Furria said at a press conference with the country's economy minister Luis De Guindos that it was important that activating the ECB's bond buying programme remained an option.

The expansion was led by the consumer, government spending, inventory building and, to a lesser extent, exports. With the fiscal cliff set to hit government spending and drive up taxes in the new year, the expectation is that consumer and government spending could move in to reverse and drive the economy back into recession.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"A slowing trend already looks likely in the fourth quarter due to storm disruptions and because business confidence has sunk to its <a href=\"http://www.markit.com/assets/en/docs/commentary/markit-economics/2012/nov/Global_Outlook%20_PMI_12_11_12%20news%20release.pdf\"> lowest for a year</a>, hit in particular by uncertainty caused by the looming fiscal cliff and ongoing worries about the euro zone crisis.

      "bodyText": "European markets have now closed, and with Greece and Spain's immediate problems seemingly sorted out and optimism about US budget discussions, the mood is pretty positive. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished up 67.02 points at 5870.30, a 1.15% rise \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.78% \u2022 France's Cac has closed 1.53% higher \u2022 Spain's Ibex is up 1.74% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is 2.81% better \u2022 But Athens has slipped 0.8% And in the US, after an early rise the Dow Jones Industrial Average has now turned negative following rather more pessimistic comments about the forthcoming fiscal cliff from House speaker John Boehner. He said there had been no substantive progress in talks between the Democrats and Republicans in the past two weeks, dashing hopes that an agreement was not far away. On that note, we'll call it quits for another day. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. Cyprus has tried to clear up some of the confusion surrounding developments over its own request for a bailout from the EU and IMF. Our correspondent Helena Smith, who has been covering the story from Athens, explains: Addressing the Cyprus parliament, finance minister Vassos Shiarly said while the island had come to a \u201cpreliminary agreement\u201d with international creditors at the EU and IMF, a final deal would rest on the outcome of an assessment of recapitalization requirements of local lenders which had sustained heavy losses through their exposure to debt-stricken Greece. With the analysis of the capital needs expected to be completed by 7 December, Shiarly said it was likely Cyprus could agree to the deal by mid December - leading the way for the first injection of rescue funds to prop up banks by the end of January. In a move that was quick to cause confusion \u2013 and was quickly debunked by foreign lenders \u2013 the government used last week\u2019s EU summit to announce that it had already struck a deal with creditors. The announcement prompted outrage over what the price of such aid would be with powerful trade unions pledging to fight the measures. But Shiarly made clear that the negotiations were far from over, predicting the \u201cdiscussions over the next few weeks will be difficult, perhaps more so than before.\u201d However, he refused to be drawn on how much the lifeline would be despite widespread speculation that it could amount to \u20ac17.5bn - more than the island\u2019s GDP. Over to Spain, and Moody's has said the recent moratorium on evictions weakens the financial position of the country's banks. The agency said: [The law passed this month] will reduce the level of recoveries expected through November 2014 and increase the time delay before the creditor can materialise recoveries following the sale of the repossessed property. Some Reuters snaps from a speech by the ECB's Jens Weidmann (head of the Bundesbank) in Berlin: \u2022ECB'S WEIDMANN - EURO ZONE CENBANKS HAVE ALREADY DONE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO FIGHT DEBT CRISIS \u2022NOW UP TO STATES TO TACKLE ORIGINS OF CRISIS, TO PUT STATE FINANCES IN ORDER, SHAPE-UP ECONOMIES, MAKE BANK SYSTEM SOLID \u2022IF GREECE DOES NOT IMPLEMENT REFORMS AND IMPROVE BUDGET SITUATION, IMPACT OF AID MEASURES WILL EVAPORATE \u2022GREEK AID AGREEMENTS MUST NOT SET A PRECEDENT \u2022ON BANK UNION, SAYS BANKS' LEGACY ASSETS SHOULD BE COVERED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE GOVTS Another snippet from Greece. Croatia, which is set to join the EU next summer, has just had some bad news. Following the country's draft 2013 budget, ratings agency Fitch has moved its outlook from stable to negative. Fitch said: Croatia's recently-announced draft 2013 budget proposes an increase in the consolidated general government's fiscal deficit from an estimated 3.5% of GDP in 2012 to 3.8% of GDP in 2013. The public finances remain a key rating driver and Fitch considers a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan to be necessary to put debt dynamics on a sustainable path. The revision to a Stable Outlook in September 2012 was based on the government maintaining a tight medium-term fiscal stance in line with the Fiscal Responsibility Law in 2012. The new budget contradicts the medium-term fiscal strategy and also calls into question the credibility of the brand-new Fiscal Responsibility Law, which calls for an annual cut in spending of 1% of GDP until a primary balance is achieved. Fitch had previously assumed that the government would follow through with its July plan. Back with the Greek bond buyback, and a key question is, who will sell their holdings at 35% or so of what they paid? As part of the debt deal agreed this week, Greece is expected to use some \u20ac10bn to buy back around \u20ac30bn of bonds. All well and good so long as there are sellers willing to take such a hit. But are there? OpenEurope has taken a look at who owns the bonds and what the prospects of them selling are. OpenEurope says: In reality we expect that only the \u20ac30bn of foreign held debt would be available for purchase. This still fits with the \u20ac10bn in funding and the price of 35 cents on the euro and could deliver up to \u20ac20bn in debt reduction (around 11% of GDP), if all these bondholders took part. However, it is unclear how many of these bondholders would wish to sell. Some will be holding the bonds to maturity and will not want to accept any further write downs, while others may be happy to wait for a default and take the case to court due to the new Greek bonds being governed under English law. In any case the debt reduction may be much lower. The success of the buyback is key because the IMF for one has made it clear its continuing participation in the bailout is reliant on this policy being implemented. The OECD said Spain's European partners should clearly state aid would be available if the country needed it. Secretary general Jose Angel Furria said at a press conference with the country's economy minister Luis De Guindos that it was important that activating the ECB's bond buying programme remained an option. He said it was the certainty of the support which was key for Spain, Reuters reported. The OECD said in a report that the prospect of a quick recovery in Spain remained remote. Meanwhile De Guindos said the sale of one of the country's nationalised lenders, CatalunyaCaixa, was expected to be completed in the early months of 2013. More signs of life in the US housing market. Pending home sales - that is, contracts to buy previously owned homes - rose more than expected in October, despite hurricane Sandy and worries about the US fiscal cliff. The National Association of Realtors said its pending home index had climbed 5.2% to 104.8 when analysts had been expecting a 0.8% increase. The news, along with earlier positive GDP and jobs figures, has helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average by more than 53 points at the moment. Greece is likely to offer bondholders different prices depending on the bond, as part of its debt buyback, a Greek official has said. The bond buyback is a key part of this week's bailout deal, and it needs to succeed for the other pieces to fall into place. But according to a Reuters report: Questions have arisen over whether Athens will attract enough interest from bondholders, who have the choice of whether or not to participate in a deal that is needed to ensure Greek debt is deemed sustainable in the coming decade. The deal, clinched at the third attempt after weeks of wrangling, removes the biggest risk of a sovereign default in the eurozone for now, ensuring the near-bankrupt country stays afloat. The terms of the buyback will determine its success. \"It makes sense for it to happen in that way,\" the senior official told Reuters when asked if the 20 eligible Greek bonds would be offered at different prices rather than at a uniform price. Some reaction in now on the US figures. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, warns that the numbers could be the best we see for a while: \"The US economy grew faster than previously thought in the third quarter, but the pace of expansion set to be the best we will see for a while. Austerity measures to be introduced in the new year are set to dampen some of the key factors that have helped boost the economy so far this year. \"Gross domestic product rose at an annualised rate of 2.7%, up from the initial estimate of 2.0% and above the 1.3% pace seen in the second quarter. The expansion was led by the consumer, government spending, inventory building and, to a lesser extent, exports. With the fiscal cliff set to hit government spending and drive up taxes in the new year, the expectation is that consumer and government spending could move in to reverse and drive the economy back into recession. \"A slowing trend already looks likely in the fourth quarter due to storm disruptions and because business confidence has sunk to its lowest for a year, hit in particular by uncertainty caused by the looming fiscal cliff and ongoing worries about the euro zone crisis. Manufacturing also continues to be affected by weak export sales, with the underlying trend in output estimated to have been flat in October after allowing for a 0.9% drop in production resulting from Hurricane Sandy. Durable goods orders were likewise unchanged during the month. \" And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. The US economy grew quicker than expected in the third quarter. The commerce department said GDP grew at 2.7% at an annual rate, greater than the 2% estimated by the government last month. This was due to companies building up stocks more quickly than thought but is not expected to be sustained as the nation prepares for tax increases and spending cuts. The number of Americans making new claims for unemployment benefits also dropped for the second week running. The labour department said initial claims for state benefits dropped 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 393,000. US GDP for the third quarter revised up to 2.7% Apparently there's some big news coming at 1.30 so here's a quick round up of the day so far. \u2022 Markets are up quite strongly on hopes of a breakthrough on the US budget impasse. The FTSE is currently trading 52 points, or 0.9% higher at 5855. \u2022 Bond yields in struggling eurozone countries are down helped by a successful italian auction this morning. \u2022 The ECB has succeeded in keeping secret files showing how Greece manipulated its debt figures before the crash. In Ireland, what's left of Anglo Irish Bank is suing the bank's former auditors, Ernst &amp; Young. The state-owned bank, which is now called Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, issued proceedings on Tuesday, according to high court records in Dublin. IBRC said the case relates to the firm\u2019s role as auditors before the bank\u2019s nationalisation but it would not give any more details. As promised a while ago, more on the intriguing story that the ECB will not be forced to reveal secret papers showing how Greece hid its debts (see 9.41am). Our reporter Julia Kollewe has been looking at the story and writes: Talk that Goldman Sachs is taking over the world one central bank at a time was fuelled by the news that the ECB has won a ruling to refuse access to secret files showing how Greece used derivatives to hide its debt. \u201cDisclosure of those documents would have undermined the protection of the public interest so far as concerns the economic policy of the EU and Greece,\u201d the European Union general court in Luxembourg said, rejecting a challenge by Bloomberg News brought under the EU's freedom of information rules. The ECB is of course headed by a former Goldman banker, Mario Draghi. The EU court ruling comes just after another ex-Goldmanite, Canada's Mark Carney, was appointed governor of the Bank of England. Goldman Sachs (and other investment banks) have been criticised by European leaders over allegations that they helped Greece disguise the true scale of its debts over several years. German chancellor Angela Merkel said in February 2010: \"It's a scandal if it turned out that the same banks that brought us to the brink of the abyss helped to fake the statistics.\" -- Bond yields are going down all over Europe, as Lord Grey didn't say on the eve of an altogether more serious crisis in 1914. But as a leading politician of his day I'm sure he was a keen student of the bond markets and would have been interested to know that not only are Italian and French borrowing costs falling, but also those of Spain, Belgium, Greece and Portugal. Here are the numbers for 10-year bonds: France - 2.048% Belgium - 2.19% Italy - 4.527% Spain - 5.28% Portugal - 7.527% Greece - 16.428% UK gilts by contrast are up slightly at 1.79%. The CBI brings us positive news from the high street. Retailers said year on year sales rose for the third consecutive month and saw an increase in staff on the shop floor, according to the CBI. The CBI\u2019s latest quarterly distributive tades survey covers the first two weeks in November and revealed that year-on-year growth in retail sales volumes continued for a third consecutive month, with +49% of retailers reporting an increase in their volume of sales compared with a year ago, and +16% a reduction. The resulting balance of +33% is the highest since June this year (+42%) and slightly ahead of expectations (+27%). Not bad news considering the ongoing carnage at Comet. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic analysis, said: 'This months\u2019 survey is reason to be cheerful as we head into the festive period. Retailers across the board will be heartened by these encouraging results. The increase in employment, along with expectations for improvement in the business situation over the next quarter, point to a welcome boost to the sector.' And talking of Mr Carney, there is some evidence today of the fine job he's been doing on Canada's financial sector. The Royal Bank of Canada said today that it made a record profit in the last financial year of C$7.5bn - up 17% on the year before helped by fixed income and loan growth. It's a simple game. Jill and Larry have filed some words from the press conference down at the Bank of England. There will undoubtedly be more, including the moment when Paul Tucker ducked the question on whether he would stay put at the bank after being passed over for the big job this week. Italian benchmark 10-year bond yields have hit a 2-year low today on the back of this week's deal on Greek debt. At auction earlier this morning Italy sold \u20ac2.98bn of 10-year bonds, just shy of the maximum targeted amount, and paid a yield of 4.45% on Thursday, down almost 50 basis points from an end-October sale. A year ago, Italy paid a record 7.56% to get 10-year bonds away. French borrowing costs have also fallen today. The yield on 10-year bonds is at 2.04%, which defies both Moody's downgrade of two weeks ago and predictions of the French economy imploding. Good sport down at the Bank of England where the FT's Chris Giles asked jilted would-be governor Paul Tucker if he would be staying on in his job. 'I'm deputy governor for financial stability. There's a job of work to be done and I'm doing it,' came the testy reply. There will be a full story on the Bank's half-yearly financial stability review shortly but in the meantime our reporters Jill Treanor and Larry Elliott are down at Threadneedle Street listening to a press conference from Sir Mervyn King. The governor says that the FSA will begin immediately to assess the banks' need for more capital But, as Jill has just tweeted, King is stressing that the taxpayer will not have to front up more cash for the banks. The Treasury doesn't want to put more in either. Phew. The Bank of England says the FSA should re-assess the capital requirements of Britain's banks. The Bank's financial policy committee said that bad debts are worse than thought in some cases and that the banks face rising fines and costs for misconduct. Confidence in the eurozone's economic prospects rose for the first time in a year in November according the European Commission's monthly business and consumer survey. Economic sentiment in the euro zone rose a greater than expected 1.4 points to 85.7, ending an eight-month run of falls. Less cheery news is that the Commission's survey of industry found expectations of a 1% fall in real investment in 2013 compared with this year, casting doubt on the prospects for growth next year. The EU's general court has blocked an attempt to force the ECB to release files showing how Greece used derivatives to hide its debt in the run-up to the crisis. The case was brought by Bloomberg under freedom of information in August 2010 but has been thrown out today by the court in Luxembourg. A bad day for those interested in finding out how Europe got into such a terrible fiscal mess. More on this shortly. More mildly encouraging news from eurolandia where Italian business confidence rose to 88.5 in November compared with 87.8 in October. That's slightly better than expected. Data for the whole of eurozone coming at 10am. That news will add to confidence in the markets where the FTSE 100 is now up a healthy 45 points at 5848, a rise today of 0.8%. Other European bourses are feeling the love too. The Dax is up 0.79% and the Cac 1.09%. German unemployment stayed at 6.9% in November. Figures just out showed that the jobless total rose 5,000 - better than the 16,000 expected by forecasters. Sorry for the digression. Back to base, sort of, and Kingfisher, Europe's biggest home improvements retailer, has warned today that the situation in its large French business is \"very uncertain\". Sales at the division which includes Castorama and Brico Depot were down more than 9.3% for the third quarter and will fuel the idea that France could be the next eurozone struggler. It's a pretty quiet start today in euroland so I'm going to head back to the proverbial clifftop. In particular I was struck by this report from Reuters about the Pentagon's chief buyer Frank Kendall telling US arms manufacturers that despite the forthcoming financial armageddon, 'don't worry, there's still plenty of money to be made from selling us weapons'. He's obviously concerned about American jobs etc but shouldn't he be lowering companies' expectations of fat contracts if the government wants to cut the debt a bit? Eisenhower famously warned about the perils of the military-industrial complex in his presidential valediction in 1961 and it has been a staple of conspiracy theorists ever since. Optimism over the US situation is quite tentative. Reuters cites Republican House speaker John Boehner as saying that his party could broker a deal with the White house while President Barack Obama said that he thought it could be done by Christmas. And there is also more signs of optimism in Europe where eurozone leaders hare clearly trying to be more conciliatory towards Greece than in the past few months. My evidence for this is an interview given by Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte in which he concedes that Greece may need more financial aid to stay in the 17-nation pact. He tells Bloomberg: Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, is entirely right that you have to take a view on the situation of Greece every couple of years again, whether we are on track and whether extra steps have to be taken.' Which contrasts with this sort of thing. The FTSE is duly up 26 points as I type at 5829, a rise of 0.45% as investors, for now at least, follow the lead of those Asian markets. The Dax in Frankfurt is up 0.63% while the Cac in Paris has improved by 0.68%. Good morning and welcome to the eurozone crisis live blog. Graeme Wearden is having a well-earned day off so I'll be bringing together the key elements on the story today. Markets in Europe look set to be up this morning on growing optimism that the US can avert falling off the fiscal cliff. Asian markets pointed the way overnight with Japan's Nikkei 225 index rising 0.7 % to 9,377.91. Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 1.1% 1.1 percent to 21,942.92 and South Korea's Kospi added 0.9 percent to 1,930.15. On the data front, there is German unemployment at 8.55am, which is forecast to be up slightly and then eurozone business and consumer confidence indicators at 10am. There should be some interesting stuff out of the UK's half-yearly financial stability review at 10.30 and then there's US Q3 GDP at 1.30pm.",

      "bodyText": "Currys and PC World owner, Dixons Retail, said it expects to benefit from the demise of Comet as its UK operations returned a profit for the first time in five years. However, poor sales in its southern Europe branches due to the eurozone crisis and a \u00a342.5m writedown of its online gadget business, Pixmania, saw the company slump to a \u00a379.5m pre-tax loss in the six months to October, compared with a \u00a32.4m profit a year earlier. Chief executive Sebastian James said: \"We were particularly busy during the sporting and cultural events during the summer. While August and September were, as expected, a bit quieter, we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook. \"We are outpacing our competitors, and have seen Comet enter administration in the UK and Expert exiting the market in Sweden.\" Comet could be wiped off the high street within weeks unless a buyer is found to save the stricken business. On Wednesday administrators from Deloitte said 125 stores would start closing from Monday, with the remaining 70 under threat. Around 3,500 jobs have gone, with 1,000 left. Administrators added that finding a buyer was looking unlikely. As a result of Comet's collapse, Dixons' share price has soared, trading at a three-and-a-half year high. Dixons has also offered temporary Christmas jobs to some of those left unemployed by Comet. Revealing its results on Thursday morning, Dixons said: \"We have seen further consolidation in the UK &amp; Ireland market, most notably with Comet entering administration since the end of our first half. While there may be some disruption while Comet completes the fire-sale of its stock in the short term, Currys and PC World will benefit from the consolidation.\" The company's UK business was particularly impressive, with sales up to \u00a31.59bn for six months, from \u00a31.57bn during the same period last year. It meant underlying operating profit was \u00a35.6m, from a \u00a36m loss in 2011 \u2013 the first time in five years. This came at a cost though, with 42 stores closed since the beginning of the financial year, with up to 98 more set to shut, leaving a total of between 400 \u2013 420 sites. Many of the separate standing PC Worlds and Currys were combined into one store, with many undergoing an upgrade and redesign. Sales were up 3% in the UK, however, at its operations in some of the hardest-hit European areas of Greece, Italy and Turkey, sales fell 9%. But the biggest hit was taken on its online retail Pixmania business, particularly in France where it ended a licensing agreement with French firm Bouygues Telecom. Dixons has bought the remaining stake in the company that it didn't own and taken on day-to-day running of the struggling business. It said: \"Sales and profit performance has been poor ... It is clear that Pixmania requires significant attention to improve its financial position. We have quickly initiated steps to significantly reduce the complexity and costs of the business and to enable Pixmania to focus on core activities. The actions being undertaken, in compliance with local laws, will take time. We believe these steps are necessary to improve the financial position of Pixmania going forward.\" Meanwhile, there was some positive news in the UK retail sector as B&amp;Q owner, Kingfisher, saw sales in the country increase 5.7% during the three months to end of October, compared with a year earlier. However, poor sales in France and a weak exchange rate saw overall revenues down 3.9% to \u00a32.7bn, with profits hit by 5.9% to \u00a3257m. B&amp;Q saw a fall in sales of 4% to \u00a3906m due to, what it called \"the generally weak consumer backdrop in the UK and a particularly challenging environment in Ireland.\" But its Screwfix business saw sales jump 10.9% to \u00a3139m as it opened 12 new stores, bringing its total to 252. Kingfisher chief executive, Ian Cheshire, said: \"Our markets remain challenging, with consumer confidence still weak and so we maintain our strong focus on margin, costs and cash.\"",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers have ordered UK banks to make a more \"honest\" assessment of hidden losses on their balance sheets and warned they will be forced to find ways to fill a shortfall that could be up to \u00a360bn. Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, insisted that taxpayers would not be forced to plug any blackhole at the bailed-out banks. Chancellor George Osborne had made it clear, he said, that the government would not add to the \u00a365bn already ploughed into Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. King called for banks to make an \"honest and open statement\" of what is lying on their balance sheets as the Bank's new financial policy committee (FPC) \u2013 set up to avoid a rerun of the 2008 banking crisis \u2013 called on the City watchdog to conduct a \"proper valuation\" of bank loans. Andrew Bailey, the Financial Services Authority regulator who sits on the FPC, immediately began to contact bank bosses to begin the process which will eventually lead to banks publishing how much capital they need to raise and how they intend they do so. They might choose to raise new cash, sell or close parts of their business or issue a new type of financial instrument known as contingent capital (Cocos). There was a muted reaction in bank shares, as the remarks by the governor were interpreted as reducing the need for cash calls on investors, which shareholders had feared after previous quarterly meetings of the FPC. The policymakers are concerned about three main areas: the way that banks are offering leniency to customers in arrears \u2013 a process known as forbearance; the scale of potential losses resulting from fines and compensation linked to mis-selling scandals such as payment protection insurance; and the way international capital rules allow them to set aside asset capital against the risk of the loans they hold. The Financial Stability Report, published on Thursday,, estimated the total financial cost of those three factors at up to \u00a315bn, \u00a310bn and \u00a335bn respectively \u2013 a grand total of \u00a360bn. However, the Bank governor stressed he was \"not giving a single number\" as this would be \"misleading\" and would depend on the circumstances of individual banks. The bottom end of the estimates produces an estimated \u00a324bn shortfall. The UK's banks already have higher capital ratios than any of their rivals but the FPC is concerned about absolute amounts of capital. \"We're not saying, tomorrow morning, be out there with the collecting tins,\" said King. He added that while the subject needed to be addressed with urgency it was manageable for the banks. Deputy governor Paul Tucker, who this week lost out in the race to succeed King next summer when Geroge Osborne appointed Canadian Mark Carney, said: \"The watch word here is capital adequacy. There is no magic ratio. Capital adequacy requires that banks have honest balance sheets and they shouldn't be constrained by accounting policies,\" said Tucker. Current accounting rules do not allow banks to take provisions for estimates of future losses, only for losses that can be accurately forecast. Tucker said banks need to set money aside on the basis of estimate of future losses. He gave a testy response when asked about his own future: \"I'm the deputy governor of the Bank of England. There's a job of work to be done. I'm doing it.\" King also closed down any attempts to ask Andy Haldane, another senior bank official, about his personal plans following the appointment of Carney, current governor of the Bank of Canada. Another senior Bank official, Andy Haldane, admitted the FPC was \"concerned\" about the way banks are making provisions linked to the leniency they are offering to borrowers in the commercial property sector \u2013 which accounts to 50% of all business lending. A survey by insolvency practioners R3 shows that more than one in 12 UK companies can only pay the interest on their debts and would not be able to keep up their repayments if interest rates were to rise. A third of all commercial property loans have received some sort of forbearance. Some one in 12 mortgage customers are being helped with their repayments. The policymakers argue that one of reasons the share prices of the big banks are lower than their value of their assets \u2013 at the end of June the discrepancy was \u00a390bn \u2013 is because investors are worried about potential bombs hidden on their balance sheets.",
