      "bodyText": "There is little that annoys the Australian business community, its media spruikers and the Liberal party more than being shown how badly they perform. The best example of this is the superannuation industry where once again it has been revealed that industry funds have comprehensively outperformed those run by banks. Little wonder then that instead of attempting to improve, the business community is instead crying foul and trying to destroy the entire system. This week, superannuation research house Chant West released the results of fund performances over the 2017-18 financial year. And yet again the news was not good for bank-run retail funds. Not one of them made the top 10, and industry funds once again dominated. The best performing fund was Hostplus, which is mainly for employees in hospitality and tourism. This will be of little surprise to anyone who has been paying even the slightest attention to the superannuation industry. Industry super funds have consistently and repeatedly outperformed retail funds. Perhaps we are being too hard on the retail funds \u2013 maybe the top 10 is just an outlier. Fortunately, Chant West also has the average performance of industry and retail funds broken down into time periods. And whether we use one month, a quarter, a year, three, five, 10 or 15 years, industry funds on average have had better rates of return than retail funds. If you didn\u2019t know better, you would almost think retail funds are more concerned with generating profits for their shareholders than returns for their fund members. The recent Productivity Commission report into the superannuation industry was just one of the latest to find that industry funds outperformed retail funds. The report, which looked at the performance of individual funds, found that more than half the retail MySuper funds were underperforming \u2013 and worst of all, they were the biggest of such funds; the minority of industry funds that were underperforming were among the smallest of the type. As I noted at the time, most people in dud MySuper funds are in retail funds, and most people in retail MySuper funds are in dud funds. Not that Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, the minister for revenue and financial services, would admit to such a thing. In one of the more bizarre interviews, O\u2019Dwyer could not bring herself to acknowledge to Sky News\u2019 David Speers that retail funds were being whipped. Speers asked O\u2019Dwyer a dozen times whether \u201cindustry funds systematically outperformed for-profit funds\u201d and she would not answer, preferring only to say that \u201cindustry funds on the whole have performed very well and I agree with that\u201d. One might also argue that Queensland did not lose the State of Origin but NSW performed very well. It\u2019s always an issue when your arguments crash into the wall of reality. You either have to face up to it, or you refuse to acknowledge it exists. It makes for embarrassing interviews and worse public policy. But O\u2019Dwyer has been ably abetted in this abject rejection of facts by the business community, led by the Business Council of Australia. Its executive director, Andrew Bragg, laughably suggested in an op-ed in theAustralian Financial Review that industry super funds were becoming the equivalent of \u201cSuper PACs\u201d in the United States, that had a \u201cwar chest\u201d of \u201cconsiderably political influence\u201d. When Industry Super Australia\u2019s chair, Peter Collins, wrote to the BCA pointing out the errors in Bragg\u2019s conspiracy theories, the response was apoplectic. The BCA chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, suggested the letter was an attack on \u201cfree speech\u201d, while the former BCA president Tony Shepherd, taking a big sip from the hyperbole glass, suggested it was evidence of \u201ca decline in moral and ethical standards in the west\u201d. Rather wonderfully, Bragg\u2019s article, which ended with the suggestion that changes were needed to be made to industry super funds because \u201cworkers are waiting for better value\u201d, linked to an article by journalist Adele Ferguson. In that article, Ferguson cited research by the former head of research at the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, who found that if the $577bn worth of assets in retail super funds \u201chad been managed in the same way as industry funds, retail super members would be better off about $15.5bn a year\u201d. Oops. It\u2019s the problem with those trumpeting the need for industry super to change \u2013 the actual lack of evidence that it is not working. The concern within the industry is that in the face of overwhelming defeat, the retail sector would rather blow up the system entirely by moving to one default fund \u2013 say the Future Fund \u2013 than to a system recommended by the Productivity Commission, which would inevitably see dud retail funds frozen out. The Productivity Commission considered such an option and found that it would introduce \u201can actual or implied government guarantee in the Australian superannuation system\u201d that would not necessarily produce the best outcomes. It argued that it would lead to more conservative investment strategies designed to avoid the government needing to \u201ctop up\u201d the fund than actually see fund members get the best returns. And for the past 15 years, the best returns have come from industry funds. Yes, there are big problems with multiple superannuation accounts, and people paying for insurance that is mostly not needed. But overwhelmingly the problem with the superannuation industry is the retail side. No amount of conspiracy theories have been able to disguise the fact that compared with industry super funds, the banks, which presumably are the experts in generating wealth, have been thrashed. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond, under pressure to ease austerity, must spend the summer preparing the ground for sweeping tax rises that catch everyone in their net. A tax on the rich is not going to be enough to meet the demand for \u00a320bn extra on health spending by the end of the parliament, let alone the cost of extra police officers to tackle a significant rise in crime, higher social care funding and a boost to the defence budget. Whether you focus on the richest 1% or even the best-paid 10%, the exchequer needs more cash than high earners can supply: that seems to be the thinking inside the Treasury. All households must pay something towards these necessary budget increases. It won\u2019t be revealed until the autumn budget what taxes Hammond thinks we should pay more of. His plan could be a shock-horror rise in the standard 20p rate of income tax or a higher rate on national insurance. Then again, he may prefer taking aim at consumption taxes like VAT and fuel duty. The chancellor has already tapped extra revenues from stealth taxes \u2013 the little-known surcharges that became widely used during Gordon Brown\u2019s reign at No 11. We are all paying higher insurance premiums thanks to sharp increases in insurance premium tax in the last two years. This revenue stream helped the public finances. Yet it was just a drop in the ocean. After eight years of austerity there are holes in public services that need filling and it will take big money to do it. Likewise, welfare benefits are crying out for a cash injection, if only to keep pace with inflation. A boost to health spending has already been singled out by the Treasury\u2019s official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), as an unfunded commitment that will upend current budget projections. Almost every department has its hand out begging for more funding, and all with legitimate claims. James Brokenshire, the housing and communities secretary, must go to bed at night relieved that all 418 councils he oversees met their statutory duties that day, especially those concerned with keeping children safe. Most local authority finance directors believe that the day is nearing when government cuts eat into their ability to deliver the most basic of services. Another area desperately short of funds is social care. The OBR chairman, Robert Chote, said last week that should the government agree on a deal over social care funding, it would cost the health department more money than it currently spends. This must be true when most older people pay for their own care and a deal would cap that amount, leaving the state to pick up the rest of the cost. Universal credit is another claim on the pubic purse. This week the Resolution Foundation will illustrate the power of the credit to raise incomes and reduce child poverty. This government has severely cut tax credits since 2012 in the hope that wage rises would fill the vacuum. They haven\u2019t, harming family incomes and pushing up child poverty. It would take many billions of pounds to reverse this trend, just as it would take tens of billions to inject enough funds to maintain public services over the coming years, let alone improve them. There are different routes out of this mess. The UK government can continue selling off assets to foreign buyers, much as Premier League football clubs do to raise funds. There are private schools selling parts of themselves to the Chinese to fund expensive developments. Maybe state schools will follow? Universities are increasingly in hock to foreign sponsors. It might not be long before one of the top-ranked institutions adds the word Emirates to its name. Hospital trusts are in the midst of a fire sale of land expected to bring in several billion pounds. Network Rail is preparing to sell all the commercial space under its arches to get the cash today rather than the rental income in perpetuity. Alternatively, the state can borrow. There are local authorities raising bonds to keep themselves afloat. And the government itself could borrow more, especially as the chancellor is on target to reduce the annual spending deficit to below his target of 2% in this financial year. Hammond seems optimistic that amid the tense and possibly chaotic votes expected in October over Brexit, he will be allowed to throw away the Tory manifesto and its ban on mainstream tax rises. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the architect last year of a rebellion over a \u00a31.2bn national insurance rise on the self-employed, will be too distracted to care, goes the thinking. It seems far-fetched, to say the least. Which leaves the UK selling its assets and using its borrowing power to make ends meet.",
