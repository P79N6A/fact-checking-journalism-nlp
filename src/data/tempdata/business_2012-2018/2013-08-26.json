      "bodyText": "An influential group of MPs has stepped up its drive to have Royal Bank of Scotland split up, amid concerns that Whitehall officials could back away from the proposal. Members of the parliamentary commission on banking standards have demanded that plans go ahead to split the operations of the troubled institution, which is 81% owned by the taxpayer, into a so-called good bank and bad bank, in a bid to speed up its recovery and the sale of the government's stake and to help it increase business lending. The split, which is designed to take toxic loans off its balance sheet and place them with a state-owned bank, has the backing of former Bank of England governor Mervyn King and the former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson. The chancellor, George Osborne, has asked for a report by advisers Rothschild and Blackrock Solutions on whether the plan is likely to work, but reports suggest the inquiry has found little evidence that the bank's lending capacity is being constrained by bad debts and it is believed the bank sees the proposed changes as unnecessarily complex. The commission, chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, now fears Whitehall officials and the chancellor himself will sweep the proposals under the carpet to avoid disrupting the bank's recovery. It has written to the Financial Times insisting on a speedy resolution. In the letter, the commission writes that it is \"important for all the options for [RBS's] future structure to be examined as a matter of urgency\".

      "bodyText": "Pubs, hotels, restaurants, accountants and legal firms have enjoyed their strongest three months of trade since the beginning of the financial crisis, strengthening hopes that the UK economy is heading into a solid recovery. A quarterly survey of the service sector by the CBI, the business lobby group, found the highest proportion of business and professional service firms reporting a rise in business volumes since November 2007 and the most positive outlook on profits since February 2008. A total of 31% of the companies surveyed, which include accountants, lawyers and marketing firms, said business volumes rose, against 11% saying they had fallen \u2013 giving a positive balance of 20% for the quarter to August, the best reading since the early days of the financial crisis. Optimism about the future was at a 15-year high, with a balance of 22% of companies saying they planned to hire staff and 39% expecting to expand their business. Among consumer services firms, such as hotels, bars and travel companies, a balance of 15% saw a rise in business volumes and a balance of 28% were optimistic about their prospects as the UK celebrated a warm and sunny summer. But these companies said increased business was not translating into more jobs. They expected to continue to cut staff and rein in investment over the next quarter after profits unexpectedly fell back at the fastest rate for over a year as hoped-for price rises failed to come through. A balance of 11% said they had cut the number of people they employed and 24% said they would cut more jobs in the coming three months. Stephen Gifford, the CBI's director of economics, said: \"We've seen a further build-up of momentum in the service sector this quarter, with business and professional services firms in particular seeing a turnaround in their fortunes. \"Confidence has risen strongly across the board, and the outlook is positive in the short term. But consumer services firms are a bit more worried about the longer term, and have scaled back their investment and expansion plans.\" The picture is well illustrated by the experience of British visitor attractions. The Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, which represents venues from the British Museum to Blackpool Pleasure Beach, said its members had seen a 22% rise in visitor numbers this spring and summer compared with last year thanks to good weather, the legacy of the 2012 Olympics and the relative strength of the euro against the pound, which has encouraged visitors to cross the Channel. But director Bernard Donoghue said visitor attractions were having to offer deals and keep prices down despite rising food and energy costs. \"Visitor attractions know that where they do charge, the proposition has to be really attractive to appeal to a hard-pressed consumer,\" he said. The CBI's largely positive survey of 161 businesses follows figures published last week that have boosted hopes the UK is heading into a strengthening recovery. On Friday the Office for National Statistics upgraded its estimate of economic growth in the second quarter of this year to 0.7% from 0.6%, making it the strongest three months since Britain got a temporary boost from the Olympics in 2012. The figures indicated a broad-based bounceback as the improving economic climate in the eurozone lifts demand for British exports, while an uptick in the housing market and a decent summer had boosted consumer confidence. Tesco and its market research partner, Dunnhumby, released figures over the weekend suggesting that consumer confidence is at its highest level for at least three years. They found that the proportion of consumers agreeing that the economic situation in the country had improved in the last few months had risen to 21% in July from 10% in April, while the proportion feeling that pressure on their finances was increasing dropped to 33% from 41%. Last week, the CBI said it expected the economy to grow by 1% this year after releasing positive figures for the manufacturing sector. Philip Clarke, chief executive of Tesco, suggested that good weather and Britain's sporting success over the summer, when Andy Murray won the Wimbledon tennis championship and England's cricketers secured the Ashes, had helped consumers feel more confident. But he warned: \"The underlying picture is complex and it's not yet clear if the recent improvements in consumer confidence are thanks to these short-term factors, or part of a more significant shift.\" Stephen Gifford at the CBI said: \"Conditions remain tricky as households grapple with the prolonged squeeze on real incomes and business confidence remains vulnerable to any adverse developments in the global economy.\" Signal aim The Bank of England's deputy governor, Charlie Bean, said its forward guidance policy was \"communicating not just to market participants, but to \u2026 households and businesses, to give them a clear signal that interest rates are not likely to rise imminently\". Bean told Bloomberg: \"What we're trying to do is explain as clearly as we can what are the factors that will guide policy going forward, recognising the world is an uncertain place.\" He added that he was a little surprised at the reaction to the plan in financial markets, which have pushed up yields on British government bonds. The yield on a 10-year government gilt \u2013 a good guide to the long-term cost of borrowing \u2013 has been rising since Mark Carney advised that interest rates were on hold at least until the unemployment rate came down to 7%. Carney gives his first public speech in the UK as the central bank's governor on Wednesday and is expected to challenge those in the City who think inflation will force the Bank's hand, despite its forecast that continued high unemployment will mean interest rates stay at record lows until 2016.

      "bodyText": "The US will hit its borrowing limit in mid-October and would likely be unable to pay all its bills soon after, the Treasury warned on Monday. In a letter to Republican House speaker John Boehner that sets the stage for another round of budgetary brinkmanship, Treasury secretary Jack Lew said: \"Congress should act as soon as possible to protect America's good credit.\" Lew warned failure to act soon could do \"irreparable harm\" to the US economy. Government officials and economists had been expecting the US to reach its $16.69tn \"debt ceiling\" this autumn, but mid-October is earlier than some had expected. The news comes as Congress prepares for yet another fight over whether or not to raise the debt ceiling in the coming weeks. Lew said the Treasury would reach its borrowing limit by mid-October and would then be left to fund the 80m payments per month, including military salaries and social security cheques, with a cash balance estimated at $50bn. \"Operating the government with no borrowing authority, and with only the cash on hand on a given day, would place the United States in an unacceptable position,\" he wrote.

Last month, Boehner said: \"We need significant cuts in spending if we are going to replace the sequester and extend the debt limit.\" The White House has said that it will not negotiate over whether the borrowing limit should be raised and has called on lawmakers to move quickly. Political deadlock ahead of a debt ceiling raise in 2011 led to a historic downgrade of US debt and stock market panic. Lew attempted to see off Republican arguments tying another rise in the debt ceiling to government spending. \"Extending borrowing authority does not increase spending; it simply allows the Treasury to pay for expenditures Congress has previously approved,\" he wrote. \"Failing to raise the debt limit would not make these bills go away,\" he said. \"It would, though, have disastrous effects for our nation.\" The government hit its borrowing limit in May, but the Treasury has used emergency measure to buy more time.

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail chief Moya Greene bemoans 'broken' pay-setting for bosses", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pay-setting in government-backed companies is \"hopelessly broken\", according to Royal Mail's \u00a31.5m-a-year chief executive, who in an unguarded email also criticised a \"highly politicised\" atmosphere surrounding corporate governance. Moya Greene's candid communication was sent to a member of the public who had voiced concern about her being offered a \u00a3250,000 housing allowance, and who shared it with the Guardian. The postal chief also complained about what she called the aggravating role of the media as she sought to explain why the lucrative perk had been offered to her, and why she had decided to hand it back. In her email, which Royal Mail confirmed was genuine, Greene, a Canadian, said she was \"deeply offended\" by the criticism that had come her way over pay and benefits. She added that she was unimpressed with the amount of time it had taken ministers and civil servants to settle her remuneration. \"I took on a company in grave difficulty,\" she wrote. \"I was here for a full 15 months before officials and/or ministers deigned to explain the exact basis upon which I would be paid. I had long resigned my previous position. \"The actual practise [sic] for setting and applying agreed compensation arrangements for [chief executive officers] in commercial companies involving government shareholding is hopelessly broken here,\" she wrote on 5 August. Greene, a former civil servant and businesswoman in Canada who took over at Royal Mail in the summer of 2010, has been steering the formerly loss-making 497-year-old service towards an expected privatisation. The Communication Workers Union said in August her pay was \"imitating private-sector excess\" after a Royal Mail report showed she received a 33% rise last year to bring her pay, including pension contributions, to \u00a31.47m. The business secretary, Vince Cable, had also expressed his concern about the relocation payment, which Royal Mail's independent remuneration committee of non-executive directors approved. After Cable's comments, Greene offered to hand back the money, which, she wrote, had been offered \"in good faith\". In her email, Greene added: \"The climate for executives and their abilty [sic] to manage in the UK remains highly politicised, all aggravated by a press corp whose general traits have been well set out by Mr. Justice Levinson [sic].\" But she also robustly defended her track record. With her at the helm, Royal Mail moved from losing money in 2010-11 to generating \u00a3334m of cash in 2012-13.

      "body": "<p>Pay-setting in government-backed companies is \"hopelessly broken\", according to Royal Mail's \u00a31.5m-a-year chief executive, who in an unguarded email also criticised a \"highly politicised\" atmosphere surrounding corporate governance.</p> <p>Moya Greene's candid communication was sent to a member of the public who had voiced concern about her being offered a \u00a3250,000 housing allowance, and who shared it with the Guardian.</p> <p>The postal chief also complained about what she called the aggravating role of the media as she sought to explain why the lucrative perk had been offered to her, and why she had decided to hand it back.</p> <p>In her email, which Royal Mail confirmed was genuine, Greene, a Canadian, said she was \"deeply offended\" by the criticism that had come her way over pay and benefits. She added that she was unimpressed with the amount of time it had taken ministers and civil servants to settle her remuneration.</p> <p>\"I took on a company in grave difficulty,\" she wrote. \"I was here for a full 15 months before officials and/or ministers deigned to explain the exact basis upon which I would be paid. I had long resigned my previous position.</p> <p>\"The actual practise [sic] for setting and applying agreed compensation arrangements for [chief executive officers] in commercial companies involving government shareholding is hopelessly broken here,\" she wrote on 5 August.</p> <p>Greene, a former civil servant and businesswoman in Canada who took over at Royal Mail in the summer of 2010, has been steering the formerly loss-making 497-year-old service towards an expected privatisation. The Communication Workers Union said in August her pay was \"imitating private-sector excess\" after a Royal Mail report showed she received a 33% rise last year to bring her pay, including pension contributions, to \u00a31.47m.</p> <p>The business secretary, Vince Cable, had also expressed his concern about the relocation payment, which Royal Mail's independent remuneration committee of non-executive directors approved. After Cable's comments, Greene offered to hand back the money, which, she wrote, had been offered \"in good faith\".</p> <p>In her email, Greene added: \"The climate for executives and their abilty [sic] to manage in the UK remains highly politicised, all aggravated by a press corp whose general traits have been well set out by Mr. Justice Levinson [sic].\"</p> <p>But she also robustly defended her track record. With her at the helm, Royal Mail moved from losing money in 2010-11 to generating \u00a3334m of cash in 2012-13. She wrote: \"In Royal Mail as a commercial company with a public mission we have a long way to go \u2026 but it is certainly more stable now \u2026 able to offer thousands of people, 150,000 in fact, good jobs with salaries and benefits far superior to that available elsewhere in our intensely competitive industry.\"</p> <p>Royal Mail declined to comment on \"individual correspondence\" but stressed that there was no breakdown in confidence with the government.

      "bodyText": "It says something about this election campaign that the only time the Liberal party\u2019s industrial relations spokesman, Senator Eric Abetz, has put his head above the parapet it was to announce policy measures that were quickly denied by others in the party. In an extraordinary change of policy, Senator Abetz told the Australian last week that the Liberal party was going to introduce more regulation into the IR sector. He was concerned about pay rises that were negotiated and agreed to by workers and employers. He told the paper: \u201cUnions pursuing agreements allowing for annual pay rises of, for instance, 5%, should be required to show to the Fair Work Commission that they had \u2018genuinely discussed\u2019 productivity with their employer before the deal is approved.\u201d Why did he think this was needed? Well, because Australia\u2019s businesses were weak and lazy. He said that the Liberal party wanted to bring in this arrangement to ensure \u201cthat lazy companies don\u2019t just give wage increases because it\u2019s the easiest thing to do, and the path to least resistance\u201d. It must be heartening to the CEOs around Australia to know that the Liberal party thinks so highly of them that it believes they would agree to pay rises that are not sustainable. As economist Sinclair Davidson wrote on the Libertarian blog Catallaxy Files: \u201cWe already have a perfectly good mechanism for dealing with those firms that give their employees productivity-free pay increases \u2013 it is called bankruptcy.\u201d The next day, Fairfax papers revealed that Abetz was talking out of turn and had been told to go back to where he had till then been hiding himself this campaign. But Abetz\u2019s thought bubble (or inadvertent revelation of future plans) reveals a common complaint about the industrial relations system that has existed even before the Fair Work Act came into effect \u2013 namely, that it will provoke a union-led wages blowout. But two weeks\u2019 ago the latest Wage Price Index was released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics; it showed that the annual increase in wages is a mere 3% \u2013 the lowest such increase, outside the period of the global financial crisis, for the past 10 years.
