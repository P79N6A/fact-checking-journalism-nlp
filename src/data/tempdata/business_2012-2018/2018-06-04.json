      "bodyText": "The bosses of England\u2019s privatised water companies have been criticised for banking \u00a358m in pay and benefits over the last five years while customers have been faced with above-inflation rises in their water bills. The GMB union said the chief executives of England\u2019s nine water and sewage companies were \u201cfat cats\u201d earning \u201cstaggering sums\u201d from the management of a natural resource. Tim Roache, GMB\u2019s general secretary, said the pay awarded to water bosses was a national scandal and launched a campaign to return the industry to public ownership. Household water bills have risen by 40% above inflation since the industry was privatised in 1989, according to a National Audit Office report. The average bill this year will be \u00a3405, a 2% increase on last year, according to Water UK, the trade body that represents water and sewerage companies. \u201cIt\u2019s a national scandal that over the last five years England\u2019s hard-pressed water customers have been forced to splash out \u00a358m through their bills to go into the pockets of just nine individuals,\u201d Roache said. \u201cPrivatisation of the water industry has been a costly mistake and these eye-watering sums are further proof the water industry must be returned to public hands. \u201cThe GMB is urging people and politicians to Take Back the Tap and make our water services work for the many and not the few.\u201d Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cClearly the only people privatised water companies work for are the big bosses who are cleaning up at the expense of bill payers. It\u2019s scandalous that the government is sitting idly by while households continue to face skyrocketing water costs. \u201cLabour will end their failed ideological experiment and bring water companies back into public ownership, saving households \u00a3100 per year on their bills.\u2019\u2019 Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has also attacked water companies for paying their bosses large salaries and huge dividends to shareholders while contributing little or no tax. \u201cOne might hope that companies making such massive profits, paying out such big dividends and supporting such generous executive salaries, would be big contributors to the exchequer through their tax bill,\u201d Gove said in a speech to industry executives earlier this year. \u201c[But instead we have had] 10 years of shareholders getting millions, the chief executive getting hundreds of thousands, and the public purse getting nothing.\u201d He said Anglian Water and Southern Water paid no corporation tax last year, while Thames Water \u201chas paid no corporation tax for a decade\u201d. Ofwat, the industry regulator, said that it had repeatedly told water companies that they must do more to make sure executive pay better reflects customer service. \u201cWe have been very clear that we want to see water company executives rewarded for delivering for customers \u2013 not just shareholders,\u201d an Ofwat spokesman said. Liv Garfield, the chief executive of Severn Trent, was paid \u00a32.45m last year, making her the UK\u2019s best-paid water company boss. Garfield took home a salary of \u00a3674,000, a \u00a3615,000 bonus, and long-term incentive shares worth \u00a3975,000, a pension contribution of \u00a3168,000 and other benefits worth \u00a318,000. Garfield\u2019s total pay was down slightly from \u00a32.49m in 2016, as her bonus decreased by \u00a386,000. Following public and political pressure Severn Trent included \u201ccustomer experience\u201d in its bonus calculations last year. But the new metric only accounts for 8% of the total bonus compared to 47% for meeting profit targets. Over the past five years, Severn Trent has paid Garfield and her predecessor, Tony Wray, \u00a310.5m. The company, which serves 4.5m across the Midlands, said: \u201cOur priority is to perform for our customers, and our performance on those measures that matter most to our customers, such as preventing sewer flooding, has been strong. Executive pay is based on a range of challenging performance targets and is in line with pay at companies of a similar size.\u201d The second-highest paid water company boss, according to GMB\u2019s research, is the United Utilities chief executive Steve Mogford, who collected \u00a32.3m. His pay has increased by 49% since 2013. A company spokesperson said: \u201cThe vast majority of Steve Mogford\u2019s remuneration is linked to the delivery of stretching targets aimed at further improving customer service, operation delivery and environmental performance. In 2017, his total remuneration was approximately half the average for a FTSE 100 CEO.\u201d",

Schultz, who has been outspoken on political and social issues, has long attracted speculation that he will run for office, potentially as a Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. In a memo to staff, he did little to squash those rumours. \u201cI\u2019ll be thinking about a range of options for myself, from philanthropy to public service, but I\u2019m a long way from knowing what the future holds,\u201d Schultz said in the memo. Schultz joined Starbucks in 1982 and has overseen the company\u2019s global expansion. The company has more than 28,000 locations across the world. Starbucks was rocked by scandal in April, following the arrest of two black customers at a store in Philadelphia. The two men were held after a store employee called police to say they were trespassing. The company temporarily closed more than 8,000 US stores after the arrest for racial bias training. The incident was a blow for Starbucks which had previously tried \u2013 with mixed success \u2013 to enter the racial inequality debate by having baristas write \u201cRace Together\u201d on its coffee cups. Schultz, 64, is estimated to be worth $3.1bn, according to Forbes. He has been an outspoken critic of Donald Trump, calling him \u201ca president that is creating episodic chaos every day\u201d. Schultz supported Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. He has championed a higher minimum wage, offered some Starbucks employees free college and been outspoken on some of the most divisive issues in US politics. Last year he addressed employees following the fatal race riot in Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cThe moral fiber, the values, and what we as a country have stood for is literally hanging in the abyss,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cWe are at a critical juncture in American history. That is not an exaggeration. We are at and facing a crucible in which our daily life is being challenged and being questioned about what is right and what is wrong.\u201d The company said Myron \u201cMike\u201d Ullman would be the new chairman of the board, upon Schultz\u2019s retirement. Schultz will keep the honorary title of chairman emeritus. \u201cI set out to build a company that my father, a blue-collar worker and world war II veteran, never had a chance to work for,\u201d Schultz wrote in a letter addressed to past and present Starbucks employees. \u201cTogether we\u2019ve done that, and so much more, by balancing profitability and social conscience, compassion and rigor, and love and responsibility.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Today the Reserve Bank is expected to once again keep interest rates on hold \u2013 marking 22 months straight of the cash rate being at 1.5%. Such low interest rates raise the question of housing affordability \u2013 surely such low rates mean it is a good time to be paying off a house? But the data shows that even with such record low rates people buying a house now face a much tougher task than did those in the 1990s, including those who experienced record high interest rates. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday Right now there is no sense of another rate rise coming soon. In January the market predicted by November this year the cash rate would definitely have been raised to 1.75%. Now that \u201ccertainty\u201d has been shifted out to September next year: For so long the cash rate has been at 1.5% that it is quite easy to forget just how abnormally low it is. Less than a decade ago, during the GFC, when the cash rate was lowered to 3% it was considered to be at \u201ccrisis levels\u201d. Now no one is even considering such a rate in the near future. We are living in a period of such low interest rates that it seems scarcely possibly that there was a time high interest rates were a worry. And yet 29 years ago this month in June 1989, the standard variable mortgage rate hit 17% \u2013 remaining there through to March 1990. Georgie Hay from the finance comparison website RateCity pondered, in light of the current low interest rates we are experiencing, whether or not Australians were better off now with interest rates well below that 17% level. It\u2019s a tough question because in that time much has changed. Back then interest rates were high, but so too was inflation \u2013 6.8% compared with 1.9% now: Consider as well that back then just 59% of married women aged 25-34 were in the labour force, compared with 75% now: But also a lower percentage of women of that age are now married and, overall, fewer people are working full-time, which means that average earnings are less connected to full-time earnings than they once were. It makes comparing house prices and household income tricky \u2013 especially as the ABS\u2019s survey of household expenditure only comes out every five years \u2013 and does not cover the period when rates hit 17%. But at least we can see that the share of household income going to mortgage repayments in 2015-16 was much higher than it was in the 1980s and even early 1990s: But the reality is that working full-time is still the most likely situation you need to be in to be able to afford to buy a property. So even though it is not a perfect measure, comparing the size of an average mortgage with average male full-time earnings remains a good way to get a regular measure of affordability \u2013 both of taking out a mortgage and then paying it off. In 1989, the average mortgage across the country was $66,200, or 2.3 times the size of average annual full-time male earnings of $28,444. With interest rates at 17%, that meant that a monthly mortgage repayment of $943.80 was equal to 39.8% of an average male\u2019s full-time earnings. In 2017, the situation has changed rather drastically. The average mortgage size last year across the nation of $374,100 was 4.3 times the $86,460 average male full-time earnings. But with a standard variable rate of 5.2%, the average monthly repayment on that mortgage was just 28.5% of monthly male full-time earnings: This of course is the average for the nation, but if we look at NSW only, we see a similar but more exaggerated picture. The ratio of mortgage to annual earnings in that state has gone from 2.8 to 5.3, while repayments have gone from a 47.5% share to now 34.7%: Certainly the 47.5% share of income going to mortgage repayments in 1989 is stunning, but such has been the increase in house prices this century, the share of income going to repayments has been higher since 2003 than it was for most of the 1990s. And while if you took out a mortgage in 1989 in Sydney you were on average going to be paying a huge share of your income in repayments, most people did not buy a house in 1989, and your repayments are based on your mortgage, which does not change, unlike the average monthly mortgage size. This means if, for example, you bought a house in Sydney in 1988 \u2013 when the average NSW mortgage was just $64,700 \u2013 you paid a huge whack of your income in repayments in 1989, but they very quickly fell as the cash rate plummeted from 17% in March 1990 to 4.75% in July 1993: This was also a period of solid wage growth. In the five years from 1989 to 1994, male full-time earnings rose 22%, compared with just half that in the five years from November 2012 to November 2017 (the caveat being you needed to keep your job during the 1990s recession \u2013 not the easiest of things to do). It meant that if you took out a mortgage in 1988, by 2001 your repayments were worth just 11.7% of average male full-time earnings. Much has changed with monetary policy since we had 17% interest rates. Interest rates are much lower now but house prices are much higher. So large has been the increase in house prices that rather than needing a 17% mortgage rate to chew up 47.5% of the earnings of a male full-time worker, now it would need a rate of just 8.5%. Were the cash rate back at the previously \u201ccrisis level\u201d of 3%, and the standard variable rate rose by the same amount, average mortgage repayments would account for 40.8% of male full-time earnings \u2013 higher than was seen in nine of the 10 years in the 1990s. And this is the problem for those looking to get into the housing market compared with those who had to cope with the massive interest rates of 1989 and 1990 \u2013 their mortgage was a lot less and their repayments were able to fall. Today\u2019s prospective buyers know interest rates are not going to fall by much, if at all, and yet their mortgage \u2013 and the repayments \u2013 are already huge compared with their income. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

Here's why | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are living in a period of such low interest rates that it seems scarcely possibly that there was a time high interest rates were a worry. And yet 29 years ago this month in June 1989, the standard variable mortgage rate hit 17% \u2013 remaining there through to March 1990. </p> <p>Georgie Hay from the finance comparison website <a href=\"https://www.ratecity.com.au/home-loans/mortgage-news/28-years-since-rates-17-per-cent-better-off\">RateCity</a> pondered, in light of the current low interest rates we are experiencing, whether or not Australians were better off now with interest rates well below that 17% level.</p> <p>It\u2019s a tough question because in that time much has changed. </p> <p>Back then interest rates were high, but so too was inflation \u2013 6.8% compared with 1.9% now: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mortgage rates and inflation\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ge5Eh/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Consider as well that back then just 59% of married women aged 25-34 were in the labour force, compared with 75% now:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Participation rate of women aged 25-34\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dHL6y/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But also a lower percentage of women of that age are now married and, overall, fewer people are working full-time, which means that average earnings are less connected to full-time earnings than they once were.<br></p> <p>It makes comparing house prices and household income tricky \u2013 especially as the ABS\u2019s survey of household expenditure only comes out every five years \u2013 and does not cover the period when rates hit 17%.</p> <p>But at least we can see that the share of household income going to mortgage repayments in 2015-16 was much higher than it was in the 1980s and even early 1990s:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Gross income and mortgage repayments\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wti7Q/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the reality is that working full-time is still the most likely situation you need to be in to be able to afford to buy a property. So even though it is not a perfect measure, comparing the size of an average mortgage with average male full-time earnings remains a good way to get a regular measure of affordability \u2013 both of taking out a mortgage and then paying it off.</p> <p>In 1989, the average mortgage across the country was $66,200, or 2.3 times the size of average annual full-time male earnings of $28,444.

    "webTitle": "UK government to sell \u00a32.6bn of RBS shares, Brexit hits UK construction- as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest RBS stake sale by the UK government could hit the bank\u2019s share price in the short term, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The RBS share price has bounced back from its slump after the EU referendum, but the taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at \u00a33.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of \u00a31.1 billion, or \u00a31.9 billion if you include the cost of financing. RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today\u2019s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. As if to emphasise the market uncertainty facing the RBS share sale - which should be priced overnight after gauging demand from institutions- European markets have lost their early gains. However they still ended, for the most part, in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.52 points or 0.51% at 7741.29 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.37% to 12,770.75 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.14% to 5472.91 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 22,009.95 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.22% at 9750.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.76%. Here\u2019s our story on the RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost \u00a32.6bn to City investors. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank\u2019s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state\u2019s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when George Osborne sold a first tranche at a loss of about \u00a31bn. The report is here: The share sale is due to take place this evening with an offering to institutional investors. Here is the full announcement from UK Government Investments, the body which manages the country\u2019s RBS stake: UKGI announces that it intends to sell part of HM Treasury\u2019s shareholding in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. The disposal of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares will be by way of a placing to institutional investors. The price at which the Shares are sold will be determined by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process. The book will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The Placing is expected to comprise of approximately 925 million Shares, representing approximately 7.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. As a result of the Placing, the overall size of HM Treasury\u2019s shareholding in the Company will be reduced from approximately 70.1% to approximately 62.4%. UKGI and HM Treasury have undertaken to the Bookrunners named below not to sell further shares in the Company for a period of 90 calendar days following the completion of the Placing without the prior written consent of a majority (by participation) of the Bookrunners. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc have been appointed to act as joint bookrunners in connection with the Placing. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited is acting as Capital Markets Adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal counsel to UKGI in respect of English and US law. Details of the Placing Price and the number of Shares sold will be announced in due course. Settlement and delivery of the Shares is expected to take place on 7 June 2018. At last week\u2019s annual meeting, the bank\u2019s finance director did not seem keen on the government selling shares at the moment. UK Government Investments has announced it will place 925m shares in RBS with institutional investors, representing about 7.7% of the bank. The move cuts its stake from the current 71%. Following last week\u2019s annual meeting of Royal Bank of Scotland , the government has announced it plans to sell \u00a32.6bn worth of shares in the taxpayer-owned bank. Wall Street is holding onto its gains but the picture is slightly different in Europe. Most markets have come off their best levels as we head to the close, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is in negative territory, down 0.33%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stocks have held on to some of their gains today, but the day has not gone entirely the bulls\u2019 way. While Italian concerns have receded from view, trade wars remain the big concern. Given the performance of US equities, which have outpaced their European brethren today, it looks like the market is, for now at least, more concerned that European stocks will be harder hit than their US counterparts. Overall however, risk appetite appears pretty solid for the day, especially when the lack of macro data is factored into the equation. Particularly encouraging has been the continued strength in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 only 1% away from its previous record high. Despite the renewed trade tensions, markets are making a good start to the week. But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring. The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cmegaphone\u201d diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors\u2019 enthusiasm for equities. The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don\u2019t think that Italy\u2019s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again. The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy. The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery. Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%. This is the worst April since 2012. The March figure was revised up from a 1.6% increase to 1.7%. The decline could be temporary, however, given some positive manufacturing surveys in May. Wall Street has followed the global trend, shrugging off trade war fears and moving higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or 0.76%, as investors continue to celebrate Friday\u2019s better than expected jobs numbers. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.45% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.37% higher. One of the companies moving higher is Apple, heading closer to a $1trn valuation: Over in Argentina, the International Monetary Fund has said talks about it giving financial support to the country were well advanced: Alejandro Werner, the IMF\u2019s Director of the Western Hemisphere department, said: IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have been engaged in a very constructive and close dialogue in response to the authorities\u2019 request for financial support for their economic plan. Talks are well advanced. As we have said all along, this will be a plan driven by the Argentine government\u2019s priorities, with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable, and strengthening the local economy in light of the recent financial market turbulence. Donald Trump has defended his new tariffs, arguing that he is actually fixing the playing field on global trade. The president has been rather active on Twitter this morning. Remarkably, he claimed he has the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to pardon himself (but won\u2019t, as he\u2019s done nothing wrong....). Investors should stay alert; Trump may be heading towards a titanic clash with special counsel Robert Mueller.... Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is signalling (finally) that it will not be signing up to Greece\u2019s third bailout programme, which is due to expire this summer. With less than three months before the debt-stricken county exits its current programme, the Fund says the likelihood of it contributing to the rescue package financially is fading fast. The Washington-based body had promised to boost the programme \u2013 Greece\u2019s third since May 2010 - with a \u20ac1.6bn credit line if euro area creditors agreed to far-reaching debt relief for Athens. Talks on the issue, conducted on the sidelines of this weekend\u2019s G7 meeting in Canada, failed to make progress with both the EU and IMF agreeing to return to negotiations later this week in Paris. Speaking to Greece\u2019s state-run news agency late on Sunday, the Fund\u2019s Greek representative Michalis Psalidopoulos said since the organisation \u201cprobably does not have enough time to activate its program\u201d it would continue to contribute only in its capacity as technical advisor. But Mario Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers said the EU is still determined to reach a debt relief deal for Greece by the June 21 euro group \u2013 giving it enough time to keep to its planned bailout exit on August 20. IMF participation is crucial if the deal is to be credible to markets, he told Reuters at the weekend. Talks in Paris on Thursday are likely to explore several options including prolonging maturities on loans from Greece\u2019s second bailout program. Separately, Greece has taken another step towards normality by relaxing some of the capital controls introduced three years ago: Good news: The sale of Aunt Bessie\u2019s to Nomad Foods shouldn\u2019t lead to job cuts at its production operation in Hull. Wayne Hudson, MD of Birds Eye UK, has suggested the 400 jobs at the site should be safe. He told the Hull Daily Mail that: We have no plans whatsoever to close the factory in Hull. We will be working with the team there to understand how we can continue the great job they have done. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe and Asia\u2019s lead when it opens in two hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to gain 140 points, or over 0.5%. Wall Street is still taking comfort from last Friday\u2019s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which suggests the US economy is in good shape. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: The jobs report on Friday was yet another reminder of how well the US economy is doing and why the Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy despite constantly being questioned about the need to do so when inflation is only accelerating at a moderate pace. Strong job gains combined with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8% and a slight uptick in wage growth was welcome at a time when people are generally fretting about the threat posed by an unnecessary trade war. It\u2019s a little surprising that investors aren\u2019t more concerned about the hoofing delivered to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at last weekend\u2019s G7 finance minister meeting. This tweet-thread, from Bloomberg\u2019s Mike McKee, explains just how badly relations between America and the rest have deteriorated: William Jackson Food Group chairman Nicholas Oughtred says Aunt Bessie\u2019s could have a great long-term future under its new owners: \u201cAunt Bessie\u2019s has come a long way with us. We\u2019ve invested heavily in developing the business and the brand, and Nomad Foods is well placed to take the business even further. Nomad Foods is a well-known food group with a strong commitment to the frozen category, incredible experience, scale and investment capabilities and I\u2019m sure Aunt Bessie\u2019s will continue to thrive. \u201cWe are exceptionally proud of everyone who works at Aunt Bessie\u2019s and are grateful to them for helping it become the much-loved household name that it is today.\u201d Newsflash: Where there\u2019s puds, there\u2019s brass! Aunt Bessie\u2019s, maker of frozen Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes has just been sold to Nomad Foods, for the princely sum of \u20ac240m (\u00a3210m). Nomad already owns Birds Eye, Findus, Iglo and Goodfella\u2019s, so this deal helps to tighten its grip on Britain\u2019s frozen foods aisles. In a statement just released, Nomad say that acquiring Aunt Bessie\u2019s will expand their portfolio into the \u201cmajor eating occasion\u201d of roast dinners. Stefan Descheemaeker, Nomad Foods\u2019 Chief Executive Officer explains: Aunt Bessie\u2019s significantly expands our presence within potatoes, one of the largest categories in frozen food, while adding another dimension to our growing portfolio in the United Kingdom.\u201d Aunt Bessie\u2019s is being sold by William Jackson &amp; Son Limited (which also owns veg box supplier Abel &amp; Cole). Back in 2015, CEO Norman Soutar explained that the company appealed to cooks who fear getting their roast puds and spuds wrong [one trick is to get the oil really hot....] Britain\u2019s stock market continues to shrug off the trade war anxiety. The FTSE 100 is now up 61 points, or 0.8%, at 7762 - a one-week high. United Utilities, Severn Trent and easyJet are all topping the risers, after City analysts raised their price targets for their respective shares. UK cardboard box maker DS Smith is also in demand. Its shares are up 3% after announcing a \u00a31.7bn takeover of Spanish packaging rival Europac. Back in the markets, Italian government is recovering in value this morning - pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows that fears that Italy might quit the euro are fading, after its new populist government was sworn in last week. But... the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement is surely heading for clashes with Brussels over their spending and migration plans. Last weekend, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said he hoped to introduce a universal basic income for poorer Italians while League\u2019s leader Matteo Salvini vowed to cut spending on asylum seekers and deport migrants. The sharp decline in eurozone investor confidence may be a sign that Europe\u2019s economy is faltering. Here\u2019s some snap reaction from economists: Investor optimism across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, thanks to trade war fears and the Italian political crisis. That\u2019s according to Sentix, the German research group. Sentix\u2019s index of eurozone investor morale has tumbled to just 9.3 this month, down from 19.2 in May. That\u2019s much worse than expected, and extends the index\u2019s recent losses. Investors told Sentix they are less optimistic about future prospects, and that current conditions have deteriorated. Last month\u2019s chaos in Italy over its new government helped to drag down economic prospects in the eurozone, says Manfred H\u00fcbner, managing director at Sentix. He added: \u201cThe new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors.\u201d H\u00fcbner added that investors are also concerned about America\u2019s \u201cpunitive tariffs\u201d, while still hoping that a full-blown trade war can be avoided. Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club is disappointed that Britain\u2019s construction PMI was unchanged at 52.5 last month. He says it\u2019s a sign that building firms are struggling to gain any momentum: Fuelling concerns about the construction sector\u2019s difficulties in building momentum, new orders contracted anew in May, confidence was at a 7-month low and employment growth slowed. This suggests that a marked upturn in construction activity is likely to remain conspicuous by its absence The construction sector\u2019s difficulties in recent months has clearly been influenced by economic and Brexit uncertainties fuelling clients\u2019 caution over committing to new projects. Lacklustre economic activity in some sectors of the economy (such as retail) has also weighed down on construction, as has a shortage on new infrastructure projects. It is also evident that construction sector has suffered from some fall-out from the collapse of Carillion early in the year. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s builders are suffering from political uncertainty, which has helped to undermine new business opportunities. The monthly survey of UK construction, from data firm Markit, shows that new order books shrank in May, for the fourth time in five months. Optimism about growth prospects also shrank, to a seven-month low, with bosses blaming fears of political and economic uncertainty. This dragged back growth in housebuilding and civil engineering last month, although commercial construction accelerated. This left Markit\u2019s construction PMI, which measures activity, unchanged at 52.5 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit, says UK building firms are making an \u2018underwhelming\u2019 recovery from the snow-related disruption last winter. \u201cInflows of new business slipped back into decline, signalling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter. Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May. \u201cWith new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it\u2019s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook.\u201d Donald Trump loves tweeting about rising stock markets, so he\u2019ll be delighted that trade war fears haven\u2019t sparked a wave of sell orders. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, reckons today\u2019s mild market reaction will encourage Trump to stick to his guns.... but the rally could end in tears: The two main benchmarks President Trump appears to use to gauge the success of his policies are his grassroot supporters and the US equity market. His blue-collar followers are hugely supportive of tariffs, and with equity markets currently also choosing to dismiss the problem and in positive territory, this is reinforcing President Trump\u2019s view that he is doing the right thing, making it less likely that he will back away from his current stance. This chicken and egg position, where markets don\u2019t believe that tariffs are a credible threat, combined with President Trump\u2019s position that markets are not worried about the issue could lead to an unpleasant reality for both sides eventually. However, for the moment investors are benefitting from positive sentiment. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, could have a showdown with Donald Trump over trade at this week\u2019s G7 summit, according to French officials. Reuters has the details: The work agenda for the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada this week has been complicated by the United State\u2019s stance on trade, climate change and foreign policy, a source at the French president\u2019s office said on Monday. \u201cThe U.S. position on certain issues could make negotiations on the final conclusion (of the summit) tricky,\u201d the source said, citing foreign policy moves such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The source said President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump could hold talks on the sidelines of the summit. The latest trade war tensions have had \u2018remarkably little\u2019 impact on the markets, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: Carrying over last Friday\u2019s robust relief rally, investors continued to ignore the trade tensions sprouting out of the US in favour of celebrating the improved political situation in the Eurozone. A feisty G7 meeting over the weekend, with US Treasury secretary having to fend-off his furious European and Canadian peers as they vented about last week\u2019s tariff announcement from Trump, and news that the US and China made no progress in their latest negotiations, had remarkably little impact on Monday\u2019s trading. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says there are plenty of events that could spook the markets this week. The list includes this week\u2019s G7 leaders meeting, central bank meetings in Turkey and Australia, a confidence vote for Italy\u2019s new populist government, and further trade war developments. But, the strength of Friday\u2019s US jobs data may set the tone for the start of the week, he adds. Europe\u2019s biggest stock markets have all opened higher, as traders take their cue from last Friday\u2019s strong US jobs report: European stock markets are rallying, despite the double-dose of trade war worries. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 37 points (or 0.5%) in early trading to 7740. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe\u2019s largest companies, is also 0.5% higher. Two banks, France\u2019s Societe Generale and Italy\u2019s Unicredit, are leading the rally following reports they are considering a merger. In another worrying development, talks between America and China over trade have ended without a breakthrough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Liu He, China\u2019s economic czar, led the weekend negotiations in Beijing over the weekend. The talks centred on China\u2019s promise to buy more American agricultural and energy products, to help lower the US trade deficit. Negotiators have hit a sticking point - Beijing won\u2019t sign up to buy more US goods until the Trump administration have promised not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports. The US, though, want China to make the first move. This has raised the danger that talks collapse, and that both sides impose tariffs on $50bn of each other\u2019s exports. The New York Times says: \u201cIf the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,\u201d China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media. The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China\u2019s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. France\u2019s finance and economy minister was particularly scathing about America\u2019s new tariffs on certain imports, including steel and aluminium from Europe. Bruno Le Maire revealed that last weekend\u2019s G7 finance ministers meeting was much chillier than usual, saying: \u201cIt has been a tense and tough G7 - I would say it\u2019s been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. \u201cWe regret that our common work together at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a global trade war are looming over the financial markets as investors return to their desks for the new week. Over the weekend, the world\u2019s top finance ministers lined up to criticise America\u2019s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, at a G7 meeting in Canada. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin faced a barrage of attacks, with fellow ministers warning that \u201ccollaboration and cooperation\u201d between the G7 was now at risk. The official statement following the meeting is remarkably blunt, stating that: Concerns were expressed that the tariffs imposed by the United States on its friends and allies, on the grounds of national security, undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the United States Secretary of the Treasury communicate their unanimous concern and disappointment. Attendees had a \u201cfrank exchange\u201d on the benefits of an open rules-based trading system -- which is a diplomatic way of saying there were verbal fisticuffs. The statement concluded by saying that \u201cmost\u201d G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors regret the uncertainty created by America\u2019s trade actions, which threatens global co-operation. The international community is faced with significant economic and security issues, which are best addressed through a united front from G7 countries. Members continue to make progress on behalf of our citizens, but recognize that this collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by trade actions against other members. The issue is certain to dominate the upcoming meeting of G7 leaders later this week. The markets, though, are holding their nerve. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei gaining almost 1.4% - its best day in six weeks. European markets are also expected to rally, following last Friday\u2019s strong US employment data - which showed a pick-up in wage growth and job creation. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says this has cheered investors: Wall Street ended the previous week on a positive footing, lifted by a better than expected US jobs report; 223k jobs created in May vs. expectations of 200k, unemployment unexpectedly fell to an 18 year low of 3.8% and wages managed to creep up to 2.7%, better than the 2.6% forecast and a 4-month high. The solid jobs report overshadowed any trade war concerns which had been brewing and lifted the S&amp;P over 1%. Coming up today, we get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s construction sector - which suffered a fall in output earlier this year, plus US factory orders and eurozone construction data.

Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. </p> <p>We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at \u00a33.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of \u00a31.1 billion, or \u00a31.9 billion if you include the cost of financing.</p> <p>RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today\u2019s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote> <p>Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring.</p> <p>The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cmegaphone\u201d diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors\u2019 enthusiasm for equities.</p> <p>The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don\u2019t think that Italy\u2019s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again.</p> <p>The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy.</p> <p>The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b154975e4b00330690639d0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-04T14:19:37.815Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Weak US factory orders in April</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery.</p> <p>Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%.

      "bodyText": "How bad is the situation? Two of Britain\u2019s biggest franchises, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and Northern, have seen hundreds of trains cancelled daily, with many more severely delayed, disrupting the lives of hundreds of thousands of passengers who rely on their services. Since a new timetable was introduced two weeks ago, daily performance measures have shown Northern running as few as 57% of trains on time, while GTR has on several days run little more than seven-in-10 to schedule. But even those dismal statistics conceal local pockets of disaster, where trains have been disrupted to an even greater degree: at times, far more have been cancelled or severely delayed, such as the Thameslink mainline to Brighton or routes in Lancashire and Cumbria. The introduction of an emergency timetable, with reduced trains, on Monday, has reduced but by no means ended late-notice cancellations and delays. Why was a new timetable introduced? The laudable aim was \u2013 and remains \u2013 to create more capacity, to make better use of new trains, and to make the most of upgraded rail infrastructure, including the Ordsall Chord track allowing new services to travel through Manchester and the rebuilt core of London, theoretically allowing dozens of automated Thameslink trains to pass every hour. While minor changes are made every year, on this occasion much of the timetable \u2013 including every train time on GTR \u2013 was completely redrawn. This was a key step in the industry plan to add 6,400 extra services a week and 7,000 new carriages by 2021, according to the Rail Delivery Group. And what has gone wrong? Train companies lack drivers qualified to run the new services. Each driver must be trained for the model of train and full route they operate \u2013 and not enough are. Training up more drivers for new routes means taking more drivers out of action, compounding the shortage for existing services. Surely they saw this coming? Yes and no. At GTR, some of the additional services were deliberately being phased in over the next 18 months in a vain attempt to avoid some of the scenes being played out now. Even so, complications arose, including negotiations over rest day working restricting time available for retraining at Northern. Meanwhile, overrunning engineering works \u2013 most significantly, the electrification of the Manchester-Bolton-Preston line, as well as work on the Midland mainline \u2013 meant the timetable had to be overwritten. Network Rail\u2019s planners were unable to confirm routes and times until a matter of weeks before the revamp, rather than the normal three to six months for a routine change. Who is to blame? Take your pick: unions say train operators were warned a year ago that they needed to start retraining drivers urgently. Chris Grayling blames Network Rail for unacceptable delays in its works. Network Rail says there is \u201cno doubt that the May timetable was finalised significantly later than normal\u201d, but \u201cfor reasons that were both within and without our control\u201d. Train operators certainly can point the finger at Network Rail, but the recent record of GTR and Northern has hardly convinced commuters of their competence. The sheer scale of change may have stretched resources in planning departments around the industry. A key question MPs are asking is why the timetable changes weren\u2019t deferred once the odds had become clear. While the public industry position is collective remorse, many appeared aware that things might go horribly wrong \u2013 and there are rumblings that the DfT insisted on the impossible rather than allowing a delay. When will they fix it? No one wants to put a time on how long it will take. But the interim timetables on Northern and GTR should stem the worst of cancellations. The outright withdrawal of services to the Lakes is due to last a fortnight, while elsewhere it may take at least the summer to bring enough drivers through and iron out the worst disruption. Sir Peter Hendy, chair of Network Rail, said: \u201cThe only way of putting things right is for everyone to work collaboratively. Changes to stabilise services and offer better predictability for passengers are starting now, with more to come in the coming days. It will take time, but the whole railway is working flat-out and these issues will be fixed.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost \u00a32.6bn to City investors at a loss. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns the RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank\u2019s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state\u2019s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when Hammond\u2019s predecessor George Osborne was forced to defend the sale of a first tranche at a loss of about \u00a31bn. Analysts said the government would need to sell the shares for slightly less than the 280.9p closing price on the London Stock Exchange on Monday in order to entice City investors to buy. The Treasury said it would announce the sale price on Tuesday morning. However, at just below the current share price, the latest sale will net less than the last disposal under Osborne, when the government offered shares to investors for 330p. Labour criticised the latest share sale, with the disposal coming well below the 500p per share paid by the government to save RBS at the height of the financial crisis, costing taxpayers more than \u00a340bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThere is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.\u201d The view at the Treasury has increasingly become that RBS shares are a yoke that needs to be removed as quickly as possible, with potential to use the funds to help cut the government\u2019s budget deficit. Officials are of the view the price paid for the shares is an irrelevance because they were bought to save RBS from collapse and not as an investment. City analysts also said there was little chance of the government recovering all of its money from RBS for at least several years. Sam Dumitriu of the free market Adam Smith Institute said it was a mistake for Labour to think that because RBS was once worth twice as much it would ever be worth that again. \u201cChasing your losses is not a sound investment strategy, it\u2019s problem gambling,\u201d he said. The latest disposal could help Hammond lay the ground for raising public spending at the budget later this year. The chancellor earmarked RBS share sales worth \u00a33bn for each financial year until 2023 at the autumn budget, helping to keep the government\u2019s budget deficit shrinking over the course of the current parliament. However, the sale is likely to raise eyebrows because it comes after RBS\u2019s outgoing chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said now was not the right time to sell shares in the bank. Political turmoil in Italy and the threat of a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump have rattled financial markets in recent weeks, making it a riskier time to sell shares. Even so, shares in RBS have rebounded in recent months, with the bank having reached a $4.9bn (\u00a33.6bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge.\u201d",

The Treasury said it would announce the sale price on Tuesday morning. </p> <p>However, at just below the current share price, the latest sale will net less than the last disposal under Osborne, when the government offered shares to investors for 330p. </p> <p>Labour criticised the latest share sale, with the disposal coming well below the 500p per share paid by the government to save RBS at the height of the financial crisis, costing taxpayers more than \u00a340bn. </p> <p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThere is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.\u201d</p> <p>The view at the Treasury has increasingly become that RBS shares are a yoke that needs to be removed as quickly as possible, with potential to use the funds to help cut the government\u2019s budget deficit. Officials are of the view the price paid for the shares is an irrelevance because they were bought to save RBS from collapse and not as an investment. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/29/rbs-cuts-lending-to-new-coal-and-arctic-oil-projects\">RBS cuts lending to new coal and Arctic oil projects</a> </p> </aside>  <p>City analysts also said there was little chance of the government recovering all of its money from RBS for at least several years. Sam Dumitriu of the free market Adam Smith Institute said it was a mistake for Labour to think that because RBS was once worth twice as much it would ever be worth that again. </p> <p>\u201cChasing your losses is not a sound investment strategy, it\u2019s problem gambling,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The latest disposal could help Hammond lay the ground for raising public spending at the budget later this year. The chancellor earmarked RBS share sales worth \u00a33bn for each financial year until 2023 at the autumn budget, helping to keep the government\u2019s budget deficit shrinking over the course of the current parliament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the sale is likely to raise eyebrows because it comes after RBS\u2019s outgoing chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/30/rbs-cautions-against-a-restart-of-sale-of-taxpayers-stake\">said now was not the right time to sell shares in the bank</a>.

Nomad Foods, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is buying Aunt Bessie\u2019s from William Jackson Food Group, a 167-year-old family firm based in Yorkshire. The deal includes a factory in Hull and will bring together Aunt Bessie\u2019s \u2013 the UK\u2019s number one brand for frozen Yorkshire puddings \u2013 with Nomad\u2019s other investments, which include Findus, Birds Eye and Goodfellas Pizzas. Aunt Bessie\u2019s \u2013 which last year made \u00a320m profit from revenues of \u00a3108m \u2013 employs 400 people, all based in Hull. Nomad said all staff would transfer to Birds Eye when the deal is completed in the autumn, taking the group\u2019s total workforce to 1,600.

      "bodyText": "The chairman of BT is holding a series of meetings with top investors ahead of its annual meeting next month amid reports of increasing dissatisfaction with the performance of the chief executive, Gavin Patterson. Last month, Patterson unveiled his new strategy for the company, which includes axing 13,000 jobs, as the telecoms group struggles with increased competition and falling revenues. Patterson is investing in building up its mobile and TV services to complement its broadband and fixed line business. But he has been criticised for spending billions of pounds on sports rights in an attempt to attract customers to its TV service, as well as the company\u2019s difficult relationship with regulator Ofcom. Days after the news of the job cuts, the company revealed Patterson was paid \u00a32.3m last year, including a \u00a31.3m bonus and a 1.5% rise in his basic salary. The company, still reeling from a disastrous 18 months that included an accounting scandal in Italy and a record \u00a342m fine from Ofcom, has seen its share price slump to a six-year low. The BT chairman, Jan du Plessis, has publicly endorsed Patterson and his strategy. Last month, he said: \u201cYou do not build great businesses by being fussed about tomorrow morning\u2019s share price. \u201cThis is a great company, but we\u2019ve got problems and challenges, and we\u2019re going to address them by focusing on the right places, by investing in networks, by investing in converged connectivity, and by reshaping the organisation the way that Gavin announced.\u201d Representatives of a number of major shareholders have told the Financial Times they are not happy with the chief executive and said they planned to call for further meetings with the company. One said Patterson was not the right man for the job, while others said he was being given his last chance and his strategy seemed to \u201cchop and change\u201d. But a company source said Du Plessis wrote to shareholders after last month\u2019s strategy update offering follow-up meetings. He has already met a number of them, with another half dozen planned ahead of July\u2019s AGM. Fund manager Thomas Moore of Aberdeen Standard defended Patterson. Speaking on BBC radio\u2019s Today programme, he said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a tough set of cards he\u2019s been dealt. When you consider the sort of pressures they\u2019ve been under, they would have been there whoever the chief executive would have been. \u201cSome of them are self-inflicted, like the accounting scandal in Italy, but you\u2019ve got to consider there\u2019s a lot of regulatory pressure on BT to cut tariffs, pressure to improve customer service and pressure on them to contribute to their pension fund and all of that has put a lot of pressure on Gavin Patterson and the dividend is also coming under some pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy situation, he\u2019s dealing with it with this convergence strategy, investing in mobile and TV alongside broadband and fixed line.\u201d",

Monsanto will no longer be a company name,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe acquired products will retain their brand names and become part of the Bayer portfolio.\u201d Monsanto has long been targeted by environmental activists for its pioneering role in creating GM crops and the deadly herbicide Agent Orange, used by the US in the Vietnam war. The company, which was founded in St Louis, Missouri, in 1901, has been described as an \u201cexample of American corporate evil\u201d. Bayer\u2019s chairman, Werner Baumann, promised the company would engage with campaigners, who have described the takeover as a \u201cmarriage made in hell\u201d. \u201cWe aim to deepen our dialogue with society.

      "bodyText": "High street store closures are adding to the mounting problems facing Britain\u2019s construction industry, despite a modest uplift from good weather over the past month. While the industry continued to stage a modest recovery in May after bad weather earlier this year, reduced demand from struggling retailers was one reason cited by the latest IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers survey for the fourth decline in new orders in five months. Some builders suggested unusually good weather over the past month helped boost activity levels, along with catching up from weaker business triggered by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d in late February and early March. The reading on the IHS Markit/CIPS construction PMI remained steady at 52.5 points in May, against economists\u2019 forecasts for a slight decline in activity from the previous month. However, Sam Teague, an economist at IHS Markit, cautioned that a renewed drop in new work \u201chinted that the recovery could prove short-lived\u201d. According to the latest health check, house building remains the strongest area for the construction industry, while demand for commercial and civil engineering projects remains muted amid political uncertainty. Having come under pressure from a slowdown in consumer spending triggered by weak wage growth and high levels of inflation caused by the Brexit vote, retailers are cutting their demand for new shops, which is having a knock-on effect for building firms. Several major retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer have closed stores this year in an effort to maintain profits. Job creation among builders fell to a four-month low in May, while companies also continued to report skills shortages. Purchasing costs for construction firms rose sharply, particularly for fuel amid the rising cost of petrol across the UK, as well as for materials made from plastic and steel. Phil Harris, a director at BLP Insurance, said: \u201cOffice space demand in London is declining, retailers continue to hit the headlines with store closures, and while hotels and leisure are proving resilient, overall the sector is not booming.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks has improved its \u00a31.6bn offer for Virgin Money in an attempt to create Britain\u2019s sixth-largest bank, with 6 million customers. Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG) is offering Virgin shareholders a larger stake in the combined group \u2013 38% compared with 36.5% under the initial offer \u2013 prompting Virgin to enter into negotiations with its rival. CYBG is offering to exchange 1.2125 new shares for each Virgin Money share, up from 1.1297 shares. The revised offer values Virgin Money at 359p a share. CYBG\u2019s share price had fallen in recent weeks but rose 1.4% to 296.4p on Monday morning. Virgin Money said it had begun talks with CYBG because of the improvement in the terms of the proposal, and the \u201csubstantial synergy potential\u201d and growth opportunities. The boards of both banks said the proposed deal would create the UK\u2019s first true national competitor to the five large banks, with 6 million personal and business customers. They believe it would bring significant savings by removing overlap between the two companies, optimising IT spending and \u201crationalising\u201d their operations. Virgin Money\u2019s founder, Richard Branson, who owns a 35% stake, could make a large profit on such a sale, seven years after he led a controversial \u00a3747m buyout of Northern Rock \u2013 later rebranded Virgin \u2013 following its rescue by the taxpayer. The price paid by a consortium of investors, led by Branson, was half the amount the UK taxpayer had injected into the bank. The Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood said he thought the offer was \u201csomewhat lightweight\u201d, adding that it should be thought of as a merger rather than a takeover. Given that the two boards were in discussions, Greenwood said there was \u201cgoodwill on both sides of the fence for a deal to proceed\u201d and he expected the offer to be formalised before the new deadline of 18 June. \u201cWhether Virgin Money \u2013 and its shareholders \u2013 will press for a further sweetener remains to be seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lack of an upfront cash incentive is notable and may be a source of further debate.\u201d The deal would bring together CYBG, which has 169 branches, mostly in Scotland and Yorkshire, and serves 2.8 million commercial and personal customers, with Virgin Money\u2019s brand strong in the mortgages and credit cards business, which has 3.3 million customers. Virgin Money was founded in 1995 as an investment business, then known as Virgin Direct, but only became a larger operation with the takeover of Northern Rock in 2011.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has shrunk in the past decade by almost 600,000 jobs to leave fewer than 3 million workers employed in the sector. A study by the GMB union found that every region in the UK has suffered a decline in manufacturing employment over 10 years, with London, Scotland and the north-west the worst affected. In 2007, the UK supported 3.5m permanent and temporary manufacturing jobs \u2013 more than 12% of the all British employment \u2013 but by 2016 that had slumped to 2.9m , or 9.2% of the total, the union said. Jude Brimble, GMB national officer, said: \u201cWe are at a critical crossroads in UK manufacturing. \u201cThe right support for our manufacturing sector would accelerate growth, address the skills gap and provide much provide a much-needed boost to technology, production and exports. \u201cA robust manufacturing base post-Brexit is vital for the UK economy, workers and local communities.\u201d The UK\u2019s largest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has yet to make a commitment to building its next-generation electric cars in the UK after it demanded the government agree to fund \u00a3450m of infrastructure in the West Midlands before it made a decision. In April the company, owned by India\u2019s Tata Group, said it would cut more than 1,000 jobs, blaming a slump in car sales due to uncertainty about Brexit and the future of diesel vehicles. In 2016, Tata made more than 1,000 workers redundant across its steel plants in Port Talbot and Llanwern in south Wales and in Trostre, Corby and Hartlepool. Last week, it urged the government and the European Union to fight sanctions imposed by Donald Trump\u2019s Republican administration, which it said would harm steel exports. The EEF, which represents manufacturers, said the continued political uncertainty over Brexit negotiations had dragged down business investment to the lowest level for a year. A poll of more than 300 manufacturers found they remained generally positive, with business confidence holding up looking forward to the second half of the year. \u201cHowever, the durability of this upturn is looking somewhat more fragile as many of the positive forces driving expansion last year such as a resurgent eurozone, a surge in global manufacturing investment and competitive pound are starting to fade,\u201d said the organisation\u2019s chief economist, Lee Hopley. \u201cNew or heightened uncertainties have come into play, not least what feels like crunch time in the Brexit negotiations which have led to amber lights flashing again on the business investment outlook.\u201d The manufacturing sector has failed to regain the level of output seen before the financial crash in 2008. In the recession that followed, hundreds of companies went bust or moved production overseas. Low oil prices and slump in the value of sterling helped manufacturers to increase exports during 2016 and 2017, but firms recorded weaker growth in the first quarter of the year as the stuttering Brexit talks increased uncertainty and a rise oil prices coupled with a higher pound increased import costs. Tom Lawton, of the business advisory firm BDO, which helped with the research, said companies were still cautiously optimistic, but \u201cwe are starting to see the impacts of the ongoing political and economic uncertainty on the UK manufacturing sector\u201d. The GMB said London, Scotland and the north-west lost 27%, 22% and 21% of their manufacturing jobs respectively. The worst-affected region by total losses \u2013 the north-west \u2013 lost 93,500 jobs.",

      "bodyText": "Railway passengers could choose to pay more to travel on \u201creliable and comfortable trains\u201d under a radical shake-up of rail ticketing being planned by the industry. Combining peak and off-peak fares into a new \u201cflat fare\u201d structure so passengers are charged the same during busier and quieter periods, and reducing prices for e-tickets but charging more for paper tickets, are options outlined in a consultation being launched on Monday. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, is seeking passengers\u2019 views in the biggest ever consultation into rail fares. It is being launched with passenger watchdog Transport Focus, and responses will lead to recommendations for the government to consider in the autumn. The group said it was cancelling its annual conference due to start on Monday because of the ongoing delays and cancellations to services but the consultation would go ahead. Last month, rail companies announced that they were seeking \u201croot and branch\u201d reform of fare regulations that date back to the mid-1990s and had failed to reflect the march of technology and changing working patterns. With 55m different fares in the current system \u2013 according to the providers\u2019 body, the Rail Delivery Group \u2013 the industry wants to persuade ministers to simplify ticketing and make it easier to use, ending anomalies such as split-ticketing, whereby it is cheaper to buy several tickets for a journey than a single one. Following recent disruption on some parts of the network due to botched timetable changes, passengers will be asked whether fares should be based on quality of service. They could opt to travel more cheaply on routes with slower, less regular and more basic trains, with better services becoming more expensive. Abolishing railcards could also be considered, along with rewarding regular travellers for their loyalty. Passengers will be asked whether they prefer certainty over the price of journeys, even if it means early-bird or last-minute deals are restricted. The industry has pledged that average fares will not rise as a result of any reform. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, said the industry\u2019s priority was to create an easier-to-use fares system. \u201cReforming the rules about how tickets are sold and bought has the potential to transform the buying experience for customers, making it easier for people to be confident they are getting the right ticket,\u201d he said. \u201cThese reforms support what the industry is already doing to make improvements to fares alongside record investment in new train carriages, upgraded stations and extra services.\u201d Its latest research found that 34% of passengers were \u201cvery confident\u201d they bought the best-value ticket for their last journey, and just 29% were \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with the ticket-buying experience. The three-month consultation will be hosted on britainrunsonrail.co.uk and involve a questionnaire that can be completed online or posted via freepost. Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus, said: \u201cOur research shows that rail passengers want a fares system that is simple to use, easy to understand and is flexible enough to cater to how people work and travel today. ... We will ensure the voice of the passenger is heard clearly as part of this consultation.\u201d The consumer group Which? welcomed the consultation but called for automatic compensation to be introduced as standard. \u201cIt\u2019s been clear for years that rail fares are too complicated and confusing for passengers, and all too often people don\u2019t get the best fare for their journey\u201d said Alex Hayman, Which? managing director of public markets. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation that\u2019s gone on too long and the government needs to make sure that any changes to the fares system are in the best interests of passengers. \u201cTrust in the industry is chronically low. While fixing the broken fares system will go some way to address this, more must be done for passengers who have to deal with shambolic services day in, day out.
