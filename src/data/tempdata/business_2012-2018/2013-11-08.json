    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group has warned that the financial fallout from its troubled banking division could have an impact on its wider business, particularly its supermarket chain. In the hundreds of pages of documents published to give details of the \u00a31.5bn rescue of the bank, which is being forced to give up its mutual ownership under pressure from two US hedge funds, the group outlined the importance of the dividend it pays out to its seven million members before Christmas on its supermarket operations. The dividend is a particularly sensitive topic as the group \u2013 which also runs funeral homes, pharmacies and farms \u2013 plunged to a \u00a3559m loss for the first six months of the year because of \u00a3700m losses at the bank. Its website states that its pays dividends out of profits \u2013 suggesting it will have difficulty making any payment this year. In the prospectus being sent to bondholders who are being asked to prop up the bank, the Co-op group said: \"Over the last few years, the issuer [ie the group] has declared a dividend to its members in the run-up to Christmas\". \"Historically, food sales have benefited from this dividend, which is paid in the form of vouchers. If in the future the timing or size of the dividend changes, or no dividend is declared, there is a risk that this will have a negative impact on food sales, which in turn could adversely affect the group's business, results of operations and financial performance,\" the group warned. The group has embarked on an offensive to persuade holders of its bonds \u2013 big City investors, hedge funds as well as 15,000 retail investors \u2013 to back a \u00a31.5bn rescue deal under which it will end up owning only 30% of the bank. The group is to put in \u00a3462m and bondholders \u00a31bn as well as take 70% stake in the bank. With the members gathering for the half-yearly meeting in Manchester on Saturday, the situation at the bank and the prospects for a dividend are expected to be the topic of discussion. The dividend was recently reinstated as part of a plan to rejuvenate the co-operative movement. But a year ago the group was already running into trouble with its members after halving the size of the dividend, which is paid out based on the number of points each member accrues through shopping across the range of Co-op businesses. In June, when the plight of its bank had become apparent and when new management had been installed, it still said it would pay out \u00a364m. A typical payout of \u00a326 would be based on spending \u00a310 a week in a store over a year, \u00a31,000 on a holiday, a mortgage and buying a television in its electrical division. Len Wardle, the chairman of Co-op, has already announced that he intends to resign at next year's annual meeting and use Saturday's meeting to try to persuade the group to appoint his successor from outside the membership in an attempt to counter criticism about the running of the 150-year-old institution, with roots in the co-operative movement in Rochdale, above. Following the announcement of details of its rescue this week the bank wrote to nearly 130 local authorities explaining that it would no longer provide their banking services. It had already said it would run down non-core parts of its business, including loans to housing associations and stop lending to all new corporate customers.",

      "bodyText": "Stuart Gulliver, the boss of HSBC, has spoken out against the lack of women at the top of what he called the \"pale, male, stale\" banking industry. In a speech in Hong Kong, Gulliver said: \"To discriminate against women is to discriminate against talent. It's unfair. It's wrong. And it's a really poor business decision.\" He explained: \"This is not about being cuddly, it's about competitive advantage.\" Almost half of the bank's 261,000 workforce is made up of women but at senior management level the proportion falls below a quarter. However, this is a higher proportion than rivals and Gulliver said the bank had set a target for 25% of senior management to be women compared with 22% now. The bank has four women \u2013 all non-executives \u2013 on its board of seventeen. \"That shouldn't be taken as a signal that the job is done \u2013 because having four women on a board of seventeen people doesn't necessarily tell you very much about the experiences of the 125,000 women in the rest of the organisation,\" Gulliver said. He said the bank had only in the last 10 to 20 years started to promote women in its workforce, assuming in the past that they would not want to work overseas or would fail to be taken seriously in some of the markets in which the bank operates. Describing himself as a grammar school boy who went to university (Oxford) on a scholarship, he said that diversity was not just about gender but also ethnicity, religious belief, disability and sexual orientation. He said Antonio Simoes, chief executive of the UK banking arm, had been ranked number one on the \"OUTstanding in Business\" power list of gay and lesbian business leaders in Britain. \"The real opportunity on diversity is to be more thoughtful,\" said Gulliver. The 54-year-old, who began his career at HSBC as a foreign exchange trader, said that he was trying to change the culture of the bank. When he joined it was a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week commitment \u2013 \"a model that automatically made it tough for women who wanted to have children.

The most popular type of business is health and beauty, followed by food and drink, while manufacturing accounts for just 1.4% of businesses helped.

Start-Up Loans is definitely not here to create the next Google or the next Amazon. If it happens along the way, great, but we are very much focused on helping everyday businesspeople turn their entrepreneurial skills into a successful business.\" Britain has become more entrepreneurial in the last decade, she thinks, as the recession has dampened the labour market, while running a business has \"become a lot more sexy\" thanks to shows such as The Apprentice and Dragons' Den. But doesn't The Apprentice, with its backstabbing contestants and their Napoleonic egos, give people the wrong idea about how to make it in the business world? \"It is a TV show and [people] shouldn't take it too seriously,\" she says. \"In the same way, if you wanted to learn how to be a pop star, you wouldn't watch The X Factor and take notes. \"The very fact that the core of the show is about business is a positive thing because it starts a conversation.\" The teenagers who screamed at her in the streets after she won The Apprentice would never have watched a dry factual programme on how to be an entrepreneur, she says. Ultimately, \"people should not take everything on the TV as gospel\".",

    "webTitle": "Upbeat US jobs data raises prospect of December tapering", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Speculation that the Federal Reserve will begin winding down America's economic stimulus next month grew on Friday after the latest figures for jobs growth smashed expectations on Wall Street. News that the world's biggest economy shrugged off the impact of the three-week government shutdown to create 204,000 new jobs stunned dealers and prompted anticipation that the US central bank will start tapering away its $85bn (\u00a353bn) a month bond buying programme at its December meeting. Financial markets had been braced for an increase of 120,000 in October non-farm payrolls amid concerns that the budget stand-off in Washington would have a knock-on impact across the wider economy. But they revised forecasts that the Fed will wait until the spring before beginning the tapering process after the Bureau of Labour Statistics announced that an across-the-board increase in private sector jobs had swamped the effects of temporary layoffs of federal employees. The BLS also revised up its estimates of employment growth in the previous two months by a total of 60,000, with August payrolls increased from 193,000 to 238,000 and September's from 148,000 to 163,000. The Fed was widely expected to start winding down its quantitative easing programme in September but shelved the plans after growth prosepcts were damaged by an increase in long-term interest rates prompted by talk of a taper. But the BLS data for the labour market coupled with data showing that the US economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.8% in the third quarter of 2013 means that a small monthly cut in the amount of bonds being bought will be on the central bank's agenda when it meets next month. Shares on Wall Street rose in early trading, with some analysts saying that the Fed was still likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach given the probability that economic data during the period of the shutdown will be heavily revised. This feeling was strengthened by news that the regular snapshot of consumer confidence from Michigan University showed sentiment at its lowest level since late 2011. Paul Ashworth, US analyst for Capital Economics, said: \"The near three-week Federal government shutdown had little, if any, impact on payrolls. The strength in job creation was widespread. Manufacturing increased by a healthy 19,000, construction increased by 11,000 and retail increased by 44,000. Federal employment fell by a modest 12,000, because those workers affected by the shutdown received their back pay when they returned, which means they were counted as employed in the establishment survey. \"Overall, in our opinion, the data now justify the Fed reducing the pace of its asset purchases in December.\" But Chris Williamson, of Markit, said the US labour market was less healthy than the big jump in payrolls suggested, pointing out that the rise in unemployment from 7.2% to 7.3% of the workforce showed \"how the sluggish current pace of economic growth is failing to create enough new jobs to bring down the jobless total.\" He added: \"The employment data therefore adds to the sense that Fed policymakers will be in no rush to make any reduction to the current $85bn per month asset purchase programme, but that the risks are towards policy being reined in in due course. Most likely, however, the Fed will need to wait some time, possibly until after the health of the economy in the first quarter is ascertained, before making any firm decisions on any tapering. That could be as late as March.\" The Fed has been using a twin-tracked approach to boosting the US economy since it went into a deep recession in 2008. Official interest rates have been slashed to close to zero while quantitative easing has flooded the banking system with new electronic cash. But the recovery in the US economy and concerns that QE is leading to distortions in financial markets around the globe has resulted in some members of the Fed's policy making committee pressing for the programme to be wound down gradually. Wall Street believes that initially the bond-buying will only be reduced by $5-10bn a month, while the central bank has sought to reassure markets by stating that it currently has no plans to raise the cost of borrowing until unemployment comes down to 6.5%.",

    "webTitle": "Twitter dips after first day surge, while markets remain uncertain over Fed's plans", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In one of the most anticipated flotations of the year, Twitter shares flew sky high on their market debut last week before having their wings clipped. At Thursday's opening, investors scrambled to buy shares in the microblogging site, sending them soaring from the $26 offer price to more than $50. Twitter ended its first day as a public company with its shares at $44.90, a 73% rise which valued the business at more than $24bn. That equates to around $120 a user. The float instantly made billionaires of co-founders Ev Williams and Jack Dorsey, while private equity group Rizvi Traverse and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal were also in the money. The company successfully avoided the Facebook fiasco, where the social media group's shares fell sharply in the weeks after its public debut and took more than a year to return to their flotation price. It also outshone the UK's Royal Mail, which rose 8% on its first day of dealings last month and took a month to record a similar rise to Twitter's one day gain. Royal Mail closed at 569p on Friday, down 2.5p on the day and 72% higher than the 330p offer price. But as some analysts raised the spectre of another dotcom bubble, and said Twitter - which has yet to make a profit - was overvalued, its shares fell 4% to $43.09 in early trading on Friday. Overall, markets suffered another nervous week, with investors growing increasingly concerned that the US Federal Reserve might start to reduce its $85bn a month bond buying programme, which has been a key support for shares. This was prompted by stronger than expected US GDP growth on Thursday and much better than forecast non-farm payroll numbers yesterday - 204,000 jobs were created last month in comparison to predictions of a 120,000 increase. But a weak University of Michigan consumer confidence figure, which was issued shortly after the jobs data, threw everything back into the melting pot again. The surprise of the week was the European Central Bank cutting its key interest rate from 0.5% to 0.25%, a move which immediately put pressure on the euro. But strong UK data, including buoyant service sector figures, prompted suggestions that the Bank of England could move in the other direction and raise rates earlier than the market had been anticipating. So the FTSE 100 finished at 6708.42 on Friday, up 11.20 points on the day and but down 26 points on the week. British Airways and Iberian owner International Airlines Group led the day's FTSE 100 risers, up 27.9p to 376.9p after a recovery at the Spanish airline helped it more than double third quarter operating profits to \u20ac690m. Rolls-Royce rose 40p to \u00a312.10 as the aero engine maker said improvements in its defence and marine businesses would lead to better than expected growth in full year profits. Analyst Tina Cook at Charles Stanley said: In our opinion, recent share price underperformance offers an attractive entry point for investors. Rolls Royce remains well positioned with a diversified business model, global customer base, earnings visibility and potential for margin improvement. Elsewhere BAE Systems, which said on Wednesday it may cut 1,775 UK shipbuilding jobs, lost 3.2p to 457p. The idea of Vodafone being a possible target for US telecoms group AT&amp;T continued to gain ground, with two more brokers raising the prospect last week. At Berenberg, analyst Paul Marsch said: While rising political concerns over US eavesdropping may make European Commission approval of an AT&amp;T move more challenging, if AT&amp;T is serious about the European mobile opportunity, it is unlikely to be put off by such concerns....The prospect of 265p-275p per share remains enticing. Meanwhile Bernstein analysts raised their price target on Vodafone from 230p to 250p, factoring in a 75% chance of a deal with AT&amp;T. They said: Operationally and strategically, both AT&amp;T and Vodafone are experiencing a rough patch. The possible mega merger between the two that could be a welcome distraction for both appears to have the same momentum as the Verizon/Vodafone deal earlier this year. Vodafone added 0.95p to 228.75p on Friday. Aberdeen Asset Management dropped 20.2p to 422.2p on reports that Australia's Macquarie was preparing a \u00a3500m bid for Aberdeen target Scottish Widows, the fund management arm of Lloyds Banking Group, prompting concerns about a possible bidding war. On the high street there were contrasting updates last week from Marks &amp; Spencer, whose clothing ranges continued to struggle, and Associated British Foods' Primark chain, which reported a 22% rise in full year revenues to \u00a34.27bn and underlying profits up 44% to \u00a3514m. Marks slipped 8.5p to 500p on Friday while ABF added 8p to \u00a322.60. Finally, Finnish nickel miner Talvivaara Mining Company fell 11% to 6.2p on Friday after an 8% decline on Thursday, when it said it was in advanced rescue talks with the country's government but could face bankruptcy if the negotiations failed. It ran into financial difficulties after suffering production problems and weak nickel prices.",

But strong UK data, including buoyant service sector figures, prompted suggestions that the Bank of England could move in the other direction and raise rates earlier than the market had been anticipating.</p> <p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished at 6708.42 on Friday, up 11.20 points on the day and but down 26 points on the week.</p> <p>British Airways and Iberian owner <strong>International Airlines Group</strong> led the day's FTSE 100 risers, up 27.9p to 376.9p after a recovery at the Spanish airline helped it more than double third quarter operating profits to \u20ac690m.</p> <p><strong>Rolls-Royce</strong> rose 40p to \u00a312.10 as the aero engine maker said improvements in its defence and marine businesses would lead to better than expected growth in full year profits. Analyst Tina Cook at Charles Stanley said:</p> <blockquote> <p>In our opinion, recent share price underperformance offers an attractive entry point for investors. Rolls Royce remains well positioned with a diversified business model, global customer base, earnings visibility and potential for margin improvement.</p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>BAE Systems</strong>, which said on Wednesday it may cut 1,775 UK shipbuilding jobs, lost 3.2p to 457p.</p> <p>The idea of <strong>Vodafone</strong> being a possible target for US telecoms group AT&amp;T continued to gain ground, with two more brokers raising the prospect last week. At Berenberg, analyst Paul Marsch said:</p> <blockquote> <p>While rising political concerns over US eavesdropping may make European Commission approval of an AT&amp;T move more challenging, if AT&amp;T is serious about the European mobile opportunity, it is unlikely to be put off by such concerns....The prospect of 265p-275p per share remains enticing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Bernstein analysts raised their price target on Vodafone from 230p to 250p, factoring in a 75% chance of a deal with AT&amp;T. They said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Operationally and strategically, both AT&amp;T and Vodafone are experiencing a rough patch. The possible mega merger between the two that could be a welcome distraction for both appears to have the same momentum as the Verizon/Vodafone deal earlier this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Vodafone added 0.95p to 228.75p on Friday.</p> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Management</strong> dropped 20.2p to 422.2p on reports that Australia's Macquarie was preparing a \u00a3500m bid for Aberdeen target Scottish Widows, the fund management arm of Lloyds Banking Group, prompting concerns about a possible bidding war.</p> <p>On the high street there were contrasting updates last week from <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong>, whose clothing ranges continued to struggle, and <strong>Associated British Foods'</strong> Primark chain, which reported a 22% rise in full year revenues to \u00a34.27bn and underlying profits up 44% to \u00a3514m. Marks slipped 8.5p to 500p on Friday while ABF added 8p to \u00a322.60.</p> <p>Finally, Finnish nickel miner <strong>Talvivaara Mining Company</strong> fell 11% to 6.2p on Friday after an 8% decline on Thursday, when it said it was in advanced rescue talks with the country's government but could face bankruptcy if the negotiations failed. It ran into financial difficulties after suffering production problems and weak nickel prices.</p>",

His summary:</p> <blockquote> <p>The US created more than 200,000 fresh jobs in October as the world\u2019s biggest economy shrugged off the impact of the government shutdown.</p> <p>In news that immediately prompted speculation about a winding down of America\u2019s growth stimulus, the Bureau of Labour Statistics published figures showing a much better employment outlook than had been expected.</p> <p>Wall Street had been prepared for an increase of 120,000 in non-farm payrolls last month amid speculation that the temporary layoffs of federal employees would offset job creation in the private sector.</p> <p>The BLS also revised up its estimates of jobs growth in the previous two months \u2013 from 193,000 to 238,000 in August, and from 148,000 to 163,000 in September.</p> <p>Early indications were of a sharp sell off in US shares due to concerns that the increase in payrolls will bring forward the timing of the tapering away of the $85bn (\u00a353bn) a month stimulus provided by the Federal Reserve\u2019s bond buying programme.</p> <p>The US central bank deferred a decision on tapering in September, but is likely to discuss a scaling back of so-called quantitative easing when it meets next month.</p> <p>Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, said: \u201cThe data supports some views out there that the Fed will taper its quantative easing programme in December. However, the impact of the government shutdown in October reduces the reliability of the number, so we hold the view that the Fed will taper in March as opposed to December, once the Fed has seen more proof of improving labour market conditions.\u201d</p> <p>The BLS said almost half the increase in jobs came from two sectors \u2013 a 53,000 increase in the leisure and hospitality sector, and a 44,000 rise in retail employment. Despite the increase in payrolls, the unemployment rate edged up from 7.2% to 7.3%. The employment rate dropped by 0.4 percentage points to 62.8%.</p> <p>James Knightley, at ING bank, said: \u201cThe numbers are much stronger than anyone expected \u2013 the highest forecast in the market was 175,000 for payrolls \u2013 and suggest the government shutdown had a negligible impact on the labour market. However, this goes against anecdotal evidence suggesting that with government contracts not being paid, and the general level of economic uncertainty it created, this led to firms pulling back on hiring.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527cf009e4b0541f62c72cbf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-08T14:10:10.273Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">December taper?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at the Capital Economics thinktank </strong>says the strong US payrolls number for last month point to the US Federal Reservce starting to scale back its bond-buying stimulus programme in December.</p> <p>He has just sent through this analysis:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Together with the news yesterday of a stronger 2.8% gain in third-quarter GDP growth, the Fed now has the data to justify making its first reduction at December's FOMC meeting, but whether it will or not is still unclear.

But this time with the data providing fodder for those trying to guess when the Federal Reserve will start scaling back its stimulus programme - so-called tapering - guessing where a better, or worse, than expected number will send shares and bond yields is a tough one, says <strong>Matt Basi, Head of UK Sales Trading at CMC Markets:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Calls are for 120k jobs added, and to be honest I have no idea how the market would react in the event of a beat/miss.

Declining unemployment and improving business surveys suggest that the job creation seen in the first half of this year is continuing, which is a crucial element for a revival of domestic demand.</p> <p>Overall, however, Ireland is expected to record low growth in 2013. A somewhat higher growth rate, of about 1.75%, is projected for 2014 as its trading partners also begin to recover.</p> <p>The 2014 budget targets a primary balance and an overall deficit of 4.8% of GDP, which is more ambitious than the deficit ceiling of 5.1% of GDP set under the excessive deficit procedure. To reach these goals, Ireland\u2019s record of strong budget implementation needs to continue.

With total exports edging up just 0.1% month-on-month in September and falling by 2.2% overall in the third quarter, it is evident that the economy is currently far from seeing a hoped-for rebalancing with a greater contribution from exports.</p> <p>Meanwhile, construction output unexpectedly fell by 0.9% month-on-month in September. While not too much should be read into one month\u2019s performance given the well-known volatility in construction output and it followed a strong overall increase in August/July, it nevertheless meant that construction output expanded by 1.7% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter rather than by 2.5% quarter-on-quarter as had been estimated in the preliminary national accounts. In itself, this would mean that GDP growth in the third quarter would be shaved down by 0.05 percentage point given that construction output accounts for 6.3% of total output.</p> <p>Despite September\u2019s fall in output, it should be noted that construction output has still seen decent quarter-on-quarter growth for two successive quarters (it rose by 1.9% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter) while latest survey evidence is strong. It therefore seems that the sector is building a decent recovery. </p> <p>Housebuilding activity is seeing particular strength which is welcome news given concerns that a shortage of properties risks contributing to a new housing market bubble. Even so, there needs to be sustained, major growth in housebuilding activity if the housing shortage problem is to be properly addressed.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527cb5b8e4b03445394401d2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-08T10:08:25.374Z\">10.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Airline group IAG benefits from Iberia recovery</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, has been struggling to restructure its Spanish business, amid labour disputes and the defection of customers to budget rivals.</strong></p> <p>But things might be starting to pay off.

As S&amp;P put it this morning \u201cwe believe that the French government\u2019s reforms (\u2026) will not substantially raise France\u2019s medium-term growth prospects\u201d.

      "bodyText": "After those much stronger-than-expected headline numbers in the US jobs report, there has been a mixed finish on European stock markets. In France, the effects of this morning's credit rating cut from Standard and Poor's was felt throughout the day and the CAC40 index has lost 0.6% to 4,257. Get the full story on the French rating cut here. In Germany, where data showed a record trade surplus as exports rose across the board in October, the Dax index has ended almost unchanged, down just 0.1% on the day at 9,066. In the UK, the FTSE 100 has edged up 0.2% to 6,708 against the backdrop of improving sentiment around the US economy. All the market talk in the wake of the US non-farm payrolls numbers is about tapering by the US Federal Reserve being on the near-term horizon. But for now the main share indices are up as optimism about the outlook appears to be trumping fears about stimulus withdrawal on this occasion. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.5% at 15674, the Nasdaq is up 1.2% at 3,903 and the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.7% at a whisker below 1,760. And with that we are closing the blog for today but will be back on Monday with more rolling coverage of business and economic news. Have a good weekend and thank you for reading and commenting. Looking ahead, the Bank of England will take much of the focus during a busy data week in the UK with its quarterly inflation report due on Wednesday against a backdrop of generally upbeat economic indicators in recent weeks. The feeling among City economists is that Mark Carney and the rest of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will have to upgrade their outlook for the economy from August's forecasts. Now that the BoE has adopted a system of forward guidance, there will be more focus than ever on its projections for the labour market. Policymakers have said they will not raise interest rates from their record low 0.5% at least until unemployment has come down to 7%, barring various knockout clauses being triggered. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight comments: It seems highly likely that the November Inflation Report will see a raising of the Bank of England\u2019s growth forecasts and a lowering of its unemployment forecasts, which will open the door to the bank starting to raise interest rates before mid-2016. Capital Economics also expects a downward revision to the MPC\u2019s forecast for the unemployment rate, bringing forward the date at which it is expected to hit the 7% level: The Committee will no doubt emphasise again that the 7% threshold is not an automatic trigger for a policy tightening. But the apparent failure so far to impress this point on the markets points to the risk of a rise in interest rate expectations. Other highlights in the economics calendar next week include: Tuesday: The RICS housing market report, which has shown activity picking up in recent weeks and cited support from the UK government's Help to Buy scehem. UK inflation for October is also due. Wednesday: UK labour market report Thursday: UK retail sales for October and preliminary eurozone GDP data for the third quarter Some less upbeat news from the world's biggest economy now. US consumer confidence defied expectations and fell back in October, according to a survey. Reuters has the story: U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly dipped in November to a near two-year low as lower-income households worried about their job prospects and financial outlooks and negative views of the government lingered, a survey released on Friday showed. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment fell to 72.0 in November, its lowest since December 2011. That was lower than both October's final reading of 73.2 and the 74.5 economists had expected this month. The full story here: U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly falls in November Stock markets are digesting the much stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls numbers for October with traders trying to decide whether to buy on economic buoyancy or sell on the prospect of the Federal Reserve tapering its stimulus programme sooner rather than later. This is how things stand, around 20 minutes after the opening bell on Wall Street: NASDAQ up 0.6% at 3,880 Dow Jones industrial average up 0.2% at 15,618 S&amp;P 500 up 0.2% at 1,750 After their strong debut on Thursday, trading is choppy in shares of the micro-blogging site Twitter today. They are currently down around 0.5% at $44.66 having touched $46.9. At the opening bell on Wall Street, shares are a little higher following that US non-farm payrolls report that smashed expectations with 204,000 jobs. The forecast was for 125,000. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has been looking at the US jobs report. His summary: The US created more than 200,000 fresh jobs in October as the world\u2019s biggest economy shrugged off the impact of the government shutdown. In news that immediately prompted speculation about a winding down of America\u2019s growth stimulus, the Bureau of Labour Statistics published figures showing a much better employment outlook than had been expected. Wall Street had been prepared for an increase of 120,000 in non-farm payrolls last month amid speculation that the temporary layoffs of federal employees would offset job creation in the private sector. The BLS also revised up its estimates of jobs growth in the previous two months \u2013 from 193,000 to 238,000 in August, and from 148,000 to 163,000 in September. Early indications were of a sharp sell off in US shares due to concerns that the increase in payrolls will bring forward the timing of the tapering away of the $85bn (\u00a353bn) a month stimulus provided by the Federal Reserve\u2019s bond buying programme. The US central bank deferred a decision on tapering in September, but is likely to discuss a scaling back of so-called quantitative easing when it meets next month. Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, said: \u201cThe data supports some views out there that the Fed will taper its quantative easing programme in December. However, the impact of the government shutdown in October reduces the reliability of the number, so we hold the view that the Fed will taper in March as opposed to December, once the Fed has seen more proof of improving labour market conditions.\u201d The BLS said almost half the increase in jobs came from two sectors \u2013 a 53,000 increase in the leisure and hospitality sector, and a 44,000 rise in retail employment. Despite the increase in payrolls, the unemployment rate edged up from 7.2% to 7.3%. The employment rate dropped by 0.4 percentage points to 62.8%. James Knightley, at ING bank, said: \u201cThe numbers are much stronger than anyone expected \u2013 the highest forecast in the market was 175,000 for payrolls \u2013 and suggest the government shutdown had a negligible impact on the labour market. However, this goes against anecdotal evidence suggesting that with government contracts not being paid, and the general level of economic uncertainty it created, this led to firms pulling back on hiring.\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at the Capital Economics thinktank says the strong US payrolls number for last month point to the US Federal Reservce starting to scale back its bond-buying stimulus programme in December. He has just sent through this analysis: Together with the news yesterday of a stronger 2.8% gain in third-quarter GDP growth, the Fed now has the data to justify making its first reduction at December's FOMC meeting, but whether it will or not is still unclear. Frankly, given all the flip-flopping, it's hard to know exactly what evidence would satisfy the majority of Fed officials. ... Overall, once again the US economy appears to be overcoming a summer swoon. In our opinion, the data would justify the Fed reducing the pace of its asset purchases in December. The dollar has rallied againt the euro and yen after the stronger-than-expected 204,000 headline number in the US non-farm payrolls report for October. Sentiment around the economic picture has been boosted by upward revisions to the number of jobs added in August and Sepember (60,000 more than previously estimated). But better economic sentiment means more market fretting over the Fed's huge stimulus programme being scaled back. Worries aroun so-called tapering coming sooner rather than later have seen US stock market futures fall sharply. Some reactions to the data: Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit: The data will add to the view that the Fed is gearing towards a tapering of its asset purchases, but policymakers will most likely wait for clearer signs that the economy is capable of growing at a faster rate than seen in recent months, hoping to see a pace of economic growth that will eat into unemployment. An additional bonus was an upward revision to Septembers increase, while August\u2019s total was also revised higher, leading to an extra 60K jobs in those months. The unemployment rate nevertheless ticked higher to 7..3%, up from 7.2% in September, highlighting how the sluggish current pace of economic growth is failing to create enough new jobs to bring down the jobless total. More details from the US Labor Department here. Some highlights: Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 204,000 in October. Job growth averaged 190,000 per month over the prior 12 months. In October, job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, retail trade, professional and technical services, manufacturing, and health care. Federal government employment continued to trend down. There were no discernible impacts of the partial federal government shutdown on the estimates of employment, hours, and earnings from the establishment survey. More detail now on those stronger-than-expected US employment numbers for October. Publishing figures showing that 204,000 non-farm jobs were added - above forecasts for 125,000 - the Labor Department said there were \"no discernable impacts\" of the government shutdown on estimates of earnings and employment hours. The data suggests manufacturing helped boost the pace of employment growth, with factories adding a stronger-than-expected 19,000 jobs in October. US non-farm payrolls have come in at 204,000 compared with expectations for 125,000 from economists. Good afternoon, Katie Allen here taking over from Nick Fletcher. With less than 10 minutes to the keenly awaited US non-farm payrolls numbers, analysts are saying the market reaction is hard to call. The number itself, is always notoriously hard to call too. But this time with the data providing fodder for those trying to guess when the Federal Reserve will start scaling back its stimulus programme - so-called tapering - guessing where a better, or worse, than expected number will send shares and bond yields is a tough one, says Matt Basi, Head of UK Sales Trading at CMC Markets: Calls are for 120k jobs added, and to be honest I have no idea how the market would react in the event of a beat/miss. I suspect a big beat might tug risk assets lower on December tapering concerns, but in reality I just don\u2019t see justification in the broader data for making any changes before the new year and continue to think March will see the first reduction. A number in the 100-120k range could be equity market-positive, and I would plump for a print around 114k. Time for another look at the markets, and the picture has not improved. The French downgrade by S&amp;P is clearly weighing on European shares, while ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers there are growing concerns about when the Federal Reserve might ease off on its bond-buying programme. Following yesterday's strong GDP numbers, a forecast beating jobs number is likely to send further tremours through the markets. As things stand: \u2022 The FTSE 100 is 0.47% lower \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.62% \u2022 France's Cac has fallen 1.04% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is off 0.47% \u2022 Spain's Ibex has lost 0.73% \u2022 Meanwhile the Dow Jones futures are indicating a flat start on Wall Street On that note I'm handing over to my colleague Katie Allen to take you through the non-farm payrolls. The troika of lenders - the ECB, IMF and EU - have issued their statement on Ireland after the country successfully completed the final review of its \u20ac85bn bailout. They said: Ireland's economy has been growing above the euro area average since 2011. Growth prospects for Ireland are strengthening after weakness in the earlier part of this year. Goods exports, retail trade, property prices, and consumer confidence are all increasing. Declining unemployment and improving business surveys suggest that the job creation seen in the first half of this year is continuing, which is a crucial element for a revival of domestic demand. Overall, however, Ireland is expected to record low growth in 2013. A somewhat higher growth rate, of about 1.75%, is projected for 2014 as its trading partners also begin to recover. The 2014 budget targets a primary balance and an overall deficit of 4.8% of GDP, which is more ambitious than the deficit ceiling of 5.1% of GDP set under the excessive deficit procedure. To reach these goals, Ireland\u2019s record of strong budget implementation needs to continue. Realising the proposed savings in health expenditure while protecting core services will require particular attention. Full statement here. More on the UK trade data from my colleague Katie Allen : Britain suffered a drop in exports in September, dealing a blow to the government's hopes to shift the economy away from dependence on squeezed consumers at home. Falling exports were accompanied by a rise in imports leaving Britain's trade gap for September at \u00a39.8bn, the widest for almost a year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The widening gap was largely driven by a drop in exports to the European Union alongside a rise in imports from the region that put Britain's EU trade deficit at a record high. \"An imbalance between domestic and overseas demand continues to characterise the UK economy,\" said Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics. Full story here: Fall in UK exports deals blow to George Osborne's rebalancing hopes A number of broker predictions for the US non-farm payrolls have been summarised by eFXnews: What to expect from non-farm payrolls The range seems to be 100,000 (Goldman) to 130,000 (Citigroup) with most expecting the unemployment rate to rise to 7.5% from 7.2%. Ahead of the US jobless figures, here's a preview from Societe Generale: The bar for US payrolls to surprise to the topside ought to be very low today and in theory should help euro/dollar to cement yesterday\u2019s ECB-induced losses. However, the devil will be in the detail as usual and what constitutes a \u2018good number\u2019 in the sense of labour force participation is really what matters most for investors who try to assess the probability of Fed tapering and shuffle their view accordingly on the US dollar and bonds. The consensus 120,000 figure looks suspiciously low measured against the strong ISM employment indices, so it is reasonable to expect that the whisper number has been bumped up by a decent margin. A gain of 143,000 (average summer gain) will not have investors rushing head over heels to bring forward the expected date of tapering, buy US dollars, sell bonds and buy stocks, but not much should be made either of a forecast rise in the unemployment rate to 7.3% because of temporary lay-offs related to the federal government shutdown. And as Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, pointed out: Following on from the disruption of last month\u2019s US government shutdown, the accuracy of this data will be questioned and revised figures later in the month could paint an entirely different picture. The European Central Bank could come into conflict with Germany after issuing a new legal opinion on banking union. It said the planned EU-wide bank bailout mechanism should include all eurozone banks, saying national systems are inefficient. Germany has already made it clear it believes the new system should begin as a network of national authorities, otherwise a change in legislation would be necessary. In a 32 page report, the ECB said: A strong and independent single resolution authority should be at the centre of the single resolution mechanism, with sufficient decision-making authority to take resolution action in the interest of stability within the euro area and of the European Union as a whole ....The ECB shares the view of the Commission that such a single mechanism is better placed to guarantee optimal resolution action, including adequate burden-sharing, than a network of national resolution authorities. Coordination between national resolution systems has not proved sufficient to achieve the most timely and cost-effective resolution decisions, particularly in a cross- border context. Meanwhile Greek industrial production fell 1.8% year on year in September, after a revised 7.3% fall in the previous month and a 7.8% decline in July. Greece has reported its biggest deflation since 1962, with consumer prices falling 2% on annualised basis in October. The EU-harmonised month on month decline was 1.9%, compared to forecasts of a 1.5% fall. Recession, wage cuts and spare capacity in the economy have sent prices tumbling, according to the statistics service figures. Back to Germany: Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, has - in his usual timely fashion - opined on the latest data, in this case the poor UK trade and construction figures: Disappointing news for the UK economy as the trade deficit remained elevated in September and increased markedly overall in the third quarter and construction output growth was less than estimated in the preliminary national accounts data that showed GDP rising by 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. The poor trade data indicate that net trade was an appreciable drag on GDP growth in the third quarter and was a major factor why expansion did not come in as high as 1.0% quarter-on-quarter as had seemed possible at one point. With total exports edging up just 0.1% month-on-month in September and falling by 2.2% overall in the third quarter, it is evident that the economy is currently far from seeing a hoped-for rebalancing with a greater contribution from exports. Meanwhile, construction output unexpectedly fell by 0.9% month-on-month in September. While not too much should be read into one month\u2019s performance given the well-known volatility in construction output and it followed a strong overall increase in August/July, it nevertheless meant that construction output expanded by 1.7% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter rather than by 2.5% quarter-on-quarter as had been estimated in the preliminary national accounts. In itself, this would mean that GDP growth in the third quarter would be shaved down by 0.05 percentage point given that construction output accounts for 6.3% of total output. Despite September\u2019s fall in output, it should be noted that construction output has still seen decent quarter-on-quarter growth for two successive quarters (it rose by 1.9% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter) while latest survey evidence is strong. It therefore seems that the sector is building a decent recovery. Housebuilding activity is seeing particular strength which is welcome news given concerns that a shortage of properties risks contributing to a new housing market bubble. Even so, there needs to be sustained, major growth in housebuilding activity if the housing shortage problem is to be properly addressed. International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, has been struggling to restructure its Spanish business, amid labour disputes and the defection of customers to budget rivals. But things might be starting to pay off. IAG's third quarter operating profit rose from \u20ac270m to #690m before exceptional items. Iberia made a profit of \u20ac74m, up from just \u20ac1m. But IAG boss Willie Walsh warned: The airline must continue to implement its restructuring plan and reach agreement on productivity changes to bring about long term sustainable profits and growth. The Iberia improvement added to a strong performance from British Airways, and a full quarter's contribution of \u20ac139m from Spanish budget airline Vueling, taken over earlier this year. IAG now expects a full year operating profit os \u20ac740m, above City forecasts. Here's the Reuter's take on the S&amp;P downgrade of France (full story here): Standard &amp; Poor's cut France's sovereign credit rating on Friday by one notch to AA from AA+, giving a thumbs-down to President Francois Hollande's efforts to put the eurozone's second largest economy back on track. All three major ratings agencies had already stripped France of its top-grade triple-A status. S&amp;P is the first to downgrade it for a second time, warning that the economic reforms of the past year were not sufficient to lift growth. The ratings agency adjusted its outlook for French debt to stable from negative, citing Hollande's commitment to containing net general debt, which it expects to peak at 86% of output in 2015. With the Dax down 0.55% at the moment, here's an interesting insight into what spread betting clients are anticipating: The UK trade gap widened by more than expected in September, while construction sector growth was weaker than forecast. The visible trade deficit grew to \u00a39.816bn from \u00a39.557bn in August and much higher than the \u00a39.2bn economists had been expecting. As for construction, third quarter output rose 1.7% quarter on quarter, below the preliminary estimate of 2.5% in the GDP data. (Full statement here) More from our economics correspondent Phillip Inman on the S&amp;P downgrade of France: Economist Julien Manceaux, who works for ING Financial Markets, says S&amp;P's downgrade of the French economy reflects widespread opinion among City analysts that France is resisting the necessary reforms that mean an end to age-old subsidies (to workers and businesses) and labour market reforms to bring more flexibility. Manceaux said in a note that the downgrade from AA+ to AA (following on a first downgrade in January 2012) put France on a par with Belgium (a country with 100% of debt to GDP ratio, albeit with a lower budget deficit) and only two notches above Italy's BBB. He said: This decision confirms what most analysts outside the French Government think. As S&amp;P put it this morning \u201cwe believe that the French government\u2019s reforms (\u2026) will not substantially raise France\u2019s medium-term growth prospects\u201d. GDP growth should not exceed 1% next year which in our view should lead the gross debt to GDP ratio to the brink of 100% by 2015 unless further efforts to cut the size of public spending (at 57% of GDP it is the largest in Europe). This comes as another wake-up call to the French Government so that the competitiveness problem can be addressed more quickly: reforms have been done and are slowly bringing results but they are no reason not to go further. This morning, the financing cost already rose for the French Government from 2.15% to almost 2.4%. This level is of course far from alarming, but at a time of required cost savings, it should push the [prime minister] Jean-Marc Ayrault's government into further efforts to turn the situation around. Here's a chart of French industrial production, courtesy of Markit chief economist Chris Williamson: Phillip Inman, our economics correspondent says analysts are less excited by France's downgrade than Mario Draghi's attempt to kickstart growth with yesterday's 0.25 percentage point rate cut. He points to comments by Philippe Waechter, head of economic research at Natixis Asset Management, who said in a note that the downgrade was less a panic cut in France's creditworthiness and more a shot across the bows for not implementing reforms needed to repair its economy. He said: \"I don't think there will be a dramatic impact on French debt in the short term, because S&amp;P is not expressing alarm and the outlook is stable.\" Still with flotations, in the UK Merlin Entertainments has made a strong start to life as a public company. The owner of Tussauds and Legoland priced its shares at 315p each and they soared to 355p as conditional dealings began before dipping to 349p. At that level the business is valued at around \u00a33.5bn. Retail investors who applied for the minimum of \u00a31,000 of shares were allocated 317 shares worth \u00a3998.55. Those who applied for more than \u00a31,000 were given 317 shares plus 55% of the excess amount, up to a maximum of \u00a327,947 (8,872 shares). The original range for the flotation price was 280p to 330p. Private equity owners Blackstone and CVC, as well as Danish investment firm Kirkbi which controls Lego Group, all sold shares, as did management and employees. Chief executive Nick Varney sold around a third of his stake for around \u00a310m. As well as the US jobs data this afternoon, Twitter will be in focus again after its hottly anticipated flotation got off to a roaring start. No Facebook flop here, with a 73% surge in the shares. My colleague Dominic Rushe's story is here: Twitter share stampede sends firm's value to $24bn on stock market debut Whether it can sustain the rise - which will inevitably bring comments about another dotcom bubble brewing - or whether profit takers will move in, we shall know this afternoon. A quick whizz round the markets, with the S&amp;P downgrade of France doing some damage: \u2022 France's Cac is 0.76% lower \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.6% \u2022 The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.36% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is down 0.13% \u2022 Spain's Ibex is off 0.2% Worries about US tapering after the strong GDP data are also unsettling investors. Here's some of the day's key events: \u2022 UK trade figures 9.30 GMT \u2022 Greece industrial production10.00 GMT \u2022 US non-farm payrolls 1.30 GMT We've already had French industrial production, which is not exactly positive in the wake of the S&amp;P downgrade. It fell by 0.5% month on month in September after rising by 0.7% in the previous month. Analysts has been expecting a 0.2% decline. Meanwhile in Germany, the trade surplus rose to a record \u20ac18.8bn in September, up from a revised \u20ac15.8bn the previous month, as exports surged. This could well reignite the controversy about Germany not doing enough to spur domestic demand. Washington had already waded into the debate, suggesting Germany's reliance on exports was hampering the eurozone recovery, much to Merkel &amp; Co's displeasure. Still with trade, there was a stronger than expected rebound in Chinese exports, up 5.6% and beating market expectations fro a 3.2% increase. Some reaction to the French downgrade. Newedge Strategy said: The debt agency has downgraded France for the second time in less than 2 years as risks of weak activity weigh on the country's finances. We expect French GDP to have remained flat in the third quarter and prospects for the fourth are not much rosier with business confidence indicators that seem to have peaked. Such weak prospects for acticity certainly don't bode well for the labour market that showed further weakness in October, reaching a new high of 3.3m. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. The big event today is the US non-farm payroll figures for October, the first to give an indication of the effects of the recent government shutdown. Analysts are expecting around 120,000 jobs to be created, compared to 148,000 in September. The unemployment rate is forecast to rise from 7.2% to 7.3%. The US Federal Reserve has said it may begin cutting back on its $85bn a month bond buying programme once the rate reaches 7%. Thursday's stronger than expected US GDP figures suggested tapering might begin sooner than expected, pushing Wall Street down by nearly 1%. But if the jobless rate does edge up, the mood could change again. Back in the eurozone comes news that Standard and Poor's has cut its credit rating on France from AA+ to AA, citing concerns about unemployment. All three major ratings agencies recently stripped France of its AAA rating, but S&amp;P is the first to cut the rating again, another blow to President Francois Hollande's attempts to the the eurozone's second largest economy back on track. In a statement S&amp;P said: We believe the French government's reforms to taxation, as well as to product services and labor markets will not substantially raise France's medium term growth prospects. Ongoing high unemployment is weakening support for further significant fiscal and structural policy measures. French finance minister Pierre Moscovici said its debt was among the safest in the world and said the criticisms were inaccurate: During the last 18 months the government has implemented major reforms aimed at improving the French economic situation, restoring its public finances and its competitiveness. But French bond yields have edged up to 2.182% on the news, and the Cac has opened down 0.66%. The euro has dipped 0.2% in early trading. The currency weakened yesterday after the European Central Bank surprisingly cut its key interest rate from 0.5% to 0.25%.",

      "bodyText": "Britain suffered a drop in exports in September, dealing a blow to the government's hopes to shift the economy away from dependence on squeezed consumers at home. Falling exports were accompanied by a rise in imports, leaving Britain's trade gap for September at \u00a39.8bn, the widest for almost a year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The widening gap was largely driven by a drop in exports to the European Union alongside a rise in imports from the region that put Britain's EU trade deficit at a record high. The disappointing numbers prompted a leading business group to accuse the government of doing too little to achieve its economic goals. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce said: \"The UK is not doing enough to plug the export gap and rebalance our economy towards net exports.\" \"While our exporters are looking towards faster-growing markets outside the EU, this process must be accelerated.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast it would narrow to \u00a39.2bn from \u00a39.6bn in August rather than widen.

The bigger gap in the UK for September left the less volatile three-month trade deficit at \u00a329.1bn, up from \u00a325.3bn in the second quarter, and meant trade acted as a drag on the economy in the third quarter.

In news that immediately prompted speculation about a winding down of America\u2019s growth stimulus, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published figures showing a much better employment outlook than had been expected.

Early indications were of a sharp sell off in US shares due to concerns that the increase in payrolls will bring forward the timing of the tapering of the $85bn (\u00a353bn) a month stimulus provided by the Federal Reserve\u2019s bond-buying programme. The US central bank deferred a decision on tapering in September, but is likely to discuss a scaling back of so-called quantitative easing when it meets next month.

Extraordinary.\" 30 \"I should get the Nobel peace prize \u2013 screw Bono.\" 31 \"Nobody wants to sit beside a really fat bastard on board. We have been frankly astonished at the number of customers who not only want to tax fat people but torture them.\" 32 \"I don't give a shit if no one likes me. I'm not a cloud bunny or an aerosexual. I don't like aeroplanes. I never wanted to be a pilot like those other platoons of goons who populate the airline industry.\" 33 And finally, O'Leary on readers of this very organ: \"The chattering bloody classes, or what I call the liberal Guardian readers, they're all buying SUVs to drive around London. I smile at these loons who drive their SUVs down to Sainsbury's and buy kiwi fruit, flown in from New Zealand for Christ sakes. They're the equivalent of environmental nuclear bombs!\"",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "John Lewis pins Christmas hopes on \u00a37m hare and bear advert", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "To borrow a phrase from a key retailing rival: this is not just a Christmas advertising campaign, it's a \u00a37m multi-media festive extravaganza. The new John Lewis seasonal ad campaign, which has become a landmark media event in recent years, takes in television, social media, soft toys, in-store events and even a mini manmade forest on the banks of the Thames. The department store is attempting to repeat the success of its recent Christmas campaigns with a marketing plan much more ambitious than those adopted by high street rivals Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams. While M&amp;S and Debenhams are using their adverts to showcase products that might make good gifts, John Lewis has dispensed with such a direct approach and is instead presenting cuddly images and just one product: an alarm clock. Marketing director Craig Inglis said: \"We are trying to do things differently and always trying to raise the bar.\" The animated advert cost \u00a31m to make and features a hare and a bear created by some of the artists behind Disney's Lion King. It will launch with a film-style \"premiere\" taking up an entire ad break during ITV's X Factor on Saturday. The channel had to rearrange the production schedule for its talent show \u2013 with agreement from X Factor supremo Simon Cowell \u2013 and adjust the evening timetable in order to accommodate the launch. The big-spending campaign reflects a new focus on the small screen and social media by retailers. They will spend about \u00a3390m on ads in the last three months of 2013, according to market analyst Nielsen. Chocolate brand Cadbury's will screen its first ever Christmas TV ad on Friday while the discount chain Lidl has also splashed out on its first festive small screen campaign. The two-minute John Lewis TV ad is the culmination of an event trailed with mystery unbranded ads on ITV, featuring footage of the bear, which has fuelled a storm of intrigue on Twitter under the hashtag #sleepingbear. Anticipation has also been driven by an installation on the South Bank, London, marked with the same hashtag, where teaser clips of the ad are being projected. From this weekend, the hare and bear theme will be reflected in special events in stores and an array of linked products including soft toy versions of the advert's stars. It will debut on social media channels on Friday, reflecting a growing trend among companies from all industries, who are expected to spend 11% more online in the last quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2012. Sarah Vizard, retail specialist at trade journal Marketing Week, said: \"It makes sense to be online and across social media, as this is where the most loyal customers are.\" But she also warned that the department store risked over-reaching itself with the enormous hype around the ad. She said: \"They are making a huge statement and people may ask 'who do they think they are?'\" John Lewis has spent \u00a36m on buying TV airtime and a further \u00a31m on supporting press, online, cinema and events-based marketing. Inglis said the campaign was much more integrated across a range of different media than last year's effort which featured lovelorn snowmen. He said: \"We are hoping the bear and the hare will enter the public psyche a bit like the snowmen last year.\" The ad features hand-drawn animation by Florida-based artists led by former Disney animator Aaron Blaise, who previously worked on the Lion King and Pocahontas. The animation, which took six months to create, was combined with a set built and filmed in a studio in south London, using a technique not used on TV in the UK since the days of the original Paddington cartoon. The ad features Lily Allen singing Keane's 2004 hit Somewhere Only We Know. Last year John Lewis used Gabrielle Aplin's cover of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's Power of Love, which became a No 1 single. This year's slightly melancholic old-fashioned story, in which a hare gives his bear friend an alarm clock so that he can wake from hibernation in time to enjoy Christmas, is a complete contrast to M&amp;S's glossy Alice in Wonderland-themed ad which features models David Gandy and a semi-naked Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, or Debenhams' traditional romantic TV spot featuring its designers from its in-house labels. Inglis said that John Lewis was very aware that the ad could face criticism for over-reaching itself or \"tall poppy syndrome\". He said: \"We are very aware of it and hope the way we approach things counterbalances that. We have a twinkle in our eye,\" he said. \"It's not all about glitz and glamour, it's all about animation and the brand. We are using other media to say more about products. This is really about telling a story and making that emotional connection.\" Retailers compete to be X Factor winners ITV is set for a bumper November as the big retailers vie for the top advertising slots. John Lewis is understood to have paid \u00a3750,000 to take over an entire ad break during this Saturday's X Factor and, according to advertising sources, the broadcaster is charging up to \u00a380,000 for 30-second spots during the show \u2013 up 10% overall on last year. Saturday's X Factor will see both the department store chain and Asda supermarket group launch their Christmas TV campaigns, looking to tap into the show's seven million-plus viewers. Despite the X Factor Saturday show losing about 10% of viewers over the past 12 months, advertisers still view the programme as a launch pad for major campaigns. December is expected to bring further good news for ITV, as ad slots for the X Factor semi-final will cost advertisers as much as \u00a3140,000 \u2013 and \u00a3180,000 for the final, even though the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing is attracting larger audiences than its Saturday rival According to media buying experts, one reason advertisers are prepared to pay out such big money for the ad spots is the social media activity now generated by shows such as X Factor and Downton Abbey. Simon Davis, chief executive of the Walker Media agency, said: \"With audiences fragmenting, demand for high-reach, talked-about TV is increasing as brands look to big shows to launch their campaigns and ride on the back of the show's social chatter to hopefully generate conversations of their own through Twitter and Facebook. \"X Factor can generate up to 10,000 tweets per minute.\" Chris Davies, broadcast account director at media agency Universal McCann, said: \"Christmas advertisers appear to be placing a stake in the ground, launching integrated campaigns earlier to stay ahead of the competition. \"Social media is playing an increasingly larger role. Where once a newspaper ad would signal the start of a TV campaign, it's now a promoted tweet or page post on Facebook. \"Within this activity, TV retains its role as the bedrock of the campaigns, and ITV's weekend offering, be it X Factor or Downtown Abbey, helps to place it at the heart of the British home.\"",

While M&amp;S and Debenhams are using their adverts to showcase products that might make good gifts, John Lewis has dispensed with such a direct approach and is instead presenting cuddly images and just one product: an alarm clock.</p> <p>Marketing director Craig Inglis said: \"We are trying to do things differently and always trying to raise the bar.\"</p> <p>The animated advert cost \u00a31m to make and features a hare and a bear created by some of the artists behind Disney's Lion King. It will launch with a film-style \"premiere\" taking up an entire ad break during ITV's X Factor on Saturday. The channel had to rearrange the production schedule for its talent show \u2013 with agreement from X Factor supremo Simon Cowell \u2013 and adjust the evening timetable in order to accommodate the launch.</p> <p>The big-spending campaign reflects a new focus on the small screen and social media by retailers. They will spend about \u00a3390m on ads in the last three months of 2013, according to market analyst Nielsen. Chocolate brand Cadbury's will screen its first ever Christmas TV ad on Friday while the discount chain Lidl has also splashed out on its first festive small screen campaign.</p> <p>The two-minute John Lewis TV ad is the culmination of an event trailed with mystery unbranded ads on ITV, featuring footage of the bear, which has fuelled a storm of intrigue on Twitter under the hashtag #sleepingbear.</p> <p>Anticipation has also been driven by an installation on the South Bank, London, marked with the same hashtag, where teaser clips of the ad are being projected. From this weekend, the hare and bear theme will be reflected in special events in stores and an array of linked products including soft toy versions of the advert's stars.</p> <p>It will debut on social media channels on Friday, reflecting a growing trend among companies from all industries, who are expected to spend 11% more online in the last quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2012.</p> <p>Sarah Vizard, retail specialist at trade journal Marketing Week, said: \"It makes sense to be online and across social media, as this is where the most loyal customers are.\" But she also warned that the department store risked over-reaching itself with the enormous hype around the ad. She said: \"They are making a huge statement and people may ask 'who do they think they are?'\"</p> <p>John Lewis has spent \u00a36m on buying TV airtime and a further \u00a31m on supporting press, online, cinema and events-based marketing.</p> <p>Inglis said the campaign was much more integrated across a range of different media than last year's effort which featured lovelorn snowmen. He said: \"We are hoping the bear and the hare will enter the public psyche a bit like the snowmen last year.\"</p> <p>The ad features hand-drawn animation by Florida-based artists led by former Disney animator Aaron Blaise, who previously worked on the Lion King and Pocahontas. The animation, which took six months to create, was combined with a set built and filmed in a studio in south London, using a technique not used on TV in the UK since the days of the original Paddington cartoon.</p> <p>The ad features Lily Allen singing Keane's 2004 hit Somewhere Only We Know. Last year John Lewis used Gabrielle Aplin's cover of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's Power of Love, which became a No 1 single.</p> <p>This year's slightly melancholic old-fashioned story, in which a hare gives his bear friend an alarm clock so that he can wake from hibernation in time to enjoy Christmas, is a complete contrast to M&amp;S's glossy Alice in Wonderland-themed ad which features models David Gandy and a semi-naked Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, or Debenhams' traditional romantic TV spot featuring its designers from its in-house labels.</p> <p>Inglis said that John Lewis was very aware that the ad could face criticism for over-reaching itself or \"tall poppy syndrome\". He said: \"We are very aware of it and hope the way we approach things counterbalances that. We have a twinkle in our eye,\" he said. \"It's not all about glitz and glamour, it's all about animation and the brand. We are using other media to say more about products. This is really about telling a story and making that emotional connection.\"</p> <h2>Retailers compete to be X Factor winners </h2> <p>ITV is set for a bumper November as the big retailers vie for the top advertising slots. John Lewis is understood to have paid \u00a3750,000 to take over an entire ad break during this Saturday's X Factor and, according to advertising sources, the broadcaster is charging up to \u00a380,000 for 30-second spots during the show \u2013 up 10% overall on last year.</p> <p>Saturday's X Factor will see both the department store chain and Asda supermarket group launch their Christmas TV campaigns, looking to tap into the show's seven million-plus viewers.</p> <p>Despite the X Factor Saturday show losing about 10% of viewers over the past 12 months, advertisers still view the programme as a launch pad for major campaigns.</p> <p>December is expected to bring further good news for ITV, as ad slots for the X Factor semi-final will cost advertisers as much as \u00a3140,000 \u2013 and \u00a3180,000 for the final, even though the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing is attracting larger audiences than its Saturday rival</p> <p>According to media buying experts, one reason advertisers are prepared to pay out such big money for the ad spots is the social media activity now generated by shows such as X Factor and Downton Abbey.</p> <p>Simon Davis, chief executive of the Walker Media agency, said: \"With audiences fragmenting, demand for high-reach, talked-about TV is increasing as brands look to big shows to launch their campaigns and ride on the back of the show's social chatter to hopefully generate conversations of their own through Twitter and Facebook.</p> <p>\"X Factor can generate up to 10,000 tweets per minute.\"</p> <p>Chris Davies, broadcast account director at media agency Universal McCann, said: \"Christmas advertisers appear to be placing a stake in the ground, launching integrated campaigns earlier to stay ahead of the competition.</p> <p>\"Social media is playing an increasingly larger role.
