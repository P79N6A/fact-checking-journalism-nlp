    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne is hoping expected second-quarter growth figures published on Thursday of around 0.6% will be seen as a long-awaited economic and political watershed, marking the return of sustained growth and ending three years of an economy bumping along the bottom. The Treasury will try to maintain a cautious posture but start to put the political squeeze on the shadow Treasury team by claiming its dire predictions of mass unemployment have been proved untrue. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, in the US for talks with the Obama administration, has already prepared the ground for the change of economic gear by highlighting the continued squeeze on living standards. Balls has privately long acknowledged that growth will pick up well before the 2015 election, but is convinced that the massive wage squeeze, leaving living standards at 2004-5 levels, will make it impossible for Osborne to try to generate a political feelgood factor. The Balls team are also pointing out that the chancellor is still planning massive spending cuts in 2015-16. Chris Leslie, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said: \"City forecasters are expecting growth of up to 0.8% this quarter and, after three years of flatlining, it's about time we had some growth in our economy. \"But with living standards still falling and the IMF warning we are a long way from a strong and sustained recovery the chancellor should be acting to ensure we catch up all the ground we have lost over the last few years.\" He added that to lift the economy to where the Treasury had expected it to be by the end of the parliament, growth would need to be 5.3% a year over the next two years. Experts are forecasting growth figures for the second quarter of around 0.6% to follow an increase of 0.3% in the first three months of 2013. The quarterly industrial trends survey by the CBI found manufacturers started the summer in buoyant mood following the first rise in new orders for a year. Firms increased production and employment as the outlook for the sector improved in the three months to the end of July. The quarterly industrial trends survey also found that firms anticipated a further modest rise in orders and output in the coming three months, while expectations for growth in new domestic orders were at their highest since April last year. However, the improving situation, which is also reflected in other surveys of manufacturers, failed to persuade firms to increase investment in new equipment. The CBI said planned capital expenditure on plant and machinery over the next 12 months had deteriorated slightly. \"When asked about factors likely to limit investment, manufacturers most often cited uncertainty about demand, which was of slightly greater concern than usual,\" the CBI said. The Office for Budget Responsibility, which monitors the economy for its impact on the government's finances, has pencilled in a recovery in investment over the next two years to underpin a return to average growth levels. Manufacturers' intentions to invest in plant and machinery dipped -1% compared with -9% in the previous quarter. The survey's main total-orders balance picked up from -18 in June to -12, which is its strongest level since last December. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the sector's recovery was gathering momentum, though at a slower pace than the services sector. \"This improvement brings the CBI's survey in line with the relatively upbeat tone of the other surveys. \"But with demand for exports weak in the UK's largest market, the eurozone, and domestic consumers' real pay still being squeezed, it is hard to see how the manufacturing sector's recovery can gather much more pace in the near term,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "The autumn fashion lines from Marks &amp; Spencer, which have been filtering into stores in the past couple of weeks and will formally launch on Thursday, are the first to be entirely guided by company's new womenswear management team. M&amp;S clothing and homewares sales have been drifting backwards for two years, and Marc Bolland, the chief executive, is under pressure from shareholders to show a marked improvement this autumn. This week, in London, shoppers were divided over whether the new coats and jumpers ranges indicated improvement. There was a buzz at the firm's flagship Marble Arch store, set to display its autumn ranges, as prints, sleeve lengths and fabric quality were pondered over. \"It really doesn't look much different than before,\" said one shopper, Anne, who was also an M&amp;S shareholder and regularly attendee at the retailer's annual meetings. \"I do really want them to get it right. In menswear they have great tailoring of good quality made in Italy, but in womenswear the suits seem very cheap. I would spend the money for good quality.\" Pat Salisbury, 66, was pleased with a sparkly tailored cardigan she had bought and liked some T-shirts with flattering mid-length sleeves. \"Some of the clothes look much better, more modern, but I'm not sure about the changes to the Per Una range. They've gone away from the embroidery and beading I liked, and if I walked through the door I'm not sure I could tell it from Autograph or M&amp;S Woman. Perhaps it's getting confused.\" A number of shoppers were pleased to note signs of a move away from the \"frumpy\" styles they had been turned off by on previous shopping trips. Two glamorous octogenarian sisters, Annie Redzinski and Josephine Frost, were impressed by some of the coats and tailoring. \"We want to see more of this in our local store.\" It was a view echoed by several other shoppers.

There was a buzz at the firm's flagship Marble Arch store, set to display its autumn ranges, as prints, sleeve lengths and fabric quality were pondered over.</p> <p>\"It really doesn't look much different than before,\" said one shopper, Anne, who was also an M&amp;S shareholder and regularly attendee at the retailer's annual meetings. \"I do really want them to get it right. In menswear they have great tailoring of good quality made in Italy, but in womenswear the suits seem very cheap. I would spend the money for good quality.\"</p> <p>Pat Salisbury, 66, was pleased with a sparkly tailored cardigan she had bought and liked some T-shirts with flattering mid-length sleeves. \"Some of the clothes look much better, more modern, but I'm not sure about the changes to the Per Una range. They've gone away from the embroidery and beading I liked, and if I walked through the door I'm not sure I could tell it from Autograph or M&amp;S Woman. Perhaps it's getting confused.\"</p> <p>A number of shoppers were pleased to note signs of a move away from the \"frumpy\" styles they had been turned off by on previous shopping trips.</p> <p>Two glamorous octogenarian sisters, Annie Redzinski and Josephine Frost, were impressed by some of the coats and tailoring. \"We want to see more of this in our local store.\" It was a view echoed by several other shoppers.</p> <p>Amanda Carr who writes The Women's Room blog for 40-something fashion fans, said M&amp;S was doing a better job at showing customers how to build outfits andthere were signs of improvement, particularly with knitwear.</p> <p>But she added: \"For me there are still issues with print, colour and a tendency to overdesign which is a massive weakness.

      "body": "<p>Since President Obama took office in 2009, he has repeatedly sworn to tackle America's economic malaise. \"If President Barack Obama's new focus on the economy sounds familiar, that's because he's done it before,\" the Associated Press <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/politics/ci_23706224/obama-begin-new-series-economic-addresses\">noted archly this week</a>. \"Obama has been launching\u2014and re-launching\u2014initiatives on the economy. Some came with new policy proposals, others with catchy slogans.\"</p> <p>The White House's <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/07/20/youre-going-want-watch-speech\">own video compilation</a> for Obama's speeches on the economy is an unwitting testament to lost determination, false starts, and unmet demands for action. </p> <p>Still, spurring economic growth, like getting to Carnegie Hall, does require some practice. The clock is running on the 2014 elections, and the president needs to shore up his record to help his fellow Democrats. He also needs America to stop thinking about the White House's failed pushes on gun control and immigration reform, and start thinking about job creation.</p> <p>It's a good time to revisit exactly what the president said he has valued most. Here are the highlights of four years of economic policy statements \u2013 and their results.</p> <h2>Minimum wage increases</h2> <p>In this year's state of the union, Obama pushed $9 minimum wage. </p> <p>\"Minimum wage increases are not accompanied by job losses,\" said Alan Krueger. \"It puts money in their pockets.\" \"This is returning the minimum wage, after inflation, to 1981 \u2026 when President Reagan came to office. ... A family making minimum wage should be able to raise their family in dignity above the poverty line.\"</p> <p><strong>Result:</strong> Obama pushed this suggestion at several other speeches after the state of the union, but <a href=\"http://thehill.com/video/administration/298873-obama-pushes-9-minimum-wage-bill-in-texas-visit#ixzz2ZyNIwN9U\">dropped it</a> as immigration reform came to the forefront of the legislative agenda. </p> <h2>Federal deficit</h2> <p>\"Together, we've agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2tn,\" Obama boasted in the 2012 state of the union.</p> <p><strong>Result:</strong> The deficit has indeed shrunk dramatically \u2013 to around $489bn, compared to $720bn at the same time last year \u2013 and, according to some accounts, is even <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/05/09/our-swiftly-melting-deficit-or-how-the-u-s-is-killing-it.html\">skating on the edge</a> of a surplus. </p> <h2>Manufacturing innovation and reshoring</h2> <p>In both the 2012 and 2013 state of the union addresses, Obama praised companies like Ford, Caterpillar and Master Lock for bringing jobs back to the United States. \"American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s,\" Obama said in 2012. \"So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back. But we have to seize it.\" The<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/15/president-obama-travels-master-lock-company-milwaukee-wisconsin-discuss-\"> White House predicted</a> that such jobs would result in $16bn of investment and add 12,000 jobs in the US by 2015. </p> <p>Many companies, like Apple, have made enthusiastic statements about bringing some manufacturing operations back to the US.</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/24/us-manufacturing-troubled-promise-reshoring\">piece for the Guardian today</a>, Mubin S Khan notes that the actions have fallen behind the words: fewer than 100 companies have actually brought manufacturing jobs back to America; in addition, some of those companies are maintaining the bulk of their manufacturing operations overseas and only bringing back a small number of factories to America. Of those factories, many will be automated, Khan notes, which will not result in more jobs. In addition, 12,000 jobs, while surely welcome, would still leave the manufacturing sector millions of jobs short of its peak.</p> <h2>Financial reform:</h2> <p>In the state of the union, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/13/open-questions-state-union-and-economy\">Obama said</a>: \"We've put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again.\"</p> <p><strong>Result:</strong> Obama was referring to the Dodd-Frank financial reform effort, which is skating on the brink of failure. <a href=\"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/dodd-frank-three-years-later/304/\">A Washington Post analysis</a> shows that 62% of the bill's deadlines have been missed and a more embarrassing <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/banks-lobbyists-help-in-drafting-financial-bills/\">New York Times story</a> found that lobbyists were literally writing the legislation to suit their own interests.</p> <h2>Immigration reform</h2> <p>The White House, in most recent efforts to <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2013/07/12/weekly-address-strengthening-our-economy-passing-bipartisan-immigr\">save immigration reform</a>, started selling it as a form of economic stimulus, as <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2013/07/11/white-house-white-board-why-immigration-reform-good-our-economy\">in this video</a>. According to some studies, a majority of Americans agree that granting illegal immigrants legal status would boost the economy, and some studies show that having <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/24/immigration-reform-economy_n_3489843.html\">more legal immigrants</a> would provide a boost to the wages of native workers. </p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Immigration reform, which passed the Senate, is now assumed to be stalled in the House, although organizations like La Raza are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/us/latino-leaders-planning-push-for-immigration-bill.html?ref=immigrationandemigration\">redoubling their efforts</a>. In terms of this particular legislation's claim to be an economic stimulus, there have been doubts. Highly skilled workers, for instance, would still face an uphill battle <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/big-data-analysis-adds-to-guest-worker-debate/?ref=immigrationandemigration\">to stay in the United States</a> because of the assumption that they would be taking jobs away from educated Americans.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/sunday-review/being-legal-doesnt-end-poverty.html?ref=immigrationandemigration\">New York Times analysis</a> found that being a citizen does not end poverty for immigrants. A Daily Beast commentary suggested that the immigration bill in its current form would feed immigrants into a series of low-paying dead-end jobs and reduce the economic power of the <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/14/the-immigration-hustle-a-new-class-war-on-the-besieged-middle-class.html\">native working class.</a> </p> <h2>Corporate America job creation</h2> <p>In 2012, Obama said: \"Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed.\" In another State of the Union, he noted, \"Our economy is adding jobs \u2013 but too many people still can't find full-time employment. Corporate profits have rocketed to all-time highs \u2013 but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged.\" </p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> This is the group Obama has yet to win over. Corporate America has been as slow to embrace economic stimulus as Congress has. Whether this is due to a lack of demand or merely a desire to return more money to shareholders, there's been a notable lack of participation from major companies in the endeavor to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/23/ben-bernanke-corporate-america-not-doing-job\">reduce the unemployment crisis</a>. </p> <p>There was some talk of tax breaks for corporations looking to bring money back to the United States, or repatriation, but that effort seems to have fizzled. Similarly, the president's <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2013/07/23/many-say-economic-recovery-is-still-a-long-way-off/7-23-2013-1/\">focus on corporate tax breaks</a> has borne little fruit. </p> <h2>Ending the general financial malaise</h2> <p>This year, the president offered an optimistic view on the economic recovery.</p> <p>\"After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs. We buy more American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than we have in twenty. Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before.\"</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> The economic malaise is still very real to many Americans. Most Americans believe the US is still in recession, and have said <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2013/07/23/many-say-economic-recovery-is-still-a-long-way-off/7-23-2013-1/\">they consider the recovery</a> a long way off. </p> <h2>Other economic plans</h2> <p>Obama has repeatedly said the goal of his economic policies is to reduce income inequality, and boost the middle class. \"It is our generation's task, then, to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth \u2013 a rising, thriving middle class,\" he said. Obama also noted an ambitious desire to look at the core causes of the slow economy: \"How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills needed to do those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?\"</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> These are the questions that, as yet, have had no answers. Congress has not passed a stimulus bill in years. The president's goal is to change that.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hopes of a recovery in the eurozone were lifted after private sector firms across the region reported a rise in output for the first time in 18 months, leading to predictions that the single currency bloc is on the cusp of exiting recession. A strong performance by German manufacturers and a halt to the headlong decline in French business activity gave the eurozone a much needed boost after the area slipped into reverse last year. With the US manufacturing sector expanding at a faster pace in July, the main blot on the global economic recovery was a decline in manufacturing output in China that some economists have warned could force Beijing to renew its stimulus spending or risk a hard landing. China's manufacturing sector tempered the eurozone data, slowing to an 11-month low as new orders faltered and the job market darkened. The flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 47.7 this month from June's final reading of 48.2, marking a third straight month below the 50 threshold between expansion and contraction for China. As if to highlight concerns that global growth is slowing, Caterpillar, the US construction and mining business that is considered a bellwether of global business activity, downgraded its forecast for the pace of the global recovery this year and next. Alexandra Knight, an economist at National Australia Bank, said the weak Chinese PMI posed a problem for countries that relied on exports to China. \"It adds to the concern about the outlook for demand, and brings into question just how strong Chinese commodities demand will be,\" she said. Several analysts said the contraction in activity was overplayed by the survey and the manufacturing sector was stronger than many believed. But scepticism over official data supplied by Beijing and a growing credit bubble has convinced other economists that China will do well to avoid a full-blown recession. Nervous stock markets remained steady as they digested the news, with the FTSE 100 climbing 23 points to 6620, though oil slipped towards $107 a barrel as the prospect of higher demand evaporated. Despite the global outlook, policymakers in Brussels will be buoyed by the monthly healthcheck of firms in the euro area that found that manufacturing output has risen for the first time since February 2012. Service sector firms are also pulling out of their long decline, with France and Germany leading the way out of the downturn. Data provider Markit, which compiles the monthly Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), said the figures showed the eurozone was stabilising. \"The best PMI reading for one-and-a-half years provides encouraging evidence to suggest that the euro area could, at long last, pull out of its recession in the third quarter,\" predicted Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. Markit's composite PMI rose to 50.4, from 48.7 in June, which is the best reading since January 2012. Any figure over 50 indicates growth. Germany's service sector growth hit a five-month high and French factories, which have suffered through the country's downturn, returned to growth with the strongest performance in 17 months. \"Today's PMI data corroborate our assessment that the eurozone economy is slowly moving from contraction to stabilization,\" said Tom Rogers, senior economic adviser at EY. Even so, Rogers said a \"real recovery remains a long way off,\" with jobs continuing to be shed in a number of countries in the region and amid tight bank credit conditions for companies. The European Central Bank has unveiled a new plan to boost lending to firms, but it's unclear how long it will take to have an impact. \"Much more remains to be done by both the ECB and governments if the recovery in the coming 12-18 months is not to be weak and prone to setbacks,\" Rogers said. Figures from Paris showed unemployment in France rose to a new record of 3.28 million in a fresh blow to President Francois Hollande's pledge to cut down unemployment by year-end. Economic output in the eurozone has been shrinking since the last three months of 2011, the longest recession since the single currency was created. Data due out in August will show whether the trend continued in the second quarter of 2013. Markit reported that eurozone firms continued to cut staff, but at a lower rate than earlier this year. Williamson said the PMI report will provide \"a summer fillip to policymakers, especially in terms of there being light at the end of the tunnel for austerity-hit periphery countries where political and social tensions have risen\". The euro hit a one month high of $1.3249 against the US dollar after the data was released.",

He said the level of his bonus \u2013 which totalled \u00a32.7m last year \u2013 is \"really a matter for the board\".</p> <p>Witty added that he was \"absolutely committed to rooting out corruption and we are absolutely committed to getting to the bottom of what has happened\".</p> <p>The GSK boss, who was paid \u00a33.9m last year, said he was \"absolutely willing and ready\" to go to China to head up the company's investigation. However, he is leaving the day-to-day handling of the crisis to Abbas Hussain, GSK's head of emerging markets, who flew out to China take control of the situation last week.</p> <p>He refused to provide details of how the alleged fraud operated, but said the Chinese policeinvestigation is focused on the four Chinese nationals already detained by the police. He said they appear to have been \"potentially defrauding GSK and also at the same time allegedly doing some things in the market which are clearly inappropriate and illegal\".</p> <p>The Chinese investigators have \"no allegations\" against Mark Reilly, the British head of GSK China, or Steve Nechelput, its finance director in the country, Witty said.

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline has insisted the British drugs group had no knowledge of the alleged cash and sexual favours bribery scandal which has engulfed the company in China before the police arrested four of its senior Chinese executives last week. Sir Andrew Witty, GSK's chief executive, said the company's headquarters had \"no sense\" of the \"shameful\" and \"deeply disappointing\" allegations that some GSK China executives are the \"godfathers\" of a criminal scam, bribing doctors with cash and sexual favours worth \u00a3320m. Witty, who was speaking publicly about the \"fraudulent behaviour\" for the first time, said: \"It appears that certain senior executives in the Chinese business have acted outside of our processes and our controls to both defraud the company and the Chinese healthcare system.\" He said the company has \"zero tolerance\" for the alleged behaviour, which is \"totally contrary\" to GSK's values. However, he repeatedly refused to say if he would hand back some of his bonus this year if the company was found to have broken the law in China. He said the level of his bonus \u2013 which totalled \u00a32.7m last year \u2013 is \"really a matter for the board\". Witty added that he was \"absolutely committed to rooting out corruption and we are absolutely committed to getting to the bottom of what has happened\". The GSK boss, who was paid \u00a33.9m last year, said he was \"absolutely willing and ready\" to go to China to head up the company's investigation. However, he is leaving the day-to-day handling of the crisis to Abbas Hussain, GSK's head of emerging markets, who flew out to China take control of the situation last week. He refused to provide details of how the alleged fraud operated, but said the Chinese policeinvestigation is focused on the four Chinese nationals already detained by the police. He said they appear to have been \"potentially defrauding GSK and also at the same time allegedly doing some things in the market which are clearly inappropriate and illegal\". The Chinese investigators have \"no allegations\" against Mark Reilly, the British head of GSK China, or Steve Nechelput, its finance director in the country, Witty said. He said Reilly, who has left China for the UK, and Nechelput, who the Chinese have banned from leaving the country, have been helping GSK with its investigation. Witty said GSK's head office in London had no knowledge of the alleged fraudulent activity until the Chinese police raid its offices in Shanghai earlier this month. \"As far as headquarters, we had no sense of this issue.\" This is despite GSK declaring last month that a four-month internal investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption in China found \"no evidence of corruption or bribery in our China business\". Witty said the previous allegations raised by a whistleblower were \"quite different\" to the new charges. \"They are two completely different sets of issues: we fully investigated the first and of course this has now surfaced in the last couple of weeks,\" he said. GSK has already pumped in extra cash into its investigations team in China to help them to get to the bottom of the scandal, Witty said. Despite the apparent serious breach of compliance, Witty said GSK's controls and audit systems are \"extremely robust\", but promised the company would \"learn from this and make changes\". It comes a year after Witty promised a company-wide overhaul to prevent a repeat of a scandal in which GSK staff tricked and bribed doctors into prescribing dangerous antidepressants to children in the US. \"We're determined this is never going to happen again,\" he said last summer after GSK paid a record $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) fine to settle the claim. GSK has \"reached out\" to regulators in the UK and the US and has \"consulted with the UK government\" about the Chinese investigation. He warned that the allegations are likely to have \"some impact\" on GSK's future performance in China, but said it was \"too early to quantify the extent\". GSK reported a 2% rise in second-quarter sales to \u00a36.6bn. Its drug and vaccine sales in China rose 14% to \u00a3212m. China accounts for just over 3% of the company's global sales. China indicated that its investigation into the \"rampant\" bribery scandal will be extended to other foreign and local drug companies. \"It will not be surprising if more pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, domestic or international, are to be involved in probes in the days to come,\" the Chinese state news agency said yesterday. \"Big international firms should shoulder [their] due responsibilities to bid farewell to malpractice, setting a good example and serving as a wake-up call for domestic pharmaceutical companies.\"",

      "bodyText": "Hark the words of Robert Jenkins, former external member of the Bank of England's financial policy committee, earlier this month: \"I fear that the banks have bamboozled government into believing that society must choose between safety and growth, between safer banks and bank shareholder value, and between a safer financial framework and a competitive City of London. These are all false choices.\" Bad news, Mr Jenkins, your fears are well founded. On the evidence of Vince Cable's extraordinary outburst to the FT, the government has indeed been well and truly bamboozled. The business secretary used and endorsed the phrase \"capital Taliban\" to describe Bank of England officials. The term is bankers' favourite way to insult the Bank and, aside from bad taste, there are two reasons why a cabinet member should not use it. First, the criticism of the Bank's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) is plain wrong: asking banks to hold more capital should not impede lending. Second, ministers should keep their noses out of the day-to-day judgments of the independent regulator. This row has broken out after the PRA demanded that lenders achieve leverage ratios of 3% \u2013 that is, that they should hold \u00a33 of capital to support \u00a3100 of lending. By no stretch of the imagination can 3%, implying a 33 times levered balance sheet, be regarded as an onerous demand. The Vickers commission argued for 4%, meaning a leverage cap of 25 times, and the US is heading towards 5%. Nor is a 3% leverage ratio for British banks hard to achieve in practice. All the main lenders apart from Nationwide and Barclays are there already. Nationwide \u2013 conceivably an institution with a \"safe\" book of mortgage assets \u2013 has been given until the end of 2015 to fall into line. The PRA's verdict on when Barclays must conform is awaited eagerly, making the timing of Cable's comments appalling. The key point is that more capital and more lending go hand-in-hand, as Sir Mervyn King stressed time and again when he was governor. \"Capital supports lending and provides resilience. And, without a resilient banking system, it will be difficult to sustain a recovery,\" King said in his last Mansion House speech. Cable seems to have swallowed the bankers' line that the regulator is making them assemble vast sums of capital that could otherwise be used to lend to small businesses. No, that is not how the system works: to repeat, weakly capitalised banks won't lend because they can't lend. And getting more capital into the system looks a sensible policy when the starting point is a banking industry that is still hugely over-leveraged by historical standards. As Jenkins says, we don't have to choose between safety and growth. Of course, it suits the lenders to muddy the waters. Barclays would be unpopular with its shareholders if it had to whack them with a rights issue to find capital in a hurry. Nationwide has a particular reason to worry because it is a building society without access to shareholder capital. But the PRA's job is to manage financial stability. By speaking out, Cable makes it harder for the Bank to be seen to act independently. What if Barclays is next week given a Nationwide-style waiver to meet the 3% ratio by the end of 2015? Would that be because the PRA is satisfied with the current financial strength of Barclays or because the regulators have been intimidated by Cable and the Treasury, which apparently shares the view that jihadists are running amok in Threadneedle Street? Mark Carney, the new governor, should be spitting blood. He's got a tough job. He doesn't need politicians who make it harder. Cable, who in opposition was quick to spot the danger in running an under-capitalised banking system, should know better.",

Jeffers moved up to the highest-paid job in the plant and became the president of Local 8183 of the United Steelworkers. Now he's fighting to save 700 jobs as his plant, like so many others before it, faces a grim Christmas season in a few months' time: mass layoffs a few weeks before Thanksgiving and complete closure of the plant on New Year's Eve. Horsehead, struggling with high electricity prices and the cost of new environmental regulations, failed to get tax incentives it wanted from the state of Pennsylvania to reduce its costs. The company is economizing \u2013 sending its prime western zinc plant operations to North Carolina, and downsizing to only one zinc oxide plant in Canada, close to Michelin's operations. The diaspora of manufacturing jobs is an old story in the American landscape \u2013 but, as President Obama's optimistic speeches about the rebirth of manufacturing have shown, the old dream dies hard. Since 2010, a new buzzword has taken root: reshoring. This bit of corporate jargon captures the hope that the golden age of factories will return with a bounty of well-paid union jobs and thriving local economies. There is a lot of lost ground. The manufacturing industry's share of GDP stands at a meager 11.5% \u2013 down from 28% in the 1950s \u2013 and it employs half the number of people it did in the 1980s. During the US recession of 2007 to 2009, manufacturing jobs were the hardest hit, with 2 million jobs lost in just 15 months. In his most recent state of the union address, Obama promised to make \"America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing\", in part to boost the middle class. Studies suggest that a single manufacturing job has the potential to create two and half jobs elsewhere in the economy; the industry pays 20% more than the service sector for a similar set of employee skills and drives consumer spending and exports. The buzz has been growing to a point of headiness: American giants including Apple, General Electric, Ford, Chrysler, Whirlpool, Lenovo and Caterpillar have all started setting up new plants or reinvesting in old plants in the US. The Boston Consulting Group predicted that up to 5 million manufacturing and related service jobs will be returning by 2020.\" The White House promised last year that major American companies like Ford will invest $16bn at home and add 12,000 jobs in the US by 2015. The president praised companies like Master Lock for revitalizing America's economy. \"Right now we have an excellent opportunity to bring manufacturing back \u2013 but we have to seize it,\" the president said last year. That golden age, however, has in reality proven elusive. As the US adds a small number of jobs to a slowly-recovering economy, the number of people like Jeffers who are finding themselves out of work at a manufacturing plant is still significant. Monaca is a prime example of the tradeoffs of reshoring: as the Horsehead plant closes and takes 700 jobs with it, a new Shell petrochemical plant will take up residence in the county. Community leaders are embracing it as a harbinger of the area's return to industrial glory. It will take patience and a deep compromise: the Shell plant's construction is years away, and it will employ 225 workers compared to Horsehead's 700 employees, 500 of whom have union jobs. For bigger companies, reshoring is less of a tsunami than a small wave. Despite the impressive corporate names bragging about bringing their manufacturing operations back to the US, the scale has in reality been too small to make a real difference. The number of companies who have actually reshored jobs to the US is well below one hundred. The public relations benefits, however, are undeniable. \"What these companies are doing is essentially image-building,\" says professor Richard B Freedman, co-director of the Labor and Worklife Program at the Harvard Law School. \"It might also be that they would like to have some leverage in local politics by setting up these plants.\" That is why, among industry experts and executives alike, optimism is scarce that more companies will follow suit in reshoring American manufacturing jobs. The truth is that the center of gravity for many international manufacturing companies has long ago scattered from a single base in the US to a global melange of places with cheap labor and lower taxes. Many companies are hedging their bets. \"Some new factories are being set up to be close to consumer markets but I don't see a large trend in these companies returning to US shores,\" says Freedman. \"While these companies were setting up plants in US, they were also opening new plants elsewhere.\" While General Electric, for instance, added 10,000 jobs and set up new plants in the US in 2011, the company also erected new factories in China, India, and a number of other places. \"The global environment for manufacturing is changing in a way where we must innovate differently,\" says Sebastian Duchamp, a GE spokesman. 'Today, innovation has to be in the markets you play in, close to your customers; and close to access the best talent wherever it exists in the world.\" GE, like other companies, is responding to the trend of what's called \"mass customization\", or making products to an individual customer's preferences. As a result, companies are finding it more suitable to have plants closer to their markets and to their research &amp; development units. For the US economy to become a hub of manufacturing once again, it needs more than just a few of its most famous companies returning to its shores. The National Association of Manufacturers, in a study carried out in 2010, argued that if the US is able to restructure corporate taxes, make tax credits on research &amp; development permanent, and modernize US export controls, then it would be able to add a significant number of jobs to the manufacturing sector. One strain of thinking holds that the chief rival of the United States manufacturing sector is China. From 1991 to 2007, US imports from China grew by a staggering 1,156% \u2013 while, over the same period, the fraction of the US working population employed in manufacturing fell by a third. China accounts for 40% of US imports in luggage, toys and footwear, and 30% of apparel, textiles, furniture and electrical appliances. In 2000, average Chinese wages were 22 times lower than average US wages. Those who fear China's disruptive impact on US manufacturing believe Americans can take cheer from the fact that China's growth appears to be stumbling. Boston Consulting group reasoned that a more sophisticated Chinese economy has resulted in better-paid Chinese workers, which reduces the costs company can save by basing production there. At the same time, global fuel prices have tripled since 2000, making shipment of manufactured goods all the way from China an expensive exercise. That could make the United States a competitive alternative again for manufacturing, BCG argued. There is, however, a long way to go before China falls behind the US. There's still a significant difference between average US wages and Chinese wages remains significant. China's per capita annual income of $5,445, along with a quarter of its population still living in rural areas, contributes to cheap labor. And even if these jobs move away from China, they are more likely to end up in places like India, Bangladesh and Africa \u2013 where wages are even cheaper \u2013 than return to US shores. It's not just the Chinese who are perceived as a threat. It's a very real risk that robots are taking American jobs. New manufacturing plants in the US may translate into more jobs for robots than humans. Kathryn Harrigan, a professor at the Columbia Business School, says many companies relied for too long on cheap human labor instead of splashing out large amounts of money on automating their factories. \"Now that some of that competitive advantage has eroded and automation is even cheaper,\" Harrigan said. \"They are simply completing the transition that would have taken place earlier.\" Automated factories, however, require highly skilled workers, often with training in technology and computers. The US, with declining graduation rates, may not have a rich supply of such workers. \"If we want American kids to get those jobs, then we will have to restructure our education system,\" Harrigan said. Experts say that with structural changes in education and infrastructure, America can probably gain further competitive advantage and stay a leader in the industries of the future \u2013 biotechnology, nanotechnology, wind power, aerospace, next generation automobiles \u2013 especially in comparison to countries of similar economic stature. That will take time, however, and the White House, Congress and corporate community have not made much progress on that front. None of the possible solutions \u2013 from educational reform to infrastructure investment \u2013 will come in time to help the workers at the Horsehead plant. As John Jeffers, the Horsehead union boss, winds down his fight to secure the future of his colleagues, he is also thinking about his own future. So far, Jeffers finds the job offers coming his way to be disheartening. \"It doesn't feel like there are many jobs out there. In fact, all the jobs I have been offered so far have been worth $14 an hour instead of the $20 I was making at Horsehead,\" he says. He's considering going back to school to get a degree in computer technology. \"The job offers I'm getting are way worse than what I used to make at Horsehead,\" Jeffers says. \"I'll basically have to start all over again if I want to work at a manufacturing plant now. I'm thinking about going back to school. Maybe study computers. That might help me find different kind of work.\" \u2022 This article was updated on 1 August 2013 to correct figures given by the Boston Consulting Group.

Until then, thanks, and goodnight. GW The number of people out of work in France has hit a new record high, dampening optimism generated by this morning's PMI data*. France's jobless total rose by 14,900 in June to 3.279 million, a rise of 0.5%, the Labour Ministry reported. It means president Francois Hollande has yet to meet his pledge to get unemploment falling before the start of 2014. Reuters has more details: Though young people are the hardest hit by the jobs crisis, with 555,800 registered out of work in June, that number was down 0.3 percent from May, the labour ministry data showed. The jobs crisis has become one of the biggest headaches for the Socialist government, which says it is convinced the jobless rate will fall over at least two months before the end of the year despite fresh records being hit every month. While unemployment is a lagging indicator, Wednesday's data were still likely to dampen public spirits after Hollande and Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici have sought in recent days to drum up optimism over the economy, declaring the recession over. * - see 8.08am onwards for details of how France's private sector is moving closer to growth this month. Open Europe's sober take on today's PMI data is worth a read: European stock markets have closed at their highest level in eight weeks, boosted by strong corporate results here and America as well as today's upbeat PMI surveys. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets commented: Europe\u2019s markets caught an early bid today shrugging off a disappointing Chinese PMI number and taking the positives from better than expected European, French and German manufacturing and services PMI numbers for July, and a slew of better than expected company updates from companies like Kingfisher, ARM Holdings, Easyjet and Tate and Lyle. And here's the biggest risers and fallers in London: On the issue of the Greek labour pool, Kathimerini reported this morning that the Athens government needs to find another 5,500 staff to fill it, and meet its targets.... More here. Workers at Greek public hospitals, health centers, welfare structures and the ambulance service are taking part in a one-day strike today, leaving only a skeleton staff on duty. Unions also held a protest outside the Health ministry today, over the government's plans to transfer some staff to the new 'mobility pool'. That pool is a key part of the push to cut the state workforce -- the one 'prior action' that needs to be met before Greece unlocks its aid payment (see 4.03pm). Here's a couple of photos: Back to the eurozone crisis, and the Eurogroup of finance ministers has announced that Greece is one step away from unlocking its next aid tranche, worth \u20ac2.5bn. In a statement, Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem announced that the Greek government has satisfied all-but-one condition. It wasn't more specific, but it must be the target for public sector job cuts: Here's the full statement: The euro area Member States have been informed today by the Troika institutions that Greece has satisfactorily implemented the prior actions required for the release of the next disbursement under the financial assistance programme, except for one action whose adoption by the Greek Parliament needs to be completed by Thursday, 25 July. These prior actions included important steps in the areas of fiscal policy, tax reform, revenue administration, public administration reform, privatisation and financial sector restructuring. Subject to confirmation of compliance with the last outstanding prior action, national procedures may thereafter be finalised and are expected to be completed by 29 July. Once this process has been satisfactorily concluded, the EFSF will be authorised to release the first sub-tranche of the next instalment, amounting to EUR 2.5 billion, according to the programme Sounds like UK readers should tune their televisions to ITV at 10pm tonight... Breaking news in the UK: Jane Austen is to appear on the next \u00a310 note. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has just announced that the author will grace the British tenner, from 2017. Here's the full story: Carney\u2019s announcement was aimed at quelling a three-month storm of protest unleashed when King announced that the only woman to appear on an English banknote other than the Queen \u2013 the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry \u2013 would be replaced by Winston Churchill, probably in 2016. She and Florence Nightingale are the only two women, other than the Queen, to have appeared on English banknotes since they started portraying historical figures in 1970. And here's the new concept note, showing what it will look like: I preferred our own version: Over in Germany, the entire former board of lender HSH Nordbank have gone on trial today in Hamburg. Six executives are accused of misconduct, or \"breach of fiduciary trust\", in the run-up to the financial crisis, through allegedly risky and dubious deals. This includes the bank's chief executive, Dirk Jens Nonnenmacher and his predecessor Hans Berger. Nonnenmacher and HSH's former capital markets chief, Jochen Friedrich, are also accused of accounting fraud, More details here. Speaking of America, this piece by Moira Herbst argues that income inequality and rising underemployment are holding back the world's largest economy: 10 reasons the US economy is stuck America's manufacturing sector is also picking up pace, although the labour market still remains weak. Markit's 'flash' estimate of US factory sector PMI came in at 53.2, up from June's 51.9. That's the strongest rise in activity in four months. New export orders, and new work generally, both rose, with total output across the sector posting its highest growth since March. But while firms hired more workers, the rate of job creation is still lower than earlier this year. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson explained that America's manufacturing sector isn't strong enough, yet, for the US Federal Reserve to start the process of slowing its stimulus package. He said: The pace of manufacturing growth remains well below that seen at the start of the year, in part reflecting weaker demand from many export markets, notably China and other emerging economies. Employment growth is disappointingly weak as a result, as firm focus on cost-cutting to boost competitiveness. The Fed will therefore be encouraged by signs that the sector is showing signs of reviving, but will no doubt remain cautious with regard to the longer-term outlook for the economy and the job market. It is likely that policymakers will generally need to see growth strengthen further before sounding more confident about the ability of the economy to withstand any tapering of stimulus. Marketwatch's Sara Sj\u00f6lin is pretty upbeat about today's PMI data, writing: Basically, the region has started to grow, and instead of seeing the area mired in recession, there\u2019s a decent chance it will emerge from the red numbers in the third quarter of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s probably fair to say we\u2019ve turned a corner. We are expecting things to improve and the PMIs confirm that,\u201d said James Ashley, senior European economist at RBC Capital Markets. Another boost for France \u2013 EU regulators are poised to approve a state loan to Peugeot. Reuters has the story: European Union regulators will approve next week a \u20ac7bn French state aid loan guarantee for PSA Peugeot Citroen's financing arm aimed at ensuring the French carmaker's viability, a European Commission source said on Wednesday. The Commission, which enforces state-aid rules in the 28-country European Union, opened an investigation into the case in May to decide whether the measure distorts competition. A Commission source said the EU competition authority will clear the guarantee after examining concessions offered by Peugeot. \"The discussion was about the conditions that could allow the Commission to approve such a guarantee under EU state aid rules, that is, on the restructuring plan, not on the amount of the guarantee itself,\" the source said. Facing falling sales and rising losses, Peugeot is trying to cut its domestic workforce by around one-sixth over the next two years, part of a \u20ac1.5bn restructuring plan. Martin Van Vliet, an economist at ING, predicts a \"slow and uneven\" return to growth in the eurozone. Like Larry Elliott (12.54pm) and Howard Archer (10.01am) Van Vliet sees several obstacles: \"Fiscal policy will remain a drag on growth, especially in the periphery. High unemployment and still-weakening housing markets will also help keep domestic demand in many euro-zone countries subdued. Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party is refusing to swallow the ban on its free food giveaway (see 11.42am), reports Kathimerini: Far right Golden Dawn on Wednesday announced that it was moving a free food handout scheduled to take place on the same day to another location after police announced a ban on any kind of public gathering in central Athens, froon noon to midnight. Today's encouraging eurozone data (9.09am) should not distract from the need for more efforts to nurture growth in the region, writes economics editor Larry Elliott: The good news is that Wednesday's report was no flash in the pan: the eurozone PMIs have been improving for the past five months. It is also encouraging that the pace of job shedding is easing, given that record unemployment has been a significant drag on activity. That said, it's far too early to start celebrating. The PMIs have signalled many a false dawn in the past and even now are a long way from signalling that a period of solid growth has resumed. What's more, the eurozone faces plenty of headwinds. Austerity programmes \u2013 despite being less severe \u2013 will continue to be a drag on growth; the latest figures for bank lending suggest that businesses are still struggling to get access to finance; and consumer spending will be held back by unemployment in excess of 12% and falling house prices. More here: Is an end to Europe's misery in sight? In the City, there's much excitement as drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline releases its financial results, as the storm over bribery allegations in China rolls on. GSK has reported a 2% rise in revenues, including a 14% incease in sales in China, but warned investors that that its business there will suffer from the current investigation - which has seen several Chinese executives arrested in recent days. My colleague Rupert Neate is live-blogging the GSK results and conference call here: GSK's China crisis: chief executive Andrew Witty speaks - live Witty has already described the allegations as \"shameful\" and \"deeply disappointing\". Sticking with Greece, the mayor of Athens has challenged the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party by forbidding its members from distributing free food on Friday. Athens mayor Giorgos Kaminis blocked Golden Dawn's plans for a distribution on Friday afternoon, saying the event \"consciously promotes racism and xenophobia.\u201d The food giveaways are a key part of Golden Dawn's strategy to grow its popularity among Greeks struggling to feed themselves as its economic crisis continues. The party which campaigns to throw immigrants out of Greece, is currently in third place in political polls. Athens police have now announced that any gatherings in Attiki Square are banned on Friday. Back in May, Kaminis blocked Golden Dawn from giving away food in Syntagma Square, site of the Athens parliament. Kathimerini reports that Golden Dawn isn't happy about the latest ban: Golden Dawn insisted that its plans for a handout were \u201c100 percent legal\u201d as it had informed authorities and that it would go ahead with the event. The party said that all its MPs and leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, would be at the event. The rise of Golden Dawn, with its swastika-esque logo, military-style training and extremist views, has caused alarm across Europe. The party's popularity has increased as Greece's economic crisis has worsened. Two weeks ago the Greek mnister for Public Order, Nikos Dendias, said he was \"very worried\" about the party. Meanwhile, the editor of the Spectator has defended his magazine over an article published by its columist Taki, in which he defended Golden Dawn. He argued: GD became very popular with certain poor Greeks while it defended them from being mugged by Albanian criminals and drug dealers, and for safeguarding older folk after bank withdrawals. No, Golden Dawn is not house-trained, and many of its members tend to use rough language and get physical.... Golden Dawn members are mostly labourers, martial artists, cops, security personnel and good old-fashioned patriotic Greeks. If you find that hard to believe (or stomach) here's the proof: Taki: A fascist takeover of Greece? We should be so lucky And here's some reaction: In Greece, medical staff are holding protests in the city of Thassaloniki against plans to cut health spending. University lecturer Spyros Gkelis tweets a photo: European stock markets are also ralling on the back of today's encouraging PMI data. Strong corporate results from firms such as EasyJet (details here) have also helped push the FTSE 100 up 44 points to 6641, a gain of 0.6%. Germany's DAX is up 0.5% while the French CAC has put on 0.7%). From the City Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, explains: After another record close for US equity markets last night equity indices have again opened on the front foot this morning, pushed on by better than expected PMI data from Europe and a string of strong earnings from blue chip firms. EasyJet, ARM, Tate &amp; Lyle, Kingfisher, GlaxoSmithKline and Compass have all provided updates this morning, and all occupy spots in the top 10 of the FTSE100 performance charts. Howard Archer, European economist at IHS Global Insight, agrees that today's data shows that the eurozone has finally stopped contracting: We suspect that Eurozone GDP was essentially flat in the second quarter amid improved German growth and reduced contraction in Italy and Spain. The BBC's Gavin Hewitt is also encouraged, but points out that unemployment is still increasing (although at a lower rate). You can download today's eurozone data here from Markit (pdf). A quick reminder -- today's improvement in the eurozone PMI data was driven by Germany's private sector growing at a five-month high (see 8.35am for details), and France's private firms shrinking at their softest pace in 17 months (see 8.08am onwards). We'll have to wait until the end of July for full country-by-country details.... Here's a graph of recent PMI data versus eurozone economic output. It explains why today's recovery in private sector output in the euro area means the recession may end this autumn: As explained at 9.09am, Markit's composite PMI rose to an 18-month high of 50.4 - meaning growth for the first time since the early days of 2012. The data showed a small contraction in the service sector, at 49.6 from 48.3. That was also an 18-month high. Europe's factories are doing better in July, with the manufacturing PMI hitting a 24-month high of 50.1 from 48.8 in June. OK, that's only a marginal expansion, as World First's Jeremy Cook points out: But it's better than losing a fingernail.... It's official. The eurozone's private sector is healing, and the end of the recession that has haunted the euro area for more than a year may soon be over. Markit's composite PMI output index, based on data from thousands of companies across the region, has hit its highest level in 18 months. It rose to 50.4, up from 48.7 in June, driven by improved performances from private sector companies in France and Germany. This is the first time it's broken above the 50.0 no-change level since January 2012. Markit reported that new orders only fell marginally, and job losses eased, Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the data suggests the eurozone could start growing again soon: The best PMI reading for one-and-a-half years provides encouraging evidence to suggest that the euro area could \u2013 at long last \u2013 pull out of its recession in the third quarter. The revival is being led by a broad-based upturn in manufacturing, where growth surged to a two-year high. Increased goods production was reported in Germany, France and across the rest of the region as a whole. There are also promising signs of stabilisation in the service sector, which hints at some much\u2013needed upturns in domestic demand. Rising service sector activity in Germany is being accompanied by slower rates of decline in France and elsewhere across the region. Employment continues to fall, but even on the jobs front there is welcome news in that companies are cutting back on headcounts to a lesser extent than earlier in the year. The survey data will therefore provide a summer fillip to policymakers, especially in terms of there being light at the end of the tunnel for austerity-hit periphery countries where political and social tensions have risen. The ECB in particular will be feeling much more confident in its expectation of the region returning to growth by the end of the year. Details and reaction to follow The euro just hit a 1-month high of $1.3249 against the US dollar, following today's PMI data from Germany and France. More reaction to this morning's upbeat data from France and Germany, and downbeat news from China: Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said Germany\u2019s private sector had shaken off its recent malaise in July to post its fastest pace of output expansion for five months (see 8.35am) The return to new business growth sets a positive tone at the start of the third quarter and a rebound in employment numbers adds to the air of positivity in the latest figures. The stronger performance of the German private sector in July appears to have been driven by improvements in domestic business and consumer spending. In particular, manufacturers cited higher demand patterns from the autos industry and among clients in the domestic construction sector, which helped offset continued weakness in key export markets. Germany's private sector has posted its strongest output in five months, suggesting Europe's largest economy may be strengthening this summer. Markit just reported that the \"Flash Germany PMI\" rose to 52.8, from June's 50.4, The strongest reading since February this year. Germany's factory sector returned to growth, clawing over the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. Manufacturing PMI came in at 50.3, much better than June's 48.6. And Germany's service sector PMI jumped to 52.5, from 50.4. Encouraging stuff. Details to folllow.... Today's improved French PMI data comes a day after finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, declared that the country's recession was over. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, said there are signs that the French private sector is close to a recovery, and could return to growth this year: Output in the French private sector moved closer to stabilisation at the start of the third quarter. Manufacturers actually signalled a rise in output for the first time in almost one-and-a-half years, while service providers registered a slower decline in activity. Encouraging data from France -- where private sector output has fallen at its slowest rate in 17 months. Markit, the data provider, reported that the French private sector PMI has risen to 48.8 this month, up from June's 47.4. That's a 17-month high, and suggests the private sector only shrank marginally. France's manufacturing sector came close to posting growth, with a PMI of 49.8 (up from 48.4 in June). That's also a 17-month high. And the service sector also did better, at 48.2 from 47.2. Markir reported signs of optimism in the eurozone's second-largest economy: Service providers indicated a slower fall in outstanding business, while manufacturers reported a rise for the first time since April 2012. The rate of job shedding in the French private sector moderated further in July. The latest fall in staffing levels was the slowest in 15 months. Both service providers and manufacturers signalled weaker reductions in employment. Here's the full report. And here's some instant reaction from City experts on Twitter: Portugal's new cabinet will be sworn in at 5pm BST today, at the end of a dramatic three weeks. Junior coalition partner Paulo Portas becomes deputy prime minister, cementing his new, more powerful position after his (now-reversed resignation): European reporter Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardo has the details, and reports that the country's new economy minister is keen to make changes to Portugal's austerity programme. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events around the eurozone, the global economy and the financial markets. A big morning for economic data has already begun with some disappointing news from China. Manufacturing activity in the world's second-largest economy has shrunk to its lowest level since last August. New orders and output both shrank in July, while the jobs market also declined, according to the 'Flash' estimate released by HSBC in the early hours. The flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index fell for a third straight month, to 47.7, from June's final reading of 48.2. A reading between 50 indicates that activity fell. As Hongbin Qu, chief China economist of HSBC, explained: The lower reading of the July HSBC Flash China Manufacturing PMI suggests a continuous slowdown in manufacturing sectors thanks to weaker new orders and faster destocking. This adds more pressure on the labour market. It also puts Chinese premier Li's promise yesterday to keep growth at 7% or higher under the microscope. Further stimulus measures could be needed, especially with Beijing banning anyone building a new government building until 2018. But closer to home, how are Europe's manufacturing and service sectors performing this month? We'll find out in the next few hours, with 'flash' readings from several countries including France (8am BST) and Germany (8.30am BST), followed by the full reading for the eurozone at 9am BST. Also coming up.... Portugal's new government is being sworn in (details to follow), and medical staff in Greece will be holding a strike against proposed job cuts. I'll also be watching for updates on the status of the next Greek aid payment, following last night's news that it may be delayed. if you missed that news, Marketwatch sums up the situation: The European Commission notified Berlin Tuesday that it can\u2019t vouch yet that Greece has fulfilled all the conditions to receive its next slice of bailout loans, Germany\u2019s deputy finance minister said in a letter to the German parliament. The decision means the next tranche of aid for Greece will likely be delayed, but there should not be any \u201cserious\u201d problem with the payment, one person familiar with the situation said. Full story: Germany says payment of Greek aid may be delayed I\"ll be tracking all the latest developments through the day as usual...",

Increased goods production was reported in Germany, France and across the rest of the region as a whole.</p> <p>There are also promising signs of stabilisation in the service sector, which hints at some much\u2013needed upturns in domestic demand. Rising service sector activity in Germany is being accompanied by slower rates of decline in France and elsewhere across the region.</p> <p>Employment continues to fall, but even on the jobs front there is welcome news in that companies are cutting back on headcounts to a lesser extent than earlier in the year.</p> <p>The survey data will therefore provide a summer fillip to policymakers, especially in terms of there being light at the end of the tunnel for austerity-hit periphery countries where political and social tensions have risen.</p> <p>The ECB in particular will be feeling much more confident in its expectation of the region returning to growth by the end of the year.</p> </blockquote> <p><em><strong>Details and reaction to follow</strong></em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-07-24T08:25:41.624Z\">at 9.25am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51ef8968e4b0d7e64793714c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-24T07:59:36.387Z\">8.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The euro just hit a 1-month high of $1.3249 against the US dollar, following today's PMI data from Germany and France.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51ef8669e4b00069b47bc0c4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-24T07:46:49.398Z\">8.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/statuses/359942475282006016\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Much better composite <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PMI&amp;src=hash\">#PMI</a> numbers from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23France&amp;src=hash\">#France</a> today but at 48.8 they still signal a moderate rate of contraction. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Business&amp;src=hash\">#Business</a></p>&mdash; Shaun Richards (@notayesmansecon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/statuses/359942475282006016\">July 24, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51ef8604e4b00069b47bc0c3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-24T07:45:08.897Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Early reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More reaction to this morning's upbeat data from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jul/24/eurozone-crisis-manufacturing-pmi-china-europe#block-51ef7c1be4b0d7e647937148\">France</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jul/24/eurozone-crisis-manufacturing-pmi-china-europe#block-51ef83dde4b0d77fe6436704\">Germany</a>, and downbeat news from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jul/24/eurozone-crisis-manufacturing-pmi-china-europe#block-51ef713fe4b0d7e647937147\">China</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/statuses/359939900591718401\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>European recession is either over, or almost over.</p>&mdash; Joseph Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/statuses/359939900591718401\">July 24, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AcrossTheCurve/statuses/359940160533692416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart\">@TheStalwart</a> if we learned anything from the &quot;Great Recession&quot; its that it will take years for Europe to recover</p>&mdash; AgainstTheGrain (@AcrossTheCurve) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AcrossTheCurve/statuses/359940160533692416\">July 24, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/fwred/statuses/359940108834709505\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Wait, with the eurozone about to exit recession, the next move by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ECB&amp;src=hash\">#ECB</a> should be a rate hike, right?

Manufacturing activity in the world's second-largest economy has shrunk to its lowest level since last August.</p> <p>New orders and output both shrank in July, while the jobs market also declined, according to the 'Flash' estimate released by HSBC in the early hours.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.hsbc.com/news-and-insight/2013/flash-pmi-at-11-month-low\">The flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index</a> fell for a third straight month, to 47.7, from June's final reading of 48.2. A reading between 50 indicates that activity fell.</strong></p> <p>As <strong>Hongbin Qu</strong>, chief China economist of <strong>HSBC</strong>, explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The lower reading of the July HSBC Flash China Manufacturing PMI suggests a continuous slowdown in manufacturing sectors thanks to weaker new orders and faster destocking.</p> <p>This adds more pressure on the labour market.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also puts Chinese premier Li's promise yesterday to keep growth at 7% or higher under the microscope. Further stimulus measures could be needed, especially with <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/352ea1a6-f40d-11e2-942f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2ZmxPdOCW\">Beijing banning anyone building a new government building until 2018</a>.</p> <p><strong>But closer to home, how are Europe's manufacturing and service sectors performing this month?</strong></p> <p>We'll find out in the next few hours, with 'flash' readings from several countries including France (8am BST) and Germany (8.30am BST), followed by the full reading for the eurozone at 9am BST.</p> <p>Also coming up.... Portugal's new government is being sworn in (<em>details to follow</em>), and medical staff in Greece will be holding a strike against proposed job cuts.</p> <p><strong> I'll also be watching for updates on the status of the next Greek aid payment, following last night's news that it may be delayed</strong>. if you missed that news, Marketwatch sums up the situation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The European Commission notified Berlin Tuesday that it can\u2019t vouch yet that Greece has fulfilled all the conditions to receive its next slice of bailout loans, Germany\u2019s deputy finance minister said in a letter to the German parliament.</p> <p>The decision means the next tranche of aid for Greece will likely be delayed, but there should not be any \u201cserious\u201d problem with the payment, one person familiar with the situation said.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Full story: <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/germany-says-payment-of-greek-aid-may-be-delayed-2013-07-23\">Germany says payment of Greek aid may be delayed</a></strong></p> <p>I\"ll be tracking all the latest developments through the day as usual...</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-07-24T07:03:26.782Z\">at 8.03am BST</time></p>  </div>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jane Austen has been confirmed as the next face of the \u00a310 note in a victory for campaigners demanding female representation \u2013 aside from the Queen \u2013 on the country's cash. Sir Mervyn King, the Bank's former governor, had let slip to MPs that the author of Pride and Prejudice was \"waiting in the wings\" as a potential candidate to feature on a banknote, and his successor, Mark Carney, confirmed on Wednesday that she would feature, probably from 2017. \"Jane Austen certainly merits a place in the select group of historical figures to appear on our banknotes. Her novels have an enduring and universal appeal and she is recognised as one of the greatest writers in English literature,\" the new governor said. He also announced that the Bank would carry out a review of the process for selecting the historical figures who appear on banknotes, to ensure that a diverse range of figures is represented. \"We believe that our notes should celebrate the full diversity of great British historical figures and their contributions in a wide range of fields. The Bank is committed to that objective, and we want people to have confidence in our commitment to diversity. That is why I am today announcing a review of the selection process for future banknote characters,\" Carney said. The review will be overseen by the chief cashier Chris Salmon, whose signature appears on banknotes. Carney's announcement was aimed at quelling a three-month storm of protest unleashed when King announced that the only woman to appear on an English banknote other than the Queen \u2013 the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry \u2013 would be replaced by Winston Churchill, probably in 2016. She and Florence Nightingale are the only two women, other than the Queen, to have appeared on English banknotes since they started portraying historical figures in 1970. Campaigners threatened to take the Bank to court for discrimination under the 2010 Equality Act and launched a petition on the campaign site Change.org which secured more than 35,000 signatures. Caroline Criado-Perez, co-founder of feminist blog the Women's Room, who led the campaign, and was called in to discuss the issue with Salmon, said the Bank's announcement marked a \"brilliant day for women\". \"Without this campaign, without the 35,000 people who signed our Change.org petition, the Bank of England would have unthinkingly airbrushed women out of history. We warmly welcome this move from the Bank and thank them for listening to us and taking such positive and emphatic steps to address our concerns,\" she said. \"To hear Jane Austen confirmed is fantastic, but to hear the process will be comprehensively reviewed is even better.\" Campaigners said that the \u00a313,000 raised to challenge the Bank's banknote decision in court would now go to women's charities, including Rape Crisis. Austen will take her place on the \u00a310 note in 2017, the bicentenary of her death, replacing the 19th-century naturalist Charles Darwin, who has been on the notes since late 2000. Criado-Perez conceded Austen was not top of her wish-list as the next woman on a bank note but that she was a particularly apt choice given the context. \"She was an incredibly intelligent woman. She spent her time poking fun at the establishment. All her books are about how women are trapped and misrepresented. It is really sad that she was saying that 200 years ago and I am still having to say that today,\" the campaigner said. Stella Creasy MP, who helped organise a letter from 46 Labour MPs to David Cameron in support of the campaign, said: \"Britain has many women in its history of whom we should be proud, and today's decision is part of creating a culture of expectation that there will be many more in our future too.\" Under the current process, members of the public put forward suggestions on who should appear on banknotes, although the Bank only considers figures who have made an \"indisputable contribution to their particular field of work\". It takes into account the list of public suggestions, but the governor of the Bank has the final decision. As well as a portrait of Austen, the new note will include images of her writing desk and quills at Chawton Cottage, in Hampshire, where she lived; her brother's home, Godmersham Park, which she visited often, and is thought to have inspired some of her novels, and a quote from Miss Bingley, in Pride and Prejudice: \"I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!\"",

      "bodyText": "Everything Everywhere has signed a total of 687,000 customers to its 4G mobile network nine months after launch, as smartphone owners chase faster mobile internet connections. With Vodafone, 3 and O2 yet to bring their own flavours of 4G to market, EE is racing to make the most of its monopoly. Reporting half year financial results on Wednesday, the company said the rate of adoption for its new service had doubled in the June quarter compared with the previous five months, and that it is on track to more than reach its target of 1 million users by Christmas. The group is now signing more than 120,000 contracts a month for 4G connections , compared with an average of 60,000 a month earlier in the year. The growth has come despite a higher price tag \u2013 EE's 4G service costs between \u00a35 and \u00a310 more a month than a typical 3G contract. \"EE's figures indicate considerable willingness among UK users to pay extra for high-performance mobile broadband,\" said IDC analyst John Delaney. \"This bodes well for the prospects of the other UK operators when they bring 4G services to market.\" Launched last autumn, the 4G network now reaches 95 UK towns and cities and nearly 60% of the population. It will reach 98% by the end of 2014. This summer, EE doubled average speeds to between 24 and 30 Megabits per second in 15 of the largest cities. Finance director Neal Milsom dismissed suggestions that the arrival of competing 4G services this autumn will lead to a price war and lower costs for consumers. \"All of us are spending a lot of money to upgrade our networks and on buying spectrum,\" he said. \"It's quite a bizarre business decision if you trash the price on launching it.\" Profitability has increased to a record high for EE, which was formed in 2010 through the merger of Orange and T-Mobile. Underlying earnings of \u00a3734m are now nearly 23% of revenue, thanks to cost savings achieved by combining the Orange and T-Mobile mast networks and a reduction in the number of shops. The company's retail estate has shrunk by 130 stores to around 600. EE, which is owned by Deutsche Telekom and Orange, the German and French national phone companies, will pay its parents a \u00a3159m dividend for the half year. Total customer numbers fell year on year from 28.2 million to 27.5 million, with the number of pre-pay customers declining across the mobile industry in the UK. The customer count now includes not just mobile phone connections, but 1.5 million machines with connections to EE's mobile networks such as utility smart meters, black boxes installed in cars by insurers, and even clothing to monitor individuals with dementia. Chief executive Olaf Swantee said EE would \"exceed\" its 1 million 4G customer target by the end of the year. With 4G customers on average five years younger than the typical mobile phone owner, Swantee said take up rates would rise in September as students head back to university for the new term.",

Did this inflate the price of GSK's drugs to patients?</strong></p> <p><em>He did not answer this question.

      "bodyText": "Witty ended the conference call before allowing me to put the Guardian's eight questions to him. I have collated the best we learned from his other answers. What have GSK staff actually done? \"It [the Chinese investigation] appears to be focused on a number of senior managers, potentially defrauding GSK and doing something inappropriate and illegal.\" He said the allegations were \"shameful\" and \"deeply disappointing\". \"To be crystal clear we have zero tolerance to this sort of behaviour,\" he said. But he refused to explain what exactly the executives have been doing. He said the investigation was in the early stages, and he was unable to provide any further details. How long have GSK China executives been allegedly breaking the law? Witty did not answer this question. How much did GSK pay out in bribes? Did this inflate the price of GSK's drugs to patients? He did not answer this question. But he raised the possibility of discounting the price of drugs in China. When did GSK first become aware of these allegations and why did Witty not address accusations of wrongdoing in China earlier? Witty said GSK's head office in London \"knew nothing\" of the fraud allegations until they were announced by the Chinese police last week. He stressed that the current investigation is \"quite different\" to a whistleblower's claims of corruption GSK investigated recently and said it found \"no evidence of corruption or bribery in our China business\". He did not explain why the previous four-month internal investigation did not discover the current allegations. How far up the corporate food chain did the corruption reach? Witty said the Chinese police's investigation appeared to focus on the four Chinese GSK executives already detained, and he said there was nothing to indicate that GSK China's British management - Mark Reilly and Steve Nechelput - had any knowledge of the wrongdoings. What will Witty do to clean up GSK's Chinese operations? Witty said GSK is \"cooperating fully with the authorities\" and was absolutely committed to rooting out corruption. He said GSK would carry out a full review of its Chinese operations and processes. He said he was \"absolutely willing and ready\" to go to China, but said he has no plans to go yet. What information has GSK passed to the Serious Fraud Office? He did not state what information has been exchanged. But said GSK has \"opened up channels\" to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. And the company has also \"consulted with the UK government\". Can Witty assure shareholders that staff in other countries are not bribing doctors? He said he was \"personally very disappointed\" by the \"shameful allegations\", but said he remains \"strongly of the view that the 99.9% of individuals in this organisation are operating in the right way\". Despite a number of journalists still requesting to ask questions, Witty said he had \"run out of time\" after 30 minutes of questions and closed the conference call by repeating his \"absolute\" commitment to \"rooting out corruption\". Witty says GSK has \"opened up channels\" to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. He says the company has also \"consulted with the UK government\". Witty says he's \"absolutely willing and ready\" to go to China, but says there are a lot of other issues in GSK that require his attention. He declined to say if he would hand back some of his bonus this year if the company is found guilty of fraud in China. I am personally very disappointed. They are shameful allegations. I remain strongly of the view that the 99.9% of individuals in this organisation are operating in the right way. Witty says this investigation is \"quite different\" to the whistleblower claims the company recently investigated and found no evidence of wrongdoing. It [the Chinese investigation] appears to be focused on a number of senior managers, potentially defrauding GSK and doing something inappropriate and illegal Witty says there is nothing to indicate that the British management of GSK China had any role in the scandal or any knowledge of the activities of other individuals. Witty said the allegations are \"totally contrary to our values\", and says the company is \"cooperating fully with the authorities\". Witty said the allegations in China are \"shameful\" and \"deeply disappointing\". To be crystal clear we have zero tolerance to this sort of behaviour. GSK's sales in second quarter are up 2% to \u00a36.6bn. Earnings per share were up 1%. the company expects to sell Lucozade and Ribena before the end of the year. Witty's only comment on the China scandal in the company's half-year results is: Clearly, we are likely to see some impact to our performance in China as a result of the current investigation, but it is too early to quantify the extent of this. We are co-operating fully with the Chinese authorities in this matter. In the latest development China's official news agency has today hinted that more foreign and local drug companies could soon be implicated in the \"rampant\" bribery scandal. More on Reuters. It will not be surprising if more pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, domestic or international, are to be involved in probes in the days to come. Big international firms should shoulder (their) due responsibilities to bid farewell to malpractice, setting a good example and serving as a wake-up call for domestic pharmaceutical companies. What have GSK staff actually done? The Chinese authorities have accused GSK of acting like a criminal \"godfather\", using a network of 700 middlemen and travel agencies to bribe doctors with \u00a3320m cash and sexual favours in return for prescribing GSK drugs. How long have GSK China executives been allegedly breaking the law? Gao said the police have evidence that bribery has been a \"core part\" of GSK China's business model since 2007. How much did GSK pay out in bribes? Did this inflate the price of GSK's drugs to patients? Gao claims GSK spent 3bn yuan (\u00a3320m) on bribes. GSK has refused to comment. When did GSK first become aware of these allegations and why did Witty not address accusations of wrongdoing in China earlier? The Chinese authorities announced the charges and arrested the four GSK executives on 15 July \u2013 this was just a week after the company said a four-month internal investigation found \"no evidence of corruption or bribery in our China business\". How far up the corporate food chain did the corruption reach? GSK has refused to say how many of its executives appear to have breached Chinese laws, or name any individuals it suspects. What will Witty do to clean up GSK's Chinese operations? GSK said it is taking the charges \"extremely seriously\" and will take \"all necessary actions to \u2026 root out corruption wherever it exists\", but the company has not so far given any details of specific measures it will take. What information has GSK passed to the Serious Fraud Office? GSK said it is regularly briefing the SFO, but has not said what information it has passed on. Can Witty assure shareholders that staff in other countries are not bribing doctors? Last year GSK paid a $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) fine in the US to settle claims that it tricked and bribed doctors into prescribing dangerous antidepressants to children. After the settlement Witty vowed that a company-wide overhaul would prevent a repeat of the scandal. Britain's biggest drug company has admitted some of its executives have broken the law, but has failed to explain who did it, what they did, when they did it or how long the company has known about it.

Samuel Tombs, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the sector's recovery was gathering momentum, though at a slower pace than the services sector. \"This improvement brings the CBI's survey in line with the relatively upbeat tone of the other surveys. But with demand for exports weak in the UK's largest market, the eurozone, and domestic consumers' real pay still being squeezed, it is hard to see how the manufacturing sector's recovery can gather much more pace in the near term,\" he said. Stephen Gifford, the CBI's director of economics, said manufacturers had seen a pick-up in activity across the board, but agreed there was still a degree of nervousness around the boardroom tables of many firms. \"Optimism in the sector has risen again, and demand conditions are expected to improve further in the coming three months,\" he said. \"The gentle rise in confidence is being reflected in firms' headcount, which is rising at the fastest rate in a year. \"But manufacturers remain concerned about political and economic conditions abroad limiting export orders, which is likely to reflect heightened uncertainty over the global economic outlook.\"",

      "bodyText": "The latest news from the eurozone is as upbeat as it has been for 18 months. Snapshots of activity in the manufacturing and services sectors are consistent with the long recession in the single currency area \u2013 which has been entrenched for the past six quarters \u2013 coming to an end. If the evidence from purchasing managers is to be believed, Germany is looking good and France is clawing its way back to normality. A better performance by the eurozone's Big Two \u2013 accompanied by a lessening of recessionary pressure in Spain and Italy \u2013 should, with luck, eke out some growth across the region in the second half of 2013. Analysts put the recent improvement down to the growth stimulus provided by the European Central Bank, the slower pace of austerity in 2013 compared with 2012, and the help that last year's pickup in the global economy provided to Europe's export-dependent economy. So is this it? Are the PMIs (purchasing managers' indices) proof that an end to Europe's misery is at last in sight? The good news is that Wednesday's report was no flash in the pan: the eurozone PMIs have been improving for the past five months. It is also encouraging that the pace of job shedding is easing, given that record unemployment has been a significant drag on activity. That said, it's far too early to start celebrating. The PMIs have signalled many a false dawn in the past and even now are a long way from signalling that a period of solid growth has resumed. What's more, the eurozone faces plenty of headwinds. Austerity programmes \u2013 despite being less severe \u2013 will continue to be a drag on growth; the latest figures for bank lending suggest that businesses are still struggling to get access to finance; and consumer spending will be held back by unemployment in excess of 12% and falling house prices. As a result, the eurozone will need strong growth in the rest of the world economy if a recovery is to put down roots. Here, the news is not particularly encouraging. The US is growing modestly but the latest manufacturing PMI from China showed a fourth successive decline. Eurozone firms will find export markets challenging. The ECB may conclude from these PMIs that no further action is needed to boost eurozone growth. That, though, would be a mistake. Further setbacks are likely over the next 18 months and recovery \u2013 if it comes \u2013 will take careful nurturing.",

Those increased prices mean that, according to this example <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/petrol-price-rising-fast-and-likely-to-keep-going-20130722-2qevf.html\">borrowed from the Sydney Morning Herald</a>, filling up a 60 litre car once a week will now cost an extra $780 a year. That's a pretty sizeable extra chunk of change to be spending on getting around.</p> <p>So how does the petrol price increase affect commuters? Using as an example the most popular car in Australia, the Toyota Corolla, for a 74.5 km commute from Gosford to Sydney over a year you'd use 2,468.3 litres of petrol. At $1.55 a litre, you'd be paying $3,825.91 in fuel costs \u2013 up from the $3,208.83 you would have been paying when petrol was at $1.30 a litre.</p> <p>By contrast, a yearly train ticket for the same trip costs $2,400, so currently you'd be saving around $1,425.90 by taking the train. In addition, the NRMA has estimated that the running cost for a car per week (excluding petrol) ranges from $26 to $65 for the <a href=\"http://www.mynrma.com.au/motoring/buy-sell/buying-advice/car-operating-costs/top-10-cars.htm\">top 10 cars in various categories</a>.</p> <p>So is it worth abandoning your car? For the equivalent of the extra $780 your fuel will cost over a year, you could invest in a different form of transport.</p> <h2>Public transport</h2> <p>If you were commuting from Gosford to Sydney by train, you could get three monthly tickets for your $780 and still have money left over. On a Melbourne tram, you could get 117 days of travel in all zones using a myki pass. And if you live in a regional area \u2026 you probably don't have any public transport whatsoever, so please do skip ahead.</p> <h2>Segway</h2> <p>So, just like the <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-17912_3-9983589-72.html\">Chinese military</a> you're a connoisseur of motorised, gyroscopic scooters. Good on you! You could <a href=\"http://www.rentoid.com/item/Segwayi2-Sydney-7502\">hire a Segway for 3.5 days </a>and scoot around the place instead of spending money on petrol. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDXMZdZG3Bc\">Beware of cricket helmets</a>, the Segway's natural enemy.</p> <h2>Hoof it</h2> <p>You could get almost <a href=\"http://www.horsetreks.com.au/pricing.html\">three days of horse hire</a> for your $780, though I'm unsure how practical it would be for commuting. And if you're thinking the horse knows the way home from the pub so you can have a few beers and ride (I know I was), <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/why-horses-and-alcohol-dont-mix/story-e6freuy9-1111117498616\">then think again</a>. You may even be able to buy an entire donkey, with the <a href=\"http://www.donkeywa.org.au/donkey-society-frequently-asked-questions.html\">Donkey Society of Western Australia </a>estimating they cost between $500 and $1,000.</p> <h2>Cycle</h2> <p>You can easily get a decent bicycle for $780 or less. However, if you're looking for something different you could try a unicycle, tandem bicycle, or some other wheeled contraption. Penny Farthings are unfortunately <a href=\"http://www.hiwheel.com/antique_replicas/index.htm\">rather expensive</a>, so put your tweed jacket back in the cupboard.
