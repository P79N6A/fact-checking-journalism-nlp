      "bodyText": "The chairman of the London Stock Exchange, Donald Brydon, is expected to survive an audacious attempt by an activist investor to bring about an abrupt end to his two and a half years at the helm of the group. Brydon faces a vote this week on his future after a row with the Children\u2019s Investment Fund (TCI), which owns 5% of the exchange, over boardroom changes. It comes as the annual number of flotations on the LSE is expected to top 100 for the first time since 2014, in a sign that the UK is still attractive to firms despite the Brexit vote. This year\u2019s figure compares with 65 initial public offerings in 2016, and is higher than anywhere else in Europe. \u201cDespite the challenges Brexit presents, London\u2019s highly global, deep and liquid capital markets continue to be the ideal partner for funding the world\u2019s growth,\u201d said Nikhil Rathi, a senior executive at LSE. \u201cIt is particularly significant that the number of international listings in London is up, with North American listings up nearly sevenfold on last year.\u201d LSE will be keen to draw a line under its row with TCI, which has forced a shareholder meeting to be called after the exchange announced in October that its group chief executive, Xavier Rolet, 58, would leave next year. TCI, run by Sir Christopher Hohn, had wanted Rolet to stay and Brydon, 72, to go. An intervention by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, led to an accelerated departure date for Rolet and a pledge from Brydon to leave at the annual general meeting in 2019. But TCI has pressed ahead with its demand that Brydon leave sooner. Hohn, who is known for his activist stance, looks likely to lose his battle to oust Brydon. Two influential shareholder advisory bodies, ISS and Glass Lewis, have advised their clients to vote against TCI\u2019s resolution, the only item on the agenda at Tuesday\u2019s specially convened meeting. ISS said TCI had not proved its case that removing Brydon would be beneficial for the company, and looking for a chief executive and a chairman at the same time would not be ideal. Glass Lewis is not convinced either. It said it had found little evidence to support the claims that shareholders had lost faith in Brydon as chairman or that the company might face difficulty attracting quality chief executive candidates to serve under him. Other investors have come out against TCI, including Blackrock and Qatar Investment fund.",

    "webTitle": "The UK jobs engine isn\u2019t working any more", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Piece by piece, Britain\u2019s jobs-creating machine in the years of economic recovery since the financial crisis appears to be coming unstuck. Dating back to early 2012, the number of people in employment has been on an upward curve \u2013 to fanfare from the Conservatives, who readily quote the 3 million jobs created since they came to power in 2010. But Theresa May should be worried, after figures from the Office for National Statistics last week showed the jobs engine has now chugged into reverse. The number of people in work across Britain fell by 56,000 during the three months to October to stand at just over 32 million \u2013 the steepest drop since mid-2015. It also followed a smaller fall of 14,000 in the three months to September. Although the UK still has an employment rate much higher than some of its major European peers, at about 75%, the gradual breakdown of Britain\u2019s jobs machine is worrying as it comes at a time of sluggish wages, slowing economic growth, rising inflation and political uncertainty amid talks with Brussels to leave the EU. Economists have argued a slowing economy and the political maelstrom around Brexit will make firms reluctant to hire workers. Paying to take on more staff just as your business slows \u2013 in Europe, as a result of potential trade barriers, and at home, as rising inflation erodes the spending power of consumers \u2013 doesn\u2019t add up. But there\u2019s another potential spanner in the works. The economist John Philpott reckons the decline comes as a result of weakness in the supply of employable people, as opposed to an outright drop in demand among firms to take on new staff. That\u2019s borne out by the number of vacancies: 798,000 \u2013 the highest level since comparable records began in 2001. One of the main reasons here was the falling numbers of people arriving for work from central and eastern Europe since the EU referendum, he added. That should be worrying for the road ahead \u2013 putting greater emphasis on ministers to increase spending on skills and training to boost the domestic workforce. Lobby groups, including the British Chambers of Commerce, are already warning that shortages of skilled workers will damage growth. Despite the fall in employment, the proportion of people out of work has remained at the lowest levels since the mid-1970s. There were 1.43 million people out of work \u2013 with the unemployment rate standing at 4.3%. However, this record low for unemployment is failing to boost the pay of workers, despite expectations among economists for greater levels of bargaining power to ask for a pay rise, leading to higher wages. Average weekly earnings increased at a rate of 2.3%, according to the latest figures. That should worry the Bank of England, which kept interest rates on hold on Thursday but said it was still considering raising the cost of borrowing after the first increase in a decade last month. Threadneedle Street has been watching closely for higher wages to justify its actions, although pay growth still appears to be sluggish. Inflation figures last week also show prices are rising at a faster pace than wages \u2013 at 3.1%, eating away at household incomes \u2013 driven by the weak pound pushing up the cost of imported goods since the referendum. The Resolution Foundation thinktank reckons average annual pay, when taking account of inflation, may not return to its pre-financial crisis peak until at least 2025. There are worrying implications for poverty and inequality. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates 3.7 million people with a job do not earn enough to meet minimum needs, and that low wage growth and rising inflation will make it harder for them to escape poverty. As well as the social and political ramifications, this sounds another alarm over the future health of the economy, as dwindling household incomes make it harder for a family to keep on buying goods and services \u2013 one of the key drivers for growth.Britain\u2019s jobs machine needs fixing fast. Ryanair chief can afford to indulge in Christmas spirit As Groucho Marx famously said: \u201cThose are my principles, and if you don\u2019t like them, well, I have others.\u201d After 30 years of deriding unions and occasionally insulting his pilots, Ryanair chief Michael O\u2019Leary has made a dramatic volte face. As if visited by some Dickensian nocturnal spectre, just three days after vowing to face down pilots, O\u2019Leary said Ryanair would instead recognise their unions to avert a strike. The abrasive billionaire has form for Damascene conversions \u2013 just four years ago, the concept of being \u201cnice\u201d to passengers infiltrated company policy, after decades of punitive charges and pantomimish outbursts against complainers. Had he known how good niceness was for business, O\u2019Leary has remarked since, he would have started years earlier. A shift on unions will similarly stem from business necessity, rather than any late-flowering Corbynism, and reps are right to read the offer with scepticism. Pilots have picked their moment to strike, with Ryanair having ordered an abundance of planes at a time when there\u2019s a shortage of people to fly them. Yet this Ryanair concession, like its changed attitude to customers, is ultimately testament to the airline\u2019s strength, rather than weakness. The kind of practices that ruthlessly kept costs down through its growth as an upstart airline can no longer sustain a market leader in countries across Europe. It is not challenger but incumbent: a profit-spewing giant, whose scale and unit costs are low enough to afford to invest in contented staff, rather than alienated contractors. Having cancelled a wave of flights this winter, Ryanair was already expecting to fork out for significant pay rises to attract and retain pilots. The airline may yet find a discount in respecting their rights, and maintaining separate negotiations across 33 countries\u2019 unions, rather than a pan-European network that was evolving. O\u2019Leary said it was a moment of radical change. If so, it is to be applauded \u2013 but the test of principle will be if the same olive branch is extended to its ill-served cabin crew, who have even this month been warned of collective sanctions should any individual join a strike. Persimmon need to rebuild board\u2019s image There is corporate excess and then there is the Persimmon bonus scheme. It is astonishing, nearly a decade on from the nadir of the credit crunch, that a FTSE business is paying out \u00a3500m to 150 executives. Top of the pile is chief executive Jeff Fairburn, who between now and New Year\u2019s Eve \u2013 when the bonuses start paying out \u2013 has the chance to declare that he will donate some of the money to charity. His chair, Nicholas Wrigley, who resigned over the scheme, is said to have put pressure on his chief executive to make a donation to charity. Fairburn needs to do the right thing for himself and the reputation of British business.",

      "body": "<p>Piece by piece, Britain\u2019s jobs-creating machine in the years of economic recovery since the financial crisis appears to be coming unstuck.</p> <p>Dating back to early 2012, the number of people in employment has been on an upward curve \u2013 to fanfare from the Conservatives, who readily quote the 3 million jobs created since they came to power in 2010. But Theresa May should be worried, after figures from the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/december2017\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics</a> last week showed the jobs engine has now chugged into reverse.</p> <p>The number of people in work across Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/13/fall-in-employment-rate-spells-end-of-uk-jobs-boom\" title=\"\">fell by 56,000 during the three months to October to stand at just over 32 million</a> \u2013 the steepest drop since mid-2015. It also followed a smaller fall of 14,000 in the three months to September.</p> <p>Although the UK still has an employment rate much higher than some of its major European peers, at about 75%, the gradual breakdown of Britain\u2019s jobs machine is worrying as it comes at a time of sluggish wages, slowing economic growth, rising inflation and political uncertainty amid talks with Brussels to leave the EU.</p> <p>Economists have argued a slowing economy and the political maelstrom around Brexit will make firms reluctant to hire workers. Paying to take on more staff just as your business slows \u2013 in Europe, as a result of potential trade barriers, and at home, as rising inflation erodes the spending power of consumers \u2013 doesn\u2019t add up.</p> <p>But there\u2019s another potential spanner in the works. The economist John Philpott reckons the decline comes as a result of weakness in the supply of employable people, as opposed to an outright drop in demand among firms to take on new staff. That\u2019s borne out by the number of vacancies: 798,000 \u2013 the highest level since comparable records began in 2001. One of the main reasons here was the falling numbers of people arriving for work from central and eastern Europe since the EU referendum, he added.</p> <p>That should be worrying for the road ahead \u2013 putting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/18/apprenticeships-budget-hammond-skills-shortages-brexit\" title=\"\">greater emphasis on ministers to increase spending on skills and training to boost the domestic workforce</a>. Lobby groups, including the British Chambers of Commerce, are already warning that shortages of skilled workers will damage growth.</p> <p>Despite the fall in employment, the proportion of people out of work has remained at the lowest levels since the mid-1970s. There were 1.43 million people out of work \u2013 with the unemployment rate standing at 4.3%.</p> <p>However, this record low for unemployment is failing to boost the pay of workers, despite expectations among economists for greater levels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/missing-pay-rises-the-ever-deepening-economics-mystery\" title=\"\">bargaining power to ask for a pay rise, leading to higher wages</a>. Average weekly earnings increased at a rate of 2.3%, according to the latest figures.</p> <p>That should worry the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\" title=\"\">Bank of England</a>, which kept interest rates on hold on Thursday but said it was still considering raising the cost of borrowing after the first increase in a decade last month. Threadneedle Street has been watching closely for higher wages to justify its actions, although pay growth still appears to be sluggish.</p> <p>Inflation figures last week also show prices are rising at a faster pace than wages \u2013 at 3.1%, eating away at household incomes \u2013 driven by the weak pound pushing up the cost of imported goods since the referendum. The Resolution Foundation thinktank reckons average annual pay, when taking account of inflation, may not return to its pre-financial crisis peak until at least 2025.</p> <p>There are worrying implications for poverty and inequality. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/04/uk-government-warned-over-sharp-rise-children-pensioner-poverty-study\" title=\"\">Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates 3.7&#xa0;million people with a job do not earn enough to meet minimum needs</a>, and that low wage growth and rising inflation will make it harder for them to escape poverty. As well as the social and political ramifications, this sounds another alarm over the future health of the economy, as dwindling household incomes make it harder for a family to keep on buying goods and services \u2013 one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/14/black-friday-retail-sales-uk-income-squeeze\" title=\"\">key drivers for growth</a>.Britain\u2019s jobs machine needs fixing fast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a5010ff138aeb72a33ef2170a065527718a6c6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a5010ff138aeb72a33ef2170a065527718a6c6e/0_61_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Changing his tune: Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Changing his tune: Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niall Carson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ryanair chief can afford to indulge in Christmas spirit</h2> <p>As Groucho Marx famously said: \u201cThose are my principles, and if you don\u2019t like them, well, I have others.\u201d After 30 years of deriding unions and occasionally insulting his pilots, Ryanair chief Michael O\u2019Leary has made a dramatic volte face.</p> <p>As if visited by some Dickensian nocturnal spectre, just three days after vowing to face down pilots, O\u2019Leary said Ryanair would instead recognise their unions to avert a strike.</p> <p>The abrasive billionaire has form for Damascene conversions \u2013 just four years ago, the concept of being \u201cnice\u201d to passengers infiltrated company policy, after decades of punitive charges and pantomimish outbursts against complainers.</p> <p>Had he known how good niceness was for business, O\u2019Leary has remarked since, he would have started years earlier. A shift on unions will similarly stem from business necessity, rather than any late-flowering Corbynism, and reps are right to read the offer with scepticism.</p> <p>Pilots have picked their moment to strike, with Ryanair having ordered an abundance of planes at a time when there\u2019s a shortage of people to fly them. Yet this Ryanair concession, like its changed attitude to customers, is ultimately testament to the airline\u2019s strength, rather than weakness.</p> <p>The kind of practices that ruthlessly kept costs down through its growth as an upstart airline can no longer sustain a market leader in countries across Europe. It is not challenger but incumbent: a profit-spewing giant, whose scale and unit costs are low enough to afford to invest in contented staff, rather than alienated contractors.</p> <p>Having cancelled a wave of flights this winter, Ryanair was already expecting to fork out for significant pay rises to attract and retain pilots. The airline may yet find a discount in respecting their rights, and maintaining separate negotiations across 33 countries\u2019 unions, rather than a pan-European network that was evolving.</p> <p>O\u2019Leary said it was a moment of radical change. If so, it is to be applauded \u2013 but the test of principle will be if the same olive branch is extended to its ill-served cabin crew, who have even this month been warned of collective sanctions should any individual join a strike.</p> <h2>Persimmon need to rebuild board\u2019s image</h2> <p>There is corporate excess and then there is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/15/persimmon-chair-resigns-chief-executive-obscene-bonus\" title=\"\">Persimmon bonus scheme</a>. It is astonishing, nearly a decade on from the nadir of the credit crunch, that a FTSE business is paying out \u00a3500m to 150 executives. Top of the pile is chief executive Jeff Fairburn, who between now and New Year\u2019s Eve \u2013 when the bonuses start paying out \u2013 has the chance to declare that he will donate some of the money to charity. His chair, Nicholas Wrigley, who resigned over the scheme, is said to have put pressure on his chief executive to make a donation to charity. Fairburn needs to do the right thing for himself and the reputation of British business.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In October 1517, an unknown Augustinian monk by the name of Martin Luther changed the world when he grabbed a hammer and nailed his 95 theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. The Reformation started there. The tale of how the 95 theses were posted is almost certainly false. Luther never mentioned the incident and the first account of it didn\u2019t surface until after his death. But it makes a better story than Luther writing a letter (which is what probably happened), and that\u2019s why the economist Steve Keen, dressed in a monk\u2019s habit and wielding a blow up hammer, could be found outside the London School of Economics last week. Keen and those supporting him (full disclosure: I was one of them) were making a simple point as he used Blu Tack to stick their 33 theses to one of the world\u2019s leading universities: economics needs its own Reformation just as the Catholic church did 500 years ago. Like the medieval church, orthodox economics thinks it has all the answers. Complex mathematics is used to mystify economics, just as congregations in Luther\u2019s time were deliberately left in the dark by services conducted in Latin. Neoclassical economics has become an unquestioned belief system and treats anybody who challenges the creed of self-righting markets and rational consumers as dangerous heretics. Keen was one of those heretics. He was one of the economists who knew there was big trouble brewing in the years leading up to the financial crisis of a decade ago but whose warnings were ignored. The reason Keen was proved right was that he paid no heed to the equilibrium models favoured by mainstream economics. He looked at what was actually happening rather than having a preconceived view of what ought to be happening. Somewhat depressingly, nothing much has happened, even though it was a crisis neoclassical economics said could not happen. There was a brief dalliance with unorthodox remedies when things were really bleak in the winter of 2008-09, but by late 2009 and early 2010, there was a return to business as normal. The intellectual monopoly is something of an irony given how central the idea of competition is to orthodox thinking, but it is a sad fact \u2013 as the preamble to the 33 theses notes \u2013 \u201cthat the neoclassical perspective overwhelmingly dominates teaching, research, advice to policy, and public debate\u201d. \u201cMany other perspectives that could provide valuable insights are marginalised and excluded. This is not about one theory being better than another, but the notion that scientific advance only moves ahead with a debate. Within economics, this debate has died.\u201d That debate needs to be rekindled. A more pluralist approach would take account of the complexity of markets, the constraints imposed by nature and rising inequality. So what needs to be done? Firstly, listen to consumers, because it is pretty obvious that they are unimpressed with what they are getting. The failure of the economics establishment to predict the crisis and its insistence that austerity is the right response to the events of a decade ago has meant the profession has rarely been less trusted. Of course, there were economists who got it right and some of them \u2013 Paul Krugman, for example \u2013 wielded real influence. But it should have come as little surprise that when it came to the Brexit referendum, voters took the warnings from the UK Treasury, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England with a very large pinch of salt. After all, not one of these august bodies \u2013 armed as they were with their general equilibrium models \u2013 saw the deepest recession since the second world war coming, even when it was already under way. It is welcome news that discontent is bubbling up from below on university campuses. True, the prestigious academic journals remain in the hands of the old order and in economics faculties there is strong resistance to change but increasingly students are showing their frustration at being told to learn and regurgitate economics that is not just narrow and of little relevance, but also plain wrong. Of the 33 theses pinned to the LSE, five involved the teaching of economics, with demands to be taught history and economic thought, and for the monopoly of the status quo to be broken. One of the theses demands that \u201ceconomics must do more to encourage critical thinking, and not simply reward memorisation of theories and implementation of models. Students must be encouraged to compare, contrast, and combine theories, and critically apply them to in-depth studies of the real world.\u201d The fact that students feel the need to say this is a terrible indictment of the way economics is being taught, and their discontent negates the idea that this is just whingeing from aggrieved Keynesians. Secondly, we should stop treating economics as a science because it is nothing of the sort. A proper science involves testing a hypothesis against the available evidence. If the evidence doesn\u2019t support the theory, a physicist or a biologist will discard the theory and try to come up one that does work empirically. Economics doesn\u2019t work like that. Theories can be shown to work only by making a series of highly questionable assumptions \u2013 such as that humans always behave predictably and rationally. When there is hard evidence that disputes the validity of the theory, there is no question of ditching the theory. Thirdly, economics needs to be prepared to learn from other disciplines because when it does the results are worthwhile. One example is the way in which auto-enrolment has increased pension coverage. If humans were truly economically rational, it would make no difference whether their employers automatically enrolled them into pension schemes: they would decide whether to join schemes on the basis of whether they deemed it worth deferring consumption until they had retired. Yet, basic psychology says this is not the way people actually act. They are far less likely to opt out of something than they are to opt into something. Fourthly, economics needs to be demystified. One of the big battles between Catholics and Protestants in mid-16th century England was over whether the bible should be in Latin or English, a recognition that language matters. The easy part of an economic Reformation is to attack the current establishment; the difficult part is to present a compelling story without resorting to jargon. Control of the narrative \u2013 as George Osborne realised when he criticised Labour for failing to mend the roof while the sun was shining \u2013 is crucial. At the launch of the 33 theses last week, Victoria Chick, emeritus professor of economics at University College London, put it this way: \u201cThe economics mainstream has the hallmarks of certain religions. They think they have the truth. But read for yourself and think for yourself. Change has occurred before and it can occur again.\u201d She\u2019s right.

      "bodyText": "My football team, AFC Wimbledon, may be languishing down in the third division, as it was once called, but the Conservative MP for Wimbledon, Stephen Hammond, showed himself to be in the Premier League last week. In that refreshing, surprising vote on Thursday, he and his fellow Tory rebels stood up to be counted in the cause of parliamentary democracy. By voting against Theresa May\u2019s plan to prevent parliament from having the last say on whether the terms of any Brexit deal should be accepted, they joined the noble ranks of \u201cmutineers\u201d and \u201cenemies of the people\u201d. As regular readers know, I still hope that things will not get that far, and that, somehow or other, sense will prevail as the size of the potential disaster of a Brexit sinks in. And already the deleterious economic impact of the referendum-induced devaluation is becoming apparent. Incidentally, may I respectfully remind people that Brexit has not happened yet? Even seasoned interviewers on Radio 4 make the mistake of confusing the referendum with Brexit. The hope among us unashamed Remainers is that opinion will shift sufficiently for the development of a burgeoning realisation that the country made a serious mistake on 23 June last year, not least because enough voters were misled by the blatant lies of Boris Johnson and his ilk. Also, it has to be said, the Remain campaign failed in its patriotic duty to explain the economic and strategic benefits of the European Union \u2013 a failure pinpointed in Gordon Brown\u2019s book Britain: Leading, Not Leaving, where he says of our role in the union: \u201cBritain can argue for, and achieve, the best balance between national autonomy and international cooperation for the 21st century.\u201d And in his recently published memoirs, Brown also tells us that, when he addressed the European parliament in March 2009 on the need for the collective economic stimulus which did indeed \u201csave the world\u201d, the only hecklers were those British founts of Eurosceptical bile, Nigel Farage and Daniel Hannan. They are a curious mixture, the Brexiters. There are the neoliberal ideologues, such as my old friend Lord Lawson, who unashamedly wish to bury the security and protection of Enlightenment values afforded by the EU and, in Lawson\u2019s words, finish the \u201cThatcher revolution\u201d \u2013 as if that revolution had not finished off enough people\u2019s hopes already. But the ideologues themselves are a relatively small band \u2013 the tail that wags the dog, as it were. I am continually surprised, indeed shocked, by the frequency with which I encounter people who have not been \u201cleft behind\u201d but who, for minor prejudicial reasons, voted to Leave \u2013 often on the not-so-safe assumption that Remain was going to be triumphant and a protest vote would do no harm. Some hope! Which brings us to the real problem that has engulfed otherwise sensible Remain MPs: most of them have been so pusillanimous in the face of their \u201cleft behind\u201d constituents that they have forgotten Edmund Burke\u2019s dictum that their duty is to be representatives, not delegates \u2013 to apply their judgment, not act as conduits for prejudices they do not share. My impression is that the despair, indeed anger, felt by \u201cleft behind\u201d Brexit voters is the accumulated result of the Thatcher regime\u2019s neglect of the north and manufacturing, compounded by the impact of globalisation: as analysts are pointing out a lot these days, the losers from globalisation have simply not been compensated from a pot whose proceeds should have been distributed more equitably. Now, Lawson has proclaimed in his Thatcher lecture that \u201cthe time has come to call an end to this demeaning process\u201d. The process to which he refers is May\u2019s attempts to square the circle of the Conservative party\u2019s conflicting demands from Brexit. No, Lawson wants to leave the EU now, and rely on starting all over again in the World Trade Organisation \u2013 a WTO whose very function, and therefore future, is now being questioned and threatened by the egregious Donald Trump. I am not making this up. The truth is that the time has come to call an end to the demeaning process that has been set in train by a misleading and badly conducted referendum. MPs and others need to tell it as it is. If the governor of the Bank of England can, so can they. Already, enlightened MPs tell me the ground is shifting slowly in the direction of Remain. One recent poll showed 53% for Remain, against 47% Leave. There seems to be a consensus that if this became 60% versus 40%, that could be decisive. As the veteran pollster Sir Robert Worcester recently reminded me, beneath a seemingly small shift in polling there can lie a lot of what he calls \u201cchurning\u201d: in other words, a net shift of one percentage point may be the result of 6% of people changing their minds one way, and 7% the other. Can it be beyond the bounds of possibility that, as the economic horrors dawn, the churn begins to favour Remain after all? Meanwhile, the message has to be got across to those \u201cleft behind\u201d who said they had nothing to lose that, almost certainly, if they don\u2019t change their minds, they have even more to lose.",

      "bodyText": "While the Daily Mail, with Pavlovian regularity, persists in ringing the \u201cMarxist\u201d alarm bell, the Financial Times is a little more measured. \u201cLabour has a fair wind\u201d with business leaders, the paper argued this month, \u201cwith many terrified of a hard Brexit\u201d. At the CBI\u2019s annual conference in November, leaders of industry gave Jeremy Corbyn a distinctly warmer welcome than they gave Theresa May. That should come as no surprise, given the destabilising extremism of the Conservative Brexiters. Their echoing of hard-right American Republican ideology and advocacy of a hard Brexit is based on the belief that the UK\u2019s economic interests, in particular the NHS and public services, would benefit from subjugation to American oligopolistic capital. Hence the calls for the UK to join the North American Free Trade Agreement. Yet, at the same time, polling shows that the British people are disillusioned with the privatisation of key sectors, and favour nationalisation. They seek protection from the impact of deregulated market forces on their lives and livelihoods and on their children\u2019s prospects. Business leaders have been made aware \u2013 by the IMF, the OECD and the Bank for International Settlements \u2013 that the Conservatives\u2019 dependence on what David Cameron called his government\u2019s \u201cmonetary radicalism and fiscal conservatism\u201d has gone too far. There is now real concern about the long-term impact of quantitative easing which, coupled with austerity, has led to rocketing asset prices, falling wages and rising inequality. Those with access to central bank largesse have been enriched as the prices of assets have risen; while those without assets and dependent on earnings have suffered as incomes have fallen in real terms. Falling incomes and spare capacity have not been good for business. While the Treasury, the Office for Budget Responsibility, an independent watchdog, and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a thinktank, have obsessed over supply-side issues, politicians have been persuaded by economists to sit on their hands, as Britain\u2019s economy falters under huge, unused capacity. Howard Bogod, who runs a business with a turnover of under \u00a320m, wrote recently: \u201cEconomic models have failed to explain why wages have not increased as unemployment has fallen so low. These same models are incorrect in their conclusions about productivity growth \u2013 indeed these two failures are linked. My conclusion based on observing actual businesses is that if nominal demand were to continue to grow then both productivity and real wages would start to grow more quickly, and economists would again be left scratching their heads.\u201d There is, nevertheless, anxiety over the scale of Labour\u2019s public investment plans and their impact on the UK\u2019s credit rating. But Labour has a record, in key respects, of being more fiscally conservative than Conservatives. For example, a review by economists at Policy Research in Macroeconomics of current budget deficits or surpluses (that is, excluding public investment) for the whole period before the global financial crisis, from 1956 to 2008, reveals that Conservative governments had an average annual surplus of 0.3% of GDP, while Labour governments had an average annual surplus of 1.1%. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s plans include a commitment to a \u201cfiscal credibility rule\u201d \u2013 the state would only borrow to invest in capital projects which will, over time, pay for themselves. In the event of a recession, this rule would only be suspended when technocrats at the Bank of England decide monetary policy can no longer operate with interest rates around 0%. By contrast, George Osborne and Philip Hammond\u2019s fiscal rule gives the chancellor more discretion in the \u201cevent of a significant negative shock\u201d quite broadly defined. Here I must acknowledge a disagreement with Professor Simon Wren-Lewis, of Oxford University, who advised Labour to adopt a fiscal rule that once again prioritises monetary policy, and in some respects is more constraining than Gordon Brown\u2019s \u201cgolden rule\u201d. I would prefer a fiscal rule aimed at using government (and central bank) firepower to secure the UK\u2019s economic security and prosperity, first and foremost. The best way to cut the deficit and public debt, as is well understood, is to ensure that prosperity generates the jobs and tax revenues that will, in turn, balance the government\u2019s books. In 2016, UK investment remained pitiably low \u2013 116th out of 141 countries in terms of capital investment as a percentage of GDP. Labour\u2019s public spending plans will boost investment, with contracts that largely benefit the \u201ctimid mouse\u201d (as Professor Mariana Mazzucato characterises it) that is the private sector. In other words, the \u201croaring lion\u201d that is a government backed by a central bank, will, under Labour, at last take action to stimulate a private sector that has significant spare capacity; one not yet fully recovered from the catastrophic impact of the great financial crisis and that still lacks confidence. Business leaders know their biggest problem is spare capacity and a shortage of customers coming through the door. That is why they have been willing to listen to the shadow chancellor\u2019s \u201ctea offensive\u201d, and that is why they will ignore the Daily Mail\u2019s Pavlovian howling.
