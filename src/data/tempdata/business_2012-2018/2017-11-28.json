      "bodyText": "Rail services lost under the Beeching cuts could be restored to increase jobs and growth, under plans drawn up by the transport secretary to expand the rail network. The government will invite proposals to reopen lines that were closed down following reports by Dr Richard Beeching in the 1960s, or under later British Rail cuts in the 1970s. But Labour pointed out that no additional money or firm schemes had been announced and the government recently culled major rail upgrades, including the electrification of lines in the Midlands and Wales. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said: \u201cMany commuter services are full and getting busier and passengers know how much pressure the network is under ... We need to expand our network to unlock jobs and housing growth across the country.\u201d Plans were being accelerated to reopen the railway line from Oxford to Cambridge, branded East West Rail, he said, which the government hopes will involve private sector funding to support the construction of thousands of new homes. \u201cNow I want to see how we can expand other parts of the network to help make Britain fit for the future,\u201d Grayling said. He said the government would seek to work with local partners to develop proposals for similar schemes, which would need to demonstrate strong business cases to receive state funds. The Beeching cuts, prompted by two reports by the then British Rail chairman, led to more than 4,000 miles of track being taken out of the network. Road transport, especially for freight, was seen as a more efficient future option. Grayling\u2019s offer to reverse some of those cuts will be set out in a rail strategy plan published on Wednesday, which will also detail changes to some current routes, expected to include the breakup of the biggest commuter franchise run by Govia Thameslink Railway, which covers the troubled Southern. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, dismissed the strategy as \u201creannouncements and unfunded proposals\u201d. \u201cThe Tories\u2019 record is of delayed, downgraded and cancelled investment, huge disparities in regional transport spending and soaring fares that are pricing passengers off the railway,\u201d he said. Transport campaigners gave the news a cautious welcome. Stephen Joseph, the chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said looking to connect communities and support jobs and housing was \u201cgreat news\u201d, but added: \u201cIt is desperately difficult to reopen a rail line. \u201cThis announcement needs to be backed both with new investment and a commitment to guiding local authorities through the sometimes labyrinthine processes of the railway.\u201d Mick Cash, the RMT general secretary, said the move would be \u201cjust more broken promises\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a bit rich for Chris Grayling to talk about expanding rail capacity in the distant future when the reality is that today he is cutting back on rail electrification and staffing,\u201d he said. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of the drivers\u2019 union Aslef, said: \u201cWe would be pleased to see the lines cut by Beeching restored. \u201c[But] refining or extending the failed franchising system, for example by encouraging more open access operators, will only make an already overly complicated system worse, not better.\u201d",

Instead of infuriating either Theresa May or her Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, at a delicate moment in the Brexit talks, he will do so at a later date. The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant had said it would choose between London and Rotterdam for its sole headquarters by the end of this year. Now the announcement will come \u201cin due course.\u201d Only 100 jobs or so will be affected directly, but do not doubt that the location of Unilever\u2019s HQ matters to politicians. Look at what has happened since April, which was when the Dove-to-Lipton group launched the review of its dual-headed Anglo-Dutch structure. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister \u2013 a former employee of Unilever, note \u2013 has risked a political storm by planning to overhaul local tax rules on dividends so as not to penalise international investors in Dutch companies. He will look a fool if Unilever refuses his red carpet. In the UK, there is a proposal to change the takeover code to the advantage of defending companies. Polman, it so happened, had been complaining about unlevel playing fields, despite Unilever\u2019s great escape from Kraft Heinz\u2019s financial engineers. The tweak may not satisfy his worries, but it\u2019s something and was supposed to be symbolic of May\u2019s preference for Unilever-style long-term capitalism. The Rotterdam threat is said to terrify UK ministers and you can understand why. Losing a top-10 FTSE 100 company during the fog of Brexit would look terrible. Worse, Shell, which is equally Anglo-Dutch but even larger than Unilever, might follow, just at the moment the City is supposed to be luring Saudi Aramco. Who will win? It\u2019s possible Unilever\u2019s directors really are undecided. But it remains the case that Unilever has a Dutch chairman and Dutch chief executive. The pair will do their fiduciary duty and all that, but sometimes home advantage in the boardroom counts. Even in extra time, you\u2019d bet on the Netherlands. Don\u2019t stress, banks are braced for the next crisis Better European news: the UK\u2019s big banks can withstand a hard Brexit, judges the Bank of England. This development is obviously welcome, but don\u2019t get too excited. First, if any bank had failed the Bank\u2019s stress tests, it would be late in the day to run around trying to raise fresh capital. Second, the stressed picture of Brexit painted by the Bank doesn\u2019t sound comfortable for the rest of us. Threadneedle Street tested for a doubling in the rate of unemployment, a 4.7% fall in GDP, a 27% drop in the pound and a rise in interest rates from 0.5% to 4%. Governor Mark Carney said this would describe \u201cthe outer bounds\u201d of disorderly Brexit. The inner bounds don\u2019t sound nice either. Third, the bank\u2019s ability to keep lending to the UK economy after a hard Brexit is not the whole story. The Bank takes account of \u201cmanagement actions,\u201d including the sacrifice of shareholders\u2019 dividends. If dividends were to be binned, share prices would fall and, since the average pension fund has a good helping of financial stocks, most of us would be poorer. Still, let\u2019s not panic. It is also plainly true that the UK banking system has been transformed from its junk-ridden and over-leveraged state of 2008. The Bank reckons banks now hold \u00a3222bn of the best type of capital, an increase of \u00a3115bn from the depths of the financial crisis. Is that enough? Nobody really knows until the next crisis arrives but \u201cresilient\u201d \u2013 the Bank\u2019s word \u2013 is a credible description. Time is up for London Stock Exchange CEO Xavier Rolet, the chief executive of London Stock Exchange, should take a hint: it\u2019s time to bow out. Certainly, the Carney cavalry is not about to arrive to save his job. \u201cI can\u2019t envision a circumstance where the CEO stays on beyond the agreed period,\u201d said the governor. So, tough luck, The Children\u2019s Investment Fund (TCI), the hedge fund that had called on regulators to intervene to resolve what it calls \u201ca corporate governance crisis\u201d. TCI wants Donald Brydon, the LSE chairman, to be sacked and Rolet to continue his successful stint as boss. If TCI is to get its way, it will have to convince other shareholders, a task that was daunting before Carney\u2019s comments and is harder after them. \u201cWe knew about the succession plan, we\u2019ve stayed close to the situation,\u201d he said. In other words, the Bank saw nothing amiss: boards are allowed to change the chief executive, even if he or she doesn\u2019t wish to go. Brydon and the other non-executives, as argued here more than once, were shockingly arrogant in not explaining their thinking to shareholders \u2013 and it\u2019s good that they are forced by TCI to do so. But, barring a miraculous turn of events, Rolet will still be leaving.",

    "webTitle": "PM talks Paradise Papers and tax avoidance with UK overseas territories", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May discussed the Paradise Papers with the leaders of 10 British overseas territories at their annual gathering in Downing Street on Tuesday, with the prime minister urging further action to combat tax avoidance. A cross-party group of 12 MPs wrote to the prime minister last week requesting she set a deadline for tax haven jurisdictions under British control to publish registers of the real owners of shell companies. May raised the issue of public registers at the meeting, a government source confirmed, and said work on tax avoidance could help enhance reputations internationally. However, the prime minister has so far refused to endorse the measure, which was championed by her predecessor, David Cameron. The annual joint ministerial council was attended by leaders from Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands, whose territories have been revealed in the Paradise Papers and elsewhere as major conduits for illicit offshore activity. Half of the 240,000 shell companies represented by the law firm Mossack Fonseca, whose activities were exposed in last year\u2019s Panama Papers and whose founders have since been arrested on money-laundering charges, were incorporated in the BVI.

      "bodyText": "Britain is to become the first country where Viagra can be bought over the counter, the medicines regulator has announced. The drug has been been credited with revolutionising treatment for male impotence and reducing stigma surrounding the condition since its commercial launch in 1998 but has become a popular target for criminals. Announcing its decision on Tuesday, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said it hopes the move will stop men seeking to buy it from unregulated websites. While prescriptions of Viagra and other erectile dysfunction drugs containing sildenafil have tripled in Britain in a decade \u2013 there were 2,958,199 prescriptions in 2016, compared with 1,042,431 in 2006 \u2013 there is still a large black market. Last year, \u00a317m worth of unlicensed and counterfeit Viagra was seized. The manufacturer, Pfizer, said it hopes that Viagra Connect will go on sale over the counter in pharmacies in spring next year. It will be available in a four-tablet pack and eight-tablet pack, with recommended retail prices of \u00a319.99 and \u00a334.99 respectively. Mick Foy, the MHRA\u2019s group manager in vigilance and risk management of medicines, said: \u201cErectile dysfunction can be a debilitating condition, so it\u2019s important men feel they have fast access to quality and legitimate care, and do not feel they need to turn to counterfeit online supplies which could have potentially serious side-effects.\u201d The MHRA said the decision was made after a safety assessment, advice from the Commission on Human Medicines, and positive responses to a public consultation earlier this year. Its investigators have have seized more than \u00a350m of unlicensed and counterfeit medicines for impotence over the past five years. Since its commercial release in 1998, the famous blue pill, which was a failed treatment for angina, has been used to improve the sex lives of millions of men worldwide. It has opened up conversation about male impotence, although some say it has become a lifestyle drug. Pfizer\u2019s patent ended in 2013 but it has earned the pharmaceutical giant more than \u00a31bn a year. The company\u2019s UK medical director, Dr Berkeley Phillips, said: \u201cWe understand some men may avoid seeking support and treatment for this condition, so we believe giving them the option to talk to a pharmacist and buy Viagra Connect could be a real step forward in encouraging more men into the healthcare system. \u201cAs erectile dysfunction may be a sign of an underlying condition such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease, there could also be a wider benefit to public health in the long term. We hope that this forthcoming new opportunity to purchase a genuine treatment via pharmacy will also reduce the likelihood of men turning to potentially ineffective and dangerous counterfeits from illicit sources.\u201d Men wishing to buy it will be required to consult the pharmacist, who will determine whether it is appropriate for the patient, outline possible side-effects and suggest a consultation with a GP if deemed necessary. Viagra Connect will not be sold to men with severe cardiovascular disorders or at high cardiovascular risk, or to patients with liver failure or taking certain interacting medicines. In such cases they will still have to see their GP. Pfizer also recommends that pharmacists should advise all men to follow up with their doctor within six months of first being supplied the product. Dr David Edwards, a GP with a special interest in sexual dysfunction and a past president of the British Society of Sexual Medicine, said: \u201cIn my clinical experience a man\u2019s ability to attain and maintain an erection is of paramount importance to him. \u201cWhen erection difficulties do occur, emotional and physical closeness between a man and his partner can diminish, leaving a man with a sense of isolation and lacking confidence in day-to-day life. A new initiative that enables men to go to a pharmacy to get help for their erectile dysfunction is welcome.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "HMV is predicting its biggest year for vinyl music sales since the late 80s as records make a comeback on the UK\u2019s Christmas wish lists. The music retailer said demand was soaring across all genres, with Ed Sheeran\u2019s Divide on track to be its biggest selling vinyl record of the year, followed by the solo efforts of Liam and Noel Gallagher, formerly of Oasis, in second and third place. John Hirst, music manager at HMV, said: \u201cA strong year for new releases from artists such as Ed Sheeran and Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man has been followed up with a really strong back end, with the Gallagher brothers driving the LP sales into the final quarter.\u201d Music fans are falling back in love with vinyl in a big way. The BPI, the industry\u2019s trade body, predicts UK sales of vinyl albums will exceed 4m \u2013 the highest since it began collecting data in the early 90s. Britons bought 3.2m LPs last year, a rise of 53% on 2015 and the largest number since 1991, when Stars by Simply Red was the bestselling album. The current boom has been fuelled by nostalgia surrounding the deaths of artists such as Prince and David Bowie, who was the bestselling vinyl artist of 2016, with five albums featuring posthumously in the top 30. With the 11-year-old Back to Black album by the late Amy Winehouse also in HMV\u2019s vinyl top five, ahead of Human by Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man, the sales data points to consumers also turning to older, classic albums. Hirst said: \u201cSales also continue to soar across our back catalogue, perhaps as people use streaming as a discovery tool alongside wanting to browse and collect physical music formats.\u201d The vinyl surge resulted in the first rise in physical music sales in a decade in the first six months of 2017, up 2.5% to \u00a3198m, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association. In the same period, streaming and downloads on services such as Spotify and Apple Music increased in value by 16.6% year on year to \u00a3366.6m, accounting for two-thirds of the \u00a3564m music sales total in the UK. The vinyl revival has helped offset the decline of the CD, with sales up 37.6% to \u00a337.3m in the period, led by Sheeran, with the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack and the Beatles\u2019 Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band also making the the top five sellers in first half of 2017. The growing popularity of the format led to the return of the top 10 and top 40 vinyl charts in 2015. HMV rings up a third of all LP sales in the UK and, with sales up 31% on last year, its success points to another bumper year for vinyl. The retailer, the last surviving high street music chain on the high street with 132 stores, expects to sell 1.5m records this year \u2013 more than the entire album market in 1994. The success of a format that once looked set to go the way of the cassette and the MiniDisc has encouraged Sainsbury\u2019s to launch a line of own-brand vinyl albums in the run-up to Christmas. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Grocery and tobacco wholesaler Palmer &amp; Harvey has gone into administration with 2,500 immediate redundancies and a further 900 jobs at risk. The group, which delivers goods to 90,000 grocery and convenience stores, including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and the Costcutter chain, has been scrambling to shore up its finances since the spring. The UK\u2019s biggest tobacco supplier called in administrators and ceased deliveries on Tuesday after hitting \u201cchallenging trading conditions\u201d while efforts to restructure the business have been unsuccessful. A statement by administrators at PricewaterhouseCoopers blamed cash flow pressures and a failure to secure additional funding to support the business. The collapse raises the prospect of cigarette shortages around the UK. Japan Tobacco, a P&amp;H customer and the owner of brands including Silk Cut, Camel and Benson &amp; Hedges, said it did not expect any significant interruption in supply of its products. Sainsbury\u2019s and Costcutter said they had activated contingency plans while Tesco said it would work to ensure to would continue to meet customers\u2019 needs. Matthew Callaghan, joint administrator at PwC, said: \u201cThe Palmer &amp; Harvey name has been a trusted partner for retailers and suppliers for nearly 100 years. This is a devastating blow for everyone who has been involved in the business. The administration team will focus on working with employees, clients and suppliers to facilitate a smooth and effective wind-down or transfer of operations over the next few weeks.\u201d Callaghan said the company had insufficient cash resources to continue to trade beyond the short-term and the directors had concluded that there was no longer any reasonable prospect of a sale. Administrators are exploring options for a sale of several subsidiaries. However, P&amp;H Direct Van Sales; P&amp;H Sweetdirect and P&amp;H Snacksdirect, which sell confectionary and drinks direct from vans to convenience stores, have ceased to trade, although about 450 employees have been retained. The collapse of the main business affects thousands of jobs in P&amp;H\u2019s network of 14 regional depots, its head office in Hove and drivers of its fleet of vans. The company has two depots in Fareham, Hampshire, two in Leeds as well as sites across the country including Bristol, Dunfermline and Hemel Hempstead. Mark Todd, national officer for the Usdaw, which represents some P&amp;H workers, said the union was \u201cdeeply concerned at the devastating news\u201d and was seeking an urgent meeting with administrators about the job losses. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a massive shock to our members and is an extremely distressing situation for all concerned, especially in the run up to Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will of course be doing everything possible to protect our members interests going forward.\u201d The demise of privately owned P&amp;H comes amid a shake-out in the grocery wholesale market. Tesco won provisional approval of its takeover of Booker this month, while the Co-op\u2019s buyout of Nisa won the backing of shareholders a few weeks ago. The Costcutter chain is also thought to be in negotiations over a buyout or new supply deal with potential partners, including the Co-op, while McColl\u2019s has signed a supply deal with Morrisons. P&amp;H had been in exclusive talks with private equity group Carlyle, which were expected to result in a takeover being agreed before Christmas. That deal was reportedly conditional on cigarette firms Imperial and Japan Tobacco offering \u00a360m in loans and providing additional funding to keep the business afloat. But talks ended abruptly on Tuesday after P&amp;H said it had uncovered a serious cashflow problem. About 40% of P&amp;H\u2019s business comes from Tesco, and there had been fears the relationship would unwind as a result of the supermarket\u2019s planned \u00a33.7bn buyout of Booker. But in April, Tesco signed a new three-year agreement under which P&amp;H would distribute tobacco and stamps to every Tesco in the UK as well as some groceries to petrol forecourts and frozen food to more than 1,700 Tesco Express stores. P&amp;H also delivers groceries to more than 30 Morrisons Daily petrol forecourt stores and tobacco to all Sainsbury\u2019s stores. Companies House filings reveal that P&amp;H\u2019s losses nearly doubled between 2015 and 2016, rising from \u00a38.4m to \u00a316.4m, as operating profits were wiped out by the cost of servicing its debts. P&amp;H spent \u00a336.6m on interest payments over the past two years on debts of more than \u00a31bn. This year\u2019s accounts were due to be filed on on 7 October but are listed as overdue at Companies House. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Australian companies need to start developing sophisticated scenario-based analyses of climate risks, and incorporating them into their business outlooks so shareholders know how climate change will affect profitability, a thinktank has said. However, the Centre for Policy Development (CPD) said companies needed to do so in a standardised way, so investors and regulators were able to easily understand economy-wide risks to whole industries. The progressive thinktank urged Australia\u2019s biggest businesses to use the Paris climate agreement as the centrepiece for their scenario planning, saying it provided a credible, long-term anchor for policies that limit global warming to well below 2C. The group has released a discussion paper, called \u201cClimate horizons: next steps for scenario analysis in Australia\u201d, explaining the best way to do so. Australia\u2019s financial regulator warned in February that climate change posed a material risk to the entire financial system and urged companies to start adapting. Geoff Summerhayes, from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra), told the Insurance Council of Australia\u2019s annual forum in Sydney in February that Apra wanted companies to start incorporating \u201cscenario-based analysis\u201d of climate risks into their business outlooks. He said Apra intended to start running stress tests of the financial system to see if it would survive various climate shocks, and all Apra-regulated entities would need to adapt to the coming regulatory changes. \u201cI think the days of viewing climate change within a purely ethical, environmental or long-term frame have passed,\u201d Summerhayes said. The CPD\u2019s new discussion paper suggested how Australian businesses could be consistent with the country\u2019s international climate commitments under the Paris agreement and with the leading international framework for robust climate disclosures, the Financial Stability Board\u2019s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD). It said businesses ought to try to develop a standardised approach to scenario-based analysis, and that all scenario analyses should include: A scenario that is genuinely consistent with Paris targets. It should therefore incorporate a high probability of limiting warming to below 2C, and towards 1.5C A scenario that includes the physical impacts of climate change, not just transition risks Engage with the most relevant sectoral or regional scenarios and resources available Be transparent about assumptions and parameters used to develop the scenarios, in line with the TCFD disclosure framework Show evidence that management is overhauling their business models in response to scenario analysis results Sam Hurley, the CPD\u2019s policy director, said shareholders, courts and regulators like Apra clearly expected businesses and investors to prepare for climate change and also for the major physical impacts that are likely even if severe global warming of 2C or more is avoided. CPD fellow Kate Mackenzie, a co-author of the paper, said many of the climate reference scenarios used by businesses only had a 50% chance of keeping global warming to 2C or less. \u201cBusiness-as-usual approaches have us on track for warming of three degrees or more, which would be incredibly damaging both economically and environmentally,\u201d she said. \u201cScenario analysis work that does not factor in robust Paris-consistent scenarios will mean companies and investors underestimate the scale of the risks present and transitions required to meet Paris targets \u2013 and the opportunities that this transition will also create.\u201d The CPD discussion paper will be discussed at a public forum in Sydney on Wednesday. Summerhayes will be speaking at the event, along with Steven Skala, the chair of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Christina Tonkin, the managing director of specialised finance at ANZ, and new CPD board member Sam Mostyn.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rising household debt and flatlining wages are becoming a major financial stability risk as Britain slows as a consequence of Brexit, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has said. The warning from the Paris-based thinktank on Tuesday came as it argued Brexit uncertainty will result in Britain missing an upswing in global growth next year. The OECD forecasts UK growth will be the slowest among G7 nations next year, down from 1.5% this year to 1.2% in 2018 and 1.1% in 2019, when only Japan will grow at a slower rate. The OECD warned that personal loans such as credit cards were at greater risk of default than mortgages if economic conditions worsened, as it called for tougher affordability checks to be introduced to stop banks from running into trouble. However, the Bank of England on Tuesday said Britain\u2019s biggest high street banks could withstand the economic consequences of a disorderly brexit. In its latest assessment of the global economy, the OECD found job creation in the UK was losing momentum, while consumer spending would remain subdued as higher inflation, pushed up by the depreciation of sterling after the Brexit vote, continued to hold back household purchasing power. While a weaker pound should help to increase exports, import growth is projected to fall as a consequence of weaker private consumption, it added. \u201cThe major risk for the economy is the uncertainty surrounding the exit process from the European Union, which could hold back private spending more than projected,\u201d its report found, adding that the prospect of maintaining the \u201cclosest possible economic relationship\u201d with the EU would lead to stronger-than-expected growth. The gloomy outlook comes a week after Philip Hammond delivered the sharpest downgrade in economic growth at a budget since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Faced with evidence showing the UK will be one of the weakest-growing major economies in the next five years, the chancellor placed a stamp duty cut for first-time buyers at the heart of his tax and spending package. The government also published its industrial strategy white paper this week in an effort to improve the UK\u2019s sputtering record on productivity growth, which has held back economic growth and pay since the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the OECD forecasts that global growth will reach 3.6% this year, up from a previous forecast of 3.5%, led by India, China and a recovery in the euro area, before accelerating to 3.7% in 2018. It said a modest fallback in global growth would come in 2019, back to this year\u2019s levels, as longer-term challenges inhibit stronger, more inclusive and resilient economies. Jos\u00e9 Angel Gurr\u00eda, the OECD general secretary, said: \u201cGrowth has picked up momentum and the short-term outlook is positive, but there are still clear weaknesses and vulnerabilities. \u201cThere is a need to focus structural and fiscal action on boosting long-term potential as monetary policy support is reduced. Countries should implement reform packages that catalyse the private sector to promote productivity, higher wages and more inclusive growth.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Carney said the Bank had reached this judgment after considering a variety of factors, including the logistical impact faced by airlines and customs, as well as issues the City faces from processing complex derivatives transactions without a transition deal. It also took account of the results of this year\u2019s stress tests on the UK\u2019s leading banks, which would lose \u00a350bn collectively under the scenarios the Bank imposed. Carney said a disorderly Brexit would have an impact that was \u201cno worse\u201d than this year\u2019s tests which, while not explicitly modelling the impact of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, were at the extreme end of what might be expected. So what was the economic scenario in the stress test? Economic growth UK GDP falls by 4.7%. This is smaller than the 6.3% peak-to-trough fall during the financial crisis nearly a decade ago. But the impact on unemployment is greater, with the rate reaching 9.5%, double the current level, and more than the 8.4% it reached during the recession after the banking crisis. Unemployment does reach the level of nearly 12%, as in the early 1980s. The increase in unemployment, however, during the period of the stress tests is greater than after the 2008 crisis \u2013 rising from 5.2% at the end of 2007 to 8.4% in the last three months of 2011. In the stress scenario it increased by 4.7 percentage points. Under the scenario, global GDP falls by 2.4%, which is greater than the 1.9% fall during the financial crisis. Interest rates When the scenario was published in March, interest rates were at 0.25% (although they were increased to 0.5% earlier this month). In the scenario, rates rise to 4% which the Bank pointed to is in contrast to the banking crisis when interest rates were cut by five percentage points from 5.5% at the start of March 2008 to 0.5% by March 2009. House prices The Bank of England factored in a record 33% fall in UK house prices during the period of the stress tests. During the banking crisis they fell 19%. Sterling One of the major impacts of Brexit has been the fall in the pound which is down more than 10% since the referendum. It currently trades at $1.32.

      "bodyText": "And finally....Today\u2019s stress tests showed that UK banks are better capitalised to ride out the next crisis. But should they put that capital to better use? Accenture\u2019s managing director, Finance &amp; Risk, Peter Beardshaw, argues that they should be more innovative: \u201cBanks have come a long way since the crisis and are showing themselves to be more robust when tested against a comprehensive set of scenarios. It\u2019s not just their capital buffers, banks have also heavily invested in being ready for upcoming ring-fencing, MiFID II and PSD2 regulation. So if banks are showing regulators they have a more robust structure, should they now be encouraged to unlock some of that capital and inject it into the economy? Doing so could mean further lending to SMEs or more digital investment for innovating for their customers, and improving their operational resilience. \u201cOverall, while banks may be better placed to face problems from the past, they must also be ready for risks of the future. Banks will need to show their resilience when it comes to technology and digital disruption on the horizon, especially as the threat of cybercrime increases and banks get ready for data protection laws.\u201d That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The Guardian\u2019s latest Brexit dashboard is out! And it suggests that the UK\u2019s economy picked up a little this month. My colleague Richard Partington explains: The country has kept on an even keel as exporters were bolstered by growth in global trade, while the improvement in the outlook for the rest of the world is helping to offset weakness at home. Households continue to feel the squeeze from inflation, prompted by the weak pound since the Brexit vote, but the rate at which prices rose in the UK stayed at 3% despite expectations of a further increase. Still, questions remain over the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with Europe, while Philip Hammond\u2019s budget revealed a forecast for a slowdown in economic growth for the years to come. Here\u2019s the full report: These key charts provide more details: PwC\u2019s Andrew Sentance and Dartmouth College professor David Blanchflower have given their verdict: James Hurley of The Times has spotted an interesting new line in the FCA\u2019s report into Royal Bank of Scotland: The news that Britain\u2019s banks could survive a hard Brexit (as long as it didn\u2019t coincide with a wider economic crisis) will have been welcomed by the UK government, as it heads towards a crucial EU summit in December. But any relief should be tempered by the Bank of England\u2019s warning that the City needs a transition deal of at least two years, with no time to lose. Simon Morris, a financial services partner with law firm CMS, says Mark Carney is quite right to warn against a disorderly Brexit. \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s repeated warnings that a shambolic Brexit stands to damage the UK financial system highlights the need for early Government agreement on the new regulatory landscape plus a proper transition period to adapt to it. Firms need every minute of three years, and not just the 70 weeks left in the Article 50 notice period, to plan around the greatest disruption to the established financial system since the outbreak of war in 1939.\u201d Elsewhere in the City, hedge funds who bet against online grocery firm Ocado are nursing burned fingers today. Shares in Ocado have surged by over 20% today, after it announced it had secured a deal French retailer Groupe Casino. Under the agreement, Casino will build a new \u201cstate-of-the-art automated warehouse\u201d based on Ocado\u2019s technology. Ocado has long been promising that it was working on a major overseas deal with a European retailer. But it has become one of the most \u2018shorted\u2019 stocks in the City, with speculators betting that it wouldn\u2019t deliver the goods.... Lloyds Banking Group are now the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, down 2.7% at 63.8p, despite passing today\u2019s stress tests. Barclays are also lagging, down 1.7%, having struggled in the stress tests. Other banks are having a better day, with HSBC up almost 1%. David Madden of CMC Markets says bank shares are a mixed bunch today: Despite been given a clean bill of health, Lloyds, RBS and Barclays are in the red, while HSBC and Standard Chartered are in positive territory. Barclays and RBS were cited as the weakest of the bunch. BoE chief Mark Carney stated the UK banking system can withstand the UK leaving the EU, but a \u2018disorderly\u2019 and \u2018sharp\u2019 Brexit could be costly. HSBC and Standard Chartered have far more exposure to emerging markets than they do to Europe, which is helping the share price this morning. City analysts are now giving their verdict on today\u2019s UK bank stress tests. Rob James, co-manager of the Old Mutual Contingent Capital Fund, is impressed that Britain\u2019s financial sector can stomach losses of \u00a350bn if the economy takes a sharp dive. He writes: What is deeply reassuring about this year\u2019s test... is that every bank passed. So in answer to that perennial question, \u201cAre we nearly there yet?\u201d this time the response is a resounding, \u201cyes\u201d. The implication is that our banking system can now absorb catastrophic losses, including the continuation of litigation and conduct fines, and still be in a position to supply credit to the economy during the stress. Joe Dickerson, equity analyst at Jefferies, says shareholders shouldn\u2019t expect any big windfalls from the banks, though. Our conclusion is that investors expecting near-term capital distribution from Standard Chartered and Barclays may be disappointed and for Lloyds...investors shouldn\u2019t be heroic about large special distributions in 2018-19. William Anderson Jones, Head of UK Corporate Dealing at RationalFX, says the stress tests should reassure investors. \u201cUK banks have proven that they would be able to withstand a disorderly Brexit, as results of recent stress tests have shown today. BoE Governor Mark Carney confirmed that all of Britain\u2019s biggest banks were able to pass their most rigorous examination yet, testing their ability to withstand a financial crisis. The resilience of the banking system will prove a reassurance to investors, as the outcome of Brexit remains unclear. The pound has shown little reaction, remaining mostly steady after reaching an eight-week high against the dollar yesterday. Good news! The global economy is picking up momentum, thanks to a \u201cbroad-based and synchronised improvement in growth rates\u201d. That\u2019s according to the OECD\u2019s latest economic outlook. It predicts the global economy will grow by 3.6% this year, 3.7% in 2018 and 3.6% in 2019 But there\u2019s bad news too -- Britain will lag behind other major economies over the next few years. The OECD says: In the United Kingdom, the growth slowdown is expected to continue through 2018, due to continuing uncertainty over the outcome of negotiations around the decision to leave the European Union and the impact of higher inflation on household purchasing power. So the OECD expects UK GDP to rise by 1.5% this year (down from 1.6% previously). Growth will then slow to 1.2% in 2018 (up from 1% before), and then 1.1% in 2019. In contrast, the eurozone is expected to grow by 2.4% in 2017, 2.1% in 2018, and 1.9% in 2019. Today is a very busy day for UK banking journalists, as they chew through the Bank of England\u2019s stress tests and financial stability report. These are detailed documents that deserve proper analysis. And yet... the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain\u2019s City watchdog, has decided to publish the final summary of its report into how small business owners were mistreated by Royal Bank of Scotland. This report was commissioned in 2014, and finished in October 2016. The FCA has been under pressure to publish it, following allegations that RBS had put struggling businesses into its Global Restructuring Group and then deliberately mistreated them. I can\u2019t imagine why they thought this would be a good day to release it, though.... Anyway, the final summary is online here. The inquiry has found that Royal Bank of Scotland was guilty of \u201cwidespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers\u201d. It says the bank failed to support small businesses to recover, and was too focused on raising fees to cut its own debts. RBS also failed to handle complaints properly. Some of those failings were \u201csystemic\u201d, as RBS failed to manage the\u201d conflicts of interest inherent in GRG\u2019s twin objectives\u201d (ie, helping distressed businesses, and recovering the money they owed RBS). But, the inquiry didn\u2019t accept that RBS had deliberately tried to drive firms into its GRG division so they could be pillaged. So, is this the end of the matter? Possibly not, judging by this enigmatic line in the report: The FCA has been conducting a general investigation into matters contained in the report which we announced in November 2016. We have now decided to carry out a more focussed investigation. Here\u2019s the Associated Press\u2019s take: Britain\u2019s biggest banks can withstand a series of economic shocks including a no-deal Brexit that would have more severe impacts than what they experienced during the global financial crisis, the Bank of England said on Tuesday. While concluding that lenders can deal with Britain crashing out of the European Union without a deal and restrictions imposed on British business, the Bank of England warned that additional problems may emerge if a \u201cdisorderly\u201d Brexit takes place at the same time as a sharp global recession. In its annual stress test of the sector, the central bank said the country\u2019s biggest lenders, such as Barclays and Lloyds Bank, were \u201cresilient\u201d to a raft of adverse scenarios, including deep simultaneous recessions at home and abroad and hefty falls in the price of assets. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said: \u201cDespite the severity of the tests, for the first time since the bank began stress testing in 2014, no bank needs to strengthen its capital position as a result.\u201d More here. Santander UK say they\u2019re pleased with the stress test results: Once again, Santander UK had the lowest stressed CET1 ratio impact of all participating firms, demonstrating our resilient balance sheet and low risk profile. [CET1 = Common Equity Tier 1, a measure of a bank\u2019s financial strength] Twitter have collated the best tweets about today\u2019s stress test results: Our City editor Jill Treanor reports that today\u2019s stress tests showed that the UK banking sector could survive a bad Brexit outcome: High street banks can withstand a disorderly Brexit, the Bank of England has said, even though Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays struggled in its latest health check on the sector. For the first time since 2014, when Threadneedle Street conducted its first annual stress tests, the major lenders have not been required by the UK central bank to raise billions of pounds more of capital to strengthen their finances. But RBS, 70%-owned by the taxpayer, and Barclays only passed the hurdle rate set by the Bank because the regulator took account of efforts they had already made to increase their financial strength since the end of last year, when the tests were applied. The Bank of England is alert to the risks poised by Brexit, and in its half-yearly review of risks to the financial system warns that a disorderly Brexit coupled with a severe global recession and more multibillion pound fines from global regulators could force it to reconsider its assessment. Guardian: High street banks \u2018can cope with disorderly Brexit\u2019 The Times\u2019s Katherine Griffiths points out that this year\u2019s tests were pretty tough: Britain\u2019s big banks can withstand a hard Brexit and still keep lending but Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland struggled to pass the Bank of England\u2019s latest stress tests. The seven biggest lenders passed a stress test that was as tough as if the UK crashed out of the European Union, the Bank said, with sterling slumping, interest rates rising to 4 per cent and a record housing crash. All seven lenders passed but Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland struggled. Barclays emerged with the smallest headroom. The Times: Big banks can cope with hard Brexit Over in the FT, Caroline Binham and Martin Arnold flag up that the BoE is making banks strengthen their financial positions: The Bank of England is forcing UK banks to hold an extra \u00a36bn in capital to guard against risks beyond that of Brexit, as it called on the UK and the European Union to introduce legislation to avoid a post-Brexit crisis in derivatives and insurance markets. The BoE said on Tuesday that it is raising a special buffer half a percentage point, to 1 per cent, to lock in capital that banks are currently holding voluntarily. The aim is for lenders to better withstand against \u201cmaterial\u201d macroeconomic risks beyond Brexit, such as global debt levels, asset valuations and misconduct costs. The buffer could raise again next year, the central bank warned. A disorderly Brexit is unlikely, the BoE forecasts. Financial Times: BoE demands extra \u00a36bn buffer from banks; calls for new post-Brexit derivatives rules Iain Withers of the Daily Telegraph points out that shareholders would suffer if the banks incurred hefty losses. The report showed that in the stress test scenario all but Nationwide would stop paying out a dividend within three years, and the building society would pay out just \u00a3100m. While this year\u2019s stress test did not explicitly model a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 scenario, the Bank said it was sufficiently severe to give it confidence the UK\u2019s financial system would keep lending to the real economy even in a disorderly exit from the EU. However the report warned politicians on both sides of the Channel to take several important actions to reduce the risks from Brexit, including agreeing a swift transition period and passing legislation to resolve potential contractual conflicts on trillions of pounds of derivative contracts. Telegraph: UK banks can weather chaotic Brexit but RBS and Barclays in worst shape, says Bank of England The press conference wraps up with another warning from Mark Carney that a no-deal Brexit would be undesirable for everyone involved. Q: Is the Bank of England concerned about the row at the London Stock Exchange over its leadership? Mark Carney replies that the LSE plays an important role in UK financial stability. Its CEO Xavier Rolet has made an \u201cextraordinary contribution....but everything comes to an end\u201d. Carney says he\u2019s \u201ca bit mystified\u201d by the row over Rolet\u2019s succession. [Explainer: Rolet\u2019s departure was announced last month. It has since emerged that he had been asked to step down by the board, after falling out with chairman Donald Brydon. Activist investor the Children\u2019s Investment Fund is now demanding that Brydon leaves, and Rolet stays on #developing #popcorn] Q: Are UK banks being too complacent about the impact of Fintech, by assuming they can cut costs while maintaining market share? That\u2019s the challenge, Carney replies. UK banks are assuming that they can use new technology to bring down the cost of acquiring new customers. From next year, it will be easier for customers to shift accounts. And that could mean that some banks become less \u201cfront-facing\u201d, as new challengers reshape the industry. The City has taken the stress test results in its stride. Shares in HSBC and RBS are up a little, while Barclays and Lloyds have dipped. Mary Carney is reiterating that UK banks could handle a hard Brexit -- but there could be trouble if they also faced a wider downturn. Q: Are you concerned about the state of the UK mortgage market today? Mark Carney says the FPC have put several restrictions in place in recent years, to prevent lenders from making unduly risky loans. Those measures seem to be working. Today\u2019s stress tests also found that buy-to-let mortgages would suffer the bulk of the losses if there was a financial crisis. Loans to owner-occupiers would be much more modest. In other words, families would keep paying off their mortgages even if the economy went into recession, but some buy-to-let lenders might struggle to meet their obligations. Q: Who will bear the biggest burden from a disorderly Brexit, UK households or the banks? We hope that the banks bear the burden, Carney grins. That\u2019s why they have capital reserves, to cope with tough times. The governor says: What we want...is that people who could get mortgages prior to that event can still get mortgages. If you\u2019ve got a good business ides you can still get funding post-Brexit. But at disorderly Brexit would still have an \u2018economic impact\u2019 on households and businesses. \u201cThere will be some pain associated with that\u201d, Carney concludes; the Bank\u2019s job is to dampen that pain. Q: Do regulators on the continent understand the dangers of a disorderly Brexit to the EU? Carney says there is an \u201cincreased appreciation\u201d of these issues on the continent, and the Bank is in regular contact with EU officials about these issues. He singles out the risks of cross-border insurance and derivatives contracts -- these issues can be fixed, but they take time, he says sternly. The BBC\u2019s Simon Jack nails it: Q: Will next year\u2019s stress tests include a specific test for a disorderly Brexit? No, says Mark Carney. In 12 months time it will be too late. Q: What is the impact of a disorderly Brexit on the banking sector, compared to an orderly one? Mark Carney explains that today\u2019s stress tests modelled a huge recession -- with growth slumping, unemployment tumbling, and the pound shedding a quarter of its value. Under that scenario, UK banks lose \u00a350bn of capital - but aren\u2019t sunk by those losses. So... a disorderly Brexit wouldn\u2019t be any worse than that. Carney says the Bank is putting its money where its mouth is, as it would be called on to support the UK banking scenario if Brexit goes badly. He warns: This [a disorderly Brexit] is not a good scenario... it is one we are all working to avoid as it has some quite material economic costs, even if the financial system continues to operate through it. Q: Are overseas investors already losing faith in the UK? The UK has tremendous strengths, Mark Carney replies. But you need a strong \u201cbedrock\u201d to encourage investors to keep putting money into Britain. Q: Why do you think a disorderly Brexit would be unlikely? Mark Carney says there were several reasons. That includes the fact that all parties are working towards an agreement, and have said it would be in the best interests of both sides. Governor Carney also warns that individual banks can\u2019t resolve the huge number of derivative contracts between the UK and other EU countries (totalling some \u00a320 trillion) We need secondary legislation to guarantee contract continuity - both in the UK and the EU - he adds. Onto questions...and straight into Brexit. Q: How long does a Brexit transition period need to be, and how soon to we need it? Carney says the minimum transition period is 18 to 24 months (ideally the latter), and it needs to be agreed \u201cthe sooner the better\u201d. The Bank of England also tested how UK banks would cope with the disruptive impact of Fintech. The banks themselves say they are well-positioned to cope. But the BoE reckons that new technology could have \u201cprofound consequences\u201d on incumbent banks. They include: A rise in the cost of recruiting customers, which could hit market share A rise in the cost of raising equity - which is bad for profitability. On Brexit, Mark Carney says the Bank of England focused on the scenarios that would have the biggest impact on UK stability, even if they are unlikely. And....the Financial Policy Committee judged that UK banks could continue to support the UK economy, even in the event of a disorderly exit from the EU. But.... Carney adds that banks would struggle to cope with a hard Brexit AND a global recession at the same time. If a series of \u201chighly unfortunate events happened simultaneously\u201d, capital reserves would be run down and banks would restrict lending to the real economy, the governor adds. BoE governor Mark Carney says that Britain\u2019s banks are \u201cwell-placed to provide credit to households and businesses\u201d even if they suffered recessions in the UK and abroad, large asset price falls, and hefty fines for misconduct. [reminder: here\u2019s what the tests covered] Carney confirms that that banks would lose \u00a350bn in the first two years of the scenario - enough to wipe them out 10 years ago. This time round, he says, they are strong enough to cope. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is facing Britain\u2019s (bleary eyed) banking reporters*, to discuss the stress test results. You can watch it live here: * - they\u2019ve been locked in the Bank since 5am Lloyds has issued a statement, confirming that it has passed today\u2019s stress test. Barclays has also put out a statement, which points out that its results were dragged down by the possibility of fines from banking regulators for misconduct. An element of the 5.0% drawdown in the BoE\u2019s 2017 stress test reflects litigation and conduct issues which Barclays is aiming to resolve. Barclays continues to target an end state CET1 ratio of around 13%, although it may temporarily run above that level until these legacy issues are resolved. Standard Chartered says that it \u2018notes\u2019 it has passed today\u2019s stress tests, adding; The Group has a strong and liquid balance sheet and these results demonstrate the benefits of the actions recently undertaken by the Group to improve its resilience to an extreme stress scenario. Reaction to today\u2019s press conference is flooding in. Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s CEO, Ewen Stevenson, says his company is making progress, but admits it has more work to do. \u201cWe continue to make progress towards the stress resilient bank we aspire to be. 2017 represented another year of material improvement with our peak-to-trough stress resilience improving by 300bps from last year\u2019s stress test. Until we have resolved our remaining major legacy conduct issues and non-core portfolio interests, we will continue to show stress test results weaker than our long term targets.\u201d This chart shows how Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays failed to meet the pass mark in today\u2019s stress tests, based on their end\u20112016 capital positions. But... they still passed today\u2019s tests, because they have bolstered their capital positions during 2017. The 2017 UK bank stress tests are online, here. The BoE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, set up to assess risks to the financial system, had judged that: The UK banking system could continue to support the real economy through a disorderly Brexit. However the combination of a disorderly Brexit and a severe global recession and stressed misconduct costs could result in more severe conditions than in the stress test,\u201d the Bank said. Threadneedle Street confirmed that banks would be required to hold an extra \u00a311.4bn in capital by next November, but will now review whether they will need to build an additional cushion in the future in light of the potential risks in the system. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said: The FPC is taking action to ensure the financial system is resilient to a very broad range of risks so that the people of the United Kingdom can move forward with confidence that they can access the financial services they will need to seize the opportunities ahead\u201d. Here\u2019s the official confirmation that Britain\u2019s banks have enough capital to withstand a new financial crisis. Importantly, the Bank of England has also found that Britain\u2019s banks could cope with a \u201cdisorderly\u201d Brexit without having to curb lending or be bailed out by taxpayers. Here we go! Britain\u2019s seven largest lenders have passed the tough stress test posed by the Bank of England. This is the first clean slate since the tests were created in 2014, and suggests the sector is in relatively decent shape to survive the next recession. BUT! Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland only passed because they have raised fresh capital during the course of 2017. More to follow! Today\u2019s stress tests model the \u201cdoomsday\u201d scenario for Britain\u2019s banks, says Business Insider\u2019s Will Martin. And here it is: In the UK economy, the BoE modelled the effects of a sharp recession of more than -4% GDP. This is accompanied by the pound collapsing to just $0.85, a fall of about a third from current values. Global growth is also hit, with banks tested on how they would cope with a worldwide contraction of 2.4%. This scenario also includes a collapse in Chinese commercial real estate of more than 40%. As a result, unemployment in the UK climbs higher than during the financial crisis. Commercial lending collapses, leading to disaster in the property market. House prices fall by 33% and commercial real estate loses 40% of its value. The Daily Telegraph\u2019s Iain Withers compares today\u2019s stress tests to classic computer game Sim City..... He writes: Fans of the blockbuster Nineties PC title SimCity 2000 will remember it as a fiendishly addictive city management game. Players built roads, homes, offices, shops, factories and utilities in what proved a surprisingly popular simulation of life as a city mayor. Sometimes the game would suddenly trash your city with an alien invasion, to test your mettle. A massive black metal spider-like creature would pop up on the screen and start razing parts of your lovingly crafted metropolis with laser beams. There was little you could do other than hunker down, wait for the alien to leave, put out the fires and rebuild. I fear today\u2019s test may not be quite as much fun, though Good morning. We\u2019re about to discover if Britain\u2019s banking sector is strong enough to survive a new financial crisis. Bank of England has put the UK\u2019s seven biggest lenders through a series of rigorous tests to see how they\u2019d cope if the economy hit the rocks. The BoE\u2019s stress tests model a serious financial downturn, at home and abroad. They examine if banks have enough capital to handle a sharp fall in UK and global growth, a surge in consumer bad debts, a plunge in the pound, and a jump in unemployment caused by higher interest rates. It will also test their long-term financial resilience. The seven lenders are Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Santander\u2019s UK operations, and the Nationwide building society. The results are released at 7am GMT, and will show which banks are best, and least, prepared for the next recession. Banks whose exam paper comes back covered in red ink will face tough questions about their resilience. Any lender who actually fails the test forced to sell off assets or ask existing shareholders and bondholders for more cash. Last year Royal Bank of Scotland fell short, so it\u2019ll be under particular scrutiny this year. A poor performance could undermine the UK government\u2019s attempt to sell its majority stake in RBS. We already know that the lenders will suffer \u00a330bn of losses on consumer loans under the tests. Today\u2019s results will show where those losses are concentrated. Adding to the fun, the Bank of England is also releasing its latest Financial Stability Report this morning. That will show the BoE\u2019s view of the UK financial system, and the key threats to financial stability. Our City editor Jill Treanor is locked in the Bank of England, reading the stress test now ahead of 7am. Here\u2019s her preview: Here\u2019s the agenda 7am GMT: UK bank stress tests released 7.30am GMT: Bank of England governor Mark Carney holds a press conference. He\u2019ll discuss the stress test results and the BoE\u2019s financial stability report 10am GMT: OECD releases its latest economic outlook 1.30pm GMT: US trade balance for October 2.45pm GMT: Federal Reserve chair nominee Jay Powell\u2019s confirmation hearing at the US Senate",

      "bodyText": "A partly British-built hybrid electric plane could be flying by 2020 as the result of a collaboration between Airbus, Siemens and Rolls-Royce. The manufacturers will convert a short-haul passenger jet, paving the way to making commercial air travel running partly on electricity a reality. Engineers involved in the E-Fan X project said the technology could mean cleaner, quieter and cheaper journeys. They also raised the prospect of radically changing aircraft and airport design, allowing air travel to supplant rail for many more intercity journeys. The companies are in talks with the British government to partially fund the joint project, which could cost hundreds of millions of pounds. They aim to build an E-Fan X demonstration model based on a BAe 146 aircraft in which an electric unit, powered by an onboard generator, replaces one, and eventually two, of the plane\u2019s four gas turbine engines. Airbus flew a single-seater electric plane, the E-Fan, across the Channel in 2015. The E-Fan X passenger jet will require more than 30 times the power, two megawatts, for a single electric engine. Mark Cousins, the head of flight demonstrators at Airbus, said: \u201cWe decided we needed to be more ambitious because the world and technology is moving so fast.\u201d A number of airlines were interested, he said. \u201cThe objective is to reduce environmental impact and significantly reduce fuel burn.\u201d Paul Stein, the Rolls-Royce chief technology officer, said: \u201cAviation has been the last frontier in the electrification of transport, and slow to catch up. This will be a new era of aviation.\u201d Electric motors, which can be tilted more easily, could lead to radical changes in overall plane design. Quieter and cleaner travel could also mean airports situated much nearer city centres and, particularly in the developing world, less need to build or maintain infrastructure such as rail lines, Stein said. \u201cIt has the potential to move mass transport from rail to air; flying might become the norm.\u201d For now, challenges include accommodating the weight of a two-tonne battery storing electricity onboard a small plane. Frank Anton, the head of eAircraft at Siemens, said: \u201cWe have to get more than 10 times the power out of the same weight.\u201d However, Anton said he believed he would one day buy tickets for short-haul commercial flights using hybrid electric planes. The addition of Rolls -Royce to the Airbus-Siemens collaboration will step up the race to transform gas turbine aircraft. Earlier this year, easyJet said it hoped to be flying planes powered by batteries rather than jet fuel within a decade on shorter flights. The airline has signed a deal with the US engineering company Wright Electric to support the development of electric aircraft that could reach Paris and Amsterdam from London. Carolyn McCall, easyJet\u2019s departing chief executive, said it was \u201ca matter of when, not if, a short-haul electric plane will fly\u201d. Wright Electric has operated a two-seater prototype but hopes to develop a single aisle, commercial plane able to carry 120 passengers. Another US company, Zunum Aero, backed by Boeing, is building a 12-seater hybrid electric plane that it claims could hugely reduce operating costs for private jets. It has said the planes will be ready by 2022. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also widened the scope of its probe to include controversial sales tactics used by ticket resale websites, which allow touts to resell seats at gigs by popular acts such as Adele and Ed Sheeran in return for a cut of the profit. Any that do not comply with the CMA\u2019s demands to abide by consumer protection laws could be fined or taken to court, the regulator said, promising to use the \u201cfull range of our powers\u201d. The CMA opened its investigation last year amid mounting pressure from the music industry and fans\u2019 groups to address concerns about ticket resale, an industry dominated by StubHub, Viagogo, GetMeIn and Seatwave. In an update on its progress, the regulator said it would demand that resale companies make clear whether tickets had terms and conditions attached that could result in buyers being denied entry to an event. Ticket firms will also be told to make clear who is selling the tickets, which could lead to some of the UK\u2019s biggest professional touts having to provide more detail about their identities.

This will include looking into the use of pressure selling, to see whether \u201cclaims made about the availability and popularity of tickets create a misleading impression or rush customers into making a buying decision\u201d. Officials will look at the difficulty faced by customers in getting their money back under a website\u2019s guarantee, after the Guardian revealed that Viagogo customers struggled to get refunds after being overcharged. The CMA also promised to investigate \u201cspeculative selling\u201d, where websites advertise tickets they do not yet own and may not able to supply.

    "webTitle": "High street banks 'can cope with disorderly Brexit'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "High street banks can withstand a disorderly Brexit, the Bank of England has said, even though Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays struggled in its latest health check on the sector. For the first time since 2014, when Threadneedle Street conducted its first annual stress tests, the major lenders have not been required by the UK central bank to raise billions of pounds more of capital to strengthen their finances. But RBS, 70%-owned by the taxpayer, and Barclays only passed the hurdle rate set by the Bank because the regulator took account of efforts they had already made to increase their financial strength since the end of last year, when the tests were applied. The Bank of England is alert to the risks poised by Brexit, and in its half-yearly review of risks to the financial system warns that a disorderly Brexit coupled with a severe global recession and more multibillion pound fines from global regulators could force it to reconsider its assessment. The seven lenders subjected to the test \u2013 which also include HSBC, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, the UK arm of Santander and Nationwide Building Society \u2013 would incur \u00a350bn of losses under the hypothetical scenario imposed on their financial position at the end of 2016. Losses on this scale would have wiped out bank capital 10 years ago. This scenario included a 4.7% fall in UK GDP, a 33% fall in house prices, interest rates rising to 4% and a 27% fall in the pound. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said this was a worst-case scenario of what could happen if the UK crashed out of the EU and would cause some pain. \u201cThis is not a good scenario; it\u2019s a scenario that we are all trying to avoid because it has some quite material economic costs even if financial system continues to function through it,\u201d Carney said. However, he added that a disorderly Brexit was an \u201cunlikely event\u201d as the UK government and EU leaders had said it was in no one\u2019s interest for the UK to leave the EU without a transition deal. \u201cOur predisposition is to expect we will continue to have a highly cooperative relationship with Europe,\u201d said Carney, adding the Bank\u2019s job was to prepare for the worst. The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC), set up to assess risks to the financial system, had judged that \u201cthe UK banking system could continue to support the real economy through a disorderly Brexit\u201d. Carney said, though, that the question the sector faced was something else happening at the same time, such as a global recession or more fines for misconduct. Banks would be required to hold an extra \u00a36bn in capital by next November, but the BoE will review whether they will need to build an additional cushion in light of the potential risks in the UK banking system. The Bank has already warned that the banking sector could incur \u00a330bn-worth of losses on consumer credit \u2013 credit cards, personal loans and car finance \u2013 if interest rates and unemployment rose sharply. On Tuesday, the Bank revealed that losses on mortgage lending would reach \u00a317bn and that more borrowers would run into difficulty maintaining their payments as a result of significant rises in interest rates. It has assumed a further \u00a340bn of fines on top of \u00a360bn already incurred since the financial crisis. It added: \u201cThe FPC continues to assess the risks of disruption to UK financial services arising from Brexit so that preparations can be made and action taken to mitigate against them.\u201d Bank officials have already warned about the need for a Brexit transition deal by Christmas. In its latest risk assessment it set out a checklist to be addressed to avoid chaos in the UK financial sector when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. It included: \u2022 The need for a UK legal framework \u2022 \u201cTimely agreement\u201d on a transition deal \u2022 \u00a326tn of derivatives contracts could be at risk and 36m insurance policies for households in the UK and EU \u2022 160 banks and insurance companies in the European Economic Area need authorisation to operate in the UK from the Bank, which will set out its approach to regulation by the end of the year. For the first time the viability of UK banks\u2019 financial health and business models were also tested against a longer-term scenario of seven years of weak global growth, low interest rates and high legal costs and fines for misconduct. The Bank said that this test had found that lenders would take the axe to costs \u2013 possibly by cutting jobs \u2013 to deal with the rise of fintech firms. The results of the stress tests will be closely watched by the Treasury, which said it wanted to sell off \u00a315bn of its stake in RBS, which is worth about two-thirds of the bank\u2019s value, even though this would leave taxpayers with a \u00a326bn loss. RBS shares were little moved on the stress test results although Barclays fell 1% as its chief executive, Jes Staley, hopes to start increasing the dividend after cutting it for the last two years. Lloyds shares were also down after it fared worse than in last year\u2019s stress test. Under the stress scenario, none of the banks pays dividends or bonuses during the period. Next year\u2019s stress tests would not involve a \u201chard\u201d Brexit test, as Carney said it would be too late by then. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

They are based on hypothetical scenarios but designed with historic events in mind, such as the Black Monday stock market crash in 1987 or the banking crisis of 2008. In the 1990s, banks devised their own tests and used them to measure the impact on their trading positions. But the fallout from the banking crisis has given them more prominence, and illustrates why we need them. Banks collapsed in 2008 because they did not have the financial strength to withstand their losses. In 2014, the Bank of England&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/14/britains-bank-stress-tests\">began annual stress tests on the biggest lenders</a>, publishing the scenarios that would be used and publishing the results. Each bank has its own pass rate \u2013 and if they fail can be required to find more capital.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But RBS, 70%-owned by the taxpayer, and Barclays only passed the hurdle rate set by the Bank because the regulator took account of efforts they had already made to increase their financial strength since the end of last year, when the tests were applied.</p> \n<p>The Bank of England is alert to the risks poised by Brexit, and in <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/fsr/2017/nov.aspx\">its half-yearly review of risks to the financial system</a> warns that a disorderly Brexit coupled with a severe global recession and more multibillion pound fines from global regulators could force it to reconsider its assessment.</p> \n<p>The seven lenders subjected to the test \u2013 which also include HSBC, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, the UK arm of Santander and Nationwide Building Society \u2013 would incur \u00a350bn of losses under the hypothetical scenario imposed on their financial position at the end of 2016. Losses on this scale would have wiped out bank capital 10 years ago.</p> \n<p>This scenario included a 4.7% fall in UK GDP, a 33% fall in house prices, interest rates rising to 4% and a 27% fall in the pound.</p> \n<p>Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said this was a worst-case scenario of what could happen if the UK crashed out of the EU and would cause some pain. </p> \n<p>\u201cThis is not a good scenario; it\u2019s a scenario that we are all trying to avoid because it has some quite material economic costs even if financial system continues to function through it,\u201d Carney said.<br></p> \n<p>However, he added that a disorderly Brexit was an \u201cunlikely event\u201d as the UK government and EU leaders had said it was in no one\u2019s interest for the UK to leave the EU without a transition deal.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur predisposition is to expect we will continue to have a highly cooperative relationship with Europe,\u201d said Carney, adding the Bank\u2019s job was to prepare for the worst. </p> \n<p>The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC), set up to assess risks to the financial system, had judged that \u201cthe UK banking system could continue to support the real economy through a disorderly Brexit\u201d.</p> \n<p>Carney said, though, that the question the sector faced was something else happening at the same time, such as a global recession or more fines for misconduct.</p> \n<p>Banks would be required to hold an extra \u00a36bn in capital by next November, but the BoE will review whether they will need to build an additional cushion in light of the potential risks in the UK banking system.</p> \n<p>The Bank has already warned that the banking sector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/25/bank-of-england-warns-a-consumer-debt-crisis-could-cost-banks-30bn\">could incur \u00a330bn-worth of losses on consumer credit</a> \u2013 credit cards, personal loans and car finance \u2013 if interest rates and unemployment rose sharply.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, the Bank revealed that losses on mortgage lending would reach \u00a317bn and that more borrowers would run into difficulty maintaining their payments as a result of significant rises in interest rates. It has assumed a further \u00a340bn of fines on top of \u00a360bn already incurred since the financial crisis.</p> \n<p>It added: \u201cThe FPC continues to assess the risks of disruption to UK financial services arising from Brexit so that preparations can be made and action taken to mitigate against them.\u201d<br></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/17/time-running-out-brexit-transition-deal-bank-england-mark-carney-mps\">Bank officials have already warned</a> about the need for a Brexit transition deal by Christmas. In its latest risk assessment it set out a checklist to be addressed to avoid chaos in the UK financial sector when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. It included:</p> \n<p>\u2022 The need for a UK legal framework <br>\u2022 \u201cTimely agreement\u201d on a transition deal<br>\u2022 \u00a326tn of derivatives contracts could be at risk and 36m insurance policies for households in the UK and EU<br>\u2022 160 banks and insurance companies in the European Economic Area need authorisation to operate in the UK from the Bank, which will set out its approach to regulation by the end of the year.</p> \n<p>For the first time the viability of UK banks\u2019 financial health and business models were also tested against a longer-term scenario of seven years of weak global growth, low interest rates and high legal costs and fines for misconduct.</p> \n<p>The Bank said that this test had found that lenders would take the axe to costs \u2013 possibly by cutting jobs \u2013 to deal with the rise of fintech firms.<br></p> \n<p>The results of the stress tests will be closely watched by the Treasury, which said it wanted to sell off \u00a315bn of its stake in RBS, which is worth about two-thirds of the bank\u2019s value, even though this would leave taxpayers with a \u00a326bn loss. <br></p> \n<p>RBS shares were little moved on the stress test results although Barclays fell 1% as its chief executive, Jes Staley, hopes to start increasing the dividend after cutting it for the last two years. Lloyds shares were also down after it fared worse than in last year\u2019s stress test.</p> \n<p>Under the stress scenario, none of the banks pays dividends or bonuses during the period.<br></p> \n<p>Next year\u2019s stress tests would not involve a \u201chard\u201d Brexit test, as Carney said it would be too late by then.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"429bf79f-6464-4031-ab4b-8259195dfc34\" data-atom-type=\"storyquestions\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Storyquestions\">\n    <ul>\n     <li>What are the stress tests and how do they work?</li>\n     <li>How realistic is the scenario set by the Bank of England?</li>\n     <li>What do the results mean for the government?</li>\n    </ul>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from October 2006 to May 2011 The UK economy continues to grow \u2013 as the chancellor pointed out in his budget speech. But we have moved from the fast lane of Europe and the global economy to the slow lane over the past 18 months. UK GDP is up by just 1.5% on a year ago. We are now bottom of the G7 growth league \u2013 behind the traditional laggards, Japan and Italy. We cannot blame the global economy for this disappointing performance. Our sluggish growth is mainly due to the weakness of consumer spending \u2013 which has been squeezed by inflation and a depreciated pound \u2013 and investment uncertainty. Business investment rose by just 1.3% in the past 12 months, just a third of the average rate of growth (3.9%) recorded in the three years 2013-2015. The chancellor\u2019s budget sought to inject a bit of much-needed momentum into the UK economy, to counter the very downbeat forecasts he received from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). He has relaxed the purse-strings in a number of areas of public spending, and has provided a limited boost to consumer spending by raising personal tax allowances and relieving stamp duty for first-time buyers. But for the economy as a whole, the budget provides little support to growth. In 2018-2019, the tax burden (total taxes as a percentage of GDP) is projected to be the highest recorded for nearly 50 years, and is expected to reach the second highest level we have seen in the UK since at least the 1950s. The chancellor missed the opportunity to undertake any serious tax reform, and he delivered a \u201cbits and pieces\u201d budget with a wide range of small measures likely to have little impact on the economy over the medium-term. After being one of the strongest-performing western economies in the 1990s and 2000s, the UK now finds itself in a weak position at a time when the world economy is growing strongly. The outlook for growth announced by the OBR is the weakest we have seen since the end of the second world war, outside of periods of recession. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the Brexit process \u2013 which has added to investment uncertainty and squeezed consumers \u2013 is the main reason why the British economy is underperforming so badly at the moment. David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from June 2006 to May 2009 That was the budget that wasn\u2019t. There was a little fiddling at the edges; the cut in stamp duty designed to help first-time buyers amounted to nothing as it would cause house prices to rise and wipe out any benefit. In the end, it would help only existing homeowners. Same, old, same old, in terms of austerity with more cuts still to come for years ahead. Not unrelated to that was the downgrade in the OBR\u2019s forecast of productivity growth and consequently economic growth. GDP per head was downgraded by a cumulative 1.9% between now and 2021. GDP growth forecast for 2017 is now a derisory 1.5%; 1.4% in 2018; 1.3% in both 2019 and 2020; 1.5% in 2021 and 1.6% in 2022. No other chancellor has ever had to report such a dreadful growth forecast for so long. As a result the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that by 2021 average earnings are set to be \u00a31,400 lower than the government had predicted they were going to be. The Resolution Foundation said British people are now set to suffer their longest sustained period of falling living standards since records began in the 1950s. But it could even be a lot worse than that. First, the OBR has assumed that the Brexit negotiations go smoothly, and there is every indication that this is unduly optimistic. Discussions over the Irish border question are not going well and are adding to the uncertainty that firms are facing because the uncertainty over the apparently stalled negotiations. Second, the OBR is still assuming there is a major pick-up in productivity very soon compared with the average that has prevailed since the Great Recession. They provide no evidence to support the possibility of any pick-up at all, especially as investment is being held due to the enhanced levels of uncertainty. There is no reason at all, in my view, to believe any take-off in productivity will happen any time soon given they have assumed a surge in every one of their forecasts since June 2010. If either of these two concerns happen, the economy could grow much more slowly than even the OBR\u2019s horrid forecasts. I am still waiting for any good news from Brexit. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Pound rises and falls after rate hike and resignations Sterling has bounced around in recent weeks, rising and falling on foreign exchanges due to Bank of England actions and concerns over the stability of Theresa May\u2019s government prompted by two cabinet resignations \u2013 ultimately ending the month pretty much where it started. The first rate hike in a decade by Threadneedle Street received a cool reception from City traders who doubt whether the central bank will raise the cost of borrowing much further in the near future. The pound fell almost 2% against the dollar when it raised rates from 0.25% to 0.5% on 2 November, although it has since recovered almost all the lost ground. Sterling remains more than 10% down against the dollar since the EU referendum in June 2016. FTSE 100 slips from record high last month The leading index of blue-chip shares has slipped in recent weeks after closing at a record high last month, falling by more than 1% as sterling recovers ground against other major currencies. The pound\u2019s weakness is the FTSE 100\u2019s strength because companies in the index are typically global firms, which make significant sums of money in foreign currencies. Therefore a weak pound increases their bottom line and thus their stock prices. When sterling rises, as it has done in recent weeks, the opposite happens. The FTSE 250 list, which has more companies rooted in the UK economy, has also fallen by about 1% over the past month. Better than forecast Inflation holds steady despite rising food costs Against expectations from the Bank of England for the squeeze on households to intensify last month, the rate of inflation remained steady in October compared with September. Still, the consumer price index (CPI) stood at 3%, the highest level in five years, driven by the higher cost of importing food to the UK after the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote. Food prices were up by 4.2% on 12 months earlier, a sharp increase on the 0.6% that food inflation was running at just a year ago. Retailers are likely to be troubled by the figures in the run-up to Christmas, with the high cost of buying presents and food likely to eat into the ability of consumers to splash out. Better than forecast UK\u2019s trade deficit narrows thanks to EU boost Hopes that the weak pound since the referendum would increase exports, giving an economic uplift to offset a downturn in consumer spending, were given a boost last month as the gap between what Britain imports and exports fell to \u00a32.75bn in September, better than expected. That was an improvement on a trade gap of \u00a33.45bn in August. However, the figures show greater export volumes to the EU as the trade deficit widens with the rest of the world. Exports to non-EU countries fell by \u00a31.7bn, while exports to the EU increased by \u00a3900m, which analysts attributed to the eurozone\u2019s economic recovery. Better than forecast Key industries signal stronger economic growth Key barometers of management sentiment about business activity brought mixed news in October. While optimism among firms slipped to a 15-month low and job creation slowed, there was an upturn in activity pointing to the strongest economic growth for six months. Services, the UK\u2019s biggest sector, recorded a big improvement from September. The Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for the sector came in at 55.6 in October, beating analyst expectations, rising from 53.6 in September. Manufacturers reported higher prices for goods used in the production process, eroding the benefit from the weakness in the pound when selling abroad. But the gauge of factory output came in at 56.3, above estimates and slightly better than the 56 level recorded in September. The PMI measures, where anything above 50 indicates expansion, are tracked for early clues on official GDP figures. Worse than forecast Deficit gives Hammond a budget headache Britain\u2019s deficit widened unexpectedly last month, causing a headache for Philip Hammond, with the figures released a day before the budget. Public sector net borrowing, excluding the nationalised banks, grew by \u00a3500m to \u00a38bn in October when compared with the same month a year ago. City economists had expected the deficit, which is the gap between government spending and tax receipts, to improve by \u00a3500m to stand at \u00a37bn. The wider deficit was fuelled by the government paying more on debt linked to the rate of inflation \u2013 which has soared in recent months due to the Brexit-induced fall in sterling. Despite the deterioration in October, previous months have been better than expected, meaning that for the first seven months of 2017 the deficit has fallen by \u00a34.1bn to \u00a338.5bn, making 2017 so far the best start to the year in a decade. Better than forecast Britain\u2019s jobs boom shows signs of slowing The first signs that Britain\u2019s jobs boom of recent years is coming to an end emerged in the past month, as figures from the Office for National Statistics show a 14,000 fall in the number in work in the three months to September \u2013 the first decline since April 2013. Meanwhile, average weekly earnings excluding bonuses were 2.2% higher in the same period \u2013 no change on the upwardly revised figures for the period ending in August. That was slightly better than City expectations for wages to rise by 2.1%. Better than forecast Retail sales see first annual decline since 2013 High street sales bounced back in October, gaining by 0.3% compared with a monthly drop of 0.7% in September, beating expectations. Still, on an annual basis the UK recorded its first year-on-year drop in consumer spending since 2013, illustrating the pressure facing households from the rising cost of living. The uptick in inflation helped push the volume of goods bought in shops and online down by 0.3% from October 2016. Economists will be looking at the key Christmas shopping period ahead to gauge the resilience of consumer spending, which is a key driver for the health of the economy. Worse than forecast Clouds gather over the housing market The latest monthly snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) show Britain\u2019s housing market has stalled, with fewer people looking to buy a new home and prices barely rising across the UK. The survey of property professionals found only 1% who expect house prices will rise nationally, down from 6% in September, which fell short of forecasts by City economists for a balance of 4%. Interest from buyers continued to drop, with 20% more surveyors reporting a fall in new buyer inquiries than an increase. Nearly two-thirds of surveyors reported a drop in prices over the month \u2013 the poorest reading since the depth of the financial crisis in 2009. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 English citizens are happier since the Brexit vote Despite research showing British households are each more than \u00a3600 a year worse off after the vote to leave the EU, rising inflation, low wage growth and political turmoil, England is now officially happier than ever before a year after the Brexit vote. Key barometers of happiness and wellbeing measured by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed small improvements over the year to the end of June \u2013 the first 12-month period since the referendum. But even though there was an increase in England, there was no change in reported personal wellbeing recorded in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Perhaps most surprisingly \u2013 given terror attacks this year and an election that led one woman from Bristol to cry \u201cnot another one!\u201d \u2013 the ONS found no change in anxiety levels compared with a year ago. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The first rate hike in a decade by Threadneedle Street received a cool reception from City traders who doubt whether the central bank will raise the cost of borrowing much further in the near future. The pound fell almost 2% against the dollar when it raised rates from 0.25% to 0.5% on 2 November, although it has since recovered almost all the lost ground.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy is showing signs of coming through the worst of its 2017 slowdown, according to a Guardian analysis, as exporters benefit from an improving global economy and inflation remained steady. In the week after Chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s budget outlined the biggest growth downgrade for the UK since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic indicators nonetheless shows Britain\u2019s immediate economic situation to be an improvement on earlier this year. The country has kept on an even keel as exporters were bolstered by growth in global trade, while the improvement in the outlook for the rest of the world is helping to offset weakness at home. Households continue to feel the squeeze from inflation, prompted by the weak pound since the Brexit vote, but the rate at which prices rose in the UK stayed at 3% despite expectations of a further increase. Still, questions remain over the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with Europe, while Hammond\u2019s budget revealed a forecast for a slowdown in economic growth for the years to come. The OECD confirmed the downbeat long-term outlook on Tuesday as its latest assessment of the global economy put the UK at the bottom of the G7 growth table for next year - and only just keeping ahead of Japan as the worst performer in 2019. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said the chancellor\u2019s \u201cbits and pieces\u201d budget would do little to improve the health of the economy over the medium-term. \u201cIt is hard to avoid the conclusion that the Brexit process \u2013 which has added to investment uncertainty and squeezed consumers \u2013 is the main reason why the British economy is underperforming so badly at the moment,\u201d he said. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in five cases the outcome was better than expected. The latest dashboard shows Britain cut its trade deficit with the rest of the world in October, as the weak pound makes UK-manufactured goods more attractive to foreign buyers. That will steady the nerves of businesses fearing a slowdown in demand for their goods owing to uncertainty over tariffs and border controls that could be enforced when the UK leaves the EU in 2019. The latest figures show the gap between what Britain imports and exports fell to \u00a32.75bn in September, a better result than forecast by City economists. Ministers may be concerned, however, that the improvement was down to better export sales to the EU, while trade with the rest of the world declined. Over the last month, key barometers of sentiment among companies about business activity pointed to the strongest economic growth for half a year, even as optimism among firms about the future evaporated to the lowest levels seen in 15 months. The Markit/CIPS purchasing mangers\u2019 index (PMI) for the country\u2019s key services sector recorded a big jump in October, coming in at 55.6 from 53.6 a month earlier. The PMI measures, where anything above 50 indicates expansion, are tracked for early clues on official GDP figures. There was more positive news for squeezed British households, facing almost two decades without pay returning above pre-financial crisis levels, that inflation held steady in October \u2013 against expectations from the Bank of England for a rise. Cheaper fuel and deep discounting by retailers cancelled out the impact of surging food prices to leave the consumer price index (CPI) at 3% for the second consecutive month. High street sales also beat City expectations by bouncing back in October, gaining by 0.3% compared with a monthly drop of 0.7% seen in September. Still, on an annual basis the UK recorded its first year-on-year drop in consumer spending since 2013, illustrating the pressures facing households from the rising cost of living. Economists will be looking at the key Christmas shopping period ahead as well as the outcome of the Black Friday discounting period in November to gauge the resilience of consumer spending, which is a key driver for the health of the economy. Official figures appear to show England becoming a happier place in the year since the Brexit vote \u2013 despite research showing that households are now each \u00a3600 a year worse off after the referendum. Measures for happiness and wellbeing showed no change for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But there are worrying signals for the road ahead. Hammond revealed at the budget a painful downgrade in economic growth of around half a percentage point annually in the coming years. Jobs figures showed the first fall in the number of people in work since 2013 in the three months to September, in the first signs that the employment boom of recent years could be coming to an end. There was no change in the jobless rate in the latest figures, staying at the lowest levels since 1975. However, the low jobless rate is still having little impact on the wages of British workers, despite expectations for their bargaining power to demand higher pay and better working conditions to improve. There was no increase for the annual rate of earnings growth, remaining at 2.2% in the three months ending in September from the same level for the period ending in August. Still, the strong levels of employment growth in the earlier months of this year have been positive for the public finances, with the Treasury raking in more money from taxes than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for the year to the end of October. But rising inflation has also pushed up the cost of debt interest paid by the government \u2013 leading to a worse than expected performance for the public finances last month. There are questions about the strength of the economy over the coming months, after some business leaders have suggested failure to agree a transitional deal to smooth Britain\u2019s exit from the EU over several years after the end of article 50 talks by the end of 2017, or early 2018 at the latest, will force them to alter their investment decisions or move staff to other countries. The government is mired in talks over the Irish border, while ministers must also make sufficient progress on a financial settlement with Brussels to leave the EU as well as reach an agreement over the rights of EU citizens in the UK. The OBR did not factor in failure to reach a deal over Brexit into its gloomy forecasts for the health of the economy alongside the budget. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, another former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC, said this was \u201cunduly optimistic\u201d, adding that deadlock will put business investment on hold. This in turn will limit productivity growth in the UK \u2013 which the OBR estimates will pick-up over the coming five years, albeit at a slower pace than forecast. \u201cThere is no reason at all, in my view, to believe any take-off in productivity will happen any time soon,\u201d said Blanchflower, adding: \u201cThe economy could grow much more slowly than even the OBR\u2019s horrid forecasts. I am still waiting for any good news from Brexit.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The OECD confirmed the downbeat long-term outlook on Tuesday as its latest assessment of the global economy put the UK at the bottom of the G7 growth table for next year - and only just keeping ahead of Japan as the worst performer in 2019. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/28/brexit-has-bumped-us-from-the-fast-lane-to-the-slow-lane-experts-debate-the-data\">Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance</a>, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said the chancellor\u2019s \u201cbits and pieces\u201d budget would do little to improve the health of the economy over the medium-term. </p> <p> \u201cIt is hard to avoid the conclusion that the Brexit process \u2013 which has added to investment uncertainty and squeezed consumers \u2013 is the main reason why the British economy is underperforming so badly at the moment,\u201d he said. </p> <p>To gauge the impact of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100.

Ministers may be concerned, however, that the improvement was down to better export sales to the EU, while trade with the rest of the world declined.</p> <p>Over the last month, key barometers of sentiment among companies about business activity pointed to the strongest economic growth for half a year, even as optimism among firms about the future evaporated to the lowest levels seen in 15 months. <a href=\"https://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/PressRelease.mvc/dbc7e65e9c234a4985ceeeaf3b21215f?s=1\">The Markit/CIPS purchasing mangers\u2019 index</a> (PMI) for the country\u2019s key services sector recorded a big jump in October, coming in at 55.6 from 53.6 a month earlier. The PMI measures, where anything above 50 indicates expansion, are tracked for early clues on official GDP figures.</p> <p>There was more positive news for squeezed British households, facing almost two decades without pay returning above pre-financial crisis levels, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/14/post-brexit-vote-surge-uk-inflation-may-have-peaked-3-percent\">inflation held steady in October \u2013 against expectations from the Bank of England for a rise</a>.</p> <p>Cheaper fuel and deep discounting by retailers cancelled out the impact of surging food prices to leave the consumer price index (CPI) at 3% for the second consecutive month. </p> <p>High street sales also beat City expectations by bouncing back in October, gaining by 0.3% compared with a monthly drop of 0.7% seen in September.

      "bodyText": "Shell has doubled its spending on clean power and bowed to shareholder pressure by promising to halve the carbon footprint of the energy it sells by 2050, as the oil giant said it was stepping up its ambitions on green energy. The Anglo Dutch firm is increasing capital expenditure for its new energies division, to $1bn-$2bn (\u00a3750m to \u00a31.5bn) a year for 2018-2020, up from a previous plan of up to $1bn a year by 2020. But the spending on wind power, biofuels and electric car infrastructure will still account for a small fraction of the giant\u2019s planned $25-30bn annual investment. Shell has $5bn-$6bn a year pegged for deepwater drilling and $2-3bn a year allocated for shale oil and gas. The company\u2019s new climate change target aims to cut the net carbon footprint of its products in half by 2050, and around one-fifth by 2035. \u201cIt is making sure that the products within society have an overall lower carbon footprint. That is the longterm way of making sure our business remains a relevant business in the face of the energy transition,\u201d said Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive. The carbon target is similar to one put forward by shareholder activists at the company\u2019s AGM earlier this year, which the board opposed and defeated. Shell said the goal addressed the spirit of the shareholders\u2019 proposal but the company\u2019s chosen methodology meant it did not have \u201cnegative side-effects\u201d of the resolution. \u201cWe could see a kernel of truth and relevance in there,\u201d said Van Beurden. The Dutch activist shareholder group behind the proposal, Follow This, welcomed the new target. \u201cWe applaud Shell\u2019s ambitious decision to take leadership in achieving the goals of the Paris climate agreement to limit global warming to well below 2C,\u201d said the group\u2019s founder, Mark van Baal. Shell said it would grow its new energies division through its existing businesses and by acquiring companies, as it has done recently by buying electric car charging firms Ionity and New Motion. Van Beurden defended the level of spending on green energy. \u201cIs the investment we are going to put in new energies enough? Let\u2019s see, we have to start somewhere,\u201d he said. Wind and biofuels would have a key role, he said. \u201cWe will systematically improve, we will grow this business up to be a very significant part of the future of the company, otherwise you can\u2019t even get to a 20% reduction of a carbon footprint. \u201cBut we have to do it in a disciplined way. If we destroy value in this process, no one is going to be served.\u201d However, the company said hydrocarbons would still be at the heart of its business and the global energy landscape over the next two decades. \u201cOil and gas will remain an important part of the energy system [up to 2030], no credible forecast says otherwise,\u201d said Van Beurden. On the idea that some of its assets would be stranded by governments taking action on carbon emissions as part of the Paris climate deal, he said: \u201cI think we will have very limited, if any, stranded assets [in the 2020s].\u201d The chief executive said that the firm sees underlying reasons that the oil price could go even higher than where it stands now, at just over $60 per barrel, but in the meantime the price could be unpredictable. \u201cI think we will see an era of volatility,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cYou may argue the fundamentals point to a slightly higher oil price than we see at the moment.\u201d As expected, Shell also announced it was would begin rewarding shareholders in cash rather than issuing more shares. \u201cBen van Beurden has delivered an early Christmas present for Shell shareholders,\u201d said Nicholas Hyett, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, of the scrapping of the scrip dividend which was introduced after Shell bought gas behemoth BG Group for \u00a335bn in 2016. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s cheapest supermarket Christmas dinner will cost 18% more than it did last year, as the impact of inflation and Brexit-related commodity costs makes its way to the festive family table. The annual yuletide food survey by Good Housekeeping magazine found that the cost of the cheapest set-piece meal on Christmas Day \u2013 for 8 people and including 11 ingredients from turkey to fresh vegetables and cranberry sauce \u2013 had risen from \u00a319.82 to \u00a323.53, or from \u00a32.48 a head to \u00a32.94. The Good Housekeeping basket comprises of a whole turkey weighing at least 3.5kg, at least 880g each of potatoes, sprouts, carrots and parsnips; stuffing mix; a jar of cranberry sauce; at least 900g of Christmas pudding, Christmas cake, at least eight mince pies and a jar of brandy butter. Nine of the 11 cheapest items cost more than last year, including turkey, which is now \u00a38.99 from last year\u2019s \u00a38, and sage and onion stuffing mix, which has increased from 30p to 34p. Good Housekeeping said the increased cost was due to the pound\u2019s fall since last year\u2019s referendum, which has pushed up the cost of food imports, and an inflation rate that has hit 3%. \u201cThere\u2019s been a significant rise in food prices across the board over the last year as a result of the weakening of the pound following the Brexit vote. Add to this inflation being stuck at a five-year high, and it\u2019s no surprise to see the Christmas grocery bill has increased too,\u201d said Caroline Bloor, Good Housekeeping\u2019s consumer director. Overall, Lidl and Aldi have again trounced the competition, emerging as the cheapest supermarkets when it comes to the entire list on one place, with dinner for eight coming in at \u00a325.53 and \u00a325.68 respectively. Food prices generally had been tumbling in recent years as all the big supermarkets have had to react to the rise of the German discounters with aggressive price cutting. But the baskets from nine of the 10 supermarkets are more expensive than last year, with Aldi, Morrisons and Iceland all increasing their prices by more than 13%. Marks &amp; Spencer is the only supermarket whose basket is cheaper, 20% less at \u00a338.43, but still the second priciest. The most expensive overall was Waitrose\u2019s at \u00a341.47. Kay Neufeld, an economist at economics consultancy the Cebr, said:\u201cPrices have been on the rise since the EU referendum last year with inflation projected to peak just before Christmas. Due to intense competition between supermarkets in the UK, the cost of food had been falling for much of 2015 and 2016. However, as the UK imports over half of its food the depreciation of sterling inevitably feeds through into higher prices at the till. UK households will be relieved to know that inflationary pressures are expected to subside over 2018.\u201d New data published this month by the Office for National Statistics showed food prices in October were up by 4.2% on 12 months earlier, a sharp rise on the 0.6% increase the previous year. The October increase was the highest since 2013 and prompted the British Retail Consortium to warn that consumers face the prospect of an expensive Christmas dinner this year. Among the sharpest price increases was an 8.5% rise in the price of fish, with vegetables up 5.7%, fats and oils up 5.6%, and milk, cheese and eggs up 4.8%.
