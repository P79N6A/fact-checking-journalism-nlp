    "webTitle": "The great German government bond sell-off mystery", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a head-scratcher. Why have investors suddenly decided to dump German government bonds? The sell-off, seemingly on no news, has been extraordinary, affecting the entire European bond market. Yields, which move inversely to the price of the bond, briefly hit 0.8% on 10-year German debt on Thursday. Then they fell to 0.57%, but even that represents a surge from 0.1% only a few weeks ago. A glib explanation is to say that the ultra-low yields were wrong in the first place. Deflation is a worry, not a probability, so isn\u2019t lending to any government for a decade for a near-zero return a surefire way to destroy your capital? But that doesn\u2019t explain the suddenness of the move: the market in German government debt is meant to be deep, liquid and populated by grown-ups. Greece doesn\u2019t offer a plausible answer. Grexit \u2013 if anything \u2013 seems more likely than it did a month ago, in which case you\u2019d expect a rush into German debt. \u201cSupply indigestion,\u201d ran another idea \u2013 in other words, lots of European governments issuing bonds, trying to take advantage of the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying programme. Possibly. But what will happen when bond yields start to rise for reasons that are easier to explain \u2013 for example, a return of modest inflation and higher interest rates. On the evidence of Thursday\u2019s brief wobble in stock markets, it won\u2019t be pretty for share prices. Ladbrokes is losing its bet One of Peter Erskine\u2019s first acts as chairman of Ladbrokes six years ago was to cut the dividend and launch a rights issue. It wasn\u2019t his fault, of course, that the bookmaker, drunk on delusions of resilience, had been trying to run with absurd levels of debt. But the cheery optimism that punctuated the annual report after the fundraising was definitely Erskine\u2019s work. \u201cWe look forward positively with a heightened sense of momentum,\u201d he wrote in 2010. He\u2019s been saying more or less the same every year, even as the longed-for momentum has usually been in the wrong direction. Erskine\u2019s tenure is now closing with the share price lower than it was in late 2009, which hardly seemed possible at the time. In the same period, William Hill\u2019s shares have roughly trebled in value. Or try this statistic: Ladbrokes, capitalised at roughly \u00a31bn, is worth only half as much as upstart Betfair. Gruff chairmen of the old-school say the job carries only two basic demands \u2013appoint the right chief executive and fire him if things don\u2019t work out. Erskine chose Richard Glynn to knock Ladbrokes\u2019 website into shape and stuck with him through umpteen profits warnings until last December. It was no surprise, then, that Thursday\u2019s annual meeting produced a hefty 30% rebellion over Glynn\u2019s princely payoff. Erskine says he\u2019s going because Ladbrokes needs a chairman \u201cwho will be able to see out the entirety of the next stage of the journey\u201d. What he didn\u2019t add is that the next staging-post for the dividend is likely to be lower. The City thinks it\u2019s odds-on that new chief executive Jim Mullen will rip up Erskine\u2019s semi-pledge to hold the line on the divi. So, a cut on the way in and a cut on the way out \u2013 remarkable. BT, too big to nail? BT, as its rivals have noticed, is a formidable beast these days. Thursday provided a further illustration: \u201cadjusted\u201d pretax profits rose 12% to \u00a33.2bn, free cashflow was \u00a32.8bn, and the dividend was hiked 14%. Meanwhile, the retail business had a \u201crecord-breaking\u201d 266,000 fibre broadband connections in the final quarter. Next year, if all goes to plan, BT will be reporting on its improvements at mobile operator EE, a \u00a312bn purchase awaiting a regulatory thumbs-up. A monopolistic behemoth in the making? That\u2019s the gist of the complaints from competitors, such as TalkTalk and Sky, who want BT broken up \u2013 meaning the full separation of Openreach, which runs the national broadband network. They are pinning their hopes on Ofcom\u2019s current 10-yearly review of the market. The break-up question certainly isn\u2019t simple. Would a liberated Openreach be more or less inclined to invest in hi-speed capacity? And would those investments result in lower prices and better service? Critics says there is an inherent conflict of interest in a critical piece of infrastructure, serving a range of competitors, being a subsidiary of BT. BT maintains that a sitting tenant is required to encourage the investment to happen in the first place at affordable prices. Besides, it argues, functional separation of Openreach has been a fact of life for a decade, giving Ofcom freedom to intervene. That technical debate can resume once we\u2019ve heard Ofcom\u2019s first thoughts. In the meantime, though, there are probably two reasons why BT\u2019s investors appear wholly unconcerned by the noise. First, the UK would be going out on a limb by ordering a break-up of BT; other big European companies haven\u2019t acted in similar fashion with their former incumbents. Second, nothing will happen soon. Even if Ofcom sees merit in releasing Openreach, the Competition and Markets Authority would have to be convinced, which could take two years, and then BT might appeal all the way to the supreme court.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a head-scratcher. Why have investors suddenly decided to dump German government bonds? The sell-off, seemingly on no news, has been extraordinary, affecting the entire European bond market. Yields, which move inversely to the price of the bond, briefly hit 0.8% on 10-year German debt on Thursday. Then they fell to 0.57%, but even that represents a surge from 0.1% only a few weeks ago.</p> <p>A glib explanation is to say that the ultra-low yields were wrong in the first place. Deflation is a worry, not a probability, so isn\u2019t lending to any government for a decade for a near-zero return a surefire way to destroy your capital? But that doesn\u2019t explain the suddenness of the move: the market in German government debt is meant to be deep, liquid and populated by grown-ups.</p> <p>Greece doesn\u2019t offer a plausible answer. Grexit \u2013 if anything \u2013 seems more likely than it did a month ago, in which case you\u2019d expect a rush into German debt. \u201cSupply indigestion,\u201d ran another idea \u2013 in other words, lots of European governments issuing bonds, trying to take advantage of the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying programme. Possibly.</p> <p>But what will happen when bond yields start to rise for reasons that are easier to explain \u2013 for example, a return of modest inflation and higher interest rates. On the evidence of Thursday\u2019s brief wobble in stock markets, it won\u2019t be pretty for share prices.</p> <h2>Ladbrokes is losing its bet</h2> <p>One of Peter Erskine\u2019s first acts as chairman of Ladbrokes six years ago was to cut the dividend and launch a rights issue. It wasn\u2019t his fault, of course, that the bookmaker, drunk on delusions of resilience, had been trying to run with absurd levels of debt. But the cheery optimism that punctuated the annual report after the fundraising was definitely Erskine\u2019s work. \u201cWe look forward positively with a heightened sense of momentum,\u201d he wrote in 2010.<br></p> <p>He\u2019s been saying more or less the same every year, even as the longed-for momentum has usually been in the wrong direction. Erskine\u2019s tenure is now closing with the share price lower than it was in late 2009, which hardly seemed possible at the time. In the same period, William Hill\u2019s shares have roughly trebled in value. Or try this statistic: Ladbrokes, capitalised at roughly \u00a31bn, is worth only half as much as upstart Betfair.</p> <p>Gruff chairmen of the old-school say the job carries only two basic demands \u2013appoint the right chief executive and fire him if things don\u2019t work out.</p> <p>Erskine chose Richard Glynn to knock Ladbrokes\u2019 website into shape and stuck with him through umpteen profits warnings until last December. It was no surprise, then, that Thursday\u2019s annual meeting produced a hefty 30% rebellion over Glynn\u2019s princely payoff.</p> <p>Erskine says he\u2019s going because Ladbrokes needs a chairman \u201cwho will be able to see out the entirety of the next stage of the journey\u201d. What he didn\u2019t add is that the next staging-post for the dividend is likely to be lower. The City thinks it\u2019s odds-on that new chief executive Jim Mullen will rip up Erskine\u2019s semi-pledge to hold the line on the divi.</p> <p>So, a cut on the way in and a cut on the way out \u2013 remarkable.</p> <h2>BT, too big to nail?</h2> <p>BT, as its rivals have noticed, is a formidable beast these days.

And he muses over whether those not paying much for their food deserve good service: \u201cWhen you\u2019re paying a dollar for a burger, is it the end of the world if I accidentally forgot to take the mustard off the order?\u201d But to Franco, the key thing is that McDonald\u2019s helped him follow his acting dream. \u201cAll the waiter jobs were taken by more experienced actor/waiters,\u201d but at McDonald\u2019s: \u201cWhen I was hungry for work, they fed the need.\u201d Franco\u2019s experience as an 18-year-old aspiring actor trying to survive on McDonald\u2019s pay is not the norm. For him, this was a temporary job, something to tide him over until his big break, which came in the form of a Superbowl commercial \u2013 for fast food rival Pizza Hut. \u201cFrom that point on, I could support myself through acting,\u201d he notes.",

      "bodyText": "Weakness in the fixed income market, notably a plunge in German 10 year bond prices, as well as Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments that equity valuations were \u201cquite high\u201d sent European markets tumbling in early trading. But with oil prices slipping back after European stocks rose, there was a revival in both equities and bonds. A rise in US markets also helped sentiment. German bond yields are currently slightly down on the day at 0.58%, while most markets ended in positive territory. An exception was the UK, which was also affected by election jitters as voters went to the polls in what appears to be the closest contest for decades. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 lost 46.79 points or 0.67% to 6886.95 having fallen as low as 6810 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.51% to 11,407.97 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.29% at 4967.22 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.8% to 22,841.92 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.15% at 11,180.3 The Athens market added 3.01% to 841.54 on hopes of a deal to avoid Greek default as talks with creditors were set to continue on Friday and over the weekend On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 113 points or 0.63% after better then expected weekly jobless claims. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Greece\u2019s deputy prime minister has endorsed growing expressions of optimism in talks with the country\u2019s creditors, saying enough \u201ccommon ground\u201d has been found to enable both sides to reach an agreement. Helena Smith writes: Giannis Dragasakis said he hoped Monday\u2019s meeting of eurogroup finance ministers would finally break ground by signalling that progress had been made. \u201cI hope on Monday a sign of progress will be given and [they say] an agreement is visible,\u201d the 68-year-old politician told the Guardian. \u201cTalks, so far, have shown that there is common ground in changes and political measures and, therefore, I believe a deal is possible and in the interests of everyone.\u201d But Dragasakis, a former communist who has oversight of the leftist-led government\u2019s economic policy, cautioned that the debt-stricken country\u2019s desperate liquidity problem would also have to be eased. The European Central Bank\u2019s decision on Wednesday to loosen the noose by increasing emergency financial assistance to the nation\u2019s banking system was unlikely to provide the breathing space needed for Athens to stay solvent and keep apace with debt repayments and public sector salaries and pensions. \u201cCooperation is required from all sides so that the cash flow problem is confronted,\u201d he said. Thursday was one of the busiest days for European stock markets in the last two years, according to data from BATS Global Markets. Almost \u20ac72bn of shares changed hands, they reported, twice the average for a typical day in May last year. The average in April was just over \u00a356bn. French economist Thomas Piketty said a Grexit would be a catastrophe which would be the beginning of the end for the euro. The author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century said in a report in Forbes: It would be a catastrophe for the eurozone if Greece were pushed out. It would be the beginning of the end of the single currency. People every morning would be asking \u2018who will be the next to leave?\u2019 That would be the beginning of the end. And the governments of France and Germany have not prepared public opinion for such an eventuality; they would have to do that very quickly. Full report here. Markets have been volatile during the day, to say the least, with Germany\u2019s Dax in positive territory after a recovery in German bonds and most other European markets edging higher. But the UK is still in the red amid general election jitters. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets UK said: European stock markets were left a little out of breath on Thursday as government bond markets pulled a full 180 degree turn from savage losses to a sizeable move higher. A fall in crude oil prices tempered the inflation fears that have caused a massive jump in bond yields this week. The German bund was headed for its biggest two week drop since its inception as yields spiked across the UK, Europe and Asia but US jobless claims holding at 15 year lows took some of the sting out of oil prices as the dollar rallied. The resulting fall in the euro helped European equities edge back towards positive territory led by the export-orientated German DAX index. UK Election Day uncertainty has created hesitancy in markets rather than outright fear of the unknown. There\u2019s hardly been a tidal wave of selling but seemingly an unwillingness to jump in with two feet to any stocks until the election result is known. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 81 points after better than expected weekly jobless claims, ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. On the situation in the bond markets, Hargreaves Lansdown senior analyst Laith Khalaf said: The recent fall in gilt prices is a warning shot to bond investors. Even though yields are still exceptionally low, they aren\u2019t as low as they were, and that has taken its toll on capital invested at the wrong time. The sell-off is a reminder of the risk of investing in bonds at such low yields. This is heightened by the fact government bonds are seen as safe investments, and consequently feature in many pension funds and supposedly low-risk portfolios. The European Council has just published the agenda for Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting - you remember, the one where everyone is now saying there will be no breakthrough. The meeting will discuss Ireland as well as holding a thematic discussion on ensuring strong fiscal frameworks in the euro area member states. And, oh yes, Greece: Ministers will continue the discussion on the situation in Greece. They will be briefed on the state of play in the ongoing discussions between the Greek authorities and the three institutions - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the list of reforms that the Greek government is expected to complete under the current agreement. The reform list is a necessary step to complete the ongoing review and thus unlock the payment of the remaining tranche of financial assistance. And now German 10 year bond yields are unchanged on the day after their earlier surge, back down to 0.60%. Here\u2019s an interview with Danae Stratou\u2019s rival for the lead role in Common People: More from Sch\u00e4uble, courtesy of Reuters: 07-May-2015 14:35:30 - GERMAN FINMIN SCHAEUBLE SAYS ON GREECE MY EXPECATIONS FOR EUROGROUP ON MONDAY ARE NOT HIGH 07-May-2015 14:37:31 - GERMAN FINMIN SCHAEUBLE SAYS WILL MEET WITH MY GREEK COLLEAGUE BEFORE THE EUROGROUP MEETING 07-May-2015 14:41:06 - GERMAN FINMIN SCHAEUBLE SAYS IF GREECE GETS HELP FROM RUSSIA THAT\u2019S WONDERFUL BUT IT WILL NOT BE AS MUCH AS GREECE NEEEDS Germany\u2019s finance minister has doused any remaining optimism of a Greek breakthrough next Monday. Encouragingly, though, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble did indicate that relations between the two sides is a little better.... Journalists of a certain age (ahem) have been humming away and tapping their shoes all morning, thanks to a fantastic rumour that Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s wife may be the star of the 1995 Britpop classic, Common People. That\u2019s according to the Athens Voice. It probably falls into the \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d category. But still...... Over to the Independent: One of pop culture\u2019s enduring mysteries may have just been solved. Greek paper the Athens Voice has revealed that the wife of Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek Finance minister, could be the rich art student Jarvis Cocker wrote about in Pulp\u2019s single \u2018Common People\u2019. Danae Stratou studied at St. Martins College of Art and Design between 1983 and 1988, the same year Cocker enrolled in a film studies course there during a break from the band. He told NME in 2013 that he met the Greek girl in the song during \u2018Crossover Fortnight\u2019, when St Martins students switched into another discipline for two weeks. In a later interview Cocker remembered a conversation with the Greek woman who \u201cwanted to move to Hackney and live like \u2018the common people\u2019\u201d. He used this as the basis for the song. But the identity of the woman has never been discovered, despite a search launched by BBC3. Stratou\u2019s CV confirms she was at St Martins at the right time.....but those in the know reckon it\u2019s probably an urban myth. Hey ho. The Greek stock market is continuing to rally. It\u2019s now up over 4%, on optimism that an agreement can be reached before Greece hits the wall. That\u2019s despite Greek government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis insisting that Athens won\u2019t roll over. He told reporters that: \u201cThere should not be an expectation on the part of institutions ... that the government will back down on everything....When you negotiate, there should be mutual concessions. Pension cuts remain off limits, he added: \u201cWe won\u2019t go beyond the limits of our red lines. It\u2019s clear that we cannot cut pensions.\u201d Back in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been meeting with government cleaning ladies who have been rehired after a long battle. These cleaners were laid off as part of the previous administration\u2019s austerity measures, but refused to go quietly. Instead, they picketed outside the finance ministry, protesting against the bailout programme -- and famously forcing Troika officials to flee down a fire escape. Tsipras had vowed to rehire them. And on Tuesday night, the Greek parliament passed legislation to overturn layoffs, and open the way to rehiring thousands of public sector staff. It\u2019s been a wild old day in the European equity markets. Germany\u2019s DAX has now bounced into positive territory, tracking the stomach-churning swings in the price of its government bonds. But general election worries are still pushing down shares in London, where the FTSE 100 is down almost 1%: Thanks to the Wall Street Journal, we have details of Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s comments in Brussels this lunchtime. And the top line is that Greece\u2019s finance chief has not given up hope of a deal. Greece\u2019s Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis sees an agreement between Greece and its international creditors, which would unlock desperately needed aid for the debt-stricken state, being reached within the next few days, or weeks. \u201cI trust an agreement will be in the offing in the next few days, or weeks,\u201d Varoufakis said Thursday, speaking at a business conference in Brussels. His comments come as Greece\u2019s leftist-led government is locked in negotiations with its international creditors \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission \u2014 over its next slice of financial aid as part of a \u20ac245 billion rescue package. The country\u2019s next big hurdle is a \u20ac750 million loan repayment to the IMF due May 12, having made a smaller payment this week. As Helena Smith reported from Athens earlier, there is renewed confidence in Greece of a breakthrough in time. Varoufakis is still taking questions in Brussels. He insists that Greece both wants to repay the IMF, and will do so. But he is adamant that the country\u2019s previous aid programmes have been a failure -- particularly the first bailout agreed five years ago this month: As flagged up earlier, he also argued that Greece needs a bad bank to deal with non-performing loans and unclog the banking system. And a legal \u201cdebt brake\u201d could be imposed, to prevent future excessive borrowing, he added. Varoufakis was also scathing about Greece\u2019s creditors, saying that the sight of motorcades of Troika officials zooming around Athens was a \u201chumiliation\u201d. Dramatic swings are taking place in the bond market. After crashing this morning, German bunds are now rebounding -- pushing the yield on 10-year bunds back down to around 0.63%. Greece\u2019s finance minister has also slapped down the suggestion that Greece has been rescued by countries who are even poorer. The money didn\u2019t go to us, he says, but to eurozone banks who held Greek debt. Yanis Varoufakis is also denying that he\u2019s been sidelined from the bailout talks. We\u2019re all pulling together in perfect harmony, the Greek finance minister tells reporters: More from Brussels... Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, is giving a speech in Brussels now. It sounds like his now-traditional lecture on the failings of the past, along with an outline of a better future (if only creditors would agree...). But he also claims that a deal could be close... GREEK FINANCE MINISTER VAROUFAKIS SAYS EXPECTS A DEAL ON FUDNING WITH CREDITORS WITHIN DAYS OR WEEKS VAROUFAKIS SAYS BAILOUT REFORM PROGRAMME HAS BEEN A FAILURE VAROUFAKIS SAYS WE NEED A BAD BANK TO UNCLOG BANKING SYSTEM AND A DEVELOPMENT BANK LINKED TO PRIVATISATION OF STATE ASSETS VAROUFAKIS SAYS GREECE IS READY TO INTRODUCE DEBT BREAK TO PREVENT FUTURE EXCESSIVE BORROWING Greece and its creditors will continue to negotiate today, tomorrow, and over the weekend in the hope of making progress before Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. The Athen stock market is bucking the trend today, and has risen by 2.5%. And that\u2019s because Greece remains hopeful of a bailout deal before it runs out of cash. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: For the first time in a very long time the Greek media has been hit by that rarest of bugs: optimism. Encouraged by the \u201cprogress in talks\u201d \u2013 voiced by the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker last night - television pundits &amp; newspaper headlines are suddenly talking of \u201ca ray of hope\u201d that might \u2013 just might - lead to a breakthrough after Monday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting (of euro finance ministers). Typical of the new mood is the headline in today\u2019s Ethnos: \u201cFirst Time Optimism\u201d it screamed from its front page. \u201cMessage of convergence with a common statement from Tsipras/Juncker. Athens is hoping for a statement of progress from the Euro Group. After the ECB\u2019s decision to raise emergency financial assistance to Greek banks (by \u20ac2bn), the sense is that things are beginning to look up. \u201cTwo days of optimism in a row. Now that is something very new!\u201d one pundit told Skai news this morning. Here\u2019s our full story on the selloff that has hit the markets as Britain holds its tightest election in decades. And here\u2019s a flavour: London shares suffered a sharp sell-off on Thursday morning as voting got under way in the closest general election for decades. Fears that Britain is set for a second successive hung parliament added to a global markets sell-off after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen warned share valuations could be dangerously high. The leading FTSE 100 index tumbled by 121 points, or 1.7%, to 6813, as voters headed for the polls in what is expected to be one of the closest elections in years, with the major parties neck and neck in opinion polls. According to preliminary results of the final Guardian/ICM campaign poll, Labour and the Conservatives were tied at 35% each. A YouGov poll in Scotland for the Times shows Sturgeon\u2019s party \u2013 with which Miliband has ruled out any formal deal \u2013 enjoying 48% of support to Labour\u2019s 28%, putting several key figures, including the Scottish Labour leader, Jim Murphy, in peril of losing their seats. Andy McLevey at Interactive Investor said: \u201cAs UK voters go to the polls, uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the UK election is also preying on sentiment as cautious investors remain on the sidelines.\u201d Dafydd Davies at Charles Hanover Investments told Reuters: \u201cGiven the [market] rally we\u2019ve had so far this year, you could not say the mood is too alarmist over the election outcome. Worried that the selloff has hit your pension or ISA? Here\u2019s the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 today: Ninety five of the 100 companies who make up the FTSE 100 has fallen this morning: Today\u2019s bond selloff is being fuelled by the fact the market has become quite illiquid. Investors have been piling into government bonds for many months, driving prices to record highs. Which is fine, until everyone decides the party is over and tries to leave.... French government debt is also sliding, sending the yield (interest rate) on its 10-year bonds up over 1%. The selloff in German government debt is turning into a full-blown rout today, sending fear rippling through the financial markets. As prices fall, the yield on 10-year Bunds has jumped to 0.75%, from 0.6% last night. That\u2019s the highest level since mid-December 2014. It\u2019s quite a turnaround since mid-April when German 10-year yields fell to just 0.07%, meaning investors were accepting virtually no return on their investment. This sort of turnaround hasn\u2019t been seen in decades: And the ripples are hitting shares too -- the FTSE 100 index has now shed 116 points, as bond fears and General Election angst prove a nasty cocktail. Here\u2019s another chart showing that the cost of buying protection against sterling volatility is its highest in several years: The UK election is hitting demand for the pound and British government debt [gilts], says David Madden, market analyst at IG. Sterling will be subdued as voters go to the polls today, and with no clear outcome in the pipeline for today\u2019s election dealers will be avoiding the pound like the plague. Gilts have a gloomy outlook for today\u2019s session too. The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year gilts has risen from 1.99% to 2.08% this morning, meaning Britain would pay more to borrow in the markets. Madden also blames the Greek crisis for the sea of red engulfing European markets: Greece has repaid \u20ac200 million to the IMF, but the deal for Monday still hangs in the balance. The ECB has increased the emerging financing facility for Greek banks, and the market is viewing this as a sign of weakness. Even though the Greek banking system has no shortage of funds, the Athens administration is in a very different situation. Even if Greece somehow manages to broker a deal by Monday, the indebted nation will have to make considerably larger repayments in the coming months and if the Greek government is having difficulty meeting Monday\u2019s deadline what are the chances it will survive the summer deadlines? City traders are also bracing for sharp swings in the value of sterling when the election results come in. The overnight cost of protecting against big swings in sterling\u2019s exchange rate has jumped to its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. It\u2019s above the previous recent high in September 2014, when the Scottish independence referendum was held. This shows investors are seeking protection against the possibility of the pound either jumping or slumping overnight. Nick Lawson, a managing director at Deutsche Bank in London, explains why the markets are cautious: \u201cThe problem is that this the closest election we have seen for a very long time, and in many ways the process doesn\u2019t really start until we know the result and whether we have a \u2018working\u2019 government.\u201d (via Reuters) The pound is coming under some pressure this morning amid general election uncertainty. Sterling has dropped by almost half a percent, to $1.518 against the US dollar and \u20ac1.3436 against the euro. That\u2019s not a reason to panic; it\u2019s not a major move, and it also follows a rise in sterling yesterday. But it does indicate that there is nervousness about the election. This tweet shows how the pound has lost ground against almost all major currencies this morning: Over in Greece, Syriza MP Costas Lapavitsas has warned that Greece could struggle to meet its financing demands without a deal soon. Lapavitsas, an economics professor, also blamed the country\u2019s creditors for taking a hard stance. Greece crisis watcher Diane Shugart has the details: Lapavitsas also blames Greece\u2019s creditors for the deadlock: World markets have been dipping since peaking in late-April: The sharp sell-off in government bonds in recent days shows that investors have grown weary of paying such elevated prices for sovereign debt. As the Financial Times explains: Steven Major, global head of fixed income research at HSBC, said the bond sell-off was driven by investor fatigue, as well as burgeoning signs of inflation and higher issuance of eurozone bonds. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of indigestion,\u201d he said. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t the same appetite for bonds at ultra-low yields.\u201d Before investors became sated, they had driven the yields on many short-term eurozone bonds into negative territory, meaning they were paying for the privilege of lending to governments. The FTSE 100 index is also being dragged down by supermarket chain Morrisons; its shares are down 6.6% after reporting that sales have continued to decline. Like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, slipped by another 2.9% in the last three months as the firm continues to struggle. The general election is also weighing on the London stock market, as Brits head to the polls for the tightest race in decades. The FTSE 100 index fell over 50 points, or 0.7%, in early trading. The prospect of a hung parliament, weeks of uncertainty, or an unstable minority government are all reasons to be cautious today: As Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets points out: The softer open comes in the run up to the closest run UK election since World War 2. But as Ian Williams of Peel Hunt points out, Britain\u2019s ballot boxes isn\u2019t the only factor hitting shares: As the UK goes to the polls, investors have plenty of other issues to focus on away from domestic politics. Yesterday saw core sovereign bond yields continue to head higher; Brent oil prices hit a new peak for the year, as US crude stocks fell for the first time since January; and Fed Chair Yellen suggested that the current level of equity market valuations is \u201cquite high\u201d and poses \u201cpotential dangers\u201d. Eurozone bonds are still fairly close to their record high levels (reminder, prices fall when yields rise), but the scale of the sell-off is quite startling. Anyone who piled into German bunds this year is now facing a loss. European stock markets have hit their lowest levels in two months, as the bond rout hits confidence. The German, French, UK, Spanish and Italian markets are all in the red, following losses in Asia over night. Here\u2019s the early damage. This comes after the world\u2019s most powerful central banker, Janet Yellen, warned that share valuations are \u201cgenerally quite high\u201d. As we wrote last night: \u201cThere are potential dangers there,\u201d she said, in remarks reminiscent of her predecessor Alan Greenspan\u2019s infamous 1996 warning that some investors were showing, \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d. The slide in eurozone government bonds is continuing this morning, driving up borrowing costs to the highest levels of the year. The yields, or interest rates, on German, French, Italian and Spanish sovereign debt has all risen again, as traders continue to push prices down from recent record highs. Government bonds have been weakening for days, with several factors being blamed. One is the recent rise in the oil price; if that pushes eurozone inflation higher, it could encourage the European Central Bank to slow its bond-buying quantitative easing scheme. That theory has also helped to push the euro higher: Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen threw more fuel on the fire yesterday, warning that bond yields could jump sharply once the Fed raises interest rates. Yellen\u2019s comments could hit sentiment hard, as Stan Shamu of IG Index explains: Bond market weakness has been a key theme across the US and European markets. This has now clearly started having an impact on equities with confidence being sapped out of the market. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... the Greek bailout deadlock continues to dominate the eurozone, with speculation swirling that a referendum may be called. Last night the European Central Bank agreed to give Greece\u2019s banking sector another \u20ac2bn of emergency liquidity, but that\u2019s only a temporary fix to its banks\u2019 problems. The next Red Letter Day is May 11, when eurozone finance ministers meet. Yesterday, though, a string of ministers appeared to rule out a quick deal -- even though Greece must find around \u20ac800m to repay the IMF on May 12. Unless the creditors cave in, Greece will surely have to compromise on issues such as labour market reforms to get a deal; despite the pre-election promises made by PM Alexis Tsipras. MPs from the governing Syriza party is due to meet tomorrow to discuss the situation, as the Kathimerini newspaper explains: The meeting will take place amid increasing calls from SYRIZA MPs and members for any deal to be put to a referendum. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras may take part in Friday\u2019s gathering, giving him a chance to get a taste of the mood within his party. It is not yet clear if a central committee meeting will be held over the weekend or if Tsipras will wait for further progress to be made in the talks before the party body convenes. It could be a quiet, nervy day in the City too as investors brace for the results of today\u2019s general election; the tightest in decades. Here\u2019s our General Election liveblog:",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons\u2019 new chief executive, David Potts, is canvassing shoppers and staff on how to build a stronger identity for the \u201cBritish underdog\u201d supermarket, as a continued decline in sales underlined the scale of the challenge at Britain\u2019s fourth biggest grocer. The former Tesco executive who replaced Dalton Philips as boss in February is sending a team of managers and graduate trainees into two stores each week to speak to customers and staff as he tries to identify \u201cunique characteristics [that] can become competitive strengths\u201d. \u201cI honestly believe if we listen hard to customers and our colleagues we won\u2019t go far wrong,\u201d Potts said. \u201cThey already hold the keys to the kingdom - why people love Morrisons. We need to work to bring that to life in more stores on more days.\u201d The Bradford-based grocer said sales at established stores, excluding fuel, fell 2.9% in the 13 weeks to 3 May. The pace of decline was worse than the 2.6% decline in the previous quarter although better than forecasts. The company said trading had improved in recent weeks after Potts introduced new measures to ensure shelves were well stocked, stores kept clean and 5,000 more staff were on shop floors. \u201cIf we can get those things to run the right way over the whole week then we should be rewarded,\u201d said Potts, who has personally toured 90 stores in his first seven weeks in the job. He said Morrisons, which runs about 500 stores and serves 11m customers a week, was a \u201cgood brand\u201d adding: \u201cAs the British underdog we should rejoice in that position and bring it to life at the shop.\u201d Potts was hired by Morrisons\u2019 new chairman, Andy Higginson, to revive the chain after profits halved in the face of heavy competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl in its northern heartland. Like all the major grocers, it is also under pressure from falling commodity prices and shoppers who are reluctant to splash out on groceries. Morrisons said underlying profits before tax would be higher in the second half of the year. Its finance director, Trevor Strain, added that the company was happy with City forecasts of \u00a3356m for full-year profits. Profits more than halved to \u00a3345m last year, the group\u2019s worst result in eight years. Including a \u00a31.3bn writedown of the value of its supermarkets, it reported a statutory loss of \u00a3792m. Investors were not impressed and the shares were the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest faller, losing 6.5%. They have sunk from 296p two years ago to just under 177p. In an attempt to cut costs, Potts has moved swiftly to oust a string of senior directors and axed 720 head office jobs. The company said on Thursday the head office reorganisation would result in a one-off charge of up to \u00a340m. Morrisons also closed more stores than it opened during the first quarter, which led to a net reduction in selling space of more than 50,000 sq ft. Details of Potts\u2019 plan to rebuild Morrisons are expected to be revealed in the autumn after he has considered feedback from the stores\u2019 focus groups, a company-wide staff questionnaire and hundreds of thousands of emails from shoppers. Potts said it was already clear that shoppers wanted \u201cprices they can trust\u201d as well as special offers - indicating more price cuts may be on the way. Earlier this week Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, predicted that food deflation would continue for the next 12-18 months. Strain said: \u201cThe supermarket sector has widely acknowledged that it needs to be more competitive \u2026 The consequence of this is more food deflation.\u201d But he stressed the importance to Morrisons of fresh food and the retailer\u2019s unique supply chain, through which it processes much of its own meat, fish and fresh vegetables. Potts said the retailer had the chance to increase market share in a range of products where it was underperforming, including health &amp; beauty, gluten-free foods and white wine. \u201cI don\u2019t see a minute of any day when I am not seeing a better opportunity for this company and we have only just started to listen to customers,\u201d Potts said. Shore Capital analyst Darren Shirley said: \u201cIt is clearly still very early days in Mr Potts\u2019s tenure but we sense he is bringing a deep-rooted and fundamental change to Morrisons that is for the better. We make this assertion not because Dalton Philips was ineffectual but because in this market the business needs an experienced leader. In this respect we demonstrably believe that Mr Potts has hit the ground running.\u201d Speaking to shoppers It will take Morrisons the next few years to conduct focus groups for staff and shoppers in each of its 500 stores as it tries to stem falling sales and profits. The retailer\u2019s customer research team will work with graduate management trainees to ask small groups of regular shoppers, local people who shop elsewhere, and store staff how they think their local store could improve. Once the findings have been assessed, Morrisons will send in a team to respond to particular issues in each store, whether that\u2019s putting the baked beans in a place that\u2019s easier find or revamping the toilets. Early feedback will also inform a major effort by new chief executive David Potts make Morrisons more attractive to shoppers. The former Tesco executive has already sent out a questionnaire to all Morrisons\u2019 120,000 staff and used social media to speak directly to shoppers. Hundreds of thousands of shoppers and staff have emailed in since Potts issued a video plea for comments on his first day in the job.",

      "body": "<p>Morrisons\u2019 new chief executive, David Potts, is canvassing shoppers and staff on how to build a stronger identity for the \u201cBritish underdog\u201d supermarket, as a continued decline in sales underlined the scale of the challenge at Britain\u2019s fourth biggest grocer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/25/morrisons-tesco-man-david-potts-chief-executive\">The former Tesco executive</a> who replaced Dalton Philips as boss in February is sending a team of managers and graduate trainees into two stores each week to speak to customers and staff as he tries to identify \u201cunique characteristics [that] can become competitive strengths\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI honestly believe if we listen hard to customers and our colleagues we won\u2019t go far wrong,\u201d Potts said. \u201cThey already hold the keys to the kingdom - why people love Morrisons. We need to work to bring that to life in more stores on more days.\u201d</p> <p>The Bradford-based grocer said sales at established stores, excluding fuel, fell 2.9% in the 13 weeks to 3 May. The pace of decline was worse than the 2.6% decline in the previous quarter although better than forecasts. The company said trading had improved in recent weeks after Potts introduced new measures to ensure shelves were well stocked, stores kept clean and 5,000 more staff were on shop floors. </p> <p>\u201cIf we can get those things to run the right way over the whole week then we should be rewarded,\u201d said Potts, who has personally toured 90 stores in his first seven weeks in the job. </p> <p>He said Morrisons, which runs about 500 stores and serves 11m customers a week, was a \u201cgood brand\u201d adding: \u201cAs the British underdog we should rejoice in that position and bring it to life at the shop.\u201d</p> <p>Potts was hired by Morrisons\u2019 new chairman, Andy Higginson, to revive the chain after profits halved in the face of heavy competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl in its northern heartland. Like all the major grocers, it is also under pressure from falling commodity prices and shoppers who are reluctant to splash out on groceries.</p> <p>Morrisons said underlying profits before tax would be higher in the second half of the year. Its finance director, Trevor Strain, added that the company was happy with City forecasts of \u00a3356m for full-year profits. Profits more than halved to \u00a3345m last year, the group\u2019s worst result in eight years. Including a \u00a31.3bn writedown of the value of its supermarkets, it reported a statutory loss of \u00a3792m.</p> <p>Investors were not impressed and the shares were the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest faller, losing 6.5%. They have sunk from 296p two years ago to just under 177p.</p> <p>In an attempt to cut costs, Potts has moved swiftly to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/24/morrisons-sacks-half-its-senior-management-team\">oust a string of senior directors</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/16/morrisons-to-cut-700-head-office-jobs\">axed 720 head office jobs</a>. The company said on Thursday the head office reorganisation would result in a one-off charge of up to \u00a340m. Morrisons also closed more stores than it opened during the first quarter, which led to a net reduction in selling space of more than 50,000 sq ft.</p> <p>Details of Potts\u2019 plan to rebuild Morrisons are expected to be revealed in the autumn after he has considered feedback from the stores\u2019 focus groups, a company-wide staff questionnaire and hundreds of thousands of emails from shoppers.</p> <p>Potts said it was already clear that shoppers wanted \u201cprices they can trust\u201d as well as special offers - indicating more price cuts may be on the way.</p> <p>Earlier this week Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, predicted that food deflation would continue for the next 12-18 months.</p> <p>Strain said: \u201cThe supermarket sector has widely acknowledged that it needs to be more competitive \u2026 The consequence of this is more food deflation.\u201d </p> <p>But he stressed the importance to Morrisons of fresh food and the retailer\u2019s unique supply chain, through which it processes much of its own meat, fish and fresh vegetables.</p> <p>Potts said the retailer had the chance to increase market share in a range of products where it was underperforming, including health &amp; beauty, gluten-free foods and white wine.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see a minute of any day when I am not seeing a better opportunity for this company and we have only just started to listen to customers,\u201d Potts said.</p> <p>Shore Capital analyst Darren Shirley said: \u201cIt is clearly still very early days in Mr Potts\u2019s tenure but we sense he is bringing a deep-rooted and fundamental change to Morrisons that is for the better. We make this assertion not because Dalton Philips was ineffectual but because in this market the business needs an experienced leader. In this respect we demonstrably believe that Mr Potts has hit the ground running.\u201d</p> <h2>Speaking to shoppers</h2> <p>It will take Morrisons the next few years to conduct focus groups for staff and shoppers in each of its 500 stores as it tries to stem falling sales and profits.</p> <p>The retailer\u2019s customer research team will work with graduate management trainees to ask small groups of regular shoppers, local people who shop elsewhere, and store staff how they think their local store could improve.</p> <p>Once the findings have been assessed, Morrisons will send in a team to respond to particular issues in each store, whether that\u2019s putting the baked beans in a place that\u2019s easier find or revamping the toilets.</p> <p>Early feedback will also inform a major effort by new chief executive David Potts make Morrisons more attractive to shoppers. The former Tesco executive has already sent out a questionnaire to all Morrisons\u2019 120,000 staff and used social media to speak directly to shoppers. Hundreds of thousands of shoppers and staff have emailed in since Potts<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/16/morrisons-supermarket-new-chief-executive-promises-to-listen\"> issued a video plea for comments on his first day</a> in the job.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p>",

      "bodyText": "Alibaba shares soared 7% on Thursday after the Chinese internet trading company announced it was replacing its chief executive as part of a purge of older managers. The company, which has lost more than $20bn (\u00a313bn) of market value since its $231bn flotation on the New York stock exchange in September, said current CEO Jonathan Lu would be replaced by chief operating officer Daniel Zhang on Sunday. Investors welcomed the management shake-up, and a better-than-expected 45% increase in quarterly sales, sending Alibaba shares up nearly 8% to $86 by 11am. Despite the share price surge \u2013 the biggest intraday increase since September \u2013 the shares are still far below the $119.15 they hit in a post flotation high in November. Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s billionaire founder, said: \u201cDaniel is a proven international business leader and innovator with a strong track record of delivering results. \u201cHe has the confidence of our entire management team, and there is no better person to lead Alibaba Group as we embark on the next stage of our growth on top of the strong foundation that Jonathan helped build.\u201d Zhang, who joined Alibaba in 2007, became chief operating officer in September 2013 and was the key architect behind Singles Day \u2013 the 11 November event that has overtaken Black Friday in the US to become the world\u2019s largest online shopping event. Ma said the CEO change, which was part of a wider management shake-up, was part of a wider handover of control to a younger generation. \u201cThis marks a future where the post-70 generation will command the troops at Alibaba Group!,\u201d he said in a letter to employees. However, the age gap between Zhang and Lu is hardly massive. Zhang was born in 1972, while Lu born in 1969, according to Chinese media. The announcement came as the company reported a 45% jump in sales in the first three months of 2014 to 17.4bn yuan ($2.81bn) \u2013 beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $2.77bn. Zhang will be tasked with trying to extend Alibaba\u2019s reach into new markets. It has started sales in Russia, Brazil and India through its AliExpress service, but international sales accounted for just 9% of its revenue. Ma has set a target of getting 50% of sales from outside China. Analysts fear Alibaba may also be facing e-commerce user saturation. The increase of active buyers, or customers who buy at least one product a year, was the slowest in three-and-a-half years \u2013 up just 5% from the previous quarter to 350m. Mobile sales eclipsed desktop sales for the first time to account for 51% of total revenue, up from 42% in the previous quarter. Ma, an English teacher-turned businessman who twice failed his university entrance exams, founded Alibaba in a cramped one-bedroom flat in China 15 years ago. \u201cWe have a dream,\u201d Ma said as he rang the opening bell to officially launch the flotation on the NYSE last year. \u201cWe hope in the next 15 years the world changes because of us. We hope in 15 years people say this is a company like Microsoft, IBM, Walmart. They changed, shaped the world \u2026 We want to be bigger than Walmart.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "UK demand for new cars was unwavering in the face of political uncertainty last month as registrations hit a decade high. Sales rose 5.1% to 185,778 vehicles in what was the strongest April since 2005, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) . The jump is at odds with reports from some business surveys and companies which say customers are putting off purchases because of uncertainty over the general election. The SMMT said the rise in new car sales last month continued a pattern of growth around general elections that dates back to 1979. Six of the last nine general elections have coincided with a spike in new car sales in the three months immediately before and after polling day, according to the trade body. Exceptions were the elections of 1992 and 2010, which coincided with downturns, as well as 2005. \u201cThe figures highlight the current strength of consumer confidence, even at a time of such political uncertainty,\u201d said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive. He added: \u201cWe are confident that the UK\u2019s new car market \u2013 so symbolic of economic mood \u2013 will continue to thrive, but long-term success will depend largely on economic and political stability in the months and years ahead. \u201cWhatever the outcome of today\u2019s election, the next government must act quickly to uphold economic certainty and reassure consumers and markets.\u201d New car sales in 2015 so far are up 6.4% compared with the same point last year, at 920,366. Consumer appetite has been boosted in part by cheap finance deals making new cars more affordable. Britain\u2019s car industry has smashed records going back to 1959 with the longest-ever period of sales growth of new cars. April marked the 38th consecutive monthly increase. The top three bestsellers last month were the Ford Fiesta, the Ford Focus, and the Volkswagen Golf. The sales increase was driven largely by fleet sales \u2013 of more than 25 vehicles \u2013 which were up 9% in April. Private sales rose 2.7% while business sales were down 12.4%. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThe economic fundamentals still look largely healthy for the motor industry which will hopefully allow car sales to be sustained at a robust level over the coming months. \u201cThe autos sector will be hoping that there is not prolonged political uncertainty following the general election that fosters increased business and consumer caution and weighs down on economic activity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "London shares suffered a sharp sell-off on Thursday morning as voting got under way in the closest general election for decades. Fears that Britain is set for a second successive hung parliament added to a global markets sell-off after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen warned share valuations could be dangerously high. The leading FTSE 100 index tumbled by 121 points, or 1.7%, to 6813, as voters headed for the polls in what is expected to be one of the closest elections in years, with the major parties neck and neck in opinion polls. According to preliminary results of the final Guardian/ICM campaign poll, Labour and the Conservatives were tied at 35% each. A YouGov poll in Scotland for the Times shows Sturgeon\u2019s party \u2013 with which Miliband has ruled out any formal deal \u2013 enjoying 48% of support to Labour\u2019s 28%, putting several key figures, including the Scottish Labour leader, Jim Murphy, in peril of losing their seats. Andy McLevey at Interactive Investor said: \u201cAs UK voters go to the polls, uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the UK election is also preying on sentiment as cautious investors remain on the sidelines.\u201d Dafydd Davies at Charles Hanover Investments told Reuters: \u201cGiven the [market] rally we\u2019ve had so far this year, you could not say the mood is too alarmist over the election outcome. \u201cHowever the risk of a hung parliament is causing people to sell out a bit to cash in on the rally.\u201d As well as the UK election and Yellen\u2019s comments, investors are also nervous about the situation in Greece, as another deadline approaches without any deal with its creditors.

On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open down more than 100 points after an 86 point decline on Wednesday. Election jitters drove up the cost of buying protection against overnight sterling volatility on Thursday. The overnight cost of insuring against big swings in sterling\u2019s exchange rate broke above the level before the Scottish independence referendum last September. Buying protection against sterling volatility hasn\u2019t been this expensive since the 2008 financial crisis: The pound also lost around half a cent against the euro, to \u20ac1.338. \u201cSterling will be subdued as voters go to the polls today, and with no clear outcome in the pipeline for today\u2019s election dealers will be avoiding the pound like the plague, explained David Madden, market analyst at IG. Alex Gurr of currency foreign exchange site FXTM, says traders fear a hung parliament: \u201cThe UK election is leaving the pound in a lurch verses other currencies as uncertainty continues to reign in the market over one of the closest elections in history.\u201d Ed Miliband, Nigel Farage and Nicola Sturgeon all cast their votes within the first hour of polls opening, while the prime minister, David Cameron, made a last-minute YouTube appeal for support. Cameron\u2019s 48-second message continued the Conservatives\u2019 campaign theme of raising the spectre of Miliband as prime minister propped up by the Scottish National party. \u201cIf you want to stop Ed Miliband and the SNP from getting into power and wrecking our economy ... and if you want me back on work on Friday working through our long-term economic plan as your prime minister then it is vital that you vote Conservative,\u201d Cameron said. Cameron\u2019s message was echoed by the Daily Telegraph which emailed its readers pleading with them to back the Conservatives. Miliband cast his vote in Sutton village hall, close to his constituency home in Doncaster North. In Ballieston, Glasgow East, where Sturgeon cast her vote with her husband and SNP chief executive, Peter Murrell. The Scottish Labour party made a last-ditch attempt to stop the SNP surge that threatens to wipe out the party\u2019s strongholds in Scotland by putting out its own YouTube appeal for votes. It featured more from Labour\u2019s previous leader Gordon Brown than his successor. \u201cOnly a Labour government can prevent five more years of bedroom tax poverty,\u201d it quoted the former prime minister saying. Nick Clegg, who faces a fight to hold on to his own Sheffield Hallam seat, urged voters to stick with the Lib Dems as the only party able to provide a \u201cstable\u201d influence in a Tory or Labour administration. He said his party\u2019s performance will be the \u201csurprise story\u201d of polling day, dismissing predictions of an electoral mauling that has left key figures such as cabinet minister Danny Alexander vulnerable to a collapse in support after five years of governing in coalition with the Conservatives. In a final plea to people to vote Labour, Miliband will say: \u201cIf you do that today, then tomorrow you won\u2019t have to wake up to the news that five years of the Tories has turned into a Tory decade \u2013 a decade where only the privileged few will do well, where there will be one rule for a few and another for everyone else. So the stakes are high in these crucial hours.\u201d He said the Tories planned \u201cthe most extreme spending cuts of any political party for a generation\u201d that posed \u201ca clear and present danger to the family finances of working people\u201d. Polling stations will be open until 10pm on Thursday in what will be the busiest election day since 1979, with nearly 10,000 council seats also up for grabs.",

      "bodyText": "BT boss Gavin Patterson has warned that an EU referendum promised by the Conservatives would be \u201cbad for business\u201d, and urged the next government to adopt Labour\u2019s idea of a national infrastructure commission to manage big investments in areas such as energy, transport and telecoms. \u201cAn EU referendum will not be good for the company, we do a lot of business across Europe,\u201d said Patterson. BT and its global services division has significant contracts in Italy, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. David Cameron has promised a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU but Patterson said uncertainty over the issue could prompt companies to move investment out of the country. \u201cThe EU for all its idiosyncrasies is a positive thing for business. A referendum would be bad for business and bad for BT.\u201d Announcing full year revenues down 2% to \u00a317.9bn, BT said its retail division had captured the lion\u2019s share of new fibre internet customers on its network, signing up 266,000 homes to the superfast service. This was more than half the 455,000 new fibre connections to the network that BT shares with rival internet service providers including Sky and TalkTalk. Paying television customers were up by 52,000 in the quarter, taking the total to 1.14 million. The consumer mobile service, which launched six weeks ago offering 4G airtime without handsets, has signed more than \u00a350,000 customers. Patterson said BT was politically \u201cneutral\u201d, but he urged all parties to adopt plans put forward by Labour last year to put big decisions about national infrastructure into a politically independent body. Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls has promised to include legislation for an infrastructure commission in the first Queen\u2019s Speech after the election, following the model set out by former Railtrack chief executive John Armitt last year. Patterson, who spoke at a conference about Armitt\u2019s report in favour of the plan, said on Thursday: \u201cIt\u2019s a very good way of looking at big infrastructure investments across the country and taking them out of the political cycle. Whether it\u2019s a Labour or a Conservative government that is one idea I hope is taken forward.\u201d BT is predicting a return to revenue growth next year \u2013 excluding price cuts to transit revenues as imposed by regulators. But new investments in faster broadband could be put at risk if regulators decide to heed calls from BT\u2019s rivals to force it to spin off its network into a separate company. \u201cAs you can imagine we will fight that all the way,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for customers, bad for shareholders and bad for the country as a whole. It will be difficult to convince the board of BT to invest in ultrafast if we have that uncertainty over separation.\u201d In the last budget, George Osborne promised \u201cultrafast broadband\u201d of at least 100 megabits per second - five times the national average - to nearly all homes in the country. BT is also trialling a new technology called G.fast, which it says could deliver speeds of 500 megabits a second, five times as fast again. But TalkTalk, Vodafone and Sky have all complained that they will be competing on unfair terms with a rapidly expanding BT. Patterson has pushed the company into sports broadcasting, undermining Sky by giving away Premier League football for free to those who pay for BT broadband. This was followed by a big swoop on mobile. The company\u2019s \u00a312.5bn deal to acquire the EE mobile network was approved by shareholders in April and now awaits clearance from the Competition and Markets Authority. But Ofcom has called a wide-ranging review of the telecoms and pay TV sector and rivals are pushing for the BT-operated national broadband network to be hived off. Patterson said regulatory decisions might be better taken from Brussels rather than by UK national regulators such as Ofcom. \u201cThe case for deregulation is strong. You could take all regulation out of the UK and run it from the EU, but I suppose that depends on us still being part of the EU.\u201d Pre-tax profits were ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations, at \u00a33.17bn, an increase of 12%. BT has proposed a final dividend of 8.5p, up 13%. Stabilising the loss of phone and broadband lines to Sky and TalkTalk is key to improving BT\u2019s revenue and profits, and the company has justified its outlay on sports saying a better TV service will help retain customers. \u201cWe are very pleased with the performance of BT Sport which has contributed to both top and bottom-line growth,\u201d it said. Performance indicators show TV helped slow the rate of defections from BT\u2019s retail phone and broadband business throughout the 2013-2014 financial year, but line loss had increased in 2014-2015. The number of active consumer lines fell by 46,000 in the fourth quarter. They fell by only 25,000 in the same period last year but were down by 107,000 on two years ago. Analyst Paolo Pescatore at CCS Insight said: \u201cIt is clear that the company has made some big long term bets and as a result has made itself relevant again. There is undoubtedly a good vibe at BT and lots of excitement. Now it needs to keep on delivering.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The UK is following global markets lower, as the country votes in what is proving to be a very close general election.</p> <p>In the wake of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments about equity valuations being \u201cquite high\u201d, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 86 points while Asian markets dropped more than 1%. So European markets have started the day sharply lower, not helped by the continuing fall in bond markets. Bond yields have risen as the recent revival in the oil price prompted inflation fears, as well as suffering as the euro strengthens. Meanwhile signs of recovery in the eurozone - despite Greece\u2019s continuing problems - have prompted talk that the European Central Bank might end its bond buying QE programme early, thus removing another prop for bond prices.</p> <p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently down 76.23 points at 6857.51, its lowest level for exactly a month.</p> <p>Among the risers <strong>RSA Insurance</strong> is up 8.6p at 426.6p as the company reported a 1% year on year rise in first quarter net premiums, offsetting the impact of low interest rates and adverse currency movements. Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RSA\u2019s first quarter statement was mixed \u200ein our view, with further progress at the strategic level, especially with disposals (Singapore &amp; Hong Kong disposals completed in the quarter). The underlying current year loss ratio has improved but was still behind its own plans and large losses still remaining elevated, with weather losses lower than in the first quarter of 2014. </p> <p>We reiterate our hold recommendation, highlighting the around 33% premium to our 2015 forecast net tangible asset value of 315p and little income attractions in the short to medium term, at possibly around 2% for 2015 (versus 8p). The struggle continues. </p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Aviva</strong> has slipped 2.5p to 511p despite a 14% rise in new business.</p> <p><strong>Morrisons </strong>is leading the losers, down 12.5p at 176.8p as the supermarket group reported a 2.9% fall in first quarter like for like sales, compared to a 2.6% decline in the fourth quarter last year.</p> <p><strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> has fallen 45.5p to \u00a314.69 in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s results and news that it had cancelled its planned flotation of its HIV business.</p> <p>A number of companies went ex-dividend with <strong>G4S</strong> down 8.6p at 282.4p and <strong>Admiral </strong>down 2% at \u00a314.89.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Telecity</strong> has jumped nearly 19% to \u00a310.68 after the data centre group opened talks with US business Equinix about a \u00a32.3bn takeover, casting doubt on Telecity\u2019s proposed deal to buy Interxion Holdings. Investec analyst Roger Phillips said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Equinix bid looks fully priced and we view there as being only an outside chance of a counterbid from another player or from private equity. Anti-trust concerns are an unknown, considering the strength of a combined Equinix-Telecity player in Europe. The prospect of applying the Equinix cross-connect pricing model to the Telecity estate could exacerbate this. We remain at hold and expect the shares to trade at a modest discount to the 1145p offer price, helped by short interest closing. </p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "The UK is following global markets lower, as the country votes in what is proving to be a very close general election. In the wake of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments about equity valuations being \u201cquite high\u201d, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 86 points while Asian markets dropped more than 1%. So European markets have started the day sharply lower, not helped by the continuing fall in bond markets. Bond yields have risen as the recent revival in the oil price prompted inflation fears, as well as suffering as the euro strengthens. Meanwhile signs of recovery in the eurozone - despite Greece\u2019s continuing problems - have prompted talk that the European Central Bank might end its bond buying QE programme early, thus removing another prop for bond prices. So the FTSE 100 is currently down 76.23 points at 6857.51, its lowest level for exactly a month. Among the risers RSA Insurance is up 8.6p at 426.6p as the company reported a 1% year on year rise in first quarter net premiums, offsetting the impact of low interest rates and adverse currency movements. Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said: RSA\u2019s first quarter statement was mixed \u200ein our view, with further progress at the strategic level, especially with disposals (Singapore &amp; Hong Kong disposals completed in the quarter). The underlying current year loss ratio has improved but was still behind its own plans and large losses still remaining elevated, with weather losses lower than in the first quarter of 2014. We reiterate our hold recommendation, highlighting the around 33% premium to our 2015 forecast net tangible asset value of 315p and little income attractions in the short to medium term, at possibly around 2% for 2015 (versus 8p). The struggle continues. But Aviva has slipped 2.5p to 511p despite a 14% rise in new business. Morrisons is leading the losers, down 12.5p at 176.8p as the supermarket group reported a 2.9% fall in first quarter like for like sales, compared to a 2.6% decline in the fourth quarter last year. GlaxoSmithKline has fallen 45.5p to \u00a314.69 in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s results and news that it had cancelled its planned flotation of its HIV business. A number of companies went ex-dividend with G4S down 8.6p at 282.4p and Admiral down 2% at \u00a314.89. Among the mid-caps Telecity has jumped nearly 19% to \u00a310.68 after the data centre group opened talks with US business Equinix about a \u00a32.3bn takeover, casting doubt on Telecity\u2019s proposed deal to buy Interxion Holdings. Investec analyst Roger Phillips said: The Equinix bid looks fully priced and we view there as being only an outside chance of a counterbid from another player or from private equity. Anti-trust concerns are an unknown, considering the strength of a combined Equinix-Telecity player in Europe. The prospect of applying the Equinix cross-connect pricing model to the Telecity estate could exacerbate this. We remain at hold and expect the shares to trade at a modest discount to the 1145p offer price, helped by short interest closing.",

      "bodyText": "The government was handed a last-minute election boost after the last major piece of economic news before the polls signalled a booming UK services sector, easing fears of a sharp slowdown in the wider economy. Growth in the sector, which accounts for roughly three-quarters of the UK economy and includes areas such as bars, restaurants and transport, was stronger than economists predicted, hitting an eight-month high in April. The headline index of the Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) \u2013 broadly reflecting activity in the sector \u2013 rose to 59.5 in April, from 58.9 in March, where anything above 5o signals growth. It extended the run of uninterrupted services industry growth to 28 months, the longest in seven years. David Cameron seized on the positive data, a day before the UK goes to the polls: The services PMI followed much weaker-than-expected equivalent surveys from the manufacturing and construction industries, which showed parts of the economy are struggling and triggered concerns that the UK recovery was faltering. Businesses in those sectors reported customers delaying spending while uncertainty persists over the outcome of Thursday\u2019s election. The pound rose against the dollar after the services survey was published, up 0.5% to more than $1.52, as investors were cheered by signs that the UK recovery was not about to be derailed. The pound had slumped by about 3 cents from highs late last week, as concern mounted among traders about an inconclusive election outcome. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \u201cFears of the economy slumping amid election jitters are allayed as an upturn in service sector activity has helped offset sharp slowdowns in both manufacturing and construction.\u201d Williamson said that taken together, the three PMI surveys for April suggested the economy was growing at a rate of 0.8% at the beginning of the second quarter. Official data last week showed growth in the first quarter halved unexpectedly to 0.3%, much worse than expected, after the services industry was the only major sector to grow. Despite the brighter outlook suggested by the April services PMI, Williamson said there were \u201cwarning lights flashing\u201d about the sustainability of the recovery. \u201cAny new government is faced with the challenge of boosting business confidence and reviving investment in particular,\u201d he added. UK growth remains heavily reliant on the consumer, despite government ambitions for a manufacturing and export-led recovery. More than six years on from the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008, the services industry is the only key sector of the UK economy where output has surpassed its pre-crisis peak. Economists said that despite the strong services PMI, there was no immediate prospect of an rise in interest rates, with inflation currently at zero. The Bank of England will announce its May policy decision on Monday.",

      "bodyText": "With the polls so tight, traders are unsure how to position themselves. A whole host of scenarios have been considered for the election aftermath. So once some kind of result is in, how best to gauge what investors make of it? Ian Stewart, chief UK economist at Deloitte, has come up with some key indicators to watch on Friday and the days that follow. We pick out five here. Deloitte\u2019s latest survey of chief financial officers at big companies highlighted their fears over policy shakeups, following the election. The second biggest source of anxiety was the potential turmoil of a vote on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, as promised by David Cameron. Stewart comments: There are three concerns for markets and businesses after the election. One fear is a breakdown of what was thought to be a consensus about deficit reduction. The second is accretion of regulation and tax, so a re-setting of micro-economic policy to the left, and the third thing is Brexit.\u201d His top indicators to watch include: 1. Market expectations for interest rates The lines show where traders expect three-month interest rates \u2013 which run at similar levels to base rates \u2013 to be at the end of this year, next year, 2017 and 2018. As the chart shows, over the past year, financial markets have lowered their expectations for interest rates. Stewart notes: If the general election ushers in sustained political uncertainty that seems likely to weigh on growth, market expectations for interest rates are likely to drop further. Conversely, if the new government were decisively to break with austerity and seek to boost the economy through more public spending, interest rate expectations are likely to rise.\u201d 2. Mortgage rates Similar to market expectations for base rates, as set by the Bank of England, mortgage rates are likely to move, depending on the election outcome. 3. FTSE 100 The index of leading London-listed shares, the FTSE 100, is near an all-time high. There are fears that an inconclusive outcome could knock confidence. Some analysts have warned that a Labour government, or Labour-led coalition, could put shares in banks, bookmakers and energy companies under pressure. Meanwhile, the prospect of an EU referendum under the Conservatives could knock the whole index back, analysts warn. 4. Foreign exchange volatility This is a measure of uncertainty in the foreign exchange market for sterling. \u201cIf the election \u2013 as seems quite likely \u2013 delivers no clear winner, and a period of deal-making as parties try to build viable alliances, this measure is likely to rise,\u201d says Stewart. 5. Gilt-Bund spread This shows the gap between the yield, or interest rate, on benchmark 10-year UK government bonds (gilts) and on 10-year German government bonds (Bunds). Both Bunds and gilts have been seen as safe-haven investments in these recent times of instability in the eurozone. So their yields are lower than the equivalent interest rates on French, Spanish and other bonds (yields move inversely to the price of a bond. So a lower yield indicates higher demand). Yields on gilts are higher than yields on Bunds and the gap between the two has widened since 2012, as shown in the chart. Looking at the gap, or spread, between Bund and gilt yields gives an indication of (among other things) the relative risks investors attach to each economy and ultimately each government\u2019s credit-worthiness. If the spread widens, for example, it shows investors have a preference for owning German government bonds relative to gilts. In the election aftermath, this is one to watch but will not necessarily be easy to interpret. If spreads were to increase markedly following the election result, this could be interpreted as a sign of: a) Improved confidence in the UK\u2019s growth outlook, therefore an expectation of rising interest rates b) Concerns that a lack of fiscal tightening will usher in higher base rates or cause growing worries about the UK\u2019s credit-worthiness c) Higher risk premia on the back of growing political uncertainty related to the prospect of minority governments and the risk of another election.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian workforce shed more jobs than expected in April, official figures showed on Thursday, dealing a blow to treasurer Joe Hockey ahead of next week\u2019s budget. The number of people employed decreased by 2,900 to 11,724,600 in April driven by a fall in full-time work for men (down 47,900) and part-time employment for women (down 10,700), the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. Economists had predicted a rise of 10,000. The jobless rate increased 0.1 percentage points to 6.2% compared with March. The poor numbers will increase the pressure on Hockey to introduce measures to boost jobs in his budget on Tuesday. However, Hockey will be encouraged that the estimates for the number of people in work in March were revised upwards with 10,000 more people in work than previously believed. It means the economy added nearly 50,000 new roles in March, according to the ABS, but some observers said doubt remained about the reliability of the figures. The ABS was forced to withdraw its data for July and August last year and the federal government pledged more resources for the bureau. The statistical adjustment helped the Australian dollar recover from an initial sell-off on the release of the figures. It was trading at US79.7c at midday. Hockey will also note that the trend growth in employment was up. The labour force participation rate remained steady in April at 64.8% while the aggregate monthly hours worked increased in April 2015, up 17.8m hours (1.1%) to 1,651.9m hours. The number of people unemployed increased by 7,000 to 769,500 in April 2015. This was driven by people who looked for part-time work only, which increased by 9,800 to 228,000. All figures are seasonally adjusted. JP Morgan economist Ben Jarman said April\u2019s jobs data represented a \u201csmall pullback\u201d after March\u2019s surprisingly positive result. \u201cGenerally when you have gross domestic product growing below its potential rate you expect to see the unemployment rate rising,\u201d Jarman said. \u201cThe fact that it went up marginally is consistent with the economy a little bit below its potential rate, but not dramatically.\u201d He said the small increase in the unemployment rate was in line with the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s decision to cut rates by 0.25 percentage points on Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken that decision to give things a helpful nudge along.\u201d",
