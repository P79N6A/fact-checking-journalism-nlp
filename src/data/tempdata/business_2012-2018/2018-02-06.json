      "bodyText": "Time for a recap, after another hectic day in the markets. The US stock market has roared back from its slump on Monday, in a highly volatile trading session. After initially sliding, the Dow Jones industrial average ended the day with its biggest jump in over a year - up 567 points. Cue smiles on Wall Street between relieved traders. The rally came as several analysts argued that the markets were going through a correction, not embarking on a crash. The US government also tried to calm nerves, with Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin arguing that the markets were functioning well. European stock markets, though, suffered heavy falls. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 endured its biggest slump since the Brexit vote, falling by 193 points or 2.6% -- wiping \u00a350bn off the index. Asian markets also tumbled on Tuesday -- but there are signs that they will recover in the upcoming trading session. Australia\u2019s benchmark index is being called higher. But the bigger picture is that the markets look nervous, with investors worrying about potential US interest rate rises. With $4 trillion wiped off shares in the last week, further volatility seems highly likely in the days ahead. That\u2019s probably all from us today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s our latest news story on the markets: Goodnight! What a difference a day makes. Traders on the floor of the New York stock exchange are grinning and sharing high fives, after seeing shares recover this afternoon. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, has commented on the US stock markets - and insisted that America\u2019s economy is robust. Sanders says: \u201cLook, the economy is incredibly strong right now. The president\u2019s focus right now continues to be on the long term economic fundamentals which, like I just said, are very strong in this country. We\u2019re infinitely better off today than we were before the president took office, particularly on the economy. We have historically low unemployment and we actually have increasing wages for American workers. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that\u2019s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago and we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are right now.\u201d Sanders added: \u201cDoes the president have second thoughts about taking credit for a booming economy? Absolutely not.\u201d Today\u2019s rally is the S&amp;P 500\u2019s best one-day gain, in percentage terms, since November 2016. Quite a recovery, given it had its worst day in six years yesterday. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 closing market report: U.S. stocks posted sharp gains in another wild trading session on Tuesday, as indexes rebounded from the biggest one-day drops for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow in more than six years that stalled the market\u2019s record run. Stocks swung from negative to positive after indexes started the session 2% lower, underscoring a return of volatility to a market that until recently was marked by an absence of major shifts. The Dow had a more than 1,100-point difference between its high and low on Tuesday. The sharp declines in recent days marked a pullback that had been long awaited by investors after the market minted record high after record high in a relatively calm ascent. \u201cDespite violent moves in the last couple days in the market, fundamentals in the economy are very strong and it\u2019s not just the U.S., it\u2019s throughout the global economy,\u201d said Alicia Levine, head of global investment strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 567.02 points, or 2.33%, to 24,912.77, the S&amp;P 500 gained 46.2 points, or 1.74%, to 2,695.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 148.36 points, or 2.13%, to 7,115.88. Technology, materials and consumer discretionary were the top-performing sectors on Tuesday. Defensive sectors utilities and real estate were the only major S&amp;P groups to end negative. The Dow\u2019s revival was led by chemicals firm Dow DuPont, retail chain Home Depot, tech giant Apple and oil producer Chevron, which all gained at least 4%. BREAKING: The US stock market has bounced from its worst day in six years. As the closing bell rings out across the New York stock exchange, the Dow Jones is up around 567 points, or 2.33%. It\u2019s quite a swing, given the Dow fell over 500-points at the start of trading today. That means it has recovered around half Monday\u2019s 1,175-point rout. The broader S&amp;P 500 also bounced back, as did the tech-focused Nasdaq. Investors will be relieved that shares haven\u2019t suffered further losses today. But...there\u2019s no argument that volatility is back, after a long period of calm in the financial markets. With just a few minutes trading left, Wall Street has managed to recover its poise. The Dow and the Nasdaq are both up over 2%. Fact of the day.... John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Financial of North Carolina sums up the day: \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy period and today the market is probably just trying to find some footing.\u201d In a stark contrast to yesterday\u2019s wobbles, the Dow just surged by 600 points -- suggesting we could recover half of Monday\u2019s losses... Can the Dow hang on? With 30 minutes to go, the US stock market is up... but not so strongly that a late slump can be ruled out. Here\u2019s our colleague Philip Inman on today\u2019s market action: Shares in London plunged for a sixth day and by the largest amount since the Brexit vote, as concerns grew that febrile global stock markets, which have lost $4tn (\u00a32.9tn) in value since Friday, were in the grip of panic-selling. The FTSE 100 slumped 2.6% to 7,141 to wipe all the gains from this year\u2019s trading and set the index of Britain\u2019s most valuable companies on course for a second week of losses. Investors took fright elsewhere in Europe, with markets in Germany, France and Spain all closing down by more than 2%. Stocks also tumbled across Asia earlier in the day. The Tokyo Nikkei 225 index was among the worst affected after shares fell by more than 4% to 21,620, leaving them 12% down on last month\u2019s peak of 24,120. Wall Street, where the global stock market rout began on Monday, had a second day of volatile, high volume trading with wild swings in share prices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 2.2% following the opening bell before recovering within half an hour to a gain of more than 1%, then see-sawing further through the session.... One reason the Australian market is set to bounce back is that another record half-yearly profit is expected from Commonwealth Bank, the country\u2019s biggest company. It is forecast by analysts to announce six-month earnings of about A$5.2 billion \u2013 up 6% \u2013 despite its regulatory woes. The Australian banking sector is enormous and has benefited from the country\u2019s extended house prices boom, although there are signs that is stalling. The big four retail banks - Commonwealth, Westpac, ANZ and NAB \u2013 together with Macquarie Bank make up a whopping 25% of the ASX200. So, after shedding a record 1,175 points last night, the Dow is on track to recover a significant chunk of them...... The S&amp;P 500 is also putting on a late spurt. The Dow is continuing to rise in late trading - now up 504 points, or over 2%, at 24,850. There are signs that Asia-Pacific markets will rally on Wednesday. Australia\u2019s ASX200 benchmark has lost A$85bn in value in two days but is set to bounce back on Wednesday, according to futures trading. It is expected to rise around 1.25% at the opening bell at 10am Sydney time, which is 11pm GMT (or two hours after Wall Street closes) The rally is back on again! As Wall Street enters its final hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average is making a late charge. The Dow is now up 370 points, or 1.45% at 24,716. A lot of experts have argued today that the current selloff is just a much-needed correction, not the start of a crash. But our financial editor, Nils Pratley, isn\u2019t convinced by this breezy optimism. Instead, he highlights several reasons to be worried. For example: The past couple of days have shown one thing \u2013 that there was an awful lot of money betting on tranquillity via various financial products manufactured by investment banks. Did a wipeout of some of these low-volatility funds feed the selling pressures on Monday? Almost certainly. But is that \u201ctechnical\u201d factor a temporary sideshow that can be ignored? Not necessarily. It may be evidence that other risks have been packaged up and sold as \u201clow risk\u201d when they\u2019re actually the reverse. When investors are fed cheap money for a decade, dumb bets can be made. Plus, the prelude to the drama was a rapid rise in the yield on 10-year US treasuries from 2.4% to 2.8%. This, we are told, happened because the strong news on jobs and wages means the US Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates three times this year. That explanation is entirely plausible. But a 10-year yield of 2.8% is still low by historical standards. What would something more normal \u2013 say, 4% \u2013 do? If the deflation dragon really has been slain and the Trump administration is dishing out tax cuts, isn\u2019t 4% a possibility? On the evidence of the past week, the stock market may not adjust easily. More here: Wall Street continues to see-saw, and with 90 minutes trading left the main indices are in the red. The S&amp;P 500 has shed 0.5% (on top of Monday\u2019s 4.1% fall), while the Dow remains pretty volatile - currently down 0.2%. Investors continue to blame the prospect of rising US interest rates, and signs that wages are finally picking up. As Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, puts it (via the FT): I still think this is a continued reaction to the very rapid rise in interest rates and inflation expectations over a short period of time. We are just seeing some continued selling after a very long period of a complacent environment.\u201d Some of the world\u2019s richest people are a little less rich today, thanks to yesterday\u2019s market mayhem. Bloomberg has calculated that Warren Buffett, the veteran investor, lost $5.1bn on Monday. But that won\u2019t stop him buying a can of his favourite cherry coke, as the Sage of Omaha is still worth $85bn. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg took the second-biggest hit - losing $3.6bn, with Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos close behind. More here. Update: Dow now down 85 points. Back in London, traders are counting the damage after the FTSE 100 suffered its biggest one-day fall since the Brexit vote. Financial stocks had a bad day, with Standard Life and Schroders down over 5%. Utility stocks also suffered - National Grid and United Utilities lost over 4%. Healthcare and technology also brought up the rear. The Evening Standard has worked out that \u00a350bn was wiped off the value of companies on the Footsie today, as the index shed 193 points or 2.6%. After Monday\u2019s wild drama, and today\u2019s losses in Asia and Europe, shares are finally looking calmer. The Dow is now bobbing around its opening levels, as traders take a breather and try to anticipate the market\u2019s next move. But don\u2019t relax! Wall Street has a habit of becoming more volatile towards the end of the day\u2019s session. So with two hours to go, we could yet see big gains or losses. And.... the Dow has turned negative again  , down 35 points. Travelers Companies, the insurance group, is currently the biggest faller, down 2.6%. Oil giant Exxonis down 2.5%, followed by pharma group Merck (-2.15%) and Coca-Cola (-1.85%) Having been up, and down, and up, and down, the Dow Jones is currently 100 points higher today (+0.4) at 24,446. But trading remains jittery, so do not try this at home (or in the office!): Here\u2019s investor and businessman Carl Icahn on the markets, courtesy CNBC: IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld has added his voice to those saying the economic fundamentals are strong despite the current market turmoil. If Wall Street seems incapable of deciding which direction to stick with, there was no such hesitation in Europe. With the global concerns about rising interest rates and a spate of catching up with Monday\u2019s slump in the Dow, European markets have suffered deep declines. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 193.58 points or 2.64% to 7141.40, its biggest daily percentage decline since the Brexit vote Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.32% to 12,392.66 France\u2019s Cac closed down 2.35% at 5161.81 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.08% to 22,347.01 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.53% lower at 9810.0 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.74% to 838.80 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 201 points or 0.79% while the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.2 points or 0.08%. The sell-off in stock markets does not relate to economic fundamentals, agrees City Index market analyst Fiona Cincotta: Whipsaw action is sending equity indices on a wild ride on Tuesday. As the bulls battle the bears US stocks have opened trading a wide range. The Dow had moved through 934 points early on as investors were keen to pick up bargains but fear that it is still too early to call the bottom.... The CBOE volatility Index, also known as the VIX, or fear gauge remains at elevated levels on Tuesday spiking to 50 before retracing back to 40, an increase of 7% on the day. Stepping back from the trading ranges and looking at the levels that Wall Street is trading at and suddenly it is possible to gain some perspective on the numbers. The Dow is at 24,423 (now up on the day) trading at a level that was last seen just two months ago. This sell off has been a technical phenomenon, there has not been a change in fundamentals. Right now, this is offering little comfort to traders looking to buy the dips and being wiped out by automated selling. Here, from our colleagues in New York, is a quick run through some of the reasons for the current stock market uncertainty: The stock market falls should have little impact on the overall global economy, say Capital Economics. Its chief global economist Andrew Kenningham said: The slump in equity markets would have to go a lot further to cause economic growth to slow significantly. That may yet happen, but for now prospects for global growth still look fairly bright. The fall in global equity prices over the past few days has been unusually sudden, but it is not yet exceptionally large. The MSCI World equity index has fallen by 6% from its peak last week. As a comparison, there have been four instances of double-digit percentage falls in the index since the financial crisis. These occurred in 2010 (-15%), 2011 (-20%), 2012 (-13%) and 2015/16 (-17%). It is of course quite possible that equities will fall much further in the coming days or weeks, or even hours! After all, valuations are high by past standards and the MSCI World index is still 17% above its level a year ago. But even if this happens, the fallout for the economy may still be quite small. ... Stock markets often send a false signal about the outlook for economic growth. And there has been only a small increase in corporate bond yields, which have a better track record in signalling slowdowns. The most reliable leading indicators of economic activity, such as the global PMIs and the US ISM non-manufacturing index published yesterday, suggest that the world economy is firing on all cylinders. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 2.64% or 193 points to its lowest level since last April. This is the biggest percentage drop since the day after the UK referendum on Europe, and marks the sixth successive trading day of declines. The Dow\u2019s uncertainty continues, and it is now down 141 points. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 started the day very much offside, and then managed to drive into positive territory only to slip back again.... Traders don\u2019t know which way to turn as uncertainty is running high. The colossal range on the US indices sum up how irrational equity traders are at the moment, and while some go bargain hunting, others are fearful we could see another leg lower. The S&amp;P 500 by the way is down 12 points or 0.44%. The current market sell off is just a correction, said Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, but he also told senators that algorithmic trading had an impact. He told the House Financial Services Committee that markets were functioning very well, although the administration was monitoring the situation. He said he was not overly concerned about the recent sell-off, and that market fundamentals were strong. There were no financial stability implications in the recent market moves, he added. Here\u2019s a graph showing the volatility in the Dow Jones Industrial Average so far today: And there appears to be real trading out there. Volumes are around 250m compared to an average of about 139m, which appears to be the highest since the December Federal Reserve meeting (H/T Neil Wilson of ETX Capital). It\u2019s been a chaotic start on Wall Street, says Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell. And with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 170 points, it is hard to disagree. Campbell says: The Dow was all over the place after the bell. With the futures promising the index was going to spill its guts, it was a welcome relief that the index instead quickly shifted into the green. The index is still pretty damn volatile, however.... It\u2019s also worth noting that the Dow did something similar yesterday, ducking an immediate bloodbath only to completely lose its bottle by the end of the session. Elsewhere, the Vix volatility index has fallen back sharply (ironic, given how volatile the Dow is at the moment). After hitting a level of 50 earlier, the Vix is now down 33% on the day at 24.7. The Dow is all over the place. After the initial 550 point fall and the subsequent 350 point rise, the Dow is now up just 50 points or so. What it will close at is anyone\u2019s guess, but the recent falls do seem to have attracted some buyers. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The valuations were certainly looking attractive on a forward earnings basis, providing attract entry points for a number of stocks. Some deep-pocketed funds may have stepped in to hoover up what they could \u2013 in this context it looks for the time being like the correction was exactly what the market needed \u2013 although we have a long way to go today still and sentiment is still fragile after two bruising sessions. The White House, and specifically the recent tax cuts, have played a part in the current market volatility, says Royal London Asset Management: US stock market volatility continues to spike higher as the strongest wage inflation in the US since 2009 triggered fears of faster than expected rises in interest rates. While Donald Trump\u2019s White House has correctly pointed to strong economic fundamentals as a more important long term story and the role of the tax cuts in driving this, they\u2019ve failed to appreciate the impact that their policies could have on inflation, and therefore the path of interest rates. Royal London\u2019s head of multi asset Trevor Greetham added: Investors welcomed the announcements of tax cuts but are starting to get second thoughts as the consequences of adding stimulus late in the business cycle become clear. Unemployment is low and the potential for strong wage inflation once US tax cuts take effect has spooked markets, given what this means for US interest rate policy. Although rising interest rates pose a challenge to the stock market, this will only become a serious one once they are high enough to cause the economy to roll over. With the Fed Funds rate still below the level of core inflation in the US, that could take quite a while. We expect bouts of volatility like this to become more common now the Federal Reserve is in play, but expect stocks to recover over the coming weeks and months, making recent market moves look like an overreaction. The early recovery in US markets gives some credence to those who believe the recent falls were a much needed market correction rather than the precursor to a wider sell-off. One of those is Sven Balzer, head of investment strategy at Coutts: This week\u2019s stock market falls show a much needed market correction after a long period of strong performance, and little more. Global economic growth remains strong and there are no signs of a US recession, which usually heralds a wider sell-off... In our view, this is a short-term correction driven by technical factors rather than concerns about the underlying economic picture or corporate health. While this can be unnerving for investors, we see a robust economic and corporate environment that should continue to support equities. Go Wall Street! Instead of sinking into the mire, the Dow is now up 350 points, or 1.4%. That means leading shares have recovered around a third of Monday\u2019s tumble. Although the Dow Jones industrial average gets a lot of attention, serious stock market traders pay more attention to the S&amp;P 500. That\u2019s because it contains more companies (500, instead of the Dow\u2019s 30), so it\u2019s a better measure of the actual US stock market. And after an early wobble, the S&amp;P 500 is now positive too -- up 1% or 27 points at 2,676 points. Wall Street is fighting back! After Monday\u2019s wild swings, the Dow has clawed back its opening falls - and is now up 0.13%. That doesn\u2019t make much of a dent in yesterday\u2019s rout, but investors will be relieved that it\u2019s not worse. Still early days though! After a rocky start, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has turned positive. Things are settling down on Wall Street. After six minutes trading, the Dow is now down 157 points -- perhaps traders are resisting the temptation to sell everything. DING DING goes the opening bell of Wall Street, triggering another wave of selling. The Dow Jones industrial average has swiftly shed 547 points, a fall of 2.25%, on top of Monday\u2019s 1,175 slide. That takes the Dow into correction territory, down more than 10% from its peak. But...the index is swiftly rebounding from those lows, as traders get stuck in. More to follow! Right. Deep breath time. After its biggest sell-off in six years, Wall Street is about to reopen. The futures market is still jittery, as traders try to anticipate the market\u2019s next move. Just seven minutes to go...... Veteran City analyst George Magnus has a deeply worrying take. He thinks markets are wobbling because the US government\u2019s budget deficit is likely to spike over the next couple of years. That\u2019s because the new Tax Cut and Jobs Act will force Washington to borrow much more to balance its books -- at a time when the economy should be strong (so borrowing should be low). Magnus writes: Trillion dollar deficits are just over the horizon, which will cause US government debt as a share of GDP to rise in the next several years to over 100 per cent. While debt levels alone cannot predict what will happen to bond yields, the markets fear that significant unfunded government borrowing\u2014especially when the economy is doing well\u2014will cause the Federal Reserve to carry on raising interest rates, in turn pushing bond yields higher. On current trends, this cyclical shift will eventually, maybe in 2019, puncture the stock market, corporate profits, and most likely the economy. More here: With 20 minutes until the Wall Street open, a chunky sell-off still looks likely.... Bears are running rampant through the global markets today, following Monday\u2019s rout on Wall Street, says Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM. He questions whether the recent losses are merely a \u2018healthy correction\u2019, as some investors claim. A sense of anxiety amongst investors over central banks raising interest rates faster than expected, remains one of the likely culprits behind the global sell-off. In Asia, equities were a sea of red during early trade and the negative domino effect has already punished European markets. With Wall Street suffering its largest one-day decline in more than six years on Monday, US stocks could remain depressed this afternoon. Ongoing weakness across stock markets may prompt investors to start questioning if the global sell-off could be more than a correction but something greater. Take a deep breath, stock market traders. The opening of Wall Street is 50 minutes away, and heavy falls look likely: Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, says the financial markets are adjusting to a new world where central bankers aren\u2019t propping assets up through loose monetary policy. He writes: Interest rates are rising at a time when the economy needs money for the increased corporate investment activity which is taking place. That means there won\u2019t be the constant flow of money into the equity market which has been supporting prices over the last couple of years. As I said before the year ended, the real challenge for investors after an environment of very low volatility is that they may be unnerved as it \u201cnormalises\u201d. More volatility means more opportunity for active investors with strong nerves. We see the recent sell off as validating rather than challenging that assessment\u201d Newsflash: America\u2019s trade deficit has widened to its highest level since the financial crisis. New figures from the Commerce Department show that the US imported $53.1bn more than it exported in December 2017, an increase of 5.3%. That\u2019s the biggest monthly deficit since 2008. The data also show that America\u2019s trade gap with China hit a new all-time high of over $375bn for 2017, despite Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to cut it as part of his America First agenda. Traders on Wall Street are expecting fresh losses when the market opens in around 90 minutes time. Yesterday\u2019s 1,175-point slump on the Dow has left many traders bruised and nervous, as the long run of calm market conditions comes to an abrupt halt. Volatility is continuing to rise today, to levels not seen since August 2015 -- adding to the anxiety in New Jork. Andre Bakhos, managing director of New Vines Capital, has told Reuters that fear is stalking the markets. \u201cThe one thing I could say with confidence is that volatility has suddenly come back into the market. \u201cThe declines in markets are steep and vicious and are fostering a feeling of fear which begets irrational behavior. So this market is now driven on fear of rates and [rising] wages. That basically means good news now is bad news. \u201cThe volatility has caused investors to be fast on their feet. It is a true traders\u2019 atmosphere as opposed to the conditions we have been accustomed to - buy and go higher.\u201d The turmoil in the markets today has disrupted Greece\u2019s plans to issue a new government bond. That seven-year bond was an important stage in Athens\u2019 escape from its bailout programme. Our correspondent Helena Smith in Athens explains: Barely 24 hours after the mandate was announced, it was decided not to push ahead with what would have been the debt-stricken country\u2019s boldest market foray in almost eight years under international bailout programmes. It was assumed the seven-year issue would price today but one lead manager said: \u201cwe felt it would be prudent to wait for some stability. Greece doesn\u2019t do deals very often and wants to make sure it works.\u201d Athens had hoped to raise \u20ac3bn. The country is due to exit its current EU-IMF bailout programme \u2013 its third since May 2010 \u2013 in August and has pledged to make several market forays in order to build up a cash buffer of up to \u20ac19bn to cover debt repayments once the programme officially expires. It\u2019s shaping up for a rough opening on Wall Street..... Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says we\u2019re looking at a stock market correction - not a crash. He argues that America\u2019s new top central banker, Jerome Powell, won\u2019t stay on the sidelines for long. If the selloff continues, surely Powell\u2019s Federal Reserve will wind back the tightening of monetary policy (the equivalent of pouring a bit more gin into the punch bowl). Larry argues: Trump has a lot riding on the stock market continuing to rise and certainly did not choose Jerome Powell to be the chairman of the Fed because he thought his appointee was an interest-rate hawk. The falls on Wall Street were triggered by last week\u2019s labour market report, which showed unemployment at 4.1% and a pick-up in average hourly earnings. But Powell would not have to look all that hard to find reasons for a gradual, market-pleasing, rise in interest rates rather than an aggressive tightening. If the current turmoil continues, Powell will no doubt seek to reassure the markets. If this all sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it is. During Alan Greenspan\u2019s long reign at the Fed, Wall Street knew the central bank would ride to the rescue every time share prices plunged. It became known as \u201cthe Greenspan put\u201d. The problem for Powell is that the Greenspan put was ultimately disastrous. It encouraged recklessness, ever bigger bubbles and the crash to end all crashes Every share on the FTSE 100 index is now down, as traders hunker down ahead of the Wall Street open in two hours time... James Andrews, head of investment management at City firm Redmayne Bentley, reckons that the global selloff will abate soon. He argues that investors have over-reacted to last week\u2019s jump in US wages (which arguably makes rising inflation and higher interest rates more likely). Andrews says: \u201cThis isn\u2019t to say the volatility can\u2019t continue, as we have had a phase of very low volatility and some profit taking is natural following a prolonged period of exceptional returns. However, given the positive fundamentals around the globe currently, it feels like any market pull-back should be relatively short in nature at this time until we see a material change in global interest rates, and therefore the return on cash and less risky assets, not to mention a less favourable outlook for companies globally.\u201d Here\u2019s Reuters latest market update: World stock markets nosedived for a fourth day running on Tuesday, having seen $4 trillion wiped off from what just eight days ago had been record high values. Europe\u2019s main bourses were down around 2 percent, leaving investors with little option but to seek traditional refuges such as gold and one of the initial triggers for the selloff - benchmark government bonds. Wall Street futures offered a chink of light as they turned higher in Europe but commodities remained gloomy, with oil and industrial metals all tumbling backwards as the year\u2019s upbeat start for markets soured rapidly. \u201cPlaytime is officially over, kids,\u201d analysts at Rabobank said. \u201cRising volatility painfully reminds some investors that one-way bets don\u2019t exist.\u201d European stock markets are heading lower as lunchtime approaches, as investors fear another day of losses on Wall Street. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is now down 180 points, or 2.5%, heading close to this morning\u2019s one-year low. That\u2019s because the futures market is now indicating fresh losses in New York when the market opens (at 2.30pm UK time, or 8.30am on the East Coast). Right now, the S&amp;P 500 index (which covers the major US companies) is predicted to fall 1% - on top of Monday\u2019s 4% slide. The Dow is also being called lower - it could shed 400 points at the open, following yesterday\u2019s 1,175 rout. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says investors will be glued to the Wall Street open, to get their next cue for where global markets are headed. He adds: Futures have been all over the place this morning but seem to be settling lower, ready to push through another run of levels on the downside. It\u2019s been a rough day for traders around the globe, as today\u2019s correction has gathered pace. Oh dear. Investors who had bet on low market volatility by putting money into that XIV security have been discussing their losses on Reddit. One claims to have lost $4m, due to the surge in volatility yesterday, while other small traders are nursing smaller, but painful, losses. The Dow Jones futures price has been flailing around since Wall Street closed 14 hours ago: Update: The FTSE 100 is currently down 150 points, or 2%, at 7183 points. That\u2019s the lowest level since April 2017, but a recovery on this morning\u2019s one-year low (when the FTSE fell 250 points). Nicholas Brooks, Head of Economic and Investment Research at Intermediate Capital Group, says the sell-off seems to be easing off.... for the moment. The equity market corrections of the past few days were overdue and not unexpected. The sell-off appears to be abating at the moment, with US government yields having dropped back to pre-correction levels and market indices and futures bouncing, but changes in market positioning and technicals make short-term predictions of market direction particularly difficult. Volatility in the world\u2019s financial markets has soared in recent days, bringing a long period of calm to an abrupt end. The CBOE VIX index, commonly known as the Wall Street \u2018fear index\u2019, has jumped by 14% this morning to 42.62, a gain of 5.3 points. That\u2019s the highest level since August 2015 (when worries over China\u2019s economy rocked the markets). Yesterday the VIX more than doubled, as shares slumped in London, New York, and then across Asia. It has only closed higher on three previous occasions. This surge in volatility is bad news for speculators who had wagered that markets would remain calm. But how would you place such a bet?.... Well, Credit Suisse has the answer. It offers a financial product called the \u201cinverse VIX\u201d, which rises when volatility falls -- and allows traders to profit from calm markets. Last night\u2019s drama has sparked fears that some hedge funds will be sitting on heavy losses on their XIV holdings, which they weren\u2019t able to unravel. Credit Suisse has said this morning that it hasn\u2019t incurred any trading losses on its inverse VIX product. But surely someone has lost money? After all, the XIV fell heavily in after-hours trading. CNBC has more details. Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades, says the stock markets love affair with Donald Trump is over. Rather than revelling in Trump\u2019s tax cuts, investors are now focusing on the inflationary impact, and the likely surge in government borrowing to cover the shortfall in revenue. He writes: We are seeing the biggest correction for well over a year on the stock markets but it\u2019s too early to call this a crash. In the last few years indices followed a strong bullish trend and so far, this is nothing more than a physiological correction. The violence of the fall seen in the US on Friday and Monday has to be kept in the context of the huge growth of Dow Jones and Wall Street in the last few years. For Trump however, the long honeymoon between him and the stock markets is well and truly over. Significantly, after years of low inflation, we are now talking about the opposite scenario for the US. Eek. The futures market is now indicating that the Dow Jones industrial average will fall further when trading resumes, in under four hours. It\u2019s still early days (many New York traders will still be asleep), but a sign that Wall Street is somewhat feverish after the biggest daily fall since 2011. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, warns that there could be more turmoil ahead: Stock markets are still squarely in the red this morning even though we are seeing a recovery. After another horrendous session in New York last night and Asia overnight equity markets in Europe are feeling the pain. The sheers size of the sell-offs has sent traders running for the exit. This morning there is some short covering and bargain going on, but the real acid test will be if this short-term move higher can be sustained. Markets don\u2019t move in straight lines so this could be the calm before the next storm. A top central banker has called on international authorities to rein in bitcoin. Agusti\u0301n Carstens, the new head of the Bank for International Settlements, warned this morning that bitcoin had become a combination of \u201ca bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster\u201d. More here: Time for a quick recap. European stock markets have suffered sharp losses this morning after Wall Street was routed last night. But markets are clawing their way back from their worst levels, as investors cross their fingers and hope that we\u2019re experiencing a correction, not a full-blown crash. After two hours trading, the FTSE 100 is down 146 points - or 2% - at 7189. It had earlier hit a one-year low, by shedding 255 points at the open. The Footsie has now fallen by around 6.3% this year, and shed all 2017\u2019s gains. Across Europe, traders have been selling hard - after the shock of seeing the Dow Jones industrial average tumble by 1,175 points on Monday, its biggest points fall ever (but a more modest percentage decline of 4.6%). The benchmark Stoxx 600 is down 1.6%, with heavier losses in Germany (-1.9%). European markets had initially plunged by 3%, their biggest fall since the Brexit vote, after a day of heavy losses in Asia. But shares are rebounding off their worst levels, thanks to indications that Wall Street may open higher. Several analysts are suggesting that today\u2019s falls are a correction, following frothy rises during 2017. Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index, says: Whilst there was no single event which prompted Monday\u2019s sell off, fears over rising interest rates dampening economic growth and the fact that the market is long due a correction, have been weighing on sentiment. The first signs falling confidence and investors have been surprisingly quick to sell out and book profits from the phenomenal rally over the past few months. Asian investors have already suffered a bad day, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei sliding into correction territory (10% below its peak), the Hong Kong Hang Seng down 5%, China\u2019s main markets down around 3%, and India\u2019s Sensex down 1.5%. Today\u2019s sell-off is a great chance to buy stocks, says Michael Strobaek, Global CIO at Credit Suisse. Strobaek is telling his clients that this week\u2019s sell-off is not a crash, and actually an opportunity to snap up shares. Here\u2019s his reasoning: \u201cWe still consider the equity bull market to be intact and to have the potential to go further. Yet, as we have said on numerous occasions, the bull market is not going to be as good as what we saw in 2017, and it will be associated with high levels of volatility, as short rates and now yields have left their bottoms and are moving higher.\u2019\u2019 Recent risk-off moves in equities do not shake our equities conviction. We see the latest developments as a healthy correction that offers a buying opportunity for clients who wish to deploy cash.\u201d Just 12 days ago, US president Donald Trump was bragging to the World Economic Forum that the markets were up 50% on his watch (a slight exaggeration). He even claimed that they\u2019d actually have fallen 50% if the Democrats had won the 2016 election, as he banged the drum for his tax cuts. However, Trump\u2019s trip to Davos may mark the top of the rally. As this charts shows, the Dow has fallen by around 8% since his trip to the ski resort: Disappointingly, Trump hasn\u2019t commented about the markets recently. The FT has called him out for this today, pointing out that he tweeted 60 times during the Dow\u2019s surge of record highs in 2017. The boss of oil giant BP, Bob Dudley, is relieved that the FTSE is only at a one-year low. Breaking away from the markets briefly. Over at Parliament,former Carillion executives are being grilled over the collapse of the outsourcing company last month. It\u2019s being streamed live here. My colleague Rob Davies is watching. He reports that Carillion\u2019s ex-boss is blaming certain clients for its demise, but MPs aren\u2019t impressed.... Paul McNamara, investment director at asset management firm GAM, reports that it\u2019s a rough morning - especially for any trader trying to persuade clients to bet that the markets will be calm: Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, says the recent phase of unnatural calm in the markets is definitely over. \u201cThe low volatility regime is likely dead \u2013 2017 and early 2018 were a crazy anomaly. So far the blow up is scary but has been relatively contained. This is the largest two-day selloff since the flash crash of August 2015. A 12% top-to-bottom move in S&amp;P 500 futures is likely the product of a chain reaction that started last Friday when unexpectedly strong US wage growth figures pushed US rates higher. S&amp;P 500 futures are now up 2.6% from their lows.\u201d But Jacob Deppe, head of trading at online trading platform, Infinox, argues that the sell off is actually healthy: \u201cWhile the fall in global equity markets looks dramatic, it is no more dramatic than the record rises we have seen since the end of November. For that reason alone many would argue a correction was on the cards. \u201cThe party may be over for now but this could be more of a sobering correction than a rout. \u201cThere have been plenty of warnings over the past few weeks that equities were overvalued and that US stock markets in particular were overheating. The Dow Jones industrial average is now predicted to rise by 137 points later today. That would barely make an impact on Mondays 1,175-point rout, but could calm fears that a crash is brewing.... There\u2019s a glimmer of good news -- the futures market is suggesting that the US stock market may open higher after yesterday\u2019s rout. The S&amp;P Futures contract is currently up around 0.8%, indicating that American shares will claw back some of Monday\u2019s slump (when the S&amp;P 500 shed 4.1%). Wall Street doesn\u2019t open for five hours, though, so the situation could change. After one hour\u2019s trading, European stock markets are a sea of red - although they\u2019re coming back from their worst levels. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, points out that Britain\u2019s stock market has underperformed Wall Street over the last year - even before today\u2019s rout. He writes: The recent falls in the Dow Jones has left the index down 1.5% in the year to date \u2013 but over the last year, the index remains in positive territory to the tune of 21%. In terms of the UK, rather more apples have fallen as the tree has been shaken. Over the last year the index is completely flat, whilst in the year to date it has fallen 6.4%. The previous benefit of weaker sterling has evaporated, and whilst participation in the previous rally was somewhat half-hearted, the same cannot be said of the UK market\u2019s reaction to the current jitters. Gemma Godfrey, founder of investment site Moola, also blames last week\u2019s strong US jobs data for sparking a bloodbath in stocks. This is one of the roughest mornings for the markets in 18 months: The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more medium-sized UK firms, is also suffering big losses today. The FTSE 250 is down over 2%, with almost every member falling. Transport firm Stagecoach is the biggest faller, down almost 9% after losing its franchise to run Britain\u2019s East Coast rail franchise. Online grocer Ocado has shed 7% after missing its profit expectations this morning. It\u2019s worth remembering that the stock markets posted some astonishing gains last year, with global stocks gaining 22% and Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 up 7.6%.. Economics journalist Dharshini David says the markets are now coming back to earth: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the sell-off is being driven by a \u2018perfect storm\u2019. They include: A strong 2017 rally extending into January, low volatility, low interest rates, over-optimism and complacency, over-leverage and financial engineering, all coming to a head as investors react to the possibility of higher/faster interest rates rises with bond yields creeping higher to jeopardise the current market situation. It\u2019s always hard to explain exactly why the financial markets are behaving in a certain way. But many City experts are attributing the sell-off to fears that central banks will soon raise interest rates, ending the era of cheap money. Last Friday, we learned that American workers have enjoyed the biggest jump in earnings since 2009. That\u2019s great news - except it could force the US central bank to hike borrowing costs more aggressively. Investors are now factoring in four American interest rate hikes this year - up from three before. It\u2019s also worth noting that markets surged in 2017, thanks to optimism over the global economy. Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts gave shares another lift -- because cutting corporation tax is good for profits. But.. those same tax cuts could force America to borrow more money to cover its budget deficit. That would probably push down the value of US government debt, and push up the interest rate (or yield) on those bonds. Again, that could force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. It could also make bonds a more attractive investment - another reason to ditch shares today.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: European stocks have fallen to their lowest level since last August, as traders hit the sell button at bourses across the continent. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe\u2019s biggest companies, has fallen by 3.1% this morning. Germany is having a particularly bad morning, down over 3.5%. The London stock market is still deep in the red, but might be bouncing off its opening slump. The FTSE 100 has now lost 7% of its value so far this year, despite hitting a record high in January. Here are the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 in early trading: Boom! Britain\u2019s blue-chip index of top shares is tumbling at the start of trading, to its lowest level in a year. The FTSE 100 fell by 255 points, or over 3.2%, to 7079 points, with every share losing ground. It\u2019s not been that low since December 2016. Investors are scrambling to sell shares following the tumbles on Wall Street last night, and Asia earlier today. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group tells us: The stock market open in the UK and Europe looks about as bad as it can get. The bloodbath on Wall Street, which was repeated in Asia has seen confidence evaporate in Europe. Hold onto your hats.... the European stock markets are about to open... Cryptocurrencies are also being hammered hard this morning. Bitcoin has tumbled by 12% this morning, taking the digital currency below $6,000 for the first time this year. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says: The most famous digital currency has fallen 69% from December\u2019s record high, and almost 56% from the start of the year. The slide comes after many banks in the U.S. and U.K. considered banning customers from buying cryptocurrencies using their credit cards. It seems the war against the crypto-world is far from over, and how the situation involves from here remains unknown, but risks are certainly high. If you missed last night\u2019s turmoil (where were you?), here\u2019s a reminder of how the Dow Jones Industrial Average took an almighty bath: Risk aversion is \u201chigh\u201d in the City today as we head towards the start of trading., says Elsa Lignos of RBC Capital Markets. She says RBS\u2019s \u2018risk aversion thermometer\u2019 hit a 2.5 year high of 27 on Monday - the highest level since China stunned the markets by devaluing its currency in 2015. Lignos adds: That time it took six weeks to turn risk-seeking again. Jamie McGeever of Reuters has a sobering fact -- $4 trillion has been wiped off global markets in the last week. That figure could be somewhat higher by the end of the day.... Earlier today Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell into \u2018correction territory\u2019, meaning it has shed more than 10% from its recent high. The sharp losses on global stock markets in recent days may be a sign that the \u2018Goldilocks\u2019 era is over -- replaced by some aggressive and hungry bears. Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities., explains: \u201cSince last autumn, investors had been betting on the goldilocks economy - solid economic expansion, improving corporate earnings and stable inflation. But the tide seems to have changed.\u201d Good morning from London. Financial markets are in turmoil after America\u2019s stocks suffered their biggest one-day slide in six years. The Dow plunged by over 1,100 points on Monday, its worst points loss ever and the biggest one-day percentage decline since the Eurozone crisis of 2011. This has sent shockwaves through the markets, as investors fear that the long bull market in shares and bonds may be ending. Worries over rising inflation and the prospect of American interest rate rises sparked Monday\u2019s sell off. Some traders warning that computer trading strategies has triggered a flash crash (at one stage the Dow was down by a vertiginous 1,500 points). Already today, Asian markets have posted severe losses. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has shed 4.7%, while Australia\u2019s market shed 3.2%. My colleague Claire Phipps has been live-blogging all the action in Asia\u2019s markets here: European markets open in under an hour, and traders are already expecting heavy losses. City firm IG are calling Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 down around 3%, with the French, German, Italian and Spanish markets also heading for very sharp falls. Jingyi Pan of IG warns that the markets are febrile today: \u201cThere would be few places to hide from the risk-off atmosphere that is expected to extend its stay in Asian markets today in a significant manner. This is fear rolling over itself,\u201d Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says this correction has been a long time coming... These declines have been a long time coming and in a sense have already started to become self-accelerating. At the end of last year margin debt levels on US stocks were at record highs, helping fuel the rise we\u2019ve seen in the last few months. The sell-off in the last few days is likely to reverse this trend, and potentially accelerate it further, particularly if investors start to unwind it over concerns that we could fall further, which seems likely if events in Asia this morning are any guide. It\u2019s a volatile situation out there - traders will be looking to see whether Wall Street can recover, or whether it suffers fresh losses. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action through the day....",

Instead, he highlights several reasons to be worried. For example:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The past couple of days have shown one thing \u2013 that there was an awful lot of money betting on tranquillity via various financial products manufactured by investment banks. Did a wipeout of some of these low-volatility funds feed the selling pressures on Monday? Almost certainly. But is that \u201ctechnical\u201d factor a temporary sideshow that can be ignored? Not necessarily. It may be evidence that other risks have been packaged up and sold as \u201clow risk\u201d when they\u2019re actually the reverse. When investors are fed cheap money for a decade, dumb bets can be made. </p> <p>Plus, the prelude to the drama was a rapid rise in the yield on 10-year US treasuries from 2.4% to 2.8%. This, we are told, happened because the strong news on jobs and wages means the US Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates three times this year. That explanation is entirely plausible. But a 10-year yield of 2.8% is still low by historical standards. What would something more normal \u2013 say, 4% \u2013 do? If the deflation dragon really has been slain and the Trump administration is dishing out tax cuts, isn\u2019t 4% a possibility? On the evidence of the past week, the stock market may not adjust easily.</p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/feb/06/a-stock-market-correction-such-group-think-is-alarming\">Groupthink about Monday\u2019s \u2018correction\u2019 is slightly alarming | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7a02aae4b00694282733b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T19:34:42.370Z\">7.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Wall Street continues to see-saw, and with 90 minutes trading left the main indices are in the red.</strong></p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 has shed 0.5% (on top of Monday\u2019s 4.1% fall), while the Dow remains pretty volatile - currently down 0.2%.</p> <p>Investors continue to blame the prospect of rising US interest rates, and signs that wages are finally picking up.</p> <p>As Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, puts it (via the FT):<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I still think this is a continued reaction to the very rapid rise in interest rates and inflation expectations over a short period of time.</p> <p>We are just seeing some continued selling after a very long period of a complacent environment.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a79ff93e4b07d68a97f631d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T19:24:26.321Z\">7.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">How the market turmoil hit the world's wealthiest</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Some of the world\u2019s richest people are a little less rich today, thanks to yesterday\u2019s market mayhem.</strong></p> <p>Bloomberg has calculated that Warren Buffett, the veteran investor, lost $5.1bn on Monday.

The Dow is at 24,423 (now up on the day) trading at a level that was last seen just two months ago. </p> <p> This sell off has been a technical phenomenon, there has not been a change in fundamentals.

Its chief global economist Andrew Kenningham said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The slump in equity markets would have to go a lot further to cause economic growth to slow significantly. That may yet happen, but for now prospects for global growth still look fairly bright. </p> <p>The fall in global equity prices over the past few days has been unusually sudden, but it is not yet exceptionally large. The MSCI World equity index has fallen by 6% from its peak last week. As a comparison, there have been four instances of double-digit percentage falls in the index since the financial crisis. These occurred in 2010 (-15%), 2011 (-20%), 2012 (-13%) and 2015/16 (-17%). </p> <p>It is of course quite possible that equities will fall much further in the coming days or weeks, or even hours! After all, valuations are high by past standards and the MSCI World index is still 17% above its level a year ago. But even if this happens, the fallout for the economy may still be quite small.</p> <p>... Stock markets often send a false signal about the outlook for economic growth. And there has been only a small increase in corporate bond yields, which have a better track record in signalling slowdowns. The most reliable leading indicators of economic activity, such as the global PMIs and the US ISM non-manufacturing index published yesterday, suggest that the world economy is firing on all cylinders. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a79d9cfe4b0faf969c78881\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T16:43:06.899Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 suffers biggest one day fall since Brexit vote</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 has dropped by 2.64% or 193 points to its lowest level since last April.</p> <p>This is the biggest percentage drop since the day after the UK referendum on Europe, and marks the sixth successive trading day of declines.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a79d6dae4b07d68a97f6126\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T16:27:23.440Z\">4.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Dow\u2019s uncertainty continues, and it is now down 141 points.

While Donald Trump\u2019s White House has correctly pointed to strong economic fundamentals as a more important long term story and the role of the tax cuts in driving this, they\u2019ve failed to appreciate the impact that their policies could have on inflation, and therefore the path of interest rates.</p> </blockquote> <p>Royal London\u2019s head of multi asset Trevor Greetham added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors welcomed the announcements of tax cuts but are starting to get second thoughts as the consequences of adding stimulus late in the business cycle become clear. Unemployment is low and the potential for strong wage inflation once US tax cuts take effect has spooked markets, given what this means for US interest rate policy.</p> <p>Although rising interest rates pose a challenge to the stock market, this will only become a serious one once they are high enough to cause the economy to roll over. With the Fed Funds rate still below the level of core inflation in the US, that could take quite a while.</p> <p>We expect bouts of volatility like this to become more common now the Federal Reserve is in play, but expect stocks to recover over the coming weeks and months, making recent market moves look like an overreaction.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a79c22de4b0aff22b7e49c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T14:59:53.246Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The early recovery in US markets gives some credence to those who believe the recent falls were a much needed market correction rather than the precursor to a wider sell-off.

If the selloff continues, surely Powell\u2019s Federal Reserve will wind back the tightening of monetary policy (the equivalent of pouring a bit more gin into the punch bowl).</p> <p>Larry argues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump has a lot riding on the stock market continuing to rise and certainly did not choose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/02/jay-powell-federal-reserve-janet-yellen\">Jerome Powell</a> to be the chairman of the Fed because he thought his appointee was an interest-rate hawk.</p> <p>The falls on Wall Street were triggered by last week\u2019s labour market report, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-job-numbers-and-wage-growth-are-up-but-inequality-is-also-on-the-rise\">showed unemployment at 4.1% and a pick-up in average hourly earnings</a>. But Powell would not have to look all that hard to find reasons for a gradual, market-pleasing, rise in interest rates rather than an aggressive tightening. If the current turmoil continues, Powell will no doubt seek to reassure the markets.</p> <p>If this all sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it is.

That\u2019s great news - except it could force the US central bank to hike borrowing costs more aggressively. Investors are now factoring in four American interest rate hikes this year - up from three before.</p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that markets surged in 2017, thanks to optimism over the global economy. Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts gave shares another lift -- because cutting corporation tax is good for profits.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-spending-debt-analysis-20180203-story.html\">But.. those same tax cuts could force America to borrow more money to cover its budget deficit</a>. That would probably push down the value of US government debt, and push up the interest rate (or yield) on those bonds. Again, that could force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. </p> <p>It could also make bonds a more attractive investment - another reason to ditch shares today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/05/why-are-global-stock-markets-falling\">Why are global stock markets falling?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T08:31:22.252Z\">at 8.31am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a796633e4b081f9d0100415\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T08:27:45.588Z\">8.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sign up to our email</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Guardian Business offers a daily email covering markets, the economy, companies news, property and much more.</p> <p>Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day.</p> <p>For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7964e8e4b0c56a1f8b7546\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-06T08:23:33.657Z\">8.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European stocks hit hard</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>European stocks have fallen to their lowest level since last August, as traders hit the sell button at bourses across the continent.</strong></p> <p>The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe\u2019s biggest companies, has fallen by 3.1% this morning.

      "bodyText": "Shares in London plunged for a sixth day and by the largest amount since the Brexit vote as concerns grew that febrile global stock markets, which have lost $4tn (\u00a32.9tn) in value since Friday, were in the grip of panic-selling. The FTSE 100 slumped 2.6% to 7,141 to wipe out all the gains from this year\u2019s trading and set the index of Britain\u2019s most valuable companies on course for a second week of losses. Investors took fright elsewhere in Europe, with markets in Germany, France and Spain all closing down by more than 2%. Stocks also tumbled across Asia earlier in the day. The Tokyo Nikkei 225 index was among the worst affected after shares fell by more than 4% to 21,620, leaving them 12% down on last month\u2019s peak of 24,120. In New York high-volume trading led to a volatile day. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day closing up 567 points, or 2.3%, at 24,912. At its lowest point, the index was down 567 points. After two huge sell-offs in succession the result restored a measure of calm. The US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said he was not \u201coverly concerned about the market volatility. I think the fundamentals are quite strong.\u201d The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, also dismissed concerns that the performance reflected any weakness in the US economic picture. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that\u2019s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that\u2019s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago and we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are right now,\u201d Sanders said. The losses in Europe and Asia followed concerns that central banks will increase interest rates this year by more than expected in response to inflationary pressures from surging global economies. In her last meeting as chair of the Federal Reserve last week, Janet Yellen hinted that stronger than expected inflation could prompt the central bank to review its policy of three rate increases this year. Fed rate-setter Robert Kaplan on Monday repeated the message that three hikes may not be enough to keep inflation in check. Analysts said figures on Friday from the US showing a strong recovery in average weekly earnings, which many believe could feed through into rising prices, were another trigger for Monday\u2019s panic-selling in New York. The Dow dropped 1,175 points, the largest one-day points fall on record. In percentage terms, at 4.6%, it was the biggest decline in a day since 2011. Jasper Lawler, the head of research at online trading firm London Capital Group, said the Wall Street sell-off on Monday that was repeated in Asia had \u201cseen confidence evaporate in Europe\u201d. Brent Schutte, the chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, said the plunge was not caused by inflation fears alone. The markets had been unusually calm since late 2016, he said, and investors were betting that would continue. \u201cPeople were positioned for more central bank easing or continued central bank easing, low rates and, importantly, low volatility,\u201d he said. \u201cCorrections are caused by people having to reposition for new environments.\u201d The Vix index, which measures the volatility of global markets, suffered its highest one-day spike on record on Monday. Last November Kaplan said stock markets were in danger of being in a bubble that could burst after the value of a broader measure of stocks in New York, the S&amp;P 500 index, hit 135% of US GDP, the highest since the dotcom bubble burst in 1999-2000. Mnuchin sought to calm fears of fresh falls in stock prices on Tuesday. He said in testimony to Congress that markets were functioning very well and the current market sell-off was just a correction. He said market fundamentals were strong and algorithmic trading was in part to blame for the sudden drop on Monday. There were no financial stability implications in the recent market moves, he added, although the administration was monitoring the situation. The Dow is still up 20% over the last year while the S&amp;P 500 was 15% higher. But there was contagion to other markets, with metal prices dropping by more than 2% and the oil price lower for the fourth day. \u201cWe read this as a stock-driven sell-off,\u201d ING metals analyst Oliver Nugent said. \u201cIt\u2019s market contagion. There\u2019s nothing really happening on the fundamentals front.\u201d Paul Donovan, chief global economist at UBS, said the stock market fall was likely to be choked off while the global economy remained strong. He said that while inflation could rise by more than expected this year, it was likely to remain muted. \u201cThis is not a fundamentals-driven sell-off. It is a technical sell-off that is exaggerated by fund managers trading in volatility.\u201d He said all the major industrialised nations grew together last year as the recovery in the eurozone, coupled with a resurgent Japan, took hold. \u201cThis has happened only seven times in the last 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while this has been a long recovery that inevitably prompts people to ask when is the next recession coming, it has been a mild recovery and it remains on course to continue this year.\u201d",

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u2013 which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u2013 coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The losses in Europe and Asia followed concerns that central banks will increase interest rates this year by more than expected in response to inflationary pressures from surging global economies.</p> \n<p>In her last meeting as chair of the Federal Reserve last week, Janet Yellen hinted that stronger than expected inflation could prompt the central bank to review its policy of three rate increases this year.

      "bodyText": "A storm in a teacup? A healthy correction? Have investors, or at least those fooled by two years of unnatural calm in stock markets, merely been handed an overdue lesson that share prices can fall suddenly as well as rise smoothly? Will we be sleeping soundly again by the end of the week? The not-much-to-worry-about school has history on its side. Most stock market wobbles do not develop into something worse. There have been only three serious stock market plunges in the last 30 years or so (1987, the 2000-01 bursting of the dotcom bubble and the banking crash of 2008) but many more corrections along the way that appear as minor deviations on today\u2019s charts. In the same spirit, Monday\u2019s 1,175-point slide in the Dow Jones industrial average made for exciting viewing but, in truth, the numbers did not light up the dial. Even a sudden 4.6% drop does not count as proper drama in the context of a US stock market that has risen (still) by about 50% since early 2016. And, remember, the economic backdrop in the US is falling unemployment and rising wages, which is good news. Nevertheless, there are alarming features to the market action. The first is the uniformity of opinion that normal service will resume soon. The pundits, analysts and fund managers rolled out by US financial TV channels on Monday night all said the same thing: it\u2019s a correction, a reset, an adjustment. They\u2019re probably right but, perversely, it would be more encouraging if there were a range of views: groupthink is not reassuring. Second, the past couple of days have shown one thing \u2013 that there was an awful lot of money betting on tranquillity via various financial products manufactured by investment banks. Did a wipeout of some of these low-volatility funds feed the selling pressures on Monday? Almost certainly. But is that \u201ctechnical\u201d factor a temporary sideshow that can be ignored? Not necessarily. It may be evidence that other risks have been packaged up and sold as \u201clow risk\u201d when they\u2019re actually the reverse. When investors are fed cheap money for a decade, dumb bets can be made. Third, the prelude to the drama was a rapid rise in the yield on 10-year US treasuries from 2.4% to 2.8%. This, we are told, happened because the strong news on jobs and wages means the US Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates three times this year. That explanation is entirely plausible. But a 10-year yield of 2.8% is still low by historical standards. What would something more normal \u2013 say, 4% \u2013 do? If the deflation dragon really has been slain and the Trump administration is dishing out tax cuts, isn\u2019t 4% a possibility? On the evidence of the past week, the stock market may not adjust easily. To repeat: the correction thesis is probably correct and the consensus view that calm will return is perfectly sensible. But the seemingly rock-solid certainty behind the idea is unsettling. After a bull market in shares that has lasted nine years, you\u2019d expect to hear more scepticism. Carillion was no place for blind optimism \u201cClearly with the benefit of hindsight, should the board have been asking further, more probing questions, perhaps?\u201d said Keith Cochrane, the former non-executive director of Carillion who was handed the (PFI) hospital pass and became stand-in chief executive after the huge profits warning in July 2017. What do you mean \u201cperhaps\u201d? Is there any doubt about it? Cochrane\u2019s qualification was probably unintended since he clearly believes the board should have done more. But it was typical of the exchanges between MPs and the failed directors. Board members pleaded that their judgments were fair at the time and made on the basis of the facts as they appeared. Blind optimism would be a better description of their approach.

      "body": "<p>A storm in a teacup? A healthy correction? Have investors, or at least those fooled by two years of unnatural calm in stock markets, merely been handed an overdue lesson that share prices can fall suddenly as well as rise smoothly? Will we be sleeping soundly again by the end of the week?</p> <p>The not-much-to-worry-about school has history on its side. Most stock market wobbles do not develop into something worse. There have been only three serious stock market plunges in the last 30 years or so (1987, the 2000-01 bursting of the dotcom bubble and the banking crash of 2008) but many more corrections along the way that appear as minor deviations on today\u2019s charts.</p> <p>In the same spirit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/05/stock-markets-continue-to-fall-amid-interest-rate-hike-fears\">Monday\u2019s 1,175-point slide in the Dow Jones industrial average</a> made for exciting viewing but, in truth, the numbers did not light up the dial. Even a sudden 4.6% drop does not count as proper drama in the context of a US stock market that has risen (still) by about 50% since early 2016. And, remember, the economic backdrop in the US is falling unemployment and rising wages, which is good news.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2018-02-06T18:21:13/embed.html\" data-alt=\"graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2018-02-06T18:21:13/embed.html\">graph</a> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, there are alarming features to the market action. The first is the uniformity of opinion that normal service will resume soon. The pundits, analysts and fund managers rolled out by US financial TV channels on Monday night all said the same thing: it\u2019s a correction, a reset, an adjustment. They\u2019re probably right but, perversely, it would be more encouraging if there were a range of views: groupthink is not reassuring.</p> <p>Second, the past couple of days have shown one thing \u2013 that there was an awful lot of money betting on tranquillity via various financial products manufactured by investment banks. Did a wipeout of some of these low-volatility funds feed the selling pressures on Monday? Almost certainly. But is that \u201ctechnical\u201d factor a temporary sideshow that can be ignored? Not necessarily. It may be evidence that other risks have been packaged up and sold as \u201clow risk\u201d when they\u2019re actually the reverse. When investors are fed cheap money for a decade, dumb bets can be made.</p> <p>Third, the prelude to the drama was a rapid rise in the yield on 10-year US treasuries from 2.4% to 2.8%. This, we are told, happened because the strong news on jobs and wages means the US Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates three times this year. That explanation is entirely plausible. But a 10-year yield of 2.8% is still low by historical standards. What would something more normal \u2013 say, 4% \u2013 do? If the deflation dragon really has been slain and the Trump administration is dishing out tax cuts, isn\u2019t 4% a possibility? On the evidence of the past week, the stock market may not adjust easily.</p> <p>To repeat: the correction thesis is probably correct and the consensus view that calm will return is perfectly sensible. But the seemingly rock-solid certainty behind the idea is unsettling. After a bull market in shares that has lasted nine years, you\u2019d expect to hear more scepticism.</p> <h2>Carillion was no place for blind optimism</h2> <p>\u201cClearly with the benefit of hindsight, should the board have been asking further, more probing questions, perhaps?\u201d said Keith Cochrane, the former non-executive director of Carillion who was handed the (PFI) hospital pass and became stand-in chief executive after the huge profits warning in July 2017. What do you mean \u201cperhaps\u201d? Is there any doubt about it?</p> <p>Cochrane\u2019s qualification was probably unintended since he clearly believes the board should have done more. But it was typical of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/carillion-director-mp-executives-collapse\">the exchanges between MPs and the failed directors</a>. Board members pleaded that their judgments were fair at the time and made on the basis of the facts as they appeared. Blind optimism would be a better description of their approach.</p> <p>Carillion was the second biggest beast in a UK construction industry where failures are hardly unknown, profit margins have always been thin and cost overruns happen often.

It is inexplicable, on the face of it, that an optimistic US jobs report on Friday would trigger a strong negative reaction. But in her final interview after four years as Fed chair, Janet Yellen noted that stock market valuations were high \u2013 even though she could not say if they represented a bubble. But there are also other factors at play: 1 Rising wages Over the past four years, the US economy has added 10 million jobs, bringing the overall unemployment rate to its lowest level since 2000. Now wages are beginning to rise: more than half of US states have recorded growth of 3% or more. In his State of the Union address last week, Trump said Americans were \u201cfinally seeing rising wages\u201d after \u201cyears and years\u201d of stagnation. Sensing new inflationary pressure, investors became spooked. 2 Interest rates Rates have been kept low for two decades, flushing economies with liquidity and causing bubbles to inflate, pop and form again. There\u2019s nothing economists like more than bubble-hunting, and nothing pops bubbles faster that interest rates rises. The Fed has signaled three rate increases this year, and maybe a fourth \u2013 posing a continuing risk to the years-long rally in stocks. 3 Government deficit The yearly US deficit could hit $1tn in 2018, and that\u2019s before Trump\u2019s radical tax-cutting agenda is felt. According to the joint committee on taxation, government revenues will drop by $135bn this year, will be down $280bn in 2019. But spending is set to increase, including billions on disaster aid for California wildfires and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Trump says he is not worried: he believes the repatriation of corporate profits will help correct the imbalance. 4 Profit taking It is puzzling to analysts that the money coming out of the markets is not necessarily going into government treasuries or other safe havens. That suggests investors are also simply taking out profit after an intense market rally at the beginning of this year. Despite recording its biggest-ever one-day points drop on Monday, the Dow was less than 5% off its record highs in late January. That suggests there is still money on the table. \u201cWhile the fall in global equity markets looks dramatic, it is no more dramatic than the record rises we have seen since the end of November,\u201d said Jacob Deppe of the online trading platform Infinox. 5 The machines The excitable traders of previous eras have been largely replaced by computers running complex mathematical algorithms. Just after 3pm on Monday the Dow recorded a 900-point drop in 10 minutes, a pace of sell orders that took the index from 700 down to 1,600 points down.

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u2013 which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u2013 coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>2 Interest rates</h2> \n<p>Rates have been kept low for two decades, flushing economies with liquidity and causing bubbles to inflate, pop and form again.

      "bodyText": "The troubled fashion retailer New Look has confirmed store closures could be on the cards as the new management team battles to arrest falling sales. The New Look executive chairman, Alistair McGeorge, said the private equity-backed retailer was weighing up a restructuring process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which is used by struggling retailers to close loss-making stores or agree rent reductions with landlords. \u201cA CVA is one of the options we are looking at,\u201d said McGeorge, who said he had also identified \u00a325m of cost-savings at the business since he returned to the helm in November after a four-year absence. New Look has 594 UK stores with about 60, or 10% of the total, thought to be at risk of closure. McGeorge was parachuted in to lead the retailer, where sales and profits have collapsed, after the previous management team led by Anders Kristiansen pushed up prices and started selling clothes that were \u201ctoo young and edgy \u2026 We were selling clothes at the wrong price aimed at the wrong people.\u201d Sales for the 39 weeks to 23 December dropped 6.3% to \u00a31.1bn, resulting in a pre-tax loss of \u00a3123.5m. In the UK like-for-like sales fell 10.7% over the same period. Last month it emerged that some of New Look\u2019s suppliers had had their cover pulled by the insurer Euler Hermes after it took a dim view of the chain\u2019s precarious finances. Credit insurance protects suppliers during the period between an order being accepted and payment. New Look was acquired by the South African private equity firm Brait for \u00a3780m in 2015. The retailer is saddled with a \u00a31.2bn debt mountain, but the company said it was not seeking to restructure its loans. McGeorge rejoined New Look following the abrupt departure of Kristiansen in September, while Tom Singh, who founded the chain, has also returned to a hands-on role.",

      "bodyText": "It turns out we\u2019ve all been asking the wrong question. There\u2019s no great secret to why Carillion went bust. The only real mystery is what took the company so long when so many were hell-bent on running it into the ground. First up in a marathon four-hour session before a joint meeting of the business and work and pensions select committees were the former interim chief executive, Keith Cochrane, who had been appointed after the profits warning in July last year, and the sacked finance officer, Zafar Khan. Neither of whom any sensible person would leave in charge of a tombola stall at a village fete, let alone one of the largest construction and services companies in the UK. Cochrane was baffled. Before being promoted to chief executive, he had been a non-executive director of the company and appeared totally at a loss as to what had gone wrong. Yes, things had seemed a bit iffy at times, he admitted, but he had done his bit by raising a few concerns now and again. So, did he think he might have challenged the board rather more robustly, inquired the joint chair Frank Field. Oh, no. That wasn\u2019t the way these things worked at all. The whole point of a non-exec was to rock the boat as little as possible. That\u2019s what he had got paid \u00a360k for. Doing next to nothing. No one at his level gets out of bed for that sort of money. \u201cThe business got itself into this position,\u201d Cochrane continued. In his world, Carillion was a corporate superhero with cosmic powers of self determination. It had never once occurred to him that anything he or any of the other people in charge might have contributed to the company\u2019s downfall. Khan is an accountant who genuinely can\u2019t count. \u201cThe company\u2019s debt went down on my watch,\u201d he said confidently. Er, no it didn\u2019t, interrupted the co-chair, Rachel Reeves, who had the foresight to hold the balance sheet the right way up. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d Khan continued seamlessly. \u201cThe debt did go up.\u201d The reason for the confusion soon became clear. Khan didn\u2019t actually understand the meaning of the word debt. Or anything very much. Field wondered if the consistently high level of debt shouldn\u2019t have bothered the board, as it may have been a prime contributor to Carillion\u2019s weaknesses. \u201cWhat weaknesses?\u201d Khan asked. At this point, the committee had to break it to him that the company had been forced into liquidation last month. Khan appeared astonished to learn this. When he had last looked, the company had been in tip-top shape. Give or take a few hundred million. The litany of incompetence went on and on. No, it had never occurred to either Cochrane or Khan that not getting paid on a contract for 18 months might generate cash flow problems. And it had seemed perfectly normal to prioritise shareholder dividends over pension deficits after issuing profit warnings. Dimness taken to new levels. Things didn\u2019t improve much when the former chief exec Richard Howson, chief finance officer, Richard Adam, chairman, Philip Green, and chair of remuneration committee, Alison Horner, gave evidence. They too, though naturally devastated for all the little people who had lost both money and jobs, were completely bewildered that Carillion had gone belly up. They all sought to shift the blame elsewhere and were adamant they would have given their lives for the company. Though not their cash. Reeves asked Horner if she felt OK about having recommended massive pay rises and bonuses for members of the board when the company apparently resembled a giant Ponzi scheme, taking on unprofitable new contracts to pay for failing ones, for so long. \u201cSo \u2026\u201d said Horner. She began every sentence with a so. So, it was like this. So, no one got a job on an executive remuneration committee by recommending bosses took pay cuts. So, it took people of unusual abilities to run a business so badly and they needed to be rewarded appropriately. So, yes she had been happy to sign off on anything that was put in front of her. Field and Reeves closed in for the kill in a pincer movement. Did any of the Carillion bosses feel even the tiniest bit guilty about having raked in millions between them over the past few years? Talk to the hand. Would they consider repaying some of their bonuses as a gesture of remorse? Talk to the hand again. Nobody understood their pain. How they had suffered. \u201cIs there any last thing you would like to say to those who have lost their jobs while you are all right?\u201d Field asked. There wasn\u2019t. True to form, they just wanted to take the money and run.",

The online grocer revealed it had made a small loss of \u00a3500,000 on sales of \u00a31.3bn in the year to 3 December 2017. The Ocado chief executive, Tim Steiner, also warned that plans to step up investment in 2018 would dent profits in the new financial year. Ocado\u2019s shares tumbled as much as 12% in morning trading before recovering to close down just over 3% at 476.5p. Steiner said Ocado had not had to beg investors for the fresh funds, as they were eager for the company to cash in on the clamour from international retailers to buy its technology services, which are being marketed under its new Ocado Solutions banner. \u201cWe are investing for future profit at the expense of current profits,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the momentum of new signings builds we need the financial flexibility to take advantage of our opportunities.\u201d After several years hawking its wares around the globe, Ocado signed its first international partnership deals with Groupe Casino of France and Canada\u2019s Sobeys last month. Steiner said it was now in \u201cactive discussions with multiple retailers in a variety of geographies\u201d and the prospect of landing more deals meant it was keen to hone the latest technology being installed at its newest distribution centres in Andover, Hampshire, and Erith, Kent. Ocado has earmarked expenditure of \u00a3210m for the coming year as it hires software engineers and developers to iron out glitches. \u201cWe want to improve its resilience,\u201d said Steiner. \u201cRather than just fix things we are asking: why did it break?\u201d A Shore Capital analyst, Clive Black, said the disappointing update was a veiled profit warning from a company that only made its first full-year profit in its 15-year history in 2015. \u201cOcado has issued a poor outcome for 2017, returning to loss-making,\u201d said Black. \u201cIt looks like the group has issued a profit warning to our minds. The [share] placing reflects the magnitude of cash burn for its Nasa-like projects: high in technological detail but one just never sees their benefit from planet Earth.\u201d Ocado\u2019s investment plans come at a time when its existing UK delivery business is under pressure from rising labour costs and food price inflation that is hitting Britons\u2019 spending power. A shortage of drivers in the south-east meant it was forced to increase pay last year, which pushed up annual distribution and administrative costs by 15.7%. Steiner said he regretted his attendance at last month\u2019s Presidents Club men-only fundraising gala where specially hired hostesses were groped and harassed, according to a Financial Times report. \u201cI attended the dinner in a personal capacity as it was a charity event,\u201d he said. \u201cI was shocked by what I read.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland misled parliament over the extent of its mistreatment of struggling business customers, the shadow Treasury minister has claimed. Labour\u2019s Clive Lewis told the Commons on Tuesday he has seen an un-redacted copy of the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s (FCA) investigation into practices at the bank\u2019s restructuring unit, which states the lender\u2019s behaviour was \u201csystemic and widespread\u201d. The shadow Treasury minister added that the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, and its chairman, Sir Howard Davies, \u201cmisled the Treasury select committee in their evidence and [the bank] had a stated policy of misleading members of this house\u201d. The MP has now handed the document over to the chair of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan. Lewis\u2019s comments follow McEwan\u2019s and Davies\u2019 grilling last week at the hands of the Treasury committee, which is investigating allegations that the bank\u2019s Global Restructuring Group [GRG] unit intentionally pushed some struggling businesses towards failure to pick up their assets on the cheap. During that hearing the RBS chairman admitted the report contained instances \u201cof which nightmares are made\u201d. However, the two directors argued that the worst examples of behaviour within GRG were not \u201cwidespread\u201d. Lewis told MPs: \u201cFar from being isolated incidents of poor governance as they claimed to the committee, this report explicitly states their behaviour was \u2018systemic and widespread\u2019. In one shocking passage ... the bank boasted one family business was set to \u2018lose their shirts\u2019 so RBS could get a \u2018chunky equity deal\u2019. \u201cFurthermore, it is clear the summary of the report the FCA has published is, what I would politely describe as, a sanitised version.\u201d The FCA has agreed to publish the full GRG report after RBS said it would not prevent its release. Morgan said: \u201cThe FCA has consented to publish [the] report once it has completed its [enforcement] investigations into conduct at GRG. The committee expects these investigations to be completed swiftly.\u201d RBS said: \u201cThe evidence we provided to the Treasury committee accurately reflected the bank\u2019s position. We are not clear on what basis the allegations are being made, but we would strongly deny the suggestion that we misled the committee.\u201d",

The fashion designer, whose shoes start at \u00a3500 for a classic black court and are a favourite with celebrities such as Kate Winslet, Victoria Beckham and Margot Robbie, has been in court trying to protect the signature red colour of the sole of his shoes \u2013 a look that dates back to 1992, when Louboutin painted a sole red with nail varnish borrowed from an assistant. On Tuesday, the European Court of Justice\u2019s advocate general Maciej Szpunar said the combination of a colour and a shape may be refused trademark protection. The ECJ will now issue a ruling. The French designer went to court in the Netherlands to prevent the Dutch high street shoe chain VanHaren from selling its own red-soled shoes, in a range endorsed by actor Halle Berry.

    "webTitle": "Former Carillion directors branded 'delusional' at MPs' Q&A", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Former directors of Carillion turned down the chance to hand back their bonuses voluntarily, as MPs branded them \u201cdelusional characters\u201d willing to blame everyone but themselves for the government contractor\u2019s failure. Seven former Carillion directors gave evidence to MPs at the start of a joint inquiry by two select committees into the firm\u2019s liquidation earlier this month. The collapse put tens of thousands of jobs and supplier companies at risk, left hundreds of millions of pounds of public contracts unfinished and is set to saddle the government\u2019s pensions lifeboat with an estimated \u00a3800m of liabilities. During two lengthy sessions before MPs from the business select committee and counterparts on the work and pensions committee, former Carillion directors: Denied being \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d of the company Denied prioritising dividends over pension payments Passed up the chance to offer to give bonuses back Blamed Brexit, Qatar, the 2017 general election and each other Admitted failing to question the company\u2019s business model MPs repeatedly accused Carillion directors of prioritising dividend payments over whittling down debts and plugging a pension scheme deficit estimated at \u00a3990m. Keith Cochrane, a former non-executive director who replaced Richard Howson as chief executive after a huge profit warning in July 2017, said: \u201cThrough the lens of today, if we had suspended dividends [...] would that have made a difference, possibly.\u201d But he denied the company put the financial interests of shareholders above those of its 27,000 pension scheme members. Howson said the company at one point raised its dividend \u201cto show confidence in the future\u201d of the business. All of the former directors apologised for their role in Carillion\u2019s demise, saying the company\u2019s debts and pension deficit became unsustainable as conditions deteriorated rapidly in early 2017. They blamed a phalanx of setbacks including non-payment of bills by Qatar, Brexit, the snap election in 2017, interest rates and problems building hospitals in Liverpool and Birmingham. In a joint statement issued after the hearing, committee chairs Frank Field and Rachel Reeves said: \u201cThis morning a series of delusional characters maintained that everything was hunky dory until it all went suddenly and unforeseeably wrong. \u201cWe heard variously that this was the fault of the Bank of England, the foreign exchange markets, advisers, Brexit, the snap election, investors, suppliers, the construction industry, the business culture of the Middle East and professional designers of concrete beams. \u201cEverything we have seen points the fingers in another direction \u2013 to the people who built a giant company on sand in a desperate dash for cash.\u201d The committees also published a recovery plan that Carillion directors drew up in the days before its liquidation, that admitted it had operated with \u201can overly short-term focus, weak operational risk management and too many distractions outside of our \u2018core\u2019\u201d. During the evidence session, former finance director Zafar Khan denied a claim by Reeves that directors were \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d as the company\u2019s debts spiralled to more than \u00a31bn. He added that the company\u2019s ability to secure new contracts \u201cdrifted\u201d due to Brexit and the calling of a general election in 2017. His successor Emma Mercer said Khan and other directors had taken an \u201caggressive tone\u201d in the way they valued contracts that later underperformed. Howson pointed to a \u00a3200m bill owed by Qatar, which remained unpaid for 18 months, for work to redevelop parts of the capital city, Doha, for the 2022 World Cup. Howson said he repeatedly tried to extract payment from Qatar during monthly visits to the country, saying: \u201cI felt like a bailiff.\u201d He also pointed to problems with major contracts including the Royal Liverpool University hospital, where cracked beams led to delays, the Midland Metropolitan hospital and the Aberdeen bypass. The underperforming contracts were among those that starved the debt-laden company of cash and forced it to take an \u00a3845m financial hit six months before its failure. At the end of the session, business committee chair Reeves invited the former directors to pledge to give back their bonuses but none took the opportunity. \u201cAll of you sitting here received multimillion payments from Carillion,\u201d she said. \u201cYou say how sad and disappointed you are but what actions do you take? \u201cIt\u2019s just words. The money\u2019s in the bank. Why don\u2019t you give some money back and try to put right some of this wrong?\u201d Howson, who received cash-plus-shares bonuses worth nearly \u00a31m in 2016, said he would do so if required by the government\u2019s official receiver, adding that the portion paid in shares was already worthless. Earlier, Cochrane said that before he became chief executive, he and other directors could have done more to flag up the growing problems. He said: \u201cClearly with the benefit of hindsight, should the board have been asking further, more probing questions, perhaps.\u201d Asked about the firm\u2019s last-ditch bid for survival in January, Cochrane said directors asked the government for a \u00a3160m cash injection but were refused. \u201cWe believed a longer-term solution was possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat solution would have been the best possible outcome for [the] pension fund, customers, suppliers and employees.\u201d",

in Carillion\u2019s demise, saying the company\u2019s debts and pension deficit became unsustainable as conditions deteriorated rapidly in early 2017.</p> <p>They blamed a phalanx of setbacks including non-payment of bills by Qatar, Brexit, the snap election in 2017, interest rates and problems building <a

statement issued after the hearing, committee chairs Frank Field and Rachel Reeves said: \u201cThis morning a series of delusional characters maintained that everything was hunky dory until it all went suddenly and unforeseeably wrong. </p> <p>\u201cWe heard variously that this was the fault of the Bank of England, the foreign exchange markets, advisers, Brexit, the snap election, investors, suppliers, the construction industry, the business culture of the Middle East and professional designers of concrete beams. </p> <p>\u201cEverything we have seen points the fingers in another direction \u2013 to the people who built a giant company on sand in a desperate dash for cash.\u201d</p> <p>The committees also published a recovery plan that Carillion directors drew up in the days before its liquidation, that admitted it had operated with \u201can overly short-term focus, weak operational risk management and too many distractions outside of our \u2018core\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>During the evidence session, former finance director Zafar Khan denied a claim by Reeves that directors were \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d as the company\u2019s debts spiralled to more than \u00a31bn.</p> <p>He added that the company\u2019s ability to secure new contracts \u201cdrifted\u201d due to Brexit and the calling of a general election in 2017.</p> <p>His successor Emma Mercer said Khan and other directors had taken an \u201caggressive tone\u201d in the way they valued contracts that later underperformed.</p> <p>Howson pointed to a \u00a3200m bill owed by Qatar, which remained unpaid for 18 months, for work to redevelop parts of the capital city, Doha, for the 2022 World Cup.</p> <p>Howson said he repeatedly tried to extract payment from Qatar during monthly visits to the country, saying: \u201cI felt like a bailiff.\u201d</p> <p>He also pointed to problems with major contracts including the Royal Liverpool University hospital, where cracked beams led to delays, the Midland Metropolitan hospital and the Aberdeen bypass.</p> <p>The underperforming contracts were among those that starved the debt-laden company of cash and forced it to take an <a

    "webTitle": "BP aims to invest more in renewables and clean energy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BP has declared it is looking to acquire more green energy firms, as the British oil giant pledged to set carbon targets for its operations. However, while the chief executive, Bob Dudley, said the industry was in a period of major change, he made clear that hydrocarbons would remain the core of BP\u2019s business. \u201cIt\u2019s not a race to renewables, it\u2019s a race to lower greenhouse gas emissions. As fast as renewables and clean energy can grow, faster than any fuel in history, the world is going to require oil and gas for some decades to come,\u201d he said. The company reported on Tuesday that higher oil prices and growing crude production had pushed up profits 139% in 2017 to $6.2bn (\u00a34.5bn) on an underlying replacement cost basis, the company\u2019s preferred measure. Dudley said the firm had enjoyed its most successful year for exploration since 2004. The company said it would start six new oil and gas projects this year, up from five previously, as it outlined a plan to return to growth into the next decade. But much of the company\u2019s strategy update focused on clean energy, which BP said would amount to around $0.5bn of its $15bn-$16bn capital expenditure programme. The carbon targets, including one for methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, will be announced by BP in the next two months. Discussing the shift to green energy, Lamar McKay, the deputy chief executive, said: \u201cOur industry is changing faster than any of us can remember, certainly in my career.\u201d BP recently bought a $200m stake in Europe\u2019s biggest solar developer, returning to solar power six years after it quit the sector, and is reportedly eyeing other bigger solar investments. The oil company is not the only one active in diversifying its business. In the last three months of 2017, its Anglo-Dutch peer, Shell, bought a Dutch car-charging network, partnered with the electric car charging firm Ionity and bought First Utility, one of Britain\u2019s biggest energy suppliers. One of the most eye-catching energy innovations of the last year \u2013 the deployment of the world\u2019s first floating windfarm \u2013 was undertaken not by a renewables developer but Norway\u2019s state-owned oil company, Statoil. Meanwhile, France\u2019s Total took a 23% stake in the renewable energy firm Eren for \u20ac237.5m (\u00a3211m). Big oil has flagged a switch to greener energy before. In the early 2000s, spurred by investor pressure, the international oil companies appeared to be pivoting to move their businesses away from crude. BP memorably tried to reinvent itself in 2000, promising that in the future its initials would stand for Beyond Petroleum, as the chairman, Sir John Browne, told the world: \u201cWe are not an oil company.\u201d Shell also moved heavily into renewables. But not long after the financial crash, Shell stopped investment in wind and solar, and BP shut its alternative energy HQ. Later, around 2016, the oil giants began to take baby steps back into the world of renewables, and take greater notice of the rapid growth of electric cars. Valentina Kretzschmar, the director of research at oil analysts Wood Mackenzie, said although activity had intensified in recent months, it was still small-scale. \u201cIt\u2019s buzzing, but the amount of money spent is still peanuts compared to their core business,\u201d she said. Shell is seen by many industry watchers as the leader in this transition. The chief executive, Ben van Beurden, last week defended the company\u2019s $1bn-$2bn spend on clean energy as modest but \u201cnot a pittance\u201d. \u201cUltimately, the only thing that matters to society is the carbon intensity of energy. How much we invest in aspects of our portfolio is only a secondary concern,\u201d he said, in a message similar to BP\u2019s. Investor pressure, consumer attitudes and governments\u2019 climate change policies are all driving big oil\u2019s transformation. But increasingly it is the economics of renewables and electric cars that are key. \u201cFor many of them, when they started diversifying it was because of investor pressure \u2026 but I think now it\u2019s the market forces that are making them look into diversification,\u201d said Kretzschmar. However, she noted that returns for renewables were still lower than for oil and gas. Irene Rummelhoff, the head of Statoil\u2019s low carbon unit, agreed that returns were lower but were often fixed at a set level, so diversifying made a \u201chuge difference\u201d to cutting risk from volatile oil prices. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the advantages we are seeing in the renewable world; the risk profile is very different,\u201d she said. But the rate of change is slow. Big oil companies own less than 1% of solar and wind capacity globally, according to Wood Mackenzie. Jeremy Leggett, a former petroleum geologist turned solar entrepreneur, said: \u201cAll this is beyond greenwash, but far short of retreat consistent with the Paris [climate] agreement. The oil and gas companies and are essentially taking out hedge bets.\u201d Still, observers think that big oil might really be serious about moving beyond petroleum this time round, for existential reasons. \u201cIt is different this time around,\u201d said Kretzschmar. \u201cThis [the rise of renewables, electric cars and other clean technologies] is for the first time starting to pose a threat to their oil and gas businesses. That wasn\u2019t the case in the early noughties.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>BP has declared it is looking to acquire more green energy firms, as the British oil giant pledged to set carbon targets for its operations.</p> <p>However, while the chief executive, Bob Dudley, said the industry was in a period of major change, he made clear that hydrocarbons would remain the core of BP\u2019s business.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a race to renewables, it\u2019s a race to lower greenhouse gas emissions. As fast as renewables and clean energy can grow, faster than any fuel in history, the world is going to require oil and gas for some decades to come,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The company <a href=\"https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/investors/results-and-reporting/quarterly-results-and-webcast.html\">reported on Tuesday</a> that higher oil prices and growing crude production had pushed up profits 139% in 2017 to $6.2bn (\u00a34.5bn) on an underlying replacement cost basis, the company\u2019s preferred measure. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dudley said the firm had enjoyed its most successful year for exploration since 2004. The company said it would start six new oil and gas projects this year, up from five previously, as it outlined a plan to return to growth into the next decade.<br></p> <p>But much of the company\u2019s strategy update focused on clean energy, which BP said would amount to around $0.5bn of its $15bn-$16bn capital expenditure programme. The carbon targets, including one for methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, will be announced by BP in the next two months.</p> <p>Discussing the shift to green energy, Lamar McKay, the deputy chief executive, said: \u201cOur industry is changing faster than any of us can remember, certainly in my career.\u201d</p> <p>BP recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/15/bp-returns-solar-power-stake-lightsource\">bought a $200m stake</a> in Europe\u2019s biggest solar developer, returning to solar power six years after it quit the sector, and is reportedly eyeing other bigger solar investments. </p> <p>The oil company is not the only one active in diversifying its business. In the last three months of 2017, its Anglo-Dutch peer, Shell, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-newmotion-m-a-shell/shell-buys-newmotion-charging-network-in-first-electric-vehicle-deal-idUKKBN1CH1R5\">bought a Dutch car-charging network</a>, <a href=\"https://www.shell.co.uk/media/2017-media-releases/fastest-electric-vehicle.html\">partnered</a> with the electric car charging firm Ionity and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/21/shell-to-supply-energy-to-uk-households-after-takeover-of-first-utility\">bought First Utility</a>, one of Britain\u2019s biggest energy suppliers.</p> <p>One of the most eye-catching energy innovations of the last year \u2013 the deployment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/27/hywind-project-scotland-worlds-first-floating-windfarm-norway\">the world\u2019s first floating windfarm</a> \u2013 was undertaken not by a renewables developer but Norway\u2019s state-owned oil company, Statoil. Meanwhile, France\u2019s Total <a href=\"https://www.total.com/en/media/news/press-releases/total-partners-eren-renewable-energy-expand-its-renewable-business\">took a 23% stake in the renewable energy firm Eren</a> for \u20ac237.5m (\u00a3211m).</p> <p>Big oil has flagged a switch to greener energy before. In the early 2000s, spurred by investor pressure, the international oil companies appeared to be pivoting to move their businesses away from crude. </p> <p>BP memorably tried to reinvent itself in 2000, promising that in the future <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jul/25/bp\">its initials would stand for Beyond Petroleum</a>, as the chairman, Sir John Browne, told the world: \u201cWe are not an oil company.\u201d Shell also moved heavily into renewables. But not long after the financial crash, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/17/royaldutchshell-energy\">Shell stopped investment in wind and solar</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/28/bp-alternative-energy\">BP shut its alternative energy HQ</a>.</p> <p>Later, around 2016, the oil giants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/21/oil-majors-investments-renewable-energy-solar-wind\">began to take baby steps</a> back into the world of renewables, and take greater notice of the rapid growth of electric cars. </p> <p>Valentina Kretzschmar, the director of research at oil analysts Wood Mackenzie, said although activity had intensified in recent months, it was still small-scale. \u201cIt\u2019s buzzing, but the amount of money spent is still peanuts compared to their core business,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Shell is seen by many industry watchers as the leader in this transition. The chief executive, Ben van Beurden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/01/shell-doubles-profits-but-faces-multibillion-dollar-dutch-quake-bill\">last week defended the company\u2019s $1bn-$2bn spend on clean energy</a> as modest but \u201cnot a pittance\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately, the only thing that matters to society is the carbon intensity of energy. How much we invest in aspects of our portfolio is only a secondary concern,\u201d he said, in a message similar to BP\u2019s.</p> <p>Investor pressure, consumer attitudes and governments\u2019 climate change policies are all driving big oil\u2019s transformation. But increasingly it is the economics of renewables and electric cars that are key.</p> <p>\u201cFor many of them, when they started diversifying it was because of investor pressure \u2026 but I think now it\u2019s the market forces that are making them look into diversification,\u201d said Kretzschmar.</p> <p>However, she noted that returns for renewables were still lower than for oil and gas. Irene Rummelhoff, the head of Statoil\u2019s low carbon unit, agreed that returns were lower but were often fixed at a set level, so diversifying made a \u201chuge difference\u201d to cutting risk from volatile oil prices.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the advantages we are seeing in the renewable world; the risk profile is very different,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But the rate of change is slow. Big oil companies own less than 1% of solar and wind capacity globally, according to Wood Mackenzie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2018-02-06T14:16:53/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Oil companies' clean energy budgets\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2018-02-06T14:16:53/embed.html\">Oil companies' clean energy budgets</a> </figure>  <p>Jeremy Leggett, a former petroleum geologist turned solar entrepreneur, said: \u201cAll this is beyond greenwash, but far short of retreat consistent with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points\">Paris [climate] agreement</a>. The oil and gas companies and are essentially taking out hedge bets.\u201d</p> <p>Still, observers think that big oil might really be serious about moving beyond petroleum this time round, for existential reasons.</p> <p>\u201cIt is different this time around,\u201d said Kretzschmar. \u201cThis [the rise of renewables, electric cars and other clean technologies] is for the first time starting to pose a threat to their oil and gas businesses. That wasn\u2019t the case in the early noughties.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fears of another plunge in Wall Street shares proved unfounded on Tuesday after the Dow Jones shrugged off an initial 500-point drop to post early gains. It was a volatile open session as shares fell further into the red before investors regained their nerve and the Dow rose 184 points or 0.6% to 24,527. The gains followed the biggest ever one-day points fall on the US index on Monday, when the Dow plunged by 1,175 as traders bet on interest rate rises. The FTSE 100 of Britain\u2019s biggest listed companies initially fell by 255 points or 3.5% to 7,079.41 as the turmoil spread to global markets. The index later recovered some of its losses, and was down 138 points or 1.9% at 7,196. Investors took fright elsewhere in Europe as trading got under way, with markets in Germany, France, Italy and Spain all down by more than 3%. \u201cThe stock market open in the UK and Europe looks about as bad as it can get,\u201d said Jasper Lawler, the head of research at online trading firm London Capital Group. \u201cThe bloodbath on Wall Street, which was repeated in Asia has seen confidence evaporate in Europe.\u201d Falls in Europe followed a near 5% drop in Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 index and a 3.3% fall on Australia\u2019s ASX200. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index declined by as much as 7% during the day\u2019s trade before a slight recovery to close down 4.7%. The Nikkei\u2019s decline of 1,071.84 points was its largest points fall since 2016. Maki Sawada, from the investment research and investor services department at Nomura Securities Co, said stocks were being sold in panic after the Wall Street losses. \u201cThe sell-off accelerated in a chain reaction,\u201d she told Kyodo News. Other markets across Asia also suffered losses. South Korea\u2019s Composite Stock Price Index fell by about 3% in morning trade. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index plunged 4.9% while the Shanghai Composite index lost 2.2%. These losses followed the dive in the Dow Jones industrial average on Monday, with investors appearing to react to equity losses and concerns that central banks will soon increase interest rates to rein in inflation. It coincided with the arrival of Jerome Powell as the new chair of the US Federal Reserve. \u201cThis was volatility unleashed,\u201d said Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer at at Cresset Wealth. \u201cIt\u2019s partially fear of interest rates, partially this new Fed chairman Jerome Powell, partially the market is overvalued relative to fundamentals.\u201d While market fear may not be based in any change in economic fundamentals, in its last meeting under chair Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve indicated it expects inflation pressures to increase through the year. According to projections released in December, officials expect three rate hikes in 2018 \u2013 so long as market conditions remain broadly as they are \u2013 but some economists believe the central bank could add another increase at its final meeting of the year. If the market falls continue they could prove problematic for Donald Trump who has consistently touted record high stock markets as proof that his presidency is boosting the economy. US stocks have now lost $1tn in value in the first five days of February. However, the White House, responding to the market drop insisted on Monday night that long-term economic fundamentals \u201cremain exceptionally strong\u201d. Vice President Mike Pence characterised the stock market\u2019s plunge as \u201csimply the ebb and flow of our stock market\u201d. On Monday, the FTSE 100 suffered its worst single-day slump since Theresa May called the snap election last April. The index fell 1.3% to 7,345 \u2013 having peaked at almost 7,800 last month \u2013 extending its longest losing streak since November into a fifth day. \u201cThe era of cheap money is ending, and for markets who got addicted to it, it\u2019s undoubtedly bad news,\u201d said Hussein Sayed, the chief market strategist at currency dealer FXTM.",

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u2013 which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u2013 coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe sell-off accelerated in a chain reaction,\u201d she told Kyodo News.<br></p> \n<p>Other markets across Asia also suffered losses.

Demand for gold fell by 7% year on year to just over 4,000 tonnes in 2017, the first fall since 2015, according to a report from the World Gold Council, which represents gold miners. Gold averaged $1,257.2 an ounce over the year, down 1% from 2016. Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to see overall gold demand down given the backdrop of monetary policy tightening and strong equity markets in 2017, but the market is not in bad shape.\u201d Central banks added 371 tonnes to their gold reserves last year, down 5% from 2016, with Russia and Turkey being strong buyers. Purchases of gold bars and coins were down 2% to 1,029 tonnes globally. The US had its worst year since 2007, with sales of bullion coins dropping sharply, partly because investors were lured to the S&amp;P 500 index and other stock markets as they reached new highs. Against this decline in investment, demand for gold from individuals and technology firms increased. Consumers in China, India and the US bought more gold jewellery as those economies improved, leading to the first annual increase in jewellery sales since 2013. Demand rose by 4% to 2,136 tonnes. Younger people now prefer to buy well-designed, lighter pieces made from lower-carat gold, often featuring coloured gems. That trend, which first emerged in Europe and the US, has been catching on in China, the world\u2019s biggest buyer of gold jewellery. \u201cIt\u2019s all about branding and design rather than big, thick pieces,\u201d said Hewitt. Nearly 333 tonnes of gold went into technology such as smartphones, laptops and cars last year, up 3% \u2013 the first annual increase in demand from the industry since 2010. Gold bonding wire is used in memory chips and sensors in next-generation smartphones, powering 3D video, virtual reality and facial and gesture recognition.

    "webTitle": "Network Rail boss Mark Carne to step down this year", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The head of Network Rail is to step down later this year, with his position having come under increased pressure from government. The announcement of Mark Carne\u2019s retirement comes just over four years after he joined the rail infrastructure company, taking over an ambitious but poorly costed programme of works that Network Rail soon concluded it could not deliver in full. It also follows the collapse of the East Coast franchise where Stagecoach, the parent company of Virgin Trains East Coast, has argued that delays to Network Rail works made its \u00a33.3bn contract untenable. The timing of Carne\u2019s announcement means a new chief executive will be in place before Network Rail\u2019s next five-year work programme begins in April 2019. The company is submitting a business plan this week, and Carne has pledged not to saddle the organisation with the kind of programme that left him facing parliamentary inquests after electrification schemes ran massively over budget. Carne, 58, a former Shell oil executive, came straight in at the top of the rail industry in January 2014. His tenure was shaped by the audit office\u2019s decision to reclassify Network Rail as part of the public sector, a move that turned off the easy credit that had allowed the industry to absorb unexpected costs, and put its spending under scrutiny. Joining the public sector also placed his \u00a3820,000 salary under scrutiny. After facing criticism during his first Christmas in the job when engineering works overran and prompted chaotic scenes at London stations, Carne saw some of the biggest projects in the company\u2019s history through to completion \u2013 notably London Bridge station, which opened on schedule at the start of 2018, and Birmingham New Street before. Carne was said by staff to have spent significant time with the frontline workforce and was a popular figure. The Network Rail chairman, Sir Peter Hendy, who will lead the search for a successor, paid tribute to Carne for delivering upgrades to the railway while personally championing better safety and working cultures. He said: \u201cHis leadership steadied the ship during the challenging transition to a public sector organisation and he has been the architect behind the huge positive changes in the company, driving transformation, devolution and efficiency, with an emphasis on equality and diversity too.\u201d The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said Carne had done an excellent job, and had provided strong industry leadership on safety and a programme to speed up the overhaul of signalling in order to bring new capacity to the railway. Grayling also applauded Carne\u2019s moves to devolve power within Network Rail to regional routes, which the minister said would \u201cbuild the foundations for a more efficient and passenger-focused organisation\u201d. Carne, who will remain in place during negotiations with the Treasury over Network Rail\u2019s next budget, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s railways matter to the lives of millions of people. The men and women who run the railway are enormously committed and it has been a privilege to lead the organisation at a time of huge investment and transformational change.\u201d",

His tenure was shaped by the audit office\u2019s decision to reclassify Network Rail as part of the public sector, a move that turned off the easy credit that had allowed the industry to absorb unexpected costs, and put its spending under scrutiny. Joining the public sector also placed his \u00a3820,000 salary under scrutiny. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>After facing criticism during his first Christmas in the job when engineering works overran and prompted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/29/network-rail-christmas-chaos\">chaotic scenes at London stations</a>, Carne saw some of the biggest projects in the company\u2019s history through to completion \u2013 notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/04/london-bridge-station-revamp-review\">London Bridge station</a>, which opened on schedule at the start of 2018, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/20/new-birmingham-new-street-amazing-just-first-impressions\">Birmingham New Street</a> before. </p> <p>Carne was said by staff to have spent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/10/train-toilets-to-no-longer-empty-on-to-tracks\">significant time with the frontline workforce</a> and was a popular figure. </p> <p>The Network Rail chairman, Sir Peter Hendy, who will lead the search for a successor, paid tribute to Carne for delivering upgrades to the railway while personally championing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/26/network-rail-boss-attacks-safety-record-macho-culture\">better safety and working cultures</a>.

      "bodyText": "It was just like the bad old days in financial markets. Screens in dealing rooms turned a sea of red as stock markets plunged in the familiar domino style: first Wall Street, then Asia and finally Europe. This was the first big share price fall of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency and there was a notable absence of tweeting from the White House boasting about how Americans had their president to thank for booming stock markets. Instead, there was talk of bubbles being burst following a rise of more than 40% in the Dow Jones industrial average since Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in November 2016. So far what has happened amounts to a correction rather than a crash. The 1,100-point drop in the Dow Jones sounds like a lot but in percentage terms it amounted to a decline of less than 5%. On two consecutive days in October 1929, the Dow plunged by first 13% and then 12%. The record one-day fall for the Dow was a 508-point drop in October 1987, which wiped more than 20% off the value of the US\u2019s leading companies. That was a crash, albeit a brief one. Shares were down sharply at the start of London trading but after a 3% drop the FTSE 100 recovered a bit of the lost ground and closed 193 points down on the day. Wall Street opened more than 500 points lower but, like the London market, steadied as morning trading wore on. Why are markets down? In part, because they have gone up too far too fast and were ripe for a fall. More importantly, it is because central banks have supplied copious amounts of money to the markets at ultra-low interest rates. In recent days, investors have looked at rising bond yields, higher wage growth and dearer commodity prices and started to fret about something that has not concerned them in recent years: inflation. They have woken up to the possibility that the Fed might get more aggressive in removing the stimulus provided since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. A dose of reality is no bad thing. Memories of the financial crisis have faded. During 2017, stock market volatility was low, investors started to take bigger and bigger bets on borrowed money and speculators discovered a new financial instrument in the form of bitcoin. All these were signs of a reckless over-confidence. James Bateman of Fidelity International said the stock market correction was a good thing. \u201cThe tech-fuelled rally in the US had long lost any sense of reality in its valuations, the prospect of inflation remaining low forever could not last, and we have a new and untested Fed chair,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be more worrying if markets didn\u2019t react to all of this.\u201d All that is true, and in the short term it is likely that share prices will bounce. Trump has a lot riding on the stock market continuing to rise and certainly did not choose Jerome Powell to be the chairman of the Fed because he thought his appointee was an interest-rate hawk. The falls on Wall Street were triggered by last week\u2019s labour market report, which showed unemployment at 4.1% and a pick-up in average hourly earnings. But Powell would not have to look all that hard to find reasons for a gradual, market-pleasing, rise in interest rates rather than rapid tightening. Wall Street investors are confident Powell will see them all right. If this all sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it is. During Alan Greenspan\u2019s long reign at the Fed, Wall Street knew the central bank would ride to the rescue every time share prices plunged. It became known as \u201cthe Greenspan put\u201d. A \u201cPowell put\u201d would be equally disastrous, not immediately but in the longer term. Why? Because it would reward recklessness, blow up an even bigger bubble and create the conditions for a rerun of 2008.",

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u2013 which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u2013 coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Why are markets down?

    "webTitle": "Pressure grows on DPD and Theresa May after courier dies of diabetes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Downing Street\u2019s adviser on modern work has described the death of a diabetic DPD delivery driver as \u201cshocking\u201d, as Marks &amp; Spencer said it would be seeking answers from the parcel company over the driver\u2019s treatment. Matthew Taylor said the government must urgently address poor quality work in Britain after the Guardian revealed how Don Lane, a 53-year-old father of one, collapsed and died from diabetes after being fined \u00a3150 by the courier company for attending a hospital appointment to treat his disease. Lane missed three other hospital appointments to treat kidney damage, partly because he was afraid of being fined. He collapsed at the wheel of his van while on deliveries a few months before dying in January. After the Guardian revealed the story, there were signs of a consumer backlash, with shoppers telling DPD and M&amp;S they would consider stopping using them because of Lane\u2019s treatment. One DPD customer wrote on the firm\u2019s online feedback form: \u201cHow about giving them some sick leave. Shocked by reports in the paper. Would think twice about using DPD if that\u2019s how you treat people.\u201d An M&amp;S customer posted on Twitter: \u201cIn future when I order online, especially with M&amp;S, if the delivery company is DPD I shall cancel the order and order with a company which doesn\u2019t use DPD.\u201d A spokesman for M&amp;S, one of the courier firm\u2019s biggest clients, said it was \u201cvery sad\u201d about Lane\u2019s death. It added: \u201cThe circumstances will be raised as part of our ongoing discussions with courier providers.\u201d Lane worked as a self-employed courier for DPD delivering parcels in Dorset on behalf of M&amp;S, John Lewis and Amazon. The company made more than \u00a3100m in profit last year, the equivalent of \u00a320,000 per courier, but does not provide sick pay or paid holiday. After the Guardian revealed the circumstances of Lane\u2019s death, it apologised for fining him in July but denied that when he first collapsed seven months earlier he was threatened with \u00a3150 charges. His death has increased the political pressure for reform of work practices at the bottom of the UK\u2019s labour market. On Wednesday, Downing Street is expected to finally announce its response to employment reforms proposed by Taylor last July, but the backdrop is now a chorus of anger from gig economy workers, consumers, trade unions and MPs united in opposition at how Lane was treated. The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, described Lane\u2019s case as heartbreaking. She said: \u201cBad conditions, bogus self-employment and the non-enforcement of rights have become all too common in Tory Britain and this case shows just how broken the system is. The government must now publish its long overdue response to the Taylor review and finally take action to tackle the Dickensian conditions too often faced by delivery drivers.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, the secretary general of the TUC, said it was \u201ca tragedy\u201d. She said Theresa May\u2019s response would be \u201can acid test\u201d of the government\u2019s commitment to \u201ccreating a Britain that works for all\u201d. Taylor, who was recruited by May to propose reforms to modern working practices shortly after she entered Downing Street, said: \u201cGenuine self-employment provides benefits which compensate for the fact that you don\u2019t have sick pay or consultation rights. The problem with the model that Don Lane was working under is that it looks as though you get very little of those upsides. His experience shows we urgently need to address poor quality work, particularly at the bottom of the labour market.\u201d In Scotland, more than 100 couriers for DPD have joined the GMB trade union and in December withdrew their labour for a day in protest at unilateral changes to their contracts and against the \u00a3150 fines. \u201cIt is a shocking story,\u201d said Cal Waterson, a regional GMB organiser. \u201cThere has been a strong backlash. We have a member in Scotland who had his licence removed by the DVLA because he didn\u2019t attend his appointments to control his diabetes. He missed the appointments because he couldn\u2019t get time off work.\u201d There was also widespread solidarity with Lane and his widow, Ruth, from other DPD depots. \u201c\u00a3150 is a lot of money for most people so people put their health second in order to provide for their family,\u201d said a DPD courier in Peterborough, who asked not to be named. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get away with it and Theresa May could do something about this but she seems to have no interest in looking after us. Society is getting more and more selfish.\u201d When first contacted for comment over Lane\u2019s death, DPD said it was shocked and saddened and said it did not know he had previously fallen into a diabetic coma or that he had vomited blood before his death. The firm said Lane had a quiet rural route that was convenient for his hospital appointments. DPD said on Monday it was ready to discuss customer concerns about Lane\u2019s death. A spokesman said: \u201cLike all companies, we make mistakes, and we have apologised profoundly for a mistake we made in Don\u2019s case.\u201d A spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy extended deepest sympathies to Lane\u2019s family and said: \u201cEmployers must take their employment responsibilities seriously.\u201d He added: \u201cWe recognise concerns that the UK\u2019s flexible labour market is not working fairly for everyone. That\u2019s why we asked Matthew Taylor to review modern working practices and the government will respond to the review shortly.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Coalition does not support requiring companies to lift wages in return for a corporate tax cut because such a plan would interfere with the free market, Mathias Cormann has said. The finance minister joins Bill Shorten and inequality experts in the labour movement in rejecting the idea, which has been proposed as a means to win public support for the Coalition\u2019s proposed corporate tax cut and boost stagnating wages. On Tuesday the Commonwealth Bank chief economist, Michael Blythe, said the government needed to \u201cthink about wages policy more broadly in Australia\u201d. \u201cOne interesting example here is what they appear to trying in Japan where [they] trade off company tax cuts in exchange for wage increases and more capital spending,\u201d he said. Asked if the Turnbull government could adopt the policy, Cormann told Radio National: \u201cWe don\u2019t support that sort of government intervention in the Australian market. \u201cThe way that everybody has the best possible way to get ahead \u2026 is by supporting the free market, free enterprise [and] reward for effort.\u201d Forcing companies to increase wages risked the government getting the decision wrong and \u201cincreasing the level of unemployment\u201d. Cormann said that when company tax cuts increased investment and unemployment declined, wage rises would follow \u201cas sure as night follows day\u201d. \u201cThat is the way it has always happened \u2013 anybody who argues against that argues against the existence of mountains in Switzerland.\u201d Despite the improved profitability of companies in 2017 and the strong rise in employment, Australia has been struck by stagnant wage growth including pay rises in enterprise agreements at a record low of 2.2% in the September quarter. Per Capita research fellow Tim Lyons told Guardian Australia the proposed wages fix was \u201ca pea and thimble trick\u201d that would see \u201ca wage increase eroded over time by inflation while granting a corporate tax cut that is forever\u201d. Lyons suggested that employers could grant a 4% wage increase to qualify for a tax cut, then claw it back over years by granting less generous wage rises in future. \u201cWhat guarantee is there if the companies just say \u2018I\u2019ll pay a wage increase\u2019? If it\u2019s not in a legally enforceable enterprise agreement, then it\u2019s just a thought bubble.\u201d Lyons said the government\u2019s proposed tax cut for companies earning more than $50m was \u201ca large unaffordable giveaway to large profitable companies ... and this is an attempt to present it as benefiting workers when the beneficiaries are shareholders\u201d. Labor has started 2018 with an aggressive pitch on inequality and wage growth, including considering pegging the minimum wage to median earnings to boost average wages as much as $80 a week. Asked about the idea of a compact for businesses to give wage rises, Shorten said \u201cpigs might fly\u201d. \u201cThe idea that, when you see a large company getting tax windfalls from their friends in the Turnbull government, that they\u2019re miraculously going to share this largesse with the workers of Australia, I\u2019m sorry, but that fairytale doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. The former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan said employers had to put a \u201cfirm proposal\u201d on the table to show they would share their profits or else they would simply increase executive pay or engage in share buybacks that enrich shareholders. \u201cBusiness has not used its increased profitability to increase wages,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody is going to take vague words that we \u2018might see it flow through\u2019 \u2013 people will want a concrete set of arrangements that result in a better division wage/profit share.\u201d Swan said that the corporate tax level had to be set at a rate to \u201cpay for economic and social infrastructure that makes the growth and pays the wages\u201d. \u201cA race for the bottom in tax doesn\u2019t deliver jobs and growth \u2013 it denudes the economy of the ability to pay for social goods.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Carillion's ex-bosses face MPs: questions they could answer", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Former executives of the collapsed government contractor Carillion will face questions on Tuesday from MPs on the work and pensions select committee and their counterparts on the business, energy and industrial strategy committee. The opening evidence session of their joint inquiry will be the first chance to hear former directors answer for their disastrous stewardship of a company that was responsible for providing an array of public services, from serving school dinners to prison maintenance. Among the witnesses are the former chief executive Richard Howson, who stepped down after a profit warning last July, and chairman Philip Green \u2013 a former adviser to Downing Street on corporate responsibility \u2013 as well as three of the company\u2019s former finance chiefs and the chair of the committee that set its pay policy. The grilling starts at 9.15am at Portcullis House in Westminster. Among the questions that Carillion\u2019s former bosses could face are: Why did directors not take steps sooner to increase payments to the company\u2019s pension scheme despite the trustees\u2019 pleas? In a letter to the work and pensions committee, Robin Ellison \u2013 who chaired the board of Carillion pension trustees \u2013 said he and his colleagues had pushed the company as hard as they could to increase payments to the retirement scheme. Yet when the firm collapsed, it left behind a \u00a3381m scheme deficit that is ultimately expected to saddle the Pensions Protection Fund with a liability of up to \u00a3990m, with pensioners likely to see their future payments cut by around 15%. Why were trustees\u2019 warnings not heeded? MPs are also likely to ask about the role of the Pensions Regulator. Why did Carillion raise its dividend every year including last year, when problems must have been building? As the trustees\u2019 pleas fell on deaf ears, directors were steadily increasing payouts to shareholders right up until the point that the company\u2019s demise was a realistic prospect. Between 2012 and 2016, Carillion doled out \u00a3376m to investors in the form of dividends, yet by the time it collapsed it had just \u00a329m in the bank. Why was action to conserve cash, including trimming dividends or cutting them altogether, not taken sooner and what did KPMG, under investigation by the accountancy watchdog for its auditing of Carillion, have to say about it? Why did the remuneration committee alter the bonus scheme in 2016 in order to make it more difficult to claw back payments? There are subtle differences between the company\u2019s 2015 pay rules and the ones published the following year. In 2015, bonuses were subject to \u201cmalus\u201d or \u201cclawback\u201d rules allowing the firm\u2019s remuneration committee to take back payments in a broad range of circumstances. The following year, the rules were changed so that clawback could only be applied if the results were misstated or directors were guilty of gross misconduct. Did this allow directors to scoop \u00a34m of bonuses that the government\u2019s official receiver may now struggle to reclaim, even if it tries? What efforts did Carillion make to raise funds from shareholders in the wake of last year\u2019s surprise profit warning? The rival outsourcer Capita announced a profit warning last month and said it would slash its dividend and tap investors for \u00a3700m to shore up its finances. According to the Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden, the company was taking the necessary measures in a timely fashion to avoid becoming the next Carillion. Why did Carillion\u2019s directors not take similar emergency measures prior to its huge profit warning in July last year, which marked the start of the firm\u2019s downward spiral? Did directors not realise that something was seriously wrong before that? When did the company first receive indications that its Aberdeen bypass and Royal Liverpool and Midland Met hospital projects were in serious trouble? Along with contracts in the Middle East, these three major projects were a big part of what went wrong for Carillion. Rising labour and raw material costs on contracts with wafer-thin profit margins make for a potent cocktail, but that didn\u2019t happen overnight. The company wrote down the value of contracts by more than \u00a31bn over less than six months last year but were there really no early warning signs? Did Carillion use its dominant market position to force small businesses in its supply chain to wait for months to be paid? The Federation of Small Businesses has said Carillion was a notorious late payer, often leaving small firms in desperate need of income hanging for more than 120 days. MPs will want to know whether it did this deliberately to prop up an ailing balance sheet and what that now means for those companies who were still waiting for their bills to be settled when the company went under. Expect questions too about government regulation of prompt payment. How much contact did directors have with government officials in the aftermath of the July profit warning? It will be all too tempting for MPs to seek to extract information about a lack of government oversight of Carillion. It might also be tempting for those directors to latch on to that narrative to ensure the role of the government gets at least as much attention as they do. The Cabinet Office has admitted that the role of crown representative \u2013 appointed to oversee struggling state contractors \u2013 was left empty for three months. The committees will want to know how closely Carillion was being watched as it continued to receive government contracts. Was the company in the habit of underbidding for contracts in order to win them, ultimately rendering those contracts unprofitable? Many outsourcing experts have expressed frustration with the economics of the industry since Carillion\u2019s collapse. When companies bid for public sector work, they aim as low as possible to ensure they get the gig. In one example, the Midland Metropolitan hospital, the terms were so unattractive that Carillion ended up as the only bidder. Another rival has claimed to the Guardian that Carillion was known for making low bids to get ahead of its rivals. If so, why did directors allow this risky strategy? Is the private finance initiative (PFI) model broken and what could be done to improve it or replace it? The collapse of Carillion has raised broader questions, from opposition MPs, small businesses and members of the public, about the way public services are farmed out to private companies. The aim of outsourcing is to reduce the cost to the state by exploiting competition in the private sector to drive down prices. But is there enough competition and are low prices always desirable when they encourage companies to load up on debt and make optimistic assumptions? Is the PFI model beyond repair? Should the Carillion board take sole blame for the company\u2019s collapse? Ultimately, the inquiry is about finding out why Carillion collapsed and who is to blame. Directors will shoulder most of the responsibility but they may not want to take it all. There are certainly questions to be answered about whether banks pulled the plug too soon, whether the government could have provided support to keep the company going and the impact of factors beyond Carillion\u2019s control, such as rising labour and raw material costs, fuelled partly by the national living wage and inflation in the wake of the EU referendum.",

Why were trustees\u2019 warnings not heeded?

An explainer Reserve Bank of Australia leaves interest rates unchanged amid market turmoil Thanks for reading and for contributions below the line. Press Association reports that oil giant BP has reported annual profits of US$6.2bn (\u00a34.4bn), up from US$2.6bn in 2016. For readers just (re)joining us, the Tuesday morning briefing is a handy catch-up of the last few hours of markets action: While you\u2019re at it, if you like waking up to a snappy news digest, you could sign up to receive the briefing as an email every morning: As Europe wakes up, here are some predictions for early action from IG: In Australia, the ASX200 ended the day down 3.2%, with the All Ordinaries was down 3.23%. That\u2019s a loss of around A$60bn from the Australian share market. After a day that saw it dip by 7.1%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index bounced back a tad to finish on -4.7% at 21,610.24 points. Stock markets across Europe are bracing themselves for huge falls after what was described as \u201ccarnage\u201d in indexes across Asia overnight. Falls in Japan and Australia were prompted by a plunging markets in the the US \u2013 with the Dow Jones on Monday experiencing its greatest one-day points fall in history. The FTSE 100 was expected to fall nearly 4% on opening. That follows a 6% drop in Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 index and a 3.3% fall on Australia\u2019s ASX200. \u201cThere\u2019s genuine carnage out there,\u201d Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG in Australia, told the Washington Post. \u201cEveryone is just running for the hills because nobody actually knows what is causing this move.\u201d In Japan, the Nikkei\u2019s decline of 1,071.84 points was its largest point fall since 2016. Maki Sawada, from the investment research and investor services department at Nomura Securities Co, said stocks were being sold in panic after the Wall Street losses. \u201cThe sell-off accelerated in a chain reaction,\u201d she told Kyodo News. Other markets across Asia also suffered losses. South Korea\u2019s Composite Stock Price Index fell by about 3% in morning trade. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index plunged 4.9% while the Shanghai Composite index lost 2.2%. Read the full report: US president Donald Trump \u2013 always swift to claim the highs of the stock market for himself \u2013 has been so far quiet on Monday\u2019s plunge. But vice-president Mike Pence, on his way to South Korea for the opening of the Winter Olympics has told reporters that the Dow dip \u2013 the worst losses for six-and-a-half years \u2013 was \u201csimply the ebb and flow of our stock market\u201d. The fundamentals of the US economy were, Pence said, \u201cvery strong\u201d and the economy itself is \u201con the move\u201d. A quick round-up of the latest in the Asian markets doesn\u2019t show much pick-up: S&amp;P mini futures down 3%. MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 4.3%. Nikkei down 6.8%. Taiwan shares down 5.5%. Hong Kong Hang Seng Index down 4.9%. Federal MPs from both sides of the political divide have urged Australian investors not to panic after the share market suffered a A$50bn-plus sell-off, AAP reports: Australian shares shed over 200 points or over 3.5% by late trading on Tuesday, more than doubling the sell-off of the previous day. Treasurer Scott Morrison believed the big dive on the US stock market was a recalibration associated with recent economic data. He told reporters in Canberra the market was reacting to last week\u2019s US wage data and more bullish sentiment about what\u2019s happening with inflation and its impact on bond markets: Markets are volatile. When they recalibrate in relation to events like this, you do see a bit of these events happening. But people who watch these markets more and participate in them more closely than I do, I think, will see this for what it is and understand the forces behind it.\u201d Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen said self-funded retirees who relied on their share portfolios would obviously be concerned, but people understood that share markets go up and down: That is the nature of the stock market. I\u2019m sure people are keeping a close eye on it but I do think it\u2019s important to keep it in that context.\u201d Share market volatility aside, Trade Minister Steven Ciobo said the Australian economy was behaving \u201cexceptionally strongly\u201d: We are seeking really strong economic growth in Australia. We are seeing great employment creation.\u201d Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, following the central bank\u2019s first board meeting of the year, said he expected economic growth to pick up to above three per cent over the next couple of years \u2013 a pace not seen consistently for a number of years. Spot the difference: The FTSE is set to open a huge 4.7% down according to online trading company IG. Thats big in anyone\u2019s books. That decline is the Nikkei\u2019s biggest point drop since November 1990, Reuters has pointed out. Japan\u2019s afternoon trading session is not looking pretty: losses are now hovering around 7%. A few moments ago the Nikkei 225 index was 21,078.71 points \u2013 a tumble of more than 1600 points since yesterday\u2019s close. There\u2019s an hour left before close of trading at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, at which point we\u2019ll have a better sense of the historical context of the falls. Maki Sawada, from the investment research and investor services department at Nomura Securities Co, said stocks were being sold in panic after the Wall Street losses. She told Kyodo News: \u201cThe sell-off accelerated in a chain reaction.\u201d Meanwhile, bitcoin has dipped below US$6,200 for the first time in three months. Six weeks after its record high of $19,511, bitcoin dropped to $6,190, with warnings it could plummet further. Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at AxiTrader, told AFP: The risk-off tone is hitting Bitcoin almost as hard as a global regulator and bank scrutiny. The latest dent to the Cryptospace has been banks saying they are shutting down the ability of clients to buy bitcoin with their cards. This could end up a full round trip back into the $1,850/$2,966 region. Consumer spending remains a concern for the Reserve Bank of Australia, which has again left the cash rate on hold at 1.5%. At its first meeting of 2018 on Tuesday, the RBA board decided to leave the cash rate at the record low level it has now held for 18 months. Governor Philip Lowe said business conditions were positive and increased public infrastructure spending was supporting the economy, but the outlook for household consumption remains uncertain. Read the full report: Associated Press reports: Shares tumbled in Asia on Tuesday after a wild day for US markets that resulted in the biggest drop in the Dow Jones industrial average in six and a half years. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index skidded 6.1% percent to 21,296.03 by early Tuesday afternoon. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index lost 4.9% to 30,651.31 and Australia\u2019s benchmark S&amp;P ASX 200 had skidded 3.3% to 5,828.40. South Korea\u2019s Kospi declined 2.9% to 2,418.70 and the Shanghai Composite index was off 2.2% at 3,412.55. All other regional markets were lower. The losses in Asia tracked the Dow\u2019s 1,175 point plunge on Monday, its worst point drop of all time and its worst percentage decline since August 2011. \u201cThere would be few places to hide from the risk-off atmosphere that is expected to extend its stay in Asian markets today in a significant manner,\u201d Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary. \u201cThis is fear rolling over itself.\u201d Panic in other markets can send investors racing for the \u201csafe haven\u201d of Japanese yen holdings, she noted. That is painful for Japanese and other regional export manufacturers, whose competitiveness is hurt by stronger currencies that push their prices relatively higher. The U.S. dollar weakened against the Japanese yen early Tuesday, trading at 108.61 yen, down from 109.12 on Monday. Australian shares shed four months of gains in just morning trading, with all sectors losing ground. With afternoon trading under way in Japan, the losses on the benchmark Nikkei 225 index have now passed 6%. A few moments ago the index was at 21,243.15 points, a decline of 1438.93 points (6.34%) since yesterday\u2019s close. Here\u2019s AAP\u2019s take on that RBA decision: The Reserve Bank of Australia has left the cash rate unchanged at 1.5%, citing continuing concerns about weak household consumption. Following its first meeting of 2018, the RBA board left its official interest rate at the record low level it has now held for 16 months. The central bank said in a statement accompanying the February decision that while business conditions and investment were improving, household consumption remains \u201ca continuing source of uncertainty\u201d. The Australian dollar, already losing ground after worse than expected retail and international trade data, fell following the RBA\u2019s decision and was at 78.61 US cents at 1437 AEDT, from 78.73 US cents ahead of the announcement. The statement from the RBA explains: The low level of interest rates is continuing to support the Australian economy. Further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected, although this progress is likely to be gradual. Taking account of the available information, the Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. The cash rate will remain unchanged at 1.5%, according to a statement from the RBA\u2019s governor, Philip Lowe. Markets in Japan have taken a hit in morning trade after the steep plunge in the US Dow Jones industrial average in the United States. By the close of morning trade on Tuesday, Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 index had fallen 5.26% to 21,487.87 points, its lowest level since October. It had fallen by as much as 5.64% about 11am local time before recovering slightly. Trading will soon resume for the afternoon session. If the Nikkei 225 finishes the day around the same level, according to a Kyodo News report: It would be the largest single-day drop since it plunged over 1,286 points in June 2016.\u201d Hiroshige Seko, the economy minister, vowed to \u201cclosely monitor the market\u201d. But in an attempt to ease the local jitters, he said: Corporate profits are at record-high levels, and the Japanese economy\u2019s trend is nothing to be pessimistic about.\u201d Kyodo News interviewed a tax accountant, 49, who, while watching a stock price display in Tokyo, didn\u2019t seem to be singing from the same song sheet as the minister: It reminds me of what happened at the time of the Lehman shock. I hope prices will stop falling soon.\u201d TOPIX, a broader index that accounts for all first-section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, declined 4.99% in morning trade. According to a TOPIX breakdown, the biggest losses were in the glass and ceramics sector (down 7.13%), nonferrous metals (down 6.54%), insurance (down 6.45%), and metal products (down 6.35%). The mid-session report from CommSec warns this is the worst day for Australian equities in almost two years: The Australian market is slumping by almost 3% at lunch; the worst day for local equities in 20 months following a massive tumble for US shares overnight, which takes the ASX 200 to a three-and-a-half month low \u2026 Locally, all sectors are coming under substantial pressure with all stocks on the ASX 200 index (with the exception of gold stocks) slumping. Energy stocks are the worst performers, dropping by 4%, with Woodside (WPL) and Santos (STO) leading the falls. Tech stocks, retailers and healthcare are down by ~3%. CommSec expects the RBA to keep interest rates at their current level; the announcement is expected within the next half an hour: The Reserve Bank (RBA) will almost certainly keep rates on hold this afternoon at 2.30pm AEDT. Economists will be paying close attention to the accompanying one-page statement by the central bank and comments about the Aussie dollar and wages growth. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Hong Kong-listed Chinese firms is down by 5.15%: Here\u2019s how things stood globally at 2am GMT: Tokyo Nikkei 225: DOWN 5.1% at 21,529.19 Hong Kong Hang Seng: DOWN 3.2% at 31,225.11 Shanghai Composite: DOWN 2.1% at 3,415.86 Euro/dollar DOWN at $1.2384 from $1.2373 at 2200 GMT Pound/dollar DOWN at $1.3972 from $1.3958 Dollar/yen DOWN at 109.08 yen from 109.13 yen Oil West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 56 cents at $63.59 per barrel Oil Brent North Sea: DOWN 58 cents at $67.04 per barrel New York DOW: DOWN 4.6% at 24,345.75 (close) New York S&amp;P 500: DOWN 4.1% at 2,648.94 (close) London FTSE 100: DOWN 1.5% at 7,334.98 (close) US S&amp;P 500 futures, the world\u2019s most liquid, tumbled 2.5% to four-month lows in Asian trade on Tuesday as the sell-off triggered by worries about inflation showed no sign of abating, Reuters reports. They fell to as low as 2,542, the weakest levels since early October, and 11.7% below their record peak of 2,878.5 touched on 29 January. David Bassanese, chief economist at BetaShares Capital, tells us: The first thing is that the market was severely overbought coming into February, so the markets were looking for an excuse to sell off. The payrolls number on Friday provided a powerful reason to do so. What was a surprise was the speed of the selloff on Friday and Monday. It was pretty sizeable. But I still think it\u2019s more of a correction than an end of the bull market, although the Dow Jones is off quite a bit already. The key thing is the US wages number. The markets will be nervous waiting for the next payroll at the start of next month. If it goes up, get very worried. But in the last few years every time wages have spiked they\u2019ve fallen back again. Amid the global market jitters, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index has now lost more than 5% in morning trading. At last check it has fallen 1,201.61 points to 21,480.47 points (-5.3%). China and Hong Kong stocks have taken a tumble on opening. There was a drop of 2% for both the CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index, while the Hang Seng saw a 3.8% dip. Neatly encapsulated by Bloomberg here: And here we go: China\u2019s markets are the next to open: Paul Dales, chief Australia and New Zealand economist at Capital Economics, tells us: The selloff seems due to reconsideration by the markets of how rapidly rates might rise this year. And that seems to have been triggered by data figures showing a rise in US wage growth on Friday. The most important question is will it continue? We expected wage increases to pick in the US and for the Fed to pick up the number of rate rises this year. So on that basis it will be sustained. That said, we feel the equities market will be underpinned by reasonably strong growth this year in the world economy. So it\u2019s hard to see equities fall sharply. They might finish the year lower than they started but they won\u2019t fall sharply because of the expected growth in the global economy. In the midst of a very turbulent day, Guardian Australia cartoonist First Dog on the Moon has this helpful offering: the last thing you ever need to read about blockchain. Probably. Australia has slipped to a trade deficit of A$1.36bn (US$1bn) in December, from a revised A$36m surplus in November, AAP reports. Exports were up 2% for the month while imports were 6% higher, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. The Australian dollar has fallen from 78.85 US cents ahead of the data release to 78.67 US cents. The latest from Tokyo: The Nikkei 225 index is continuing to dive deeper. It\u2019s now lost nearly 1,100 points in early trade. The latest figures (at 9.45am Tokyo time) show a drop of 4.83% to 21,586.31 points. Masahiro Ichikawa, a senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co, told the Kyodo news agency: \u201cWe expect the Nikkei will face resistance at 21,500.\u201d Ichikawa added that investors would also keep an eye on the yen\u2019s movement against the US dollar. The market would be further weighed down if the US dollar dropped below the 109 yen line, Ichikawa told Kyodo. Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, has thoughts on the Australian market response ahead of the announcement by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) at 2.30 pm AEDT (3.30am GMT): The local stock market will open sharply lower this morning but could outperform US markets if the current sell-off extends over coming weeks. At 15.9, the blended forward PE on the ASX 200 is above the 2013-17 average of 15.2. However, at 2.83% the 10-year bond yield is still below the 3.05% average that applied during that period. The upcoming profit-reporting season could also help the local market fall less than the US if the current sell-off extends. Oil fell last night while base metals were slightly firmer. This indicates that pressure on oil markets is largely about concerns over increasing shale oil supply rather than a general risk off move in commodities. The Aussie dollar, on the other hand has been a risk off casualty, falling heavily against major currencies. The market impact of major data releases today including retail sales, balance of trade and the RBA statement could be important in that context. Markets would be encouraged if retail sales data can provide further comfort that consumption has continued to recover from its late winter/early spring funk. After half an hour of trading in Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index has dropped 4.28% to 21,710.20. That\u2019s a fall of 971.88 points. And it doesn\u2019t appear we\u2019ve seen the bottom yet. Mining stocks are down 4.45%, oil and coal down 4.58%, and insurance stocks are down 5.44%, according to a breakdown of sectors in Japan\u2019s TOPIX index. Associated Press has some useful context for the day\u2019s \u201cbiggest ever points drop\u201d: The Dow\u2019s plunge was the biggest ever in terms of points, but on a percentage basis, it was only its 100th worst single day drop, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. It had a larger percentage drop as recently as August 2011. The Dow\u2019s steepest percentage decline was on Black Monday on 19 October 1987, when it fell 22.6%. The 10 largest point declines 5 February 2018: Close 24,345.75 Decline in points -1,175.21 Decline in % -4.6 29 September 2008: Close 10,365.45 Decline in points -777.68 Decline in % -7 15 October 2008: Close 8,577.91 Decline in points -733.08 Decline in % -7.9 17 September 2001: Close 8,920.70 Decline in points -684.81 Decline in % -7.1 1 December 2008: Close 8,149.09 Decline in points -679.95 Decline in % -7.7 9 October 2008: Close 8,579.19 Decline in points -678.92 Decline in % -7.3 2 February 2018: Close 25,520.96 Decline in points -665.75 Decline in % -2.5 8 August 2011: Close 10,809.85 Decline in points -634.76 Decline in % -5.6 14 April 2000: Close 10,305.78 Decline in points -617.78 Decline in % -5.7 24 June 2016: Close 17,400.75 Decline in points -610.32 Decline in % -3.4 Back in Australia, the market lost A$52bn (US$41bn/\u00a329bn) in its first four minutes of trading this morning \u2013 that\u2019s a drop of 2.7%. Monday had already seen a loss of A$30bn. Japan\u2019s Nikkei share average has fallen to its lowest level since late October 2017, Reuters confirms. My colleague Daniel Hurst reports from Tokyo: The Nikkei Index 400 is down 3.81% in early trade in Japan, while the Nikkei mid and small cap index has plunged 4.41%. Stock markets in Japan and South Korea have just opened with an immediate drop, as expected. Within minutes, the Nikkei 225 index was down by more than 3.3%. This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog while Graeme Wearden grabs some sleep. We\u2019ll be sticking with the Asian and Australian markets news right here. Bloomberg have calculated that Monday\u2019s Wall Street rout wiped $1.25 trillion off the US stock market. That wipes out all the gains recorded in early 2018, when Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts sparked a rally. The Australian stock market has tumbled on opening and investors are bracing for more big losses on Tuesday in the wake of a chaotic day of trading on Wall Street. The ASX was down 2.71% or 163 points early Tuesday, the worst fall, so far, since June 2016. Before the market opened futures were down 139 points, and the Australian dollar slipped below the US79\u00a2 mark. It comes in the wake of a wild day on Wall Street in which the Dow ended up down 1,175 points, a slump of 4.6% - which is the US stock market\u2019s worst day in more than six years - and a day after Australian markets fell 1.55%. CommSec chief executive Craig James said the market \u201ccorrection\u201d had further to go. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to remember these US markets were at all time highs, record highs, he said, adding: \u201cThis is an orderly correction [to] more normal levels, fairer markets. The concern is that the US economy is doing too well and that could mean higher interest rates. Share markets have gone too far and need to correct to normal levels.\u201d Earlier the Treasurer Scott Morrison tried to calm nerves about the fall, describing it as a recalibration. \u201cMarkets are volatile - when they recalibrate in relation to events like this you do see a bit of these events happening,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people who watch these markets more and participate in them more closely than I do, I think, will see this for what it is and understand the forces behind it.\u201d Last Friday, the latest US jobs report sparked worries over the prospects for inflation and a surge in bond yields, as well as concerns the Federal Reserve will raise rates at a faster pace than expected. Newsflash: Australia\u2019s stock market has fallen by 2.7% at the start of trading. The reverberations from Wall Street\u2019s slide are rippling through global markets. More to follow... CNBC\u2019s Matthew Taylor warns of a rough start to trading in Australia... Stock market traders in Japan should prepare for a very turbulent day.... Markets in Asia are set to open lower on Tuesday, with Nikkei futures down more than 3% after the U.S. stock market rout, says Marketwatch. Some experts are blaming computerised trading systems for fuelling today\u2019s losses. Certainly, there was something unnerving about the way the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted to a 1,500 point loss in the final hour of trading, shedding 700 points in just six minutes. Could algorithmic trading strategies have caused it, by firing out fresh sell orders every time the Dow slipped lower? Steve Wachtel, portfolio manager of SSI Investment Management, told Reuters: \u201c[It was a] Sharper sell-off than we expected but it\u2019s technical based with mostly the machines selling. Seemed like there was a minor flash crash there around noon. We look at the credit markets closely when there is a large equity sell-off and the credit markets are still very healthy, just moderate spread widening today.\u201d Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA also blames computer-based trading. A brief flash crash on Monday afternoon saw the Dow shed more than 1,500 points, a large chunk of which occurred in a very short period of time. Naturally there is a lot of questions being asked about the role of automated trading in the collapse and I\u2019m sure the discussion will happen over the coming days but the important thing is that markets recovered from the initial shock. Here are a few photos from Wall Street\u2019s brutal and dramatic day: Although the Dow gets a lot of attention (especially when it plunges over 1,000 points), we should remember it only contains 30 companies. They\u2019re mostly big household names - like Boeing (-5.7% today), Pfizer (-5.3%), Coca-Cola (-3.9%), Intel (-3.5%) and Apple (the best performer, down only 2.5%). The S&amp;P 500 is a broader measure. And it also had a rough day, down over 4% in its biggest selloff since August 2011. Reuters has more details: The benchmark S&amp;P 500 and the Dow suffered their biggest percentage drops since August 2011 as a long-awaited pullback from record highs deepened. The financial, healthcare and industrial sectors fell the most, but declines were spread broadly as all major 11 S&amp;P groups dropped at least 1.7 percent. All 30 of the blue-chip Dow industrial components finished negative. With Monday\u2019s declines, the S&amp;P 500 erased its gains for 2018 and is now down 0.9 percent in 2018. Here\u2019s how the US, Canada, Mexico and Brazilian stock markets ended on Monday evening: Here\u2019s my colleagues Philip Inman and Ed Helmore on today\u2019s drama: US stocks took a further steep plunge on Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1,179 points, the largest one-day points fall on record and erasing all the gains made so far this year. The drop came after another bad day on global markets as investors reacted to global equity losses overnight and concern that central banks will increase interest rates in response to inflationary pressures from surging global economies. The Dow dropped 1,600 points in one instance before bouncing back. The index is now off more than 1,800 points over two days of trading. \u201cThis was volatility unleashed,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at at Cresset Wealth. \u201cIt\u2019s partially fear of interest rates, partially this new Fed chairman Jerome Powell, partially the market is overvalued relative to fundamentals.\u201d If the falls continue they could prove problematic for president Donald Trump who has consistently touted record high stock markets as proof that his presidency is boosting the economy. A new job is always a learning curve. But spare a thought for Jerome Powell, America\u2019s new top central banker. Powell formally took over from Janet Yellen as head of the Federal Reserve today, and straight into a day of market mayhem. One factor driving the sell-off, it seems, is concern that the Fed may be more hawkish than expected under Powell - and raise interest rates aggressively. The latest US jobs data, released last Friday, showed a big jump in wage growth - which could push inflation higher. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 began the week by shedding 108 points or 1.5% to a two-month low of 7334 points. City firm IG is currently predicting that it could fall by over 250 points when trading resumes on Tuesday. I must repeat that these futures markets can change significantly overnight - but it shows that Tuesday could be another dramatic day in the markets.... Naeem Aslam of Think Markets predicts further losses in the days ahead, given the ferocity of today\u2019s sell-off. By looking at the market reaction today, one thing is for certain that we are in for a rough ride and Trump can\u2019t blame this one on Obama. I have a strong feeling that this sell off is going to intensify because bears are seeing blood on the street. Asia-Pacific markets are likely to suffer fresh losses when they open for Tuesday\u2019s sessions. The news that Wall Street has suffered its worst day in six years will surely spook investors. The Japanese Nikkei is currently being called sharply lower - but that could change by the time trading begins in a couple of hours. Here\u2019s a flavour of Bloomberg\u2019s take on the market rout: U.S. stocks plunged the most in 6 1/2 years, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 1,100 points, as the equity selloff reached a fever pitch amid rising concern that inflation will force interest rates higher. Treasuries rallied and gold rose on haven demand. Volatility roared back into American equity markets, as the S&amp;P 500 Index sank 4.1 percent to wipe out its January gain and turn lower on the year. The index capped its worst day since the U.S. lost its pristine credit rating, topping the rout that followed China\u2019s shock devaluation of the yuan, the Brexit selloff and jitters heading into the presidential election. Trading volume was almost double the 30-day average. All but two stocks in the broad gauge declined. \u201cThis is classic risk off that may not end any time soon,\u201d says Win Thin, head of emerging-market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. Financial blogger Josh Brown has put today\u2019s rout into historical context... Today\u2019s sell-off is truly historic, in one sense. The Dow has never, ever, suffered a 1,500 plunge during a single trading session before. And it has never before posted a quadruple-digit fall on a single day. Monday\u2019s wild selloff has firmly beaten the previous biggest points fall, of 777 points - set during the 2008 financial crisis. We shouldn\u2019t get too carried away, though; in percentage terms, today\u2019s selloff is less dramatic - but still the worst in six years. The Washington Post sums up today\u2019s wild trading thus: The Dow Jones industrial average plunged a heart-stopping 1,500 points in afternoon trading on Monday before gaining back some ground \u2014 and finishing at 24,342, or down 4.6 percent \u2014 as volatility returned to the stock market with a vengeance after a year of rare tranquility. The Dow has swung more than 2,100 points in the last two sessions, a decline pushing more than 8 percent and shattering long-term momentum. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has suffered its worst day in over six years. After a wild trading session, the Dow has ended down 1,175 points at 24,345 points. That\u2019s a slump of 4.6% - which is the US stock market\u2019s worst day in over six years. There were also heavy losses on the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices, which both lost around 4% (updated). Investors in Australia are bracing for another volatile day when their markets open in a few hours. The futures market suggests there could be some sharp losses. The benchmark Australian index, the S&amp;P/ASX200, is being called down 88 points, or almost 1.5% That follows Monday\u2019s losses, as Australian Associated Press explains: The Australian market on Monday lost around $33 billion after a sharp fall in US markets last Friday sent local investors running for the exits. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index fell 95.2 points, or 1.56 per cent, to 6,026.2 points while the broader All Ordinaries index tumbled 101.4 points, or 1.63 per cent, to 6,128.4 points. ... Locally, in economic news on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia holds its monthly board meeting and announces its interest rate decision. The Australian Bureau of Statistics releases December retail trade figures, plus international trade in goods and services data, also for December. CNBC is calling today\u2019s sell-off \u2018whipsaw trading\u2019. With 10 minutes to go, the Dow is deep, deep, deep in the red, down over 1,000 points or 4%. Wall Street\u2019s fear index is surging. The VIX index, which tracks volatility, has more than doubled to 35.7, its highest level since August 2015. Manufacturing group 3M is the biggest faller on the Dow right now, down 5.5% Oil firms Exxon and Chevron are close behind. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 latest market report: U.S. stocks sold off sharply on Monday, with the Dow industrials falling back below 25,000, as a pullback from record highs deepened and investors grappled with rising bond yields and potentially firming inflation. All three major U.S. indexes fell more than 1 percent while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 2 percent. Late in the session, the Dow is down more than 1,000 points. The energy, financials and healthcare sectors fell the most, but declines were spread broadly as all major 11 S&amp;P groups dropped. During Monday\u2019s session, the benchmark S&amp;P 500\u2019s fall on Monday put its pullback from its Jan 26 record high at more than 6 percent. Friday\u2019s jobs report sparked worries over the prospects for inflation and a surge in bond yields, as well as concerns the Federal Reserve will raise rates at a faster pace than expected. Benchmark 10-year note yields pulled back after surging to 2.885 percent overnight, the highest since January. Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist with Allianz Global Investors in New York says: \u201cWhen you have rates moving upwards, typically what happens is that financial conditions tighten, things like bank lending, mortgage lending start to slow and then the economy is at risk of a potential downturn.\u201d This is an astonishing selloff. Shares are going through the floor on Wall Street. The Dow just extended its losses to 1,500 points - a fall of over 6% today. Christopher Vecchio of Daily FX suspects that the political tensions in Washington are contributing to the declines. ALERT: The Dow just plunged by 1,000 points, or almost 4%, wiping out all this year\u2019s gains. Update: The Dow just lost 800 points, or 3%, as this trading session turns increasingly wild. Today\u2019s sell-off is actually threatening to exceed Friday\u2019s slide. Worries over looming US interest rates, and the recent losses in the government bond market, are hitting shares harder in New York. Another wave of heavy selling has swept the Dow down by over 760 points - on top of Friday\u2019s 665.75 drop. That takes the index firmly under the 25,000 mark, at 24758 With one hour\u2019s trading to go, can investors pull it back? If not, it\u2019s going to be another day of chunky losses on Wall Street.... Digital currencies are also being hit hard today. Bitcoin has slumped by 18% to $6703 -- a fall of almost $1,500. December\u2019s record high of almost $20,000 feels a long way away. The sell off comes after Britain\u2019s Lloyds Bank said it wouldn\u2019t let customers buy digital currencies on their credit card - for fear of being left with hefty losses. With regulators in the UK, the US, China and South Korea all probing bitcoin, Miles Eakers of foreign exchange firm Centtrip predicts it will soon hit $5,000. Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever has spotted something... I guess the president has been busy with one thing or another... The S&amp;P 500, which is a broader (and arguably better) measure of the US stock market, is also falling again. It\u2019s down 1.6% at 2,717.48 points, a drop of 44 points. As things stand, the Dow has lost more than 1,000 points over the last two trading sessions. Once upon a time, that would have been a proper slump. But it\u2019s actually only a 4% drop - thanks to the surge in stock prices over the last year. This is turning into a very skittish session on Wall Street. With 90 minutes trading to go, the Dow is now down 535 points, or over 2%. That takes it down to the 25,000 point mark - which it had smashed through for the first time at the start of January. Wall Street is solidly in the red again, with the Dow down almost 500 points (1.8%). Back on Wall Street, the sell off is speeding up. The global share sell-off from Friday has continued at the start of the new trading week, with European markets falling back and Wall Street going through a volatile start to the day. Amid signs of a stronger global economy, investors are worried that central banks might raise interest rates and stop the flow of cheap money more precipitously than previously expected. Stronger than expected US non-manufacturing data only added to the idea that a March rate hike is on the cards from the Federal Reserve, with up to another three to follow. European markets were also playing a bit of catch-up - or catch-down - since the bulk of Friday\u2019s falls on the Dow came after European traders had packed up for the weekend. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 108.45 points or 1.46% lower at 7334.98 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.76% to 12,687.49 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.48% down at 5285.83 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.64% to 22,821.63 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended off 1.44% at 10,064.5 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.48% to 853.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 370 points. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the day and be back tomorrow, barring any major developments before then. Thanks for reading and for all your comments. In fact Wall Street is now on the slide once more, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 300 points, in a marked sign of the current volatility. The Dow has fluctuated between a high of 25,520 at the open and a low of 25,165. Wall Street may be recovering, somewhat, but European markets remain under pressure. The FTSE 100 has dropped 1.46%, the biggest one day percentage fall since Theresa May called her snap general election on 18 April last year. This is the fifth consecutive day of losses for the UK\u2019s leading index, and leaves it at its lowest level for around two months. The current stock market falls are a blip and not the start of a slide, according to Charles Stanley. Chief investment officer Jon Cunliffe said: Today\u2019s equity market wobbles belie positive corporate earnings and we think today\u2019s falls should be regarded as a buying opportunity. The fourth-quarter earnings season painted a bright picture of good earnings deliver from companies across the globe. The positive relationship between a stronger global economic growth and revenues, with corporate earnings supported by improving pricing power supports margins. Today\u2019s \u2018sell-off\u2019 does not change this and we expect strong earnings growth to continue, with central banks being careful not to upset the apple-cart. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 70 points - not the day\u2019s best but by no means the worst either. European markets, however, are showing little sign of improvement. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: European markets are firmly in the red as the global sell-off in stocks has taken hold. Ever since the US posted strong average earnings last Friday, traders have been rattled by the prospect of tighter monetary policy around the world. Economic indicators in the US, Europe and Asia point for a need to tighten up monetary policies from various central banks. Equity traders were enjoying a bullish run recently, and the jolt from the major decline in the US last Friday has triggered a worldwide round of profit taking. [In the US] traders are getting used to the idea that US interest rates could be hiked four times this year. Last Friday acted as a remained that stock markets don\u2019t go up in a straight line forever, and now we are seeing some short covering and bargain hunting. Chris Beauchamp, IG\u2019s chief market analyst, said: Signs of a recovery are in evidence on Wall Street, as the dust settles from what was one of the most volatile weeks in recent memory. Humans being what they are, the sudden downdraft seemed much worse than it was, especially compared with the volatility of 2015, but in reality it marks a return to a more normal market. Only time will tell whether we are about to see a resumption of the rally, or a bigger selloff. From current activity, it looks like calm has returned, with steady dip buying been seen on both sides of the Atlantic. It will take more than a few days of chaos to disrupt this bull market. Earnings season continues to provide the good news investors want to see, and while central bank tightening remains a worry, there is little sign that the Fed is in any hurry to quicken the pace. Draghi also warned: New headwinds have arisen from the recent volatility in the exchange rate, whose implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability require close monitoring. The eurozone economy is growing more strongly than expected, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, is telling the European parliament. But despite being more confident about the path of inflation, the bank still needs to be patient about monetary policy, he says. In his opening remarks, Draghi said: While we can be more confident about the path of inflation, patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy is still warranted for underlying inflation pressures to build up and inflation to converge durably towards our objective. The recovery in US markets has done little to help their European counterparts, which are still nursing losses of around 1% (German\u2019s Dax excepted). Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Though the Dow Jones avoided the precipitous plunge promised by the index\u2019s futures, that ended up meaning very little to the European indices. Given that at one point the index was nearing 25100, the fact that it is flat around the 25500 mark is something of a coup for the Dow Jones. A stellar ISM services PMI likely helped, with the figure coming in far higher than forecast at 59.9, against the 56.5 expected and the 55.9 seen in December. The dollar, meanwhile, got revenge on the pound for its last few months of misery. Cable dropped 0.9%, informed not only by the new wave of hawkishness to hit the markets and that strong ISM non-manufacturing PMI, but the UK\u2019s own 17 month low-striking services reading and the Tories\u2019 latest round of Brexit in-fighting. Sterling also struggled against the euro, falling 0.6% to \u20ac1.128, its worst price against the single currency in 2 and a half weeks. Unusually the FTSE could find no joy in the pound\u2019s problems. The UK index was too busy dealing with the market-wide fear that a further rise in interest rates is on its way, sliding 1.1% as the day went on. The Eurozone indices, meanwhile, were a mixed bag. The DAX managed to reduce its losses to just 0.4%, following the Dow\u2019s lead, but with the French CAC and Spanish IBEX down 1.1% and 1.2% respectively. Quite some turnaround on US markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down less than 100 points and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are in positive territory, helped by a rebound in technology stocks. Intel, for example, is higher on reports that Apple could use its chips in the next generation iPhone. The latest ISM surveys point to 3% growth in the US this year, as well as making a March rate hike likely barring unforeseen circumstances, says economist James Knightley at ING Bank: Both the non-manufacturing and the manufacturing ISMs are at incredibly strong levels, backing our call of 3% GDP growth in 2018. The US ISM non-manufacturing index has risen from a reading of 56.0 in December to 59.9 for January, suggesting the bad weather at the beginning of the month has failed to dent the US economy\u2019s momentum. In fact the headline index is at a twelve year high with the sub-components looking incredibly strong - employment is at its best ever level in the series\u2019 near 21 year history while new orders are at a seven year high. Production also rose while new export orders gained thanks to stronger global demand and the weaker dollar. With the non-manufacturing at 59.9 and the manufacturing ISM index at 59.1 versus a break-even 50 level the US economy looks in fantastic shape right now with tax cuts and the possibility of infrastructure investment adding more fuel to the fire. With wage growth also showing signs of life there is going to be growing pressure for the Fed to raise its economic forecasts and signal the potential for four rate hikes when they update their numbers at the March FOMC meeting. It will take something really big to prevent a March rate hike, with the most likely factor probably being a damaging government shutdown. In that regard Thursday is the next key date and so far there has been little sign of movement to break the deadlock. Following the better than expected non-manufacturing survey, Anthony Nieves, chair of the Institute for Supply Management, said: The non-manufacturing sector reflected strong growth in January after two consecutive months of pullback. Overall, the majority of respondents\u2019 comments are positive about business conditions and the economy. They also indicated that recent tax changes have had a positive impact on their respective businesses. Here are some of the comments from those taking part in the ISM survey: \u201cExecutive management [is] excited about tax breaks for CapEx purchases in [the] new tax bill.\u201d (Information) \u201cMonth-over-month steady growth, on average, [is] 3 percent on project volume and 1 percent on total revenue.\u201d (Construction) \u201cSigns of strong growth [in] financial performance expectations given the recent tax changes.\u201d (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u201cPositive outlook for 2018. We see huge pricing pressure.\u201d (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u201cBusiness is starting off solid.\u201d (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u201cFirst quarter begins slow like 2017, but expect things to pick up later in Q1. Outlook continues to look bright for 2018.\u201d (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) \u201cBusiness activity is low due to the continued partial funding [of] bills passed (continuing resolutions).\u201d (Public Administration) \u201cOverall, sales velocity looks strong. Some regional differences due to weather conditions, but overall, a strong month.\u201d (Wholesale Trade) Part of the reason for the current volatility in the stock market is the prospect of the Federal Reserve raising US interest rates perhaps four times this year, as wage growth and inflation pick up. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The latest non-manufacturing figures may not be ground-breaking but the above expectations uptick will certainly be welcomed by the US government as it looks to further establish its jobs-boosting credentials. President Trump continues to boast of the success of his infrastructure investment and tax reforms, with the labour force and market growth both seemingly in rude health. The question now will be how these will affect interest rate decisions and how early the next hike will come. The markets have already priced in a heavy chance of a rate rise under new Fed Chair Jerome Powell next time out, and with a buoyant economy, stronger downward pricing pressures may well be needed in the coming months. And here\u2019s the other US service sector survey, and that has come in much stronger than expected. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI rose from 56 in December to 59.9 last month, better than the forecast figure of 56.5. This is the highest since August 2005, and will give more fuel to the argument that the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates several times this year. And here\u2019s a White House reaction to the current market turmoil, courtesy of CNBC: The US service sector is growing in line with expectations, according to the latest Markit survey. Its final service sector PMI for January came in at 53.3, in line with the initial estimate and down from the December figure of 53.7. The composite reading was also as forecast at 53.8, slightly lower than December\u2019s 54.1. In a few minutes, we get the day\u2019s other US data, the non-manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management. One of the biggest US fallers is Wells Fargo after the Federal Reserve announced on Friday that the bank would be barred from growing past its $1.95tn assets, until it had improved its governance and controls. After Friday\u2019s falls, US markets are continuing their decline, as investors continue to worry about rising interest rates and the removal of central bank support. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which dropped 666 points on Friday, is down another 214 points or 0.8% in early trading. This is, so far, a better performance than the worst predictions. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.94% and the Nasdaq Composite fell just over 1%. The FTSE 100 is currently down 1.13% at 7359, but is off the day\u2019s low of 7334. And with the weaker than expected UK services sector survey, the pound is continuing to decline, down 0.7% at $1.4019. Wall Street futures have come off their worst levels, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now tipped to open around 153 points lower. Stock markets around the world took another pummelling on Monday as investors continued to fret over rising U.S. bond yields. In Europe, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 lost 1.4% to 7,343 while France\u2019s CAC 40 slid 1.4% to 5,288. Germany\u2019s DAX shed 1% to 12,654. Wall Street was poised to open lower with Dow futures and the broader S&amp;P 500 futures down 1%. Market jitters have spread after last week\u2019s performance in U.S. stock markets, when they endured their worst week in two years amid worries over rising Treasury yields. Fears of a sharp drop have ratcheted higher after 2017\u2019s strong performance carried over into January. An upbeat U.S. jobs report showing higher than expected wage growth was the catalyst for the latest sharp sell-off on Friday, further stoking speculation the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates faster than expected to counter inflation. Higher bond yields make it more expensive for companies to borrow and potentially depresses the U.S. economy and earnings. They also can make bonds more attractive to investors than stocks. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA in London, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a sharp increase in U.S. bond yields over the last week after the Federal Reserve released a more hawkish than expected statement (on Wednesday), alongside its monetary policy decision, and the jobs data reported a significant increase in earnings.\u201d \u201cMarkets now have three rate hikes this year more than 50 percent priced in and some people are even anticipating a fourth, which is unusually ahead of current Fed forecasts.\u201d The pound is also having a bad day. It\u2019s currently down 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.4045, a one-week low. Brexit uncertainty may be hurting sterling, as the UK cabinet argues over Britain\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU: The sell-off across Europe\u2019s trading floor is intensifying, dragging the Stoxx 600 down 1.3%. This means European stock markets have now fallen pretty steadily for a week. And here\u2019s why! The Wall Street futures are deteriorating, suggesting the Dow Jones industrial average could shed 300 points (on top of Friday\u2019s 665 slump). Shares in London are dropping deeper into the red, following the news that Wall Street will fall at the open (at 2.30pm UK time). The FTSE 100 is now down 98 points, or 1.3%, at 7,344 points - a new two-month low. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says investors are reacting to the prospect of higher interest rates this year. The era of cheap money is ending, and for markets who got addicted to it, it\u2019s undoubtedly bad news Societe Generale (SG) are also concerned that shares and bonds are both falling. Don\u2019t panic! That\u2019s the message from Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer of wealth management at UBS. He argues that investors should sit tight, rather than ditching shares in response to the sell off. Maefele writes \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that now is a time to reduce exposure to stocks. As long as the recent rise in bond yields moderates, we are confident that market conditions will remain orderly.\u201d Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, points out that markets did enjoy stellar returns last year: The start of the week has been a mirror image reversal to the optimism expressed in the start of the year and indeed in the last thirteen months when many major markets had raised over 25%-40%. After such a great performance some meaningful pullback is to be expected. The FTSE 100 has shed more than 1% this morning within hours of opening, taking the index under 7400. This also ends the remarkable rally that the markets have been experiencing the past year.\u201d Ouch! Bitcoin is now down 6% at $7690, a new two and a half-month low. The futures market is indicating that America\u2019s stock market will fall at the open, extending last week\u2019s declines. The Dow is being called down 130 points, a drop of around 0.5%, having shed 665 points on Friday night. That\u2019s not a crash (of course!) but it may add to concerns that the market is experiencing a substantial correction after a very strong year. James Hughes of AxiTrader says: Stocks look like they are set for a correction of some sorts after huge losses over the last few sessions that has left many bulls worried that the bull run may have come to an end. On Friday the Dow dropped over 600 points with the S&amp;P and Nasdaq following suit. This morning Europe is catching the virus and is aggressively lower. The issue with this kind of fall is that it becomes a snowball effect, and after such astronomical gains since election day 2016 the falls can be equally as aggressive, but nobody could say that a correction hasn\u2019t been due. Jeremy Warner of the Daily Telegraph fears that a major stock market correction is looming. Today\u2019s losses mean that FTSE 100 has shed around 5% since mid-January. But it\u2019s still around 2.5% higher than a year ago: Newsflash: Another 452 workers at stricken UK outsourcing group Carillion are being made redundant. That\u2019s on top of the 377 who were laid off on Friday. That flurry of data hasn\u2019t changed the mood in the markets. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 and the European Stoxx 600 are both at two-month lows, as the global share rout continues. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says: Volatility has returned with a vengeance and investors who had been hoping that the new week would see some respite from the selling have been left disappointed. European equity markets have now erased all their year to date gains as the market has reversed its euphoric start to the year and left investors with nowhere to hide. Newsflash: Growth in Britain\u2019s service sector slowed sharply last month, as Brexit fears hit companies. That\u2019s according to data firm Markit, whose UK service sector PMI fell to 53.0 last month, down from 54.2 in December and closer to the 50-point mark that shows stagnation. This is the weakest reading since September 2016. Service sector bosses reported a slowdown in new work -- due to \u201cthe loss of existing clients and lingering concerns surrounding the UK\u2019s exit from the EU\u201d. Last week, Markit reported that UK manufacturing slowed in January, while construction slipped towards stagnation. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says Britain\u2019s economy seems to have slowed. \u201cThe pace of UK economic growth slowed sharply at the start of the year as January saw a triple- whammy of weaker PMI surveys. \u201cService sector expansion slid to a 16-month low, reflecting a marked waning in growth of demand for business and consumer-facing services such as hotels and restaurants. Demand for transport and communication services was down for the second straight month. \u201cThe softer service sector growth follows news of the manufacturing upturn losing momentum at the start of the year and a near-stagnant construction sector. All together, the PMI surveys point to the slowest pace of expansion since August 2016. \u201cWhile the fourth quarter PMI readings were historically consistent with the economy growing at a resilient quarterly rate of 0.4-0.5%, in line with the recent GDP estimate, the January number signals a growth rate of just under 0.3% Quite a contrast with the eurozone, which posted its strongest month in over 11 years.... No sign of a recovery in the markets. After almost 90 minutes trading the FTSE 100 is still down 80 points, with most shares in the red. The slump in British car sales has continued. The number of new car registrations shrank by 6.3% year-on-year in January, with 163,615 vehicles driven away. Diesel sales suffered another sharp slump, down 25.6% during the month. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders blamed \u201cconfusion over government policy\u201d towards diesel cars, following the emissions scandal. The SMMT says: Demand fell across the board, with registrations by business, private and fleet buyers down -29.7%, -9.5% and -1.8% respectively. Meanwhile, continuing the trend of recent months, dual purpose cars (SUVs) were the only vehicle segment to see growth, with demand up 6.6% to account for a fifth (20.2%) of all new car registrations. Demand in all other segments fell, with the biggest declines affecting the mini, MPV and executive segments. Petrol sales rose by 8.5%, while electric cars surged by 23.9% compared with a year earlier. UK car sales shrank in 2017, for the first time in five years. Some good news! The eurozone\u2019s private sector has posted its strongest monthly growth in over a decade. Markit\u2019s \u2018composite eurozone PMI\u2019, which tracks activity across the region, rose to 58.8 in January from 58.1 in December. That\u2019s the highest reading since June 2006, and shows Europe\u2019s economic recovery remains on track. Here\u2019s the details: Bitcoin is also having a rough morning, after a UK bank launched a crackdown. The digital currency has shed 3.5% to $7,889, close to the two-month low it hit on Friday. Overnight, Lloyds Banking Group announced it has banned credit card customers from buying bitcoin. It fears that they could be left nursing heavy losses if prices fall. Anyone who bought bitcoin last December, when it peaked at around $20,000, has already suffered sharp losses.... We\u2019re seeing an rough start to trading in London, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx, with all January\u2019s and most of December\u2019s gains now been wiped out. Campbell writes: There were ugly, ugly scenes after the bell, as the market-wide sell-off gathered pace on fears that global interest rate are, sooner rather than later, going to be heading higher. The FTSE quickly shed 1% this Monday, taking the index to sub-7400 levels not seen in 8 weeks. The UK index\u2019s sharp losses over the last 3 weeks have effectively wiped out the remarkable, record-breaking rise it saw in the pre- and post-New Year period, with little good news on the horizon to rescue it from its current levels. Nearly every share on the FTSE 100 has dropped this morning, as the blue-chip index slides to its two-month low. Mobile phone network operator Vodafone is leading the selloff, following reports that it could buy European assets from Liberty Global. Budget airline easyJet is also under pressure, after rival Ryanair warned that trading this year could be tougher than expected. The only risers are DIY chain Kingfisher and hotels and coffee shop chain Whitbread. Traders will be watching nervously to see how the US stock market opens in five hours time, says financial analyst and journalist Louise Cooper. Other European stock markets are also falling in early trading, dragging the benchmark Stoxx 600 down by over 1%. Fears over the bond market (see earlier post), and the looming prospect of higher interest rates are hitting shares in Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid and Milan. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets argues that this \u2018correction\u2019 is overdue. The biggest sell-off for the equity markets in nearly two years is here as investors are reacting to surging global bond yields. Friday\u2019s equity markets rout is likely to extend as the futures of the US stock indices are indicating. However, there isn\u2019t much to worry about because corporate profits are still rising and chances of US recession are remote. So this may only be a healthy pullback which the investors have been waiting for some time. A 10% correction could take place as this was long overdue. In other words, the long-term momentum for the equity markets is only easing off as these markets have been defying the Newton Law of Gravity. Investors in London are playing catch-up after Friday afternoon\u2019s sharp selloff on Wall Street (which accelerated after UK traders had gone home for the weekend). Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The next day after an unusually big sell-off is always a big test of a market\u2019s strength. A repeat of anything close to the 2% decline seen in US indices on Friday could trigger a prolonged period of risk-off sentiment. Last week the S&amp;P 500 dropped -3.8%, with the energy sector leading the declines. After gains of 6% in January, the first few days of February were always going to be at risk of profit taking. And we\u2019re off! Trading is underway in the City, and there are losses across the board as investors join the global sell-off. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has shed 80 points, or 1.1%, taking the blue-chip index down to 7360 points. That\u2019s its lowest level since 8th December. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, reckons that the markets could suffer a 10% fall - but not a full-blown crash. He writes: The past week has seen shares come under pressure as Fed rate hike expectations increased, partly reflecting an acceleration in US wages growth, and the bond yield rose sharply. From their recent high, US shares have fallen 3.9% making it the deepest pullback since a 4.8% fall prior to the November 2016 US election. It\u2019s likely the pullback has further to go as investors adjusts to more Fed tightening than currently assumed \u2013 we see four (or possibly five) Fed rate hikes this year against market expectations for three - and higher bond yields. This will impact most major share markets, including the Australian share market which is vulnerable given its high exposure to yield plays like real estate investment trusts and utilities. However, the pullback is likely to be just an overdue correction (with say a 10% or so fall) rather than a severe bear market \u2013 providing the rise in bond yields is not too abrupt and recession is not imminent in the US with profits continuing to rise. So the two key questions are how severe the back up in bond yields will be and whether a recession is approaching? Government bonds are falling in early trading, extending their recent losses. The yield, or interest rate, on German 10-year bonds has hit its highest level since September 2015. It\u2019s still low in historical terms, at just 0.77%, but it shows that prices have hit their lowest in almost two and a half years. Bonds are being hit by worries about rising inflation, which would put pressure on central banks to raise interest rates. US government debt (Treasury bills) have weakened sharply - pushing the yield on 10-year Treasuries to a four-year high. UK government debt is also weakening, pushing up the yield on 10-year gilts to the highest level since May 2016. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The financial markets are a sea of red this morning, as the biggest sell-off since Donald Trump won the US presidency gathers pace. Investors are increasingly spooked that global interest rates are heading higher, bringing the long era of loose monetary policy and easy money to a close. On Friday, Wall Street suffered its biggest decline since the Brexit vote. The Dow tumbled by 2,5%, or almost 666 points in a nervy selloff (the biggest points fall since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Europe and Asia are now following suit. Over in Japan, the Nikkei has fallen by 2.5% \u2013 it\u2019s biggest fall since the US presidential election in November 2016. There were also losses in South Korea (-1.1%) and Australia (-1.5%). Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at AxiTrader in Australia, warns: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a nervous start to the week for traders across all markets as they wonder if last week\u2019s reversal in US stocks and the ugly close Friday ... is likely the start of something bigger, In London, investors are bracing for the FTSE 100 to shed more than 1% when trading begins at 8am GMT. Government bonds are also falling, amid growing concern that America\u2019s central bank will hike borrowing costs more aggressively than expected. Some analysts think that Fed could raise rates four times this year \u2013 the market had previously only priced in three rises. Traders will also be watching for a new healthcheck on the world\u2019s service sector companies.

Humans being what they are, the sudden downdraft seemed much worse than it was, especially compared with the volatility of 2015, but in reality it marks a return to a more normal market. Only time will tell whether we are about to see a resumption of the rally, or a bigger selloff. From current activity, it looks like calm has returned, with steady dip buying been seen on both sides of the Atlantic. It will take more than a few days of chaos to disrupt this bull market.

A stellar ISM services PMI likely helped, with the figure coming in far higher than forecast at 59.9, against the 56.5 expected and the 55.9 seen in December. </p> <p>The dollar, meanwhile, got revenge on the pound for its last few months of misery. Cable dropped 0.9%, informed not only by the new wave of hawkishness to hit the markets and that strong ISM non-manufacturing PMI, but the UK\u2019s own 17 month low-striking services reading and the Tories\u2019 latest round of Brexit in-fighting.

In fact the headline index is at a twelve year high with the sub-components looking incredibly strong - employment is at its best ever level in the series\u2019 near 21 year history while new orders are at a seven year high. Production also rose while new export orders gained thanks to stronger global demand and the weaker dollar.</p> <p>With the non-manufacturing at 59.9 and the manufacturing ISM index at 59.1 versus a break-even 50 level the US economy looks in fantastic shape right now with tax cuts and the possibility of infrastructure investment adding more fuel to the fire. With wage growth also showing signs of life there is going to be growing pressure for the Fed to raise its economic forecasts and signal the potential for four rate hikes when they update their numbers at the March FOMC meeting.</p> <p>It will take something really big to prevent a March rate hike, with the most likely factor probably being a damaging government shutdown.

From their recent high, US shares have fallen 3.9% making it the deepest pullback since a 4.8% fall prior to the November 2016 US election. It\u2019s likely the pullback has further to go as investors adjusts to more Fed tightening than currently assumed \u2013 we see four (or possibly five) Fed rate hikes this year against market expectations for three - and higher bond yields.</p> <p>This will impact most major share markets, including the Australian share market which is vulnerable given its high exposure to yield plays like real estate investment trusts and utilities. However, the pullback is likely to be just an overdue correction (with say a 10% or so fall) rather than a severe bear market \u2013 providing the rise in bond yields is not too abrupt and recession is not imminent in the US with profits continuing to rise. So the two key questions are how severe the back up in bond yields will be and whether a recession is approaching?</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ShaneOliverAMP/status/960329434749321216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oliver&#39;s Insights: Correction time for shares?

      "bodyText": "Labor is pressing the Turnbull government for a federal investigation into Adani, arguing the commonwealth has responsibility for sensitive wetlands contaminated near the Great Barrier Reef after Cyclone Debbie. Guardian Australia revealed last week concerns that Adani submitted an altered laboratory report while appealing a fine for contamination of the Caley Valley wetlands on the Queensland coast. The wetlands were blackened by coal-laden water released from the Abbot Point port after Cyclone Debbie\u2019s torrential rains inundated its coal storage facilities in March 2017. Federal Labor has grabbed last week\u2019s Guardian report as it hardens its public position on Adani\u2019s controversial Queensland mine project. On Tuesday in parliament, pressing for a federal investigation of Adani\u2019s conduct, the shadow environment minister, Tony Burke, pointed out that environmental approvals for the Adani Abbot Point terminal placed conditions on the project, including the downstream impacts on the Caley Valley wetlands. Burke asked, \u201cgiven the minister has responsibility for the wetlands\u201d, when would the federal government investigate Adani\u2019s conduct and report publicly. But the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, insisted the \u201cprimary regulatory authority\u201d for the project was the Queensland government. Frydenberg said Labor\u2019s positioning on Adani was about the looming Batman byelection, where Labor faces a challenge from the Greens to hold the seat in inner-city Melbourne, rather than matters of policy substance. Shadow cabinet discussed options for toughening Labor\u2019s stance on the Adani mine on Monday night and the issue also dominated the Labor left caucus meeting, where differing views were expressed by MPs. Labor is mulling legal options but some in the opposition are concerned a sharp move against the project will trigger a significant backlash about sovereign risk, and have negative implications in both Queensland and other coal regions. Asked on Sky News on Tuesday about the implications if Labor ultimately adopted a position of reversing approvals for the Adani project, the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, dead-batted. \u201cWe\u2019re getting very far ahead of ourselves,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers battled through \u201ctough\u201d trading conditions in January as consumers preserved their cash for essential food shopping and shunned big ticket purchases. Non-food sales declined by 1.2% in the three months to the end of January with furniture sellers, shoe shops and high street clothing retailers recording their worst performance since 2009, according to British Retail Consortium (BRC) and KPMG data. There was better news for supermarkets after like-for-like food sales increased by 2.9%, but with all the extra spending accounted for by higher prices. The squeeze on consumer spending power hit the broader services industry, which suffered its worst month since the aftermath of the EU referendum, and also triggered a slump in car sales, according to industry figures that show the UK economy entering the new year on a downbeat note. The BRC/KPMG survey showed that overall like-for-like retail sales rose 0.6% in January, compared with a fall of 0.6% for the same month in 2017. Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said: \u201cThe persisting tough trading environment played out at the start of the year with a mixed set of trading updates and subsequent announcements.\u201d She said that the sector continued to struggle from \u201cdivided fortunes\u201d for food and non-food sales. The Bank of England expects wages growth to rise above the current level of 2.5% during the the year ahead and inflation to fall from it current level of 3%. In the meantime, British households are in the midst of an income squeeze as higher inflation and sluggish wages growth eat into their disposable incomes. The latest health check of the services sector \u2013 that includes hotels, restaurants, transport and financial services \u2013 from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) found that a loss of clients and lingering Brexit uncertainty had led to a dip in activity. The monthly purchasing managers\u2019 index fell from 54.2 points in December to 53.0 in January, its weakest since September 2016 and only slightly above the 50.0 cut-off point between expansion and recession. Services account for almost four-fifths of the UK\u2019s gross domestic product, but similar surveys for manufacturing and construction released last week also showed signs of slower UK growth at a time when other major economies \u2013 the US, the eurozone and Japan \u2013 have been expanding strongly. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said the three PMI surveys were consistent with the economy growing at 0.3% in the first three months of 2018, down from 0.5% in the final quarter of 2017. The car market was another victim of the squeeze on consumer spending, with sales down by 6.3%. It follows a downward trend that started last April after years of record growth.",
