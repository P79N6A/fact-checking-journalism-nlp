      "bodyText": "Changing shape takes time, said GlaxoSmithKline chief executive Sir Andrew Witty. He\u2019s right. GSK\u2019s three-part transaction with Novartis in vaccines, oncology and consumer products, announced 10 months ago, is still only \u201con track\u201d for completion in the first half of this year. Meanwhile, the spin-off of Viiv, the HIV business, has become a \u201c2016 event\u201d, assuming it happens, despite being first aired last October. Glacial Glaxo then? That may be a little unfair. The Novartis deal does indeed look hellishly complicated to execute \u2013 500 lawyers are working on the details. As for Viiv, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any risk in warming up potential investors slowly. Witty is excited that sales of two new HIV drugs are \u201cahead of original expectations\u201d, Viiv, where GSK owns 80%, is reckoned to be worth \u00a310bn-\u00a315bn. If current sales success means the upper end of the range is more likely, take your time. What shareholders really want to know, though, is when GSK\u2019s share price graph will change for the better. The shares stand at \u00a314.76, roughly where they were in 2012. In that time AstraZeneca\u2019s have improved 50%, albeit with some tickling from Pfizer\u2019s non-bid, and biotech valuations have headed towards the moon (albeit not yesterday as Gilead of the US bombed). The excitement has entirely escaped GSK. The main cause is well known. In respiratory drugs \u2013 the core of the pharmaceutical division \u2013 GSK has suffered patent expiries and tougher pricing tactics by US healthcare insurers. The drag was one reason why 2014\u2019s group-wide performance was filed under \u201cchallenging\u201d. Sales fell 3% and operating profits were 6% lower at \u00a36.59bn. Thus the need for Witty\u2019s reinvention plan for GSK to take effect. Shareholders are starting to worry about their dividend. A same-again 80p a share has been promised for 2015 but the arithmetic is becoming tight: earnings per share for 2014 were 95p, a very high payout ratio. The good news \u2013 finally \u2013 is that there are definite signs of a turn. Witty is holding to his pledge that sales from respiratory products will return to growth in 2016. That is critical. And the Novartis deal, when it arrives, ought to deliver a shot of adrenalin. In essence, each company will concentrate on what it does best. Thus GSK is selling oncology, buying vaccines and the pair are pooling resources in toothpastes, painkillers, nicotine gums, etcetera. There ought to be an effect in 2016, if only from cost-saving. Assuming that is the case, and assuming Witty\u2019s bullish tone on the drugs pipeline is justified, the dividend should be safe. The yield is 5.4%. That looks more tempting than, say, the near-6% available at BP and Shell. Put simply, GSK looks more a master of its own destiny than the oil majors. Progress is slow at GSK \u2013 but there is progress. Don\u2019t bid Sky-high Nice profits and impressive subscriber figures, Sky. Are you now about to blow the gains by paying a silly price for the next set of Premier League football rights? The answer will arrive soon. The deadline for bids for the seven packages of games for 2016-19 is on Friday. Two extreme outcomes are possible. The first would see Sky and BT bid high and boldly. BT Sport is the first serious, and well-funded, rival to emerge to Sky Sports. Perhaps Sky has to demonstrate who is boss. For all the company\u2019s boasts about the breadth of its offer in sport, movies and entertainment, nobody really knows how the business would behave without leadership in Premier League matches. And, from BT\u2019s standpoint, it is in the game now; it won\u2019t want less than its current two-package collection of games, and won\u2019t want to let a newcomer (like Discovery) get a sniff. Under the other extreme outcome, both main rivals might reflect that they are carrying the financial equivalent of a groin strain and thus bid conservatively. In BT\u2019s case, Ofcom has just imposed a so-called \u201cmargin squeeze\u201d test to regulate the wholesale prices it can charge for fibre broadband access. The cost of offering \u201cfree\u201d football to broadband customers must be reflected in the calculations. BT passes the test today. But if it were to grab, say, five packages it might have to introduce up-front charges for BT Sport. That\u2019s risky. The case for caution is strengthened by BT\u2019s defensive line-up. From next season, it has three years of exclusivity on Champions League and Europa League games. Sky\u2019s handicap is the debt it is carrying after buying all of Sky Italia and most of Deutschland \u2013 \u00a36.3bn. It can\u2019t afford to blow the doors off. The City\u2019s best guess is that Sky retains five packages but has to pay about \u00a31.05bn a season, versus \u00a3760m currently. That\u2019s the base case. Anything much above that figure will look like over-payment.",

      "bodyText": "Starbucks has made a small profit in the UK for the first time since the world\u2019s biggest coffee bar chain brewed its first drink in Britain 17 years ago. The UK business, which runs or franchises 791 coffee shops, made a pretax profit of \u00a31.05m last year, Starbucks said. Persistent losses in previous years had seen Starbucks UK accused of paying millions in royalties and interest from Britain to other Starbucks companies overseas in order to lower its British tax bill. A Reuters investigation in 2012 highlighted how Starbucks UK had booked cumulative sales of more than \u00a33bn since opening in Britain but had paid only \u00a38.6m in corporation tax over the same period. The revelation led to Starbucks executives being summoned before parliament and to calls for a consumer boycott. Responding to widespread anger, then UK boss, Kris Engskov, pledged to waive tax deductions for royalties and interest during 2013 and 2014. That \u201cdeductions holiday\u201d period expired at the start of last month. Starbucks had promised this would generate additional tax of \u00a320m for HMRC. On Tuesday it declined to say publicly whether or how that commitment had been met, but privately claimed it had been satisfied \u2013 though it refused to give further details. The group declined to comment on whether the controversial tax deductions had resumed. In previous years, controversial royalty payments depressed taxable profits in the UK and flowed into a complex web of Starbucks companies centred in the Netherlands. There the group\u2019s aggressive tax structure ensured income was taxed only at a very low rate. That Dutch structure is now the subject of an investigation by the competition officials at the European commission. Investigators suspect the Dutch tax authorities should never have given approval to Starbucks\u2019 structure because the tax consequences are so generous as to amount to illegal state aid, though they have yet to reach a final conclusion. The US group\u2019s statement on Tuesday selected only highlights from the full accounts for its UK business, which are yet to be filed with Companies House. In the statement, the managing director, Mark Fox, described breaking into profit as \u201can important milestone for the business\u201d after a loss of \u00a320.5m for the previous year. Gross profit for the year to 28 September 2014 rose 24% to \u00a398.8m. No sales figures were given. Taxed at the statutory rate of 22%, 2014 profits would have generated about \u00a3232,000 for HMRC. But Starbucks indicated its tax charge will in fact be \u00a312m. The group refused to disclose a breakdown of the factors contributing to this tax liability, only one of which will have been the self-imposed tax deduction holiday. That means it remains difficult to see how close Starbucks came to its 2012 promise of a supplementary tax payment to HMRC of \u00a320m over two years.",

      "bodyText": "A day after pushing towards a new record high, leading shares have come off the boil. With weak Chinese services data - prompting a cut in the country\u2019s reserve ratio - and another drop in the oil price hitting the commodities sector, the FTSE 100 slipped 11.78 points to 6860.02. Ahead of a meeting between new Greek finance minster Yanis Varoufakis and his German counterpart Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, worries about the prospects for Greece and the eurozone re-emerged, adding to the general jittery feeling. David Madden, market analyst at IG, said: The possibility of another round of the Greek debt crisis and a slide in natural resources stocks is a worrying scenario for markets. The admission by the Greek finance minister that the country is \u2018bankrupt\u2019 set the wheels in motion for a day of selling, and the failed attempt by Beijing to spur economic activity by slashing the central banks\u2019 lending requirements cemented it. The mining sector initially jumped on the back of the news from Beijing, but it isn\u2019t nearly enough to coax traders into buying mining stocks and the sector is squarely in the red. Eurozone equities are on edge as Greece is at loggerheads with Frankfurt again, and neither side wants to back down. The biggest faller in the leading index was Hargreaves Lansdown, down 79p at 966p after the investment group\u2019s half year profits fell from \u00a3104.1m to \u00a3101.9m. Among the commodity companies, Tullow Oil lost 21.5p to 395.9p, Anglo American fell 20p to \u00a311.50 and BHP Billiton dropped 31.5p to \u00a315.27. But Sky climbed 12.5p to 955.5p following its latest results while ITV rose 8.1p to 230.6p after Credit Suisse issued an outperform rating. Arm added 32p to \u00a310.69.after it unveiled a new chip design - the Cortex-A72 - for smartphones and tablets which promises improved performance and graphics. Drug companies were among the main risers. AstraZeneca ended 46.5p better at \u00a346.88 after it received planning consent to build a new global research centre and headquarters in Cambridge, which will employ around 2,000 people and become operational at the end of 2016. Meanwhile GlaxoSmithKline climbed 23p to \u00a314.76 as the company said it would decide by the middle of the year whether to float off its HIV medicines business, which could be worth up to \u00a318bn. Fourth quarter sales of \u00a36.19bn were more or less in line with expectations, and the company said the first half of 2015 would continue to be difficult before conditions improved in the second part of the year. It later announced it would sell up to 4.47m shares - its entire stake - in Danish biotechnology company Genmab to institutional investors. But Smith and Nephew slipped 7p to \u00a311.68 despite the prospect of US predator Stryker making a bid. Analysts at Piper Jaffray said: Based on our channel checks and view that Stryker does not want to be third in the orthopedic market where it competes (behind Zimmer Biomet and Johson &amp; Johnson), we do believe that the company will indeed purchase S&amp;N. By our estimate, S&amp;N would be at least $0.50 accretive (probably closer to $0.75) to Stryker\u2019s 2016 earnings per share (we assume it will take at least nine months to close). From a regulatory perspective, we do ot believe that either the EU or US Federal Trade Commission would challenge the deal or require a meaningful level of divestiture to complete the deal. Dixons Carphone edged up 2p to 431p after Barclays dismissed concerns about the effect of proposed consolidation the mobile industry would have on the company. Analysts Christodoulos Chaviaras and Maurice Patrick said: In light of BT and 3UK entering into exclusive talks to buy EE and O2, respectively, we analyze the potential impact network consolidation could have on Dixons Carphone\u2019s profitability and conclude that investors may be overly pessimistic. We would not dismiss that network consolidation will be a prevailing theme in 2015 but our analysis suggests that at the current share price investors already assign a 50% probability for Carphone UK to be worthless. We understand that Dixons Carphone has signed binding long-term contracts with all network operators at least until 2020 that should support mid-term profitability. The worst case scenario in which all networks abandon Dixons Carphone after 2020 could potentially cost Dixons Carphone \u00a3170m of lost earnings before interest and tax or 130p a share on our estimates, but we consider it a tail event distant in the future for which we assign a 10% probability. We do not change our estimates but bring our price target down by 10p to 480p to incorporate this scenario. We reiterate our overweight rating. Oil group Afren\u2019s volatile run continued, as its investors awaited news of a possible bid from Nigeria\u2019s Seplat. Its shares fell 0.74p to 11.10p after rising recently as it secured a month\u2019s grace for $65m of debt payments. AIM listed investment group Yolo Leisure &amp; Technology, whose backers include entrepreneurs Chris Akers (4.7% stake) and Nigel Wray (23% stake), slipped 2.5% to 2.875p after it invested more than \u00a30.5m in London-based live TV streaming business Simplestream in a \u00a32m funding round. Finally Nostra Terra Oil and Gas, which has a growing portfolio of assets in the US, rose 6% to 0.18p after record production in the fourth quarter - more than double the previous three months - and a rise in revenues despite the slump in the oil price.",

European parliament president Martin Schulz (who met Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras earlier) has given an interview with Germany\u2019s Handelsblatt and is taking a pretty hard line (not sure whether the interview came before or after the Tsipras meeting, however): 04-Feb-2015 16:35 - EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT PRESIDENT SCHULZ SAYS IF GREECE UNILATERALLY ENDS ITS AGREEMENTS THE OTHER PARTIES ARE NO LONGER OBLIGED TO KEEP THEIR COMMITMENTS -GERMAN NEWSPAPER HANDELSBLATT 04-Feb-2015 16:36 - EU\u2019S SCHULZ SAYS IN THAT CASE ATHENS WILL NO LONGER RECEIVE FUNDING AND THE STATE WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO FINANCE ITSELF-HANDELSBLATT 04-Feb-2015 16:38 - EU\u2019S SCHULZ SAYS GREEK GOV\u2019T HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO KEEP ITS OBLIGATIONS TO EUROPEAN PARTNERS 04-Feb-2015 16:42 - EU\u2019S SCHULZ SAYS WE CAN FIND WAYS TO GIVE GREEK TREASURY ACCESS TO ASSETS BEING HELD ABROAD IN EU COUNTRIES AND IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAX ACCORDS WITH THE EU 04-Feb-2015 16:44 - EU\u2019S SCHULZ SAYS CAN ONLY TALK ABOUT GIVING GREECE CONCESSIONS IF THE GOV\u2019T FULFILLS ITS COMMITMENTS TO EU PARTNERS (Snaps courtesy Reuters) So, a quick recap of this afternoon\u2019s events. Alexis Tsipras has met with Francois Hollance in Paris, as Greece continues to push for a debt deal. The Greek PM urged France to help Europe\u2019s economy recover, saying: \u201cWe need a new accord in Europe for the return of growth and social cohesion, and in this effort we certainly need France playing a role of guarantor, a protagonist for this political change..... \u201cFrance is a force for stability in Europe, and I think the stability of the European Union requires a change of policy - a determined turn towards growth.\u201d President Hollande offered sympathy to Greece, saying it isn\u2019t tolerable for austerity to be the only option. But he cautioned: \u201cBut there is also respect for European rules, which are imposed on everyone, France too, and it\u2019s not always simple.\u201d The talks followed an earlier meeting between Tsipras and top officials in Brussels, where European Council chief Donald Tusk warned that negotiations will be tough. Our lunchtime summary has all the details. Tomorrow the spotlight will switch to Berlin. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has flown in (after a doze) ready to see Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Earlier, he held \u201cfruitful\u201d talks with the European Central Bank, but there\u2019s still no word from the ECB on whether it will provide more help to Athens. Germany is taking a hard line with Greece, though. A leaked document shows that the German government is pushing Athens to stick to its old austerity programme. The IMF, meanwhile, has confirmed that its European chief met with Varoufakis over the weekend. And Tsipras has made the front page of Private Eye. It was a quieter day on the Athens stock market. The ATG index finished the day up 0.9%, adding to yesterday\u2019s 11% surge. Bank stocks continued to recover - anyone who had the sense to buy shares last week, after they lost a third of their value, has done well. And that\u2019s probably all for today -- unless there are any more developments tonight.... All this frenzied negotiating must be exhausting, so it\u2019s good to see that Yanis Varoufakis snatched a brief nap this afternoon. Andreas Kynast, correspondent at German broadcaster ZDF, reported that Varoufakis took Lufthansa Flight 186 from Frankfurt to Berlin, and managed a brief rest en route (we trust no-one disturbed him). Varoufakis has now been collected by the Greek ambassador at Berlin Tegel Airport, ready for his appointment with German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble on Thursday morning. They\u2019re hardly natural soulmates, but Yanis Varoufakis and the Adam Smith Institute are best buddies after the right-wing thingtank threw its weight behind a Greek debt deal. Varoufakis tweeted his thanks a little while ago: Some afternoon reading... Open Europe analyst Vincenzo Scarpetta argues today that Greece still faces some crucial unanswered questions about its strategy to escape its debt trap: Will other Eurozone countries and the IMF agree to the bond swap? It will mostly depend on how the mechanism envisaged by Varoufakis works in practice. If, for instance, the repayment of the new bonds is linked to nominal GDP growth and the targets are too ambitious \u2013 especially since Greece is currently in a deflation \u2013 would creditors see it as a write-down in all but name?+ Will SYRIZA stick to its guns and refuse to extend Greece\u2019s bailout programme? It\u2019s too early to tell, but this is a fundamental point \u2013 especially since the ECB has said it would cut off liquidity to Greek banks unless the Greek government agrees to extend the programme, with all the conditions attached, beyond the 28 February deadline. While Sony Kapoor of ReDefine reckons we should cut Syriza some slack: Despite several unsubstantiated rumours and sometimes deliberate, attempts to discredit a popular new government, Syriza has done a fairly decent job despite having no previous experience of governing whatsoever. It has not stepped on any nuclear mines, nor done irreparable harm to either its domestic or international standing. Yes it has had a somewhat rocky start but that was to be expected in such turbulent times and stressed conditions. Syriza has done the Eurozone a great service by finally forcing it to start a debate on a number of critical issues that Frau Merkel, dubbed by the Economist as the West\u2019s \u201cgreatest ditherer\u201d, has so far declined to discuss..... Tsipras also insists that Greece\u2019s debt burden must be made \u2018viable\u2019. No questions from the press, though. Alexis Tsipras and Francois Hollande are holding a press conference now: Tsipras is repeating some of the point he\u2019s made in earlier meetings -- that Greece needs growth, not austerity, and that he wants a deal that helps all of Europe. My government is an opportunity for Europe to move forwards, not a threat, he insists. GREECE\u2019S TSIPRAS, AFTER TALKS IN PARIS WITH HOLLANDE, SAYS CHANGE OF POLICY TOWARDS GROWTH IS NEEDED FOR STABILITY OF EU TSIPRAS SAYS FRANCE MUST PLAY KEY ROLE IN THIS CHANGE OF POLICY TSIPRAS - NEW GREEK GOVT IS NOT A THREAT TO EUROPE, IS AN OPPORTUNITY TSIPRAS - WE HAVE MADE \u201cREALISTIC\u201d PROPOSALS THAT CAN LEAD TO AN AGREEMENT Hollande is also speaking, expressing sympathy with Greece but also talking about sticking to the rules. Alexis Tsipras headed off to Paris after his talks in Brussels, to see fellow left-winger Francois Hollande. On a lighter note, Ladbrokes are now taking bets on whether Greece\u2019s prime minister is spotted wearing a tie in 2015. They reckon it\u2019s unlikely. You can get 6/4 that Alexis Tsipras smartens up, and only 1/2 that he doesn\u2019t. Remember, the official line is that Tsipras will only wear a tie once he\u2019s secured a debt deal. A confidential document has dropped into Reuters\u2019 clutches, showing that Germany is refusing to accept Alexis Tsipras\u2019s demands. The document was drawn up ready for a meeting of senior eurozone finance officials on Thursday. It outlines that Berlin will not tolerate any \u2018rolling back\u2019 of the existing austerity, despite Syriza\u2019s victory in last month\u2019s general election. Reuters says: The German document stressed that Athens must not roll back any of the cutbacks and reforms made so far in Greece\u2019s efforts to improve bloated public finances and regain market trust..... \u201cThe Eurogroup needs a clear and front-loaded commitment by Greece to ensure full implementation of key reform measures necessary to keep the programme on track,\u201d the German document said, referring to euro zone finance ministers. \u201cThe aim is the perpetuation of the agreed reform agenda (no roll back of measures), covering major areas as the revenue administration, taxation, public financial management, privatisation, public administration, health care, pensions, social welfare, education and the fight against corruption.\u201d The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel has confirmed that Greece\u2019s finance minister had a chat with International Monetary Fund heavy-hitter Poul Thomsen over the weekend. The Greek finance ministry has now confirmed the meeting. Poul Thomsen used to head the Troika\u2019s delegation to Greece, before being recently promoted to run the Fund\u2019s European division. Alexis Tsipras has received the seal of disapproval from satirical rag Private Eye: Available at all good newsagents. The two men leading the battle to renegotiate Greece\u2019s debts have claimed some success after a round of crunch meetings today. Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s finance minister, says he had \u201cfruitful\u201d conversations with European Central Bank president Mario Draghi. He told reporters that: \u201cThe ECB is the central bank of Greece ... The ECB will do whatever it takes to support the member states in the euro zone.\u201d \u201cI have no doubt that we can conclude our discussions with our European partners, as well as with the IMF and the ECB, in a very short space of time so that we can kick-start the Greek economy.\u201d But there\u2019s no official response from the ECB yet, which is under pressure from Athens to give it permission to borrow more money while negotiations take place. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras also pressed the flesh in Brussels today, meeting European Commission chief Juncker, Council president Donald Tusk and Parliament head Martin Schultz. After being led away by the hand by Juncker, Tsipras reappeared to declare that he will respect his voters wishes and the framework of the EU: I am very optimistic that these discussions that were in a good way - of course we don\u2019t have already an agreement - but were in a good direction to find a viable agreement.\u201d However, Tusk was more cautious, saying after the meeting that negotations would be difficult. And Angela Merkel has denied that Germany is out on a limb on the issue. The chancellor told a news conference in Berlin that there\u2019s no substantial difference of opinion among eurozone members over Greece. Greek bonds have fallen in value, pushing up the yield on the debt, as investors remain cautious about the prospects of a restructuring. After a weak start, the Athens stock market has turned positive and is currently up 2.2%. Bank shares are continuing to recover. Other European markets are down, though. The ECB is due to decide this afternoon whether to continue to allow Greek banks to access funds through its emergency liquidity assistance for another fortnight. Jarno Hartikainen of Finnish newspaper Kauppalehti reckons that Tsipras has been told to stop negotiating through the press... A volley of newsflashes from the German chancellor (and the Maltese PM): MERKEL SAYS WE STICK TO OUR POLICY THAT GREECE SHOULD REMAIN IN THE EURO ZONE BERLIN-MALTA\u2019S PRIME MINISTER MUSCAT SAYS IS AGAINST A DEBT REDUCTION FOR GREECE BUT OPEN TO DEBATE ON CONDITIONS MERKEL SAYS LOOKS FORWARD TO MEETING TSIPRAS AT EU SUMMIT NEXT WEEK MERKEL SAYS I SEE NO DIFFERENCE \u201cIN SUBSTANCE\u201d WITH OTHER EURO ZONE STATES\u2019 VIEWS ON GREECE Here\u2019s the official statement from European Council chief Donald Tusk, warning of difficult negotiations ahead: I was pleased to welcome Greece\u2019s new Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in Brussels today. Our talks were open and frank on a number of issues of common concern. As regards European financial assistance to Greece, I stressed the need to find a solution acceptable to all Member States involved in the negotiations. Those negotiations will take place in the euro group. They will be difficult, will require cooperation and dialogue as well as determined efforts by Greece. We agreed on the importance of unity within the European Union with regard to other key challenges facing Europe. European Council chief Donald Tusk has warned that talks between Greece and the rest of the eurozone will be \u201cdifficult\u201d, following his meeting with Alexis Tsipras. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s message from Brussels is that Greece can get a debt relief deal with its partners, without shattering the European Union. He sounded optimistic after meeting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Council President Donald Tusk and European Parliament President Martin Schulz. Tsipras said: I\u2019m very optimistic that we will try to do our best in order to find a common, viable and mutually acceptable solution for our common future.... \u201cOur goal is to respect the people\u2019s sovereignty in Greece and the clear mandate of our people. At the same time we respect the rules of the European Union. We want to recorrect this framework, not to smash this framework and we believe that in this framework we could find a common viable solution. \u201cI am very optimistic that these discussions that were in a good way - of course we don\u2019t have already an agreement - but were in a good direction to find a viable agreement.\u201d Heads-up: Greece\u2019s prime minister is giving a press conference in Brussels now. Alexis Tsipras says that Greece doesn\u2019t have a deal yet, but reckons \u201cwe are moving in the right direction\u201d He says \u201cWe have the will to work to find a mutually acceptable compromise with the EU\u201d, and promises to respect European rules. More to follow.... Berlin-based journalist Peter Oliver reckons Varoufakis\u2019s meeting with Wolfgang Schauble tomorrow will be tough. The main Greek stock index has now dropped by 2%, as traders take a more cautious view after yesterday\u2019s 11% surge. Yanis Varoufakis struck an optimistic tone after his meeting with Mario Draghi. The Greek finance minister told reporters shivering outside the ECB headquarters that he believes discussions with international lenders can be concluded quickly. Varoufakis said: \u201cThe ECB is the central bank of Greece ... The ECB will do whatever it takes to support the member states in the euro zone.\u201d \u201cI have no doubt that we can conclude our discussions with our European partners, as well as with the IMF and the ECB, in a very short space of time so that we can kick-start the Greek economy.\u201d (quotes via Reuters) Tomorrow\u2019s meeting with Germany\u2019s finance chief Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble will be a big test, though. The suspicion is that Berlin will want to play a long game with Greece, and see signs of economic reform before loosening the ties of austerity. In other news...China has just eased monetary policy, in the face of its slowing economy. It has cut the reserve requirements on its banks, meaning they have to carry less capital on their books. Sounds like Varoufakis got a warmer reception inside the ECB than the media pack experienced outside: Political scientist Ian Bremmer predicts a long haul.... Greece has just been forced to pay a higher rate of interest, at an auction of short-term debt. The Athens debt office just sold \u20ac812m of 26-week Treasury bills (debt that matures in six months), at a yield (interest rate) of 2.75%, up from 2.3% before. That shows that investors want a higher rate of return for holding Greek bonds. The auction also drew rather fewer bids than usual. This pushed down the bid-to-cover rate to its lowest in eight and a half-years. The Wall Street Journal has confirmed that Greece has started talks with the International Monetary Fund over an extension to its bailout programme: Yanis has left the building.... Yanis Varoufakis also told Draghi that the Greek austerity programme has been driving the country into \u201ca deflationary crisis\u201d. Newsflashes from Frankfurt -- Yanis Varoufakis is telling reporters that he had a \u2018fruitful\u2019 meeting with ECB Mario Draghi. He also said he is \u201ceager\u201d to meet with Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, tomorrow. Britain\u2019s companies have also made a decent start to 2015. Markit\u2019s all-sector PMI, which tracks thousands of UK companies, rose to 56.9 in January, showing faster growth than in December. Good news for eurozone policymakers to ponder -- the region\u2019s service private sector is growing at its fastest rate in six months. Markit\u2019s monthly PMI survey shows that activity in the eurozone picked up pace in January, making a \u201cpositive start\u201d to 2015. But France was the big disappointment; the only member of the Big Four economies not to post growth. Apparently there was laughter in Brussels a few minutes ago as Commission president Juncker led the new Greek PM off by the hand to their meeting. It\u2019s not his first day at school, Jean-Claude! Frankfurt reporters are poised for a sighting of Yanis Varouvakis inside the ECB.... Jim O\u2019Neill, the UK economist who invented the idea of the BRICs economies, is optimistic that the worst of the Greek crisis is over. He\u2019s on Bloomberg TV now, predicting that: Some time in the last week a decision has been taken that Greece is going to stay in the eurozone -- so there\u2019s going to be a deal. That\u2019s his hunch, rather than any inside information. O\u2019Neill argues that it\u2019s \u201cjust stupid\u201d to think that Greece could repay a debt that equals 175% of its GDP. And it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d to imagine that Germany will allow a bank run in Greece, or the break-up of European Monetary Union. Back to Greece....and Yanis Varoufakis has revealed that Athens has opened talks with the IMF over his debt swap proposal. Reuters has the details: Greece has started negotiations with the International Monetary Fund over its plan to swap existing government debt for growth-linked bonds, finance minister Yanis Varoufakis told Italian newspaper La Repubblica in an interview published on Wednesday. Varoufakis also said he was optimistic that the Greek debt problem would be solved and had received good feedback during meetings with financiers in London on Monday. The FT also reports that the meeting between the left-wing economist and City investors at the Four Seasons Hotel on London\u2019s Park Lane went surprisingly well. The investor presentation, organised jointly by Deutsche Bank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, was followed by a series of more informal conversations with small groups of investors. \u201cHe made a real effort,\u201d said one banker. \u201cHe stayed back to talk to investors. That went down well.\u201d More data....and Germany\u2019s service sector has posted pretty decent growth in January, according to Markit: The latest eurozone data paints a mixed picture. Italy\u2019s service sector posted faster growth than expected in January, but France was a little weaker than expected (any reading below 50 = contraction) Just in: a photo of Yanis Varoufakis arriving in his (\u201cslightly rusty\u201d) Mercedes for talks with Mario Draghi, a few minutes ago. It\u2019s all go this morning. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has just shaken hands with Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels. The pair smiled for the cameras, but they look pretty tense... It\u2019s disappointing that Tsipras hasn\u2019t given his new tie a run-out -- clearly he\u2019s saving it until Greece has a debt deal. Yanis Varoufakis has just arrived at the ECB\u2019s headquarters for today\u2019s meeting with Mario Draghi. Bloomberg\u2019s Jeff Black reports that the finance minister has plucked a black shirt from his suitcase today: The Greek stock market has just fallen 1% at the start of trading in Athens, mirroring the decline in bond prices. Not really a surprise \u2013 yesterday the ATG index surged by a remarkable 11%, on optimism over Greece\u2019s debt swap plan. Even though it\u2019s not been agreed by the main powerbrokers in Europe, or even discussed with them... After a storming day yesterday, Greek bonds are weakening a little this morning. That follows the FT\u2019s report overnight that the ECB will play hardball with Athens\u2019 new government. The yield (or interest rate) on Greek 10-year bonds has pushed back over the 10% mark (yields rise when prices fall). The European Central Bank is also deciding today whether to allow Greek banks to tap its ELA liquidity facility for another fortnight. They\u2019ll probably give the green light. But the meeting underlines how precarious Greece\u2019s banks have become, especially as the ECB could block Greece from the ELA if its bailout deal expires on 28 February. Mike Bird has a good explanation on Business Insider: The ECB press office won\u2019t say when the Varoufakis-Draghi meeting is taking place, beyond sometime this morning. They\u2019re not holding a press conference afterwards (alas), so we\u2019ll have to rely on leaks from the two sides afterwards. Greece\u2019s prime minister is also holding an important meeting today. Alexis Tsipras is due to see European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels this morning. Perhaps he could wear that nice tie which Italian PM Mattei Renzi handed over yesterday, to his fellow left-wing leader. Good morning. The master of game theory is taking on the poker-faced saviour of the euro today, as Greece\u2019s battle for a new debt deal reaches Germany. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis will meet with Mario Draghi this morning, in Frankfurt. The former economics professor will be pushing his plan to swap some Greek debt for new bonds linked to growth, to help Greece break its \u201cdebt addiction\u201d. Varoufakis is reluctant to give full detail of his plan, telling reporters in Rome yesterday that: \u201cThis is not the time for financial-engineering lectures\u201d. But he\u2019ll need to play his cards like a pro against Draghi, in perhaps the most serious test of the eurozone since the ECB president pledged to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to protect the single currency. The ECB holds a lot of power over Greece, and it intends to use it. Last night, it emerged that the Bank would block Greece\u2019s application to borrow an extra \u20ac10bn in short-term loans to tide it over. As the FT reported, \u201cThe Greek plan relies fully on the ECB,\u201d said another eurozone official briefed on the talks. \u201cThe ECB will play hardball.\u201d The ECB also has the power to pull the plug on Greece\u2019s banks, by cutting them out of its liquidity programme on 1 March if there isn\u2019t a bailout deal. That would be a nuclear decision \u2013 not one Draghi would take lightly \u2013 but it\u2019s on the table. We\u2019ll be tracking the action in Frankfurt, and other events across the financial markets, the world economy and business through the day....",

It will mostly depend on how the mechanism envisaged by Varoufakis works in practice. If, for instance, the repayment of the new bonds is linked to nominal GDP growth and the targets are too ambitious \u2013 especially since Greece is currently in a deflation \u2013 would creditors see it as a write-down in all but name?<a>+</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li>Will SYRIZA stick to its guns and refuse to extend Greece\u2019s bailout programme? It\u2019s too early to tell, but this is a fundamental point \u2013 especially since the ECB has said it would cut off liquidity to Greek banks unless the Greek government agrees to extend the programme, with all the conditions attached, beyond the 28 February deadline.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LondonerVince/statuses/562961300922572804\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Did SYRIZA just blink and give up on debt write-down demands?

For the UK as a whole, 71% of employed graduates remain close to their home regions for work, according to a report from the Higher Education Careers Services Unit (Hecsu). But there is wide regional variation in what proportion of students from an area take on work there once they graduate and also what proportion stay on to work where they studied. Hecsu captures retention around the UK using figures on first degree graduates from 2012/13 who were employed in the UK six months after graduation. Graduate retention around the UK As the chart shows, Scotland and London also have relatively high retention rates both in terms of graduates originally domiciled in a region, and retention of graduates who were students in a region. Scotland is the leading region for retaining graduates originally domiciled there. Outside London, the north-west retains more domiciled graduates and more students who studied locally than any other English region. The east Midlands has the lowest retention of students of any UK region, with 39.2% of those who studied in the region in employment there six months after graduation. Charlie Ball, head of higher education intelligence at Hecsu, notes two factors in the east Midlands\u2019 relatively low retention rate.

      "bodyText": "Icap, the international money broker run by former Conversative party chairman Michael Spencer, has reacted angrily to a \u20ac14.9m (\u00a311.3m) fine from the European commission for rigging Libor. After a long-running dispute, the commission said it was fining Icap for facilitating several cartels involved in setting benchmark interest rates in the Japanese yen. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the decision to fine Icap \u201csends a strong signal that assisting companies in their cartel activities has severe consequences\u201d. \u201cIt marks the successful completion of our antitrust investigation in the yen interest rate derivatives sector \u2013 but not the end to our efforts to fight anticompetitive practices in financial markets,\u201d she said. But Icap, which is the world\u2019s biggest inter dealer broker and has already been fined by the City regulator and the US authorities, said the decision was wrong in fact and law. \u201cThis is a regulatory matter that has already been settled. It is not a competition issue, and the EC has presented no evidence that Icap facilitated a competition law violation. Icap will be challenging this decision at appeal in the European Courts,\u201d the company said. The commission has already imposed \u20ac669m of fines for Libor rigging on banks including Royal Bank of Scotland and Deutsche Bank which had admitted their involvement in cartels to set yen Libor. Icap refused to settle and the EC said it had found that the broker facilitated six of the seven cartels it had identified. The EC kicked started the formal process against Icap in June 2014 when it issued a statement of objectives, a key step in its investigative procedures. Spencer has already expressed his regret about the role of three of Icap\u2019s former employees in rigging Libor for which it was fined \u00a355m in September 2013. One of them was known as \u201cLord Libor\u201d. At the time, Spencer described up to 10 former and current employes as \u201crotten apples\u201d.",

The IFS said departmental spending will have fallen by 9.5%, or \u00a338.2bn, by the end of next year, instead of the 10.6% reductions pencilled into the chancellor\u2019s \u201cemergency budget\u201d in 2010. \u201cMr Osborne has perhaps not been quite such an austere chancellor as either his own rhetoric or that of his critics might suggest. He deliberately allowed the forecast deficit to rise as growth undershot in the early years of the parliament,\u201d said Paul Johnson, the IFS\u2019s director. However, while the Conservatives go into the general election promising more pain to come, the sharp decline in oil prices means the economic outlook is rosier than for some time. Oxford Economics, the consultancy that co-wrote the Green Budget, expects growth of 3% this year and zero inflation, with consumer spending supported by cheaper energy. Andrew Goodwin, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said: \u201cFor UK households the collapse in the price of oil is the equivalent of a large VAT cut, a pre-election giveaway financed largely by the oil producers. This will provide a significant boost to households\u2019 spending power\u201d. \u201cThe public finances have a long way to go before they finally recover from the effects of the financial crisis,\u201d Johnson said.",

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable has raised the spectre of Europe imposing mandatory quotas on the number of female directors in British boardrooms, as he pushes for Britain\u2019s largest businesses to swiftly appoint more women to senior positions. The business secretary, who has long opposed compulsory quotas for women in the boardroom, made the comments as he lauded the FTSE 100 companies that had made most progress since the launch of Mervyn Davies\u2019s report in 2011. Lord Davies set a target of 25% of FTSE directors to be female by 2015, with the most recent statistics in October putting the score at 22.8%. Cable said: \u201cOur target of 25% women on boards by 2015 is in sight. However, the threat of EU mandatory targets remains a reality if we do not meet it. \u201cIf we are to avoid action from Brussels, we must continue to demonstrate that our voluntary approach is the right one and is working.\u201d In a letter last month to Sir William Cash, chairman of the European select committee, Cable warned that progress on hiring female directors had slowed as he updated the committee on a draft European directive, which currently proposes women filling 40% of non-executive roles and 33% of executive positions by 2020. \u201cIf the directive as currently drafted was agreed, we would almost certainly need to extend or adapt our domestic policy in order to try and reach [targets qualifying the UK for an exemption],\u201d Cable said. \u201cThis is because the scope of the directive as currently drafted covers a wider group of companies than FTSE 100/250, on which UK domestic policy has focused.\u201d Despite the FTSE 100 edging towards Davies\u2019s target, the figures are boosted by the performance of a minority of diverse boardrooms \u2013 with most of Britain\u2019s largest listed companies still failing to hit Davies\u2019s goal. In October six out of 10 of the blue chip index were revealed to have fallen short of the target of women occupying 25% of director roles. The picture among slightly smaller companies listed in the FTSE 250 is significantly worse \u2013 only 17.4% of directors there are female, according to the latest official figures. Davies said: \u201cIn 2011, British business said they could fix this problem on their own, and I am delighted we are now seeing evidence of this, with more women being picked to serve on the boards of Britain\u2019s biggest companies. \u201cHowever, the job is not yet done. Strengthening the executive talent pipeline remains the next and longer-term challenge.\u201d The 10 companies making most progress by percentage point gain since the launch of the Davies report are Old Mutual, Aggreko, GlaxoSmithKline, Wolseley, Land Securities Group, Associated British Foods, Capita, Petrofac, Weir Group and HSBC. Six of those started the process with no women on their boards at all, while neither of the two companies improving by the largest margins \u2013 Old Mutual up 38.5 percentage points and Aggreko up 30 points \u2013 had any female directors at the launch of Davies in 2011. Three firms in the top 10 improvers \u2013 Associated British Foods, Petrofac and Weir Group \u2013 still need extra female directors for the 25% threshold.",
