Goldie's session is not just all about the practical side of meditation. Charts flash up on the wall \u2013 this is Davos after all \u2013 showing lines that could be profit and loss charts, but actually represent brain activity. An academic \u2013 Richard Davidson of the Center for Investigating Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 has a chart showing flu vaccines work better on those who have meditated. And he encourages everyone to give it a go and make it as commonplace as physical exercise became after the 1950s. \"The same thing will happen with mental exercise. You can begin with very small periods of exercise. Start with bite-sized chunks \u2026 We need a massive worldwide media campaign to teach people the fact that wellbeing can be learned,\" Davidson said. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 January 2014 to correct several errors in grammar and spelling.",

The surveys are closely watched because they're a strong&#xa0;indicator of the way the economy is moving.</p> <p>Figures from Germany and the wider eurozone were both surprisingly good though the market has been fretting about a slowdown in Chinese manufacturing reported overnight.</p> <p>The number of Americans making new unemployment benefit claims rose slightly last week but the underlying trend remained positive.</p> <p>Here's an excerpt from Reuters' story:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Initial claims for state unemployment benefits ticked up 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 326,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were revised to show 1,000 fewer applications received than previously reported.<br></p> <p>Economists polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications for jobless benefits to hold steady at 326,000 in the week ended January 18.</p> <p>The four-week average for new claims, considered a better measure of underlying labor market conditions as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,750 to 331,500.</p> <p>Employers added only 74,000 new jobs to their payrolls in December after creating 241,000 positions the prior month.

migration</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Martin Schulz, president of the European parliament, &#xa0;also attended the panel discussion on migration where <a

xenophobia</a>.&#xa0;</b></p> <p>Schulz&#xa0;argued that Europe must recognise that migration, and mobility, is inevitable.</p> <p>It must introduce new rules to handle legal migration, to combat recent tragedies in which hundreds of people have died trying to reach the EU.</p> <p>We need a better, improved, temporary protection for those coming from regions of civil war and natural disaster and what to stay for a limited time and get back, said Schulz.</p> <p>He cited example of Lebanon, where refugees came to Europe during&#xa0;its conflict, and later&#xa0;went back to rebuild the country.</p> <p>The US, Australia, Canada, and&#xa0;New Zealand all&#xa0;have rules for legal migration, said Schulz - saying that America lets people apply to migrate and \"sooner or later, usually later\" they get an answer.</p> <p>&#xa0;Instead, in Europe,&#xa0;\"what we allow is an overwhelming illegal process, when we need a legal process.\"</p> <p>Europe must&#xa0;recognise we are a continent of immigration, and we need a rule, he concluded.</p> <p> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings> <o:AllowPNG/> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso

speech, Reuters has published a poll of economists that chimes with his view that a rate rise is \"some way off\".</p> <p>Two-thirds of the 50-plus economists interviewed thought a rate rise was at least a year away \u2013 even though they expect unemployment to fall to the BoE's stated 7% threshold in the next few months.</p> <p>Reuters conducted the poll after yesterday's news that unemployment had fallen much quicker than the BoE expected to 7.1%.&#xa0;</p> <p>Two-thirds of the economists in the Reuters poll didn't think BoE governor Mark Carney would change the terms of his forward guidance. He has always said the 7% level was not an automatic trigger but some commentators have said he would need to lower the threshold or add wage growth to the equation to hold off a rate rise.</p> <p>Carney gives a speech in Davos tomorrow.

non-executive&#xa0;chairman of Goldman Sachs International, has launched a no-holds-barred attack at Davos&#xa0;on political parties who, he says, deliberately misrepresent the facts about migration.</b></p> <p>Sutherland -- who is also the&#xa0;UN Secretary General's&#xa0;Special Representative&#xa0;for Migration and Development, said some of the views expressed are not compatible with a civilised society.</p> <p> <!--StartFragment-->Speaking on a WEF&#xa0;panel discussion titled \"Immigration, welcome or not?\", <!--EndFragment-->&#xa0;&#xa0;Sutherland said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is already evident that in the European elections there has been a significant rise for parties which I would consider to be advocating xenophobic responses rather than positive responses to migration.</p> <p>I think that this is extremely unfortunate, and I think it is time for the debate to be carried directly to those who advocate these positions.</p>

class=\"block-title\">Eurozone PMI beats forecasts</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Catching up on today's purchasing managers index (PMI) data, <strong>eurozone businesses got off to a much better start this year than expected</strong>. Stronger growth across the region was only let down by a lingering downturn in France, surveys showed.</p> <p>Here's the gist, with some help from Reuters:</p> <p>Markit's Flash Eurozone Composite PMI rose to 53.2 in January, up from 52.1 last month. The result was healthily over the&#xa0;50 mark that shows growth. It was also the highest reading since mid-2011 and beat all the forecasts in a Reuters poll of 25 economists.</p> <p>An earlier composite PMI from&#xa0;France showed activity shrank for the third month running in January. However, the contraction eased from last month and results from services and factories beat expectations.</p> <p>Germany's composite PMI hit a 31-month high. However, weak PMI figures from China overnight have worried the market, helping send the FTSE 100 down almost 15 points to 6811.</p> <p>More Eurozone economic news from Spain with unemployment staying stubbornly above 25% even though the economy has creaked into growth. Here's Bloomberg's take:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Spain\u2019s&#xa0;unemployment&#xa0;remained above 25% for a sixth straight quarter, underpinning the extent of the&#xa0;damage&#xa0;wrought by a six-year slump in the euro region\u2019s fourth-largest economy.</p> <p>The jobless rate was at 26.03% of the workforce in the three months through December compared with 25.98% in the previous quarter, the National Statistics Institute in Madrid&#xa0;said today. Economists expected the rate to remain unchanged, according to the median of seven forecast in a Bloomberg News&#xa0;survey.</p> <p>Over the same period, the economy grew 0.3% from the third quarter, while it contracted 1.2% in 2013 from the previous year, the Bank of Spain said today, confirming the government\u2019s estimate.

Is Iran is getting closer to being accepted by the international community. Do you think it will go the full way? Will we have an accord on nuclear arms by the end of this year?</p> <p>&#xa0;<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><b>Tony Blair (TB): </b>I mean I hope so, but it really depends on whether Iran\u2019s prepared to take a strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons ambitions and step back from being a nuclear threshold state. So I think the previous negotiation gave a space and an opportunity to conclude the real deal but we should not be in any doubt at all,&#xa0;&#xa0;the real deal is that they step back from that threshold because if they don\u2019t, the implications are very serious for the region. Other countries will try an acquire the same capability and then you have even more instability in a region already unstable.</span></p> <p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><b>FL:</b> But how significant is it that the President is here in Davos and looking for business?</span><br></p> <p><b>&#xa0;</b><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><b>TB: </b>Well it\u2019s good that the rhetoric has changed and it\u2019s good that there is a reaching out. I am very happy to give the time and space for the negotiation to succeed but it is very important that we do not mistake the fact that Iran obviously wants to have a full easing of the sanctions, they want to be accepted into the international community. That is absolutely on the table, provided they understand that the price of that is to step back from where they are. That stepping back can be measured in very clear steps so we know what we need to achieve. That is the tough negotiation and it\u2019s the one upon which everything really hangs.</span></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52e0fd1fe4b065f7ddbb837d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-23T11:55:30.870Z\">11.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Standard Bank receives first FCA fine of 2014</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Financial Conduct Authority has doled out its first fine of 2014 - a chunky \u00a37.6m punishment for South Africa's Standard Bank for deficient checks on money laundering.</p> <p>The FCA said between 2007 and 2011 Standard Bank's UK arm didn't carry out proper checks on corporate customers connected to \"politically exposed persons\" - people prominent in politics or high up in public office.</p> <p>The watchdog's account of the bank's failings is pretty scathing:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Standard Bank provided loans and other services to a significant number of corporate customers who emanated from or operated in jurisdictions which have been identified by industry recognised sources as posing a higher risk of money-laundering.</p> <p>Standard Bank identified issues relating to its ability to conduct ongoing reviews of customer files early in the relevant period, but failed to take the necessary steps to resolve the issues.</p> </blockquote> <p>The City has faced long-standing accusations that it is used by foreign dictators and corrupt officials to launder their ill-gotten gains.</p> <p>In 2011 the Financial Services Authority, the FCA's predecessor, published a report into banks' dealings with potentially dubious politicians and public officials that highlighted major failings.

However, on the issue of 'dual use' nuclear systems, he said Iran was not prepared to be discriminated against.</p> <p>Rouhani also expressed confidence that a permanent, comprehensive deal on Iran's nuclear programme could be developed -- unless <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/23/davos-2014-world-economic-forum-day-two-live#block-52e0e22be4b08c5cf389a1ef\"><strong>other parties don't show enough serious will</strong></a>.</p> <p>And despite some probing from WEF founder Klaus Schwab , Rouhani declined to include Israel in the circle of countries which it is keen to build closer ties with.

      "bodyText": "And that's all for today -- big day tomorrow, with David Cameron and George Osborne speaking, along with Shimon Peres, Bill Gates, Al Gore, Wolfgang Schauble, Dilma Rousseff, Haruhiko Kuroda, John Kerry, Mario Draghi, Nouriel Roubini..... Thanks, and goodnight. GW Google boss Eric Schmidt has been telling reporters of his concerns over the US US National Security Agency's data tapping programme - saying that: \ufeff\"The fact that you can do this monitoring does not mean that you should do this monitoring\". Schmidt told the Guardian earlier this week that he didn't know the NSA has tapped Google's data. JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon has risked fresh criticism by declaring at Davos today that the tens of billions of dollars of fines levied on his bank are 'unfair'. Dimon, who has been keeping a low profile at Davos, told CNBC during a TV interview that some of the $20bn worth of legal penalties agreed with the US government weren't really justified, as some related to activities carried out by firms before JP Morgan bought them. \"I think a lot of it was unfair, but I am not going to go into the details,\" Dimon said. JP Morgan's single biggest fine, of $13bn, was paid to settle multiple government claims over dealings in mortgage securities by JPMorgan, and also by Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, which it took over as the financial crisis broke out. Dimon added that he could have fought the cases, but it would have been \"criminal for me to subject our company to those kinds of issues.\" Only in Davos....the Duke of York is tweeting about the importance of fighting inequality. Not immediately clear where the hereditary monarchy fits into this.... Missed these earlier -- just a small example of the interest in Hassan Rouhani's speech today. Enda Kenny, Irish prime minister, looked in good spirits when I waylaid him a little while ago in the conference centre. This is his first Davos since Ireland left its bailout programme. And with Moody's raising its credit rating to investment grade earlier this month, Kenny has good reason to feel cheerier as he mingles with other leaders and business leaders. \"We've had three very tough budgets\", he reminds me, saying Ireland needed a plan with clarity, and the courage and conviction to implement it. \"Now we're seen the back of the bailout, the Troika are gone.\" Kenny also doesn't expect to see a big surge of support for Irish eurosceptic candidates in May's European elections, as looks likely in other countries. The Irish people know the importance of Europe, having voted on it so many times - including twice on the Lisbon treaty, he points out. Davos may be taking the attention but it was China influencing the markets today. News that a manufacturing survey from the country had disappointed was initially taken phlegmatically by investors. That was, until Wall Street woke up and decided it did not like the idea of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. So with the Dow dipping - down 175 points or 1% by the time European markets closed - it was the excuse to take some profits. The final scores on the doors: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 53.05 points or 0.78% lower at 6773.28 \u2022 Germany's Dax dropped 0.92% to 9631.04 \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.02% down at 4280.96 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is down 0.72% at 19,814.55 \u2022 Spain's Ibex is off 0.37% at 10,241.2 Davis Cameron, who gives his speech to Davos tomorrow morning, has given interviews to the BBC and ITV on the UK economy. They'll be broadcast tonight. On a more serious note, Nick Clegg also spoke about the dangers of bilateral trade deals -- he'd rather see more multinational deals to help weaker countries compete with the strong. A light-hearted moment, as the debate about China involving Nick Clegg and Lloyd Blankfein turns to the lack of hotel rooms in Davos. Chinese business man Wang Jianlin who says he didn't want to come back to WEF this year because it's a \"pain\". \"You pay a lot of money to sleep in a thin bed\". It is so bad his Wanda Group - which has invested \u00a31bn in the UK recently - might build a 5 star hotel in the alpine resort. Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary has been lobbying Europe's trade commissioner, Karel de Gucht, about the terms of the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). She tells us unions are concerned that the deal would give multi-national corporations the right to bypass the courts and challenge governments if they thought decisions by the state interfered with their ability to do business. O'Grady said she was pleased that Brussels had bowed to criticism and put the proposal out to public consultation. She warned that as currently planned, TTIP would allow American companies to challenge any attempts to reverse privatisation of parts of the NHS. \"The very threat that US health multi-nationals would use this mechanism would tie the hands of a new government in following through the changes which we want to see.\" She added: \"We are not anti-trade or anti-growth but this can't be a free for all for business at the expense of workers or pubic services.\" IMF chief Christine Lagarde tweets that she hopes to discuss \"gender driven growth\" during her time at Davos. That fits with Japan PM Shinzo Abe's pledge last night to get more women into the Japanese economy. Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu was not impressed by Iranian president Hassan Rouhani's speech this morning -- Netanyahu told the WEF in his own special address that these were a \u201cchange in words and unchanging deeds\". Arab countries, the Israeli PM said: understand that Iran remains aggressive, supports terror, that it participates in the slaughter in Syria, that it is pursuing the development of ballistic missile and plutonium for nuclear weapons. Asked about the peace talks, Netanyahu added that central Arab governments saw Israel as a partner in pushing back threats from the arming of Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood. There was more support a \u201creasoned solution\u201d to Israel and Palestanians than before. (That's via Jill Treanor) Guy Ryder, the director-general of the International Labour Organisation said a lot of people in Davos were stressing the need to tackle inequality but were at the same time pursuing policies that were likely to make the problem worse. Ryder told Larry Elliott: \ufeffThe IMF has been expressing strong concern about inequality but how do the the IMF's own policies impact on growth or reduce unemployment? Ryder said the ILO was in favour of moves that would reduce inequality such as job creation, collective bargaining and increasing minimum wages. However, the strategy followed by the so-called troika of the IMF, the EU and the ECB in the bailed-out countries of Europe is starkly different. Collective bargaining coverage had been reduced by 80% in Portugal and almost dismantled in Greece. Minimum wages have been cut, said Ryder, asking: Is this the answer? Is this the sort of situation people think will be for the long-term good of the economy or society more generally? The ILO and the IMF established a joint agenda to reduce unemployment and tackle inequality in 2010, but admitted the initiative had lost momentum. Ryder says he wants to strengthen the relationship. \ufeffI want to engage with the IMF and talk over some of these important issues. I would like to put momentum back into the relationship.\" US factory output growth has hit a three-month low because of disruption from January's freezing weather, the Markit Flash purchasing manager index showed. But the index still registered growth for January and was slightly higher than last year's monthly average. It's the first indicator of national economic trends for 2014 in the world's biggest economy and follows steady US jobs data also released today. Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit, said: The flash PMI indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow at the start of 2014, and that the underlying trend most likely remained reassuringly robust. After allowing for companies that saw production and sales disrupted by the cold weather, the rate of growth of output and orders remained as strong, if not stronger, than seen late last year. The US numbers add to a pretty positive day on the PMI front. The surveys are closely watched because they're a strong indicator of the way the economy is moving. Figures from Germany and the wider eurozone were both surprisingly good though the market has been fretting about a slowdown in Chinese manufacturing reported overnight. The number of Americans making new unemployment benefit claims rose slightly last week but the underlying trend remained positive. Here's an excerpt from Reuters' story: Initial claims for state unemployment benefits ticked up 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 326,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were revised to show 1,000 fewer applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications for jobless benefits to hold steady at 326,000 in the week ended January 18. The four-week average for new claims, considered a better measure of underlying labor market conditions as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,750 to 331,500. Employers added only 74,000 new jobs to their payrolls in December after creating 241,000 positions the prior month. That was at odds with other employment indicators that suggested a brisk pace of hiring in December. Economists have dismissed the sharp step-back in job growth as a fluke, noting that a cold snap during the month weighed on construction, transportation and utilities payrolls. SF A game of 'spot Bob Diamond' is underway at Davos, with the former Barclays CEO looking on good form, 18 months after being toppled by the Libor scandal. Brazil's finance minister Guido Mantega has predicted that America's recovery will mean some short-term pain for emerging economies such as his own, but in the medium term Brazilian firms should benefit. Speaking at a press conference here in Davos, Mantega said that the \"strong recovery of the US is important\", but it is still at its first step. It will mean an \"immediate\" negative impact on developing countries because of the withdrawal of stimulus measures from the US Federal Reserve (which has helped to push capital into the developing world). But in the future, Brazilian companies should benefit as US firms will have increased demand for their products and resources. \ufeffSo on the middle-term, I would say this [the US recovery] is a positive outlook. Mantega also pointed out that Brazil came fourth on a survey asking CEOs which companies they were most interested in investing in (despite unpopular tax changes and missed growth targets on Mantega's watch). Mantega said fighting inflation would remain a top priority for Brazil's government, but declined to say whether Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, will announce changes to Brazil's fiscal targets tomorrow (as is rumoured). She is due at Davos tomorrow to try to reassure investors. As Reuters explained last week: \ufeffPresidential aides said Rousseff decided it was time for a personal visit to Davos so she could show investors Brazil wants their business, explaining private concessions her government is granting to build roads, railways, airports and other badly needed infrastructure. Sir Win Bischoff is going to be the chairman of the Financial Reporting Council. Bischoff, who steps down as Lloyds chairman in early April, will start at the audit and corporate reporting watchdog on 1 May. He will be almost 73 when he takes over from Baroness Hogg and will expect a quieter life at the FRC than at Lloyds. He'll earn a reported \u00a3120,000 a year for two days' work a week. Bischoff was this week criticised by Lord Levene, who said he handed Bischoff a memo outlining the dangers of the Co-op Bank's bid for more than 600 Lloyds branches long before the deal collapsed. Bischoff had said he couldn't remember the document. The FRC has been pretty busy lately. Today it told auditors to pay more attention to the risk of fraud when companies state their accounts and to check they are complying with regulations. It told auditors to exercise \"greater professional scepticism\" too. SF Improving economic news means another bad year for gold. Prices are expected to fall 13% this year, according to a report by Thomson Reuters GFMS. Gold plunged 28% last year as investors dropped gold-based investments and Indian import controls constrained demand there. The gold price surged to a record in 2011, as investors worried about the eurozone and the prospect of rampant inflation caused by loose US monetary policy. The price crashed last year as both those fears receded. The report said gold would probably not hit last year's low of $1,180 an ounce in 2014 because physical demand from China would take hold if the price hits about $1,200. Andrew Leyland, GFMS manager, told Reuters: Tapering [of the US Federal Reserve's bond buying programme] will continue throughout the course of the year and the global economy will tend to get slightly better. There's little reason for the flight to gold you saw at the beginning of the financial crisis to start up again. SF Martin Schulz, president of the European parliament, also attended the panel discussion on migration where Goldman Sachs' Peter Sutherland attacked parties who preach xenophobia. Schulz argued that Europe must recognise that migration, and mobility, is inevitable. It must introduce new rules to handle legal migration, to combat recent tragedies in which hundreds of people have died trying to reach the EU. We need a better, improved, temporary protection for those coming from regions of civil war and natural disaster and what to stay for a limited time and get back, said Schulz. He cited example of Lebanon, where refugees came to Europe during its conflict, and later went back to rebuild the country. The US, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand all have rules for legal migration, said Schulz - saying that America lets people apply to migrate and \"sooner or later, usually later\" they get an answer. Instead, in Europe, \"what we allow is an overwhelming illegal process, when we need a legal process.\" Europe must recognise we are a continent of immigration, and we need a rule, he concluded. Following up on Bank of England ratesetter Paul Fisher's speech, Reuters has published a poll of economists that chimes with his view that a rate rise is \"some way off\". Two-thirds of the 50-plus economists interviewed thought a rate rise was at least a year away \u2013 even though they expect unemployment to fall to the BoE's stated 7% threshold in the next few months. Reuters conducted the poll after yesterday's news that unemployment had fallen much quicker than the BoE expected to 7.1%. Two-thirds of the economists in the Reuters poll didn't think BoE governor Mark Carney would change the terms of his forward guidance. He has always said the 7% level was not an automatic trigger but some commentators have said he would need to lower the threshold or add wage growth to the equation to hold off a rate rise. Carney gives a speech in Davos tomorrow. Maybe he'll say more on the subject then. SF Peter Sutherland, the non-executive chairman of Goldman Sachs International, has launched a no-holds-barred attack at Davos on political parties who, he says, deliberately misrepresent the facts about migration. Sutherland -- who is also the UN Secretary General's Special Representative for Migration and Development, said some of the views expressed are not compatible with a civilised society. Speaking on a WEF panel discussion titled \"Immigration, welcome or not?\", Sutherland said: It is already evident that in the European elections there has been a significant rise for parties which I would consider to be advocating xenophobic responses rather than positive responses to migration. I think that this is extremely unfortunate, and I think it is time for the debate to be carried directly to those who advocate these positions. Sutherland cited UKIP in Britain, the rise of Le Pen in France, and strong support for Austrian parties who oppose migration, adding: \ufeffRight across Europe there is a negative view about migration which not merely contradicts some of the values which many of us associate particularly with the European Union but more generally with civilized society. He also accused migration's opponents of \"grossly\" distorting the impact of migration on societies, insisting: The evidence is overwhelming that migration plays a very positive role in the development of countries. And that migrants generally play a positive, constructive role in economic activity. The perceptions are totally out of line with reality. Catching up on today's purchasing managers index (PMI) data, eurozone businesses got off to a much better start this year than expected. Stronger growth across the region was only let down by a lingering downturn in France, surveys showed. Here's the gist, with some help from Reuters: Markit's Flash Eurozone Composite PMI rose to 53.2 in January, up from 52.1 last month. The result was healthily over the 50 mark that shows growth. It was also the highest reading since mid-2011 and beat all the forecasts in a Reuters poll of 25 economists. An earlier composite PMI from France showed activity shrank for the third month running in January. However, the contraction eased from last month and results from services and factories beat expectations. Germany's composite PMI hit a 31-month high. However, weak PMI figures from China overnight have worried the market, helping send the FTSE 100 down almost 15 points to 6811. More Eurozone economic news from Spain with unemployment staying stubbornly above 25% even though the economy has creaked into growth. Here's Bloomberg's take: Spain\u2019s unemployment remained above 25% for a sixth straight quarter, underpinning the extent of the damage wrought by a six-year slump in the euro region\u2019s fourth-largest economy. The jobless rate was at 26.03% of the workforce in the three months through December compared with 25.98% in the previous quarter, the National Statistics Institute in Madrid said today. Economists expected the rate to remain unchanged, according to the median of seven forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Over the same period, the economy grew 0.3% from the third quarter, while it contracted 1.2% in 2013 from the previous year, the Bank of Spain said today, confirming the government\u2019s estimate. That\u2019s its first two straight quarters of expansion in over two years. SF George Osborne has used a breakfast round table with 30 UK bosses to urge them to put their heads over the parapet and argue the case for British business. The chancellor made his case at a private event organised by the CBI. James Quinn of the Telegraph has the details: Mr Osborne said that chief executives and chairmen need to move beyond the financial crisis era mentality, where many business leaders retreated for fear of negative sentiment, and be more open in telling the success story that is British business. The Chancellor is understood to have said that business was not through the 'denial phase' and should move on to the front foot. Here's his story: George Osborne tells UK business leaders to 'step up' Osborne is due to appear on a panel tomorrow morning with other finance ministers. Here's a different kind of FCA story. Money Marketing reports that the watchdog and its predecessor the Financial Services Authority spent almost \u00a3200,000 on flowers to brighten up the office in the last five years. The story says: A freedom of information request, submitted by Money Marketing, found the FCA and FSA spent a total of \u00a3198,968 between 2009 and 2013 on plants and flowers for its London and Edinburgh offices and for events, at an average cost of \u00a33,316 a month, or \u00a3765 a week. Over the period, it spent \u00a3149,432 on its two London offices, \u00a321,747 on its Edinburgh office and \u00a327,787 on flowers for high profile events. The FSA stopped purchasing flowers for high profile events in August 2012. Between the FCA\u2019s inception on 1 April 2013 and 31 December 2013, it spent a total of \u00a322,004 on flowers, equivalent to \u00a32,444 a month, or \u00a3564 a week. Of this, \u00a318,584 was spent on its London offices and \u00a33,419 on its Edinburgh office. An FCA spokeswoman told Money Marketing the contract for the flowers is value for money. Here's a tweet from one of the mag's reporters: Australian PM Tony Abbott's speech on his priorities for the G20 was slightly overshadowed by Rouhani's address beforehand -- but it contained a call to for more free trade, and tax reform. \ufeff Trade comes first. Every time one person freely trades with another, wealth increases. At the very least, the G20 should renew its resolve to undo any protectionist measures put in place since the crisis.\u201d Former UK prime minister Tony Blair is in Davos, and has welcomed Hassan Rouhani's presence this year too, but warned that Iran needs to 'step back' from the threshold of nuclear weapons capability for a comprehensive deal to be agreed. Here's the details, from an interview with Bloomberg: Francine Lacqua (FL): Talk to me a little bit about the last two weeks which has been huge for the Middle East. Is Iran is getting closer to being accepted by the international community. Do you think it will go the full way? Will we have an accord on nuclear arms by the end of this year? Tony Blair (TB): I mean I hope so, but it really depends on whether Iran\u2019s prepared to take a strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons ambitions and step back from being a nuclear threshold state. So I think the previous negotiation gave a space and an opportunity to conclude the real deal but we should not be in any doubt at all, the real deal is that they step back from that threshold because if they don\u2019t, the implications are very serious for the region. Other countries will try an acquire the same capability and then you have even more instability in a region already unstable. FL: But how significant is it that the President is here in Davos and looking for business? TB: Well it\u2019s good that the rhetoric has changed and it\u2019s good that there is a reaching out. I am very happy to give the time and space for the negotiation to succeed but it is very important that we do not mistake the fact that Iran obviously wants to have a full easing of the sanctions, they want to be accepted into the international community. That is absolutely on the table, provided they understand that the price of that is to step back from where they are. That stepping back can be measured in very clear steps so we know what we need to achieve. That is the tough negotiation and it\u2019s the one upon which everything really hangs. The Financial Conduct Authority has doled out its first fine of 2014 - a chunky \u00a37.6m punishment for South Africa's Standard Bank for deficient checks on money laundering. The FCA said between 2007 and 2011 Standard Bank's UK arm didn't carry out proper checks on corporate customers connected to \"politically exposed persons\" - people prominent in politics or high up in public office. The watchdog's account of the bank's failings is pretty scathing: Standard Bank provided loans and other services to a significant number of corporate customers who emanated from or operated in jurisdictions which have been identified by industry recognised sources as posing a higher risk of money-laundering. Standard Bank identified issues relating to its ability to conduct ongoing reviews of customer files early in the relevant period, but failed to take the necessary steps to resolve the issues. The City has faced long-standing accusations that it is used by foreign dictators and corrupt officials to launder their ill-gotten gains. In 2011 the Financial Services Authority, the FCA's predecessor, published a report into banks' dealings with potentially dubious politicians and public officials that highlighted major failings. At the time the watchdog was surprised how little pickup the report got. The FCA said the fine was the first anti-money laundering penalty under its new tougher regime and the first to punish poor laundering checks in commercial banking. SF Retail sales growth slowed this month, a CBI survey shows. The employer lobby's distributive trades poll for sales came in worse than expected with a balance of +14 compared with analyst expectations for a+25 reading, according to Reuters. Grocers and furniture shops held up well but clothing sales slumped because of the unseasonally mild weather this month. The balance figure for December was +34.The number shows the difference between retailers reporting sales rising and falling. The figures suggest that, after a solid Christmas, the high street is quiet again now normal service has resumed. Retailers expect similarly \"modest\" sales growth next month too. Barry Williams of Asda, who chairs the CBI distributive trades survey panel, said: At a time of year when shoppers are recovering from the excesses of Christmas and watching their spending carefully, it\u2019s encouraging that high street sales have continued to grow. While retailers predict some modest growth ahead, the prospect of continually slow pay growth is likely to mean cautious consumers for some time to come. Here's the pithy verdict of Steve Collins at London &amp; Capital Asset Management: As the first Iranian leader to visit Davos in a decade, Hassan Rouhani's special address was eagerly awaited. And the president did lay out a vision -- telling the World Economic Forum that he hopes to build closer ties with the rest of the world. Describing his approach as one of \"prudent moderation\", Rouhani vowed to unlock Iran's economic potential. At one point in the speech (highlights start here), Rouhani said that Iran has the potential to become one of the world's 10 largest economies within the next three decades, if it could establish normal economic ties and see oil sanctions lifted. An active foreign policy can boost economic development, he argued -- saying the financial crisis had taught that countries cannot lock themselves away. And with a nod to WEF's own theme for Davos, he said that successful economies must also be ethical. Rouhani had travelled to Davos hoping to build relationships with business leaders, and he revealed during his speech that he had held talks with oil firms this morning. Unlock our oil reserves, he argued, and we can generate the activity needed for economic growth, and ultimately for peace. But the political situation in the Middle East loomed over Rouhani. On Syria, he said that \"free and fair elections\" must be held in the crisis-striven country, but also blamed \"ruthless killers flooding into\" Syria. And Rouhani reiterated that Iran's nuclear ambitions are peaceful - pledging that Tehran had no plans for a nuclear weapon. However, on the issue of 'dual use' nuclear systems, he said Iran was not prepared to be discriminated against. Rouhani also expressed confidence that a permanent, comprehensive deal on Iran's nuclear programme could be developed -- unless other parties don't show enough serious will. And despite some probing from WEF founder Klaus Schwab , Rouhani declined to include Israel in the circle of countries which it is keen to build closer ties with. Only \"all countries who we have officially recognised\" form part of his goal for developing Iran's economy. Some forthright language from Peter Sands at Davos. Standard Chartered's boss dismissed talk that his bank might soon be taken over as \"rubbish\". The bank's shares jumped yesterday after the FT suggested potential bidders ranged from Australia's ANZ to Wells Fargo of the US. Here are some snippets from Reuters' report: \"It's speculative rubbish,\" Peter Sands told Reuters Insider television at the World Economic Forum. \"The bank is in very good shape, we have great opportunities in our markets, we have a very clear strategy and we have a great team.\" Sands, who has been chief executive since 2006, also played down talk that he could move to become chairman or that Mike Rees, who was named deputy CEO in this month's reshuffle, is being lined up as a replacement. \"I have no plans to do anything else,\" Sands said, adding that he is \"very happy\" in his job. \"I've made very clear I have no interest in becoming chairman and I've never expressed any desire to do so.\" It's a refreshing change from the standard \"we don't comment on rumour and speculation\" response. From this tweet, it looks like Sands was even more fed up with the subject when CNBC spoke to him: Paul Fisher, a Bank of England ratesetter, has given a speech this morning. Most of it reiterates the guidance in this week's minutes from the recent Monetary Policy Committee meeting: \"no immediate need\" to raise rates if unemployment falls to the 7% threshold, rates will rise gradually when the time comes etc. The main line from Fisher, who is the BoE's director of markets, is this: My own judgement is that we are still some way off the point where it is appropriate to start raising Bank Rate. Aldermore, the specialist small business bank, tweeted to that effect: As my colleague Fiona Walsh has pointed out, the number of women chairing FTSE 100 companies is about to double. Shire, the pharmaceuticals group, has announced that Susan Kilsby will take over from long-serving chairman Matthew Emmens at the end of April. At the moment, Alison Carnwath at Land Securities is the only woman chair in the FTSE 100. There have been two women board leaders in the top 100 companies before. Between 2008 and 2010 Baroness Hogg chairship of 3i overlapped with Carnwath's tenure at Land Securities. Like Carnwath, Kilsby, who is from the US, started off as an investment banker. She's been a non-exec at Shire since 2011. Let's see if she is replaced by another woman. That would give Shire three female directors out of 11, meeting Lord Davies's target of 25% women directors. At the moment, with two women out of 11, Shire falls short. Much chat about Rouhani's speech -- one delegate tells me \"not bad, but he didn't want to recognise Israel\". His comments about Syria didn't impress Huffington Post global news editor Peter Goodman. Now Tony Abbott, Australia's PM, is speaking -- saying that there is more optimism about the state of the global economy. US is growing well, China is moderating but will probably expand at over 7% a year, and even the eurozone is growing again, he says. But the US tapering needs to be handled carefully, and we need to create 30 million extra jobs just to fix the joblessness created since the financial crisis began. A final question for president Rouhani - when you spoke about peace, did you mean peace with all countries? A reference to Israel, whose PM is speaking this afternoon. Rouhani replies: All those who we have recognised inside this circle. We have had certain differences with certain countries... but we want to see a better future, and peace with all. (There is scattered applause.) Let me pick up on that last word, presses Klaus Schwab. All the world? Yes, all countries.. that we have officially recognised, Rouhani replies, smiling. That's the end of the session- Rouhani gets a decent round of applause again, despite ducking that last question. The issue of Iran's recognition of Israel is a hot topic at WEF - over the weekend, Benjamin Netanyahu said he might meet with Rouhani in Davos if Iran was prepared to recognise Israel. Now a question about Syria - what will you do to stop this tragedy, soon? Syria has been engulfed in a serious catastrophe, Rouhani says. Millions of innocent people have been killed, injured or made homeless. This cold winter ads to the misery. It is a miserable situation and very sad. Ruthless killers are flooding into Syria, he says, and fight - even fight each other. We should all work together to help Syria, and push these killers out of Syria. Then we must get the opposition around the table, and organise full and fair elections in Syria. A lot of humanitarian aid is being sent into Syria. Everyone should help the Syrians, to help them reach free and fair elections, Rouhani concludes. What about concerns about dual-use of nuclear technology? 40 countries have dual-use of nuclear technology, Rouhani replies - Iran will not accept being discriminated again. On to questions -and Klaus Schwab asks president Rouhani what obstacles stand in the way of a comprehensive nuclear deal with Iran. Rouhani says he does not see any insurmountable hurdles. We have no ambition to create a nuclear weapon. But Iranian people are not prepared to give up their peaceful technology. We will continue to develop peaceful nuclear use. There could be a lack of serious will from other parties, he suggests. This is a long, difficult road, but if we push hard we can reach a comprehensive deal that will benefit us all, he concludes. President Rouhani sums up by saying he wants to engage with the world community. He gets a respectful round of applause from the room. Onto the issue of oil, and Rouhani says he met with the bosses of major oil firms this morning to discuss how the energy resource of the Islamic Republic of Iran could be used in a \"framework of mutual interests\". Energy can be a key factor in promising peace, he adds. We will contribute to globalisation through the implementation of universal ethics, pledges Rouhani. I believe in engaging with the world community in a fair basis. On the recent nuclear deal agreed between Iran and major powers, Rouhani insists that: What we have agreed is not a temporary position, but a prelude to a lasting resolution. I strongly declare that nuclear weapons have no place in our security strategy, declares the Iranian president. We have no plans in that direction, Rouhani adds. The security of the Middle East cannot be achieved by ignoring its people - we must create hope among its young people. And if we want everyone to contribute to security, everyone must feel secure. If some actors are excluded from the world community for some reason, everyone will suffer. It is important that all countries are involved. Now Rouhani tells Davos that sanctions \"merely exacerbate\" instability, rather than creating peace. Onto geopolitics, and Rouhani says that he comes from a region that is currently, unfortunately, in flames. On terrorism, he calls it a fire that will engulf those who commit it. The key to fighting terrorism is economic development. On trade, Rouhani says he aims to build stronger trade links with its neighbours - reeling off a list including Russia and Turkey - and to achieve normalised relations with Europe (updated). The key to peace in the Middle East is to achieve economic growth, Rouhani says. And he also warns delegates that \"Economics without ethics\" will cause major damage to humanity in the long run. Rouhani is telling WEF that his goal is to build closer ties with the rest of the world. We will use active foreign policy to boost economic development. Let me be clear, says Rouhani: I see Iran's economy as the most congruent, capable, and most close to successful economies, and I see its place alongside them in future. I was elected with a magnate to persuade economic development, democracy. The Koran has taught us that only those systems which serve the people will survive, explains Rouhani. That chimes strongly with the message which the pope sent to Davos. The last six years have taught us that no country can succeed alone. No country can regard its dominance as permanent. And we are all linked through globalisation. If we do not choose wise captains then the storm will claim us all, Rouhani said. Now, Iranians are rightfully demanding the implementation of this vision of prudence and hope, Rouhani says. My view is one of prudent moderation - based on Islam. That is why I entered Iranian politics. It is the secret to Iran's success through history. Rouhani says he's pleased to be here -believes the WEF can help improve the world's management. I am here to convey my people's message of friendship, peace, and co-operation. The world needs to hear Rouhani's long-term vision for Iran, Schwab adds. Gosh it's tense in here! Klaus Schwab, founder of WEF, is introducing president Rouhani now. He says compromises will be needed from all sides to improve the situation in the Middle East at this time of enormous change. Excitement in building in Davos as Hassan Rouhani's special address is about to begin, in about 10 minutes time. It's being streamed live here . It's a big day for purchasing manager indexes (PMIs), which measure activity at private sector companies. Overnight, HSBC's Chinese PMI showed the country's manufacturing sector contracting. Here's some of AP's report: The preliminary version of HSBC's purchasing managers' index dipped to 49.6 this month from December's 50.5 reading. It's the lowest reading since July's 47.7. The index is based on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 indicate expansion. The report on China's massive manufacturing industry adds to recent signs that the world's second-biggest economy is decelerating, adding to pressure on China's communist leaders who want to bring in sweeping reforms while keeping growth ticking along. We've also had Germany's PMI figures, which came in better than expected. Here's a tweet from CMC's Michael Hewson. Later this morning we'll get the CBI's distributive trades survey for the UK. Bono is in town. The U2 singer's campaign organisation One is trying to ensure that Western extractives companies (such as oil firms) are transparent in their dealings with developing countries. The idea is to root out corruption, he explained to Larry Elliott. Bono said he thought talks with Japan's PM Shinzo Abe went well but is less happy with how things has been going in the US where there has been major push back by the energy sector against new legislation. He fumed: \"The API [American Petroleum Institute] has sued the SEC and won.\" He's right - last September a US court blocked a rule requiring mining companies to disclose payments they make to US and foreign governments. Sir Roger Carr, one of Britain's most experienced businessmen, has also touched on the fears over conflict breaking out between China and Japan (see earlier post). Carr, recently named as chairman of BAE Systems, warned that the World Economic Forum does not have a great forecasting record. He told Bloomberg TV: I think you look back and you see that very often the topics we thought of that time to be critical are not a year later when we reflect on. I think where we are at the moment is a position where we have moved from being concerned about crisis to concern about managing recovery and the mindset is different. But I do think your point about the geopolitical risk also starts to be different. And as Iran seems to be moving a little closer to being part of the community, which is good news. Then you look further into the area of Japan and China and some concerns are developing there. Like always with the world it\u2019s never stable. And we have to recognize that. This year, WEF identified wealth inequality and unemployment as key threats to the global economy, arguably several years too late. Sustainability is another big theme at Davos this week, with delegates discussing important issues such as climate change, resource management, and water management. Our colleagues Jo Confino and Caroline Holtum are covering the action in another liveblog here: Davos 2014: climate change, resource security and sustainability \u2013 day two live A running theme of this year's Davos is whether we're facing a repeat of 1914, when leaders didn't realise until too late that the world was heading towards a huge military conflict. Japanese PM Shinzo Abe put the issue firmly on the agenda last night - sending a shiver through the Congress hall as he warned that military expansion in Asia could run out of control unless checked. Abe's comments are being interpreted as an appeal for support from leaders here in its dispute with China over islands in the East China Sea. Economist Nouriel Roubini tweets that many speakers at Davos are making comparisons with 1914 -- pointing out that then, like today, wealth inequality was high. United Carpets and Floors2go have promised to clean up their acts when it comes to deals they advertise to customers. The Office of Fair Trading said United Carpets has pledged to make sure its advertised recommened retail prices are genuine. The company is also going to be more careful when it claims to hold a sale when a store is \"closing down\" or \"closing for refurbishment\". The OFT announced an inquiry into carpet and furnishings retailers last year because it suspected claims of sales and reductions weren't always genuine. The regulator said United Carpets was no longer part of the investigation. Floors2go owner Nixon &amp; Hope has agreed to change its practices after the OFT found that it was advertising prices online that excluded VAT. The regulator was also unhappy that some claimed savings for customers weren't genuine. Gaucho Rasmussen, the OFT's goods and consumer director, said: When retailers advertise misleading prices or promotions, consumers often make different purchases - or spend more money - than they otherwise might have done. We therefore welcome the changes that United Carpets and Nixon &amp; Hope have made, and agreed to make, to their pricing and marketing strategies. SF Adair Turner went on to warn that the UK has not managed to reshape its economy into a more export-driven one: In the UK from 2009 to early 2013 we kept surprising on the downside. For the last 9 months we have been surprising on the upside. We have spent the last few years talking about the need to rebalance the economy away from a focus on property and financial services and towards investment and exports. We are now back to growth without any rebalancing at all. So, not too impressed with Britain's recent recovery.... If you chuck enough monetary stimulus at an economy something happens. It is as if we have had a cracking great hangover, had a stiff drink and off we go again. In London, Pearson shares have tumbled more than 8% in early trading after the education publisher published a profit warning. Earnings per share after restructuring costs will be lower than the company expected. Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times and the Economist, said it had a tough time last year. In the US, its biggest market, business was affected by tight state education budgets, lower enrolment in higher education and the adoption by most states of common core standards. It suffered problems in the UK, too. Higher restructuring costs will push annual earnings per share after those costs to about 70p, compared with consensus forecasts of about 76p. The statement was published ahead of annual results scheduled for 28 February. The message from the company was that it will cut more costs and increase its efforts in emerging markets, where business is much better. John Fallon, Pearson's chief executive, said: Pearson made good progress on our strategic goals in 2013 but our trading and financial performance has been weaker than expected, particularly in North America. With trading conditions still challenging in 2014, this further underlines the importance of the work we started in 2013 to reduce our established cost base and redirect our investment towards our biggest future growth opportunities. We will accelerate this transformation in 2014 and remain confident about our growth prospects in 2015 and beyond. SF Outside the Davos congress centre, HSBC has been holding a breakfast briefing -- and the threat of deflation was on the menu. From the event, Larry Elliott reports: Stephen King, HSBC chief economist, says there were three big surprises in 2013 - stronger growth in some developed countries such as Japan and Britain, slower growth in some developing countries including Brazil and India and finally much lower than expected inflation. King warned: \"The question is whether low inflation will prevent the recovery being sustained.\" Adair Turner, the former head of the FSA, is also breaking bread with HSBC-- he said low inflation was the result of the overhang of debt and it was a surprise that deflationary fears had not surfaced earlier. Turner says he expects the European Central Bank will resort to further \"exceptional measures\"to counter deflation within the next year. He warned: \"For several decades before the crisis on average annual growth in credit was faster than growth in nominal GDP and leverage went up. Somewhere there is a limit to that and it was reached in 2008. Do we know how to run a capitalist economy where credit growth is line with nominal GDP?\" Many of the sessions are being broadcast live, on WEF's website. Here's details of some of the main events (all times in Davos time, so GMT + 1) 10.10am: Hassan Rouhani's special address on \"Iran in the World\" 10.40am: Australian PM Tony Abbott on Australia's goals for the G20 11am: a debate on Youth unemployment and the challenge faced by millenials 2.15pm: Benjamin Netanyahu 's special address on Israel's economic and political outlook 4.15pm: A debate on the humanitarian crisis in Syria, with Peter Maurer, the president of International Red Cross, UN High Commissioner for RefugeesAntonio Guterres, Baroness Amos, and Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey 6.15pm: Closing Europe's competitiveness gap - a debate including EC president Jose Manuel Barroso, Irish PM Enda Kenny, and Italian PM Enrico Letta. Good morning from Davos, Switzerland, where the second day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. It's a hectic schedule today, with a host of world leaders lined up to address delegates through the day. The highlight of the morning is a special address from Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, followed by Australian PM Tony Abbott. Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu will take to the stage this afternoon. Senior politicians are flocking into the conference rooms -- there was just a brief flurry as Egypt's interim prime minister, Hazem El Beblawi, arrived. There's a lot of attention on the Middle East today -- with a debate on the crisis in Syria coming up too. Economics isn't being neglected either -- Christine Lagarde is expected to speak this afternoon, and US Treasury secretary Jack Lew is in town. And there are scores of other sessions, public and private, across the Swiss ski resort. We'll be tracking all the action though the day, with my colleagues Jill Treanor and Larry Elliott.",

The number of vans built in the UK dropped 27% to just under 70,000 in 2013 according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), as weak demand from Europe and the Southampton closure in July took their toll. Ford, which moved production of the Transit van to Turkey, more than halved its UK van production to around 13,000 vehicles from 28,000 in 2012. Vauxhall remained Britain's biggest van producer at 44,657 vehicles, but that was 16.5% fewer than it built at its Luton plant in 2013, as a poor European market drove volumes down. A 5% rise in the number of lorries made in the UK and a 4% increase in bus and coach manufacturing was not enough to offset the slump in vans, with commercial vehicle production down 21.7% at 87,671 overall last year. Commercial vehicles built for foreign markets fell by 24.8%, while vehicles built for the home market fell 17.7%. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, blamed the sharp fall on difficult economic conditions across Europe, which hit demand for commercial vehicles.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "SSE reignited the simmering row over high energy prices when it said yesterday that it was on course for a substantial increase in profits to more than \u00a31.5bn and re-issued a call for more of its social and environmental burdens to be transferred to the taxpayer. The company, fomerly known as Scottish and Southern Energy, said it expected to announce at its financial year end to 31 March that it has increased profits by 8.8% and will reward shareholders with a higher dividend. SSE also warned that the levels of investment seen in recent years would be reduced and it is reviewing some of its planned windfarm projects after they failed to obtain the government backing expected. The power supplier was the first of the big six to raise its bills \u2013 by an average of over 8% \u2013 in the autumn, blaming green levies, and will be the last to reduce them \u2013 by 3.5% on 24 March \u2013 after ministers partly lifted the costs associated with the Energy Company Obligation (ECO). But Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE which has lost around 250,000 customers over the last nine months, said the government action so far was not enough. \"In the interests of fairness \u2026 there is still more to be done to achieve what we have argued for some time is the fairest, most progressive solution \u2013 which is to shift the full cost burden of environmental and social policies from the energy bill payer to the taxpayer.\" Meanwhile Mark Todd, director of independent price comparison website energyhelpline, argued that SSE had clearly delivered for its shareholders but customers had lost out. \"The only real winners in the current energy market appear to be the big energy suppliers and their shareholders who are making scorching profits as customers struggle to keep warm through this wet and windy winter.\" Caroline Flint MP, Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, said energy companies think they can get away with treating their customers poorly because they know David Cameron will never stand up to them. \"The next Labour government will undertake the biggest overhaul of our energy market since privatisation. Our plans will break up the big energy companies, put an end to their secret deals and make tariffs simpler and fairer. And until these reforms kick in, we will put a stop to unfair price rises by freezing energy bills until 2017, saving the average household \u00a3120.\" Ed Miliband accused SSE of \"ripping off\" its seven million customers when it first announced its 8.2% rise in October and many were surprised that the company was slower than others to respond to ministers lifting the ECO burden. Perth-based SSE supplies retail power under the Southern Electric, Scottish Hydro and Swalec banners and is also one of the power distribution firms which struggled to maintain its networks after heavy storms. About 750,000 properties were affected, and many left without power for days over Christmas by a series of network providers. Earlier this week in a review of the way the problems had been handled, Tim Yeo, the chairman of the House of Commons energy select committee, said there seemed to be a lack of any \"expression of real concern\" by firms for those affected. Mark Mathieson, managing director of SSE networks, praised the efforts of staff who turned out to reconnect properties in problems caused by a \"unique\" weather situation. But he admitted the industry had to learn lessons. \"We as an industry clean these events up much quicker than we used to. But we also recognise the impact that has on customers,\" he said. SSE has ramped up its power output from renewable energy sources over the last year but said it was reviewing future investment after its Galloper and Beatrice offshore wind farms failed to be included in a Department of Energy and Climate Change list of provisionally affordable projects. Overall future investment over the next five years is likely to be lower than the \u00a31.5bn to \u00a31.7bn spent annually since 2010. \u2022 See if you can switch energy supplier and save money with the Guardian",

Aviva has begun looking for Regan's replacement but the uncertainty has seen its shares slip 1.2p to 476.1p. But among the mid-caps Kenmare Resources rose 0.96p or 5% to 19.07p. The company, which produces ilmenite, used for paint pigment, from a mine in Mozambique, reported positive production numbers for 2013.",

      "bodyText": "A spell of mild weather at the start of the year hit clothes shops and kept the high street's recovery in check, according to industry figures. The CBI's monthly distributive trades survey found that sales grew modestly in the first two weeks of January after steady growth recorded by furniture and carpets retailers in tandem with higher demand for groceries was undermined by a tumble in demand for winter woollies. The CBI said fortunes were mixed across the different sectors after clothing retailers were badly affected by unseasonably mild weather. Barry Williams, Asda chief merchandising officer for food, and chairman of the CBI retail Panel, said: \"At a time of year when shoppers are recovering from the excesses of Christmas and watching their spending carefully, it's encouraging that high street sales have continued to grow. \"Grocers outperformed relative to other retail sectors, and online shopping growth has remained steady.\" But he warned that the continuing squeeze on living standards while wage rises are running at half the level of inflation would squeeze family budgets. \"While retailers predict some modest growth ahead, the prospect of continually slow pay growth is likely to mean cautious consumers for some time to come,\" he said. The survey found that 33% of retailers reported sales were up on a year ago while 19% said they fell, giving a balance of +14%. There is optimism about the coming year, with 32% expecting sales to grow next month while 17% expect them to decrease. Grocers were the most buoyant with a positive balance of +50% followed by furniture &amp; carpet retailers at +44%. But this strong sales performance was not matched by clothing and footwear &amp; leather retailers, reported declines of -55% and -14%) respectively. Firms selling over the internet continue to race ahead of their high street rivals with 63% of retailers saying that internet sales volumes were up on a year ago. Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that the survey taking place from 2 to 15 January will have meant a favourable comparison with last year, when heavy snow caused disruption in the early part of the month. \"Moreover, the survey's forward-looking balances also presented a softish picture.

Despite the guidance, analyst Gerald Khoo of Liberum said easyJet's forecast losses were \"lower than the \u00a3110m we had assumed\".",

      "bodyText": "A leading Bank of England policymaker warned on Thursday that a rise in interest rates risked undermining th erecovery and the cost of credit should remain low until living standards begin to rise. Paul Fisher, a member of the central bank's monetary policy committee (MPC), joined Threadneedle Street's verbal offensive to protect low rates after official figures revealed a dramatic fall in the unemployment rate to 7.1% in November. Fisher said the central bank was likely to keep rates low despite unemployment nearing a threshold of 7% because unemployment was still \"elevated\". The BoE introduced a policy of forward guidance last year that tied a review of its interest rate policy to a fall in unemployment to 7%. At the time unemployment was 7.8% of the workforce and officials expected the target to be reached in 2016. Analysts now expect unemployment to fall to 7% in the next few months and there is considerable pressure from the City and pension savers for a hike to boost returns. Speaking only a day after his colleague Ian McCafferty highlighted the risks of increasing rates while the recovery remained fragile, Fisher said it was crucial that policymakers saw a sustained recovery before raising rates. He said: \"Even if the 7% unemployment rate threshold were to be reached in the near future, I see no immediate need for a tightening of policy.

      "bodyText": "The former head of the Financial Service Authority, Lord Turner, has compared Britain's rapidly recovering economy with the \"hair of the dog\" treatment for a hangover. Speaking in Davos, Turner said the UK was responding to a cocktail of economic stimulus in the past five years \u2013 low interest rates, quantitative easing, and special government schemes to promote bank lending and mortgage borrowing. \"If you chuck enough monetary stimulus at an economy something happens. It is as if we have had a cracking great hangover, had a stiff drink and off we go again.\" Turner, who was on the shortlist to be governor of the Bank of England before Mark Carney was chosen for the job, told an HSBC breakfast that the economy had reverted to its pre-crisis model of growth. \"In the UK from 2009 to early 2013 we kept surprising on the downside. For the last nine months we have been surprising on the upside. \"We have spent the last few years talking about the need to rebalance the economy away from a focus on property and financial services and towards investment and exports. We are now back to growth without any rebalancing at all.\" Stephen King, HSBC's chief economist, said that there had been three surprises in the global economy during 2013: faster-than-expected growth in some developed countries, such as Britain and Japan; slower growth in certain emerging markets such as Brazil and India; and the sharp fall in inflation. Turner said it had taken time for deflationary pressures to become apparent because a number of one-off factors had pushed up the cost of living. But he said the global economy was suffering from a major overhang of debt and was now struggling to find an alternative way of growing. \"For several decades before the crisis on average annual growth in credit was faster than growth in nominal GDP and leverage went up. Somewhere there is a limit to that and it was reached in 2008. Do we know how to run a capitalist economy where credit growth is in line with nominal GDP?\" Turner said economists who had predicted that quantitative easing, money creation by central banks, would lead to 1970s-style inflation had been proved wrong, and predicted that further measures would be needed if anti-deflation measures failed in Japan and Europe drifted closer to deflation. He said further measures might then be necessary, including so-called \"helicopter drops\" of money, where governments never sell back bonds bought under QE and make the increase in the money supply permanent. \"I don't anticipate that in the next decade the Bank of Japan will sell Japanese government bonds (JGBs) back to the market.\" While there were barriers to the European Central Bank adopting full-blown QE for the eurozone, Turner said there were other instruments that could be used and that \"further exceptional measures\" were a real possibility within the next year.",
