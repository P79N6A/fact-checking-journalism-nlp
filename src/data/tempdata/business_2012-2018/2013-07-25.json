      "bodyText": "The archbishop of Canterbury was forced to admit on Thursday that the Church of England holds a more than \u00a31m investment in one of the main financial backers of Wonga, the payday lender the Most Rev Justin Welby had promised to compete \"out of existence\". A spokesman for Lambeth Palace conceded that the Church of England's \u00a35bn pension fund, which has a policy that explicitly bans it from investing in payday lenders, holds an investment in Accel Partners, a US venture capital firm that is one of Wonga's biggest investors. Lambeth Palace said it had been \"unaware\" of the investment which is a \"serious inconsistency\" with its ethical investment policy, and comes after Welby's personal attack on the immorality of Wonga's business model. Accel, which has also invested in Facebook and Spotify, was one of three funds that pumped $22m (\u00a314m) into Wonga in 2009. On Thursday, a spokesman for Lambeth Palace said: \"We will be asking the Assets Committee of the Church Commissioners to investigate how this has occurred and to review the holding in this pooled investment vehicle. \"We will also be requesting the Church Commissions to investigate whether there are any other inconsistencies as normally all investment policies are reviewed by the Ethical Investment Advisory Group (EIAG).\" In its 2012 annual report the Church says its \"new policy on high interest rate lending extends the exclusion on investment in doorstep lending companies to cover companies engaged in payday loans and pawnbroking.\" The news came after Welby had warned Errol Damelin, the founder of Wonga, that: \"We're not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence, we're trying to compete you out of existence.\" In an interview with Total Politics magazine Welby said he was throwing the weight of the Church behind credit unions to offer an alternative to Wonga, which charges an annual interest rate of 5,853%. Welby, who has served on the parliamentary Banking Standards Commission, offered to open up 15,000 churches to existing credit unions and offered volunteers to help run them. Damelin said he welcomed competition from the Church but it is understood that the payday lender is about to launch a national advertising campaign setting out its \"10 commitments\" in a cheeky riposte to Welby. \"The archbishop is clearly an exceptional individual and someone who understands the power of innovation,\" Damelin said. \"There is mutual respect, some differing opinions and a meeting of minds on many big issues. On the competition point, we always welcome fresh approaches that give people a fuller set of alternatives to solve their financial challenges. I'm all for better consumer choice.\" Credit unions, which have an old-fashioned image and something of a chequered financial past, will have their work cut out if they are to challenge Wonga. The lender spent \u00a316m on advertising in 2011 and has a number of high-profile TV and football club sponsorships, including a four-year deal with Newcastle United starting in the 2013/14 season. It has invested heavily in its website, through which it offers borrowers loans of up to \u00a31,000, delivered to their bank accounts in less than 15 minutes. In contrast, membership of credit unions is restricted to interest groups, and several have gone bust in recent months with many citing bad debts as a factor. The payday lending industry has boomed in recent years as stretched consumers have turned to short-term loans to get them through to the next wage packet. While lenders claim they are meeting a need that mainstream lenders do not fulfil, critics say they target vulnerable customers, leading them into a spiral of debt. The entire industry is currently the focus of a Competition Commission investigation, after the Office of Fair Trading found \"deep-rooted\" problems in the sector. Wonga said in March it welcomed any attempt to encourage responsible lending and that it had been \"instrumental\" in helping to raise industry standards. The chief executive of the charity Citizens Advice, Gillian Guy, said other solutions were needed to meet consumers' need for small-scale short-term borrowing. \"Credit unions can be a great option for some people, so it's good news that the Church of England is planning on boosting them,\" she said. \"But at the moment, credit unions can't meet all the demand for short-term credit. We need a responsible short-term credit market that treats its customers fairly, and we want to see banks stepping up and offering short-term micro loans.\" Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, said families were being driven into the hands of lenders by changes to the government's social fund. \"We are calling for local authorities, with government support, to help vulnerable families get access to interest-free, or very-low-cost credit, in a crisis. This will reduce the risk of them being forced to turn to high-cost money.\"",

      "bodyText": "The builder: \u2018Last year was probably our toughest\u2019 Builders have generally had a torrid few years since the economic downturn. The austerity drive and recession meant some big construction projects being shelved, while in many regions housing market activity slumped. David Melling has been in the trade since leaving school 35 years ago. \u201cLast year was probably about our toughest year,\u201d he says. This year is better and his family business, Mason Knight, has been buoyed by its relatively wealthy setting in south Cumbria, he says. But for the sector as a whole, which expanded by a 0.9% in the second quarter, according to official figures , published Thursday, things remain challenging. \u201cIt\u2019s been very, very, quiet. We have been busy enough, we have got enough work, but we have not been inundated. But we have an extension job at the minute and another in September that should keep us busy till Christmas.\u201d While Melling thinks the trade is over the worst, he has noticed a change in the nature of building work. \u201cMore people are staying where they are and extending rather than trying to move.\u201d Customers are more cautious as they grapple with meagre pay rises that fail to keep pace with rising food, fuel and utility costs. \u201cPeople are more careful now. Everything is down to price. Most people are getting three or four prices whereas they used to just say \u2018come and do this\u2019. So people are a bit more careful with their money.\u201d While construction only accounts for 6.8% of the UK economy it has still dragged down growth in recent quarters. It took a 0.1 percentage point off GDP growth in the first quarter of this year, having knocked a 0.6 percentage point off in 2012 as a whole. The latest surveys of construction companies have been relatively upbeat, with signs the government\u2019s controversial plans to boost the housing market are reviving activity. The reports echo the comments from housebuilders such as Barratt Developments and Bovis Homes that trading picked up after the government announced plans in the budget to help struggling house buyers. The private investigator: \u2018We have pretty much ridden the storm\u2019 For Matt Thomas, a private investigator, business is strong. \u201cWe have pretty much ridden the downturn. We do get ups and downs but you find if people have problems, whether personal or business problems, they want it sorted out sooner rather than later.\u201d The London-based private detective agency North Court Investigations does jobs for a range of clients \u2013 from individuals tracking long-lost relatives to large companies checking up on staff, including those on long-term sick leave. \u201cWe do surveillance and find they might be playing football at the weekend or something,\u201d explains Thomas. The agency, which has 300 investigators to call on rather than a big full-time team, also does hand-writing analysis, matrimonial investigations and computer forensics, which can determine if former employees are using previous contacts to set up rival businesses. Prices start at \u00a3400 for a simple trace and can rise to \u00a330,000 or more for big business investigations. PIs stand alongside lawyers, recruitment firms and advertisers as part of a wider business-to-business subsector of the economy, which has generally had a pick-up in activity in recent months. According to the data specialist Markit, which compiles the PMI surveys on economic activity, business-to-business was the fastest growing part of Britain\u2019s dominant service sector in the second quarter. With disposable incomes squeezed, Thomas says, private clients are spending less but there is plenty of work from corporate clients, who use North Court as well as big international agencies like Kroll for extra checks ahead of deals. \u201cIt is probably easier to get money out of bigger companies,\u201d says Thomas. Beyond business clients, there has also been an improvement \u2013 in the south of the UK, he says. \u201cPeople do have a little bit more disposable cash. We class ourselves as more of a luxury service. I do think people are more keen to put their hand in their pocket \u2026 London is doing best, Oxford is doing well, Cardiff not too badly \u2013 there has been a big decline in Leeds and Manchester.\u201d While other UK businesses have been hit by the general economic slump over recent years, there has been one big cultural change that has buoyed private investigators, he adds. \u201cIn the last five years, since the start of the turn down in the economic crisis, more people are having online relationships.\u201d So say you meet a guy in the US \u2026 and after six months you want to meet, you ask us to check his background. One of the most popular things for us is to do background checks.\u201d",

GDP growth is strong by western standards (the economy raced to 1.6% in the first three months of the year), but the need for foreign investment has kept the currency inflated hampering domestic exporters. Recently, the opposite has been true. Investment has slowed and the currency fallen.

So is South Africa. All of them are trying to avoid the vortex of pain when social problems triggered by their stuttering economies only goes to make the situation worse. Turkey's problem is a persistent trade deficit funded by investment inflows. GDP growth is strong by western standards (the economy raced to 1.6% in the first three months of the year), but the need for foreign investment has kept the currency inflated hampering domestic exporters. Recently, the opposite has been true. Investment has slowed and the currency fallen. The central bank has intervened in the markets to defend the lira, which hit an all-time low against the US dollar earlier this month, but Turkey's international liquidity ratio is weak and it does not have a sufficient stock of foreign exchange reserves to maintain this strategy for long. Each country is dodging and weaving to overcome its special mix of problems, but in essence they need the world economy to grow at a time when the IMF says in its latest report that the trend is for growth to slow. What happens in China over the next year could prove crucial for their economies and their ability to maintain some semblance of social cohesion.",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron and George Osborne were handed a precious weapon against Labour's attacks on their economic policies on Thursday as it emerged that the recovery picked up pace between April and June. Official figures showed the UK economy expanded by 0.6%, just months after some analysts predicted that the country was about to relapse into a new recession. Mindful of the experience of the onetime Tory chancellor Norman Lamont, who spoke of the \"green shoots of economic spring\", Osborne used careful language about how the economy was now \"on the mend\". But he was quick to claim the credit \u2013 and, in a direct challenge to his Labour shadow, Ed Balls, to insist that people up and down the country will soon share in the feelgood factor. \"Unlike the unbalanced economy before the crisis, we are going to make sure everyone benefits from this recovery,\" he said, after spending Wednesday night visiting shift workers in the Midlands. \"Britain is holding its nerve, we are sticking to our plan, and the British economy is on the mend.\" Balls, speaking from the United States, said stronger growth was \"welcome and long overdue\", but added that weak wage growth and above-target inflation meant living standards were still being squeezed. \"While millionaires have been given a huge tax cut, for everyone else life is getting harder.\" The 0.6% quarterly rate of growth in gross domestic product was twice the pace recorded in the first three months of 2013, and exactly as predicted by economists, after signs of a pickup in retail sales and upbeat readings in business surveys. The chancellor's allies believe the first two consecutive quarters of growth since 2011 \u2013 across most economic sectors \u2013 will raise questions for Balls, who warned in 2010 that Osborne's deficit reduction plan was \"the equivalent of ripping out the foundations of the house just as the hurricane is about to hit\". Matt Hancock, the chancellor's former chief of staff who is now a business minister, told the Guardian: \"The biggest problem for Balls is he said we shouldn't stick to the course and we should borrow more and spend more. But that is exactly what got us into the mess in the first place.\" Labour embarked on a change of tack in fiscal policy last month when Balls said he would have to accept the government's spending plans for 2015-16 outlined by Osborne on 26 June. But Hancock said: \"Their fiscal policy is in a mess. They have lost the argument but kept the policy.\" Balls made careful plans for the GDP announcement in the full knowledge that the chancellor would hail the figures. The shadow chancellor spent the day in Washington where he launched an inclusive growth commission with Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary, which will look at how Britain can achieve US levels of growth at all levels of the economy. The Office for National Statistics said that all sectors of the economy recorded growth in the second quarter of the year. Both industrial production and the key services sector expanded by 0.6%, the ONS said, with construction \u2013 which has been a heavy drag on the economy in recent quarters \u2013 picking up by a healthier than expected 0.9%. Chris Williamson, chief economist at City data provider Markit, said: \"Prospects look good for a continuation of the recovery in the third quarter, with consumers and businesses both helping drive the upturn. There are even signs that exporters will see improved sales, helping drive the long-awaited re-balancing of the economy.\" John Longworth, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said his members had become more optimistic in recent months. \"Firms are feeling upbeat and are capable of expanding. More and more are adopting a 'have a go' attitude when it comes to exporting, which is really encouraging as this will go a long way to driving growth further still.\" The Treasury hopes that with the eurozone crisis in remission, the economy is now poised for a more solid recovery, after almost three years of flatlining. Analysts believe part of the explanation for the UK turnaround has been the chancellor's deliberate attempt to stimulate the housing market through the Funding for Lending scheme, which has brought down the cost of mortgages, and his controversial Help to Buy measures. Help to Buy is providing interest-free loans for buyers of newly built homes, and from January people buying properties worth up to \u00a3600,000 will be offered taxpayer-backed mortgage guarantees. Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotiabank, said: \"Much of the turnaround in the growth outlook has coincided with signs of a marked improvement in the housing market, coupled with better than expected construction data. Both are thanks to the government's Help to Buy scheme.\" But many consumers were dipping into savings to fund their , and the recovery will only be sustained into 2014 if their renewed confidence feeds through to rising wagesThe early indications are that this is merely prompting consumption growth in excess of income growth. spending. \"This can only persist for a finite period \u2013 we cannot borrow growth for ever.\" Richard Lloyd, executive director of the consumer group Which?, said its surveys suggested many people were still struggling. \"Today's confirmation of further growth is welcome but there is still a long way to go before this will be felt by consumers, whose confidence and spending power remains fragile,\" he said. \"Households are increasingly using savings or credit to pay for essentials.\" Despite the upturn, the economy has not recovered the output lost in the deep recession of 2008-09: the ONS said GDP was still 3.3% below its pre-crisis peak. Thursday's relatively firm growth figure will guide the Bank of England's thinking, as it prepares to decide whether to deliver renewed stimulus to the economy in August. The new governor, Mark Carney, favours giving growth an extra fillip through so-called \"forward guidance\", which reassures financial markets and consumers that interest rates will remain low for a prolonged period; but other members of the Bank's monetary policy committee are known to be more sceptical. However, Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, said he believed the monetary policy committee would still want to give the recovery an extra nudge. \"Real wages are falling, firms aren't investing and non-oil exports aren't growing. So the BoE won't take any chances and we still expect more explicit forward guidance next month. Despite moving up a gear, we haven't yet reached escape velocity.\"",

The Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents post office staff, claims the franchise plans will lead to 1,500 job losses and reduced customer service. The Post Office insists there will be no compulsory redundancies among staff who work at the affected branches. Andy Furey, CWU national official, said: \"It's clear that this dispute is growing in both public and political support while the determination of Post Office staff is unwavering. Tens of thousands of customers have signed petitions against closures and a dozen political bodies \u2013 including the Scottish parliament, Greater London Authority and local councils \u2013 have passed motions against the company's proposals. In fact we can't find anyone who is in favour of them.\" Local councils that have voted through motions against the closures include Manchester city council and Hastings borough council. The Post Office, which is state-owned and receives \u00a31.3bn of taxpayer subsidy, has said franchising out branches to retailers is essential to securing the future of the service. Kevin Gilliland, the Post Office's sales director, has said the crown network of the biggest post offices across the country is \"losing \u00a340m a year of public money\" and \"must change the way they operate to ensure long-term viability\". The Post Office is a distinct state-owned company from Royal Mail, which the government is aiming to privatise before the end of the year.",

Sales of leather goods, such as handbags and wallets, rose 9% led by an \"outstanding\" performance in sales of items for men. Growth at Kering's luxury brands helped offset a slump in sales and profits at its Puma sports brand in the second quarter. Underlying profits at the sports division dived by nearly a quarter in the half year but group profits rose 2.9% to \u20ac983m. Kering says it expects strong sales at its luxury labels to continue over the next six months as it opens new stores.",

Britain's biggest drug company said Mark Reilly, who left China for London before the police arrested four of his senior subordinates, has been replaced by Herv\u00e9 Gisserot, the drug company's vice president for Europe.

      "bodyText": "BT has signed up more than half a million households to its sports channels ahead of their launch next week, when the start of the Premier League season kicks off the latest challenge to Sky's dominance of football broadcasting. Incoming BT chief executive Gavin Patterson, who heads the group's retail business, said the company had set its sights on the millions of UK homes that would like to watch sport but cannot afford Sky's high prices. But Patterson said the vast majority of new signings are Sky TV customers who can receive the BT channels free via satellite without giving up their Sky package. Most are already BT broadband customers, who have now been asked to sign 12-month contracts. The telecoms company's decision to give away expensively acquired sports rights is partly designed to stem the loss of broadband and phone customers to Sky and rival budget pay TV service TalkTalk. \"Some of them will take TV from us and some of them will continue to take TV from Sky and we're relaxed about that,\" said Patterson. \"We realise many customers are attached to Sky TV.\" The new viewers have come at a high price. BT has spent \u00a3736m for the right to broadcast 38 Premier League games a season, and a further \u00a340m on setting up and marketing its channels in the most recent financial quarter, the company said on Thursday. BT's pay TV service added just 23,000 homes in the three months to 30 June, a marked seasonal slow down on the 40,000 added in the previous quarter. Since making its debut in pay TV 2007 years ago, BT has acquired just 833,000 paying TV customers. Rival service TalkTalk, which entered the budget end of the pay TV market in earnest nine months ago, added 160,000 customers in its most recent quarter and now boasts 390,000 homes. However, BT has achieved its smallest decline in income in 16 consecutive quarters, analysts at Merrill Lynch said. Revenues fell just over 1% to \u00a34.5bn, buoyed by strong sales of superfast fibre internet connections at a better performance at its global services division. Patterson warned that Virgin Media's cable customers may \"never\" have access to BT's sports content. Virgin carries the Sky sports channels and was able to offer its customers all the Premier League games by carrying ESPN, which shared rights to the matches with Sky before BT won them. Asked whether Virgin would eventually carry the BT Sport channels, Patterson said: \"We are in discussions but it depends how those discussions go. It might never. They may need to consider their choices. It's another reason why customers might chose to switch over from Virgin to BT.\"",

The hard work was done years ago. Livingston's five-year reign has been a masterclass in cost-cutting and cash generation. The most critical part was halting the inherited nose-bleed in the global services division, which runs big IT contracts but delivered a \u00a31.6bn write-down in Livingston's early years. These days global services is an under-appreciated UK success story. It is one reason why even a \u00a3750m three-year punt on Premier League football rightly doesn't scare the shareholders.",

We are optimistic that the current rate of quarterly growth can be maintained through the second half of 2013 and into 2014.

Consequently there is little reason to expect an imminent change in monetary policy by the MPC.

The MPC will also be aware that despite the tailwind to growth from the money supply, significant headwinds remain. Key headwinds include the squeeze on household income from inflation running ahead of earnings, bank balance sheet reduction and the ever present threat of a return of the euro crisis.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51f0f57be4b00069b47bc14b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-25T09:52:59.306Z\">10.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Cameron tweets that today's data shows Britain is moving in the right direction:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/statuses/360319675130851331\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Today&#39;s economic growth figures are encouraging.

      "bodyText": "Time to clock-off for another day. Here's a quick reminder of the key points... \u2022 Britain's economic recovery has picked up pace. Growth in the second quarter of 2013 has been estimated at 0.6%, twice as rapid as in the first three months of this year. The Office for National Statistics reported that every section of the economy grew. However, the UK economy remains 3.3% smaller than before the financial crisis struck in 2008. \u2022 Highlights start at 9.30am. \u2022 Key charts from 10.02am \u2022 City economists were encouraged by the data, with some predicting stronger growth later this year. Business leaders, though, warned that more needs to be done to guarantee the recovery (see 10.30am onwards) \u2022 Chancellor George Osborne said the figures showed Britain is moving in the right direction. See 9.49am for details, and 1.12pm for video \u2022 There are also a few photos of Osborne meeting nightshift workers at 8.50am Elsewhere..... \u00aa The International Monetary Fund warned that more needs to be done to nurse the eurozone back to health and avoid the crisis in the region flaring up again. See 3.03pm onwards. \u2022 Greek MPs have approved legislation that should mean it receives its next aid tranche soon. See 4.25pm \u2022 Spanish unemployment has fallen for the first time in two years. However, the jobless rate shows that more than one in four adults are still out of work, and analysts warned that seasonal factors and migration were behind the change. See 4.58pm. Back tomorrow for more live-blogging action, probably more centred on the eurozone after today's focus on the UK. Until then, thanks and goodnight.... GW Britain's improved economic growth didn't generate much cheer in the City, where shares ended lower - the FTSE 100 dropped 32 points to 6587. More details here: Shire hits new record after update but FTSE 100 fades as rally runs out of steam This morning's drop in Spanish unemployment has been welcomed by politicians and firms, although ministers admit that the jobless rate remain far too high: Spain's unemployment rate fell for the first time in two years and some of the country's biggest firms said on Thursday business was looking up, boosting the government's claim the economy is climbing out of recession. The dip in the jobless figures - to 26.3% in the second quarter from 27.2% in the first - nonetheless highlighted how far the country still needs to travel on the road to full recovery. Economy minister Luis de Guindos called the figures \"totally unacceptable\". More here: Spain's unemployment rate falls While this analysis piece from Open Europe is also worth a read: Let's have a look beyond the (rather encouraging) headline figures on Spanish unemployment It points out that the drop in unemployment can be attributed to seasonal factors, an increase in people dropping out of the labour market, and migration out of the country. Across to Cyprus, and Open Europe flags up that deposits in its banking sector appear to have fallen again last month. Cypriot deposit leakage continued in June It's a slightly confusing picture, due to the ongoing restructuring of the Cypriot banking sector, but as Open Europe explains: Ultimately, money continues to leak out despite the capital controls or people continue to rapidly wind down their savings. Neither presents a pleasant prognosis for the future of the Cypriot economy. As we have said before the real test will come when the capital controls are finally removed, although that does not seem to be on the horizon in the near future. The BBC has a good take on this afternoon's warning from the International Monetary Fund (see 3.03pm onwards): IMF calls for further action to solve eurozone crisis The International Monetary Fund has called for more action to end the crisis in the eurozone. The IMF wants greater progress made on repairing the balance sheets of banks, so that lending can be kick-started While the Daily Telegraph flags up that the IMF also worried that the eurozone could be hit when the US Federal Reserve starts slowing its stimulus package: IMF fears Fed tapering could 'reignite' euro debt crisis The report warned that the onset of a new tightening cycle in the US had already led to major spill-over effects in the eurozone, pushing up bond yields across the board. Early tapering by the Fed \"could lead to additional, and unhelpfu, pro-cyclical increases in borrowing costs within the euro area. This could further complicate the conduct of monetary policy and potentially damage area-wide demand and growth. Financial market stresses could also quickly reignite,\" it said. The Greek parliament has approved an amendment to its legislation bringing in job cuts across the public sector, which paves the way to unlocking its next aid tranche worth \u20ac2.5bn. The move means Greece will hit its target of transferring 4,200 workers into its new labour pool, where they could be forced to accept a new job or be laid off. Greece's lenders had been concerned about certain 'exemptions' which meant some workers were able to avoid being transferred to the pool. Finance ministry insiders had said that this only affected around 80 people, mainly those with university quailfications or disabilities. Kathimerini reports; The legislation passed on Thursday overrides a law passed last week that protects civil servants with postgraduate degrees and those with disabilities or other social needs from being forced into a labor reserve, where they have eight months to find other jobs in the public sector or face dismissal. Eurogroup finance ministers are now expected to approve the bailout payment on Friday. Yesterday, it said Greece had met 21 of the 22 pre-conditions on the aid tranche. Today's vote should complete the set. The IMF also pointed to the eurozone youth jobless crisis in today's assessment of the region, saying that despite recent progress.... growth remains elusive and high unemployment persists, especially among youth. And while politicians such as Francois Hollande are talking positively about Europe's prospects (see 1.06pm), the IMF fears any deterioration in conditions could be serious. The eurozone, it said, has little slack to cope with new problems: Because policy space is limited, public debt ratios are very high (and still rising), and economic slack is already substantial, further negative shocks\u2014domestic or external shocks\u2014could severely impact growth. The eurozone crisis isn't over, and the European Central Bank needs to take fresh action now to prevent the situation deteriorating. That's the key message from the International Monetary Fund this afternoon, as it publishes its latet assessment of the eurozone areas. The IMF predicted that austerity programmes being implemented across the region could wipe betwen 1% and 1.25% off annual growth this year, and recommended countries should slow down. Fiscal adjustment should be paced to avoid an excessive drag on growth. The IMF also called for the ECB to inject more liquidity into the financial system, though massive cheap loans to the banking sector. This would repeat the Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTRO) conducted at the end of 2011 and early 2012, credited with staving off a more severe credit crunch. The IMF said \"additional unconventional monetary support\" could help reverse the current situation where it is harder and more expensive for firms in Southern Europe to borrow than the North. It said: Taking its current approach forward, the ECB should ensure term funding needs for weak but solvent banks through an additional LTRO of sufficient tenor. The eurozone's stronger banks have actually been repaying their existing LTRO loans, which the ECB sees as an encouraging development.... Today's winds of economic optimism haven't reached Greece today, with two economic surveys showing that the country where the eurozone crisis began is still suffering. Greek household disposable income has dropped by an alarming 6.2% year-on-year,, continuing a trend which began three years ago. And Greek bank deposits have begun falling again, as consumers and companies dip into their reserves to keep afloat. Data released by the Greek central bank showed a 0.5% drop in deposit levels to \u20ac162.65bn. Savings levels had been rising since last summer as confidence rose in Greece following the trauma of 2012, but that trend could be reversing.... Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, has been touring the media studios discussing today's growth data. And the decent growth didn't prevent Alexander from taking a pop at the previous government, when asked about the situation on Radio 4's World At One: Here's the quotes: These figures are encouraging. It's good news, not just that there's been growth but in every sector we have seen improvement. But I'd also say we shouldn't get over-excited because this country has got a long way to go to not just to clear the financial mess that we inherited from the previous government but to rebuild our competitiveness and to make sure that we do have the conditions in this country for businesses to thrive. He then scampered to repeat the message on Sky News, where business leaders were warning that the Treasury is failing to encourage and stimulate investment. Alexander said he wasn't aware of a report that the UK languishes in 159th place when countries are ranked by investment as a share of GDP, but would look into it. We're a helpful lot at Guardian Towers, so politely suggest the chief secretary checks out The Economist, who covered it here: Let\u2019s try to catch up with Mali Here's a video clip of George Osborne discussing today's economic growth figures, and Britain's passage \"from rescue to recovery\". The chancellor says he is encouraged that all sectors of the economy grew in the last quarter (details at 9.43am onwards), and repeated the need to rebalance Britain away from the financial sector. The clip also includes footage of Osborne touring factories and M6 motorway improvement work last night. The UK isn't the only place enjoying better economic data this week. Over in Europe, the president of France has declared that the eurozone recession is probably over. Speaking in Slovenia, Francois Hollande said: Indicators published in the last few days look as if we have reason to believe we have overcome the recession, but it is still fragile. Hollande may have been thinking of yesterday's survey of private sector firms in the euro area, which showed growth for the first time in 18 months. He also said there was \"no reason to sound the alarm\" over Slovenia's banks, whose bad loan problems have led to speculation that the country may require a bailout. Hollande is in Slovenia for a meeting of Balkan leaders to discuss integration into the European Union, and unresolved issues from the conflict of the 1990s. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, argues that today's GDP data is \"tinged with disappointment\", as the UK has bounced back more Tiggerishly after previous slumps. Larry writes: Compared to its miserable performance over the past few years, 0.6% growth looks impressive. But in the longer term it is no great shakes. Historically, the economy has grown by around 2.25%-2.5% a year on average, so the second quarter was smack in line with that trend. But after recessions, national output has tended to rise strongly as it makes up for the ground lost during the downturn. Given that the level of GDP is still 3.3% below its previous peak, quarterly growth rates of 1% would be more normal for this stage of the cycle. The year-on-year growth rate of 1.4% is also below par. More here: George Osborne's 0.6% growth is good but unspectacular The news that UK growth is accelerating will \"shape the national conversation\" about the economy, reckons Nick Robinson, the BBC's Politics editor. But with real wages lagging well behind inflation, attention may shift from headline growth to living standards. Robinson writes: There'll be no more talk of dips - double let alone treble - as people speak of recovery and not recession. That will have an impact on political psychology - giving Tory MPs another reason to smile on their sun loungers this summer and allowing George Osborne to believe that he has finally put that \"omnishambles\" Budget behind him. However, Ed Balls and Labour will be quick to remind us that a recovery in one measure of national economic output is not the same as a recovery in living standards. Average real incomes fell by 3% last year and the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies believes they will fall again as wages are squeezed, benefits and tax credits cut and inflation increases. The politics of 'growth versus austerity' will slowly transform into the politics of who will improve 'living standards for all'. Duncan Weldon, the TUC's senior policy officer, makes a similar point: The latest data shows that take-home pay is only up by around 1% year-on-year, while the retail prices index of inflation is running at 3.3%. Britain is finally getting back on its feet, reckons Nida Ali, economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, but issues such as youth unemployment must be addressed. The headline GDP figures were bang in line with expectations, driven by private sector expansion, signalling underlying momentum in the economy. This is very encouraging and qualifies as the right kind of growth that we have been lacking over the past couple of years. Ali predicts that Britain will achieve growth of \"more than 1% this year\". Although the consumer sector will probably play a major role in the recovery, we also expect momentum to build in business investment and exports, which should give way to stronger growth of over 2% in 2014. But with a number of weak areas in the economy, such as high youth unemployment, disappointing wage growth and low productivity, we still have a long way to go. Today's preliminary estimate of 0.6% growth is only the ONS's first stab at calculating GDP in the last quarter, as it's only based on data from April and May. It may well be revised in the weeks ahead, as Ben Chu of the Independent flags up: Plenty of optimism over at the British Chambers of Commerce, which represents UK companies. John Longworth, the BCC's director general, reckons business confidence is rising, with many bosses planning to hire more staff later this year. Firms are feeling upbeat and are capable of expanding. More and more are adopting a \u2018have a go\u2019 attitude when it comes to exporting, which is really encouraging as this will go a long way to driving growth further still. But strong, sustained growth requires efforts from the government too, as businesses need an enterprise-friendly environment for the economic to go from good to great. New and existing exporters need more support to help them diversify into fast-growing markets, and access to finance for dynamic, growing businesses must be made more available. The Institute of Directors predicts that UK growth could pick up pace in the current quarter, but warns that inflation and the eurozone crisis could scupper the recovery. Graeme Leach, the IoD's chief economist, commented: The GDP figures are encouraging and will help to further build business and consumer confidence. For the first time since the financial crisis the economy looks and feels as if there is a tailwind behind it. We are optimistic that the current rate of quarterly growth can be maintained through the second half of 2013 and into 2014. Indeed, if one looks to the current broad money supply (the amount of cash and bank deposits) as a leading indicator of economic activity, quarterly growth might actually accelerate slightly over the next 6 months. Second quarter GDP growth of 0.6% is in line with trend growth but not above it. Consequently there is little reason to expect an imminent change in monetary policy by the MPC. The figures won\u2019t have changed views on the size of the output gap and the amount of spare capacity in the economy. The MPC will also be aware that despite the tailwind to growth from the money supply, significant headwinds remain. Key headwinds include the squeeze on household income from inflation running ahead of earnings, bank balance sheet reduction and the ever present threat of a return of the euro crisis. David Cameron tweets that today's data shows Britain is moving in the right direction: Surely it's the hardworking people who are building the economy, prime minister? David Tinsley of BNP Paribas says today's data shows \"relatively well balanced growth\" in the last three months: Within services, distribution, hotels and restaurants rose a very solid 1.5%. That was the stand-out area of strength, most other sub-sectors averaged around 0.5/0.6%. Overall this is a decent but not spectacular performance for the UK economy. The level of output remains 3.3% below its previous peak, which highlights there is still much work to do. Here's a round-up of the best comment and reaction from economists and City experts on Twitter: Ed Balls, shadow chancellor, has responded to the news that Britain's recovery picked up speed last quarter: After three wasted and damaging years of flatlining, this economic growth is both welcome and long overdue. But families on middle and low incomes are still not seeing any recovery in their living standards. While millionaires have been given a huge tax cut, for everyone else life is getting harder with prices still rising much faster than wages. \u201cThis is also the slowest recovery for over 100 years. In America, where President Obama has acted to support rather than strangle the recovery, their economy has grown nearly three times faster than the UK since autumn 2010. Simply to catch up all the ground we have lost under David Cameron and George Osborne we would need growth of 1.3 per cent each quarter over the next two years. Real risks remain. So instead of more complacency from the Chancellor, we need action to catch up all the lost ground and secure a strong and sustained recovery that everybody can benefit from. My colleague Heather Stewart writes: Britain's recovery picked up pace in the second quarter, official figures have confirmed, with GDP expanding by 0.6%. George Osborne, the chancellor, welcomed the fresh evidence that the economy has moved, as he has put it, \"out of intensive care\". \"Britain is holding its nerve, we are sticking to our plan, and the British economy is on the mend,\" he said, \"but there is still a long way to go and I know things are still tough for families. More here: UK GDP growth of 0.6% shows 'Britain is on the mend,' says George Osborne As suspected, most of the growth in the last three months has come from the service sector: This reflects the fact that services still makes up around three-quarters of the overall economy. A recap on the individual growth rates: \u2022 Services: +0.6% \u2022 Production: +0.6%, including +0.4% for manufacturing \u2022 Construction: +0.9% \u2022 Agriculture: +1.1% Chief statistician Joe Grice made the point earlier that UK GDP is still 3.3% below its alltime peak in 2008. This chart shows why -- a massive tumble in output when the financail crisis struck, followed by patchy growth from the start of 2010. Chancellor George Osborne, doubtless invigorated by his adventures last night (photos), has welcomed the GDP data. Osborne said: Britain is holding its nerve, we are sticking to our plan, and the British economy is on the mend - but there is still a long way to go and I know things are still tough for families. So I will not let up in my determination to make sure we put right all that went wrong in our economy. Unlike the unbalanced economy before the crisis, we are going to make sure that everyone benefits from this recovery. And on a year-on-year basis, UK GDP is 1.4% higher than after the second quarter of last year. However, we need to be cautious -- as Q2 2012 contained an extra bank holiday for the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee, hitting output. All four main industrial groupings within the UK economy \u2013 agriculture, production, construction and services \u2013 grew in the second quarter of 2013. That means the economy is firing on 'all cylinders', in City jargon. You can see the the data yourself on the Office for National Statistics website, here: Gross Domestic Product Preliminary Estimate, Q2 2013 Britain's growth of 0.6% over the last three months is in line with City forecasts. It's twice as strong as the 0.3% rise in GDP recorded in the first three months, and is likely to cheer the government. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, comments that it's \"good but unspectacular\". If it continued over a whole year then it would mean annual growth of just under 2.5% -- which would have been unspectacular in ther years before the financial crisis struck. Questions - why has the construction sector grown so well, 0.9%, in the last three months? Joe Grice won't speculate, but agrees that it's a stronger performance for the industry after a difficult time. Joe Grice of the ONS explains that Britain's economy is still 3.3% below its pre-recession peak. BREAKING: Britain's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter of 2013. That's in line with estimates. The service sector grew by 0.6%, Manufacturing grew by 0.4% Construction grew by 0.9%. Tension is building as the Office for National Statistics prepares to announce its first estimate of GDP growth, in just a few moment time. Joe Grice, the ONS's chief economist, is sat at the press conference in London ready to deliver the big news.... Just over 15 minutes to go until we get the first estimate of UK growth for the last three months.... A 0.6% rise in GDP (the consensus view in the City) would mean that the economy has expanded by 1.4% over the last year (unless previous data is revised). That's a lacklustre annual growth rate. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale reckons it won't be enough to persuade the Bank of England to start tightening monetary policy: Year-on year growth of 1.4% is only good when we comapre it to the recent past or to the Euro Zone. And bear in mnd, we saw quarters with 0.6 or 0.7% growth in both 2012 and 2011, but we also saw quarterly falls. This may be marginally better than stagnation but won't alter the prospect of super-easy money being in place for a super-long time. Chancellor George Osborne prepared for this morning's GDP data by spending last night visiting some of Britain's army of night workers in and around Birmingham. He visited a Warburton's bakery, met with construction workers toiling on the M6 motorway, and toured Tesco's National Distribution Centre near Rugby, apparently to learn about how the UK economy runs at night. Where is Britain's growth coming from? The UK government has made plenty of noise about creating the 'March of the Makers\", but economists reckon that the dominant services sector is driving the recovery. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities predicts: Retail spending is seen contributing just 0.1 ppt to today's report, and construction output has been sluggish, with Services presumably assumed to have done most of the 'heavy lifting'. Dr Gerard Lyons, economic adviser to Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, cautions against getting too excited about today's UK GDP figures. There are signs of recovery in Spain, too, this morning. Its unemployment rate has fallen for the first time since it entered recession almost two years ago, but remains alarmingly high. The jobless rate dropped to 26.3% in the second quarter of this year, from 27.2% in January-March. The total number of people out of work dropped to 5.98m, from 6.20m, while the employment total increase by 149,000 to 16.8m. The south of the country continues to suffer the greatest unemployment rates, as this image shows: Good morning, and welcome to our coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Are things looking up for the British economy? We'll find out this morning, when growth figures for the second quarter of 2013 are released. City economists expect to see a rise in GDP, of perhaps 0.6%, which would be twice as strong as the growth in the first three months of this year, when Britain avoided falling back into recession. That would be welcome news to a country that's suffered weak growth, or worse, over the last few years. A strong performance is certain to be hailed by the government as vindication for its economic strategy. As the Guardian explains this morning: The Treasury will try to maintain a cautious posture, but start to put the political squeeze on the shadow Treasury team by claiming its dire predictions of mass unemployment have been proved untrue. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, in the US for talks with the Obama administration, has already prepared the ground for the change of economic gear by highlighting the continued squeeze on living standards. The UK will be the first major economy to estimate growth for the April-June period. In GDP forecasting (as in sport), Britain typically beats most other countries so the data will be a handy - if perhaps inaccurate - guide to economic conditions: A healthy rise in UK GDP could add to the optimism created yesterday by the latest survey of European firms, which suggested the eurozone may finally be leaving recession. The GDP data is released by the Office for National Statistics at 9.30am BST sharp, followed by a press conference in London. I'll be covering the news and reaction in the liveblog, along with other key developments in the UK, the eurozone, and beyond through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Ian Livingston, the BT chief executive and incoming trade and investment minister, has lashed out at the influential parliamentary committee chaired by Margaret Hodge, claiming its members are seeking publicity rather than the truth. Hodge's public accounts committee has put the issue of tax avoidance by multinationals including Amazon and Starbucks at the centre of national debate, and last week took on BT, lambasting the former national telecoms company for \"blackmailing the public\" by demanding subsidies to build broadband in rural areas. Presenting his final set of company results before leaving BT in September to join the government at David Cameron's request, Livingston hit back after his company's dressing down by the committee's members. \"If you watch the public accounts committee meetings, they are clearly designed to attract publicity rather than get to the underlying truth,\" Livingston countered on Thursday. BT is investing \u00a32.5bn in rolling out fibre-optic cables to two thirds of homes in the UK, and has won contracts for \u00a31.2bn in public subsidies to further extend its network to rural locations. But the government-run Broadband Development UK programme, for which BT has won every contract so far, is running nearly two years late. The National Audit Office has criticised civil servants and BT for delays, lack of transparency, and making it difficult for other companies to invest in the most isolated locations, where BT has no plans to build. \"It is just a shame that a number of people in the UK don't want to talk up the UK,\" said Livingston. \"What BT will do is continue to talk up the UK and point out we have some of the cheapest available fibre in the western world \u2026 it is going to many, many rural areas and it is a big success story. Most government officials recognise it has been a great success.\" The government has conceded that the BDUK rural broadband rollout will be completed at least 22 months behind schedule. It will also not reach the final 5% of most isolated homes. Investment in these areas by alternative network providers has been held back because so far BT and local councils have resisted publishing lists of areas where they definitely will not build. The BT head of strategy, Sean Williams, was summoned before the PAC last week and came under repeated attack during a bad-tempered meeting. Hodge described the delays as a \"ridiculous state of affairs\". She also questioned why BT had said it would require government subsidies to connect fibre to a new housing development in the London suburb of Barking. She said: \"I could understand if it was in Cumbria, but this is in outer London. You're blackmailing the public by saying: 'We'll only do it with a subsidy.'\" BT was also accused of behaving like a \"vampire death squid\" in the rural broadband market by Malcolm Corbett, chief executive of the Independent Networks Co-operative Association, who gave evidence at the PAC meeting. Speaking to analysts after BT's first quarter results, Livingston insisted his ministerial role would give him no say over telecoms matters. \"In government my remit does not cover anything to do with BT other than BT being one of the country's most significant investors and exporters.\" Livingston is one of the largest private holders of BT shares and could own a stake worth up to \u00a320m once he leaves the company. The Labour MP Jon Trickett has written to David Cameron, who recruited Livingston to government, to ask whether the shareholding is in breach of the ministerial code. Government officials say he will have to place his shares in a blind trust. Livingston succeeds the former HSBC boss Lord Green, and will work across the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Like Green, he will become a peer, sitting on the Conservative benches of the House of Lords.",

      "bodyText": "Drinks companies are obviously hoping the heatwave continues, not least because they have seen rather mixed fortunes so far this year, judging by a number of updates. Pubs group Mitchells &amp; Butlers, owner of All Bar One and Harvester, said like-for-like sales roe 1.6% in the 14 weeks to this week. Chief executive Alistair Darby said: While the cash in people's pockets remains tight, consumers continued to demand great service and excellent value when they eat and drink out. In this context, we are pleased with the progress that we are making. Profit taking left M&amp;B shares 25.7p lower at 401.1p but James Wheatcroft at Jefferies said: We view the 6% fall in M&amp;B's share price to 400p as an overreaction to today's admittedly lacklustre third quarter statement. Our investment thesis remains intact: sort out cash pension contributions + reinstatement of dividend = re-rating. We reiterate our buy recommendation and 500p price target. Meanwhile rival Marstons, down 5.8p at 158.7p, said sales in its premium pubs were up 2.1% in the latest 42 week period but had risen 6% in the last ten weeks. Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner reported a 10% rise in the 16 weeks to 20 July \"aided by the recent spell of glorious weather.\" Its shares have added 25p to 950p.

Barr is down 0.5p at 557p. Meanwhile Britvic, its erstwhile merger partner before the deal fell apart, has fallen 7.5p to 514.5p as third quarter revenues rose 4%, helped by marketing campaigns with Beyonce and Wimbledon tennis championship.

      "standfirst": "Outsourcing group reports 10% rise in profits but analysts point to easing of full year margin target", 
      "body": "<p>With the FTSE 100 slipping back despite a number of upbeat trading statements, <strong>Capita</strong> is one of the leading fallers on concerns about its profit margins.</p> <p>The outsourcing group has slipped nearly 3%, down 30p at \u00a310.07, despite reporting a 10% rise in underlying half year profits to \u00a3205.2m. It said it had won a record \u00a32bn worth of contracts during the half, including a deal with O2 owner Telefonica and the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>Capita's growth came organically and from recent acquisitions, and there are further asset purchases in the pipeline. The company said it was confident in its full year performance and expected progress in 2014 and beyond. But Caroline de La Soujeole at Cantor Fitzgerald issued a sell note, saying:</p> <blockquote> Half year results were a touch below consensus expectations. Organic growth of 3% was achieved but EBITA margins came under more pressure than expected, down 80 basis points to 12.5%... The decline in the operating margin, which reflects acquisition integration costs and contract implementation costs, is unprecedented we believe. The guidance for the full year margin and beyond has now been subtly changed. Previous guidance for 2013 was for a margin of 13.4%. The statement now suggests that: \"based on current circumstances, we expect to achieve full year margins in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% for the foreseeable future\". This compares with a 2012 EBITA margin of 13.9%. In light of today's disappointing results and commentary on margins, we retain our sell recommendation and target price of 810p. <br> </blockquote> <p>At Investec, analyst Gideon Adler kept his hold recommendation and also pointed to the margin issue:</p> <blockquote> Capita has reported a broadly in-line set of interim results, with a soft amendment to margin guidance likely to capture attention. Organic revenue guidance of 'at least 8%' has been reiterated, with Capita set to benefit from a strong second half supported by recent contract wins.

      "bodyText": "With the FTSE 100 slipping back despite a number of upbeat trading statements, Capita is one of the leading fallers on concerns about its profit margins. The outsourcing group has slipped nearly 3%, down 30p at \u00a310.07, despite reporting a 10% rise in underlying half year profits to \u00a3205.2m. It said it had won a record \u00a32bn worth of contracts during the half, including a deal with O2 owner Telefonica and the Cabinet Office. Capita's growth came organically and from recent acquisitions, and there are further asset purchases in the pipeline. The company said it was confident in its full year performance and expected progress in 2014 and beyond. But Caroline de La Soujeole at Cantor Fitzgerald issued a sell note, saying: Half year results were a touch below consensus expectations. Organic growth of 3% was achieved but EBITA margins came under more pressure than expected, down 80 basis points to 12.5%... The decline in the operating margin, which reflects acquisition integration costs and contract implementation costs, is unprecedented we believe. The guidance for the full year margin and beyond has now been subtly changed. Previous guidance for 2013 was for a margin of 13.4%. The statement now suggests that: \"based on current circumstances, we expect to achieve full year margins in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% for the foreseeable future\". This compares with a 2012 EBITA margin of 13.9%. In light of today's disappointing results and commentary on margins, we retain our sell recommendation and target price of 810p. At Investec, analyst Gideon Adler kept his hold recommendation and also pointed to the margin issue: Capita has reported a broadly in-line set of interim results, with a soft amendment to margin guidance likely to capture attention. Organic revenue guidance of 'at least 8%' has been reiterated, with Capita set to benefit from a strong second half supported by recent contract wins. Cash conversion remains robust and the outlook strikes a positive tone, but with on-going investment behind contract mobilisation and the integration of acquisitions likely to curtail margin momentum, we remain cautious holders for now. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 28.20 points at 6592.23, little changed from before the in-line UK GDP figures. Among the other fallers, Arm is down 47p to 841.5p after Wednesday's results, with UBS removing the chip designer from its key calls list. But Rolls-Royce has climbed 55p to \u00a312.35 following a better than forecast 34% rise in first half profit to \u00a3840m and a promise to do more on improving its cost performance. Reed Elsevier also benefited from figures, up 30p to 831p, while Barclays was 1.95p better at 322.5p on hopes it was close to a deal with the regulator to allow it to achieve a 3% leverage ratio by the end of 2014.
