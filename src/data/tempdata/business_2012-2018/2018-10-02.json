      "bodyText": "Noel Edmonds has failed in a bid to get Lloyds Bank\u2019s black horse TV ads banned, as the TV presenter\u2019s \u00a360m legal battle with the banking group becomes increasingly acrimonious. The former Deal or No Deal presenter\u2019s claim stems from a historic fraud scandal at the bank\u2019s HBOS Reading arm, which affected 60 small business owners, relating to losses from the collapse of his entertainment firm Unique Group a decade ago, as well as the distress and humiliation he says he has suffered. Keystone Law, representing Edmonds and other victims of the fraud, lodged a complaint with the advertising regulator against the bank\u2019s TV campaign featuring its famous black horse. The ad campaign features a black horse running past a memorial service, a neighbourhood with a mother caring for her baby and on a beach with children. A voiceover said: \u201cYesterday, today, and tomorrow we have been and always will be by your side.\u201d Music lyrics in the background included the line \u201cwe\u2019ve come a long, long way together, through the hard times and the good\u201d. The law firm said that the ad campaign was misleading and should be banned because it objected to the way Lloyds Bank, which acquired HBOS after the fraud, had handled customers affected by the scandal. Lloyds said the claims in the ad were not misleading and that 85% of those it identified in a review as affected by the scandal had accepted compensation. The Advertising Standards Authority rejected Keystone\u2019s complaint, saying the ad did not break its rules. The watchdog said the claim to customers to literally be \u201cby your side\u201d was \u201cadvertising puffery\u201d. The ASA said it did not believe that viewers \u201cwould interpret the claim to be a commentary on the situation of the victims of the HBOS fraud case, or to think that it was directly connected to their engagement with Lloyds Bank in 2018\u201d. \u201cWe did not consider the details of the HBOS fraud case to be material information that needed to be included in the ad to prevent customers from being misled.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Italian deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, has threatened to sue Jean-Claude Juncker for damages, accusing the EU president of pushing up Rome\u2019s cost of borrowing by likening Italy to Greece. Salvini, who is also Italy\u2019s interior minister and leader of the far-right League party, was speaking after Juncker\u2019s comments helped send the yield on Italian benchmark bonds to a four-and-a-half year high of 3.4%, while shares in Italian banks plunged. He said: \u201cThe European commission president Juncker, by equating Italy with Greece, sends the spread [gap] crazy. He could have spared us that.\u201d Salvini added: \u201cHe should drink two glasses of water before opening his mouth, and stop spreading non-existent threats. Or we\u2019ll ask him for damages.\u201d Juncker said earlier this week that the Italian governing coalition\u2019s pledge to press ahead with a budget deficit that will breach European Union rules threatens the euro\u2019s existence. Salvini said Brussels was exaggerating the impact of Rome pushing ahead with its planned 2.4% budget shortfall for at least the next three years. He said the rising cost of financing Italy\u2019s debts was the fault of EU officials who had spooked investors and increased the gap, also known as spread, between Italian and German borrowing costs. Salvini added: \u201cThe words and threats of Juncker and other European bureaucrats continue to make the spread rise, with the aim of attacking the government and the Italian economy. We are ready to ask damages from those who wish Italy ill.\u201d Juncker said the European commission would need to be firm with Italy\u2019s budget bill \u201cor else the euro ends\u201d. Deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, Salvini\u2019s coalition partner and the leader of the Five-Star Movement, backed his ally\u2019s uncompromising line to set a budget that could push Italy\u2019s debt to a GDP ratio higher than last year\u2019s 131.2%. The move prompted the sale of Italian government bonds and an increase in the interest rate charged by Italy\u2019s lenders as investors, fearing that the country was heading closer to defaulting on its debts, took flight. The sale of Italian bonds accelerated after the Eurosceptic League MP, Claudio Borghi, said the country\u2019s economic situation would be easier if it were outside the eurozone. However, Borghi, who is not a minister, did not suggest the government planned to leave the euro. The coalition has argued that it is adopting a longer-term strategy to dig Italy out of the economic doldrums. It insists the controversial spending plans will accelerate economic output and turn around decades of stagnant growth, high youth unemployment and declining tax receipts. Over the next year, the finance ministry expects the budget deficit to hit 2.4%, slightly higher than last year\u2019s 2.3%. However, it is hoped that the mix of spending, much of it on health and a universal basic income alongside a boost for infrastructure projects, will increase lacklustre consumer spending to push GDP growth beyond last year\u2019s 1.6%. Di Maio said: \u201cWe are not turning back from that 2.4% target, that has to be clear ... We will not backtrack by a millimetre.\u201d The decision follows a row inside the cabinet after the technocratic finance minister, Giovanni Tria, recommended a budget with a 1.6% deficit to stay within EU rules and prevent the overall debt-to-GDP ratio worsening. While a headline deficit of 2.4% would be within the 3% European Union limit, its emphasis on reducing the effects of austerity means its structural \u2013 or underlying \u2013 deficit would rise along with the headline figure, which runs contrary to EU rules. Juncker said at the weekend that he was concerned about plans to push up Italy\u2019s public debt pile, proportionally the second highest in the EU after Greece\u2019s. He said: \u201cItaly is distancing itself from the budgetary targets we have jointly agreed at EU level. I would not wish that, after having really been able to cope with the Greek crisis, we\u2019ll end up in the same crisis in Italy.\u201d Salvini said in response: \u201cNo one in Italy is taken in by Juncker\u2019s threats.\u201d He added that the government\u2019s priority was to respond to the basic needs of its citizens and that the criticism of its budget \u201cwill not stop us\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Euro hit by Italian budget row; Amazon raises minimum wage - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on Amazon\u2019s decision to pay its staff more: Goodnight! GW Royal Mail was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 today, shedding another 8% to 359p after Monday\u2019s profits warning shocker. European stock markets ended the day lower, although Italy clawed its way back from an early-morning selloff. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 closed 21 points lower, or -0.28%, at 7,474, with Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB down a similar amount. The French CAC shed 0.7%, though, while Germany\u2019s DAX lost 0.4%. In the currency markets, the pound is down half a percent at $1.2978, having hit a three week low today. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE, which is normally a fan of a pummelled pound, found little to celebrate as the day went on, slipping 30 or so points to hit 7470. This despite a decent rebound from its miners, and the (admittedly slim) gains made by BP and Shell as Brent Crude lurked around $85 per barrel. Over in the Eurozone, the conflict between the EU and Italy has not only dragged the euro lower, but caused the region\u2019s indices to reverse Monday\u2019s growth. Happy scenes at an Amazon warehouse as the news broke: Bernie Sanders has given Amazon his blessing, and urged other businesses chiefs to copy them: Amazon\u2019s pay hike could be a watershed moment for the global economy, says Hinesh Patel of Quilter Investors. Patel thinks the move is partly PR-driven \u2014 having the world\u2019s richest man leading tens of thousand of poorly paid staff isn\u2019t a great look... In that sense, this shift is about improving the company image and guarding Amazon\u2019s reputation. But, it also reflects changes in the jobs market, where tight labour supply is giving workers more muscle. If so, other firms may be forced to follow, Patel explains: \u201cToday\u2019s news could be a watershed moment in this paradigm shift, with one of the largest employers and a household name making such a bold statement on wages. This will place pressure on other large corporates to follow up this move with a comparable remuneration offer of their own. While these wage raises will cost Amazon, it has the financial might to absorb that cost increase and put the squeeze on rivals as the ripple effect of these wage rises hits other corporates. Similarly, while the national minimum wage has been static for some time, at state level increases have been implemented and today\u2019s news could prompt Washington to revise the national minimum, with Amazon already indicating they will be lobbying Congress to that effect. \u201cMarkets will be watching the impact of this dynamic closely. A tightening labour market could create healthy inflation and boost consumer spending power but it could also have an impact on corporate earnings. Back in the financial markets, Italy\u2019s deepening dispute with Brussels has driven the euro down to a six-week low. The single currency has dropped to $1.154 against the US dollar, down 0.3%, as Rome refuse to back down over its spending plans. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio raised the stakes by insisting that his government will stick to its deficit target - of 2.4% of GDP. He told a radio interview: \u201cWe are not turning back from that 2.4 percent target, that has to be clear ... We will not backtrack by a millimetre.\u201d Italian bonds have also weakened today, pushing the gap with safe-haven German debt to a four-year high. Di Maio has insisted that his government aren\u2019t planning to leave the euro...but also blasted Brussels officials for fuelling the crisis. Investors are fretting that the eurozone crisis could be poised for another act. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The administration in Rome are set to be on a collision course with Brussels over the proposed size of its deficit. Traders are worried that Italy might be aiming to exit the euro and or the EU, but Luigi Di Maio, one of the joint Deputy Prime Ministers denied those claims this morning. The political rumbling in Italy is weighing on their banking sector due to its exposure to the Italian government bond market. The UNI Global Union, a collection of 900 unions from 150 countries, is also pushing Amazon to do more for its workers. UNI Global Union General Secretary Christy Hoffman argues that Jeff Bezos must do better. She also points out that Amazon workers who are members of ver.di, the largest service worker union in Germany, began a two-day strike on Monday to push for pay increases. Hoffman says: \u201cA trillion-dollar company headed by the richest man in the world should pay its workers a wage above the poverty line. While this is a step forward, it is a long way from where Amazon needs to be. \u201cThese pay rises come only after workers and communities have demanded better from the company\u2014including Amazon workers striking in Germany today. Instead of giving Amazon pats on the back, unions around the world will continue pushing Amazon until it is a truly responsible global company, until it recognises union rights.\u201d Amazon\u2019s move comes four weeks after the Archbishop of Canterbury warned that Britain\u2019s economic model was broken, with the gap between the rich (led by Jeff Bezos) and the poor widening. Archbishop Welby is part of a new commission on Economic Justice, led by the IPPR thinktank. It proposed a swathe of measures including a higher minimum wage, more protection for workers, and better regulation of digital firms. IPPR director Tom Kibasi has tweeted that Amazon\u2019s wage increases are a start: UK opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has tweeted that Amazon\u2019s pay increase shows the power that workers can have if they work together. However, US Amazon workers have found it extremely hard to unionise. Some have reported intense pressure from management when they tried to form a union. Amazon\u2019s pay hike may also be a sign that the company is finding it harder to recruit staff, especially with Black Friday and Christmas coming up... This is from Mike Jakeman, PwC\u2019s global economist: Britain\u2019s unions aren\u2019t too impressed by Amazon\u2019s pay rise - and are urging the company to improve working conditions too. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cAmazon is a trillion-dollar company. It can easily afford to pay staff higher wages. \u201cIf Amazon is really serious about looking after its workforce it must recognise trade unions. And it must end the exploitative working practices that have seen hundreds of ambulances called to its UK warehouses. \u201cAll workers deserve decent conditions at work \u2013 not surveillance, inhuman targets and the threat of a disciplinary if they to go to the toilet. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is the result of campaigning by the GMB and unions around the world. It\u2019s only a start and shouldn\u2019t be spun as a huge act of generosity.\u201d Back in 2016, journalist James Bloodworth worked undercover at an Amazon warehouse, and reported that some staff were urinating in bottles because they feared disciplinary action if they took a toilet break. What could possibly have prompted Amazon\u2019s sudden largesse? Well, the company has been facing rising criticism on both sides of the Atlantic for its business practices, from pay and conditions to its tax bills. Progressive US senator Bernie Sanders has targeted the company with a new bill called Stop BEZOS. It would penalise companies whose poorly paid staff were forced to take welfare payments to make ends meet. Amazon is one of the biggest employers of those who receive food stamps in the United States, with nearly one in three Amazon workers on food stamps in Arizona and one in 10 in Pennsylvania and Ohio. European workers are also unhappy. There have been strikes in Italy, Germany and Spain as unions demand better pay and conditions from the company. UK workers have also warned that conditions at Amazon\u2019s warehouses are below standard, with ambulances had been called out 600 times to the online retailer\u2019s UK warehouses in the past three years. Today\u2019s pay rise won\u2019t address those issues, but may show that Amazon has recognised it has a serious problem. And just yesterday, chancellor Philip Hammond called for urgent reforms to the way big technology firms are taxed. Amazon actually halved its UK corporation tax bill last year to \u00a34.5m, despite continuing to grow strongly - often at the expense of traditional retailers. Here\u2019s our news story on Amazon\u2019s dramatic wage increases: Amazon had previously paid its UK staff \u00a38 per hour, or \u00a38.20 in London. So staff in the capital are getting a pay rise of up to 28%, while those in the rest of the country could earn 18% more. That\u2019s a whopping inflation-busting increase, especially as average UK wages are rising by less than 3% at present. Newsflash: Amazon is also hiking its minimum wage in the UK too. It just announced it will now pay at least \u00a310.50 per hour in London, and \u00a39.50 across the rest of the UK. As in America, the rise will apply to all full-time, part-time, temporary (including those hired by agencies), and seasonal employees from the start of November. Amazon says 17,000 staff, and 20,000 seasonal employees, will benefit. Doug Gurr, Amazon VP and UK Country Manager, says: \u201cThis will impact more than 37,000 employees across the country, resulting in higher pay for them and their families.\u201d For comparison, the UK minimum wage for those over 25 is \u00a37.83 per hour, or \u00a37.38 for those under 25. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to Amazon\u2019s decision to raise its minimum wage to twice the US minimum: Amazon have also released a Q&amp;A about their pay rise. Here\u2019s a flavour: Does this apply to Whole Foods and your other subsidiaries? Yes. The new Amazon $15 minimum wage applies to all U.S. employees at Amazon and its subsidiaries. How are you going to work with Congress to raise the federal minimum wage? Our public policy team will work with policymakers in Washington, D.C., to advocate for a higher federal minimum wage. What do you want the federal minimum wage to be raised to? We believe $7.25 is too low. We would look to Congress to decide the parameters of a new, higher federal minimum wage. In another important move, Amazon is going to lobby Congress to raise the Federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour. Jay Carney, Senior Vice President of Amazon Global Corporate Affairs, says: We will be working to gain Congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage. The current rate of $7.25 was set nearly a decade ago. We intend to advocate for a minimum wage increase that will have a profound impact on the lives of tens of millions of people and families across this country.\u201d Amazon\u2019s new $15/hour minimum wage will apply to all full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal workers in the US. It will begin on November 1st, meaning staff should have a little more cash in their pockets for Thanksgiving and Christmas spending. Newsflash from America: E-commerce giant Amazon is raising its minimum wage for US workers to DOUBLE the US minimum. It will now pay at least $15 per hour, compared to the national floor of $7.25 per hour. Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO (and the world\u2019s richest man), says Amazon has responded to criticism over the way it treats its staff. Bezos is now urging other companies to do the same.... \u201cWe listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.\u201d https://twitter.com/LJKawa/status/1047064119751467009 Back in the markets, European stocks have lost ground today as the optimism over the new US-Mexico-Canada trade deal fizzles out. In London, the FTSE 100 has lost almost 50 points to 7448. Royal Mail shares have dropped 7.8% to their lowest level since the company floated in 2014, after a whopping profits warning yesterday. Oil giants BT and Shell are bucking the trend, though; their shares have risen, matching the higher oil price today. The German DAX and French CAC are both down around 1%, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has sunk lower as the row over the 2019 Italian budget worries investors. The relief following the new NAFTA deal did not last long, points out Fiona Cincotta of City Index. She adds: Expectations that the agreement would somehow translate into the easing of trade tensions with China proved wishful thinking \u2013 President Trump poured cold water over those with a sobering comment. Unlike the markets, US officials believe that Trump\u2019s approach will eventually wear China down by stifling foreign investment and discouraging companies to use China as part of their production chain, such as in the case of Apple and its iPhones, and forcing the country to agree to the concessions asked by the US. Brexit may make it much harder for British builders to find skilled staff, warns Blane Perrotton of property consultancy and surveyors Naismiths. \u201cWith the government confirming its plans to make it harder for European workers to come to the UK after Brexit, the construction industry could become an early casualty. \u201cAcross the UK, one in 10 builders is an EU national \u2013 and this figure rises to a third in London. \u201cWith UK construction already struggling from a chronic skills shortage and Brexit sapping investors\u2019 confidence, British builders need restrictions on European workers like they need a hole in the head.\u201d Britain\u2019s retail crisis is also hurting UK construction. With scores of stores closing, there\u2019s less demand for builders to knock up new outlets, argues. Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking says this makes it tougher for construction firms to find work: The commercial sub-sector is facing myriad headwinds, with the London market still heavily exposed to Brexit uncertainty and retail suffering an annus horribilis. \u201cAgainst this background, many contractors are betting big on infrastructure, yet there is only so much work to go round. And with some questioning the merit of the current pipeline of megaprojects, it underlines that there is no risk-free part of the market in which to be invested.\u201d Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says Britain\u2019s builders have plenty to worry about, including Brexit: \u201cDespite the biggest rise in new orders since December 2016, the sector remained in a downbeat mood with business optimism at its second lowest level since the beginning of 2013. \u201cA cause of this malaise pointed to increased cost burdens with both fuel prices on the rise, and acute shortages in raw materials, as supplier delivery times have lengthened to an extent not seen since 2015. The Brexit blot on the landscape was still in evidence as housing activity slowed to a pre-April growth rate and clients hesitated to place orders. Civil engineering was hit the hardest however and under 50 for the second month in a row, which points towards another contraction. Today\u2019s PMI report suggests British builders are struggling, because clients are too worried about Brexit to commit to new projects. Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit (who wrote the report), explains: Construction companies continued to note that political uncertainty acted a key drag on decision- making, with Brexit worries encouraging a wait-and- see approach to spending among clients. The main areas reported as likely to see a boost in the coming year were construction work related to large-scale energy and transport projects.\u201d Newsflash: Growth in Britain\u2019s building sector has fallen to a six-month low. Data firm Markit\u2019s construction PMI (which measures activity in the sector) fell to 52.1 in September, down from 52.9 in August. Civil engineering suffered particularly badly, with growth contracting. Worryingly, business confidence across the sector fell to its second-lowest level in over five years - even though new orders picked up. Markit blames uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, saying: Construction companies noted that political uncertainty and investor concerns about Brexit had dampened confidence in September. Where a rise in business activity was projected, forthcoming energy and transport projects remained the main areas of optimism. Builders also reporting that they were forced to pay more for fuel (thanks to the rising oil price), and for raw materials such as timber. More to follow.... Rising oil prices aren\u2019t great news for the car industry. If petrol becomes pricier, it may deter some consumers from buying a new motor. But another issue is casting a shadow over the Paris Motor Show today - Brexit. Dieter Zetsche, the CEO of Daimler, has warned that the risk Britain leaves the EU without a deal is a serious worry. Zetsche told the Motor Show that: \u201cPossible scenarios are highly worrying. We have analysed possible scenarios since the (2016 Brexit) referendum to prepare ourselves. In sum, it is an extraordinarily sad development.\u201d Peugeot is also concerned. Its European boss, Maxime Picat, told Reuters that its UK manufacturing could suffer if new trade barriers are set up after Brexit. Picat warned: \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing all we can to develop our UK business, restore Vauxhall and Opel profitability, reinvesting in Luton and improving our sites\u2019 competitiveness in order to help them face up to an uncertain future. But there are limits. Those limits are customs barriers,and the loss of freedom of movement, for people and goods. If we get to that point, we will be obliged to take measures. If we suddenly have to start manufacturing for the UK in the UK, and for Europe in Europe, there will necessarily be an impact on UK production. Back in the UK, London house prices have continued to fall. Prices in the capital dropped by 0.7% in the last three months - the fifth quarterly drop in a row, according to the Nationwide building society. More here: There\u2019s lots of chatter that oil could be heading back to $100 per barrel - a level last seen in September 2014. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group, for example, thinks the loss of Iranian supplies will keep prices buoyant: Concerns over tighter supply ahead of the Iran embargo are keeping the bulls firmly in control. Iran supplies almost 3% of the world\u2019s daily oil consumption, so any sanctions on Iran will hit the supply side of the equation, and hard. Supply is looking fragile and when you then throw in Venezuela\u2019s declining output, the price looks well supported at $85 with $100 in sight. Bloomberg\u2019s Julian Lee agrees that Donald Trump\u2019s attack on Iran\u2019s economy (triggered by his withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal) are partly to blame: The loss of nearly a million barrels a day [from Iran] and the prospect of more to follow, have done more than anything else to revive the possibility of $100 oil. Little wonder Trump has tweeted his frustration at an increasingly powerless OPEC. Most members of that group are already producing as much as they can. Even if they could squeeze out more barrels, doing so would only raise worries about diminishing the cushion of spare capacity to offset any future disruption to supply. Oil at $100 a barrel would be bad news for drivers everywhere \u2014 including those in the U.S. \u2014 and the sanctions on Iran are making it increasingly likely. With the midterm elections looming, it\u2019s no surprise that the president is trying to deflect blame for outcome of his foreign policy onto foreign oil producers. Oil has \u201csprung another gusher overnight\u201d, says Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA, as he watches the US crude price hit a fresh four year high. He believes the new USMCA trade deal is also pushing crude prices up: Ultimately the markets remain singularly focused on the prospect of supply disruptions from Iran which is the primary driver of oil prices. And of course, the US/Mexico/Canada trade agreement will have a longer-term positive impact on oil prices in a broader macro context. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets fears that higher oil prices will choke off growth, at a time when trade war fears are also hurting confidence: IMF head Christine Lagarde warned yesterday that the fund was likely to be downgrading its global growth outlook in the coming days, and its hard to argue that an oil price that could be heading towards $90 a barrel at a time when economic activity is slowing, is conducive to a strong growth picture. If anything, it will act as a pinch on consumer spending and could well choke it off altogether if it moves towards $100. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is on a tear, hitting its highest level in four years, sparking speculation that the world economy could return to the era of $100 per barrel again. Brent crude - sourced from the North Sea - has jumped over $85 per barrel, a level last seen in November 2014. US crude has also hit a four-year high this morning, surging to nearly $76 per barrel. The oil price has now surged by 50% in the last 12 months, driving up transport costs and threatening to drag on global growth. This won\u2019t please Donald Trump, who has been been loudly lobbying Opec to get the oil price down, fearing it will hurt American consumers. But the president must take some responsibility - his sanctions on Iran are one factor driving prices up. Analysts estimate that Trump\u2019s block on Iranian oil exports could remove 1.5 million barrels per day from the global market. That\u2019s a significant loss, at a time when global demand is rising towards 100 million barrels per day. Oil, after all, isn\u2019t immune to the law of supply and demand. As Norbert Ruecker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer, puts it: \u201cOil prices continue to climb, supported by the nearing Iran embargo and related supply concerns. \u201cThe supply situation looks fragile indeed, as any additional shortfall such as a deterioration of the situation in Venezuela would tighten oil supplies.\u201d We\u2019ll be tracking the oil price closely through the day. Also coming up today It\u2019s a quiet day on the economic front, but we will find out how Britain\u2019s builders fared last month. Investors will also be watching Italy nervously, as the row with Brussels over its budget deepens. European finance ministers may discuss the situation as they gather for an ECOFIN meeting in Brussels later today.

More companies than ever are making efforts to fully disclose their political donations, according to a survey by Center for Political Accountability (CPA) and the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Released in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, this years survey found 57 companies in the S&amp;P 500 received scores for political disclosure and accountability of 90% or above, up from 50 last year and double the 28 companies that received that grade in 2015. Three companies received a 100% disclosure score, up from one last year. More S&amp;P 500 companies also had disclosure and accountability policies and practices that scored in the first and second tiers (100% to 60%), a total of 196 compared with 174 in 2015. Bruce Freed, CPA president, said there were a number of factors driving the change \u2013 not least the politically charged atmosphere that has rent the US. \u201cCompanies recognise that political spending poses not just a reputational risk but a business risk,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a more volatile midterm election season. Companies that spend political money in this climate are taking a risk of consumer blowback or even boycotts.\u201d Having a clear policy on disclosing political donations makes it easier for executives to say no to political action committees and others, he said, especially when some of those donors want the donations to remain private. The rise has also been fueled by shareholder activism. On average 35% of shareholders voted in favor of motions proposing clear political donations disclosure policies last year, up from 30% the year before. While Freed acknowledged that corporate money was still pouring into political campaigns, and the survey does not look at lobbying cash, he said it was now see transparency as a way to \u201cenhance their reputations and to avoid blowback\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail\u2019s share price has sunk to its lowest level since the time of its flotation five years ago after investors were left shocked by a surprise profit warning. The company, which had \u00a3800m wiped off its stock market value after issuing the profit warning on Monday, has continued its downward spiral on Tuesday. It was hit by a further 9% dive in its share price, making it the biggest faller in the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. With its share price hovering just under 360p, the company is close to the 330p it floated at in October 2013. The government and its city advisers were heavily criticised for bungling the privatisation of Royal Mail, with a committee of MPs concluding that taxpayers lost out on \u00a31bn because it was underpriced. Royal Mail is currently valued at \u00a33.7bn \u2013 it was valued at \u00a33.3bn at flotation \u2013 and now faces the prospect of being ejected from the FTSE 100. \u201cRoyal Mail has seen a share price collapse which makes it a prime candidate for relegation from the FTSE 100 next time a reshuffle takes place in December,\u201d said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The company said it intended to \u201clook at all the levers\u201d that it could pull to rebuild profits, including potentially raising the price of stamps and cutting jobs. On Monday, Royal Mail surprised investors with an emergency stock market announcement, slashing its profits guidance for this year to \u00a3500m-\u00a3550m, compared with \u00a3694m last year. The company blamed a combination of factors, including a bigger than expected slump in the marketing mail sector as a result of GDPR, the new EU regulations that put tighter controls on the gathering and storage of personal information. The rules have hit the amount of unsolicited or junk mail being sent out. Royal Mail also revealed a huge miss in its target for improving productivity, which is up only 0.1% against an aim of 2-3%. The missed target has resulted in the scrapping of an ambition to find \u00a3230m in cost savings this year. Royal Mail has said it now only expects to achieve \u00a3100m in savings. The group\u2019s chair, Peter Long, stepped down last month after being accused of \u201coverboarding\u201d \u2013 having too many boardroom jobs. His departure also followed one of the biggest executive pay revolts in UK corporate history. Almost three-quarters of investors refused to support a lucrative pay deal for the new chief executive, Rico Back, which included a \u00a36m \u201cgolden hello\u201d to compensate him for moving from another part of the Royal Mail business.",

      "bodyText": "Shell has approved a $12bn (\u00a39.3bn) investment in a mega energy project to send supercooled gas from Canada to China and other Asian countries as they turn from coal to gas. The scheme will be Canada\u2019s biggest ever infrastructure project and is the world\u2019s first major liquefied natural gas project to be given the go-ahead in five years. Shell has a 40% stake in the $31bn Canada LNG joint venture, along with Malaysian, Chinese, Japanese and South Korean energy firms. The world\u2019s appetite for LNG, where gas is cooled to -162C (-259.6F) so it can be shipped in huge tankers, had exceeded expectations in the past year and made the project viable, Shell said. China is forecast to massively increase its consumption of LNG as it looks to gas as a solution to its air pollution problems caused by coal power stations. \u201cWe believe LNG Canada is the right project, in the right place, at the right time,\u201d said the company\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden. Shell is the world\u2019s leading trader of LNG, thanks to its \u00a347bn acquisition of gas firm BG Group three years ago. But earlier this year the company said an LNG supply crunch would occur in the next decade because of a lack of new projects and rising demand, which it expects to double by 2035. Construction will begin immediately on the Canada project, with gas ready to ship in the mid-2020s, potentially as early as 2023 according to some analysts. Jessica Uhl, Shell\u2019s chief financial officer, said: \u201cWe believe the market needs more supply \u2013 and the timing of when this project will come onstream sits nicely with the market fundamentals.\u201d The Anglo Dutch firm said the Canada LNG project would be more competitive than rival US projects, because supplies would reach Asian countries in 10 days rather than 24 days for gas shipped from the US Gulf, which has to travel via the Panama canal. \u201cRegardless of what others are doing, this is the most competitive to be built,\u201d Uhl said. The scheme will be reliant on a new 416-mile pipeline being built to transport gas from fields in northern British Columbia to the coast, where it will be processed and stored before being transferred to tankers. Uhl said the company\u2019s engagement with First Nations and local communities had been truly unprecedented, and suggested she did not expect the project to be delayed by opposition. \u201cClearly there\u2019s been challenges on pipelines around the world \u2026 We think we\u2019ve adequately managed that risk to date,\u201d she said. She said the scheme would provide positive cashflow for Shell even if gas prices fell significantly. Industry watchers welcomed the decision to go ahead. \u201cWe sense that the risks from the Shell perspective are lower than many in the market may think,\u201d said analysts at investment bank Barclays. Shell\u2019s share price was up 0.15% on Tuesday. Oil and gas analysts Wood Mackenzie said the investment was a sign that \u201cmega projects are back\u201d and it expected several other major LNG projects to get the go-ahead next year.",

Shell\u2019s share price was up 0.15% on Tuesday.</p> <p>Oil and gas analysts Wood Mackenzie said the investment was a sign that \u201cmega projects are back\u201d and it expected several other major LNG projects to get the go-ahead next year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Toyota would be forced to halt car production in the UK and BMW could shift production of the Mini to the Netherlands if there is a no-deal Brexit, car manufacturers warned at the Paris Motor Show. Johan Van Zyl, the chief executive of Toyota Europe, said it would have to temporarily close its Derbyshire plant, which employs about 2,600 people, and its future would be uncertain. He said: \u201cIf there would be any disruption we\u2019d have to close our plant temporarily to make alternative arrangements. \u201cIn the longer term, if we were to change the logistics it would add more cost and impact on our competitiveness, and of course the future of our operation.\u201d About 90% of the cars made at the Burnaston plant in Derbyshire are exported to Europe. BMW could shift production of the Mini to the Netherlands in the event of a hard Brexit, its chief executive said. The German carmaker said it was preparing for the \u201c50-50 chance\u201d of the UK leaving the EU without a deal that would allow the current movement of parts and goods. The BMW chief executive, Harald Kr\u00fcger, said on Tuesday he had told the UK prime minister, Theresa May, and EU leaders that a hard Brexit would mean \u201cboth sides are losers\u201d. He said: \u201cWe will no longer fulfil trade agreements and then we are forced to build the [Mini] car in the Netherlands. \u201cHard Brexit is currently not our main scenario but we are preparing for it. We see a 50-50 chance.\u201d His words were echoed by other motor company bosses at the show, with both Daimler and Peugeot expressing concern. Maxime Picat, the European boss of PSA Group, which owns Vauxhall, said that the loss of freedom of movement would \u201cnecessarily impact\u201d UK production and could threaten the sustainability of its manufacturing plants in Luton and Ellesmere Port. Picat said that while PSA had been reinvesting in its UK business, there were limits. \u201cThose limits are customs barriers, and the loss of freedom of movement, for people and goods. If we get to that point, we will be obliged to take measures. \u201cIf we suddenly have to start manufacturing for the UK in the UK, and for Europe in Europe, there will necessarily be an impact on UK production.\u201d Jaguar Land Rover said it was delaying a decision on whether to build electric cars in the UK until the outcome of a Brexit deal. Speaking in Paris, chief executive Ralf Speth told Reuters: \u201cWe haven\u2019t made the decision because we don\u2019t know at the end of the day the final conditions and we also see uncertainty resulting out of the Brexit discussions so we don\u2019t know where we can do the investment best.\u201d Last month JLR, Britain\u2019s biggest car manufacturer, announced that more than 2,000 staff would move to a three-day week at its West Midlands plant, due to \u201cheadwinds\u201d including Brexit and consumer concern about diesel vehicles. Unite, UK\u2019s largest union for car workers, called on ministers to \u201cstop gambling with people\u2019s jobs\u201d. The Unite assistant general secretary, Tony Burke, said: \u201cHow loud do the alarm bells need to ring before the penny drops with Theresa May and her shambolic government that a hard Brexit or a no-deal Brexit will harm investment and damage the UK car industry? \u201cThe jobs at stake are quality jobs that pay a decent wage and sustain communities and towns across the UK. We need a Brexit deal that protects jobs and secures tariff free access and the frictionless trade which our car industry needs.\u201d Vehicle prices are expected to rise sharply in the event of no deal, according to Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders forecasts. The UK car industry employs about 186,000 people and has been one of the most vocal sectors in warning about the impacts of Brexit. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2018 because an earlier version said Toyota\u2019s Derbyshire plant employed about 600 people. This has been corrected to 2,600.",

      "bodyText": "We do our weekly shop at Waitrose using a John Lewis/Waitrose gift card. I am a teacher and my union offers a 6% discount on topping it up. However, this week the balance mysteriously dropped by \u00a3300. Where had my money gone? After initially being advised to report it to the police as fraud, we were told it was a glitch with the gift card system. After much effort on our part, it has refunded the money \u2013 well, it\u2019s back on the gift card. Should I stop using gift cards if they are, in fact, prone to misplacing their balance? RB, Cambridge We initially approached Waitrose for an explanation, but were diverted to John Lewis, which said: \u201cWe\u2019re very sorry for the experience RB had when using her gift card. This was caused by a technical glitch and we have returned the funds to the card. We believe this was a one-off and are not aware of any other occurrences.\u201d So it sounds as though you have just been unlucky. A 6% discount on every single shop sounds too good to miss, but this shows the importance of keeping tabs on your balance and monitoring transactions very carefully.
