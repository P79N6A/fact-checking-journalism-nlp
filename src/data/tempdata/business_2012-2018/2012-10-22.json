      "bodyText": "The Treasury's most senior civil servant has told a committee of MPs that pumping hundreds of billions of pounds worth of cash into the economy as an emergency measure was an \"experiment\" and the results may not be known for years. Permanent secretary Sir Nicholas Macpherson told the public accounts committee there was \"uncertainty\" in Whitehall over whether increasing quantitative easing by \u00a350bn next month to \u00a3425bn was the right move. Richard Bacon, a Conservative member of the committee, said he was \"horrified\" by Macpherson's assessment of the policy. The permanent secretary insisted QE had stopped the UK's economy spiralling further down. \"There is uncertainty around it,\" he told MPs. \"We are very clear it has had a positive on the economy as far as economic activity is concerned. \"We don't really know because even when the economy is working perfectly the precise relationship between a change in interest rates and the economy is very uncertain. \"I'm confident that QE has had a positive effect but in one sense this is an experiment and we won't know the ultimate answer for many years.\" Bacon said QE was the equivalent of around 5% of GDP each year over four years. He added: \"All the things you are talking about are having an effect in the margin, if at all. \"I would have hoped something of the scale would have rather more than a marginal effect. The best you can say is that it has stopped us going into a more vicious cycle,\" he said. Bacon added: \"I was horrified by your description earlier where you basically said, first of all that you didn't anticipate that it would be going on this long, that it's an experiment and we won't know the results for many years and you can't say for sure how much of the benefit is actually coming through to the UK.\" Last week, the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) questioned the impact that a further injection would have on the broader economy, and MPs on the Commons Treasury select committee have launched an inquiry into the policy. The PAC heard that the way the scheme was set up meant government coffers were missing out on extra cash that other nations, such as the United States, were clawing back under their schemes. A Bank of England asset protection fund is holding about \u00a314bn of coupons on gilts bought by an arm of the institution at 0.5% interest. Sir Nicholas told MPs: \"When we set it up we didn't anticipate that quantitative easing would last quite as long as it has nor did we anticipate that quite such a large fund would be built up.\" Last week the Bank of England's most consistent inflation \"dove\" made the case for a fresh boost to demand, warning that the prospect for the UK remains a period of sub-par economic growth and weak inflationary pressure. David Miles, one of the nine members of Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee, said that even though the level of stimulus being provided by the Bank was already \"off the scale\", there was no evidence that the economy was overheating. Miles said: \"The state of the economy is not as good as I had hoped a year or so back, I must admit. The last 18 months have seen no significant growth.\"",

BP has done the opposite. It will end up owning almost 20% of Rosneft and has even agreed to buy a 5.66% slug from the Russian government at 12% above the market price; the overpayment amounts to $500m extra for the Kremlin, hardly a trivial sum even the context of a $27bn transaction. Overall, some $12.3bn will return to London in cash \u2013 nice to have, but less than hoped for. Given the backdrop, you might have assumed that BP chief executive Bob Dudley would seek to reassure the doubters by talking up the exciting exploration adventures to be undertaken in the Arctic with Rosneft. But there were no new Arctic ambitions to report. Maybe they will follow once the oligarchs at AAR, the other half-owner of TNK-BP, are safely off the scene. Instead Dudley asked BP shareholders to consider Rosneft purely as a wonderful investment opportunity: \"Rosneft is a company working to become a global leader in the sector. It is developing its substantial asset base with new technologies and improving its management processes and corporate governance. As a major investor BP looks forward to being able to contribute to Rosneft's success and add value through our participation on the board.\" Okay, the arrangements may turn out to be mutually beneficial for many decades if the Kremlin, which will still own 69.5% of the stock, really has decided that it wants Rosneft to adopt western-style governance and practices. In that case, BP's timing in aligning itself with Russia's oil champion may be perfect and Rosneft's share price, asleep for the past half-decade, may awaken. On the other hand, nobody would pretend that life as a minority shareholder in a President Putin-controlled company will be a bed of roses. BP will appoint two directors to Rosneft's nine-strong board. That's better than having only a token representative but can hardly be viewed as a solid power base in the event of quarrels. Dudley's hands, to some degree, were tied since the option of a clean cash exit from Russia was never on the table. A foreign oil company that invested $8bn in 2003 and has taken out $19bn in dividends (BP's record at TNK-BP) would not then be allowed to wave goodbye to the country with a further $27bn lump sum. Some form of new partnership with the state was inevitable. This deal, then, may be the best that BP could achieve. But tying up $15bn of capital \u2013 more than 10% of BP's market value \u2013 in a single illiquid stock is a big punt. Come back in a decade to learn whether a Rosneft revolution happened.",

The UK is not the only country opposed to a large increase in the EU budget. But few are likely to fight as hard or as long against an increase as the UK.</p> <p>For his part, the British prime minister, David Cameron, is under enormous pressure from his own largely Eurosceptic Conservative Party to veto any budget deal that is inimical to British interests. Further struggles over banking union and efforts to repatriate key powers will follow, as pressures build on both sides of the Channel.

In 10 Downing St., his advisers are not only discussing whether to hold a referendum but also how to win one, says a senior minister involved in the plans. But the weakness of his political position means he cannot rule out leading a campaign to take the U.K. out of the EU if his renegotiation demands are not met.</p> <p>That puts him in a perilous situation. His hopes for a successful renegotiation rest largely on the belief that the euro zone's only hope of survival lies in full political union and the mutualization of debts. But this may be a miscalculation: Much of the fiscal and banking union needed to resolve the crisis are already in place and much of what remains to be done can probably be done within existing treaties, as it was with the fiscal pact. Even if Mr. Cameron had a radical agenda, the rest of the EU may see no need to indulge him\u2014particularly if, as last December, no U.K. interests are at stake.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron's misfortune/strategic blunder is to be trapped between two formidable obstacles. On one flank (<em>the right, presumably</em>) the Conservative Party's eurosceptics. On the other, a European establishment which is more concerned with saving the single currency than helping the Brits backpedal.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T08:59:20.263Z\">at 9.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5085051dc0e343ef1abc7e01\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T08:34:37.092Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Talk of snap elections in Greece</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Political developments in Greece this morning, where an MP has been slung out out the ruling coalition.</p> <p><strong>Nikos Stavrogiannis</strong> was expelled from New Democracy's parliamentary group after he declared on Sunday that he might not support the country's new austerity programme when it comes before parliament.</p> <p>Stavrogiannis said the measure being imposed by the Troika are \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cineffective\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Looks like events are over for the day, so I'm going to shut up shop till the morning. Here's a closing summary of the main developments: \u2022 Ireland has won support from the eurozone's two most powerful leaders over its calls for a new deal on its legacy banking debts. French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said he believes Irish banks should be retrospectively recapitalised (see 15.08 onwards). The comments came hours after Dublin and Berlin issued a joint statement saying Ireland deserves 'special treatment' (see 8.12am onwards) \u2022 Greece has seen political ructions. Finance minister Yiannis Stournaras warned that Athens risks running out of money (see 16.31) while the expulsion of a government MP showed rising tensions over its austerity package (see 12.46) \u2022 David Cameron has pledged not to allow the EU budget to rise above inflation. The UK prime minister told parliament he was still prepared to veto a budget deal, despite German concern (see 15.58 onwards) However both sides denied a report that Angela Merkel might cancel next month's EU summit rather than risk Cameron red-carding the budget (see 11.14 for Berlin's comments and 12.19 for the Downing Street briefing). \u2022 Eurozone and EU government debts hit a record high. Data for 2011 also showed that the overall budget deficit of the euro area and the EU fell last year, but 17 countries have deficits above 3%. (See 10.14 onwards) See you again tomorrow. Thanks (as ever), and goodnight! Some late news out of Nicosia \u2013 Cyprus is planning to contact its Troika of lenders tonight and invite them back to the island for \"final negotiations\" on its aid deal (that's via Reuters). Europe's stock markets have closed, with the main indices mostly lower. Traders say a disappointing set of financial results from Caterpillar have eaten into confidence. FTSE 100: down 13 points at 5882, - 0.2% German DAX: down 58 points at 7322, -0.79% French CAC: down 22 points at 3481, -0.65% Spanish IBEX: down 36 points at 7877, - 0.46% Italian FTSE MIB: up 4 points at 15866, + 0.03% In the debt markets, the yield on Spanish 10-year government bonds has been creeping higher through the afternoon, now up 14 basis points at 5.521%. That reflects uncertainty over when Spain might end the suspense and apply for a bailout. Having survived the weekend's regional elections (see 13.52), Mariano Rajoy might drag the drama out a little longer.... Over in Athens alarming statements have been made this afternoon by the country's ever-optimistic finance minister. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: The Greek finance minister Yiannis Stournaras did not mince his words addressing the Greek parliament this afternoon. Stournaras said that If Greece failed to take receipt of its next rescue loans, \"people would go hungry,\" he said, adding: The cost for the country will be boundless if we don't get the \u20ac31.5bn installment... If we don't get the loan people will go hungry. Stournaras also asked, rhetorically, if MPs think \"the Europeans are bluffing\" over their demands for new cuts, adding: Time is running out. If we want to get the installment before state funds at our disposal are exhausted we must move very quickly. Back to Westminster, where David Cameron has repeated that he will not accept a real-terms increase in the EU budget when leaders meet next month. The PM said: I'm happy to talk, but not happy to spend a lot of money. Cameron added that there is no need to reach a deal on the EU budget in November. However long the issue rumbles on, though, his position won't change.... Cameron also agreed that eurozone banking union will lead towards full political and fiscal union in time, as German taxpayers helping Greek banks or French taxpayers supporting Spanish ones are \"deeply political issues\". News from Helsinki -- Finnish prime minister Jyrki Katainen was unhurt after a man approached him with a knife on Monday. According to Finland's Helsingin Sanomat newspaper, the man was taken into custody in handcuffs after getting within \"a few feet\" of Katainen. There are no reports of injuries. Katainen was campaigning in Turku, in Western Finland. The full story can be seen on Helsingin Sanomat's website (in Finnish). David Cameron was just asked whether he supports the decision to award the Nobe Peace Prize to the European Union. In response, the UK PM said There is a case that the institutions which were put into place after the second world war, and I'd include NATO as well as the European Union, have helped us to settle differences round table and not on the battlefields of Flanders. Cameron also confirmed that he won't be showing up in Oslo to collect the prize, and seemed disappointed that the idea of 27 young people acting as Prize-bearers (which he had argued for) had not found favour. One of David Cameron's own MPs, Douglas Carswell, has blasted the government for agreeing Europe's move towards banking union at last week's summit. Over in parliament, David Cameron is updating MPs on the events at last week' EU council summit. Cameron reiterated that he wants some powers repatriated from Brussels, but does not want the UK to quit the European Union. I don't support the Status Quo, but nor do I believe exit is the answer. Cameron also confirmed that he wants the next EU budget to be capped with an inflation-only increase We need to maximise our leverage on that specific issue Several MPs have asked about the plans for a eurozone banking union, with Conservative MP Bernard Jenkins claiming it is the \"worst of all possible worlds\" for the UK. Cameron disagrees, explaining: The proposals for banking union need to be agreed by unanimity - that is an important safeguard for Britain. But it would not be in Britain's interest to stop the eurozone putting into place something that is necessary for its future. Cameron added that banking union is needed to bring down Spanish and Italian bond yields. Francois Hollande went on to tell the press conference in Paris that he would support a \"retroactive recapitalisation\" of Irish banks. And here's the key quote from Hollande: I said Ireland was a special case and should be treated as such. Hollande also said that France \"will be supportive\" if Spain applies for a bailout. The argument for retrospectively putting new capital into Irish banks is that its bailout came before Europe had agreed its new bailout mechanisms - so Ireland arguably got an unfair deal. Tony Connelly of RTE is in Paris, and reports: Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny has arrived in Paris for his meeting with president Francois Hollande (see 10.45am for more details) And Hollande has been quick to offer Kenny his support, saying that he agrees that Ireland is a special case when it comes to dealing with legacy of its bad banking debts. More to follow... The pound hit another four-month low against the euro today, after dropping around 0.3 of a eurocent to \u20ac1.2266. Sterling has been on a steady slide against the euro since late July, when it came close to hitting \u20ac1.2900. It began falling after Mario Draghi, ECB president, made his famous speech that 'the euro was irreversible'. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said the euro had been boosted today by the Spanish elections: The election results mean that Spain will not see Prime Minister Rajoy leave office anytime soon. This means that Spain\u2019s future in the Euro is secure (at least the near-term horizon is less uncertain, if only marginally). Mariano Rajoy should seize the moment and apply for financial aid immediately now that regional elections are over, argues a research body with close links to Spain's business leaders. Jose Luis Feito, chairman of Instituto de Estudios Economicos, said that Rajoy's victory in Galicia (see 13.52) should be the catalyst for a bailout request. Feito said (via Bloomberg): Spain should accept conditions set by the European Central Bank and other European authorities and the sooner the better... It\u2019s very difficult to impose substantial cuts in public services that hit living standards, but the longer we wait, the more difficult and drastic it\u2019ll be. Last weekend's election results may have bought Rajoy some time. However there are more elections due in a few weeks, which could bolster political parties seeking independence. As Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research points out: The next bid regional election takes place on November 25th in Catalonia where various parties are pushing for more autonomy or even independence. Think of it like Scotland but with a much better football team\u2026 He may have a point... In the City, a calm morning of trading has left the main indices little changed - with the FTSE 100 down just 3 points at 5892, and the German DAX 0.3% lower at 7358. No major drama in the debt markets either, with Spain's 10-year bond yields creeping a little higher to 5.43% this morning. That follows two Spanish regional elections last weekend, which were seen as a possible vote of confidence in the country's austerity prrogramme. The governing People's Party won in Galicia, home state of Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister. However there was also a surge of support for pro-independence candidates in the Basque region, as reported here: Pro-independence parties win Basque country elections in Spain. In short, the election results seen unlikely to trigger the much-awaited aid request from Madrid. As Rebecca O'Keeffe, Head of Investment at Interactive Investor, comments: Rajoy enjoyed a solid victory in regional elections in Galicia, offering support for his current austerity policies, and giving him time to decide when to request a bailout from the EU. This morning's data on eurozone government debt (see 10.14am onwards) also had bad news for Greece, Helena Smith points out. Greece's deficit for 2011 was estimated at 9.4%, up from an earlier forecast of 9.1%. Its debt pile (following March's huge bond swap) was also calculated at \u20ac365bn or 170.6% of GDP up from 165.3%. Helena explains: The figures are further proof that all hopes of reaching the debt-to- GDP ratio of 120% by 2020 are conclusively over. Thus the behind-the-scenes battles between the EU and the IMF over how to bring Greece closer to debt sustainability (as our own Ian Traynor wrote back on 12 October) Helena adds: Prime minister Antonis Samaras told reporters in Brussels last week that he had taken a \u201cdefensive position\u201d over how the debt load could be made sustainable. Over to Athens again, where our correspondent Helena Smith says the expulsion this morning of a governing New Democracy party MP (see 9.34am) has highlighted the vehemence of the opposition to imposing yet more austerity. With only weeks to go before parliament votes on austerity measures worth \u20ac13.5bn \u2013 the biggest package of budget cuts since the debt crisis erupted in Athens three years ago \u2013 prime minister Antonis Samaras is not taking any chances. Opposition over the cuts is fierce with members of all three parties in his fragile coalition refusing to endorse measures that, once again, will hit pensioners and low-income Greeks hardest. By expelling Nikos Stavrogiannis, one of his own MPs, the conservative leader wanted to send a clear message \u201cthat there can be no good or bad politicians who do or don\u2019t support the package,\u201d reported the state-run news network, NET. Samaras's office has also announced that the prime minister will meet his junior coalition partners on Tuesday. Tensions are clearly on the rise, with Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras announcing that \u201cthese should be the first measures that are not passed.\u201d and claiming the coalition \u201cis hanging by a thread.\u201d The spending cuts, which will be spread over two years, have to be voted through Athens\u2019 300-seat House by November 12 when euro zone finance ministers meet to decide whether Greece has qualified for its next cash disbursement \u2013 worth \u20ac31.5bn. Alarmingly, that's only 4 days before Greece runs out of cash. As on insider told Helena: Once more we are in a race against time if the country is to avoid bankruptcy. However, Syriza has also debunked rumours that the party would trigger a snap poll by getting its deputies to resign en masse from parliament. Helena explains: \u201cOur tactic is to have fresh elections and I would say they are close,\u201d Panos Skourletis told me this morning. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it is a demand for elections here and now,\u201d he said, adding that it was unlikely a new poll would be held before the end of the year. The UK government has told reporters in Westminster that Germany has not threatened to cancel next month's summit (at least, not to them, anyway) My colleague Andrew Sparrow was at the Number 10 briefing, and reports that the government also reiterated its opposition to an above-inflation increase. He writes: We do not see the need for an increase in spending above the rate of inflation,\" the spokesman said. He would not say what measure of inflation Cameron would use to judge any proposed budget increase. And he said Number 10 had not been told by the Germans that Angela Merkel would cancel next month's EU summit if Cameron was determined to veto the proposed budget, as the Financial Times reports today (paywall). The full briefing is live on Andrew's Politics Live blog. So could the FT have got it wrong? Seems unlikely..... ...and Channel 4's Faisal Islam agrees: The Bundesbank warned this morning that Europe's crisis measures are increasing the risks to eurozone taxpapers. In its monthly report, Germany's central bank once again voiced its concerns over policies such as the European Central Bank's offer of \"unlimited bond-buying' for a country which seeks help. Here's the key quote: The more effectively monetary policy supports the financial systems of the crisis countries with its measures, the more risks are transferred to the balance sheet of the euro system and ultimately redistributed among all taxpayers of member countries. The crux of the Bundesbank's argument remains that monetary policy is now being used to stabilise the eurozone, which is really the job of fiscal policy. The Bundesbank also predicted that the German economy could shrink during the last three months of 2012 as demand for exports falls, due to problems across the world economy. It said: While industrial orders from the euro zone have not fallen further after massively dropping in previous quarters, the expansion of demand from other countries has come to a standstill in the wake of a global economic slowdown. Neil Prothero, Eurozone analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, warns that Britain faces some tough battles in Europe -- the spat over the EU budget is just one problem among many. Prothero writes: The UK's relations with the EU have always been complicated and prickly, but they are now entering uncharted territory as the policy agenda becomes increasingly dominated by politically sensitive issues setting the UK at odds with its EU partners. The first of these is the seven-year framework for the EU budget, covering the period from 2014 to 2020. The European Commission wants the size of the EU budget to be increased, a proposal which is anathema to the British government at a time of fiscal austerity at home. The UK is not the only country opposed to a large increase in the EU budget. But few are likely to fight as hard or as long against an increase as the UK. For his part, the British prime minister, David Cameron, is under enormous pressure from his own largely Eurosceptic Conservative Party to veto any budget deal that is inimical to British interests. Further struggles over banking union and efforts to repatriate key powers will follow, as pressures build on both sides of the Channel. Financial market pressures are forcing euro zone countries to contemplate deeper integration, while domestic political pressures are pushing the UK in the opposite direction. The UK will therefore find itself fighting some lonely battles over the coming months. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor warned a week ago that last week's EU summit would push Britain closer to the exits in this article: Europe prepares for another Franco-German tussle in Brussels. EU policymakers may not want to push the UK out, but they won't jump through hoops to keep the country in, either. The German government has denied that it is threatening to cancel December's EU summit unless Britain caves in over the European Union's budget (see 8.25am) Steffen Seibert, Angela Merkel's official spokesman, just told reporters in Berlin that the report (the front page splash of today's Financial Times) was wrong. Seibert said: It is not true. I categorically deny this report. The German government has an interest in the success of this special summit in November and supports European Council President Herman van Rompuy in the goal to get an agreement on the long-term 2014-2020 budget. Seibert also tried to calm talk that Britain's future in Europe was at risk, saying the UK is a \"very valued member\" of the EU. But someone will have to change their position over the EU budget. As things stand, Merkel wants a smaller increase than the European Commission is proposing, while Cameron wants no increase at all... There isn't universal joy in Ireland today over the joint statement released by the Dublin and Berlin governments last night. Henry McDonald, our correspondent in Dublin, reports that there is little rejoining on the opposition benches of the Dail (the Irish parliament) at Angela Merkel's show of support (see 8.12am for the details). Henry writes: Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams says today: What is progress is when we get a write-down, when we get our money back. The Louth TD told RTE's \"Good Morning Ireland\" radio show that: The Government have borrowed \u20ac67bn from the troika - \u20ac64bn of that into banks, including some banks which are totally failed. The Taoiseach has yet to say that this debt is unsustainable. Kenny meanwhile is in Paris today where the Taoiseach will meet Francois Hollande and also promote Irish food exports. The Republic exported \u20ac650 million euros worth of food to the EU last year. France remains one of Ireland's biggest markets with the French eating more Irish lamb and seafood that other Europeans. The Taoiseach will join 18 Irish food companies and Bord Bia (the state body promoting Irish foodstuffs) at a world food fair in the French capital. Last night's telephone chat with the German Chancellor and today's trip to Paris will be welcome relief for Kenny after he and his government faced a string of torrid headlines at the weekend. Most of the Irish Sundays claimed the Germans had thrown Kenny under a car by indicating there would be no bank debt deal for Ireland from the new European Monetary System. Over the last 24 hours however the tone of Dublin newspaper coverage has started to change with the Irish Independent reported today that \"Merkel rides to Enda's aid...\" HMcD (check out 8.43am for pictures of two Irish front pages). The government debt figures released by Eurostat this morning (see 10.14) also show that 17 of the 25 members of the EU have deficits above 3% (the maximum level 'permitted' under EU laws). They are: \u2022 Ireland (-13.4%), Greece and Spain (both -9.4%), UK (-7.8%), Slovenia (-6.4%), Cyprus (-6.3%), Lithuania and Romania (both -5.5%), France (-5.2%), Poland (-5.0%), Slovakia (-4.9%), the Netherlands (-4.5%), Portugal (-4.4%), Italy (-3.9%), Belgium (-3.7%), Latvia (-3.4%) and the Czech Republic (-3.3%). Three countries achieved surpluses: Hungary (+4.3%), Estonia (+1.1%) and Sweden (+0.4%) The Eurozone and the European Union's total debt piles both hit new highs last year, new data released by Eurostat shows. But in happier news, the Eurozone and the EU both ran a much smaller deficit in 2011 than in 2010. Here's the topline: \u2022 Eurozone government debt: \u20ac8.22 trillion in 2011, up from \u20ac7.833 trillion in 2010 \u2022 Eurozone debt/GDP: 87.3% in 2011, up from 85.4% in 2010 \u2022 Eurozone deficit: 4.1% of GDP in 2011, down from 6.2% in 2010 \u2022 EU government debt: \u20ac10.433 trillion in 2011, up from \u20ac9.826 trillion \u2022 EU debt/GDP: 82.5% in 2011, up from 80.0% in 2010 \u2022 EU deficit: -4.4% of GDP in 2011, down from 6.5% in 2010 The full release can be downloaded from the Eurostat website. The battle between Angela Merkel and David Cameron over the EU budget (see 8.25am) comes amid growing speculation that the first country to quit the European Union might be Britain. As Peter Ehrlich of FT Deutschland reminds us this morning, there was chat about a possible Brexit during last week's summit in Brussels: The Wall Street Journal's Simon Nixon has written about this today, warning that the PM's flip-flopping over Europe leaves him \"at the mercy of European events\". Here's a flavour: In recent public statements, Mr. Cameron has indicated he understands the importance of EU membership and his responsibility to defend it. In 10 Downing St., his advisers are not only discussing whether to hold a referendum but also how to win one, says a senior minister involved in the plans. But the weakness of his political position means he cannot rule out leading a campaign to take the U.K. out of the EU if his renegotiation demands are not met. That puts him in a perilous situation. His hopes for a successful renegotiation rest largely on the belief that the euro zone's only hope of survival lies in full political union and the mutualization of debts. But this may be a miscalculation: Much of the fiscal and banking union needed to resolve the crisis are already in place and much of what remains to be done can probably be done within existing treaties, as it was with the fiscal pact. Even if Mr. Cameron had a radical agenda, the rest of the EU may see no need to indulge him\u2014particularly if, as last December, no U.K. interests are at stake. Cameron's misfortune/strategic blunder is to be trapped between two formidable obstacles. On one flank (the right, presumably) the Conservative Party's eurosceptics. On the other, a European establishment which is more concerned with saving the single currency than helping the Brits backpedal. Political developments in Greece this morning, where an MP has been slung out out the ruling coalition. Nikos Stavrogiannis was expelled from New Democracy's parliamentary group after he declared on Sunday that he might not support the country's new austerity programme when it comes before parliament. Stavrogiannis said the measure being imposed by the Troika are \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cineffective\u201d. The intervention prompted Antonis Samaras to throw him out of ND. This still leaves Samaras with a solid majority in parliament. However, there is also chatter that another general electioncould be needed. The leader of the far-right Independent Greeks party, Panos Kammenos, has suggested that his MPs and those of the left-wing SYRIZA party should resign on masse - ahead of a vote on austerity. Kammenos said (via Kathimerini): We will fight this battle in and outside Parliament. But we can stop the measures as well as the country's and the Greek people's surrender, by triggering elections. A bleak set of Japanese export numbers have given further proof this morning that the eurozone crisis is hitting the global economy, Japan's trade deficit widened to 558.6bn yen (or \u00a34.5bn) in September as exports plunged by 10.3%. Much of the damage was caused by a drop in demand for Japanese manufactured goods from Europe, with European exports plummeting by 26% (other factors included the territorial row with China, and the impact of the strong yen on all exports). More here. This article on FT Alphaville is a great explanation of Ireland's banking debt problem: Q&amp;A: Irish promises and promissory notes. (It's seven months old, but Ireland has made little headway in its pursuit of a better deal since March, so still very relevant) Speaking of the FT, its Brussels bureau chief Peter Spiegel is somewhat baffled by Merkel's apparent change of heart over Ireland: Irish politicians have hit the airwaves to welcome Angela Merkel's show of support: The Irish media are celebrating the joint statement issued last night by Ireland and Germany over the Irish banking problem (see 8.12am) It's front-page news on several Irish newspapers, as these tweets from Chris Donoghue, presenter on Ireland's Newstalk Breakfast, show: The Irish Independent argues that Kenny has proved that he has a special bond with Merkel -- a valuable commodity. Ireland is likely to be the first eurozone country to escape its bailout (despite the burden of carrying its banking bailout). That, Dublin insiders believe, gives it an advantage. Ireland's ability to be the first troubled eurozone country to come out of a bailout is also seen as an advantage in negotiations. On government source said told the Irish Independent: Ireland can be the success story Europe needs. The only realistic prospect of a country getting out of a programme is Ireland....But until Spain settles down, they don't want to do anything that is setting a precedent. More on Spain shortly.... Angela Merkel has also threatened to cancel the next big European Summit unless David Cameron, the UK prime minister, drops his threat to veto the next EU budget. Tension between the German and British governments are rising, following Friday's EU summit -- where Cameron pledged to block any new deal on the EU budget that did not include a freeze on spending. Merkel is not amused. The chancellor is now threatening to cancel the entire EC summit scheduled for November if the British insist on taking such as hard line. The Financial Times reports: Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor, does not believe there is any point in holding the budget summit to agree on a seven-year framework for EU spending if Britain intends to veto any deal, say people close to the negotiations. Merkel hopes to get Cameron to agree to her compromise of a budget of just 1% of EU GDP (less than the 1.1% of GDP that the Commission is eying up). Cameron's pledge to block any increase at this time of financial belt-tightening may win him votes at home, but European allies aren't impressed. As one German source told the FT: We are trying to show the UK that they have in us an honest partner. Cameron's position, though, is uncompromising -- No Increase In Spending. His government isn't exactly a stranger to u-turns, but he may feel he can't afford to be beaten on this issue (at at time when Britain is pushing to repatriate a raft of powers). So if Cameron insists on waving his veto, Merkel's threat to veto the entire summit may not be an empty threat. Trouble ahead... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis - and other key events in the world economy. The fallout from last week's EU summit is dominating the headlines this morning. First up, Angela Merkel has offered Ireland an olive branch, promising last night that the eurozone remains committed to addressing its bank debts. After a weekend of diplomatic wrangling, Merkel and Taoiseach Enda Kenny issued a joint statement insisting that the EU leaders would not abandon Ireland. This comes after Merkel appeared to deliver a nasty blow to Dublin last Friday, by saying that legacy bad bank debts will not be covered by the eurozone's new banking supervisor. That prompted outrage in Ireland, where there is simmering anger that it is paying hefty interest payments on its \u20ac68bn banking bailout while Spain (for example) is being offered help recapitalising its own banks. Here's the statement that was issued last night: The Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke together this afternoon...They discussed the unique circumstances behind Ireland's banking and sovereign debt crisis, and Ireland's plans for a full return to the markets. In this regard they reaffirmed the commitment from June 29th to task the Eurogroup to examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to further improving the sustainability of the well performing adjustment programme. They recognise in this context, that Ireland is a special case, and that the Eurogroup will take that into account. End. Ireland, as you may know, took its bad bank debts onto the public books -- arguably saving the eurozone from heavy losses but leaving the taxpayer with the cost of repaying \u20ac31bn in promissory notes, at a much higher interest rate than a straight bailout. It feels unfair. Dubllin is still some way from an actual deal. but this feels like a victory for Kenny -- who had been blasted by opposition leaders for apparently caving into Merkel. We'll be tracking the reaction to the developments in Ireland today, as well as reporting on all the major economic &amp; financial developments across the eurozone crisis, and beyond....",

      "bodyText": "Executives from troubled Kingfisher Airlines, run by the Indian tycoon Vijay Mallya, have met employees to try to thrash out a deal over the seven months of pay they are owed as a first step to getting planes airborne again. Controlled by the flamboyant Mallya \u2013 the 56-year-old self-styled \"King of Good Times\" \u2013 Kingfisher's fleet has been grounded since the start of the month when a staff protest turned violent. Its licence was suspended on Saturday after it failed to address the Indian regulator's concerns about its operations, forcing the debt-laden carrier to stop taking bookings. According to local press reports, the company's 6,500 staff were offered one month's pay immediately, another after three working days and a third after the major festival of Diwali in the first week of November. Kingfisher refused to comment on Monday's meeting, which was described as \"inconclusive\" in the local media. Launched in 2005, Kingfisher Airlines was intended to break the mould of Indian air travel by being glamorous, good-looking, efficient and fun. Mallya featured in the carrier's in-flight videos, welcoming passengers and boasting in a characteristic plummy drawl of \"personally picking\" cabin staff and instructing them to treat passengers \"as if you were a guest in my own home\". Mallya, who inherited the United Breweries conglomerate from his father, epitomised the new breed of Indian businessman: confident, exuberant, exhibitionist and extremely wealthy. He lives in a vast seaside palace in Goa and sits in parliament as an independent senator. The troubles of Kingfisher have contributed to a broader realisation in India that years of explosive economic growth are coming to an end. Recent forecasts have put growth in GDP for this year at between 5% and 6%, dropping from 7% last year, and having hit 9.5% in 2010. There has been much local criticism of Mallya. The Times of India newspaper accused the tycoon of leaving his employees \"in the lurch\" as the airline ran into problems. The launch of a promotional video covering the search for models for the Kingfisher annual calendar by the tycoon's son also provoked an angry response. The airline has never made a profit since being established in 2003 and owes more than \u00a31bn. It will only have its licence reinstated if it provides a plan that satisfies the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). A complete cancellation of the licence was unlikely, said a government source, who declined to be named. The suspension signalled the regulator's lack of patience with Kingfisher after months of cancelled flights and staff walkouts, and marked a rare instance of the government taking a tough stance with a high-profile company. \"The actual position is not changed because of this order,\" Kingfisher said in a statement this weekend. \"We have, in any case, always maintained that once the issues with the employees are resolved, we will first present our resumption plan to DGCA for review, before resuming operations.\" Indian passengers have already been hit by price hikes for domestic travel of up to 50%. Though demand remains high, cut-throat competition and high fuel prices have caused problems for many Indian carriers with only one posting a profit. Analysts have said Kingfisher needs an infusion of at least $1bn (\u00a3625m) to stay afloat. Many of its debts are to public institutions such as the State Bank of India. A recent move by the government to allow greater investment in domestic airlines from overseas has come too late to help the company, analysts said. Later this week Mallya's Formula One team, Sahara Force India, will race in the country's second grand prix. The tycoon and Dutch businessman Michiel Mol bought the Spyker F1 team for \u20ac90m (\u00a375m) in 2007.",

      "bodyText": "The maker of London's black cabs has fallen into administration, putting almost 300 British jobs at risk. Manganese Bronze, which has been making black cabs since 1948, said talks with various parties to secure last-minute rescue funds had ended in failure. The company \u2013 which manufactures the cabs in China \u2013 employs 288 people in Coventry. It is expected to call in administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers. Manganese was locked in emergency talks with executives from Geely, the Chinese carmaker, over the weekend in an attempt to secure a bailout. Geely already owns 20% of the company but negotiations broke down and Manganese said the two could not agree on \"acceptable\" terms. Manganese's chief executive, John Russell, had said the group needed several million pounds a month to stay afloat. Manganese said on Monday it remained hopeful that \"its global reputation will provide the platform for a successful business in the future\". The black cab maker has had a disastrous 12 months. Earlier this month it was forced to recall 400 black cabs after discovering a steering fault. It also suspended its shares and warned its financial position would be \"unclear\" until it had found a way to fix the fault. This summer Manganese enjoyed a spectacular piece of marketing at the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games, when the Spice Girls danced on top of five black cabs, but the glow was shortlived as the company revealed a \u00a33.9m black hole in its accounts just days later, forcing a delay to its half-year results. They were eventually released a fortnight ago, to show the group generated a pre-tax loss of \u00a33.6m for the first half of 2012. Sales dropped 11% to \u00a334.3m. A former British success story, Manganese has failed to turn a profit since 2007. The company has faced growing competition after cab drivers were given permission to use the Mercedes Vito, breaking Manganese's monopoly. Japanese carmaker Nissan is also working on a version of the black cab. Manganese shares \u2013 which were suspended at 10p, valuing the company at just \u00a33m \u2013 have fallen 70% in the past year. Just five years ago, they were changing hands at more than 800p each.",

      "body": "<p>The maker of London's black cabs has fallen into administration, putting almost 300 British jobs at risk.</p> <p>Manganese Bronze, which has been making black cabs since 1948, said talks with various parties to secure last-minute rescue funds had ended in failure. The company \u2013 which manufactures the cabs in China \u2013 employs 288 people in Coventry. It is expected to call in administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p> <p>Manganese was locked in emergency talks with executives from Geely, the Chinese carmaker, over the weekend in an attempt to secure a bailout. Geely already owns 20% of the company but negotiations broke down and Manganese said the two could not agree on \"acceptable\" terms. Manganese's chief executive, John Russell, had said the group needed several million pounds a month to stay afloat.</p> <p>Manganese said on Monday it remained hopeful that \"its global reputation will provide the platform for a successful business in the future\".</p> <p>The black cab maker has had a disastrous 12 months. Earlier this month it was forced to recall 400 black cabs after discovering a steering fault. It also suspended its shares and warned its financial position would be \"unclear\" until it had found a way to fix the fault.</p> <p>This summer Manganese enjoyed a spectacular piece of marketing at the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games, when the Spice Girls danced on top of five black cabs, but the glow was shortlived as the company revealed a \u00a33.9m black hole in its accounts just days later, forcing a delay to its half-year results.</p> <p>They were eventually released a fortnight ago, to show the group generated a pre-tax loss of \u00a33.6m for the first half of 2012. Sales dropped 11% to \u00a334.3m.</p> <p>A former British success story, Manganese has failed to turn a profit since 2007. The company has faced growing competition after cab drivers were given permission to use the Mercedes Vito, breaking Manganese's monopoly. Japanese carmaker Nissan is also working on a version of the black cab.</p> <p>Manganese shares \u2013 which were suspended at 10p, valuing the company at just \u00a33m \u2013 have fallen 70% in the past year. Just five years ago, they were changing hands at more than 800p each.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Japan's trade deficit widened in September as exports plunged 10.3% from a year earlier, weighed down by the high yen, Europe's debt crisis and a row with China that has damaged close economic ties. The deficit for the month was \u00a5558.6bn (\u00a34.5bn), the finance ministry said on Monday, higher than the forecasts of many analysts and bigger than a deficit of about \u00a32.3bn a year earlier. The deficit in August was \u00a36bn. Without a swift reversal in fortunes, Japan is likely to register its second annual trade deficit in more than 30 years, embarrassing its leaders and illustrating the difficulties for major exporting economies in a period of low global growth. Some analysts said the row with China was the most important factor holding back exports after a boycott of cars and other Japanese goods in the escalating battle over the Senkaku islands. Beijing is accused of stoking xenophobic protests over the islands, which it has claimed since the 1970s despite a settlement following the second world war that handed them to Japan. Protests in September across the communist-run country spilled over into violence against Japanese-owned factories and shops after Tokyo purchased the islands from a private owner. It is understood that Japanese companies have reacted to boycotts of their goods by cancelling plans for investments in factories and equipment in their Chinese subsidiaries. The stand-off between the world's second and third largest economies has the potential to hit international trade and slow the world economy further, unless China's new leaders, who are due to be unveiled next month, take steps to open diplomatic channels. Tokyo has shrugged off the financial impact of the deficit, which is offset by decades of surpluses. Central bank governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, told a quarterly meeting of the bank's regional managers the economy was \"levelling off\". However, the figures indicate the difficulties faced by major exporters after a \"lost\" two decades of low growth following the property bubble shock that wrecked Japan's banking system in the late 1980s. Shirakawa warned that the risk of shocks to the financial system from the debt crisis in Europe remained high and slowing global growth was hitting manufacturing and exports. Matthew Circosta, an economist with Moody's Analytics in Sydney, said with the risk of recession rising, the Bank of Japan needs to convince markets that it will do anything necessary to pull the economy out of its two-decade-old malaise. The central banks has refrained so far from copying the huge injections of funds undertaken by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to stimulate demand. Instead of sporadic monetary easing, \"they need to make it sustained and powerful\", he said. \"They've just got to be more aggressive than they are now.\" Many expect the central bank to opt for further easing soon, perhaps as early as the next board meeting on 30 October. September's exports totalled \u00a55.4 trillion. Imports rose 4% from a year earlier to \u00a55.9tn, inflated by additional imports of oil and other fuels for power generation as most nuclear reactors remain offline after last year's Fukushima nuclear disaster. So far, Japan's trade deficit for 2012, according to the ministry's provisional figures, is about \u00a54.73tn. The ministry figures show exports to all regions falling, apart from a meagre 0.4% year-on-year gain in shipments to North America. Exports to crisis-stricken Europe plummeted 26%. The dispute with China took a heavy toll, with exports to China sinking 14% from a year earlier to \u00a5953.4bn. Imports from China climbed 3.8% to \u00a51.28tn. Car exports fell 15% in September from the year before. The strong Japanese yen has hurt the country's export competitiveness, while demand has evaporated as growth slowed in most regions. Exports of consumer electronics, a mainstay, fell by double-digit figures from a year earlier. Resource-scarce Japan is almost entirely dependent on imported fuel, and it has long relied on robust exports of high-value consumer goods and industrial products, such as machine tools, to help counter the cost of importing its energy needs. With most of the country's nuclear plants shut down, manufacturers and utilities have increased their reliance on traditional energy sources, such as oil and gas, while stepping up conservation and investments in renewable energy. Boosted partly by higher prices, imports of fuels jumped 18% in September from a year earlier to \u00a52.15tn, accounting for more than a third of Japan's total imports.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Asos</strong>, the online fashion retailer, is in demand with investors ahead of its half year results on Thursday.</p> <p>Part of the interest came from weekend reports that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/9623143/Amazon-weighs-bid-for-online-fashion-retailer-Asos.html\" title=\"\">Amazon had cast its eye over Asos</a>, not the first time this suggestion has been made. Analyst Nick Bubb commented:</p> <blockquote> With the market cap of Asos now up to \u00a32bn, mighty Amazon has left it a bit late to start looking at the business (unless money is simply no object), but whatever happens the 27% stake in Asos built up by the Danish fashion group Bestseller is looking cannier by the day, given the likelihood that Asos will soon start to crack the Chinese market. </blockquote> <p>At the same time Investec, in a note on clothing retailers, repeated its buy recommendation on the business. Analyst Bethany Hocking said:</p> <blockquote> In our view the share price is likely to benefit from positive sentiment over the next few months as the market continues to appreciate the significance to earnings of new in-country warehouses. We also think that it is positive that the company has already started to discuss (and thus clearly plan internally) the establishments of new warehouses, reducing the implementation risk, in our opinion. <br> We remain buyers, albeit caution that we see potential for the shares to consolidate between 2500p and 2700p near-term. </blockquote> <p>Asos has added 43p to \u00a324.80 but <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong>, tipped as a sell by Investec, is down 1.3p to 391.8p.

      "bodyText": "Asos, the online fashion retailer, is in demand with investors ahead of its half year results on Thursday. Part of the interest came from weekend reports that Amazon had cast its eye over Asos, not the first time this suggestion has been made. Analyst Nick Bubb commented: With the market cap of Asos now up to \u00a32bn, mighty Amazon has left it a bit late to start looking at the business (unless money is simply no object), but whatever happens the 27% stake in Asos built up by the Danish fashion group Bestseller is looking cannier by the day, given the likelihood that Asos will soon start to crack the Chinese market. At the same time Investec, in a note on clothing retailers, repeated its buy recommendation on the business. Analyst Bethany Hocking said: In our view the share price is likely to benefit from positive sentiment over the next few months as the market continues to appreciate the significance to earnings of new in-country warehouses. We also think that it is positive that the company has already started to discuss (and thus clearly plan internally) the establishments of new warehouses, reducing the implementation risk, in our opinion. We remain buyers, albeit caution that we see potential for the shares to consolidate between 2500p and 2700p near-term. Asos has added 43p to \u00a324.80 but Marks &amp; Spencer, tipped as a sell by Investec, is down 1.3p to 391.8p.

Igor Shuvalov, Russia's deputy prime minister, has said that the government would consider further privatisation in an attempt to soothe any concerns among BP investors about the influence of the Kremlin over such a crucial part of the UK oil firm whose share price is yet to recover from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the US in April 2010. BP gets a quarter of its production from the existing Russian venture.</p> <p>Dudley's Rosneft counterpart, Igor Sechin, is a former spy who flew to London last week to take control of the long-running negotiations and whose company has long been attractive to BP. In January 2011 BP and Rosneft announced a share swap to enable them to explore in the Russian Arctic until AAR blocked the transaction. BP's technical expertise is likely to be essential if the Russian Arctic is to be explored, although this is likely to anger environmental campaigners. BP is also keen to get more expertise from Russia, a market which produces 10m barrels of crude oil every day, and is considering whether to appoint a Russian national to its board. An announcement on the identity of any new board members is not thought to be imminent.</p>",

With the City expecting an announcement early this week, the UK-based company said in a holding statement on Monday: \"BP confirms it is in advanced discussions with Rosneft regarding the sale of its 50% interest in TNK-BP. No agreement has yet been reached. A further announcement will be made if and when an agreement is reached.\" Under the terms Rosneft is likely to become the biggest stock market-listed oil company in the world, while BP will become the second biggest investor in the company after the Russian state. BP is expected to end up with a stake of as much as 20% in Rosneft, securing a major presence in the world's biggest oil and gas province, and taking at least one seat on the board of the company which is led by an ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The transaction is crucial to BP as it provides an exit from the TNK-BP venture which has posed a series of difficulties for the firm, including the departure of Bob Dudley from Russia in 2008 when he was head of the venture. It has required $8bn of investment by BP which in turn has taken out $19bn in dividends. Dudley, now chief executive of BP, has told his board that he backs the cash and share deal for the 50% TNK-BP stake, which will eventually allow him to hand out billions to BP shareholders. Rosneft is expected to buy out the other half of the TNK-BP joint venture from the local oligarchs known as AAR, which had previously prevented BP from taking a larger stake in Rosneft. BP will receive $10bn-$14bn in cash from Rosneft and take shares in the Russian company in which it already owns a 1.25% stake after the partial sell-off in 2006. While there has been speculation that the Kremlin will reduce its stake in Rosneft to as low as 50% plus one share, this is yet to happen. Igor Shuvalov, Russia's deputy prime minister, has said that the government would consider further privatisation in an attempt to soothe any concerns among BP investors about the influence of the Kremlin over such a crucial part of the UK oil firm whose share price is yet to recover from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the US in April 2010. BP gets a quarter of its production from the existing Russian venture. Dudley's Rosneft counterpart, Igor Sechin, is a former spy who flew to London last week to take control of the long-running negotiations and whose company has long been attractive to BP. In January 2011 BP and Rosneft announced a share swap to enable them to explore in the Russian Arctic until AAR blocked the transaction. BP's technical expertise is likely to be essential if the Russian Arctic is to be explored, although this is likely to anger environmental campaigners. BP is also keen to get more expertise from Russia, a market which produces 10m barrels of crude oil every day, and is considering whether to appoint a Russian national to its board. An announcement on the identity of any new board members is not thought to be imminent.",
