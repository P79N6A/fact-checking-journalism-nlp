      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s how the City\u2019s drinking dens hailed the election: \u201cEuphoria returns to the City! Lobster Thermidor is back on the menu! Buy shares in lap dancing bars! The City is safe for five years.\u201d Roll on 2020..... Anyway that\u2019s enough from me, after another busy week. Goodnight,and thanks as ever. GW But behind the numbers on the Footsie, fears of political instability are growing - over Scotland, over the strength of the domestic union, and the European union. Over to Reuters. \u201cA good general election result for the UK economy, but not a good day for the United Kingdom,\u201d said Richard Buxton, head of UK Equities at Old Mutual Global Investors in London. \u201cThe scale of the SNP\u2019s victory in Scotland, together with the scale of UKIP\u2019s share of the national vote, at over 12 percent, confirms the extent to which we are an increasingly divided nation.\u201d The populist UK Independence Party, which favours withdrawal from the EU, surged into third place in the countrywide vote tally, although that translated into only a single seat. Nigel Green, chief executive of deVere Group, said the rally in sterling, shares and bonds might be the calm before the storm, and advised clients to hedge themselves against a fall in the value of these assets due to political uncertainty. \u201cThe prospect of an in-out referendum of Britain\u2019s EU membership has gone from risk to a reality,\u201d Green said. The pound has clung on to its gains of 21 hours ago when exit polls sent shockwaves through British politics. Sterling is still up 1.5% against the US dollar, at $1.547. It\u2019s a similar story against the euro, the pound has gained over two cents at \u20ac1.377. There was no late twist in the City tonight. Investors stuck with their initial gut view that the Conservative\u2019s crushing victory was bullish for stocks. They drove shares in swathes of companies higher, once it was clear that Labour policies such as energy price freezes, rent controls or higher bank levies were all off the table. Babcock, the engineering firm with a role in Trident, jumped by 9%. Centrica gained 8%, Royal Bank of Scotland rose by 6%, and Lloyds Banking Group wasn\u2019t far behind. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares finished the day up 2.3%, or 159 points, at 7,046, its biggest rise sine January. Fewer controls from the government may mean more profits for shareholders. But today\u2019s rally also reflects relief that Britain won\u2019t see weeks of political wrangling. Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, dubs it \u201cfabulous Friday for the UK stock market.\u201d Within that there are certain sectors which have done particularly well, as investors have reassessed their prospects in light of a Conservative majority administration. Energy companies, house-builders, out-sourcing companies and banks have all seen big gains today, as the market views Conservative policies as better for these businesses. Will these policies be better for consumers, though? We\u2019ve got five years to find out.... No change at the top of the Treasury, with George Osborne being reappointed as chancellor of the exchequer. Osborne has also been named as the highest-ranged minister in David Cameron\u2019s cabinet. Here\u2019s some post-election analysis from UBS Wealth Management: A Conservative government will continue on the path of deficit reduction, erasing concerns about the fiscal outlook which should support the gilt market An EU referendum is all but guaranteed now, giving an additional layer of uncertainty to the outlook. Markets will be watching carefully the pressure emanating from Tory backbenchers to take a more aggressive approach to the EU The dominant performance of the SNP will lead to further calls for devolution. Full fiscal autonomy cannot be ruled out, which could raise additional questions about the UK\u2019s fiscal position over the medium term, as well as the path to English devolution. With the threat of a price freeze behind it, Centrica says it welcomes the \u201ccertainty\u201d of today\u2019s result. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets sums up today\u2019s stock market action: Markets breathed a sigh of relief at the continuity of a Conservative government and the reduced threat of the Scottish National Party destabilising the union through a coalition with the Labour party. The sectors within the UK stock market that were most exposed to some of the interventions planned in The Labour Party manifesto were those that jumped the most on the Conservative win. No price caps or suggestion of breakup of the major utilities companies meant Centrica was the top riser. No rent cap or mansion tax sent homebuilders including Barratt Developments and estate agent Foxtons soaring. Banks were all trading significantly higher as chances of the bank levy increasing were reduced. Transport companies including Stagecoach saw some big gains with the threat of partial nationalisation gone. Time for a brief recap. Britain\u2019s stock market has surged today as investors welcomed the Conservative Party\u2019s shock victory in yesterday\u2019s general election. The FTSE 100 has romped up by 2%, or 135 points, to 7021, led by companies who would have faced tougher regulation by a Labour administration. And the pound is still clinging onto last night\u2019s gains after exit polls showed a shock Tory majority. Dominic Bryant, UK economist at BNP Paribas, provides a handy summary: The Conservatives look to have won an unexpected majority in the UK general election. The majority will, however, be thin. The Scottish National Party won 56 of 59 Scottish seats. Labour and the Liberal Democrats were the big losers. The Labour Party is likely to have lost around 25 seats relative to 2010, while the Conservatives seem to have gained 20-plus seats. Markets took the news positively, with the currency, equities and bonds all rallying. The clarity of the outcome is important, as it could have been far messier. This likely reflects a relief rally over a much clearer result than expected and a view that the Conservatives will run with more business-friendly policies. This news story by Jill Treanor tells the full picture: But two issues loom over the markets. The first is Scotland, with the SNP holding all-but three seats. As Jeremy Cook of World First explained: Nicola Sturgeon must decide what she does with her seats. Does she build a left-unity coalition, or keep banging the independence drum? The second is Europe; with David Cameron confirming a few minutes ago that he will offer an in-out referendum. Rating agency Moody\u2019s has warned that it could hurt the UK economy, and potentially hit the country\u2019s credit rating. Property companies are particularly upbeat, with Sotheby\u2019s reporting a surge in interest from overseas buyers now there\u2019s no chance of a mansion tax soon. Other European leaders are now bracing for two years of gruelling negotiations over Britain\u2019s future in the European Union, reports our Brussels reporter Ian Traynor. European Council president Donald Tusk has issued a warning to Downing Street too; saying he\u2019s counting on David Cameron to argue for Britain to stay in Europe. Cameron also confirms he will hold the in-out referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union which he promised. David Cameron is speaking outside Downing Street now, confirming he will form a majority Conservative government. Our main General Election liveblog has all the details: Mark Boleat, Policy Chairman for the City of London Corporation, has fired a clear warning at the new government not to damage London\u2019s businesses by risking a Brexit. \u201cWhat the Square Mile\u2019s firms wanted to see was a Government that brings stability and certainty to the world of business. The City stands ready to support the new Government. \u201cAt the top of the in-tray in the coming weeks and months will be the issue of the UK\u2019s position in Europe. The business view is clear \u2013 Britain needs to be in the EU. The higher the perceived chance of Britain leaving the EU, the more damage there will be to investment in Britain. Reform would be good but we must work hard to articulate what that reform should look like. Here\u2019s another warning about the risks of Britain crashing out of the EU, from the director-general of the CBI, John Cridland: \u201cWith an EU referendum now likely, business will now want to see an ambitious, achievable reform agenda that will make both the UK and Europe more competitive and prosperous for all. The majority of businesses want to stay in a reformed European Union which opens up the world\u2019s largest market of 500 million consumers.\u201d But big questions remain about David Cameron\u2019s ability to get such reform, with Brussels unwilling to open up EU treaties (partly because everyone would want a piece of the action). The pound has now gained ground against every rival foreign currency today: Philip Shaw of Investec has joined the ranks of experts warning that a Brexit referendum could spook the financial markets: Once the dust has settled on the shocks and surprises of the 7 May General Election, there are a number of questions still to be answered. One other issue, we would also remind readers of is that the Conservatives have promised to hold a referendum on the UK\u2019s EU membership by end-2017. Although this is far enough down the line to not worry markets at this point, much like the Scottish independence referendum of September-2014, this could become a major market issue as we approach the poll. Credit rating agency Moody\u2019s has warned that a referendum over Britain\u2019s European future could hurt the economy, and trigger a downgrade. Kathrin Muehlbronner, Vice President-Senior Credit Officer at Moody\u2019s, says: \u201cWhile the election result will have no impact on the UK\u2019s rating, if the Conservative Party\u2019s plan to hold a referendum on European Union membership results in the UK\u2019s exit this could have consequences for the whole economy, including potentially for the sovereign rating, if the UK was unable to broadly replicate the benefits of membership.\u201d David Cameron has promised an \u201cin/out\u201d referendum on British membership of the European Union in 2017; a pledge his backbenchers will surely hold him to. https://twitter.com/pressassoc/status/596637791183904769 The good news for the PM (who just arrived at Buckingham Palace) is that Britain\u2019s economic prospects look brighter, Muehlbronner adds: \u201cThe outlook for the country\u2019s public finances has improved irrespective of the government\u2019s composition: following several years of very subdued real GDP growth, growth accelerated significantly in 2014. We expect the economy to continue to expand at rates above 2% for the next several years, as the effects of the financial crisis fade.\u201d It\u2019s been another extremely busy morning on London\u2019s stock market. BATS Chi-X Europe, the stock exchange, repots that nearly \u20ac4.2bn-worth of FTSE100 stocks were traded between 8am and 10pm. That\u2019s a third of yesterday\u2019s FTSE100 total. Thursday was twice as busy as usual across Europe\u2019s stock markets, and Friday\u2019s is looking at least as hectic. BATS says: If value traded stays at this pace over the day \u2013 and if bond markets put in another similar performance - total \u20ac traded across Europe by 4.30 p.m. could exceed yesterday. Some economists reckon that the election result could mean interest rates could remain at record lows for longer. The logic is that the Bank of England will feel less need to hike borrowing costs if George Osborne is implementing tougher fiscal policy in the Treasury. David Page, senior economist at AXA IM, explains: A modestly softer growth outlook and tightening fiscal stance suggests the MPC will not feel rushed into tightening monetary policy. Britain\u2019s bankers reckon the election result is \u2018good news\u2019 for the economy (it\u2019s certainly good news for bankers who didn\u2019t fancy paying 50% income tax): BRITISH BANKERS ASSOCIATION CEO SAYS CLEAR ELECTION RESULT IS GOOD NEWS FOR BRITAIN AND FOR ECONOMY BBA CEO SAYS NEW GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT UK BANKING REMAINS GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE BBA CEO SAYS INDUSTRY WILL LOOK TO WORK WITH NEW GOVERNMENT IN A CONSTRUCTIVE MANNER Shares are still buoyant in London, but they might slide once investors ponder the prospect of a referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership. John Wyn-Evans, head of investment strategy at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, has sounded a note of caution: The markets\u2019 reaction to the result has been predictably positive, with the pound being the initial beneficiary. Gilt yields have also fallen on the prospect of more austerity and a lower deficit while shares are rising, unsurprisingly led by house builders, domestic retail banks and regulated utilities and outsourcing companies. To put things into perspective, though, that still leaves the index below where it was a week last Tuesday. \u201cHowever, without wishing to throw too much cold water on the celebrations, we will return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d very shortly, and there is the small matter of a promised referendum on membership of Europe to negotiate. The sight of David Cameron heading back into Downing Street has sparked a flurry of interest from wealthy foreigners looking to buy a multi-million pound house in London. That\u2019s according to Michelle van Vuuren, Managing Director of Residential Development at Sotheby\u2019s International Realty UK. She says: \u201cA Conservative victory \u2013 whether outright or otherwise \u2013 will give the housing market what it wants: stability. The removal of the uncertainty that has clouded the last year of the Coalition will allow developers to plan confidently for the medium term with a consistent economic policy. Having said that, we do hope to see the Tories come good on their annual pledge of 200,000 new homes and freeing up Brownfield sites for development. Increasing the supply of homes is the only way to truly overcome the hurdles that the housing market places for the majority of buyers. At the top end \u2013 for the next five years at least \u2013 a cessation of the clamour for a Mansion Tax will see a number of transactions that have stalled to come back on line as certitude creeps back into the market. It is going to be an exciting time to be in the London market over the Summer! We are already taking calls from international buyers who want to get back into the market.\u201d  No wonder Foxton\u2019s share price spiked this morning. But I fear it won\u2019t be a very exciting time for those workers trying to get onto the property ladder, though, or for renters who had hoped a Labour government might protect them from rising living costs. Another sign that expensive houses are going to get even pricier Two property firms have just rushed out statements, predicting that the top end of Britain\u2019s housing market will benefit from the Conservative victory. Lucian Cook, Savills UK head of residential research, says: With an effective Conservative majority, or Conservative-led coalition now looking like the most likely result, we expect much of the deferred demand from the pre-election period to flow back into the prime market over the remainder of 2015 and 2016, particularly given that the spectre of a mansion tax is now removed from the market. Countrywide\u2019s CEO Alison Platt also reckons that the most expensive houses will be in demand. Greenbelt land could be under threat too. \u201cWe now expect there to be greater activity in the housing market, especially in the \u00a32 million plus markets facing the prospect of a Mansion Tax. \u201cWe anticipate this Conservative led Government to turn its attention from implementing policies that stimulated demand in the housing market to addressing the lack of housing supply. Sticking to its pledge to boost housebuilding through the provision of more affordable housing and more garden cities should prove welcome. \u201cThe new Government could take this a step further by reviewing precisely what we call Greenbelt today and look to free up more land for sustainable development. Champagne corks may be popping in the City this lunchtime, but when investors sober up they may remember that Britain faces several serious challenges. The first is the unbalanced state of the UK economy. A budget deficit of 5% of national income is matched by a similar-sized balance of payments deficit, which reflects the fact that Britain consistently imports more than it exports. A fall in sterling will be needed to close the trade gap, and there will need to be a shift in economic focus from consumer spending to investment and manufacturing. The second factor is politics. Conservative strategists will already be thinking about how to win again in 2020, and the best way of doing that is to get the economic and political cycles aligned. In broad terms, that means getting any bad news out of the way as quickly as possible. Specifically, it means the Government will want to front-load austerity in the hope that healthier public finances will permit tax cuts from the middle of the parliament onwards. This strategy resulted in a sharp slowdown in growth in the first two years of the 2010-15 parliament, but given the election result, the Conservatives will be minded to adopt the same approach a second time. The third factor is the possibility that Britain might vote to leave the European Union in the referendum that will now take place in 2017..... More here: Vince Cable\u2019s defeat means Britain is certain to get a new secretary of state for Business, Innovation and Skills. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, is hoping for a \u201creally big hitter\u201d to tackle the UK\u2019s long-term problems: He or she will have an in-tray which will include the need to tackle some of the issues which will help Britain embed and build on the recovery. These include reversing the trade deficit, tackling an energy policy which remains a mess and redoubling efforts to deal with a creaking infrastructure by getting on with important projects, especially building a new airport hub. Here\u2019s today\u2019s City reaction in a garish, pushy nutshell: Foxtons, the upmarket London estate agent, can now keep operating without the prospect of a Mansion tax hitting business. Engineering firm Babcock has rallied by almost 6.5% this morning. Babcock has a big contract to build the next-generation of Trident submarines; analysts feared it was vulnerable if the Scottish Nationalist Party (which wants to scrap Trident) had supported a Labour government. City trading floor have been gripped by the sight of Ed Balls, shadow chancellor, losing his Morley and Outwood seat by 422 votes. Simon Goodley has taken a quick poll of City Index traders. The consensus is that FTSE might trade sideways from here and then a possibly volume spike and price rise if/when a Tory majority is confirmed. There\u2019s also the temptation to bank profits, as Chris Lodge, head of client management at City Index, explains: \u201cClients who bought the FTSE yesterday are taking profits ....If you\u2019ve been gifted 100 points on the FTSE, you\u2019re probably going to pocket that.\u201d \u201cThere are also a number of people buying FTSE this morning, but these are all new positions. The assume that a Tory administration will automatically be good for the economy. That is also why there are a number of buyers of the banks.\u201d Britain\u2019s government debt is also rallying this morning. The yield on 10-year gilts has tumbled to 1.84%, down from almost 2% earlier this week. That means the cost of borrowing has fallen. Nick Serff of City Index explains: \u201cInvestors see the UK as a safe haven again. Gilts are a good place to place their money. The result takes the uncertainty out of it\u201d. The FTSE 250 index of smaller companies has just hit a record high. Bookmaker Ladbrokes are up 10% (Labour had planned a crackdown on betting firms), followed by housebuilder Berkeley Group (+9%) and estate agent Savills (+8%). Nick Serff, senior market maker at City Index, explains why shares are surging this morning: \u201cAfter the global Greek euro concerns we had a snapback yesterday as the markets were oversold. But a potential Conservative majority is a big thing. It\u2019s the certainty it gives to the City. It is the best outcome for the FTSE.\u201d Serff also said that City Index\u2019s clients had done well out of the election too, with \u201cpunters all buying the FTSE yesterday and this morning before the market opened.\u201d There are some stunning moves in the City this morning -- here\u2019s the top risers on the FTSE 100. The FTSE 100 index has surged by 2%, or 148 points, in early trading t0 7028 points as the City welcomes the election result. As expected, banks, energy firms and builders are leading the way. More to follow... Shares have started trading in London, but we\u2019ve not got the full opening price yet -- suggesting some companies are going to surge.. Britain should now brace itself for another bout of austerity. We know that \u00a312bn of cuts are pencilled in; we just don\u2019t know where. As Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics puts it: A Tory victory means that the economy will have to endure a fairly aggressive renewal of the fiscal squeeze. There\u2019s also a danger that business investment could suffer from uncertainty ahead of the referendum on UK membership of the EU, she adds. The Conservatives are now projected to win a wafer-thin majority of two seats. Shares in banks and energy companies are set to jump by over 3% when the stock market opens in 15 minutes time. UK BANK SHARES SEEN UP 3-4 PCT AFTER CONSERVATIVES\u2019 STRONG BRITISH ELECTION RESULT -TRADERS CENTRICA, SSE ALSO SEEN UP 3-5 PCT ON CONSERVATIVES\u2019 STRONG BRITISH ELECTION RESULT -TRADERS Ed Miliband had vowed to freeze energy bills if he won power, and to raise the banking levy by \u00a3800m to fund more childcare for working families. Housebuilding shares are also being called higher. Labour had vowed to impose rent controls if it won power, to prevent landlords raising living costs during a tenancy. I just caught up with Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency exchange firm World First, who pulled an election all-nighter. He explains that the pound jumped because last night\u2019s exit poll was so decisive - showing that the Conservatives might come within 10 seats of a majority. \u201cA majority wasn\u2019t priced in... so everyone has been given a little more certainty than they expected.\u201d But once the initial relief wears off, the financial markets will want to know what happens about Europe, and Scotland. As Cook explains: Nicola Sturgeon must decide what she does with her seats. Does she build a left-unity coalition, or keep banging the independence drum? And he believes the Conservatives must now deliver on their promise on a referendum on EU membership. It was a big issue in rural campaigns, and if David Cameron were to go back on it it would cause a lot of problems with the grass roots. And indeed, the pound has dipped a little in the last few minutes as investors look to the future. The pound is also romping up against the euro, gaining almost 2% to \u20ac1.3794. There\u2019s a real feeling of optimism building in the City. The FTSE is now expected to surge by 120 points, or around 2%. It didn\u2019t take markets long to react to the 10pm exit poll shock: Market analyst Louise Cooper reckons the pound could keep surging as more results come in: This is because as the old mantra goes, \u201cmarkets hate uncertainty\u201d. Cameron has governed for the last five years and investors know what they are getting with Cameron and Osborne. Better the devil you know and all that. Stan Shamu, analyst at IG, explains why the FTSE 100 is going to surge at 8am: With the Conservatives appearing to have gained ground and unexpectedly gaining seats, this seems like it is the market friendly result. It remains to be seen how many additional seats the Conservatives will need from a partner but with the current projections it will be a tiny amount. Election talk is likely to spill over into the weekend and it\u2019ll be interesting to see how long the momentum in the FTSE and sterling can last. My colleagues Claire Phipps and Andrew Sparrow have launched a new live-blog covering the general election aftermath: Shares in London are expected to surge this morning, as City traders digest the news that David Cameron has pulled off an unexpected success. Spread-betting firms are calling the blue-chip FTSE 100 index up around 100 points. Trading begins at 8am. The pound has posted its biggest jump against the US dollar since 2009 , as the election results suggest the Conservative Party has triumphed at the polls. Sterling leapt by 1% when the exit polls were released at 10pm, showing that the Tories could take 316 seats - nearly an overall majority. And as early results confirmed the trend, the pound pushed higher. It has now gained 2 and a half cents to $1.55, a two month high. According to Reuters data, it\u2019s the biggest one-day gain against the US dollar since July 2009. Good morning. The pound is soaring, and shares are set to surge in London, after one of the most unexpected general election results in recent British history. After a dramatic night, David Cameron appears to be heading back to Downing Street, possibly even with a majority; something that looked highly until the exit polls electrified With more than half of constituencies having declared their results, the Conservative party has just inched ahead of Labour, and on track to be the largest party by some distance. It\u2019s a pretty disastrous night for Ed Miliband and Labour, who\u2019ve been wiped out in Scotland and made little progress in England. A bloody one for the Liberal Democrats too. And scores of major political figures have seen their careers grind to a shuddering halt. But Cameron\u2019s success will be cheered by the City of London this morning, as the threat of weeks of coalition horse-trading recedes. I\u2019ll be tracking the financial reaction to the election in this live blog. If you missed the action, you can catch up with Andy Sparrow\u2019s rolling coverage:",

Conservative strategists will already be thinking about how to win again in 2020, and the best way of doing that is to get the economic and political cycles aligned. In broad terms, that means getting any bad news out of the way as quickly as possible. Specifically, it means the Government will want to front-load austerity in the hope that healthier public finances will permit tax cuts from the middle of the parliament onwards.</p> <p>This strategy resulted in a sharp slowdown in growth in the first two years of the 2010-15 parliament, but given the election result, the Conservatives will be minded to adopt the same approach a second time.</p> <p>The third factor is the possibility that Britain might vote to leave the European Union in the referendum that will now take place in 2017.....</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://t.co/LlwLPFT9wo\">More here:</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/_fionawalsh/statuses/596589636916510720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Larry Elliott on why the post-election celebrations in the City may be brief - <a href=\"http://t.co/LlwLPFT9wo\">http://t.co/LlwLPFT9wo</a></p>&mdash;

Full mobile networks are currently changing hands for multiples of seven times profits, but analysts said Tesco Mobile might fetch a multiple of eight or more because the business does not require capital expenditure in broadcast masts and other infrastructure. The venture is a virtual network: it does not own masts, but buys airtime at wholesale rates from O2, which is then resold at a discount to price conscious consumers. \u201cTesco is obviously going through an asset thought process,\u201d said analyst Guy Peddy at Macquarie bank. \u201cIt sold its broadband business, now it\u2019s thinking of selling its mobile business.\u201d In January, TalkTalk swooped on Tesco\u2019s broadband business, having already secured its pay-per-view movie service Blinkbox. The company is also seen as a contender for the mobile arm. Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, is under pressure to cut costs and sell off businesses in order to pay down some of its \u00a321.7bn in debts, including lease commitments and its pension deficit. Ratings agencies have cut the retailer\u2019s debt to junk status as profits and sales have slumped in the face of a supermarket price war kicked off by the rise of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Tesco dived to a \u00a36.4bn statutory loss, before tax, in the year to 28 February and underlying profits, which exclude one-off items such as property writedowns, now sit at just \u00a3961m. The company has already sold off its fleet of corporate jets and a music streaming service to Guvera. It\u2019s also in the process of marketing Dunhumby, the analysis firm behind the Tesco Clubcard, for a rumoured \u00a32bn. Advertising agency WPP is among the bidders. Launched in 2003, Tesco mobile operates in a crowded market. BT is moving into mobile, TalkTalk has a thriving virtual network, using airtime rented from O2, and Sky is planning to enter the business next year, also in partnership with O2. Meanwhile, margins are being squeezed. Virtual networks made money from reselling voice calls and text messages at cheaper rates than network operators, but today\u2019s smartphone owners want to use the internet and margins on data are less easy to predict.

    "webTitle": "Tsipras sees 'happy ending' for Greece in crisis talks as \u20ac750m repayment nears", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s embattled prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has insisted he is confident of a resolution to the country\u2019s debt crisis, as his government struggles to meet a \u20ac750m (\u00a3545m) repayment to the International Monetary Fund next week and avoid default. Greece is starved of cash but senior EU officials say there is no prospect of a deal releasing bailout money when the eurozone meets on Monday in Brussels. Tsipras said on Friday: \u201cI am confident that we will soon have a happy ending and that despite the difficulties ... we will carry out the agreement, which will be concluded soon in Europe.\u201d He added that his government was \u201cdoing whatever it should in order to reach ... an honest and mutually beneficial agreement with our partners\u201d. Greece has to pay the \u20ac750m to the IMF next Tuesday and is desperate to free up the \u20ac7.2bn in bailout funds still sitting blocked from its creditors. But while the brinkmanship between Athens and the eurozone has given way to more substantive negotiations recently, both sides are nowhere near a pact that would trade rescue funds for fiscal and economic reforms, a senior EU official said. The Eurogroup of finance ministers from the single currency zone meets in Brussels on Monday to wrestle with the Greek crisis. Stalemate has prevailed since the anti-austerity Tsipras government won power in January promising to defy the eurozone and reverse the terms of five years of austerity, prescribed mainly by Germany. But with time running out on a 30 June deadline for the bailout programme, neither side appears to be blinking. \u201cWe are still quite some way away ... from a final agreement,\u201d said the official. \u201cThere will be no final conclusion on Monday ... I don\u2019t expect a lengthy or contentious debate.\u201d In several days of negotiations last week, the Greeks were said to have made concessions over reform of their complex and confused VAT system, but to have dug in their heels against European demands on wages policy, labour market changes and pension cuts. This week Athens announced it was rehiring civil servants fired as part of public spending cuts enacted by the previous centre-right government under the terms of the bailout. While the Greek authorities are clearly running out of money, the contrasting narratives on both sides of the dispute and the non-stop propaganda make it difficult to determine when the country will run out of money. A failure to pay the IMF on Tuesday would be the start of a default. But Brussels appeared confident and sanguine that Athens would and could make the payment. The eurozone and the IMF have committed to a \u20ac240bn bailout of Greece since 2010 in an attempt to save the single currency from unravelling, but the tail-end of the rescue programme has in effect been frozen since last summer. In February the new Tsipras government agreed to extend the bailout until the end of next month but the eurozone refuses to disburse the remaining funds until Tsipras delivers on a persuasive programme of economic reforms. Non-stop negotiations over the past three months have brought only incremental progress and no release of money, while trust between the Greeks and their creditors has evaporated. Even if the current bailout was satisfactorily completed, the consensus is that Greece will still need a new arrangement with its creditors from July. The national debt has risen, and keeps rising under the bailout regime, to unsustainable levels. The assumption in Brussels is that Tsipras is aiming to get to the end of June without any substantive concessions and then try to merge the status quo into a new agreement, which would be less rigorous, more generous and might include elements of a debt writedown. The eurozone states bluntly, however, that this is not possible. Completion of the current programme review, said the official, was essential for starting negotiations on a gentler new arrangement. He emphasised that there had been no discussion within the Eurogroup about a new Greek programme and said that both sides would need to agree to conclude the current bailout by the end of the month. Otherwise things get \u201cvery, very tight\u201d. Despite the constant scares that Greece will default on its debt repayments and possibly crash out of the euro, there was little sign of nervousness in Brussels. \u201cThey are not flush, awash with cash, but I am confident they will make their upcoming payments,\u201d said the official. \u201cThere has been a significant rapprochement on issues, but no agreement on anything.\u201d Economists at Morgan Stanley warned there was still a significant risk of Greece leaving the eurozone. \u201cThe Eurogroup of finance ministers and the Greek government are unlikely to find an agreement just yet. We think that the funding situation remains critical in Greece, and that the probability of mis-steps potentially leading to capital controls or even euro-exit is high,\u201d they said in a research note.",

      "body": "<p><br>Greece\u2019s embattled prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has insisted he is confident of a resolution to the country\u2019s debt crisis, as his government struggles to meet a \u20ac750m (\u00a3545m) repayment to the International Monetary Fund next week and avoid default.</p> <p>Greece is starved of cash but senior EU officials say there is no prospect of a deal releasing bailout money when the eurozone meets on Monday in Brussels.</p> <p>Tsipras said on Friday: \u201cI am confident that we will soon have a happy ending and that despite the difficulties ... we will carry out the agreement, which will be concluded soon in Europe.\u201d He added that his government was \u201cdoing whatever it should in order to reach ... an honest and mutually beneficial agreement with our partners\u201d.</p> <p>Greece has to pay the \u20ac750m to the IMF next Tuesday and is desperate to free up the \u20ac7.2bn in bailout funds still sitting blocked from its creditors. But while the brinkmanship between Athens and the eurozone has given way to more substantive negotiations recently, both sides are nowhere near a pact that would trade rescue funds for fiscal and economic reforms, a senior EU official said.</p> <p>The Eurogroup of finance ministers from the single currency zone meets in Brussels on Monday to wrestle with the Greek crisis. Stalemate has prevailed since the anti-austerity Tsipras government won power in January promising to defy the eurozone and reverse the terms of five years of austerity, prescribed mainly by Germany. But with time running out on a 30 June deadline for the bailout programme, neither side appears to be blinking.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still quite some way away ... from a final agreement,\u201d said the official. \u201cThere will be no final conclusion on Monday ... I don\u2019t expect a lengthy or contentious debate.\u201d</p> <p>In several days of negotiations last week, the Greeks were said to have made concessions over reform of their complex and confused VAT system, but to have dug in their heels against European demands on wages policy, labour market changes and pension cuts. This week Athens announced it was rehiring civil servants fired as part of public spending cuts enacted by the previous centre-right government under the terms of the bailout.</p> <p> While the Greek authorities are clearly running out of money, the contrasting narratives on both sides of the dispute and the non-stop propaganda make it difficult to determine when the country will run out of money. A failure to pay the IMF on Tuesday would be the start of a default. But Brussels appeared confident and sanguine that Athens would and could make the payment.</p> <p>The eurozone and the IMF have committed to a \u20ac240bn bailout of Greece since 2010 in an attempt to save the single currency from unravelling, but the tail-end of the rescue programme has in effect been frozen since last summer. In February the new Tsipras government agreed to extend the bailout until the end of next month but the eurozone refuses to disburse the remaining funds until Tsipras delivers on a persuasive programme of economic reforms.</p> <p>Non-stop negotiations over the past three months have brought only incremental progress and no release of money, while trust between the Greeks and their creditors has evaporated. Even if the current bailout was satisfactorily completed, the consensus is that Greece will still need a new arrangement with its creditors from July. The national debt has risen, and keeps rising under the bailout regime, to unsustainable levels.</p> <p>The assumption in Brussels is that Tsipras is aiming to get to the end of June without any substantive concessions and then try to merge the status quo into a new agreement, which would be less rigorous, more generous and might include elements of a debt writedown.</p> <p>The eurozone states bluntly, however, that this is not possible. Completion of the current programme review, said the official, was essential for starting negotiations on a gentler new arrangement. He emphasised that there had been no discussion within the Eurogroup about a new Greek programme and said that both sides would need to agree to conclude the current bailout by the end of the month. Otherwise things get \u201cvery, very tight\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the constant scares that Greece will default on its debt repayments and possibly crash out of the euro, there was little sign of nervousness in Brussels. \u201cThey are not flush, awash with cash, but I am confident they will make their upcoming payments,\u201d said the official. \u201cThere has been a significant rapprochement on issues, but no agreement on anything.\u201d</p> <p>Economists at Morgan Stanley warned there was still a significant risk of Greece leaving the eurozone. \u201cThe Eurogroup of finance ministers and the Greek government are unlikely to find an agreement just yet. We think that the funding situation remains critical in Greece, and that the probability of mis-steps potentially leading to capital controls or even euro-exit is high,\u201d they said in a research note.</p>",

Around 42% of investors rejected the company\u2019s remuneration policy, while 34% voted against its remuneration report and a further 2% abstained. Last year, only 3.5% of votes were cast against. Man Group noted the \u201csignificant\u201d number of votes cast against its pay policies,but insisted it had consulted investors ahead of the meeting and that the majority were supportive..

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Aldi has cut prices by an average 4% in the last six months, and 6% on its top-selling 100 products, as it battles to retain its discount credentials amid a bitter supermarket price war. Matthew Barnes, who stepped up to become chief executive of the grocers\u2019 UK and Irish business in April, told The Grocer trade journal that he was determined to maintain at least a 15% difference in price to mainstream supermarkets. \u201cThey are taking us very seriously, because they are very concerned. And the price gap hasn\u2019t narrowed, despite what they say. They try and fight us on price but they won\u2019t win,\u201d he said. Barnes suggested that shoppers\u2019 loss of trust in mainstream grocers\u2019 prices had been one of the foundations of its success in the UK. \u201cCustomers can trust us on pricing, we don\u2019t wildly fluctuate and we don\u2019t confuse them. It\u2019s why millions of customers come through our doors, including half-a-million new customers this year, because they are fed up with the smoke and mirrors, and their lack of trust, in other retailers.\u201d Aldi is currently the fastest-growing grocer in the UK. Its sales rose 15% in the three months to 25 April when sales of the big four supermarkets - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons - fell back. The chain\u2019s pace of growth has more than halved since a year ago, and is expected to fallto single digits by the end of this year as its most established stores reach their peak potential and price deflation continues. However, Aldi and its fellow German discounter Lidl, are still expected to continue winning market share at a rapid rate. Aldi overtook Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s sixth-largest grocer in March and Barnes made clear he expects to overtake the Co-op, to take fifth place, before long. \u201cIt\u2019s well within our sights,\u201d he told The Grocer. Aldi plans to open more than 70 stores this year and a similar number next year, as the major grocers close stores and abandon plans for new outlets. It is also testing out small city centre stores, which couldenable it to expand in London, where it currently has few outlets. A first such store in Kilburn, north-west London, is attracting 30,000 shoppers a week, with Barnes saying it was profitable and exceeding all expectations. \u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle just to cope. I know it\u2019s a lovely problem but it\u2019s still a challenge to offer customers the in-store experience we want,\u201d Barnes said. He admitted that some customers were beginning to grumble about stores being too busy but said Aldi was \u201cstill the leanest, meanest, and most efficient out there\u201d. In a warning to mainstream supermarkets he said: \u201cThe market is changing and we will continue changing it. It\u2019s similar to what we have seen in other countries, where the discounters weren\u2019t taken seriously for years. That structural repositioning is beginning to happen here, although it\u2019s by no means happened yet.\u201d",

It\u2019s why millions of customers come through our doors, including half-a-million new customers this year, because they are fed up with the smoke and mirrors, and their lack of trust, in other retailers.\u201d</p> <p>Aldi is currently the fastest-growing grocer in the UK. Its sales rose 15% in the three months to 25 April <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/06/grocery-price-falls-hurting-all-uk-supermarkets-kantar\">when sales of the big four supermarkets - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons - fell back</a>.</p> <p>The chain\u2019s pace of growth has more than halved since a year ago, and is expected to fallto single digits by the end of this year as its most established stores reach their peak potential and price deflation continues.</p> <p>However, Aldi and its fellow German discounter Lidl, are still expected to continue winning market share at a rapid rate. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/08/aldi-overtakes-waitrose-to-become-uks-sixth-largest-supermarket-chain\">Aldi overtook Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s sixth-largest grocer in March</a> and Barnes made clear he expects to overtake the Co-op, to take fifth place, before long. \u201cIt\u2019s well within our sights,\u201d he told The Grocer.</p> <p>Aldi plans to open more than 70 stores this year and a similar number next year, as the major grocers close stores and abandon plans for new outlets. It is also testing out small city centre stores, which couldenable it to expand in London, where it currently has few outlets.</p> <p>A first such store in Kilburn, north-west London, is attracting 30,000 shoppers a week, with Barnes saying it was profitable and exceeding all expectations. \u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle just to cope. I know it\u2019s a lovely problem but it\u2019s still a challenge to offer customers the in-store experience we want,\u201d Barnes said.</p> <p>He admitted that some customers were beginning to grumble about stores being too busy but said Aldi was \u201cstill the leanest, meanest, and most efficient out there\u201d.</p> <p>In a warning to mainstream supermarkets he said: \u201cThe market is changing and we will continue changing it. It\u2019s similar to what we have seen in other countries, where the discounters weren\u2019t taken seriously for years. That structural repositioning is beginning to happen here, although it\u2019s by no means happened yet.\u201d</p>",

The gap was filled by low-wage jobs: only 21% of jobs lost during the recession were those making less than $13.83 an hour, but they make up the majority of new jobs created during the recovery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/08/us-adds-jobs-april-unemployment-low\">US adds 223,000 jobs in April as unemployment falls to seven-year low</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, what will matter more than the number of new jobs created, the unemployment rate or even the long-term unemployment rate (another figure that niggles at many economists) is how much money those employed Americans will have at their disposal to spend.

Perhaps it\u2019s because, as <a href=\"http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2014/11/06/whats_causing_the_wage_stagnation_101376.html\">some pundits have hypothesized</a>, workers learned during the worst years of the downturn not to rock the boat by asking for raises or quitting to seek a new job that might pay a higher salary.</p> <p>The result? <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/182918/fewer-americans-identify-middle-class-recent-years.aspx\">Barely half of Americans</a> now see themselves as being part of the middle class, down from 63% in 2000, and well below the 61% average in the years leading up to 2008. That\u2019s an astonishing fact for a country whose central philosophy revolves around providing its citizens with opportunities to rise in the world. The problem is that the more unequal a society is, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/09/news/economy/america-economic-mobility/\">the more unequal it is likely to remain</a> \u2013 and we\u2019re actually a lot less mobile than we think we are, even if our perception is catching up to our reality.</p> <p>The ugly truth is that of those born into the poorest 20% of the population, only 10% will ever make it into the top quintile; nearly three-quarters won\u2019t even break out of that bottom tier and into the middle income. Since ultra-low wages not only harm individuals \u2013 limiting their job prospects and earnings power, their ability to both save and spend \u2013 but also their community and the broader economy, it\u2019s in all our interests to ensure that the salaries those in that bottom quintile collect aren\u2019t impossible to live on. Consider the plight of blue-collar workers in places such as Silicon Valley, some of whom are on the verge of being <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2013/10/16/2779601/wage-immigrants-silicon-valley/\">driven out even from the area\u2019s last remaining trailer parks</a> \u2013 the area\u2019s last affordable \u201chousing\u201d.</p> <p>To many mainstream politicians, the kind of arguments and solutions that Sanders advocates will sound old-fashioned. Unions? The slide in membership continued in 2014, and only 11.1% of American workers belong to one, in spite of data suggesting that union workers generally pocket higher wages. Democrats couldn\u2019t win support for a single-payer health plan and many support new trade arrangements that American critics feel <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tpp-press-conference-20150429-story.html\">will cost more jobs</a>.</p> <p>But when it comes to Sanders\u2019 diagnosis of the core problem, he has hit the nail squarely on the head, and any presidential candidate who can\u2019t address the growing problem of income inequality honestly is likely to face tough questions. Because the 1% may have all the income, and be able to buy lots of advertising for their preferred candidates, but they don\u2019t own the votes. Those still belong to the people wondering why their incomes have flatlined.</p>",

The problem is that the more unequal a society is, the more unequal it is likely to remain \u2013 and we\u2019re actually a lot less mobile than we think we are, even if our perception is catching up to our reality. The ugly truth is that of those born into the poorest 20% of the population, only 10% will ever make it into the top quintile; nearly three-quarters won\u2019t even break out of that bottom tier and into the middle income. Since ultra-low wages not only harm individuals \u2013 limiting their job prospects and earnings power, their ability to both save and spend \u2013 but also their community and the broader economy, it\u2019s in all our interests to ensure that the salaries those in that bottom quintile collect aren\u2019t impossible to live on. Consider the plight of blue-collar workers in places such as Silicon Valley, some of whom are on the verge of being driven out even from the area\u2019s last remaining trailer parks \u2013 the area\u2019s last affordable \u201chousing\u201d. To many mainstream politicians, the kind of arguments and solutions that Sanders advocates will sound old-fashioned. Unions? The slide in membership continued in 2014, and only 11.1% of American workers belong to one, in spite of data suggesting that union workers generally pocket higher wages. Democrats couldn\u2019t win support for a single-payer health plan and many support new trade arrangements that American critics feel will cost more jobs. But when it comes to Sanders\u2019 diagnosis of the core problem, he has hit the nail squarely on the head, and any presidential candidate who can\u2019t address the growing problem of income inequality honestly is likely to face tough questions. Because the 1% may have all the income, and be able to buy lots of advertising for their preferred candidates, but they don\u2019t own the votes. Those still belong to the people wondering why their incomes have flatlined.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "US unemployment has fallen to its lowest since 2008 after the economy added 223,000 jobs in April taking the unemployment rate down to 5.4% \u2013 close to the rate the Federal Reserve considers to be effective full employment. The jobless rate fell from 5.5% to 5.4% the lowest since May 2008 \u2013 before the financial crisis struck \u2013 in a signal that companies are confident about the strength of the US economy. The Labor Department said 223,000 people joined the workforce in April, slightly lower than expectations of 225,000 but much higher than the 85,000 job gain in March \u2013 which was the smallest increase since June 2012. The new figures take the number of US jobs added over the last 12 months to 3m. However, average hourly wages only grew by only 3% in April, taking year-on-year gains to 2.2%. The drop in the unemployment rate takes it close to the 5.0-5.2% range that Federal Reserve officials consider to be consistent with full employment, and raises the prospect that the Fed may increase interest rates later this year. The US central bank has kept interest rates near zero since December 2008. Fed officials, who in March dropped a promise to be \u201cpatient\u201d about raising rates, meet next to consider raising rates on June 16-17 but most experts expect rates to be held until later in the the year. \u201cThe additional hiring helped push the unemployment rate down to a seven-year low of 5.4%, edging closer to the 5.0-5.2% range which is widely seen as indicative of full employment,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. \u201cWeak wage growth remained the fly in the ointment of the labour market report, albeit with signs that pay pressures are gradually picking up, with average hourly earnings up 2.2% on a year ago. Low inflation is also likely to keep wage reviews down in coming months, suggesting there is little scope for any imminent marked upturn in pay growth. Low pay pressures should in turn help keep inflation down, meaning the Fed should be able to follow a steady and predictable course of small gradual hikes in interest rates.\u201d Wall Street welcomed the report, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1.5% to 18,191 points by 11:30am. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were also both up more than 1%. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, said the jobs figures were good but wage increases were disappointing which makes the chances of June interest rate hike very unlikely. \u201cIn the end, not the strong labour market release that could have put a June rate hike back on the table. And even with a really good payrolls figure for May, the June rate hike option now looks dead and buried.\u201d Economists at Capital Economics, said the report was \u201cbetter, but not great\u201d and \u201cany lingering possibility of a June rate hike from the Fed is now off the table\u201d. \u201cWe may see a further acceleration in employment growth going into the summer, but this isn\u2019t the sort of unequivocal rebound that would give the Fed the confidence to begin tightening monetary policy before independence day,\u201d Capital Economics\u2019s chief US economist Paul Ashworth said. Dennis Lockhart, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president, said: \u201cThe report comes at a time in which I, for one, at least am very tuned in to what signals the economy is throwing off. I view it as a very important one to tell us about the growth momentum in the economy.\u201d He was speaking to reporters on 6 May before the report was published. Job growth was most strong in the construction industry with 45,000 new jobs compared to a 9,000 fall the previous month. Over the past 12 months construction has added 280,000 job, this a particularly good sign for economic growth as it suggests companies are confidently moving forward with expansion plans. Professional services and the healthcare sectors also performed well, while there was a loss of 15,000 manufacturing and oil industry-related jobs. Since the beginning of the year employment in mining and oil has declined by 49,000. Nike will later on Friday pledge to hire 10,000 US workers over the next decade if President Obama\u2019s Pacific trade agreement passes Congress. Nike currently has 26,000 employees in the United States, but 330,000 in Vietnam, where the minimum wage is 56 cents an hour. Obama is due to speak at Nike\u2019s headquarters in Portland later on Friday, where he will be given a one-of-a-kind pair of red, white and blue \u201cAir Force One\u201d sneakers [trainers] to commemorate the visit.",

Over the past 12 months construction has added 280,000 job, this a particularly good sign for economic growth as it suggests companies are confidently moving forward with expansion plans. Professional services and the healthcare sectors also performed well, while there was a loss of 15,000 manufacturing and oil industry-related jobs. Since the beginning of the year employment in mining and oil has declined by 49,000.</p> <p>Nike <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/08/obama-democratic-support-nike-hq\">will later on Friday</a> pledge to hire 10,000 US workers over the next decade if President Obama\u2019s Pacific trade agreement passes Congress. Nike currently has 26,000 employees in the United States, but 330,000 in Vietnam, where the minimum wage is 56 cents an hour.</p> <p>Obama is due to speak at Nike\u2019s headquarters in Portland later on Friday, where he will be given a one-of-a-kind pair of red, white and blue \u201cAir Force One\u201d sneakers [trainers] to commemorate the visit.</p>",

BG agreed to the takeover, worth 52% more than its share price at the time, after the price of oil roughly halved since the summer. But some BG shareholders have questioned the wisdom of the deal now that the oil price has started to recover. Lund said: \u201cWe believe that the offer from Shell represents an attractive offer to our shareholders. Therefore there has been a unanimous recommendation from our board. We assessed [the offer] on a range of different oil and gas prices. There is no change to our view of the offer.\u201d",

The FTSE 250 index - a broader measure of the UK economy - reached an all-time high as bookmaker Ladbrokes leapt 9%, as did housebuilders Countrywide and Berkeley and Savills and Foxtons, the estate agency chains. Savills predicted a release of pent-up demand in the top end of the housing market, given that Labour\u2019s mansion tax would not be introduced. Sterling registered its biggest jump against the US dollar since 2009, while shares in banks, energy companies and housebuilders all fuelled a rise in the FTSE 100 as the prospect of a Labour government evaporated. Yields on UK government bonds (gilts), which reflects the price that the government pays to borrow, fell sharply in anticipation that the Bank of England will not be in a hurry to raise interest rates from their historic lows. The FTSE 100 initially jumped 150 points, more than 2%, at the open, registering an early high of 7,036, as companies targeted by Labour policies all registered gains.

      "bodyText": "In its way, the response of the stock market to the Conservative victory in the general election said it all about the British economy. Shares in banks, upmarket estate agents, outsourcing companies and firms employing plenty of zero-hour contract workers all surged. The City, property speculation and a service sector running on cheap labour: for all the talk of rebalancing, repeated by David Cameron on the steps of Downing Street, that\u2019s where the action is. There was, of course, another reason why the Square Mile was running short of Dom Perignon: most of those working in dealing rooms stood to lose personally from a Labour government. They live in big houses, they would have been liable to income tax at 50% and they would have been hit by a bankers\u2019 bonus tax. Never has the phrase \u201crelief rally\u201d been more appropriate. There will be plenty of discussion about why the opinion polls got it wrong. The answer seems to be that not enough voters trusted Ed Miliband to run the economy, something the polls have been picking up for the past five years. Once lost, a reputation for economic competence is hard to regain. Labour is still paying a heavy price for being in charge during Britain\u2019s worst recession since the 1930s, and struggled to challenge the Conservative narrative: Labour failed to mend the roof while the sun was shining and left the country broke when the crisis arrived. Veteran MP Gerald Kaufman once described the 1983 Labour party manifesto as the longest suicide note in history: Liam Byrne\u2019s 2010 note when he left the Treasury, saying that there was \u201cno money left\u201d, was the shortest. The sobering news for whoever replaces Ed Miliband is that over the past 40 years, governments have only tended to be turfed out after a really severe economic shock. The Winter of Discontent did for Labour in 1979. The Conservatives never recovered from Black Wednesday in 1992, and Gordon Brown lost as a result of the global financial crisis. Long periods of one-party rule are the rule not the exception in the UK, so unless something terrible befalls the economy in the next five years, the Conservatives can be reasonably confident of doing well again in 2020. All that said, the euphoria in the City is unlikely to last long. That\u2019s not to minimise the election result, but rather a reflection on the nature of financial markets: they quickly move on to thinking about what might be the next big thing. They were already back to fretting about a possible Greek departure from the euro by the time Cameron returned from seeing the Queen at Buckingham Palace. There are three homegrown factors that could derail the economy in the months and years ahead. The first is that growth remains too dependent on financial and business services in London and the south-east, and too dependent on low-paid services everywhere else. The second factor is politics. Conservative strategists will already be thinking about how to win again in 2020, and the best way of doing that is to get the economic and political cycles aligned. That means the government will want to front-load austerity in the hope that healthier public finances will permit tax cuts from the middle of the parliament onwards. This strategy resulted in a sharp slowdown in growth in the first two years of the 2010-15 parliament, but given the election result, the Conservatives will be minded to adopt the same approach a second time. The third factor is the possibility that Britain might vote to leave the European Union in the referendum that will now take place by 2017. Sterling came under pressure when there appeared to be a possibility that Scotland would vote for independence in last year\u2019s referendum and would certainly do so again if markets thought there was a realistic chance of Britain leaving the EU. Of the obvious threats, Brexit from Europe is the biggest. There are, though, Black Swan events that are impossible to predict, of which the global financial crisis was one. David Cameron has to beware the unknown unknowns as well as the known unknowns. He will find it harder next time to blame his legacy if the economy turns sour.",

It plans to combine the business with its existing UK network Three, to create Britain\u2019s largest mobile operator with 33 million customers and the country\u2019s most extensive 4G internet service. On Friday Hutchison announced a deal to sell one third of the combined business to a multinational group of investors led by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), which will invest a \u00a31.1bn share alongside Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte, Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, Limpart Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual. Hutchison Whampoa\u2019s group managing director Canning Fok said: \u201cLike us, the willingness of these investors to commit substantial capital to this investment reflects continued confidence in the UK economy and its commitment to maintain and foster a dynamic and world leading telecommunications sector, as well as a vote of confidence in Europe\u2019s plans for a single market in digital communications, leading to increased investment in the telecoms sector.\u201d The collective has agreed to pay \u00a32.77bn in cash on completion of the deal, with a further maximum of \u00a3330m dependent on cash flows at the combined O2 and Three businesses by the time the deal completes. Hutchison will fund the rest of the purchase using a bank facility of \u00a36bn. Completion is expected in 2016 but the merger must first secure approval from the EU competition authorities. \u201cThis is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a meaningful stake in what will become a leading mobile operator in the UK, giving us immediate scale in an important sector,\u201d said Mark Jenkins, of CPPIB. Hutchison signalled early on that it was likely to fund the acquisition of Three\u2019s larger UK rival O2 by selling a stake to outside investors. CPPIB\u2019s potential involvement was rumoured in February, when it was reported to be in discussions with Hutchison along with another Canadian entity, the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan.",

    "webTitle": "Pound rises 1% against dollar after poll tips Tories to win most seats", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound has hit its highest level since late February after the Conservatives emerged as the winner from the general election. Sterling surged by 1.75% to $1.55, its highest level since late February, after an exit poll predicted that the Tories would be the largest party. But by 6am a revised exit poll said David Cameron was on course to win 325 seats and Labour on 232, giving the Tory leader an overall majority. This much better than expected election performance by the Tories sent FTSE futures higher with traders hoping that an end to coalition government would confirm the extension of the Conservatives\u2019 austerity programme and reduction of the national debt. Traders predicted the FTSE 100 would be 70 points higher when the markets open at 8am. The index of Britain\u2019s 100 biggest companies closed down 47 points at 6,887 on Thursday, before the exit poll was published. The pound rose strongly after the exit poll at 10pm, and continued to rally as results came in from across the country. By 5.30am it had gained almost three cents against the US dollar. Sterling also gained strongly against the euro to pass the \u20ac1.38 mark by 5am. Alan Clarke, a fixed income strategist at Scotiabank, said: \u201cAgainst the odds, on the basis of the exit poll seat projections, a second Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition looks a distinct possibility. \u201cThis is most likely to come as a pleasant surprise to financial markets. Our judgment is that the markets were bracing for a messier outcome where the Labour party would be reluctantly propped up by the SNP.\u201d However, Clarke said the market\u2019s biggest concern will be \u201cthe prospect of an EU referendum as promised by David Cameron if he was still prime minister\u201d. Chris Beauchamp, a senior market analyst at IG, said the Tory surge had electrified markets. He said: \u201cThe exit poll certainly comes as a surprise, putting the Conservatives well ahead on 316. Crucially, Cameron is expected to still be short of a majority, but it looks like any putative anti-Tory coalition will have a harder job on its hands blocking any Queen\u2019s speech authored largely by the Conservatives. \u201cA strong Conservative element to the next government sends the message that the economic policies of the past five years will continue, removing concerns about an early end to austerity.\u201d However, he warned that the pound could fall back as it dawns on traders that the Conservative party has promised to hold a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. He said: \u201cWe could see the pound drop back as this realisation sinks in.\u201d Jeremy Cook, the chief economist at World First, said: \u201cMarkets were sat waiting for this poll, looking for either of the main two parties to get close to 300 seats and make the building of a coalition that much easier: 316 is a lot better than anyone was expecting and sterling is benefiting widely from this. \u201cObviously we can talk about the risks of a referendum on EU membership but, should this poll hold, the risk of a drawn-out, squabbling and disorganised coalition-building period seems to have been put to bed and sterling is back in favour.\u201d Before the poll was released, the pound had ended the day roughly flat at $1.52. Daragh Maher, a currency strategist at HSBC, said: \u201cSterling is rallying in a historically appropriate way to signal that Cameron is most likely to be the next prime minister. Going into the exit poll, the market was anticipating a messy signal and would be anticipating some sterling weakness. \u201cAn outcome in line with the exit poll would in the short term be business-friendly, given that it would not lead to weeks and weeks of wrangling, but the medium-term story really begins to put the spotlight onto an EU referendum.\u201d While the City\u2019s reflex approach may be to favour the Conservatives, with the party\u2019s plans for more rapid deficit reduction, over Labour, which has promised to take on vested interests, including in the financial and energy sectors, analysts said investors were very concerned about the risk of Britain leaving the EU under a Tory-led coalition. Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should leave the EU by 2017. Brian Hilliard, the chief UK economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said: \u201cIf I\u2019m layering the risks, and seeing what is the thing that could do most damage to markets after the initial stage, then it\u2019s Brexit, rather than the fiscal plans of the Labour party.\u201d He added that with Europe\u2019s bond markets in a tailspin on Thursday, it was hard to separate pre-election nerves from other factors weighing on markets. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can isolate the effects of the election.\u201d German bond yields \u2013 the interest rate that Berlin pays on its borrowing \u2013 shot up before collapsing back later in the day. Jasper Lawler, from CMC Markets UK, said: \u201cEuropean stock markets were left a little out of breath on Thursday as government bond markets pulled a full 180-degree turn from savage losses to a sizeable move higher.\u201d According to BATS Global Markets, it was one of the busiest days for European stock markets in the past two years. About \u20ac72bn (\u00a353bn) of shares changed hands \u2013 double the average for a typical day in May.",
