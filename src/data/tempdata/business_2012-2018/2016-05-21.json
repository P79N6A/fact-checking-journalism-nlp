      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s largest oil companies have in recent weeks announced a series of \u201cgreen\u201d investments \u2013 in wind farms, electric battery storage systems and carbon capture and storage (CCS). These unexpected moves come hot on the heels of revelations by Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest crude exporter, that it plans to sell off parts of its national oil company and diversify its economy away from petroleum. They also come in the aftermath of a United Nations climate change agreement and before annual general meetings for Shell and Exxon Mobil this week, meetings at which shareholders will demand that more be done to tackle climate change. So has the fossil fuel industry finally woken up to the dangers posed to their futures by a move to a low-carbon world, or is this all \u201cgreenwash\u201d \u2013 relatively insignificant investments designed to shake off critics? Or does it just make good business sense for Big Oil to do this at a time when oil prices are low, renewable projects look like steady long-term investments, and green businesses can be snapped up on the cheap? Some of the moves certainly have serious amounts of cash behind them. Total of France, for instance, announced two weeks ago that it planned to spend nearly \u20ac1bn on buying 100-year-old battery manufacturer Saft. Chairman and chief executive Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 said the deal would \u201callow us to complement our portfolio with electricity storage solutions, a key component of the future growth of renewable energy\u201d. Pouyann\u00e9 had said in April that electricity would be \u201cthe energy of the 21st century\u201d and that he wanted his company to take advantage of the entire electricity value chain, including batteries, solar power and biogas generation. Total announced last year that it was spending \u20ac200m on transforming an unprofitable oil refinery into a biofuel plant, and separately that it would start to invest $500m a year in renewables. Total made its first real drive into renewable energy five years ago, with its $1.4bn acquisition of SunPower, one of the largest solar panel makers in the US. Total has also since set up a division, called New Energies, for these low-carbon technologies. Shell has done the same. No public announcement has yet been made but, behind the scenes, the Anglo-Dutch group has also established a New Energies arm, under the control of executive board member Maarten Wetselaar. Ben van Beurden, the Shell group chief executive, is expected to talk about the new division at the company\u2019s annual capital markets day on 7 June, but it is known to encompass existing hydrogen, biofuels and electricity activities. Shell\u2019s New Energies arm will have a $200m annual budget for acquisitions. Last month, the group made a bid, with partners, to build two windfarms off the coast of the Netherlands that could generate enough electricity to power 825,000 households. Its Big Oil rival, Statoil of Norway, has also been active in the sector: it last month outlined plans to spend \u20ac1.2bn, in partnership with E.ON, on the German Arkona windfarm in the Baltic sea. \u201cThis investment is in line with our strategy to gradually complement our oil and gas portfolio with profitable renewable energy and other low-carbon solutions,\u201d said Eldar S\u00e6tre, Statoil\u2019s president and chief executive. Statoil has also just been granted a seabed lease that will allow it to build the world\u2019s largest floating windfarm, Hywind, off the coast of Scotland. A new battery storage solution for offshore wind energy will be piloted from the same project, and Statoil has also followed the trend and established a New Energy division for wind power and CCS. The Norwegian state operator has also just established a new fund, Statoil Energy Ventures, which will invest up to $200m over four to seven years. Irene Rummelhoff, executive vice-president for New Energy Solutions at Statoil, said she was convinced global warming was a very serious problem and her company wanted to help find a solution. \u201cWe strongly believe oil and gas will still be needed in future but we also know we have to do things differently and are working to reduce the carbon footprint of these operations,\u201d she said. \u201cEqually we are building a renewable energy business, not because we have to, but because we want to. There is tremendous growth in that sector and we want to be part of that. \u201cIt makes sense to utilise our project-management skills from oil and gas to offshore wind which is why we are operating Sheringham Shoals and Dudgeon Sands off the UK. We are also looking at more carbon capture schemes and at solar [worldwide].\u201d Even Exxon Mobil, often dismissed by climate change activists as the most conservative oil company of them all, has recently unveiled plans to investigate CCS more fully in a new partnership with a fuel cell company. But some of the sums being invested are quite small: the Shell New Energies, for example, has a capital expenditure budget of just under 0.5% of its total. And oil companies do have form for shouting loudly about moving into renewables only to beat a hasty retreat. BP in particular was pilloried for promising to go \u201cbeyond petroleum\u201d \u2013 then running down its alternative energy division. Shell used to have a very big solar business, but this was scaled down several years ago. Environmentalists are increasing the pressure on oil companies by accusing them of trying to slow the march to low-carbon energy, if not of being the climate-change deniers some were of old. There are even claims that Big Oil has been deliberately infiltrating renewable energy lobby groups so that it can push its agenda of keeping gas, in particular, as a \u201ctransition fuel\u201d of the future \u2013 something the companies deny. But academics such as Paul Stevens, an energy expert at thinktank Chatham House, have warned that large oil companies must transform their business or face a \u201cshort, brutal\u201d end within 10 years. Jeremy Leggett, a former petroleum geologist who went on to found photovoltaics group SolarCentury, thinks the oil companies are taking precautions as the world moves towards low-carbon energy. \u201cThe oil and gas majors are in a fascinating place,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to use clean-energy investments to hedge their bets that markets for oil and gas will exist decades from now. \u201cThese investments are of varying degrees of seriousness. I would put Total at the top of the league table at the moment. But, unlike many of the big utilities, none of the majors has yet grasped the nettle and told stakeholders that the game is up. That oil and gas will be over by year X, and strategy is now being based on back-mapping from that year.\u201d The Brussels-based SolarPower Europe lobby group also believes that of all the oil majors, Total of France is on a steady path to become the \u201cgreen giant\u201d of the future. James Watson, chief executive of SolarPower Europe, says: \u201cWe take Total\u2019s moves seriously. From our perspective, it has been a long-time player in solar, it was a founding member of SolarPower Europe back in 1985. It acquired SunPower back in 2011 and recently announced that it wants to be one of the top three solar players by early next decade. \u201cI suspect that it has also been pushing for the French government to drive solar \u2013 and we saw recently the announcement by the French government that they will triple the amount of deployed solar in France by 2022. This could make France the leading annual installer in Europe up to that point. \u201cShell has a stake in the Japanese solar company Solar Frontier, but has yet to do anything in Europe. We know its boss sees solar as the backbone of energy in the future, but at an undefined time. Having no date does not suggest a strong commitment.\u201d Oil analysts themselves say it makes sense for oil companies to invest in renewables at a time when the value of green firms is also depressed by the low oil price. One leading City figure saw lots of reason for this: \u201cAssets are relatively cheap; it\u2019s a good time to diversify; and you can keep some of the low-carbon critics at bay. Also, the oil companies have a herd mentality: once one of them does it, you can expect the rest to follow. You could say green is in fashion.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group is going back to the future, and its chosen destination is 1968, when Mrs Robinson was in the charts and the average house price in Britain was \u00a34,000. Fast forward to this week and the group will begin a major facelift of its vast business, tearing down the lime-green frontages of its food shops and replacing them with a new blue logo. The cloverleaf-like design will look familiar to loyal members of the Co-op, because it was first launched back in 1968 and abandoned a decade ago when the group decided a more corporate look was needed. The facelift is part of a \u00a31.3bn investment to breathe fresh life into the 172-year-old group. It will include refurbishing the food shops and funeral homes and paying for new systems in its insurance business, as well as improving products and services. The relaunch is about more than shop windows and a new logo on a pint of milk: at its annual meeting in Manchester on Saturday, the mutual revealed plans to hand tens of millions of pounds back to its 8.4 million members and their communities through a new rewards scheme. As chairman Allan Leighton puts it, the Co-op is seeking \u201ca better way of doing business\u201d. The rebrand comes after the group, which traces its roots back to the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers in 1844, recovers from its near-meltdown in 2013 and 2014, when a crisis at the Co-op\u2019s bank took the organisation to the verge of collapse. There was a \u00a31.5bn black hole in the banking business; the division\u2019s former chairman, Methodist minister Paul Flowers, was engulfed in a very public sex and drugs scandal; and the group\u2019s chief executive resigned after the size of his pay package \u2013 \u00a36.6m \u2013 was revealed by the Observer. A radical shake-up of the board followed, new bosses were brought in \u2013 with Leighton as chairman and Richard Pennycook as chief executive \u2013 parts of the business were sold off, and the group reduced its stake in the bank to 20%. Since then Pennycook and Leighton have been quietly been putting the business back together and feel it is now ready to step out of the shadows following its very public humiliation. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bit of a bounce-back,\u201d says Rod Bulmer, the head of the Co-op\u2019s consumer services business, including funeral care. The mention of Flowers\u2019s name is still uncomfortable: \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about Paul Flowers,\u201d says Bulmer. \u201cWe see that as part of the crisis point in the past, and we think we are through that by some distance.\u201d As well as unveiling the new look to members on Saturday, the Co-op Group revealed new member benefits, designed to retain the loyalty of its existing members and attract new ones. It wants another million members within the next five years, hoping that a return to the traditional values of the co-operative movement, where community comes before profits, will appeal to a new generation. Steve Murrells, chief executive of the food business, says: \u201cHindsight and reflection would say that, for a period of years, the society lost its way. When we moved to a more corporate logo it was probably the right thing back then, but it has become abundantly clear that we do need to go back to our roots.\u201d Under the new plans, members will receive a 5% reward every time they buy a Co-op own-brand product or service \u2013 whether that be a tin of beans or a funeral. The amount will be credited to members\u2019 accounts, and can then be cashed in as a discount against future goods and services. A further 1% will be credited to the members\u2019 account to be donated to a local cause of their choosing, such as a new park or local charity. The group says it has already identified 1,500 communities where the rewards could be invested. The benefits will be available from autumn this year, and by 2018 it is estimated that the scheme will see \u00a3100m a year being handed back to members of the society and the community. \u201cWe are putting money back into the hands of members and communities. We don\u2019t believe we are considered a profit centre,\u201d Murrells says. \u201cEverything will be put back into the community or given directly to members when we have effectively paid down the costs of running the business. The more customers who shop with us, the more good we can do.\u201d The group is hoping that, within five years, half of its sales across the various businesses will be generated by members \u2013 currently, in the food business, it\u2019s a quarter. The new membership rewards will be offered in addition to traditional dividend payments, which were suspended during the dark times in 2014 and will not be resumed until 2017 at the earliest. The financial crisis shone a light on some of the worst practices of big business and led to public outrage over boardroom excesses \u2013 an issue that is still being played out at annual meetings around the country as shareholders revolt against executive pay deals. Murrells says the national mood, particularly among younger people, presents an opportunity for the Co-op. \u201cBack as far as 2012, it was clear to us that the younger generation was very sceptical of big business and very aligned to the model of co-operatives,\u201d he says. \u201cThe signals were there and we knew as a business we had the chance to reach out to younger people. \u201cSo the [new] logo will resonate with members that have stuck by the Co-op and with new, younger members. We have been working towards this day.\u201d As if to lead by example, chief executive Pennycook has asked for a pay cut after receiving a total of \u00a33.59m last year including an annual bonus of \u00a31.12m. His basic salary will be cut from \u00a31.25m to \u00a3750,000 from July, although reductions in potential bonuses do not begin until 2017. The changes announced on Saturday reflect the group\u2019s determination to lay the shambles of 2013 and 2014 to rest and carve a successful future. They are pinning their hopes on a \u201cback to being the Co-op\u201d approach that goes back to 1968 and before. \u201cThe opportunity is huge if we can get that engagement right,\u201d says Bulmer.",

It will include refurbishing the food shops and funeral homes and paying for new systems in its insurance business, as well as improving products and services.</p> <p>The relaunch is about more than shop windows and a new logo on a pint of milk: at its annual meeting in Manchester on Saturday, the mutual revealed plans to hand tens of millions of pounds back to its 8.4 million members and their communities through a new rewards scheme. As chairman Allan Leighton puts it, the Co-op is seeking \u201ca better way of doing business\u201d.</p> <p>The rebrand comes after the group, which traces its roots back to the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers in 1844, recovers from its near-meltdown in 2013 and 2014, when a crisis at the Co-op\u2019s bank took the organisation to the verge of collapse.</p> <p>There was a \u00a31.5bn black hole in the banking business; the division\u2019s former chairman, Methodist minister Paul Flowers, was engulfed in a very public sex and drugs scandal; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/11/co-operative-group-chief-executive-euan-sutherland-resign\" title=\"\">the group\u2019s chief executive resigned after the size of his pay package \u2013 \u00a36.6m \u2013 was revealed by the <em>Observer</em></a>.</p> <p>A radical shake-up of the board followed, new bosses were brought in \u2013 with Leighton as chairman and Richard Pennycook as chief executive \u2013 parts of the business were sold off, and the group reduced its stake in the bank to 20%.</p> <p>Since then Pennycook and Leighton have been quietly been putting the business back together and feel it is now ready to step out of the shadows following its very public humiliation. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bit of a bounce-back,\u201d says Rod Bulmer, the head of the Co-op\u2019s consumer services business, including funeral care.</p> <p>The mention of Flowers\u2019s name is still uncomfortable: \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about Paul Flowers,\u201d says Bulmer. \u201cWe see that as part of the crisis point in the past, and we think we are through that by some&#xa0;distance.\u201d</p> <p>As well as unveiling the new look to members on Saturday, the Co-op Group revealed new member benefits, designed to retain the loyalty of its existing members and attract new ones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"27bdd3b01ade8c439b98fab658d63407ce687b6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27bdd3b01ade8c439b98fab658d63407ce687b6b/0_452_7087_4253/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The new logo as it will appear on stores from this week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new logo as it will appear on stores from this week.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wants another million members within the next five years, hoping that a return to the traditional values of the co-operative movement, where community comes before profits, will appeal to a new generation.</p> <p>Steve Murrells, chief executive of the food business, says: \u201cHindsight and reflection would say that, for a period of years, the society lost its way. When we moved to a more corporate logo it was probably the right thing back then, but it has become abundantly clear that we do need to go back to our roots.\u201d</p> <p>Under the new plans, members will receive a 5% reward every time they buy a Co-op own-brand product or service \u2013 whether that be a tin of beans or a funeral. The amount will be credited to members\u2019 accounts, and can then be cashed in as a discount against future goods and services.</p> <p>A further 1% will be credited to the members\u2019 account to be donated to a local cause of their choosing, such as a new park or local charity. The group says it has already identified 1,500 communities where the rewards could be invested.</p> <p>The benefits will be available from autumn this year, and by 2018 it is estimated that the scheme will see \u00a3100m a year being handed back to members of the society and the community.</p> <p>\u201cWe are putting money back into the hands of members and communities. We don\u2019t believe we are considered a profit centre,\u201d Murrells says. \u201cEverything will be put back into the community or given directly to members when we have effectively paid down the costs of running the business. The more customers who shop with us, the more good we can do.\u201d</p> <p>The group is hoping that, within five years, half of its sales across the various businesses will be generated by members \u2013 currently, in the food business, it\u2019s a quarter.</p> <p>The new membership rewards will be offered in addition to traditional dividend payments, which were suspended during the dark times in 2014 and will not be resumed until 2017 at the earliest.</p> <p>The financial crisis shone a light on some of the worst practices of big business and led to public outrage over boardroom excesses \u2013 an issue that is still being played out at annual meetings around the country as shareholders revolt against executive pay deals.</p> <p>Murrells says the national mood, particularly among younger people, presents an opportunity for the Co-op. \u201cBack as far as 2012, it was clear to us that the younger generation was very sceptical of big business and very aligned to the model of co-operatives,\u201d he says. \u201cThe signals were there and we knew as a business we had the chance to reach out to younger people.</p> <p>\u201cSo the [new] logo will resonate with members that have stuck by the Co-op and with new, younger members.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a busy week for the US labor secretary, Tom Perez. On Tuesday night, the White House announced that the Obama administration had finalized a new rule that could potentially expand overtime benefits to 4.2 million more Americans. On Wednesday morning, Perez boarded Air Force Two and with Vice-President Joe Biden and flew to Columbus, Ohio, where they made the official public announcement inside Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Creams. The new rule has been described by some as second only to the Affordable Care Act in its ability to affect the wellbeing of working- and middle-class Americans. Perez, who has been at the head of the US Department of Labor for nearly three years, has made the overtime rule a priority even as he has toured the country speaking to workers and advocating for other worker-friendly policies such as higher minimum wages at the local, state and federal level. With two-thirds of a year left until the new president is sworn in, Perez still has an intimidating list of unfinished business \u2013 paid leave, auto-enrolling US workers into 401K or other pension programs and a higher minimum wage among others\u2013 that he\u2019d like to accomplish. As the election nears, he may have even more on his plate: Perez is said to be a potential vice-presidential pick. He is clearly unafraid of a challenge. Big business has come out swinging against his changes to paid leave. Perez is unfazed. \u201cWe are the only industrialized nation on the planet that does not have some form of paid leave. We are the only industrialized nation where paid leave is a partisan issue,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI got in trouble recently because I said: \u2018The United States and Papua New Guinea are the only nations on the planet that do not have some form of paid leave.\u2019 Someone approached me after and said: \u2018Hey, I am from Papua New Guinea and we have been taking an initiative. Stop dissing New Guinea.\u2019 So I want to note my own error and apologize for dissing New Guinea. We are alone as a nation.\u201d A good listener \u201cTom Perez has guts,\u201d said Michael Subin, executive director of the Montgomery County\u2019s criminal justice coordinating commission. \u201cWhen he sees injustice, he is not afraid to take on those committing the injustice.\u201d Subin and Perez worked together in the early 2000s when Perez served as a member and then a president of the Montgomery County council. Together they proposed the Perez-Subin bill that sought to limit predatory lending. According to Subin, Perez knows how to get things done. \u201cLot of legislators don\u2019t understand what they have to do and how the system works best. He was able to get things done because he was able to work with people,\u201d he said. \u201cHe understood what they were looking for, what their issues might have been regarding specific pieces of legislation. And he listened.\u201d Mary Kay Henry, president of the SEIU \u2013 one of the largest labor unions in the US \u2013 enjoys working with Perez because \u201che gets us\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain struggles that people have. He is often telling me stories of people he has just met \u2013 about how they are stitching together two or three jobs to make ends meet and that we have to stop it. What are we going to do together to get things right? He has really been a privilege to work with.\u201d One morning early in May, Perez made his way to Brooklyn\u2019s Sunset Park neighborhood to visit UnCommonGoods, an online and catalogue retailer. In a small conference room, six workers sat awaiting his arrival. Most of them had started at UnCommonGoods as seasonal workers and have then transitioned into permanent positions, quickly climbing the ladder within the company. UnCommonGoods is what Perez would describe as a \u201cconscious capitalism\u201d company focused on developing its workers by paying them well, listening to their feedback and incorporating that into how the company is managed. \u201cI came here for the job, but I stayed for the culture,\u201d said Joel Villa, an operations supervisor who started at the company in 2013. \u201c I can grow and learn here.\u201d As he toured the UnCommonGoods warehouse, Perez displayed an easy charm. Spotting one of the workers with a staff-designed handheld scanner, he said: \u201cCan I see your gun for a minute?\u201d As the employee handed it over, Perez looked it over and posed for photos. \u201cIt\u2019s so elegant,\u201d he said handing it back. \u201cShow me what you\u2019re doing here?\u201d Later that day, Perez would go on to visit the kitchen of The Modern \u2013 one of Danny Meyer\u2019s restaurants with a no-tipping policy. He is as comfortable in a kitchen as he is in a warehouse, in a hard hat on a construction site or bending pipes in a garage. Making house calls, as he refers to his visits with employees and employers, is a key part of his job as a labor secretary and enables him to \u201cunderstand the angst\u201d of those Americans who still feel left behind in the economic recovery. \u201cPeople in this country are resilient. I\u2019ve met so many folks who got kicked to the side of the road in the Great Recession and they\u2019ve rebounded. They inspire me,\u201d he said. \u201cI also meet people who are trying their hardest and are working a full-time job and they are getting their food at a food pantry. I\u2019ve met a woman in Detroit a few months ago \u2013 she joined the Fight for $15 movement, mother of three. The night before I met her, she slept in her car with her three kids. That\u2019s not right. We can do better as a nation.\u201d Just days after his visit to Brooklyn, the Department of Labor released its April jobs report noting that the US economy added just 160,000 jobs, about 40,000 fewer than expected. \u201cIt\u2019s another solid report,\u201d Perez told the Guardian that afternoon, pointing out that the number of long-term unemployed has been dropping amid optimism about the US job market. \u201cThe percentage of long-term unemployed is the lowest in seven years.\u201d With the unemployment rate reaching 5% \u2013 down from 10% in October 2009 \u2013 there are fewer workers on the market and employers are going to have to hire workers who \u201cmight have a 12-month hole on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve met these folks. They have incredible talent,\u201d said Perez. \u201cTheir only mistake \u2013 if you want to call it a mistake \u2013 is that they were at a wrong place at a wrong time during the Great Recession.\u201d On a cold, wet February morning, Perez met half a dozen New Jerseyans who were over 55 years old and had been out of work for an average of 1.8 years. The panel took place at Rutgers University, which had recently launched a \u201cNew Start Career Network\u201d focusing on older, long-term unemployed workers. \u201cFor them, it was hugely significant, the simple fact that the highest-ranking official in the country who deals with these issues took the time to talk to them about their experiences with long-term unemployment,\u201d Maria Heidkamp, director of the network, told the Guardian. \u201cIt was very meaningful to them.\u201d In the nearly four months since they met Perez, one of the attendees got a one-year contract. Three others were able to find short-term work on a two- to three-month contract. \u201cWe are hoping that in couple of those cases it turns into something longer term,\u201d said Heidkamp. What\u2019s next While visiting long-term unemployed in New Jersey, Perez joked that with his history of working for a handful of employers in the public sector for longer periods of time, he \u201cwould have had trouble on the job hunt\u201d in a modern market where staying with one employer is not always viewed favorably. Jokes aside, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is impressive. After becoming the first Latino elected to the Montgomery County council and later serving as its president, Perez ran for attorney general of Maryland in 2006. However, his campaign came to a stop after one of his rivals sued him alleging that he had not practiced law for 10 years and therefore did not meet the requirements to serve. That same year, Martin O\u2019Malley was elected as the state\u2019s governor and later appointed Perez to serve as the state\u2019s labor secretary. In October of 2009, Perez joined the US Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division as assistant general attorney. While there he had investigated the death of Trayvon Martin, who was killed by George Zimmerman in February 2012, abuse at police departments in cities such as Miami and Seattle and civil rights violations by anti-immigration sheriff Joe Arpaio. In the summer of 2013, he was tagged by Barack Obama to run the US Department of Labor. To many of his supporters it comes as no surprise that since then, Perez\u2019s name has been floated for a number of other posts. When Eric Holder stepped down as US attorney general, Mother Jones ran a piece headlined: \u201cWhy picking Tom Perez for attorney general would be a smart move for Obama\u201d. Earlier this year when the supreme court justice Antonin Scalia died, Perez\u2019s name came up in the pool of potential replacements. The past few months have also seen speculation that Perez might end up as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate. Perez \u2013 who has at times joined Clinton on the campaign trail \u2013 insists he is focused on his day job. \u201cEvery engagement that I have had with him, he knows the number of days left in the president\u2019s term,\u201d said Henry. \u201cThe thing I admire in him is that even though speculation is happening, he remains laser-focused on trying to implement the fair pay and safe workplaces executive orders that we worked for six years to come to light. He is completely indefatigable on making sure that anything on his plate gets his full attention before he ends the term.\u201d On Friday, while speaking to a room of journalists, Perez once again dodged a question about his possible vice-presidency. The comments came after he said mass deportation proposals floated by some Republicans \u201cwon\u2019t happen\u201d and added that he was confident the US government was going to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next year. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep demonizing the largest growing population in America and think that that\u2019s a good strategy for growth,\u201d he said, pointing to the naturalization movement in immigrant communities. \u201cImmigration reformation is long overdue.\u201d \u201cSpoken like a vice-presidential nominee,\u201d quipped Bernie Kohn of Bloomberg News. \u201cI have not been approached,\u201d said Perez, dodging the question. \u201cI like my day job. Actually, I love my day job, what I am doing every day. I have 245 days until the weekend. I have a little sign on my desk, not because I want to count the days but because I want to make all the days count.\u201d",

They have incredible talent,\u201d said Perez. \u201cTheir only mistake \u2013 if you want to call it a mistake \u2013 is that they were at a wrong place at a wrong time during the Great Recession.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/20/us-unemployment-jobs-doctor-thomas-perez\">The jobs doctor is in: US Labor secretary makes unemployment 'house calls'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On a cold, wet February morning, Perez met half a dozen New Jerseyans who were over 55 years old and had been out of work for an average of 1.8 years. The panel took place at Rutgers University, which had recently launched a \u201cNew Start Career Network\u201d focusing on older, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/20/us-unemployment-jobs-doctor-thomas-perez\">long-term unemployed workers</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFor them, it was hugely significant, the simple fact that the highest-ranking official in the country who deals with these issues took the time to talk to them about their experiences with long-term unemployment,\u201d Maria Heidkamp, director of the network, told the Guardian. \u201cIt was very meaningful to them.\u201d</p> <p>In the nearly four months since they met Perez, one of the attendees got a one-year contract.

After becoming the first Latino elected to the Montgomery County council and later serving as its president, Perez ran for attorney general of Maryland in 2006. However, his campaign <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/13/frontrunner-for-attorney-general-was-thrown-off-ballot-for-a-g-of-maryland.html\">came to a stop</a> after one of his rivals sued him alleging that he had not practiced law for 10 years and therefore did not meet the requirements to serve. That same year, Martin O\u2019Malley was elected as the state\u2019s governor and later appointed Perez to serve as the state\u2019s labor secretary. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In October of 2009, Perez joined the US Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division as assistant general attorney. While there he had investigated the death of Trayvon Martin, who was killed by George Zimmerman in February 2012, abuse at police departments in cities such as Miami and Seattle and civil rights violations by anti-immigration sheriff Joe Arpaio. In the summer of 2013, he was tagged by Barack Obama to run the US Department of Labor. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47b7c6f51408bfbe6040dbbc39de0ac71ba5b35c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47b7c6f51408bfbe6040dbbc39de0ac71ba5b35c/0_0_5760_2749/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Perez delivers Remarks to the Greater Baltimore Committee (GBC).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"477\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Perez delivers Remarks to the Greater Baltimore Committee (GBC).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn T Moore/US Department of Labor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To many of his supporters it comes as no surprise that since then, Perez\u2019s name has been floated for a number of other posts. When Eric Holder stepped down as US attorney general, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/10/tom-perez-attorney-general-obama\">Mother Jones ran a piece</a> headlined: \u201cWhy picking Tom Perez for attorney general would be a smart move for Obama\u201d. Earlier this year when the supreme court justice Antonin Scalia died, Perez\u2019s name came up in the pool of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fusion.net/video/272348/labor-secretary-tom-perez-reacts-to-possible-supreme-court-nomination/\">potential replacements</a>. </p> <p>The past few months have also seen speculation that Perez might end up as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate. Perez \u2013 who has at times joined Clinton on the campaign trail \u2013 insists he is focused on his day job.</p> <p>\u201cEvery engagement that I have had with him, he knows the number of days left in the president\u2019s term,\u201d said Henry. \u201cThe thing I admire in him is that even though speculation is happening, he remains laser-focused on trying to implement the fair pay and safe workplaces executive orders that we worked for six years to come to light. He is completely indefatigable on making sure that anything on his plate gets his full attention before he ends the term.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, while speaking to a room of journalists, Perez once again dodged a question about his possible vice-presidency. The comments came after he said mass deportation proposals floated by some Republicans \u201cwon\u2019t happen\u201d and added that he was confident the US government was going to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next year.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep demonizing the largest growing population in America and think that that\u2019s a good strategy for growth,\u201d he said, pointing to the naturalization movement in immigrant communities. \u201cImmigration reformation is long overdue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpoken like a vice-presidential nominee,\u201d quipped Bernie Kohn of Bloomberg News. </p> <p>\u201cI have not been approached,\u201d said Perez, dodging the question. \u201cI like my day job. Actually, I love my day job, what I am doing every day. I have 245 days until the weekend. I have a little sign on my desk, not because I want to count the days but because I want to make all the days count.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Meet Hugh Grant. No, not the famously charming Four Weddings and a Funeral actor, but the far more controversial self-described \u201cScottish optimist\u201d who is chairman and chief executive of US agrochemical company Monsanto, AKA \u201cthe most evil company in the world\u201d. It\u2019s a big weekend for Grant and Monsanto, a company that has been fighting against adverse publicity since its production of deadly herbicide Agent Orange in the 1960s and, more recently, its role at the forefront of genetically engineered crops. Now it is battling an unsolicited multibillion-dollar takeover from the German chemicals company Bayer that would create the dominant force in the world\u2019s food supply. It\u2019s a role reversal for Grant, who had overseen Monsanto \u2013 which also makes the controversial and probably carcinogenic Roundup weedkiller \u2013 during a series of takeovers by the agrochemical giant. Last month, one such attempt hit a roadblock when Monsanto dropped its long pursuit of the Swiss seed and pesticide maker Syngenta, losing to ChemChina. Grant told investors that Monsanto was better off alone. But, analysts say, Grant had left the firm vulnerable to a takeover itself. Earning forecasts had been cut, and the company was entangled in legal disputes across the world, sending its shares down almost 20% before news of the Bayer approach. \u201cIt\u2019s a relentless string of bad news,\u201d Jonas Oxgaard, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they forgot to sacrifice a goat to the gods.\u201d The news will get worse this weekend, when hundreds of thousands of activists join a day of coordinated marches against Monsanto in more than 400 cities across the world. In New York, campaigners promoted the march with a billboard in Times Square showing a topless model and the slogan \u201cKeep GMOs out of your genes\u201d. Grant, 57, is used to controversy. Born in Larkhall, near Glasgow, he has worked at Monsanto since he was 23, first in Scotland and in Asia before moving to the US and becoming president and CEO in 2003. He regularly faces protests from campaigners outside events, and even stars of the silver screen have been known to give him an earful. Just before Christmas, Oscar-nominated actor Mark Ruffalo accosted Grant in green room of CBS studios to tell him: \u201cYou are poisoning people. You are killing small farms. You are killing bees. What you are doing is dead wrong.\u201d Writing about the encounter, Ruffalo said he felt he had to approach Grant because he was \u201cbeside myself watching this guy who is responsible for so much misery and sickness throughout the world slime his way through his interview. I could not hold my tongue.\u201d Grant\u2019s reply: \u201cWhat I think we are doing is good.\u201d When protests are expected, Grant likes to be prepared. On the mornings of the company\u2019s always-fiery annual meetings, Grant, who is paid more than $11m (\u00a37.6m), makes arrangements for protesting shareholders to meet scientists and himself before taking their questions publicly at the meeting. At this year\u2019s meeting, Zen Honeycutt, founder of Moms Across America, who described him on her website as \u201cthe CEO of the Most Evil Company in the World\u201d, told Grant: \u201cI\u2019m imploring you to choose a new direction. Stop poisoning our children,\u201d in a reference to claimed links between Roundup and autism and cancer. Pointing out that he was a father of three, Grant, who holds molecular biology and agricultural degrees from Glasgow and Edinburgh universities, said various studies had shown there was \u201cno linkage\u201d between glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, and any human illnesses. However, the European Union this week delayed a vote on whether to continue to allow Roundup sales beyond June due to concerns that it could be carcinogenic. Concerns were led by France and Germany, and those countries are likely to lead a fight against the Bayer-Monsanto tie-up, which some fear could lead to more GMO crops and potentially dangerous pesticides entering Europe. \u201cGermans view Monsanto as the main example of American corporate evil,\u201d Heike Moldenhauer, a biotechnology expert at German environmental group BUND, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt may not be such a good idea to take over Monsanto, as that means incorporating its bad reputation, which would also make Bayer more vulnerable.\u201d Campaigners are also worried that the proposed takeover, which was made public by Monsanto late into the night on Wednesday just hours after a senior executive had dismissed rumors of an approach as \u201cwild speculation\u201d, will leave control of the world\u2019s food supply in too few hands. If Monsanto is bought (the price has not been made public, but it is said to be about $42bn) the combined Bayer-Monsanto will control 29% of the world\u2019s seed market and 24% of the pesticide market. \u201cA further concentration of corporate power in the agriculture/chemical sector would be bad news for farmers and consumers,\u201d said Franziska Achterberg, Greenpeace\u2019s EU food policy director. \u201cIt would accelerate the decrease in crop diversity while limiting consumer choice. Farmers would become even more dependent on just a handful of global players. They would find it harder to choose what they grow and how they grow it.\u201d Grant says the problem is that consumers have become too distant from the food they eat, with just 2% of the world\u2019s population involved in agriculture, and the food industry needs to do a better job of educating them about the challenges ahead. He told the Fortune Brainstorm E conference in California this week that to feed an ever-growing population, food production needed to double by 2050 while using roughly the same land area and trying to reduce water use. After playing defense, his aim now is to convince millennials of the need for more GM crops, which require less natural resources to grow. He\u2019s started by hiring more young people. \u201cWe have an enormous community of millennials, and they\u2019re there because they want to be there,\u201d he said. If you\u2019re interested in plant biology, the \u201cparty is at Monsanto\u201d.",

Stop poisoning our children,\u201d in a reference to claimed links between Roundup and autism and cancer. </p> <p>Pointing out that he was a father of three, Grant, who holds molecular biology and agricultural degrees from Glasgow and Edinburgh universities, said various studies had shown there was \u201cno linkage\u201d between glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, and any human illnesses.</p> <p>However, the European Union this week <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-eu-glyphosate-idUSKCN0YA1M1\">delayed a vote</a> on whether to continue to allow Roundup sales beyond June due to concerns that it could be carcinogenic. </p> <p>Concerns were led by France and Germany, and those countries are likely to lead a fight against the Bayer-Monsanto tie-up, which some fear could lead to more GMO crops and potentially dangerous pesticides entering Europe. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/05/monsanto-dow-syngenta-rush-for-mega-mergers-puts-food-security-at-risk\">Monsanto, Dow, Syngenta: rush for mega-mergers puts food security at risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cGermans view Monsanto as the main example of American corporate evil,\u201d Heike Moldenhauer, a biotechnology expert at German environmental group BUND, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt may not be such a good idea to take over Monsanto, as that means incorporating its bad reputation, which would also make Bayer more vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners are also worried that the proposed takeover, which was made <a href=\"http://news.monsanto.com/press-release/corporate/monsanto-comments-recent-media-reports\">public by Monsanto</a> late into the night on Wednesday just hours after a senior executive had dismissed rumors of an approach as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-monsanto-coo-idUSKCN0Y92JK\">\u201cwild speculation\u201d</a>, will leave control of the world\u2019s food supply in too few hands. </p> <p>If Monsanto is bought (the price has not been made public, but it is said to be about $42bn) the combined Bayer-Monsanto will control 29% of the world\u2019s seed market and 24% of the pesticide market. </p> <p>\u201cA further concentration of corporate power in the agriculture/chemical sector would be bad news for farmers and consumers,\u201d said Franziska Achterberg, Greenpeace\u2019s EU food policy director. \u201cIt would accelerate the decrease in crop diversity while limiting consumer choice. Farmers would become even more dependent on just a handful of global players. They would find it harder to choose what they grow and how they grow it.\u201d </p> <p>Grant says the problem is that consumers have become too distant from the food they eat, with just 2% of the world\u2019s population involved in agriculture, and the food industry needs to do a better job of educating them about the challenges ahead. </p> <p>He <a href=\"http://www.fortuneconferences.com/brainstorm-e-2016/\">told the Fortune Brainstorm E conference</a> in California this week that to feed an ever-growing population, food production needed to double by 2050 while using roughly the same land area and trying to reduce water use. </p> <p>After playing defense, his aim now is to convince millennials of the need for more GM crops, which require less natural resources to grow. He\u2019s started by hiring more young people. \u201cWe have an enormous community of millennials, and they\u2019re there because they want to be there,\u201d he said. If you\u2019re interested in plant biology, the \u201cparty is at Monsanto\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
