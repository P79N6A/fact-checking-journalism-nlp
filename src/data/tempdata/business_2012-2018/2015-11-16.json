      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has called in a leading law firm to help it deal with bribery allegations and a Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigation. Slaughter and May has been brought in while the SFO investigates allegations of bribery and corruption at the FTSE 100 engineer. Rolls-Royce was initially accused of paying bribes to win contracts in China and Indonesia, but it has also been linked to the corruption scandal facing Brazil\u2019s state-owned oil company Petrobras, and the SFO has said it is looking into several of the UK company\u2019s divisions. The news that Slaughter and May, one of the UK\u2019s top five law firms, is working with Rolls-Royce underlines the seriousness with which the company is treating the investigation, launched in December 2013. Rolls-Royce hired the New York law firm Debevoise &amp; Plimpton in 2012 to conduct an internal investigation after the SFO requested information from the company, after a whistleblower made allegations about its conduct in China and Indonesia. This investigation led to Rolls-Royce handing further information to the SFO, which launched a formal inquiry into the company. It is understood Slaughter and May was initially hired by Rolls-Royce two years ago as its joint legal counsel, meaning it worked for the company on financial transactions. However, it is now also advising Rolls-Royce on the corruption allegations, with leading litigation partners drafted in, and is thought to be the company\u2019s principal adviser. Slaughter and May has a history of helping major British companies deal with corruption allegations. It defended GlaxoSmithKline, Britain\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company, over an investigation into its conduct in Iraq during Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime. The firm\u2019s partners Richard Swallow and Jonathan Clark are working with the engine maker on the investigations. Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for the Airbus A380 superjumbo, has said it is cooperating with the SFO and authorities in Brazil investigating Petrobras. The company is facing one of the biggest challenges in its history. As well as the SFO investigation, Rolls-Royce has issued four profit warnings in the past year and faces calls to be broken up. ValueAct, an activist investor, has built a 5.4% stake in the company, and wants Rolls-Royce to sell off its marine division, badly affected by the decline in the oil price, to focus on producing engines for civil aeroplanes. Warren East, the new chief executive of Rolls-Royce, has rejected ValueAct\u2019s calls and refused to offer the investor a seat on the board. East will outline his strategy for Rolls-Royce at an investor day next Tuesday. However, he gave a glimpse into his plans last week when he issued another profits warning and said the company needed to cut costs to be more agile. Rolls-Royce blamed its profit warning on falling demand for corporate jets in Brazil, China and south-east Asia, a decline in maintenance and servicing revenues from its engines for large planes and energy industry customers being affected by the slump in the oil price. The Derby-based group now expects profit \u201cheadwinds\u201d of \u00a3650m next year, more than double the \u00a3300m cut to profits identified earlier in the year. In response, East wants to reduce costs by up to \u00a3200m a year at the same time as improving decision-making, which will lead to Rolls-Royce cutting jobs some of the 2,000 senior managers it employs around the world. Rolls-Royce is struggling largely as a result of investing in wide-bodied aircraft, such as the A380, at a time when demand is focused on narrow-bodied passenger plans. Rolls-Royce abandoned the narrow-bodied market in 2013 when it pulled out of a joint venture with its rival Pratt &amp; Whitney so it could focus on wide-bodied aircraft and the next generation of single-aisle planes that should follow the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max. Analysts at Agency Partners said Rolls-Royce faces \u201cexistential risks\u201d, including a decline in the use of its older engines \u2013 which will reduce the aftermarket sales that Rolls-Royce enjoys \u2013 and a general weakening in the aerospace market. The analysts said: \u201cThe last point is important, as the crisis to date has been largely specific to Rolls-Royce and has occurred against the background of unprecedented sustained strength in civil aerospace markets \u2013 overlaying a sector downturn on Rolls-Royce own crisis would make life yet more difficult. \u201cWe believe Rolls-Royce is well into a familiar aerospace and defence sector \u2018near death experience\u2019 pattern, which suggests that the shares have another 40% and six-plus months to fall.\u201d All parties declined to comment.",

Members of the special committee on tax rulings said they were concerned that major US businesses were paying virtually no tax in the EU countries where they operated, denying governments vital funds. The committee, which is investigating the scale of tax avoidance by multinationals, is backing proposals from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development that aim to make multinational corporations pay tax where they make their sales. The OECD\u2019s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) guidelines are the culmination of an international project launched two years ago by G20 governments in response to public anger over corporate tax avoidance. Almost 90 countries have been working together to create an agreed method of integrating the measures into the bilateral treaties already in place, potentially raising up to $250bn a year in extra tax revenue, according to the OECD.

    "webTitle": "Billions wiped off European travel shares after Paris attacks", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.4bn) was wiped off shares in European travel and hotel companies , as investors focused on concerns that the Paris attacks will hit tourism and consumer confidence across the continent. Shares in airline Air France-KLM, travel company Thomas Cook and their sector peers were down sharply on Monday, over fears the attacks and the prospect of tighter border controls would deter shoppers and holidaymakers from visiting Paris and other European cities. In Paris, Air France shares fell almost 6% and hotel company Accor lost 4.7%, while London-listed Thomas Cook sold off 4.8%. In total, \u20ac2.3bn was knocked off the value of travel and leisure shares as measured by the Stoxx Europe 600 Travel &amp; Leisure Index. As the European Central Bank expressed fears that the attacks might affect consumer spending, luxury brands also came under pressure from worries that Paris boutiques would see a drop off in visits from rich foreigners. There were stock market losses for Christian Dior, Hermes International and LVMH, home of Louis Vuitton and jeweller Bulgari. \u201cParis is one of the most important cities worldwide in terms of luxury spending, and the timing is not good too \u2013 a few weeks before Christmas, the most important period for retailers,\u201d said Gregoire Laverne, fund manager at Roche Brune Asset Management. However, European stock market indices shrugged off early losses on the belief that, tourism and shopping trips aside, the wider economic impact from Friday\u2019s events would not be severe. Economists at Citi investment bank said the attacks could hurt consumer confidence and tourism, but it was too soon to discern the scale of the impact across Europe. \u201cTourism and travel services are the sectors is where we would expect to see the largest adverse impact, with some substitution effects towards other destinations, perhaps elsewhere in France away from Paris, but more likely benefiting other European capitals, unless the phenomenon were to spread to other countries,\u201d they wrote in a research note. Beyond tourism-related stocks, the market impact was limited and some stocks even rose. Defence companies moved higher amid a step up in military activity in Syria. London\u2019s FTSE 100 closed up 0.5%, Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.05% and France\u2019s Cac index was only down less than 0.1%. There was a boost to shares from a growing view in markets that the ECB will step up its support for the bloc\u2019s economy as a result of the attacks. There was even market chatter that the US Federal Reserve could hold off raising interest rates there in December, contrary to firm signals that an increase is imminent. The US central bank had guided similarly about a September move, only to leave policy unchanged, blaming China\u2019s downturn. In the eurozone, the ECB hinted at concerns the attacks could knock consumer spending, which has been the main driver in the bloc\u2019s protracted and fragile recovery. The ECB\u2019s chief economist said policymakers would be watching the next consumer confidence figures closely, after the Paris attacks. \u201cUsually these sorts of events have a transitory effect on the economy so this is not a priori a reason to change the way we see the evolution of the European economy,\u201d Peter Praet told Bloomberg Television. \u201cIt\u2019s also true on the other hand that we have a fragile cyclical recovery, fragile with downside risk, and it\u2019s clear these sort of events do not help restoring confidence in the recovery, so this is something we will watch.\u201d The ECB has been propping up the recovery with ultra-low borrowing costs, alongside printing money in a massive quantitative easing (QE) programme. Even before the attacks, expectations had been building that the ECB would use its next policy meeting in December to unveil further support. Praet\u2019s comments bolstered that view. \u201cWhile the precise nature of next month\u2019s policy decision might previously have been still in the balance, after Friday evening\u2019s events in Paris we suspect that the ECB will now want to pull out all the stops in its easing, with a rate cut and extra QE now more likely to be on the cards,\u201d said economists Chris Scicluna and Mantas Vanagas at Daiwa Capital Markets.",

In total, \u20ac2.3bn was knocked off the value of travel and leisure shares <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/nov/16/markets-france-attacks-stock-markets-live#block-564a0988e4b0e98c91b0cf8c\">as measured by the Stoxx Europe 600 Travel &amp; Leisure Index</a>.</p> <p>As the European Central Bank expressed fears that the attacks might affect consumer spending, luxury brands also came under pressure from worries that Paris boutiques would see a drop off in visits from rich foreigners.</p> <p>There were stock market losses for Christian Dior, Hermes International and LVMH, home of Louis Vuitton and jeweller Bulgari.</p> <p>\u201cParis is one of the most important cities worldwide in terms of luxury spending, and the timing is not good too \u2013 a few weeks before Christmas, the most important period for retailers,\u201d said Gregoire Laverne, fund manager at Roche Brune Asset Management.</p> <p>However, European stock market indices shrugged off early losses on the belief that, tourism and shopping trips aside, the wider economic impact from Friday\u2019s events would not be severe. </p> <p>Economists at Citi investment bank said the attacks could hurt consumer confidence and tourism, but it was too soon to discern the scale of the impact across Europe.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cTourism and travel services are the sectors is where we would expect to see the largest adverse impact, with some substitution effects towards other destinations, perhaps elsewhere in France away from Paris, but more likely benefiting other European capitals, unless the phenomenon were to spread to other countries,\u201d they wrote in a research note.<br></p> <p>Beyond tourism-related stocks, the market impact was limited and some stocks even rose. Defence companies moved higher amid a step up in military activity in Syria. London\u2019s FTSE 100 closed up 0.5%, Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.05% and France\u2019s Cac index was only down less than 0.1%.</p> <p>There was a boost to shares from a growing view in markets that the ECB will step up its support for the bloc\u2019s economy as a result of the attacks. There was even market chatter that the US Federal Reserve could hold off raising interest rates there in December, contrary to firm signals that an increase is imminent.</p> <p>The US central bank had guided similarly about a September move, only to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/08/federal-reserve-almost-raised-interest-rates-september\">leave policy unchanged</a>, blaming China\u2019s downturn.</p> <p>In the eurozone, the ECB hinted at concerns the attacks could knock consumer spending, which has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/13/eurozone-recovery-loses-steam-as-germany-slows\">been the main driver</a> in the bloc\u2019s protracted and fragile recovery.</p> <p>The ECB\u2019s chief economist said policymakers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/nov/16/markets-france-attacks-stock-markets-live#block-564a020ee4b0e0595dc6c34c\">would be watching</a> the next consumer confidence figures closely, after the Paris attacks.</p> <p>\u201cUsually these sorts of events have a transitory effect on the economy so this is not a priori a reason to change the way we see the evolution of the European economy,\u201d Peter Praet told Bloomberg Television.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also true on the other hand that we have a fragile cyclical recovery, fragile with downside risk, and it\u2019s clear these sort of events do not help restoring confidence in the recovery, so this is something we will watch.\u201d</p> <p>The ECB has been propping up the recovery with ultra-low borrowing costs, alongside printing money in a massive quantitative easing (QE) programme.</p> <p>Even before the attacks, expectations had been building that the ECB would use its next policy meeting in December to unveil further support. Praet\u2019s comments bolstered that view.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the precise nature of next month\u2019s policy decision might previously have been still in the balance, after Friday evening\u2019s events in Paris we suspect that the ECB will now want to pull out all the stops in its easing, with a rate cut and extra QE now more likely to be on the cards,\u201d said economists Chris Scicluna and Mantas Vanagas at Daiwa Capital Markets.</p>",

Every single day. Precious metals worth an estimated \u00a313m are being flushed down our sinks and drains each year. All the more precious, perhaps, for lurking not in majestic and Oscar-friendly hill country but in our dark, stinking sewers. As Sam Dobbs, the grizzled prospector in John Huston\u2019s 1948 classic noted: \u201cAn ounce of gold, mister, is worth what it is because of the human labour that went into the findin\u2019 and the gettin\u2019 of it.\u201d To which we might add, the producin\u2019 of it. Gold, silver and platinum end up in sludge (the goo left behind from treating sewage) when we wash our hands (rubbing the rings on our fingers) and brush our (gold) teeth. Cars deposit traces of platinum in drains from catalytic converters and precious metals are increasingly used in shampoos, detergents and even in nanoparticles in clothes. The result, according to Thames Water analysis, is a level of gold in our sewage systems comparable to that found in working mines. Earlier this year, researchers from Arizona State University found that a city of a million people can produce around $13m (\u00a38.7m) worth of precious metals annually, including $2.6m in silver and gold. The question is how to get at it. At a sewage treatment facility in the industrial town of Suwa, north-west of Tokyo, they\u2019re attempting it already. Not by mining and crushing rock \u2013 the two biggest costs of traditional gold mining \u2013 but by incinerating sludge and processing the molten ash. In 2009, the plant, near a high concentration of precision equipment manufacturers that use precious metals, reported a yield of gold to rival production levels at the world\u2019s leading mines. It collected nearly two kilograms of gold in every ton of ash, worth nearly $200,00 a year. To compare, at Japan\u2019s Hishikari mine, one of the world\u2019s most productive, just 40 grammes of gold are found per ton of ore. As yet, no US or UK facilities have followed suit but, as gold prices rise, scientists continue to research methods of sifting sewage for tiny amounts of gold. These tend to involve the use of powerful chemicals known as leachates that are used by industrial operations to extract metals from rock. While they can be toxic to ecosystems, in the controlled setting of a sewage plant they can be safely used without environmental risk. The benefits over gold mining as we know it could be huge. Perhaps just as importantly, knowing that there\u2019s gold in them thar sewers completely changes the way we think about waste. Could it be that the home of sludge, Slimer, and giant fatbergs crafted from wet wipes, lard, and consumer guilt is in fact precious; something to be treasured and valued, worth its weight in, erm, gold?

Justin Apthorp retired as buying director on Monday but, in an unusual move, he will stay on the board as a non-executive director. He was in charge of buying a year ago when Majestic caused bad feeling with suppliers by asking them for payments to help fund its new warehouse in Hemel Hempstead. Rowan Gormley, who took over as Majestic\u2019s chief executive in April, said his recovery plan for the ailing chain needed the full support of suppliers. He set a target of \u00a3500m annual sales by 2019 compared with \u00a3182m in the first half of this year. In the six months to the end of September, Majestic\u2019s pre-tax profit fell to \u00a34.3m from \u00a38.5m a year earlier. Excluding costs from the Naked Wines acquisition and exceptional items, profit fell 1% to \u00a38.4m. Gormley said: \u201cThere was an impact on supplier relations last year when Majestic sent suppliers invoices for additional warehouse costs. Those kind of tactics are a thing of the past.\u201d Gormley, whose online Naked Wines business Majestic bought to secure his services, said Naked Wines had good supplier relationships and that he wanted this to apply across the group. Richard Weaver, Majestic\u2019s merchandising director, will become director of merchandising and buying. Majestic made its demands when retailers\u2019 treatment of suppliers was already in the news. Tesco\u2019s \u00a3264m profit warning last year was caused by failings in booking revenues charged to suppliers for promoting their products in stores. Debenhams sparked uproar with its suppliers before Christmas 2013 when it asked for a discount on own-branded goods as a contribution to its investment plans. Poor Christmas trading capped a string of disappointing results to force out Gormley\u2019s predecessor, Steve Lewis, last year. Majestic found itself squeezed by fierce discounting by supermarkets using wine promotions to lure customers through their doors. Gormley has said Majestic got trapped in a rut of cost cuts and bewildering discounts that damaged customer service and sales. He has slashed plans for more stores in favour of selling more wine at existing shops and has scrapped the chain\u2019s six-bottle minimum purchase, which harked back to its origins as a warehouse. Supermarkets are again using wine promotions to attract customers as Christmas approaches. Tesco is selling champagne for just \u00a39 a bottle and Waitrose has just finished offering 25% off all wine. Gormley said he was not worried about such offers because his plan was to reinvigorate Majestic\u2019s stores with clearer pricing that rewarded customers who spent more. He said shoppers and staff were already more upbeat after prices were simplified and the minimum purchase was done away with. \u201cI think we\u2019re in pretty good shape for Christmas,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Luxury goods stocks in France were also under pressure, including Hermes. Fund manager Gregoire Laverne at Roche Brune Asset Management told Reuters: \u201cParis is one of the most important cities worldwide in terms of luxury spending, and the timing [of the attacks] is not good too - a few weeks before Christmas, the most important period for retailers. These attacks will definitely have a long term negative effect on the tourism sector in France.\u201d But analysts at Societe Generale believe the effects on the luxury sector could be short-lived. They said: \u201cA negative short-term effect is inevitable \u2013 witness the sector\u2019s low European/French sales growth in the first quarter (January Paris attacks), followed by a rapid tourist-led pick-up. \u201cThe long term effect: negligible... if no further attacks: There should be limited lasting impact in a context where: a) economic growth is resuming at the macro level both in France and in Europe as a whole, and b) past history shows that such acts of terrorism as a rule have no lasting economic effects.\u201d On that note it\u2019s time to shut up shop for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. The predicted slump in stock markets in the wake of Friday\u2019s atrocities in France proved short lived. By the close of play in Europe most markets were in positive territory, with even France edging only marginally lower. Travel and leisure stocks came under pressure, inevitably, on concerns about the effect of the attacks on consumer sentiment, not to mention the prospect of border controls and increased security. But defence companies moved higher amid a step up in military activity in Syria. Commerzbank economist Peter Dixon told Reuters: \u201cThe markets have learnt to realised that the attacks tend to have very limited impact upon the economy and markets.\u201d Also adding support was the idea that the European Central Bank was even more likely to unveil further measures to stimulate the flagging eurozone economy at its meeting in December. There was even some talk the attacks could persuade the US Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates next month after all, despite an increase seeming a near-certain bet. Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, told AP Financial: \u201cAt this juncture, it is easy to see that the Fed\u2019s intentions to \u2018normalize\u2019 monetary policy could be derailed by a combination of adverse domestic economic and external events,.\u201d So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 28.10 points or 0.46% Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.05% to 10,713.23 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.08% at 4804.31 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.14% to 21,811.36 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.13% at 10,124.5 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 93 points or 0.54%. Back in Europe and nearly \u20ac2.3bn was wiped off travel and leisure shares by the close of play, as measured by the 23 constituents of the Stoxx Europe 600 Travel &amp; Leisure Index: Here\u2019s the full report from Bloomberg on the comments from ECB board member Peter Praet: Praet said the Paris terror attacks may pose a risk to the euro area\u2019s sluggish revival and policy makers will need to monitor data on economic confidence closely. \u201cUsually these sorts of events have a transitory effect on the economy so this is not a priori a reason to change the way we see the evolution of the European economy,\u201d Praet said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Monday in Frankfurt. \u201cIt\u2019s also true on the other hand that we have a fragile cyclical recovery, fragile with downside risk, and it\u2019s clear these sort of events do not help restoring confidence in the recovery, so this is something we will watch.\u201d The ECB already plans to discuss fresh stimulus measures next month as a global slowdown in trade threatens to stem the currency bloc\u2019s upturn and undermine an inflation rate that is stuck well below its goal.... Praet said policy makers will \u201cclosely\u201d study incoming economic data, in particular consumer confidence, over the coming days and weeks. Euro-area confidence indicators are due to be released by the European Union\u2019s statistics office on November 27. The ECB\u2019s next monetary-policy meeting is scheduled for December 3 in Frankfurt. Full report here. Early stock market falls have encouraged investors to come back in and buy at the lower levels, said Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG: Markets in Europe, the UK and the US have spent the day recovering losses, as investors digested the impact of Friday\u2019s events. Most European indices started the day firmly in the red, but since then we have seen these losses disappear, to be replaced with dip-buying. Across stock markets, travel firms have borne the brunt of the selling, with Carnival, TUI and Intercontinental Hotels all down in London today. Overall the economic backdrop has changed little from the end of last week, when indices took heavy losses, but it seems that once again many had simply been waiting for a sufficiently impressive run of losses to occur before buying once again. Investors have been attempting to work out what the aftermath of the events in Paris will be. Concerns are rife that tightened border controls will lead to lower economic growth, thus prompting the ECB to boost and/or lengthen its stimulus programme. Expectations of more easing have kept the euro around the key $1.07 mark, with today\u2019s inflation data doing little to hinder the view that the ECB will have to do more to boost the region\u2019s economy. The chief economist of the European Central Bank, Peter Praet, has told Bloomberg TV that the bank will be watching the next consumer confidence figures carefully in the wake of the Paris attacks. The bank has already hinted it might take further stimulus measures at its December meeting, to boost the flagging eurozone economy. Any signs of weakening confidence could make such a move more likely. After an early gain, crude prices are back in negative territory as worries about falling demand outweighed concerns about supply disruptions in the Middle East. Traders said that the Paris attacks were likel to have an impact on travel and thus demand for oil, while news that Japan had fallen back into recession reinforced the general perception of a slowing global economy. Meanwhile the average price of crude sold by Opec fell below $40 a barrel on Friday for the first time 2009. At the moment Brent crude is down 1.6% at $43.76 a barrel. US markets have moved ahead in early trading, despite the Paris attacks, with investors seeming to believe they will only have a short term economic impact. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 51 points or 0.29% while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed arouind 0.5%. Energy companies are providing some support, following an early rise in the crude oil price on concerns about supply disruptions. Here\u2019s some charts showing previous market reactions to acts of terrorism: Investors have knocked more than \u20ac2.5bn off the combined value of Europe\u2019s largest tourism firms so far today. Most of today\u2019s selloff has been focused on companies on the Travel &amp; Leisure portion of the STOXX 600 index, which has fallen by 1.5% today. Here\u2019s the top fallers: This underlines concerns that this sector will suffer from lower consumer confidence - despite France\u2019s determination not to be beaten. After a resolute start, the French stock market has now dipped back into the red. The CAC 40 is now down 25 points, or 0.5%, at 4,782. Air France\u2019s shares continue to lead the selloff - they\u2019re currently down almost 7% Hotel group Accor is also suffering, now down 5.2%, on predictions that tourism will suffer from the Paris attacks. Luxury group LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton is next, down 1.8%, followed by the major French banks - who might all be hit if economic confidence falls. CNBC is doing a fine job finding billionaires who aren\u2019t panicking over France. Wilbur Ross, whose investment firm is a big player in Europe, told the TV station that he doesn\u2019t expect markets to suffer heavy falls, saying: \u201cI don\u2019 t think this will provoke anything like a 10 percent market crack\u201d. CNCB has now published Warren Buffett\u2019s comments about France: Billionaire Warren Buffett said Monday the terrorist attacks in Paris won\u2019t change his investment decisions. \u201cI\u2019m not selling any securities because of the attacks in Paris, not at all,\u201d he said in a phone interview with CNBC. As for questions about whether the attacks would delay what many expect to be a Federal Reserve interest rate hike next month, Buffett said: \u201cWe never do anything based on what we think the Fed or the market is going to do in the next six months.\u201d Around two centuries ago, Nathan Rothschild apparently remarked that investors should buy on the sound of cannons, and sell when the victory trumpets are sounded. And unsentimental investors remember his advice today, buying into defence stocks today on anticipation of more military action in Syria. In the City, Rolls Royce shares are up 1.5% and BAE Systems have gained 2.2%. And French arms maker Thales has risen almost 2%. Warren Buffett, the world\u2019s third-richest man, says the attacks in France won\u2019t affect his investments: For decades, Buffett\u2019s investment strategy has been to buy solid companies with long-term prospects, and hold them. His Berkshire Hathaway group owns stakes in scores of the world\u2019s largest companies, including American Express, General Electric, Kraft Heinz and Coca-Cola. The euro has shed around 0.5% against the US dollar this morning, falling close to its lowest level since April. That\u2019s partly due to investors moving to \u2018safe-haven\u2019 currencies such as the US dollar and Japanese yen. It\u2019s also because eurozone monetary policy may be eased soon, to stimulate the eurozone economy. Vitor Const\u00e2ncio\u2019s concerns this morning suggest the ECB is likely to act, if conditions deteriorate. Here\u2019s what\u2019s up and down across the European markets today: Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, agrees that economic confidence could be hit: While the total human impact is immeasurable, the economic shockwaves to the French economy could include reduced investment, consumer spending and confidence for an economy that is already under pressure. The vice-president of the European Central Bank has warned that Friday night\u2019s terror attacks could hit investor confidence in Europe. Speaking at a conference Frankfurt, Vitor Const\u00e2ncio condemned the \u201cterrible events\u201d in Paris, and cautioned that: \u201cIt can compound all the problems that we were already facing. Markets are currently \u201ctaking it calmly\u201d so far, Const\u00e2ncio pointed out. But it\u2019s too early to know the economic cost of the attacks. He says: \u201cForthcoming events ... will impact confidence and possible risk aversion. (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) The eurozone economy remains quite fragile. Growth rate slipped to just 0.3% in the last quarter, which is slower than the UK (+0.5%). Inflation is just 0.1%, according to data released earlier today - which is why the ECB is expected to boost its bond-buying stimulus programme soon. City analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya, of London Capital Markets, explains why hotel and airline stock have fallen today: Rising terrorist threats will certainly impact tourist arrivals to big European cities as Paris, London and Berlin before the festive Christmas period. On the other hand, the rising geopolitical tensions between the West and the IS, the reinforcement of security measures in big European cities and the air strikes in Syria are expected to boost government spending on police and military and could give a bump to short-term domestic demand, she adds. More here: Leisure analyst Mark Brumby tweets that French consumer spending is likely to dip: The oil price has jumped around 1% this morning, helping to drive up shares in energy companies. This comes after United States warplanes attacked trucks used by ISIS to smuggle crude oil out of Syria, and France bombed ISIS\u2019s stronghold in Raqqa. Oil is usually a barometer of geopolitical tensions, especially anything that could disrupt supplies from the Middle East. There\u2019s general relief that markets are defying expectations and shrugging off the terror threat: Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, sums up the mood: \u201cEquity markets positive this morning, showing solidarity and resilience in the face of adversity with the Parisian bourse the standout performer in a message of unity to those who terrorized it this weekend.\u201d Investors had been braced for a volatile trading day - but in the event, there\u2019s less drama than feared (so far). Virtually every European travel stock is down today, with Air France leading the selloff: Here\u2019s resilience for you \u2013 the French CAC 40 just shrugged off all its early selloff, and is now slightly higher. Travel stocks are still being hit, with Air France now down 6% and Eurotunnel losing 4%. But other shares are picking up across Europe. Analyst at French bank BNP Paribas report that \u201cmarkets have opened generally cautiously after the tragic events in Paris\u201d. Kit Juckes, chief currency strategist at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, is hopeful that the country\u2019s economy will not be badly hit by Friday\u2019s attack: He writes: I am struck that the reaction to such atrocities has changed a lot since the attacks on New York, Washington DC, and the skies above America in September 2001. Then, we stood and stared, in shock. The US and the global economy were slowing before the World Trade Centre towers collapsed and the emotional reaction made sure the outcome was severe. But we\u2019ve moved on. More appalled than shocked. Simon Kuper, the FT journalist who lives in the 11e arrondissement near the Bataclan concert venue that was the epicentre of the tragedy, wrote that his 9-year-old daughter is calm because \u201cWe\u2019re used to this now\u201d. Children have a knack of getting straight to the point. Paris clearly lost a weekend of shopping and the retail sales figures will reflect that, but I\u2019d guess the effect will be temporary. The underground heading into the centre of London was packed when I headed out for dinner on Saturday and my impression is that while the outpouring of solidarity for Parisians is heartfelt, it won\u2019t get in the way of life. The same, I think (and hope) is true of Paris. Nothing will be quite the same, but Paris will still be beautiful and its people resilient. It does appear that Europe will avoid a major selloff this morning. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx reports: In a sign of resilience there is no sign of the panicked trading that could have been justifiably expected from the European indices. Not that share prices are important at a time like this, of course. But still, a muted response suggests that investors are broadly holding their nerve. Hotel group Accor dropped by 7% at the open. Luxury groups Hermes, LVMH and Kering, which get a large part of their sales from foreign tourists in Paris, were both down about 3%, Reuters points out. Travel stocks are bearing the brunt of this morning\u2019s selloff, reflecting concerns that European tourism will be hit by fears over terrorism. Air France\u2019s shares dropped 5% in early trading, while Eurotunnel is down over 3%. British Airways\u2019s parent company IAG is the biggest faller in London, down 4%. And other areas of the tourism sector are also seeing a reaction - with Intercontinental Hotels down 2.3%. Trading is underway at the French stock market, and shares are falling - but it\u2019s not a major rout. The CAC 40, made up of France\u2019s biggest blue-chip companies, has lost 1.1% at the open, as investors in Paris are get their first opportunity to react to Friday night\u2019s attacks. That\u2019s a slightly more muted reaction than feared over the weekend. Other European markets are down too, with Germany\u2019s DAX shedding 0.9%. Jameel Ahmad, chief market analyst at FXTM, says the Paris attacks are adding to worries over the global economy; Following the tragic events in France on Friday evening and after losses were noticed throughout the Asian markets overnight, expectations are high that the global markets are going to remain under pressure as trading for the week gets under way. The tragic events in France are likely to weigh on investor sentiment and will probably encourage some risk aversion from investors. Investor sentiment towards global markets was already looking shaky as last week concluded, and the recent events are going to weigh further on this. French government bonds are rising in value this morning - probably a sign that investors are a little more nervous. This has pushed down the interest rate, or yield, on French debt (yields fall when prices rise) The euro has weakened a little overnight (down 0.25%), reflecting concerns that Europe\u2019s already-fragile recovery is going to be knocked back. The gold price has gained 1%, though, to $1,095 per ounce: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European markets are expected to fall today, following Friday night\u2019s terror attacks in Paris. But it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ll see a major crash. The French market is, understandably, set to lead the sell-off, with concern that the country\u2019s tourism industry will suffer following Europe\u2019s worst terrorist attack in a decade. Paris\u2019s stock market, Euronext Paris, will open today - with tighter security. The CAC 40 index was originally predicted to plunge by around 4%. But the latest signs are that the CAC might only lose 1%, with traders refusing to be panicked. Shares have already fallen across much of Asia. Angus Nicholson of IG sums up the situation from Australia. After the terrible tragedy seen in Paris on Friday evening (and also the bombing in Beirut), markets have seen some of these fears play out in the financial world. There was noticeable buying in gold and safe-haven currencies such as the US dollar and Japanese yen. Oil also saw a bit of an increase off its two-and-a-half month lows from concern about what the Western response may mean for Middle Eastern oil production. Many markets opened down in Asia on the news, and futures were pointing down for European and American markets, although we did see this pull back somewhat as trade progressed throughout the day. All indications are that these negative moves would only be temporary and are likely to dissipate over the coming days. Money is already moving out of shares, and into safer assets such as German bunds. (GS = Goldman Sachs). Concerns over the global economy are also on the rise; overnight, Japan has slipped back into recession after shrinking by 0.2% in the last quarter: And European Central bank chief Mario Draghi is due to speak in Madrid this morning. He may touch on Europe\u2019s fragile recovery, after last Friday\u2019s GDP figures showed that growth slowed in the last quarter. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

By the close of play in Europe most markets were in positive territory, with even France edging only marginally lower. Travel and leisure stocks came under pressure, inevitably, on concerns about the effect of the attacks on consumer sentiment, not to mention the prospect of border controls and increased security. But defence companies moved higher amid a step up in military activity in Syria. Commerzbank economist Peter Dixon told Reuters: \u201cThe markets have learnt to realised that the attacks tend to have very limited impact upon the economy and markets.\u201d</p> <p>Also adding support was the idea that the European Central Bank was even more likely to unveil further measures to stimulate the flagging eurozone economy at its meeting in December. </p> <p>There was even some talk the attacks could persuade the US Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates next month after all, despite an increase seeming a near-certain bet. Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, told AP Financial: \u201cAt this juncture, it is easy to see that the Fed\u2019s intentions to \u2018normalize\u2019 monetary policy could be derailed by a combination of adverse domestic economic and external events,.\u201d</p> <p>So the final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li>The FTSE 100 finished up 28.10 points or 0.46%</li> <li>Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.05% to 10,713.23</li> <li>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.08% at 4804.31</li> <li>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.14% to 21,811.36</li> <li>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.13% at 10,124.5</li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 93 points or 0.54%.</p> <p>Back in Europe and nearly \u20ac2.3bn was wiped off travel and leisure shares by the close of play, as measured by the 23 constituents of the Stoxx Europe 600 Travel &amp; Leisure Index:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"979c8274c04974965d65a7f53e2c171467b408d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/979c8274c04974965d65a7f53e2c171467b408d2/0_0_1084_546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biggest fallers in Stoxx 600 Travel and Leisure Index\" width=\"1000\" height=\"504\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biggest fallers in Stoxx 600 Travel and Leisure Index</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-564a020ee4b0e0595dc6c34c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-16T16:22:24.142Z\">4.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s the full report from Bloomberg on t<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/nov/16/markets-france-attacks-stock-markets-live#block-5649f8bee4b0e98c91b0cf4b\"><strong>he comments</strong></a> from ECB board member Peter Praet:</p> <blockquote> <p>Praet said the Paris terror attacks may pose a risk to the euro area\u2019s sluggish revival and policy makers will need to monitor data on economic confidence closely.</p> <p>\u201cUsually these sorts of events have a transitory effect on the economy so this is not a priori a reason to change the way we see the evolution of the European economy,\u201d Praet said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Monday in Frankfurt. \u201cIt\u2019s also true on the other hand that we have a fragile cyclical recovery, fragile with downside risk, and it\u2019s clear these sort of events do not help restoring confidence in the recovery, so this is something we will watch.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The ECB already plans to discuss fresh stimulus measures next month as a global slowdown in trade threatens to stem the currency bloc\u2019s upturn and undermine an inflation rate that is stuck well below its goal....</p> <p>Praet said policy makers will \u201cclosely\u201d study incoming economic data, in particular consumer confidence, over the coming days and weeks.

Most European indices started the day firmly in the red, but since then we have seen these losses disappear, to be replaced with dip-buying.</p> <p>Across stock markets, travel firms have borne the brunt of the selling, with Carnival, TUI and Intercontinental Hotels all down in London today. Overall the economic backdrop has changed little from the end of last week, when indices took heavy losses, but it seems that once again many had simply been waiting for a sufficiently impressive run of losses to occur before buying once again.</p> <p>Investors have been attempting to work out what the aftermath of the events in Paris will be. Concerns are rife that tightened border controls will lead to lower economic growth, thus prompting the ECB to boost and/or lengthen its stimulus programme.

      "body": "<p>There is huge variation in fuel efficiency between transatlantic airlines, with British Airways and Lufthansa emitting 51% more carbon dioxide than the cleanest flyers, according to a report by the organisation that revealed the VW test-rigging scandal.</p> <p>Pollution from a non-stop transatlantic round trip averages around one tonne of CO2 per passenger, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theicct.org/\">International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT)</a> research found \u2013 the same as would be clocked up in a year by commuting 22 miles to work daily in a Toyota Prius.</p> <p>Separately, a leaked European parliament study seen by the Guardian has forecast that the aviation and shipping industries will make up 39% of global CO2 emissions by 2050, based on present trends. </p> <p>The ICCT report said a typical passenger on Norwegian Air Shuttle travelled 40km per litre of fuel, while flyers on British Airways and Lufthansa travelled only 27km.</p> <p>Dan Rutherford, an author of the report, said: \u201cEighty per cent of the difference can be explained by two factors: seating configurations \u2013 how much premium, business and first-class seating you have \u2013 and the fuel burn of an aircraft, or how efficient it is. Norwegian Air Shuttle has invested more in newer, more fuel-efficient planes, while BA is using older, predominantly 747 aircraft.\u201d</p> <p>First-class and business passengers accounted for a disproportionate amount of the pollution. Premium passengers were responsible for 14% of available seat kilometres flown on transatlantic routes, but they accounted for around one-third of total carbon emissions, the paper found.</p> <p>Other poor performers in the study included United Airlines, Virgin Atlantic and American Airlines, who scored barely above BA and Lufthansa. At the other end of the table, Air Berlin, KLM and Aer Lingus averaged 36km per litre of fuel.</p> <p>Rutherford said the results, which will be filed with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (Icao), showed a deterioration from last year\u2019s rankings, which revealed a 25% difference between best and worst performers.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a large and underestimated potential for in-sector CO2 emission reductions,\u201d the report states. \u201cThis highlights the role for additional policies to limit aviation emissions, notably the CO2 standard being developed by the Icao and a global market-based measure to price aviation carbon.\u201d</p> <p>International airlines and shipping companies are not currently obliged to cut their CO2 output.

      "bodyText": "There is huge variation in fuel efficiency between transatlantic airlines, with British Airways and Lufthansa emitting 51% more carbon dioxide than the cleanest flyers, according to a report by the organisation that revealed the VW test-rigging scandal. Pollution from a non-stop transatlantic round trip averages around one tonne of CO2 per passenger, the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) research found \u2013 the same as would be clocked up in a year by commuting 22 miles to work daily in a Toyota Prius. Separately, a leaked European parliament study seen by the Guardian has forecast that the aviation and shipping industries will make up 39% of global CO2 emissions by 2050, based on present trends. The ICCT report said a typical passenger on Norwegian Air Shuttle travelled 40km per litre of fuel, while flyers on British Airways and Lufthansa travelled only 27km. Dan Rutherford, an author of the report, said: \u201cEighty per cent of the difference can be explained by two factors: seating configurations \u2013 how much premium, business and first-class seating you have \u2013 and the fuel burn of an aircraft, or how efficient it is. Norwegian Air Shuttle has invested more in newer, more fuel-efficient planes, while BA is using older, predominantly 747 aircraft.\u201d First-class and business passengers accounted for a disproportionate amount of the pollution. Premium passengers were responsible for 14% of available seat kilometres flown on transatlantic routes, but they accounted for around one-third of total carbon emissions, the paper found. Other poor performers in the study included United Airlines, Virgin Atlantic and American Airlines, who scored barely above BA and Lufthansa. At the other end of the table, Air Berlin, KLM and Aer Lingus averaged 36km per litre of fuel. Rutherford said the results, which will be filed with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (Icao), showed a deterioration from last year\u2019s rankings, which revealed a 25% difference between best and worst performers. \u201cThere is a large and underestimated potential for in-sector CO2 emission reductions,\u201d the report states. \u201cThis highlights the role for additional policies to limit aviation emissions, notably the CO2 standard being developed by the Icao and a global market-based measure to price aviation carbon.\u201d International airlines and shipping companies are not currently obliged to cut their CO2 output. An attempt to include aviation in the EU\u2019s emissions trading system was defeated two years ago. Icao says it will try for carbon neutral growth after 2020, but expects no new policies before an assembly in November 2016. The projections in the leaked European parliament study suggest that aviation and shipping will continue to increase their share of global emissions. It predicts that by 2050 aviation will account for 22% of the total, and shipping 17%. \u201cClearly this would derail the efforts in Paris to stay within two degrees\u2019 warming,\u201d said Sotiris Raptis, a shipping policy officer at Transport &amp; Environment. \u201cAny deal in Paris must lead to an emissions reduction target for aviation and shipping, like all other sectors of the global economy.\u201d Airline emissions are currently responsible for an estimated 5% of global warming, and the shipping industry around half that, and both figures are growing fast. Globally, aircraft emitted about 700m metric tonnes of CO2 in 2013, and without policy intervention that figure is expected to triple by 2050.

      "bodyText": "The mother of two children killed by a faulty boiler at a hotel booked through Thomas Cook says she has set aside her feelings about the treatment of her family by the tour operator to launch a charity promoting safer tourism. Sharon Wood appeared in public with Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive for the first time since the company apologised in May for the deaths of Christi and Bobby Shepherd in 2006. The children, aged seven and six, from Horbury, near Wakefield, died from carbon monoxide poisoning at a bungalow attached to Corfu\u2019s Louis Corcyra Beach hotel. Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive for the past year, promised to right the wrongs of the past nine years when he met Wood and the children\u2019s father, Neil Shepherd. Thomas Cook launched the Safer Tourism Foundation with a \u00a31m donation to fund research and raise awareness of travel risks, in particular the dangers of carbon monoxide. Fankhauser said the operator would insist that by next summer hotels using fossil fuel fired water heaters connected directly to rooms must go through proper checks and have a carbon monoxide alarm. Thomas Cook faced widespread criticism after the inquest into the children\u2019s deaths, when a jury concluded it was unlawful killing and said the company had breached its duty of care. A report commissioned by Thomas Cook from former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s Justin King, criticised the company\u2019s treatment of Wood and Shepherd, whose campaign for justice was largely ignored by the company. Appearing at a conference on carbon monoxide at the Houses of Parliament to launch the foundation on Monday, Wood said her children died on holiday with her ex-husband because Thomas Cook did not know enough about the hotel. She said she and Shepherd, who was in the audience, had spent a decade fighting for justice. Sitting next to Fankhauser and reading from a handwritten statement, Wood said: \u201cThe way in which one of the largest and most respected tour operators has treated Christi and Bobby\u2019s family is well documented, hard to forgive and impossible to forget. \u201cI [have] put my personal feelings to one side. All we ever wanted was to understand why Christi and Bobby lost their lives and to make sure it didn\u2019t happen again. We have to work with Thomas Cook. We have to take the best way forward to make progress.\u201d The conference, organised by the Labour MP for Wakefield, Mary Creagh, heard how little had been done nationally or at a European level to protect people from carbon monoxide poisoning, especially when travelling abroad. Research by the foundation found that 35% of European consumers thought incorrectly that carbon monoxide, which is invisible and odourless, could be detected by human senses and only 5% had worried about it when going on holiday. Wood said the UK government should be ashamed of its failure to raise awareness of the dangers of carbon monoxide and called on Abta, the travel industry\u2019s trade group, to make sure warnings were in all brochures. \u201cWhat we need is a prime-time awareness campaign sponsored by the gas industry and the government.\u201d Fankhauser, who will chair the foundation, said he would take guidance on its activities from Wood, who will be a trustee. He said the initial \u00a31m funding was to launch the charity and the aim was to make it self-funding. He said: \u201cThis may sound surprising but I believe that this is a positive day for Thomas Cook. The dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning have been closely associated with our company in the last year. \u201cI am deeply grateful to be sitting here next to Sharon Wood. She has agreed to work with Thomas Cook to build the new charity, the Safer Tourism Foundation, in memory of her children Christi and Bobby Shepherd. I would personally like to thank Sharon for her grace in such awful circumstances and for putting her trust in me to help make a new start.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marriott International is buying its rival Starwood, owner of the W and Sheraton chains, for $12.2bn (\u00a38bn) in a deal that will create the world\u2019s largest hotelier. The new company would own 5,500 properties and more than 1.1m rooms, uniting Starwood brands including Westin, Le M\u00e9ridien and St Regis with Marriott\u2019s two dozen brands including Courtyard, Ritz-Carlton and Fairfield Inn. The next largest hotel company is Hilton Worldwide, which has 4,400 properties and about 720,000 rooms. The stock and cash deal, if completed, is expected to add 50% more rooms to Marriott\u2019s portfolio and give it more unique, design-focused hotels that appeal to younger travellers. The groups said the tie-up would provide substantial economies of scale. The transaction is valued at $72.08 per Starwood share, representing a premium of about 19% on the share price before the merger rumours surfaced. The announcement on Monday is further evidence of a mergers and acquisitions boom in the US. M&amp;A deals in the country this year have surpassed $2tn, up 55% on the same period last year, with the technology and pharmaceuticals sectors leading the way. In April, Starwood announced its board was exploring strategic options. The company has struggled to grow as quickly as its rivals, particularly in \u201climited service hotels\u201d \u2013 smaller properties without restaurants or banquet halls. They are often located near highways and airports or in suburban office parks. There had been speculation about a potential deal with the Holiday Inn owner Intercontinental Hotels Group, and more recently Hyatt Hotels. The Marriott deal comes amid record hotel occupancy and rates. During the first nine months of the year, guests filled 67.3% of the available rooms in the US, according to STR \u2013 the highest level since the research firm started collecting data in 1987. Guests have been paying an average of $120.35 a night; the previous record, adjusted for inflation, was $119.70 in 2008. Marriott, based in Bethesda, Maryland, has been growing aggressively. In April, it acquired Delta Hotels and Resorts, making it the largest hotelier in Canada. The Marriott and Starwood boards approved the acquisition unanimously; it must now be approved by the chains\u2019 investors. Arne Sorenson, Marriott\u2019s president and chief executive, will take the same role in the combined company, whose headquarters will be in Bethesda. Marriott\u2019s board of directors is to increase from 11 to 14, with the expected addition of three members of Starwood\u2019s board. Marriott said it expected to deliver at least $200m in annual savings in the second full year after the deal was completed. The merger will carry one-off costs of between $100m and $150m. Following news of the deal, Starwood shares fell 5.45% in a sector hit by the terrorist attack in Paris on Friday night. \u201cThis is a terrible deal for Starwood shareholders,\u201d analyst Jim Cramer said on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street. Another analyst was less damning. \u201cWhile the reasons behind the falling stock prices of each may be more to do with the weekend\u2019s tragic events than today\u2019s deal,\u201d said Connor Campbell, a senior market expert at spreadex.com, \u201cthe takeover does intensify the pressure on the UK\u2019s hotel companies (led by InterContinental) as they try to fight off the increasing market power of this new Marriott/Starwood mash-up\u201d. Between the two groups, the merged company would own about 14% of all US hotel rooms, although its proportion of higher-end rooms would be greater.",

      "bodyText": "Japan just cannot seem to get its economy growing. The latest drop in GDP marks the country\u2019s fourth descent into recession in five years. It is a blow to the prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, who came to power in 2012 vowing to stamp out deflation and bolster a flagging economy with his so-called Abenomics policies. Two recessions on from his electoral victory, it is becoming clear that for all the excitement around Abenomics when it launched, the plan is doing little in practice. The idea was that three arrows would tackle chronic problems in the world\u2019s third largest economy. They were looser monetary policy from the Bank of Japan (BoJ), a fiscal boost from increased spending on public works and sweeping structural reform to make the economy more productive and competitive. What Japan\u2019s policymakers are learning is that if the three \u201carrows\u201d of Abenomics are to work at all, they have to work together. Using the first two arrows of easier money and more spending to buy time and ease the path for the third, more difficult, arrow of reform has failed. By holding back on tackling longstanding problems such as sluggish private sector investment and labour shortages, Abe and his government have dampened the effectiveness of the other two arrows. Construction workers wanted Take the example of fiscal stimulus. The government hopes to boost spending and create a better environment for businesses with big building projects, yet a shrinking workforce means it struggles to find construction workers to do the building. In other words, it is like putting fuel in car and then trying to drive off with the handbrake on. The two arrows of fiscal and monetary stimulus are being dampened by a host of such brakes. Jobs outnumber applicants The population problem is chief among them. Similar to other advanced economies such as Germany, Japan is struggling with an ageing workforce in which more people are retiring than joining. The population started shrinking four years ago, while its working age population has been falling since the mid-1990s and is projected to drop much further still. Japanese employers simply cannot find enough workers. It is by far the toughest country to fill a vacancy, according to a recent report covering more than 40 states by the recruitment company ManpowerGroup. In Japan, 83% of employers said they were struggling to hire, more than double the global average of 38%. Hiring headaches The government says it is tackling the population problem with plans for better childcare and tax incentives for parents. But like neighbouring China, which recently announced it was scrapping its one-child limit, Japan will face a long wait for such birth rate policies to bear economic fruit. In the meantime, its small tweak to immigration policy has done little to boost the workforce. Another challenge, again shared by other advanced economies, is the downturn in China, Japan\u2019s biggest trading partner. Weaker demand for exports, owing to troubles in China and a wider global economic slowdown, are compounding the already cautious mood among Japanese businesses hurt by a sluggish domestic outlook. The gloomy private sector wants more government support for the economy. Abe and his colleagues fire back that they want business to play its part in hauling Japan out of the doldrums. The government is calling on Japanese firms to spend some of their record cash piles on higher wages and more capital spending. The third arrow of change is undoubtedly the toughest. But after the fourth recession in five years, it is clear that just pouring on the easy money is not the answer for Japan.",

      "bodyText": "Japan\u2019s recovery is being held back by a shortage of skilled labour, a leading minister has claimed, after the world\u2019s third-largest economy entered its fourth technical recession in five years. Economics minister Akira Amari said a lack of workers available for public works projects worth billions of pounds restricted the government\u2019s ability to bolster the economy. Amari urged Japanese firms to use their record cash holdings to raise wages and increase capital spending to generate sustainable growth led by the private sector, instead of relying on government to always take the lead. He added that Tokyo was not considering a fresh stimulus. The plea for big business to support the recovery came as official data on Monday showed Japan\u2019s economy shrank by an annualised 0.8% in July to September after a deeper than previously estimated 0.7% contraction in the previous three months, providing the two consecutive quarters of declines needed to mark a recession. Analysts said labour shortages were a significant feature of an ageing population in a country that had put severe restrictions on immigration. But the government maintained its cautiously upbeat outlook, saying that despite a downturn in national income during the summer and autumn, an improved outlook for jobs and wages would mean a return to growth later in the year. \u201cWhile there are risks such as overseas developments, we expect the economy to head toward a moderate recovery thanks to the effect of the various [stimulus] steps taken so far,\u201d Amari said. He blamed a big reduction in stock levels for the dip in the third quarter and excluding this effect, said the economy expanded by an annualised 1.4%. Structural reform to support business investment is the third arrow in the country\u2019s recovery plan, dubbed Abenomics after the prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe. Izumi Devalier, an economist at HSBC, was also upbeat about the prospects for the economy, saying there were \u201cpositive trends that reflect the economy\u2019s continued progress in exiting deflation\u201d. \u201cPrivate consumption rebounded strongly on the back of improved real labour income. Meanwhile, nominal GDP continues to rise on the back of firm domestic price pressures and a better terms of trade,\u201d she added. \u201cThe bad news is that corporates are not yet convinced that the reflationary trend is here to stay, keeping capital expenditure weak. But this issue cannot be addressed through short-term stimulus alone.\u201d Japan has been stuck in a deflationary economic slump since a property and banking crash in the early 1990s. Under Abe\u2019s reforms, the government has increased its spending to regularly run a budget deficit of about 10%. This has been matched by aggressive action by the Bank of Japan to drive down borrowing costs to business and households with extra quantitative easing. But structural reforms have proved more difficult to implement and business investment has lagged. The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell in November to its lowest reading since April 2013. The service sector index fell in October to its lowest since March, dragged down by wholesalers and retailers. Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas Securities: \u201cAbenomics\u2019 first two arrows of monetary and fiscal stimulus were meant to buy time, but Japan failed to make progress with painful reforms needed to boost its growth potential. Without reform [the \u2018third arrow\u2019], the economy\u2019s growth potential remains low, making it vulnerable to shocks and to suffering recessions more often.\u201d Private consumption, which accounts for about 60% of Japan\u2019s GDP, rose 0.5% from the previous quarter. But capital expenditure fell 1.3%, more than the 0.4% decrease expected by economists.",

The chief executive, Pete Redfern, acknowledged on Monday that conditions were perfect for housebuilders, with a shortage of housing and rising demand as wage growth started to outpace inflation. But he said there was no need to fear a housing bubble: \u201cWhile the market has been healthy, it\u2019s not taken off as it has in previous years, it\u2019s more sustainable. We\u2019re not saying the housing market is not cyclical but the cyclicality seems more muted. It\u2019s a good market, not a rampant one.\u201d The firm\u2019s rate of sales this year is 0.76 per outlet per week, up from 0.66 at this stage last year, as the traditionally weaker summer months proved better than usual. Taylor Wimpey is closely watching the progress of the housing and planning bill to see whether the right regime is put in place for new \u201cstarter homes\u201d that sell for 20% below market rate. Redfern said the details of the bill would determine whether starter homes, which have faced criticism that they are not genuinely affordable, were an opportunity or a risk for developers. Strong demand for housing has helped Taylor Wimpey to a record order book of 8,546 homes to build, worth \u00a32.1bn, in the year to date. The firm echoed reports of rising labour costs due to a shortage of skilled labourers, with the cost of building a house up 5%. But it said pressure was easing thanks to an increased focus at the company on apprenticeships and graduate trainee schemes. It expects to have net cash of \u00a3220m at the end of the year, after paying out \u00a3308m in dividends to shareholders. The prospect of rising interest rates should not derail the firm\u2019s progress, it said, with customers showing resilience to tighter monetary policy. \u201cAgainst a backdrop of rising real incomes and tighter mortgage regulation with good availability and affordability, we believe that consumers have resilience to future interest rate movements.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s inflation rate is expected to have remained in negative territory when official figures are released on Tuesday, leaving the Bank of England in little hurry to start raising interest rates. Economists expect data for October to show the inflation rate as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) held at -0.1%, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll. Inflation has been at or close to zero for most of this year and first dipped into negative territory in April when prices fell for the first time in more than 50 years. The rate has been pulled down sharply by a combination of tumbling global commodity prices, from oil to food, and the effects of a strong pound, which makes imports cheaper. Martin Beck at the consultancy Oxford Economics expects those factors to keep the inflation rate at -0.1% in the latest figures. There should also be some downward pressure on inflation as the effects of higher university fees fade. \u201cPrice growth is continuing to be depressed by the strong pound and cheaper imports. And the effect of the tripling of university tuition fees, which came into effect in 2012, will finally drop out of the annual comparison in October, taking, all else equal, 0.2 percentage points off annual inflation,\u201d said Beck. While some have described low inflation as a sign of economic fragility, it relieves the pressure on household budgets after several years of wages falling in real terms following the financial crisis. BoE governor Mark Carney has sought to reassure households that the UK is not headed for all-out deflation, where widespread price falls become entrenched. Economists echoed that ahead of these latest figures. Chris Hare, economist at Investec, is forecasting a -0.1% reading in this week\u2019s figures but says there are three reasons why it will not herald the start of a \u201cpersistent deflationary episode\u201d. \u201cFirst, most of the fall in the inflation rate was driven by falls in volatile clothing and energy prices. Second, inflation has been very stable recently \u2026 Third, as the effects of past energy price falls, import price softness \u2013 from strength in the pound \u2013 dissipate, and as domestic labour costs continue to build, inflation should start picking up markedly at the turn of the year,\u201d he said. Below target For the Bank, low inflation has meant there is little immediate pressure to increase borrowing costs from their record low. The Bank is set an inflation target of 2% by the government, but the rate has been below that since the start of 2014. The Bank says it expects inflation to stay close to zero for the rest of this year and rise only slowly next year. Many economists predict that outlook and an uncertain picture for global growth will hold the Bank back from increasing interest rates for some time. But Carney has said it is \u201creasonable\u201d for households to expect a rate rise over the coming 12 months and some forecasters say the Bank could raise rates as soon as February. Waiting for lift-off Interest rates in the UK and US were slashed during the global financial crisis and only now are central bankers poised to raise them back to more normal levels. The US Federal Reserve has indicated it will raise interest rates from close to zero at its December policy meeting. In the UK, interest rates have been at the record low of 0.5% for more than six years. Carney and his colleagues have emphasised that when borrowing costs do start to rise - something financial markets have dubbed \u201clift-off\u201d - they will do so only gradually and peak at a lower point than in the past.",

      "bodyText": "There are many checks and balances within a newspaper. There is the original author, the news or commissioning editor, and a system of revising the work of subeditors. While this is happening, lawyers will be checking for any legal problems. But mistakes still happen. George Monbiot is an award-winning columnist who is not afraid to challenge vested interests. His 30 October column, headlined \u201cIndonesia is burning. So why is the world looking away?\u201d, has had more than 1.3m page views. It is a forceful condemnation of the world\u2019s apparent apathy when \u201ca great tract of the Earth is on fire\u201d. He specifically mentions the clearing of land for \u201cpulpwood, timber and palm oil\u201d plantation as a cause of the fires. He refers to the major international companies that use palm oil. He says some have promised to stop \u201cdestroying the rainforest\u201d and the article says: \u201cSome companies using palm oil have made visible efforts to reform their supply chains; but others seem to move more slowly and opaquely. Starbucks, PepsiCo and Kraft Heinz are examples. Don\u2019t buy their products until you see results.\u201d However, in his original copy, that paragraph included Unilever, which was removed from the published version in print and online. Monbiot only became aware when the article had been published that the company\u2019s name had been removed. He was concerned because of the commercial relationship between the Guardian and Unilever, and the way its removal might be read. There has been no complaint to the readers\u2019 editor. But, for the record, readers should know what happened. Monbiot filed his copy 24 hours beforehand with a series of embedded links, including one to Testing Commitments to Cut Conflict Palm Oil, a Rainforest Action Network report published in May 2015. In it the well-established international NGO discusses the progress of a number of companies in moving away from non-sustainable palm oil sources to truly sustainable ones. It identifies a group it defines as \u201claggards\u201d in terms of progress. Among those are the three companies named in Monbiot\u2019s published column. Although Monbiot\u2019s copy was filed early, it was only during the editing process in the late afternoon that a night lawyer was sent his article. The version the lawyer saw did not contain the links Monbiot had embedded, including to the Rainforest Action Network report. However, while making a quick check of all four companies, the lawyer discovered a 2014 \u201csustainable palm oil progress\u201d report by Unilever charting its activities to source \u201call our palm oil from traceable and certified sources\u201d. In that report the company says that a substantial part of its use of palm oil is covered by the offset system of GreenPalm certificates. The report\u2019s contents led to a discussion in which it was decided to remove Unilever\u2019s name from Monbiot\u2019s column. None of those involved in that decision were aware of any commercial relationship with Unilever. By then it was close to deadline. An email was sent to Monbiot at 8.51 pm, which mentioned \u201csmall\u201d cuts but did not specify what they were. Because the column was comment, none of the companies named were approached before publication. When I spoke to Monbiot last week he said: \u201cIn May 2015, the Rainforest Action Network published a survey of major companies using palm oil and their progress in sorting out their supply chains. It listed a number of companies among the \u2018laggards\u2019 \u2026 four of them are probably known to most readers: Kraft, Heinz (these two companies have now merged to form a single conglomerate), PepsiCo and Unilever. So these were the ones I listed. I was trying to be dispassionate in doing so, ignoring Unilever\u2019s deal with the Guardian in order to treat it as I would treat any other company.\u201d The Rainforest Action Network report praises Unilever as being \u201cconsidered by many as the first company to recognise its conflict palm oil problem \u2026 However, it is now lagging behind its peers \u2026 it has failed to move beyond purchasing GreenPalm certificates. Unilever\u2019s reliance on GreenPalm certificates remains a critical shortfall in its approach, as this offset model does not directly improve the practices of the companies from which it sources palm oil.\u201d I think there was, regrettably, a number of small but collectively significant miscommunications within the Guardian that led to Unilever incorrectly being omitted from the article in print and online and therefore, in fairness, I shall restore its name to the online story.",

Among those are the three companies named in Monbiot\u2019s published column.</p> <p>Although Monbiot\u2019s copy was filed early, it was only during the editing process in the late afternoon that a night lawyer was sent his article. The version the lawyer saw did not contain the links Monbiot had embedded, including to the Rainforest Action Network report. However, while making a quick check of all four companies, the lawyer discovered a 2014 \u201csustainable palm oil progress\u201d report by Unilever charting its activities to source \u201call our palm oil from traceable and certified sources\u201d. In that report the company says that a substantial part of its use of palm oil is covered by the offset system of <a href=\"http://greenpalm.org/\" title=\"\">GreenPalm</a> certificates.</p> <p>The report\u2019s contents led to a discussion in which it was decided to remove Unilever\u2019s name from Monbiot\u2019s column. None of those involved in that decision were aware of any commercial relationship with Unilever.</p> <p>By then it was close to deadline. An email was sent to Monbiot at 8.51 pm, which mentioned \u201csmall\u201d cuts but did not specify what they were. Because the column was comment, none of the companies named were approached before publication.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/nov/11/indonesia-forest-fires-explained-haze-palm-oil-timber-burning\">Indonesia's forest fires: everything you need to know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I spoke to Monbiot last week he said: \u201cIn May 2015, the Rainforest Action Network published a survey of major companies using palm oil and their progress in sorting out their supply chains. It listed a number of companies among the \u2018laggards\u2019 \u2026 four of them are probably known to most readers: Kraft, Heinz (these two companies have now merged to form a single conglomerate), PepsiCo and Unilever. So these were the ones I listed. I was trying to be dispassionate in doing so, ignoring Unilever\u2019s deal with the Guardian in order to treat it as I would treat any other company.\u201d</p> <p>The Rainforest Action Network report praises Unilever as being \u201cconsidered by many as the first company to recognise its conflict palm oil problem \u2026 However, it is now lagging behind its peers \u2026 it has failed to move beyond purchasing GreenPalm certificates. Unilever\u2019s reliance on GreenPalm certificates remains a critical shortfall in its approach, as this offset model does not directly improve the practices of the companies from which it sources palm oil.\u201d</p> <p>I think there was, regrettably, a number of small but collectively significant miscommunications within the Guardian that led to Unilever incorrectly being omitted from the article in print and online and therefore, in fairness, I shall restore its name to the online story.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of BT\u2019s contentious Openreach business has resigned to run Nationwide, the country\u2019s biggest building society. Joe Garner will join Nationwide in spring 2016, replacing Graham Beale as chief executive of the customer-owned lender. The appointment of Garner, a former HSBC banker, is unusual for Nationwide, whose last three chief executives came from within the company. It will also mean that the top two posts at the society will be filled by ex-bankers. David Roberts, Nationwide\u2019s chairman, is a former Barclays banker and was deputy chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. Garner joined Openreach, which builds and maintains BT\u2019s vast copper and fibre network, in February 2014 and has spent much of his time trying to ward off criticism and regulatory intervention over poor service standards and lack of competition. He is likely to leave while BT is caught up in the most wide ranging review of competition in the telecoms sector for a decade. BT\u2019s rivals are calling for Openreach to be separated from its parent as part of the inquiry when the regulator Ofcom reports on its findings. Ofcom has said it will publish its preliminary thoughts on the question early in the new year, promising Garner a busy end to his time at BT. BT is required to provide access to its network on equal terms to its competitors through Openreach\u2019s fibre broadband network. But competitors for broadband business such as Sky and TalkTalk have claimed a conflict of interest that gives Openreach no incentive to cut prices while customers have complained about long delays in getting broadband cables installed. Vodafone\u2019s chief executive, Vittorio Colao, claimed last week that BT was trying to use Openreach to create a new monopoly of the retail telecoms market, which BT dominates. Garner has said it would be a big mistake to split Openreach from BT and that he has been working to improve service. Garner said: \u201cI\u2019ve greatly enjoyed my time at Openreach and deciding to leave has been an extremely hard decision, but Nationwide is a firm I long-admired during my time in financial services. \u201cIt is BT\u2019s investment that has helped the UK to become one of the strongest digital economies in the world and I am proud to have contributed. Openreach is now poised to take the UK from a superfast to an ultrafast nation and I am confident it can achieve this as part of the BT family.\u201d Before joining BT, Garner ran HSBC\u2019s UK bank for two years and was in charge when regulation of the banking sector stiffened. He rose through the ranks after joining HSBC in 2004 and won recognition for increasing HSBC\u2019s UK market share, particularly of mortgages, when other banks were weakened. Garner left HSBC in September 2012 because he was reluctant to move overseas for the bank and was reported to be a candidate to run Royal Bank of Scotland and the Co-operative Group. Earlier in his career he worked for Dixons, the electrical retailer, and Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer goods company. The move to Nationwide will take Garner back to financial services but working for Britain\u2019s biggest mutual lender. Beale, who announced his departure in May, has criticised changes to the banking levy, made partly to appease HSBC, that have increase costs for building societies. Roberts said: \u201cAs a member-owned organisation, our sole focus is to deliver exceptional products and services to our members at every stage of their lives. Joe has an excellent track record in delivering outstanding service to customers across the financial services and retail sectors,\u201d Beale has led Nationwide since 2007 and steered the society through the financial crisis of 2008. Garner will be paid about the same as Beale, whose \u00a32.6m pay last year attracted controversy for being far more than at any other building society.",

Leading the losers was the Nikkei index in Japan which tumbled nearly 1.3% as official figures showed that the country\u2019s economy had entered recession for the fifth time in seven years. The widely tracked CBOE volatility index or \u201cfear gauge\u201d was at its highest level since 2 October and bourses in Australia, South Korea and Hong Kong all saw substantial falls of more than 1% in early trading. In Europe, futures trade pointed to sharp falls in the main markets with the FTSE100 predicted to be down 40 points or around 0.6% at the open and the Dax in Germany down 1%. The French financial markets were due to open as usual on Monday, with extra security measures taken for staff, stock and derivatives, the Euronext exchange said. The CAC40 French bourse was set to open 2% lower on Monday. With concerns about how European leaders would respond to the Paris attacks, the euro was sold heavily in Asian trading and fell to a six-month low of $1.071. Global security concerns were better news for some commodities, however, as Brent crude oil was up 1% at $44.92 a barrel after shedding 1% on Friday. US crude was up about 0.54% at $40.96 a barrel. Gold added about 0.5% to stand at $1,091.96 an ounce. \u201cRisk aversion is on the rise and we are seeing broad-based U.S. dollar strength across the board and this may continue until the year end as recent economic data has also disappointed,\u201d said Mitul Kotecha, head of Asian FX and rates strategy at Barclays in Singpore. The Japanese economy contracted by a worse than expected 0.8% on an annualised basis in the third quarter. That followed a revised 0.7% contraction in the previous quarter, fulfilling the technical definition of a recession which is two back-to-back quarterly contractions. It is the fifth time Japan has entered recession since 2008, a so-called \u201cquintuple dip\u201d. However, the prospect of more monetary stimulus in Japan on the back of the poor growth figures served to boost traders and the indices climbed back towards positive territory in the afternoon. \u201cThe headline was weak, but the market is shifting to expectations for more measures,\u201d said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management. By 6.30amGMT, the Nikkei was down 1%, the Korean Kospi was 1.53% lower and the Hang Seng was down 1.5%. The Shanghai Composite had fallen 0.6%. The Australian benchmark ASX/S&amp;P200 closed almost 1% lower.",

Against the backdrop of waning global demand and pressure on UK competitiveness from a strong pound, manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF says its members are worried that Osborne\u2019s new round of austerity will add to their uncertain outlook. The chancellor unveils his comprehensive spending review on 25 November when he will set out tighter budgets for government departments. Fearing that will mean less support for manufacturers, EEF echoes the business group CBI in demanding the government increases backing for Innovate UK, the body which supports business research and hi-tech development. The manufacturing lobby group also wants Osborne to ensure UKTI, the export support agency, gets adequate funding. \u201cFamine and feast is not good. We\u2019ve got an ecosystem that manufacturers are starting to understand and the UK is becoming more competitive internationally,\u201d said EEF chief economist Lee Hopley. \u201cWe are not looking for emergency measures, but a stable, predictable business environment.\u201d Publishing EEF\u2019s submission to the Treasury before the spending review, the group\u2019s chief executive Terry Scuoler said the government had built up a successful track record of helping businesses turn ideas into commercial successes. \u201cWhile we recognise the difficult fiscal environment the government faces, reducing spending on innovation would harm efforts to improve productivity, which is the key to longer term economic stability,\u201d he said.",

The chancellor unveils his comprehensive spending review on 25 November when he will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/nov/06/2015-comprehensive-spending-review-public-services\">set out tighter budgets for government departments</a>. </p> <p>Fearing that will mean less support for manufacturers, EEF echoes the business group CBI in <a href=\"http://news.cbi.org.uk/news/cbi-calls-on-government-to-prioritise-innovation-spending-from-cuts/\">demanding the government increases backing for Innovate UK</a>, the body which supports business research and hi-tech development. The manufacturing lobby group also wants Osborne to ensure UKTI, the export support agency, gets adequate funding.</p> <p>\u201cFamine and feast is not good. We\u2019ve got an ecosystem that manufacturers are starting to understand and the UK is becoming more competitive internationally,\u201d said EEF chief economist Lee Hopley. \u201cWe are not looking for emergency measures, but a stable, predictable business environment.\u201d</p> <p>Publishing EEF\u2019s submission to the Treasury before the spending review, the group\u2019s chief executive Terry Scuoler said the government had built up a successful track record of helping businesses turn ideas into commercial successes. \u201cWhile we recognise the difficult fiscal environment the government faces, reducing spending on innovation would harm efforts to improve productivity, which is the key to longer term economic stability,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Some retailers hand over as little as 10p per pack of Christmas cards to charity, according to an investigation that reveals a huge variation in the amount given to good causes from each pack sold. The consumer group Which? looked at 13 major retailers and supermarkets for their charity Christmas card offerings this year. At what appears to be the least generous end of the scale, the Co-op gives nearly 7% (10p) of its \u00a31.50 cards to food poverty and food bank charity FareShare, while Lidl gives the equivalent of 8% (10p) of a pack price to children\u2019s cancer charity CLIC Sargent. WH Smith donates 100% of the price of its BBC Children in Need charity cards, but for others which it sells, only 10% or 20% is donated. At the same time, Aldi and John Lewis branded cards donate 25% to the charities they support. John Lewis also sells a range of other charity cards where 10% is donated. However, Morrisons has pledged to donate \u00a350,000 to the Sue Ryder chain of charity shops, regardless of how many packs of its charity cards are sold. Tesco is also selling a range of charity cards and donating a total of \u00a3300,000 to Diabetes UK and the British Heart Foundation. Of other major retailers, Asda said that it is not selling charity Christmas cards this year. Marks &amp; Spencer is giving 20% to Unicef, Macmillan and Breakthrough Breast Cancer. The full investigation is published in the December issue of Which? magazine. Which? editor Richard Headland said: \u201cThere are real differences between how retailers donate to good causes, so people may want to look out for this if they are planning to buy charity cards this festive season.\u201d Retailers often print what percentage of the sale price goes to charity on the packet, but not how it compares to other shops. A spokeswoman for Lidl said its charity Christmas cards were only one aspect of its support for its charity partner CLIC Sargent, for which it is on target to have donated a total of \u00a31m by the end of 2016. \u201cWe have a multi-faceted approach to raising money for the charity\u2019s important work and we review it every year\u201d, she said. The Co-op also defended its record. \u201cWe are a major supporter of charities and good causes and fundraise in a number of ways,\u201d said a Co-op spokesperson. \u201cAll the proceeds from all our bags for life sales will go to local good causes and as well as giving 10p per Christmas card to Fareshare we are providing them with all our depot surplus food, providing a million meals a year. This Christmas our festive sandwich sales will also result in a \u00a350,000 donation to our official charity of the year partner, The British Red Cross and we aim to raise millions of pounds for them over the next two years.\u201d For several years the Guardian\u2019s Money section has highlighted how little of the purchase price of Christmas cards goes to the charity concerned. A Royal Mail spokesman said there was no sign that Britons intended to cut back on sending Christmas cards this year, despite the rise of e-cards and people choosing to make charitable donations directly. A recent survey carried out by One Poll indicated people in the UK intend to continue sending Christmas cards, the spokesman said: \u201cOver two thirds (68%) of those asked said they will be sending the same number of Christmas cards as they did last year, and 10% plan to send more.\u201d The survey was carried out in October 2015 and saw 2,000 adults \u201cwho celebrate Christmas\u201d respond.",
