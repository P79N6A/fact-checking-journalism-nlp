It should achieve \u00a31bn sales this year and it is the trailblazer for a new breed of UK retailer that sees expansion overseas as a task to be tackled early in life. But read yesterday's half-year numbers and you'll be struck by how ordinary Asos is in two important ways. First, there is no cheap route to growth. The cost of upgrading warehouses, IT systems and websites was the prime reason why pretax profits fell 22% to \u00a320.1m despite a one-third advance in sales to \u00a3481m. All that investment is necessary if Asos is serious about being able to handle sales of \u00a32.5bn a year one day. But it's a reminder that internet-only retailers of clothes do not enjoy miraculous economics. Asos's capital expenditure bill of \u00a368m this year will be substantially larger than last year's net income of \u00a341m. Second, profit margins of 7% (last year's figure) are good but not exceptional. Nor does Asos expect a big leap forward: the medium-term ambition is 8%. So crunch the numbers and assume that the \u00a32.5bn sales target is achieved four or five years from now. Asos would be making profits of about \u00a3200m, or about \u00a3150m after tax. On today's share price, that would be about 28 times earnings, which sounds more sober than the current rating of 85 times 2014's expected earnings. But it's a ratio for several years away and assumes the global rollout runs perfectly, which is far from guaranteed. When you're selling everywhere from Shanghai to St Petersburg to Seattle, there will be hiccups. For true believers, it seems, no rating is too high when there is a whiff of global leadership in the air. For everybody else, Asos's valuation is too much, too soon.",

      "bodyText": "An investor rebellion has forced Sports Direct to scrap a share bonus scheme that could have handed the retailer's billionaire founder, Mike Ashley, free shares worth \u00a372m. The company on Wednesday called off a meeting set for Friday when shareholders were due to vote on the scheme. It is the second time that the company has tried and failed to win support from investors for a multimillion-pound share award for the group's deputy chairman. Ashley receives no salary or bonus but he owns 62% of the company, a stake worth approximately \u00a33.3bn. The latest share scheme was proposed after Sports Direct was forced to scrap another plan when shareholders protested ahead of its 2012 annual general meeting. The retailer's board said on Wednesday it was disappointed that it could not muster the required support from shareholders for its plan to grant Ashley 8m shares that would have paid out in 2018. Dave Singleton, non-executive director and chairman of the retailer's remuneration committee, said: \"While the board is disappointed that this resolution will not now be passed, we respect shareholders' views. We remain convinced of the benefit of aligning Mike Ashley's interests with those of all other shareholders.\" The board's retreat came after a call with shareholders on Wednesday which led Singleton to admit that: \"While we had the support of some of our largest shareholders, we had not been able to secure the requisite level of shareholder approval.\" Odey Asset Management, Sports Direct's biggest institutional shareholder, backed the payout, but it is thought other shareholders did not believe that the targets Ashley had to achieve to get the award were stretching enough. One analyst, who declined to be named, said: \"Shareholders felt that the targets for this bonus scheme were not forward looking enough. The first target was close to the consensus for the year to April 2014, which is nearly over, and the next for April 2015.\" Those reservations meant that the board could not win the backing of investors holding more than 50% of the company's stock which was not under Ashley's control. However, the board will now put forward a third proposal for a bonus for Ashley at its shareholders meeting in September. In a change of tactics, Ashley would participate in the company-wide bonus scheme which is open to all \"eligible\" employees \u2013 although that excludes 90% of the retailer's shop-floor staff who are on zero-hours contracts. Further details will be revealed in a letter to shareholders. The overall scheme would grant initial options to eligible staff on more than 25m shares in the group, or about 4.2% of its stock. The payout would be conditional on Sports Direct achieving underlying profits of \u00a3480m in 2016, \u00a3570m in 2017 and \u00a3650m in 2018. That compares with anticipated underlying profits for this year of \u00a3272m. Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United football club, may not receive a salary from Sports Direct, but his personal worth has soared as the company has won favour with investors in recent years and he is listed by Forbes magazine as the fifth richest Briton. After a shaky start on the stock market in 2007, Sports Direct's shares have nearly tripled in price, taking the company's total value to nearly \u00a35.35bn. Ashley, whose career in retail began when his parents lent him \u00a310,000 to open his own shop, remains the driving force behind the business. He was behind the company's purchase in January of an option to buy shares in Debenhams, putting pressure on the department store group to stock Sports Direct's brands. He has also overseen the acquisition of a string of brands including Karrimor and Head as well as international businesses which have taken the company right across Europe. With more than 600 sports stores in Europe, including 400 in the UK, Sports Direct is Britain's biggest sports retailer. It expanded strongly during the economic downturn as it benefited from the failure of rivals such as JJB Sports. Ashley has long had a tricky relationship with rival sports retailers after handing the Office of Fair Trading evidence in 2000 of business meetings held by sports retailers to fix the price of football shirts.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vince Cable is under intense pressure to name the \"priority investors\" that sold their Royal Mail stakes almost immediately after the privatisation making \"huge profits\" at the expense of taxpayers. Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, has written to the business secretary, demanding that he publish the names of the 16 priority investors, six of whom sold all of their shares within weeks of flotation. Umunna's formal request for Cable to name the investors given preferential access to shares by the government comes after Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the prime minister of presiding over a sale of the 500-year-old national institution at \"mates' rates to his friends in the City\". Miliband branded Cameron the \"dunce of Downing Street\" for allowing Royal Mail to be dramatically undervalued, costing taxpayers \u00a3750m in a single day according to the National Audit Office. \"It is basic maths. Not so much the Wolf of Wall Street more the dunce of Downing Street. A third of the shares were sold to just 16 City investors and there was a gentleman's agreement that those City investors wouldn't sell the shares.\" Cable said: \"There was no agreement - gentleman's or otherwise \u2026 we did not seek to lock them in as they would have paid less for a stock they could not trade.\" In a scathing report this week the audit office said the government's desperation to attract \"long-term, blue chip\" institutional investors led to the shares being underpriced. The NAO said the government gave the select group priority access to the shares, which were in huge demand from public, because of its \"expectation that they would form part of a stable long-term and supportive shareholder base\". At the time, Cable said: \"We wanted to make sure that the company started its new life with a core of high quality investors who would be there in good times and bad, interested in Royal Mail and the universal service it provides for consumers over the long term.\" By the end of January 2014 just 12% of the company's shares were held by the \"priority investors\". The proportion is understood to have fallen even further since. The government and Royal Mail have refused to name the priority investors or reveal how much profit they made from selling their shares. Cable said a substantial majority of the shares are still held by long term institutional investors. Standard Life has revealed that it has sold 99% of the 12m Royal Mail shares it bought in the October flotation. \"Standard Life Investments are long term investors,\" the company said. \"However we have to respond to changing valuations and share prices and thus where appropriate (we) reposition portfolios to achieve the best returns for our clients.\" The pension fund and investment manager refused to state how much profit it made from selling its Royal Mail shares. However, it would have made at least \u00a315m if it sold all of the shares on the first day following a 38% jump in the share price from the 330p flotation price. If Standard Life had sold them at their 618p peak in January it would have made a profit of \u00a334.5m \u2013 almost doubling its money in three months. \"Taxpayers have been left hugely short changed by the government's Royal Mail fire sale,\" Umunna said in his letter to Cable. \"The NAO's report this week revealed that 16 priority investors allocated the largest stakes of Royal Mail shares - and which the government claimed would provide long-term stewardship and stability for the privatised company - sold almost half of their shares within weeks, making huge profits as a result.\" He also asked the government to publish all correspondence between the government, its banks and the investors in the runup to the sale.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lord Myners is facing an uphill struggle in the coming days to persuade members of the loss-making Co-operative Group to endorse his plans to overhaul its board and replace it with a plc-style structure. Myners, who was chairman of Guardian Media Group before being elevated to the Lords to become City minister, is sending representatives to a series of crucial regional meetings in the next 48 hours to set out his plans, which were raced out last month in the wake of the resignation of the Co-op Group chief executive Euan Sutherland. Myners is suggesting scrapping the current board \u2013 made up of five members of the independent co-operatives, 15 members elected from all walks of society and himself, an independent member \u2013 and replacing it with something more akin to a plc-style board: more firmly in the control of a chief executive and chairman. Members \u2013 who effectively own the Co-op chain of supermarkets, funeral parlours and pharmacies \u2013 would then be represented by a national members council. But Patrick Gray, the elected president (chairman) of the Midcounties Co-operative, Britain's biggest independent customer-owned retailer, said that the 7 million members of the Group should continue to have a direct voice on the main board. \"There needs to be more time to introduce reforms that need to be based on the principles of co-operative democracy,\" said Gray, ahead of the publication of a comment piece on the Guardian's website. \"Power must be put back into the hands of members by guaranteeing democratic best practice, opening governance up to a broad range of energetic, experienced, elected directors capable of holding management to account,\" Gray will say in his comment piece. The Myners team's presentations to the regional boards \u2013 who control 78% of the votes at annual meetings of the Co-op Group \u2013 come ahead of a crucial period with the publication of its financial results on 17 April and its annual meeting on 17 May. The South East board meets tonight and the Scotland and Northern Ireland board on Friday and there is speculation their members, drawn from all walks of society and elected locally, are not prepared to endorse Myners's proposals. The Group is thought to be waiting until after its results \u2013 expected to show losses of at least \u00a32bn \u2013 to publish the full plans drawn up by Myners, who was appointed as an independent director following the furore caused by Paul Flowers scandal at the Co-op bank. Gray, who chairs the board of the Midcounties whose chief executive Ben Reid has a seat on the Co-op Group board, will also suggest the regions should be spun back out of the Group as \"self governing societies within a federal framework\". Reid last week called for caution before the full Myners report was published, saying the co-operative model was \"alive and well\". Gray will say in his comment piece that the co-operative movement should widen its political influence outside the Co-operative Party, which has 32 MPs in Westminster who sit alongside Labour MPs. \"We must accept that we are no longer living in the 1920s: while the Co-operative movement must always have a voice in politics, we must now reach out to all who share our principles across the political spectrum,\" said Gray. The vote on the Myners's proposals is expected to take place separately from the annual meeting in May, at some point in the summer. Sources familiar with the situation said that a very small proportion were opposed to change while others were acknowledging change was needed.",

      "bodyText": "For years the London borough of Brent was synonymous with Wembley stadium and Ken Livingstone's constituency when he was an MP. It included some of the capital's most deprived areas, and was once dubbed the drive-by-shooting capital of the UK. However, Brent residents, and more particularly those in the trendiest part of the borough, Queen's Park, woke on Wednesday to the fact that their small corner of north-west London last year witnessed Britain fastest rising house prices. Homes here outpaced the oligarch and banker hotspots of Chelsea, Westminster, and even Knightsbridge. Developers, foreign buyers, and a large number of families downshifting from the nearby and super-expensive Notting Hill area, have, according to agents, sent prices to hitherto unimaginable heights. Price increases in Queen's Park have made millionaires of thousands of residents. Nazir Shah, of Lewis Estates, in Queen's Park, said: \"It has been crazy in recent months, shocking. A couple of months ago we sold a two-bed flat that is due to complete on Friday for \u00a3560,000. If we put it back on the market today it would make \u00a3625,000, if not more. \"Houses that sold for \u00a31.1m a few months ago are already worth \u00a31.35m, and prices have been moving up so fast it's become very difficult to value houses. We've been asking the vendors what they hope to get, and unless their valuation is crazy, putting it on for that amount. Sealed bids are commonplace, with the winner often paying \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000 over the asking price.\" Across the road at the agents Queens Park Partnership, Alan Isaacs said the area had increasingly become the hot choice for London's well-off families spurred by its good transport links, wide tree-lined streets, park, and strong community. He said houses that sold for \u00a3155,000 in 1990 were now fetching in excess of \u00a31.4m. Renting a house in the area now cost a minimum of \u00a31,000 a week. Price increases in Queen's Park have sent a ripple through the borough, helped by the gentrification of nearby Kensal Rise and Willesden Green. Even Harlesden, once infamous for its shootings, is hugely on the up. \"If you're feeling brave now's the time to buy in Harlesden. It's only going one way,\" said one agent.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland is closing 44 branches in a move that campaigners fear will damage local communities. Customers have been told about the closures \u2013 across the UK from Scotland to the south coast of England - and 14 of them are \"the last branch in town\". There has been no public announcement. Banks have been pledging not to be last to pull out of local communities since the furore caused by Barclays a decade ago, when it closed 171 branches on one day. RBS formalised its pledge in its \"customer charter\" in 2010, but in 2012 the advertising watchdog upheld a complaint about misleading promises by RBS to be the last branch in town. By 2013 it had watered down the commitment. Derek French, who runs the campaign for community banking services, said the decision to close some of the RBS branches could encourage rivals to start shutting down branches where they were the last in town. \"It is very concerning,\" said French. RBS closed 60 branches in the whole of 2013. The closures come as the new chief executive of RBS, Ross McEwan, attempts to haul the 81% taxpayer-owned back into the black after reporting losses of more than \u00a38bn for last year. Unite's national officer Rob Macgregor said: \"Taxpayers who bailed out RBS have a right to be angry that it is quietly embarking on a programme of mass branch closures. While RBS senior executives get millions of pounds in payouts, there are communities up and down the country being denied access to a local bank. There has been no proper consultation and there is a real fear that these closures will hurt the communities affected.\" He said the chancellor, George Osborne, should intervene, as one of the branches earmarked for closure was in his Tatton constituency, in Chelford. A spokesperson for RBS said there had been a 30% drop in branch transactions since 2010, adding: \"Many branches classed as 'last bank in town' are only open for a few hours a week and only see one or two customers per hour. \"We have to adapt to what our customers want, which is why we're investing in a range of other ways our customers can bank with us, including online and telephone banking, our mobile app, and in any one of the Post Office's 11,500 branches across the UK.\"",

Then the news with the closure of a two-day meeting of European Union finance chiefs in the Greek capital, that Germany is now actively discussing ways of boosting growth in the bloc\u2019s most indebted member state. \u201cWe have, bilaterally as well as in the Euro group, occupied ourselves with, and pushed hard for making the improvement of growth conditions in Greece increasingly the focus of efforts,\u201d Schauble told reporters at the end of the meeting. \u201cWe are in talks with the Greek government that we, together with the Eurogroup [of euro area finance ministers], bundle the different measures to improve growth conditions in an action plan.\u201d Schauble\u2019s revelation comes amid the growing realization that if Europe is ever to get back on its feet it will need to redress its social problems first. No other country is more emblematic of the collateral damage caused by austerity than Greece, currently best by record levels of poverty and joblessness.</p> <p>With Berlin determined to convey the message that the euro debt crisis is over the German finance minister also told Greek public TV: \u201cYou are exiting the crisis, the economy is recovering.\u201d</p> <p>Ahead of crucial euro parliament elections in May, officials signalled that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel would also reward \u201cher friend the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras\u201d with a visit to Greece next week.</p> <p> \u201cShe will be visiting for a few hours on April 11,\u201d a government source said. \u201cIt will be more of a visit of thanks, to show Greeks that with this government and this prime minister, their country has pulled through.\u201d Germany, like most other EU states, are concerned about the prospect of political instability should Samaras' fragile coalition do badly in the polls</p> <p>Merkel last visited Athens (her first visit ever) in October 2012. She was greeted by mass demonstrations, furious slogans and more than a few Greeks, dressed in SS garb, likening her to Adolf Hitler.

(<i>NB, the ECB meets tomorrow amid growing hints that either negative deposit rates or bond buying could be on the agenda</i>.) She said the Bank of Japan should also persist with its quantative easing policy.</p> <p>In the emerging markets, there is the risk of heightened market volatility due to the tapering of quantitative easing in the US.</p> <p>The final obstacle is rising geopolitical tensions. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The situation in the Ukraine is one which, if not well managed, could have broader spillover implications.

That was slightly below estimates of 195,000 but still showed a rebound after the severe weather earlier in the year hit the economy. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s report was widely expected to show less intense effects of adverse weather on job creation in March and a similar improvement is also expected to be confirmed by the Bureau of Labour Statistics non-farm payroll data out on Friday. As such, we rule out that an over-200,000 non-farm payroll will have a massive impact on bond prices.</p> <p> The ADP and Bureau of Labour Statistics private payrolls are not always perfectly aligned. That said, today's ADP report clearly points in the direction of further improvement in job creation in March. The services sector seems to be the major contributor to job growth in March, with additional 164,000 jobs over the month. This is the strongest reading since November 2013, with services payrolls reflecting more the business cycle rather than the weather-related swings. Goods producing payrolls were little changed in March, up by 28,000 from 25,000. Most of the latter is explained by a rather solid construction sector that added 20,000 jobs over the month.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarketWatch/statuses/451365227054264320\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ADP said private sector firms added 191,000 jobs in March, the most in three months. <a href=\"http://t.co/WPuHHn1Q74\">http://t.co/WPuHHn1Q74</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/lepsLUwzA5\">pic.twitter.com/lepsLUwzA5</a></p>&mdash; MarketWatch (@MarketWatch) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarketWatch/statuses/451365227054264320\">April 2, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-04-02T14:35:50.886Z\">at 3.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-533c0bb4e4b01f464063df59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-02T13:42:52.741Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the vexed question of UK productivity, this is what the ONS had to say.</p> <ul> <li> <b>Productivity continues to lag despite recent moves of workers from industries with low levels of output per hour to those with higher output.</b><br></li> <li>The ONS call this the \"reallocation effect\" and estimate that it has added 1.5 percentage points to UK productivity growth between 2008- 2013.</li> <li>But UK output per hour is still 4.3% below its take.</li> </ul> <p>In case you missed it, take a look at <b>Katie Allen</b>'s recent report on UK productivity and why it matters.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More importantly for pay, only with productivity growth can earnings keep growing.

Then the news with the closure of a two-day meeting of European Union finance chiefs in the Greek capital, that Germany is now actively discussing ways of boosting growth in the bloc\u2019s most indebted member state. \u201cWe have, bilaterally as well as in the Euro group, occupied ourselves with, and pushed hard for making the improvement of growth conditions in Greece increasingly the focus of efforts,\u201d Schauble told reporters at the end of the meeting. \u201cWe are in talks with the Greek government that we, together with the Eurogroup [of euro area finance ministers], bundle the different measures to improve growth conditions in an action plan.\u201d Schauble\u2019s revelation comes amid the growing realization that if Europe is ever to get back on its feet it will need to redress its social problems first. No other country is more emblematic of the collateral damage caused by austerity than Greece, currently best by record levels of poverty and joblessness. With Berlin determined to convey the message that the euro debt crisis is over the German finance minister also told Greek public TV: \u201cYou are exiting the crisis, the economy is recovering.\u201d Ahead of crucial euro parliament elections in May, officials signalled that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel would also reward \u201cher friend the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras\u201d with a visit to Greece next week. \u201cShe will be visiting for a few hours on April 11,\u201d a government source said. \u201cIt will be more of a visit of thanks, to show Greeks that with this government and this prime minister, their country has pulled through.\u201d Germany, like most other EU states, are concerned about the prospect of political instability should Samaras' fragile coalition do badly in the polls Merkel last visited Athens (her first visit ever) in October 2012. She was greeted by mass demonstrations, furious slogans and more than a few Greeks, dressed in SS garb, likening her to Adolf Hitler. This time, Athens is likely to be under lock-down for most of her stay. And on that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Ahead of the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday and the US non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, markets have mostly managed to edge higher. Hopes of a stimulus to the global economy, not just from the ECB but China too, continued to support shares despite worries elsewhere. By the close: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 6.43 points or 0.1% higher at 6659.04 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.27% to 9629.75 \u2022 France's Cac closed up 0.18% at 4434.80 \u2022But Italy's FTSE MIB dipped 1.02% to 21,692.04 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 0.26% lower at 10,435.8 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 12 points or 0.07% higher. On Ukraine, Lagarde said she hoped the geopolitical tensions would ease so Ukraine could recover, and that - as the US tapering talk had an effect before actual tapering happened - she said the talk of sanctions against Russia had also had an effect. And with time being tight, the session is over. Taking questions, Lagarde is asked if there is agreement on what needs to be done. She said there was \"goodwill\", given what she had seen of the finance ministers involved, and she praised Australia's leadership of the G20. But it was not easy to have agreement at G20 and have it agreed when they go back home to their own countries. Back with IMF chief Christine Lagarde, and she concluded her speech: In many ways, the world is at a critical juncture emerging from the greatest financial crisis in almost a hundred years. Recovery is taking hold but is too slow and it faces several obstacles along the road. Bold policy steps can overcome these obstacles and take the global economy to the next level of more rapid and sustainable growth. A quick diversion to the UK, and Sports Direct International has cancelled Friday's meeting to approve a new bonus for founder Mike Ashley. It said the board was disappointed but had not managed to obtain the necessary level of shareholder approval. It now plans to put a new scheme forward at September's annual meeting. Lagarde saw three short term obstacles to growth. Firstly, a prolonged period of low inflation, particularly in the eurozone, suppressing demand and output. More monetary easing, including through unconventional measures, is needed in the euro area to raise the prospects of achieving the ECB's price stability objective. (NB, the ECB meets tomorrow amid growing hints that either negative deposit rates or bond buying could be on the agenda.) She said the Bank of Japan should also persist with its quantative easing policy. In the emerging markets, there is the risk of heightened market volatility due to the tapering of quantitative easing in the US. The final obstacle is rising geopolitical tensions. She said: The situation in the Ukraine is one which, if not well managed, could have broader spillover implications. There are also other cases of geopolitical tension. Resolving them requires not only good policies, but good politics. Lagarde's speech can be seen here. The global economy has stablised since the start of the financial crisis, but the recovery is too weak for comfort, according to IMF managing director Christine Lagarde. Ahead of the IMF's spring meeting next week of its 188 member countries, Lagarde told the School of Advanced International Studies in Washington: Unless countries come together to take the right kind of policy measures, we could be facing years of slow and sub-par growth - well below the solid sustainable growth that is needed to create enough jobs and improve living standards into the future. She said the G20 countries said in February that the right policy action could raise world GDP by more than 2% over the next five years. She said the IMF was well placed to help, but criticised the US for not approving legislation to strengthen the organisation's resources. She said: This is disappointing, but it is not the end of the story. We shall carry on. Back with global growth and she said a fragile recovery was underway but needed to change gears towards more rapid growth. More from the US. New orders for factory goods rose 1.6% in February, the biggest gain in seven months. Analysts had been expecting a figure of 1.2%. The increase again suggests an economy recovering after the recent poor winter weather, while January's figure was revised down to a 1% drop after the previous 0.7% fall. Ahead of the US non-farm payroll figures on Friday, the latest monthly report from payroll processor ADP showed the pace of hiring picking up in March. US private employers added 191,000 workers last month, up from a February figure revised upwards from 139,000 to 178,000. That was slightly below estimates of 195,000 but still showed a rebound after the severe weather earlier in the year hit the economy. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: Today\u2019s report was widely expected to show less intense effects of adverse weather on job creation in March and a similar improvement is also expected to be confirmed by the Bureau of Labour Statistics non-farm payroll data out on Friday. As such, we rule out that an over-200,000 non-farm payroll will have a massive impact on bond prices. The ADP and Bureau of Labour Statistics private payrolls are not always perfectly aligned. That said, today's ADP report clearly points in the direction of further improvement in job creation in March. The services sector seems to be the major contributor to job growth in March, with additional 164,000 jobs over the month. This is the strongest reading since November 2013, with services payrolls reflecting more the business cycle rather than the weather-related swings. Goods producing payrolls were little changed in March, up by 28,000 from 25,000. Most of the latter is explained by a rather solid construction sector that added 20,000 jobs over the month. On the vexed question of UK productivity, this is what the ONS had to say. Productivity continues to lag despite recent moves of workers from industries with low levels of output per hour to those with higher output. The ONS call this the \"reallocation effect\" and estimate that it has added 1.5 percentage points to UK productivity growth between 2008- 2013. But UK output per hour is still 4.3% below its take. In case you missed it, take a look at Katie Allen's recent report on UK productivity and why it matters. More importantly for pay, only with productivity growth can earnings keep growing. The lack of productivity growth in recent years has meant pay growth has stalled and wages have fallen in real terms. Britain's productivity: still a puzzle for policymakers and business leaders. With that, it's over to Nick Fletcher for the rest of the day. The ONS economic review also yields some useful information on living standards. The economy is growing but it hasn't recovered all the ground lost during the recession. GDP grew by 0.7% in the final three months of 2013, but the economy was still 1.4% smaller than it was before the downturn. Even more jarring is GDP per capita. At the end of 2013, GDP per person was 6.1% below where it was at the start of 2008. In other words living standards have barely recovered to where they were a decade ago. Here is some reaction from the general secretary of the TUC, Frances O\u2019Grady: Workers across the economy have experienced a deep squeeze in their pay packets since 2008. Construction workers have been hit the hardest and are currently receiving just 86p for every pound they earned before the crash. What\u2019s even more worrying is that the recent recovery is failing to raise living standards. Disposable incomes are still falling and people are no better off today than they were nine years ago. We need a recovery that benefits ordinary families, rather than one where the proceeds of growth just go to the same old wealthy elites. The reference to construction workers come from ONS statistics showing that real hourly wages in this industry were 13.4% below their pre-downturn level. In contrast, hourly wages for the banking and financial services industry, have fallen by just 4.2% since 2008. The average decline in wages across the economy is 7.6%. Most of the recent increase in employment has come from older workers and the self employed, according to the latest monthly economic review from the Office for National Statistics. Although younger workers are less likely to be self employed and by the beginning of 2012, employment among 25-34 yr olds was picking up. The review, available here, is a great way to get up to speed on the latest developments in the UK economy. Welcoming the SMMT car industry report (previous post), the CBI has said that access to the single market and research funding show how important EU membership is to the UK. While the head of UKIP's policy unit contends that the UK would have no problem striking a trade deal outside the EU. It's all more grist to the mill, ahead of the second TV debate between Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and UKIP's Nigel Farage, to be broadcast on BBC2 at 19.00 GMT tonight. Hello, Jennifer Rankin taking over from Graeme Wearden. Britain's car industry has entered the debate over Britain's membership of the European Union, declaring that it was essential for jobs, investment and growth that we avoid a Brexit. A survey by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders(SMMT) found that 90% of its members believe staying in the EU would be the best for their business. John Leech, head of UK head of automotive at KPMG, the consultancy firm behind the report said: The automotive businesses we spoke to also see the EU as an important bargaining force in global trade negotiations. Moreover, research and development, which is vital to the UK's ability to be at the forefront of innovation in car manufacturing, is both heavily funded by the EU and requires access to the expertise and free movement of skilled engineers within the EU. More here: UK car industry adamant: Britain must stay in EU The report comes the day after Peter Mandelson said the UK would be \"stark-raving bonkers\" to leave the EU Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has argued for today that bankers should have to wait rather longer to receive their bonuses, in a bid to enforce responsible behaviour. Putting bankers' \"skin in the game\" is essential, he argues, so that money can be taken back if problems emerge in future. Speaking to ITV News, Bailey said the current average deferral of three years wasn't long enough. It is important that bankers understand that they are going to be at risk, as that then conditions their behaviour prior [to potential problems]. But he doesn't sound convinced that payments should be held back for as long as a decade -- as suggested by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards last summer. Bailey favours \"something in between\" three years and a whole decade. You've got to balance that against what might be a rather common sense argument about what is the expected length of people's working lives. Frankly, I\u2019m not in the business of deferring for a long time into retirement, and we just need to think about that question. You can watch a clip of the interview here on the ITV News website -- the full interview will be broadcast tonight (6:30pm and 10pm BST). Bailey's boss, governor Mark Carney, has also argued for longer deferral times for discretionary compensation, in a bid to tie these rewards to long-term performance. Simply put, the longer a banker must be patient, the more likely s/he is to avoid reckless deals that would turn sour in the future. And that's a good moment to hand over to Jennifer Rankin. Thanks all. GW Our correspondent in Ireland, Henry McDonald, points out that Ireland's unemployment levels have now fallen for 21 months in a row (see 12.18pm for details) But while today's falling jobless figures indicate that Ireland is slowly recovering there were reminders in court number 19 of Dublin's Central Criminal Court of the days of excessive lending by banks during the Celtic Tiger years. Henry reports : An expert witness for the RBS-owned Ulster Bank admitted in court that the practice of banks seeking out customers to lend them money rather than the other way round was highly unusual. Tom Reid, the former director of risk at the Ulster Bank, was giving evidence at the trial of three executives from the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank. Sean FitzPatrick, Pat Whelan and William McAteer have pleaded not guilty to charges that they unlawfully provided finance to 16 individuals including Sean Quinn - Ireland's one time richest man who became a bankrupt after the financial crash. In court today, Reid was asked about the practice at Anglo where bankers sought out customers to offer loans unlike the other way round in most other financial institutions in Ireland. Asked by prosecuting counsel if this practice was used in the Ulster Bank's dealing with customers, Reid said: \"No, not in my experience.\" As an ex director of risk at the Ulster Bank, Reid told the jury that he \"would have been concerned\" if fellow bankers in the same institution were involved in seeking out customers for loans rather than the normal practice. Reid also told the court that Anglo Irish Bank only had one branch in Dublin while Ulster and the other pillar banks had dozens of branches in the city. Nor did Anglo Irish Bank, to his knowledge at least, have a single ATM machine for dispensing cash. The Ulster Bank executive who worked for the financial institution for 40 years later told the court he would never have approved a \u20ac45 million loan to the so-called Maple 10 - a group of wealthy investors Anglo Irish Bank sought out to persuade to buy shares in their bank in the summer of 2008. Reid said it was not normal for a bank to be offering borrowers a deal in which they would only be 25% liable for loans in order to buy shares in Anglo Irish Bank. He insisted that Ulster Bank's borrowers were meant to be pay back 100 per cent recourse on their loans, and that he - as head of risk - would never had allowed the Maple 10 a deal of 25% recourse. The case continues. Unemployment in Ireland has fallen to its lowest rate in almost five years, before the eurozone debt crisis began. The Irish Live Register (including people claiming jobless benefit, and casual workers) fell by 1,800 to 396,000 in March, on a seasonally adjusted basis. That pulled the country's jobless rate down to 11.8%, from 11.9% in February, the lowest rate since April 2009. On an annual basis, the Irish unemployment total has dropped by 34,000 since March 2013, the Central Statistics Office reported: The number of male claimants decreased by 25,807 (-9.6%) to 243,189 over the year while female claimants decreased by 8,049 (-5.2%) to 148,043. Philip O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist at Investec, said the latest improvement in the Live Register figures \u201cpartly reflects the return to positive net job creation in the economy\u201d (quote via the Irish Times). But it also reflects the fact that many people have been forced to emigrate from the Republic in search of work since Ireland entered the bailout programme which finished at the end of 2013. The Irish jobless rate peaked at over 15% in 2012. Financial analyst @moved_average kindly provided this chart showing that the recovery in Greece's bonds (see here) has not been mirrored, at all, in its labour market: Fears that the eurozone is sliding into deflation have been heightened by a new survey showing that the prices charged by factories across Europe fell in February, and by more than expected. The producer prices index fell by 0.2% month-on-month, mainly due to cheaper energy prices. Economists had expected a 0.1% drop in the measure, which tracks what factories charge for their products. On an annual basis, industrial producer prices tumbled by 1.7% across the eurozone, Eurostat reported. It was primarily caused by a 4.4% drop in the energy sector prices, but also due to a 1.8% drop in intermediate goods prices. Prices of capital goods (heavy machinery etc) rose by 0.4%, non-durable consumer goods rose 0.6%, and by 0.9% for durable consumer goods. Prices in total industry excluding energy fell by 0.5%. Producer prices fell in almost all EU member states: The largest decreases were observed in Cyprus (-5.4%), Lithuania (-4.6%), Belgium (-4.2%), Slovakia (-3.8%) and Greece (-3.5%), and the only increases in Ireland (+1.1%), Latvia (+0.5%) and Malta (+0.3%). A timely reminder, with the ECB holding its monthly meeting tomorrow..... Britain's construction industry has now been growing for almost a year, as World First's Jeremy Cook points out: \u201cA growth next month will see twelve consecutive months of growth for the first time since the global financial crisis. Once again it was the housing market that drove demand onwards; something that is not at all surprising given this morning\u2019s Nationwide house price index showing the average rising by 9.5% year-on-year. \u201cThe one caveat to all of this is the impact of the rate of growth on supply chains; sub-contractors are stretched to breaking point and may provide a break, but not a stop, on further improvements\u2026\u201d Rob Wood of Berenberg bank says the construction boom (see 9.52am onwards) means the UK economy will probably grow faster than expected this year: Having been hit hard by the recession and government cut backs, low interest rates, rising confidence and surging house prices are combining in a sweet spot for the sector. That is yet another reason to think the UK will easily outperform consensus growth expectations this year. David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, says confidence in the UK construction sector is \"soaring\": As the rain gave way to sun, the housing market reclaimed its spot as the star performer. Commercial activity continued to rise strongly, benefitting from the positive business conditions. By contrast, civil engineering activity slowed somewhat, perhaps not that surprising following last month\u2019s stellar figures. But he also echoed Markit's warning that the sector could suffer supply problems if, say, brickmakers can't keep up with demand. Encouragingly, employment among construction companies continued to rise in March: Markit reports: Increased work on new projects contributed to a sharp rise in employment numbers across the construction sector. The rate of job creation picked up over the month and was the second-fastest since August 2007. A reminder of the old adage that firms take on more staff when they have more demand, not when they have higher profits. Confidence among UK construction firms has hit the highest level in over seven years, as housebuilders continue to drive strong growth in the sector. Markit's monthly construction PMI survey, just released, showed that confidence about the 12-month outlook hits highest level since January 2007. Although new business volumes hit a six-month low, optimism is being driven by \"improving underlying demand and more favourable business conditions\". Almost 60% of builders surveyed expect to enjoy higher activity than a year ago, and only 5% expect a fall. Continuing the theme of the morning, housebuilders reclaimed their place as the fastest-growing part of the construction sector. Commercial construction activity also rose sharply, close to its fastest rate since the summer of 2007. Civil engineering, though, saw a drop in growth - as emergency work prompted by the winter flooding dried up. The overall construction PMI for March came in at 62.5, denoting strong growth (any reading over 50 shows that activity increased). That's slightly lower than February's 62.6. But as firms keep winning more work, there are growing concerns that raw materials could run short. Tim Moore, Senior Economist at Markit, explains: \u201cHouse building reclaimed its place as the main driving force behind the resurgent UK construction sector in March, following some weather-related disruptions during the previous month. \u201cThe rise in residential construction was one of the sharpest experienced over the past ten years, helped by strong demand for new development projects and supportive funding conditions. \u201cImproving economic fundamentals led to a faster rise in commercial activity during March, while civil engineering growth eased sharply from the survey- record high seen amid the flood relief efforts in February. \u201cExpectations for construction growth over the year ahead have now reached their highest since the start of 2007, and a strong pipeline of new work is fuelling job creation across the sector. \u201cHowever, the latest survey does little to dispel concerns that supplier capacity will become a fly in the ointment. Lead-times for the delivery of construction materials lengthened in March by one of the greatest amounts since the survey began in April 1997, while sub-contractor availability fell at the fastest rate for thirteen-and-a-half years.\u201d In the bond markets, Greece's borrowing costs have fallen to their lowest level since the eurozone debt crisis began. The yield, or interest rate, on its 10-year bonds has fallen to just 6.4% -- further away from the dangerous levels that forced it to take a bailout. That's the lowest level since 2010, according to Tradeweb. This latest sign of confidence in Greece's ability to repay its debts comes a day after eurozone finance ministers agreed to advance the next slice of its bailout. Athens is now planning to issue some longer bonds later this year - the first stage in returning to the financial markets (unless a third bailout should be needed) In the stock markets, shares have hit their highest level since the early days of the financial crisis. Most European stock markets have risen in early trading, adding to yesterday's rally on Wall Street - where the S&amp;P 500 hit a record closing high. The FT's Jamie Chisholm has the details: The FTSE Eurofirst 300 is up 0.2 per cent after its Asia-Pacific peer added 0.4 per cent. Together, they are helping the FTSE All-World equity index rise 0.2 per cent to 272.6, a seventh consecutive day of gains that takes the worldwide benchmark to its highest since December 2007. Another 2.6 per cent rise and the All-World will be in record territory. It's a pretty calm situation in Europe, though: FTSE 100: up 5 points at 6658, + 0.1% Germany DAX: up 18 points at 9621, +0.2% French CAC: down 1 points at 4425, -0.03% London's housing market is running hottest in two of its less trendy areas -- Brent (up 31% annually) and Lambeth (+30%). (click on the image below for the full breakdown). Here's Hilary Osborne's news story on today's Nationwide survey: House prices in London have increased by almost a fifth over the past 12 months, and are now 20% above their pre-crisis peak, according to the latest data from the country's biggest building society. In news that will fuel concerns of a price bubble in the capital,Nationwide building society said the average price of a London home had increased by 18% over the year and by 5.3% in the past three months alone, and at \u00a3362,699 was now more than twice the figure for the rest of the UK. More here: London house prices rise 18% in year fuelling fears of bubble Over in the eurozone, Spain's unemployment total fell by 16,000 in March. That's the second monthly fall in a row, after dropping by 1,900 in February. Here's Reuters' early take: The number of people registered as jobless in Spain fell by 0.35 percent in March from a month earlier, or by 16,620 people, leaving 4.8 million people out of work, data from the Labour Ministry showed on Wednesday. The figure marks the second straight month of declines and is the sharpest monthly fall for March since 2006, the Ministry said. Housing expert Henry Pryor is worried that some housing developers may actually be paying deposits to their new properties sold: He doesn't reckon the Help To Buy subsidy scheme is a threat to stability right now: Alex Gosling, managing director at online estate agents Housesimple.co.uk, says today's figures must be depressing reading for anyone trying to get onto the housing ladder. Nationwide say house price growth shows \"tentative signs of moderation\" - tell that to the thousands of Londoners priced out of the market. \u201cThe influx of wealthy overseas buyers continues to drive up house prices. And whereas they helped prop up the market after the financial crash, they're now a hindrance to hard working Londoners on average salaries. \"In the capital, if you can't make a healthy withdrawal from the Bank of Mum and Dad, then average salaries simply don't cut the mustard. The situation is so acute in London that many properties are being snapped up within days, with hordes of potential buyers racing to squeeze in a viewing (see Amelia Gentleman's piece on Hackney: Journey to the heart of the house price bubble) And with real wages lagging, Gosling is seeing signs that some house buyers are taking serious risks: \"London homeowners can pretty much name their price at the moment. The asking price being marketed is more often than not no reflection of the price a property is sold for. We are seeing a significant number of properties going for above asking price, and in some cases tens of thousands of pounds above.The worry is that buyers, in their desperation to secure a property, are over-stretching themselves.\" Rising house prices put more pressure on the Bank of England to act before economic stability is threatened. IHS Global Insight's Howard Archer, who reckons the average price will rise by at least 8% this year, says policymakers need to keep \"a very close watch\" on the market: Once strong upward momentum has developed in the housing market, it can be hard to stop \u2013 especially if interest rates are unlikely to rise markedly. In the budget, the Chancellor asked the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee to be particularly vigilant against the emergence of potential risks in the housing market. One option, he says, would be to dilute the government's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme: While the Bank of England currently does not currently see excessive house price rises outside London, [governor] Mark Carney has expressed concern about the UK\u2019s past record of house booms and busts, and we believe the bank will take further action later this year to try and dampen the housing market having already ended Funding for Lending Support for mortgage lending. This could very well include the Bank of England recommending to the government that it dilutes the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme. In particular, the \u00a3600,000 price limit for a house under the scheme could be cut, perhaps to \u00a3300,000. Readers in Sunderland have not benefitted from the housing recovery -- prices there have risen just 1% annually, less than inflation or average wage increases. The North-South divide is alive and well too. House price growth in Northern England has slowed over the last year, but accelerated 'down South: Today's data in a nutshell: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and business. We start with fresh proof that London house prices are roaring ahead, with the gap between housing in the capital and the rest of Britain hitting a record level. Nationwide's latest report shows that London house prices have surged by 18% over the last year, double the national average of 9.2%. That's the strongest annual price rise in a decade. With South East England also posted annual double-digit gains in the January-March quarter, it's the latest signal that the economic recovery is being felt mainly in and around the city -- deepening Britain's economic divide. In Wales, for example, prices are up just 5%. While the typical UK property now costs \u00a3180,264, the average London house price is now \u00a3362,699 Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: \"The gap between house prices in London and the rest of the UK is the widest it's ever been, both in cash and percentage terms. \"Overall, the southern regions have been outperforming for some time, with the result that house prices in London, the Outer Metropolitan and Outer South East have now surpassed their pre-crisis peaks. \" Cheap credit, low interest rates, and the recent upturn in the economy appear to be working like an exhilarating cocktail on the housing market, in some parts of the UK anyway: Gardner added that while London house prices are a fifth higher than their pre-crisis peak in 2007, while other areas are still lagging: Although all regions saw annual house price growth in Q1, ten of the thirteen regions have yet to surpass their pre-crisis peaks. London, the Outer Metropolitan and the Outer South East are the exception. There are also signs, though, that the surge in house prices could be slowing. Prices rose by just 0.4% during March, the slowest monthly expansion since last June. Reaction,and a few interesting graphs, to follow....along with other breaking news through the day....",

The announcement came as City analysts predicted that British Gas would have to follow rival supplier SSE, another of the big six, and impose a price freeze until 2016. The forecasters at investment bank Credit Suisse predicted holding prices would temporarily drag down profit margins at British Gas from 6% to less than 4% in 2015 but then they would bounce back to 6.4% in 2017. The bank also predicted that Centrica would come out unscathed from an official energy market investigation that regulators announced last week. Chris Weston, the boss of the group's British Gas arm, has been given \u00a31.2m of shares under the same long-term incentive scheme (LTIS), according to a filing on Wednesday by the energy supplier. Laidlaw received just under 600,000 new shares at a price of 327.82p each which would give him \u00a31.9m in three years' time when the scheme vests, provided he meets all the conditions imposed on him. The Centrica boss was due more than \u00a32m last year, without getting any payments under an earlier LTIS scheme, and the company said he was donating a bonus element worth \u00a3851,000 of that to charity. A Centrica spokesman pointed out the latest award was of \"no value at the moment\" and would only be worth anything if Laidlaw could meet tightly drawn-up performance targets. The group declined to be drawn on the price freeze prediction from Credit Suisse. \"What we have said is that we will keep prices as low as possible for the customer. Every supplier has got different pricing strategies,\" said the spokesman. Mark Freshney and Guy Mackenzie of Credit Suisse said in a note to investors that it was now highly unlikely British Gas would raise prices in 2015. \"While Centrica has not made a similar pledge (to freeze prices like SSE) and has stated that it wants to retain flexibility given the turmoil in the Ukraine, we think Centrica will have to follow suit.\" The investment bank said the British Gas profit margin of 6% would fall to 5.8% in the current financial year and then to 3.9% in 2015, before starting to climb again. The big six energy firms have previously warned the lights could go out as investment in new power plants falls following Ed Miliband's pledge that an incoming Labour government would demand a price freeze for 20 months to \"reset\" the market. But SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, last week said it would freeze its prices until at least 2016 \u2013 the longest unconditional price guarantee the domestic energy market has seen. The move came ahead of a decision by three regulators, Ofgem, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), to move for a full investigation into the working of the power markets. Centrica warned this could lead to uncertainty and a freeze on investment in new power plants at a critical time.

Karbasnikoff said retail spending in Moscow alone was equal to half of Spain's, but noted that the Russian economy was slowing and that the rouble's sudden depreciation had put pressure on consumers' pockets, as most goods are imported. Another Cushman partner, Michael Rodda, said about the upturn in European mall-building: \"Between 2008 and 2011 it was very difficult to develop shopping centres. Development finance is available again and most of the occupier markets are healthy again. We are now back into an environment where developers feel confident about breaking ground.\" In central and eastern Europe developers were taking a \"cookie cutter\" approach with \"off-the-shelf\" malls being built for a captive audience, Rodda said, while grander schemes were the norm in western Europe. Last October, the upmarket Beaugrenelle shopping mall reopened after 10 years of work in Paris, not far from the Eiffel Tower \u2013 a rare occasion for the French capital, which is traditionally resistant to mass commerce. Designed as a chic department store, it boasts six floors, an atrium and footbridges. Of the 110 new malls in the second half of last year, 37 were in western Europe and 73 in central and eastern Europe. Western Europe saw the most extensions of existing malls with 45, compared to 19 in central and eastern Europe. Turning to the UK, Rodda said shop rents were starting to go up in \"pockets\". \"Very few retailers are going into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The bottoming out of the market has occurred. Sentiment is much more positive about new leases and new space.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Asos, the internet retailer targeting fashion-conscious twentysomethings, is to take a break from venturing into new countries until at least the autumn after admitting that its entry into China has been tougher than expected. The company on Wednesday reported a 22% dive in pre-tax profits to \u00a320m for the six months to the end of February despite increasing sales by more than a third, as the cost of expansion weighed on its business. The fall in profits was widely expected after the retailer warned in March that higher warehouse costs and start-up losses in China would hit its bottom line, slashing more than \u00a3400m off its stock market value as shares fell. Nick Robertson, chief executive, said Asos had struggled with complex restrictions on the clothing trade in China which meant in some cases it was easier to send garments made locally to and from the UK rather than transport them down the road. Other items had to be re-labelled by hand to meet Chinese requirements on washing instructions. Such difficulties meant that introducing new brands to China to complement Asos's own-label ranges has been slow. Asked if the experience had been tougher than expected, Robertson said: \"Yes, we have had to learn a lot.\" He added: \"We are going to have a pause on new websites for the next six to 12 months.\" But he said the company would then look at a second wave of international development, likely to start with Japan and Korea followed by Brazil and India. With that in mind, the company announced a sales target of \u00a32.5bn \"as the next staging post of our journey\". It is spending \u00a368m this year to help meet this target, including further investment in its China start-up, expansion of its main UK warehouse in Barnsley, and new facilities in Berlin and Shanghai, and expansion of a warehouse in Ohio. \"This increased pace of investment has reduced our profitability in the period, but will deliver significantly increased capacity as well as efficiencies in the longer term,\" said Robertson. \"Asos is not and has never been about the short-term; the scale of the global opportunity remains as exciting as ever and we are investing for the many opportunities ahead.\" But he made clear that there was still plenty of opportunity for growth in the UK, where sales rose 32% in the period. \"We're still spanking it,\" he said. Here, the company is trying out a range of new ideas to drive sales including collection lockers. Robertson said Asos was currently testing these on staff at its head office and might look at operating them with partners in locations such as tube stations and car parks. Overseas, Asos is hoping to gain from being able to adapt its prices to different markets from May. That will help it compete with local players when there are swings in currency exchange rates and to export more brands which charge premium prices in certain countries. Some analysts think Asos has overegged its long-term prospects for growth, but the company said customer engagement remained high, with average customer spend increasing by 4%.",

Other items had to be re-labelled by hand to meet Chinese requirements on washing instructions.</p> <p>Such difficulties meant that introducing new brands to China to complement Asos's own-label ranges has been slow.</p> <p>Asked if the experience had been tougher than expected, Robertson said: \"Yes, we have had to learn a lot.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We are going to have a pause on new websites for the next six to 12 months.\" But he said the company would then look at a second wave of international development, likely to start with Japan and Korea followed by Brazil and India.</p> <p>With that in mind, the company announced a sales target of \u00a32.5bn \"as the next staging post of our journey\". It is spending \u00a368m this year to help meet this target, including further investment in its China start-up, expansion of its main UK warehouse in Barnsley, and new facilities in Berlin and Shanghai, and expansion of a warehouse in Ohio.</p> <p>\"This increased pace of investment has reduced our profitability in the period, but will deliver significantly increased capacity as well as efficiencies in the longer term,\" said Robertson. \"Asos is not and has never been about the short-term; the scale of the global opportunity remains as exciting as ever and we are investing for the many opportunities ahead.\"</p> <p>But he made clear that there was still plenty of opportunity for growth in the UK, where sales rose 32% in the period. \"We're still spanking it,\" he said. Here, the company is trying out a range of new ideas to drive sales including collection lockers.</p> <p>Robertson said Asos was currently testing these on staff at its head office and might look at operating them with partners in locations such as tube stations and car parks.</p> <p>Overseas, Asos is hoping to gain from being able to adapt its prices to different markets from May. That will help it compete with local players when there are swings in currency exchange rates and to export more brands which charge premium prices in certain countries.</p> <p>Some analysts think Asos has overegged its long-term prospects for growth, but the company said customer engagement remained high, with average customer spend increasing by 4%.</p>",
