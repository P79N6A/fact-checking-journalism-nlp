It might take an economist to notice that all three can be seen as markets \u2013 but ones where no money changes hands. Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley have won the Nobel prize for their work on how these difficult choices can be made without using prices as a mechanism. Shapley first dared in 1962 to tackle the question asked by women's magazines through the years \u2013 how to find a suitable match. The specific question he sought to answer was: how could individuals in a group be paired up when they all had different views on who would be their best match?

What we want to do, the new boss said, is \"deliver great journalism every day and to see circulation and advertising increasing\". What is happening, Fox conceded, is that there \"are continued circulation declines and even faster reductions in advertising revenues\". Presumably, the boss still believes in the journalism, though. In some respects, Fox can clearly see what had gone wrong during the long tenure of Sly Bailey. Fox talked not very subtly about the \"scattergun approach to digital\". Trinity Mirror has been through many digital acquisitions and launches, from Hotgroup, in online recruitment, to 3am, where its journalists stay up late so you don't have to. Yet digital revenues were only 5.8% of group revenues in the half year, growing by only 8.9% to \u00a320.8m.

Jezri Mohideen was suspended last week, according to Bloomberg news agency, as head of rates trading for Europe and Asia Pacific. He had previously been based in Tokyo, where he was head of yen products, and Bloomberg reported he had allegedly instructed colleagues to lower Libor rates while in this position. RBS has fired four traders for attempting to manipulate Libor and other interest rates. They include Tan Chi Min, a senior trader in Singapore who is now suing the bank for wrongful dismissal. The case involving Tan has given rise to embarrassing allegations with the release of instant messages in which an RBS trader quips \"hahahah\" and describes Libor as a \"cartel\". The bank would not comment on Mohideen, whose suspension comes as the bank awaits a fine from a number of regulatory bodies, including the Financial Services Authority, for its role in the Libor scandal, which has already led to the departure of Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond. RBS, 81% owned by the taxpayer, has also taken disciplinary action against a number of individuals involved in attempting to rig Libor while others have left of their own accord. A bank spokesman said: \"Our investigations into submissions, communications and procedures relating to the setting of Libor and other interest rates are ongoing. RBS and its employees continue to cooperate fully with regulators\". Bloomberg had spoken to Mohideen last month, when he told the news agency he had not pressurised colleagues into lowering the submissions to the Libor panel. The latest allegations in the Libor affair came as RBS shares fell 1% to 268p amid warnings from analysts that the bank would need to cut the price of the 316 branches it was going to sell to Santander for \u00a31.6bn. The sale, forced on RBS by Brussels as a result of the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout, fell through on Friday after more than two years of negotiations and after \u00a34.5bn was pumped into Santander UK business by its Spanish parent. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: \"Assuming that an alternative sale is agreed, we now anticipate that RBS may ultimately settle for terms \u00a30.5bn to \u00a31.0bn worse than those agreed with Santander in August 2010.\" The bank said it will \"commence a new process of disposal\" and its chief executive, Stephen Hester, is understood to have received at least three phone calls from potentially interested parties over the weekend.

Caroline Gulliver at Espirito Santo said the retailer had fixed its basic problems and was now able to focus on improving its service to customers, including its online system for Screwfix.

Kingfisher is well positioned with competitive prices, a suite of own brands, including the new Titan and Site brands, and superior availability and service (at least, that is what they are aiming for). Ultimately though, B&amp;Q intends to reduce the size of its stores on a 5-10 year basis as opportunities arise during the renewal of its existing leases. <br> Our final key takeaway from the trip was that Kingfisher, as market leader, has gone about creating a consortium of global market leaders so that they can be ready for the implementation of the government's various \"Eco\" programs. We think the government is being highly ambitious in expecting 14m households (around 30% of the UK) to have made their homes energy efficient by 2020. Nevertheless, Kingfisher has only invested \u00a320m in this project and the idea of offering a complete package, with its own iQe range of products, is currently unrivalled in the market. </blockquote> <p>Philip Dorgan at Panmure Gordon also issued a buy note:</p> <blockquote> Kingfisher's investor day provided interesting insights into the growth outlook at B&amp;Q and Screwfix. The former is relatively mature and will benefit from group scale in common ranging and direct sourcing, while the latter still has significant organic growth opportunity and is leading the group's multichannel strategy. While there are some headwinds to overcome, we believe that Kingfisher's long term growth prospects mean that the current valuation of 11.8 times trough earnings is a good entry point. </blockquote> <p>On Screwfix, Dorgan said:</p> <blockquote> Screwfix currently has 240 stores in the UK and believes that it has scope for 420. It targets the small tradesman, where convenience is the prime shopping driver. We found Screwfix's multichannel offer to be particularly appealing \u2013 indeed it is being used as the platform for the group's multichannel strategy \u2013 as it offers multiple buying and fulfilment options. <br> Indeed, a trader can order online and collect in three minutes, which means that his cup of tea doesn't go cold as he waits in the car park..

A report by the business consultancy Bain &amp; Company and the Italian luxury goods trade body Altagamma says Chinese big spenders, the luxury industry's main engine of growth, are showing signs of slowing down. It pointed to the change in government in China and a crackdown on corruption. Global luxury goods sales are expected to grow by just 5% this year to reach \u20ac212bn (\u00a3170bn), compared with 13% last year, at constant exchange rates. The European market is expected to grow by 5%, half last year's rate, with crisis-hit Italy and Spain seeing the biggest declines. Burberry has said the super-rich are spending more than ever, while \"aspirational\" middle-class shoppers are being squeezed. Chinese luxury goods sales are set to rise by 8% at constant currencies and 20% at current currencies to reach \u20ac15bn, while last year they climbed 30% on both measures, according to the Bain report. Even so, China has overtaken Japan as the world's largest market, behind the US, and accounts for one in four purchases of luxury goods. Chinese shoppers now make up half of the luxury purchases in all of Asia, and nearly a third of those in Europe. Claudia D'Arpizio, a Bain partner in Milan and lead author of the study, said: \"We are seeing sharp disparities between brands that are not keeping up with the quickening pace of change in the market and those that are adjusting to shifts in tastes and demographics.\" The study found that accessories had become all-important. For the first time, leather goods and shoes have become the largest slice of the market, at 27% of sales. Men are spending more. Younger people are more focused on uniqueness than heritage, 24/7 access rather than exclusivity, and prize entertainment over mere shopping. Leather goods sales are expected to post the fastest growth, of 16%, to \u20ac33bn this year, while watches will be just behind with 14% growth to \u20ac35bn. Shoes and jewellery are seen growing by 13%, to \u20ac12bn and \u20ac11bn respectively.",
