      "bodyText": "The Burnham building in Boston, Massachusetts, is widely regarded as one of the finest pieces of architecture in the city. It was designed for the Filene\u2019s department store chain in 1912 by Daniel Burnham, the Chicago architect behind the Selfridges building on London\u2019s Oxford Street, and is on America\u2019s national register of historic places. But its recent past has been traumatic. In 2007 it fell empty when the branch of Filene\u2019s that it had housed since before the first world war closed. A property developer then gutted the interior, sparking fury in the Boston area. Now though, the Burnham building has found an unlikely saviour. This week, Primark, the discount clothing retailer, will open its first US store on the site of the former chain\u2019s flagship. This is the latest stage of Primark\u2019s dramatic evolution over 46 years from a single store \u2013 Penneys on Mary Street in Dublin \u2013 to a fashion chain with almost 300 stores across Britain and Europe. Primark has won fans in France, Spain and Germany, but the US will be its biggest challenge yet. An array of major British retailers, including Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Dixons, have all suffered embarrassing failures there. But securing the Burnham building does at least mean Primark has a prominent location from which to start. \u201cBostonians knew Filene\u2019s and a number will have shopped there,\u201d said John Bason, finance director of Primark\u2019s parent company, Associated British Foods (ABF). \u201cI think they will be genuinely interested in what happened to it.\u201d The Boston Primark, opening on 10 September, will be followed by a second US store at the King of Prussia shopping mall near Philadelphia before Christmas. Six more shops will open in 2016, including one in New York. The retailer has chosen to focus on the north-eastern US and always wanted its first store to be in Boston. \u201cWe chose Boston because it is European-looking: it looks across the Atlantic. The Irish connection for this Dublin-based retailer was also a useful emotional connection,\u201d said Bason. \u201cIn the first year there will be a lot of learning to do. I think we have a good idea about what fashion and styles will work, but there are some things we can\u2019t learn until we have opened.\u201d He added that Primark has been preparing to launch in the US \u201cfor a number of years\u201d. ABF announced the Boston opening in April 2014, and Primark has been conducting extensive research since then. It will stock the US stores with clothing from its European suppliers, who will deliver to a new warehouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The stores will be replenished with new stock every day and largely sell a collection of Primark\u2019s existing designs which the retailer believes will most appeal to American shoppers, although small number of products have been specifically designed for the US. \u201cWe are not saying we are bringing European fashion to the US,\u201d Bason said of Primark\u2019s approach. \u201cWe are saying Primark is a fast-follower in fashion.\u201d He admitted that Primark management regards the US launch with a mixture of \u201cexcitement and anxiety\u201d. \u201cThere will be some things that are right and some things that are wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be a sluggish start. The awareness of Primark [in the US] is well, well below what it is in Europe.\u201d However, even if Bason chooses to downplay expectations, he believes Primark and its low-price fashion can exploit a gap in the American market. \u201cWe are going into the US because we believe we have something that is differentiated from what else is there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going in saying, \u2018You lucky Bostonians \u2013 look what we have got for you\u2019.\u201d Overconfidence and hubris have in the past hampered British retailers\u2019 attempts to move into the US. Tesco, for example, thought it could launch an entirely new brand and concept \u2013 its Fresh &amp; Easy foodstore chain\u2013 on US shoppers. However, retail consultant Richard Hyman said he thought Primark could buck the trend. \u201cThe US has been a graveyard for the vast majority of UK retailers who have gone there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe apparel market there is massively overcrowded and, on the face of it, another player is the last thing they need. \u201cHowever, US clothing is some way behind ours in sophistication, newness and style. This is particularly true at the value end, which tends to be very samey, poor quality and lacking in fashionability. I think Primark will be extremely successful there.\u201d Nonetheless, Neil Saunders, the US-based chief executive of retail consultancy Conlumino, warned that Primark would have little margin for error in the face of fierce competition. \u201cThere is no real gap here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market is crowded and competitive and oversupplied with apparel retailers. This is one of the reasons why so many firms \u2013 like Sears, American Apparel and Gap \u2013 are suffering. Primark is going to have to work hard to stand out.\u201d The stores would, he said, have to adapt to US shopping habits: \u201cAlthough Primark is competitive on price it operates an EDLP [everyday low price] model. That\u2019s quite different from a lot of US clothing retailers in Primark\u2019s space, who use extensive discounting, promotions and coupons on top of this to drive footfall and sales. \u201cThe US consumer likes this, and responds well to the idea of getting something at less than the price it is supposed to be sold at. The risk is that being simply the lowest on price may be a bit blunt. Primark definitely needs to make more noise in the US.\u201d But despite this warning, the opening of the Boston store will be low-key. The retailer is holding be an evening event on Wednesday night for the American fashion press and bloggers to see its clothing, before the mayor of Boston, Marty Walsh, officially opens the store on Thursday. And even if Primark does become the latest retailer to fail in its attempt to cross the Atlantic, at least it will have won friends in Boston by breathing new life into the Burnham building. BAD BRITISH BETS Tesco Britain\u2019s biggest retailer launched Fresh &amp; Easy in California in 2007 but pulled out six years later, having never made a profit. US shoppers were uncomfortable with Fresh &amp; Easy\u2019s self-service tills and packaged fruit and vegetables, stores were opened in off-beat locations and consumer spending was held back by the financial crisis. Marks &amp; Spencer M&amp;S spent $750m (\u00a3494m) buying men\u2019s clothing retailer Brooks Brothers in 1988, but ended up selling it on at a loss. M&amp;S also bought US supermarket chain Kings, but that was also sold in 2002. Dixons The electrical chain bought Philadelphia-based Silo in 1987.

      "bodyText": "There was something for everyone in August\u2019s US jobs report. The headline figure for jobs growth was less than expected, but the last two months were revised up. Wages grew, but the number of people out of the workforce remains worryingly high. What\u2019s a central banker to do? Sadly the answer is exactly what they want to do, and no one \u2013 not even Donald Trump \u2013 seems to think that\u2019s an issue. At their annual retreat in Jackson Hole last month, several top officials of the Federal Reserve board reiterated their desire to raise interest rates, even if the recent market turmoil may have put these plans on hold for the moment. The basic point remains the same: these officials argue the labor market is approaching full employment and they need to hike interest rates to slow the rate of job growth. If the economy keeps creating jobs at a rate near 200,000 a month, they say, we will soon have problems with inflation. This case seems so far removed from reality that it borders on absurdity. While the unemployment rate is relatively low at 5.1%, the percentage of the population that is working is still down more than three percentage points from its pre-recession level. This implies that we are still 3-4m jobs below the trend path. Contrary to those who blame this drop on ageing baby boomers, even the employment rate of prime-age workers (ages 25-54) is down by nearly the same percentage. There are two explanations for this sort of fall-off. One is that millions of thirtysomethings decided to retire early. The other is that the labor market is still very weak, leading millions of people to give up looking for jobs \u2013 they are then no longer counted as being unemployed. The Fed is apparently not choosing the commonsense explanation. The inflation theory doesn\u2019t make the case for a Fed rate hike look any better. The Fed is officially committed to maintaining an average inflation rate of 2%. The rate it targets has averaged less than 1.5% over the past seven years. This means that inflation could average almost 3% for the next four years and still leave the Fed on target. By contrast, inflation was just 1.3% over the past year. The Fed\u2019s plan to slow the economy will not only affect jobs, it will also reduce the ability of workers to secure wage gains. The tightness of the labor market has a huge impact on the bargaining power of workers at the middle and bottom end of the wage distribution. When we get tight labor markets, factory workers, retail clerks and fast-food workers have some choice of jobs. They can tell employers that if they don\u2019t get pay increases, they will get another job. The only time most workers saw substantial wage gains in the past four decades was during the low unemployment years of the late 1990s. If the Fed raises rates, it will be acting to ensure that workers don\u2019t get to enjoy this bargaining power, meaning that most workers will not share in the gains of economic growth. The really striking part of this story is that the Fed is crafting its plans for slowing job creation and damping down wage growth in the middle of a presidential campaign. There are almost two dozen candidates chasing after votes, most of them promising economic plans that will create jobs and boost wages. Yet not one of these candidates has said anything about the Federal Reserve. This is like making plans to remodel an apartment building without taking note of the wrecking ball that is hanging in front of it. If the Fed slams on the brakes with higher interest rates, even the most brilliant plans for infrastructure improvement or tax incentives won\u2019t be effective in creating jobs. As we have seen over the past seven years, the Fed can\u2019t always boost the economy as much as it might like with lower interest rates, but it certainly can slow the economy by raising interest rates high enough. If the presidential candidates are actually serious about creating jobs and strengthening the labor market, they should be talking about the Fed. While no one would expect the president to micromanage the board, it is certainly reasonable for the candidates to be talking about the sort of people they would appoint to the Fed in the same way that they would talk about the sort of people they would appoint to the supreme court. The problem is that the Fed is a regulatory agency that has gone badly off the rails. It would be as though the Food and Drug Administration were refusing to approve cancer drugs that our best scientists recognized as safe and effective, even as tens of thousands of people died of cancer. If the presidential candidates are serious about strengthening the economy, they better start talking about getting the Fed back on track.",

      "bodyText": "This Labor Day customers are likely to pay the lowest gas prices since 2004, according to the American Automobile Association. On Friday, the national average price of gas was $2.42 per gallon \u2013 a dollar less per gallon than a year ago. US consumers should save more than $1bn on gas this weekend compared to 2014, according to AAA, which estimates drivers could save between $15 to $25 on every trip to the gas station. \u201cIt is unbelievable that drivers are ending their summer vacations with the lowest gas prices for this time of year in more than a decade,\u201d said AAA spokesman Avery Ash. In August, the average gas price was about $2.60 a gallon, the lowest average for the month since 2005 and 15 cents less per gallon than the July average. If gas prices drop after Labor day, which is usually the trend, AAA expects they could fall below $2 per gallon by Christmas. \u201cGas prices in many parts of the country could fall below $2 per gallon by Christmas if the cost of crude oil remains low,\u201d said Ash. \u201cThere is a good reason to believe that cheaper oil costs, a seasonal decline in driving and the switchover to less costly winter-blend gasoline will continue to push down prices through the end of the year.\u201d AAA found that currently more than 5% of US stations are selling gas for less than $2 a gallon. On Friday, average gas prices in South Carolina dropped below $2 a gallon and average prices in Alabama and Mississippi are expected to follow in the next week. The last time prices dropped below $2 a gallon was in February in Idaho and Utah. Cheap gas does not come without a cost. At the end of July, Shell announced that it was going to cut 6,500 jobs by the end of 2015 to deal with the slump in prices. And Continental Resources, an Oklahoma oil company that tracks layoffs, found the US had cut at least 91,000 jobs in the energy industry since last summer. The US Department, however, said the upside is that the low gas prices are basically a tax cut for Americans who drive. \u201cWe are always concerned when people lose jobs in this country, but I think the flip side of that is that the US is producing more oil and gas than it ever has. It\u2019s exporting more than it ever has,\u201d Chris Lu, US deputy labor secretary, told the Guardian. \u201cBecause of that another global trend \u2013 the price of gas has dropped and it essentially translates into a tax cut for Americans who are driving cars.\u201d According to the United Steelworkers union, not all oil workers have been affected. For example, a limited number of oil refinery workers have felt the effects of job cuts in their field. \u201cThe US oil refineries are doing a booming business because of the low cost of crude oil feedstock,\u201d said Lynne Hancock, spokeswoman for the United Steelworkers union, which represents oil refinery workers and a few oil exploration and production workers. \u201cThey are operating at a high utilization rate and are earning profits selling refined oil products. The refining sector is boosting the oil companies\u2019 profits. The US chemical sector also has benefited from low natural gas prices from fracking.\u201d Hancock added that while many oil exploration and production workers have been laid off, engineers are in high demand at refineries and chemical plants. \u201cThose with lesser skills might have job opportunities in the retooling of refineries to handle the light, sweet crude from fracking and the expansion of capacity at these refineries,\u201d she said.",

He pointed out that researchers have been looking for a replacement for the last 60 years \u2013 and not for purely moral or commercial reasons, but for scientific ones: since each batch of serum is unique, its inclusion in cell cultures introduces variables that could skew results. And yet fetal bovine serum remains the standard. Blood from adult cows could be a replacement if you were able to deactivate its antibodies (otherwise they could attack the tissue cells being grown) or horse serum might work, but both still necessitate animal slaughter. Mark Post, a professor at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, is currently experimenting with growing in vitro meat in non-animal-derived serums, but he admits that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/1362/5848/6m/s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/high-tech-food/\">he doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s in them</a>. (They are apparently the trade secrets of their third-party developers.)<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Not everyone is as skeptical as Catts, though. \u201cThe naysayers are always picking at things when progress requires big-picture thinking and the knowledge that progress in small areas will inevitably come about,\u201d says Ingrid Newkirk, president and co-founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta). Although the animal rights organization has a reputation for being radical, their perspective on Modern Meadow\u2019s use of fetal bovine serum is surprisingly generous. </p> <p>\u201cI frankly don\u2019t care what method they\u2019re using as long as they make progress, and they still seem to be doing that,\u201d says Newkirk of Modern Meadow\u2019s efforts. This enthusiasm is girded with the belief that the use of fetal bovine serum will soon be phased out by plant, fungal or synthetic counterparts, all of which have demonstrated success in lab tests. In the meantime, Newkirk points out, in vitro meat production remains less cruel than slaughterhouses.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re fully behind these efforts, and we have faith in their worth,\u201d says Newkirk of all in vitro meat, \u201cas they will allow people who won\u2019t change their eating habits \u2013 no matter what they hear about cruelty to animals, hardening of the arteries, filth in processing, water pollution or spewing of methane \u2013 to continue to eat real flesh.\u201d<br></p> <p>And that is the linchpin to the entire debate around fetal bovine serum: the general population\u2019s refusal to accept the consequences of traditional meat production. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe current models of meat and leather production are problematic, but there are simple ways to solve it, and that\u2019s to just stop using them,\u201d said Catts. \u201cOne of the decisions I made for myself after doing this research, after eating [in vitro] meat, is that I\u2019ve basically stopped eating meat. That\u2019s such an easy way of solving it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a good business model.\u201d<br></p> <p></p>",

Mark Post, a professor at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, is currently experimenting with growing in vitro meat in non-animal-derived serums, but he admits that he doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s in them. (They are apparently the trade secrets of their third-party developers.) Not everyone is as skeptical as Catts, though. \u201cThe naysayers are always picking at things when progress requires big-picture thinking and the knowledge that progress in small areas will inevitably come about,\u201d says Ingrid Newkirk, president and co-founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta). Although the animal rights organization has a reputation for being radical, their perspective on Modern Meadow\u2019s use of fetal bovine serum is surprisingly generous. \u201cI frankly don\u2019t care what method they\u2019re using as long as they make progress, and they still seem to be doing that,\u201d says Newkirk of Modern Meadow\u2019s efforts. This enthusiasm is girded with the belief that the use of fetal bovine serum will soon be phased out by plant, fungal or synthetic counterparts, all of which have demonstrated success in lab tests. In the meantime, Newkirk points out, in vitro meat production remains less cruel than slaughterhouses. \u201cWe\u2019re fully behind these efforts, and we have faith in their worth,\u201d says Newkirk of all in vitro meat, \u201cas they will allow people who won\u2019t change their eating habits \u2013 no matter what they hear about cruelty to animals, hardening of the arteries, filth in processing, water pollution or spewing of methane \u2013 to continue to eat real flesh.\u201d And that is the linchpin to the entire debate around fetal bovine serum: the general population\u2019s refusal to accept the consequences of traditional meat production. \u201cThe current models of meat and leather production are problematic, but there are simple ways to solve it, and that\u2019s to just stop using them,\u201d said Catts. \u201cOne of the decisions I made for myself after doing this research, after eating [in vitro] meat, is that I\u2019ve basically stopped eating meat. That\u2019s such an easy way of solving it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a good business model.\u201d",
