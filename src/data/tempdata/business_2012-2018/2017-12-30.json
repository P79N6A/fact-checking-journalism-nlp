      "bodyText": "The consensus view among economists is that the global economy will put in a strong performance in 2018, carrying on its strong momentum from 2017. However, that does not mean that every sector and every company will have a trouble-free year. Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary will need to repair staff relations, jobs will leave the City of London and inequality will widen. Our financial and economic specialists predict the big stories in 2018. A good year overall \u2026 The global economy is set fair in 2018. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently upgraded its forecast for global growth to 3.7%, to reflect the return to health of manufacturing in most of the developed world and China. Manufacturing growth was at a standstill in 2014, as China stemmed the flow of unprofitable cheap exports and the eurozone wrestled with the Greek debt crisis. This year has proved more buoyant. A dramatic rise in global trade pushed factories across the world to their highest output for decades during November. It is a trend that forecasters expect to continue into 2018. Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts, which were pushed through Congress at breakneck speed, are another shot in the arm \u2013 even if the only effect is to raise business and consumer confidence levels over the next year. Oil prices have risen sharply to more than $60 a barrel from a low point below $40 last year, but analysts expect further rises to be muted, allowing growth to continue without an increase in fuel costs putting on the brake. The IMF highlighted Brexit as a possible drag on the prospects for growth, along with high levels of global debt. But with stock markets hitting new highs at the end of the year, the picture remains quite rosy. Phillip Inman \u2026 but shares might ease off After a year of booming stock markets around the globe, commentators are virtually unanimous in predicting that returns in 2018 won\u2019t match those of 2017. The S&amp;P 500 surged 20% this year to a new record high, the Dax index in Germany jumped 13% and, in Paris, the market was up 10%. The FTSE 100 has also reached record territory, moving above the 7,600 level for the first time just before Christmas. But its year-on-year gain is only 7%, reflecting widespread concerns over Brexit, the economy and feeble wage growth. It remains only a few per cent above its previous high of nearly 7,000 in the final days of the tech boom of 1999-00. Wall Street, by contrast, has risen 75% since then. Could 2018 be the year the FTSE\u2019s relative underperformance improves? If Brexit negotiations go more smoothly than predicted, interest rates remain low and wages pick up, then domestically focused UK stocks could be the surprise winners (with foreign buyers taking advantage of sterling\u2019s weakness). How to play it? After his annus horribilis, fading star fund manager Neil Woodford could see his fortunes recover \u2013 but he\u2019s still very concerned about overvalued markets globally. Patrick Collinson Netflix and Amazon on the up By the end of next year, services such as Netflix and Amazon will have become as popular with British TV viewers as \u201ctraditional\u201d pay-TV companies such as Sky and BT. The number of pay-TV customers signed up to the main UK providers \u2013 Sky, Virgin Media, BT and TalkTalk \u2013 is expected to reach almost 16.8 million by the end of next year. By then, the number of people paying for subscription video-on-demand services (SVOD) \u2013 Netflix and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video being by far the most popular \u2013 is forecast to hit about 16.7 million. When the margin for error in the forecasts is factored in it is possible that SVOD services, which include Sky\u2019s Now TV and smaller fare such as family-focused DisneyLife, could prove even more popular than pay-TV. \u201cIn a few short years, Brits have flocked to these new streaming services, which have become a household staple,\u201d says Richard Broughton of Ampere Analysis. \u201cThe UK is one of a handful of markets around the world leading the charge, embracing online viewing.\u201d However, Sky and friends won\u2019t be fearing for the future of their business models just yet. Largely, consumers are taking services like Netflix alongside pay-TV packages from businesses like Sky, with only 29% saying they choose SVOD specifically over pay-TV. Mark Sweney City jobs on the move Next year is key for the City and banking. Brexit-related job moves are expected as banks begin to implement plans to keep doing business once the UK leaves the EU. The speed and scale of the Brexit moves \u2013 which, says the Bank of England, could affect 10,000 jobs by \u201cday one\u201d in March 2019 \u2013 will depend on whether a transition period can be agreed and what sort of trading arrangements are made after Brexit. Many regard Goldman Sachs as a barometer: its new \u00a3350m European headquarters in London is due for completion in March 2019. Decisions about how many of the 10 storeys it will fill could be taken in 2018 \u2013 signalled, perhaps, though Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s active Twitter feed. The Goldman boss taunted the City last year by praising Frankfurt and Paris \u2013 the bank\u2019s preferred post-Brexit hubs. More institutions will follow. Jill Treanor Ryanair still battling with staff The no-frills airline has already moved to placate disgruntled pilots, at least for the time being, by agreeing to discuss union recognition. It has now promised to sit down with cabin crew, who will have been emboldened by the pilots\u2019 success in holding chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary\u2019s feet to the fire. After decades of refusing to recognise unions, it seems unlikely that Ryanair will yield easily to the every demand of either pilots or cabin crew. Should major points of disagreement arise, that could scupper any chance of a swift rapprochement that allows Ryanair to focus on what it does best: flogging more airline tickets than anyone else in Europe. After the embarrassment of two successive waves of flight cancellations in winter 2017, Ryanair will be desperate to stick to its knitting now. That gives cabin crew and pilots more bargaining power than ever before. Rob Davies Nuclear sector in cash struggle The new year will see the backers of new UK nuclear power stations scrabbling for ways to raise the finance for their enormous upfront costs. The first new plant to start construction in more than two decades, Hinkley Point C, loaded all the upfront cost and risk with the developer, EDF. But it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that a new financing model will be needed if the government is to get the new nuclear energy it wants. The use of government equity, or a loan, has already been discussed by Tokyo and London for one such plant, on the Welsh island of Anglesey. Horizon, the Japanese venture behind the project, is in talks with officials and has signalled it wants a decision on financing by mid-2018. And with a new boss at the helm of French state-owned EDF, which has ambitions to build a second plant, Horizon is unlikely to be the only nuclear builder testing the appetite for public finance. Adam Vaughan Global wealth gap to widen The gap between the super-rich and everyone else \u2013 which is already at the widest it has been since the turn of the 20th century \u2013 will continue to widen in 2018 as rich Americans benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful Christmas present\u201d tax cuts. This month, the US president celebrated achieving Congress\u2019s approval for \u201cthe largest tax cut in our history\u201d. Corporation tax will be slashed from 35% to 21%, and the top tax rate cut from 39.6% to 37%. The Tax Policy Center calculates that 62% of the benefits of the tax changes would go to the richest 1% of Americans. The poorest Americans, who don\u2019t earn enough to benefit from the tax cuts, will benefit by about $60 a year \u2013 a 0.4% income boost. The top 0.1% can get their annual incomes to increase by about $190,000 on average \u2013 or a 2.7% increase. The US is already the world\u2019s most unequal society, with four out of five of the globe\u2019s richest people and 41 million officially in poverty, according to the US Census Bureau. The World Inequality Report, produced by French economist Thomas Piketty, warned this month that unless there is globally coordinated political action to increase taxes on the super-wealthy, the richest-of-the-rich will continue to \u201ccapture\u201d more and more of the world\u2019s income at the expense of the poor. \u201cThe global top 1% income share could increase from nearly 20% today to more than 24% by 2050,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn which case, the global bottom 50% share could fall from 10% to less than 9%.\u201d Rupert Neate",

    "webTitle": "VW is raising its profits forecast. Has it cleared the air over dieselgate already?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After a bruising two years, there are signs that Volkswagen is overcoming the damage to its reputation, and finances, wrought by revelations that it had cheated on emissions tests. In November, the Wolfsburg-based manufacturer said it would post record vehicle deliveries this year and higher annual profits. VW, which also owns Porsche, Audi and Bentley among other brands, said it expected to sell more than 6 million Volkswagens this year, boosted by a strong performance in China, Europe and the US. It also said the operating profit margin at the brand could rise to between 4% and 5% by 2020 \u2013 still falling behind rivals such as PSA Group (formerly PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn) and Toyota, but higher than forecast. This from the company that became an emblem of corporate scandal in 2015 when it emerged that it had used software to suppress emissions of nitrogen oxides during vehicle tests \u2013 a scam that affected 11 million vehicles. Aftershocks from the scandal still linger, but the German car giant expects to overtake the \u20ac1.9bn (\u00a31.7bn) of earnings it notched up in 2016. Rising sales of more profitable sport utility vehicles (SUVs), such as its Touareg model, are pushing earnings higher. The more positive outlook has been seized on by analysts and investors. Arndt Ellinghorst, a senior managing director at financial advisory firm Evercore, said: \u201cIt is increasingly hard for investors to ignore the impressive turnaround of VW.\u201d Investors have responded to the positive news, chasing the share price up by 18% over the last three months. This is despite the mounting financial toll of the scandal: it has so far cost VW more than \u20ac25bn and has been the main driver behind its strategic shift towards electric vehicles. The costs include settlements of government and customer lawsuits, repurchases, and retrofits to affected vehicles. It also includes a criminal plea deal in the US, which exacted $2.8bn (\u00a32.1bn) in criminal fines and $1.5bn in civil penalties. It has been a watershed couple of years for the car industry, as rivals scurry to jump on the electric-power bandwagon pioneered by Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla. VW was late to the party, but the so-called \u201cdieselgate\u201d scandal has forced it to accept the new reality. Governments in France, the UK and the Netherlands have backed plans to ban the sale of diesel and petrol vehicles between 2025 and 2040 in a push to clean up polluted cities. Fears about the death of diesel also appear to have hit home with buyers. In November, sales of new diesel cars fell in the UK by more than 30% compared with the same period a year before, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The wider VW Group can see the writing is on the wall for the internal combustion engine. The carmaker\u2019s response has been decisive. It has earmarked \u20ac70bn to produce battery-powered versions of all models by 2030. Paul Nieuwenhuis, senior lecturer at Cardiff University\u2019s Centre for Automotive Industry Research, says VW has come through the worst: \u201cThey are quite resilient \u2026 The problem now is really in the US \u2013 because of the litigation.\u201d The carmaker and two of its executives are still under investigation in Germany and it faces investor lawsuits in the US and at home. Oliver Schmidt, formerly VW US compliance executive, was sentenced to seven years in prison this month after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the US and another of violating the Clean Air Act. Schmidt admitted he was coached to lie about emissions by his bosses at Volkswagen. He is the second employee sent to prison for participating in the emissions-cheating scheme: James Liang, a veteran VW engineer, was sentenced to 40 months in prison in August, having pleaded guilty to conspiracy and cooperated with prosecutors. He has appealed against his sentence. But despite the huge legal challenges in America, sales of VW cars are up 8.3% year-on-year in the US. \u201cThe thing is, they just make good cars,\u201d Nieuwenhuis said. \u201cIt is such a strong brand, people will say \u2018I\u2019m buying a Golf because it\u2019s good value for money\u2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The boss of York-based housebuilder Persimmon is under increasing pressure to donate some of his \u00a3110m bonus to charity, as calculations reveal that his pay deal could be used to provide a council house for every homeless family in Yorkshire. Jeff Fairburn, 53, who joined Persimmon as a trainee when he was 17, will on Sunday receive the first instalment of a \u00a3110m share bonus which has been criticised by politicians, charities and corporate governance experts as \u201cobscene\u201d. The company\u2019s chairman, Nicholas Wrigley, is understood to have suggested Fairburn donate some of the bonus \u2013 which has been largely fuelled by the taxpayer-backed help-to-buy scheme \u2013 to charity. Wrigley quit the company earlier this month, blaming himself for not doing more to cap the amount Fairburn could collect. Fairburn, who grew up in York and went to the city\u2019s Fulford comprehensive school, has repeatedly declined to comment about whether he intends to donate any of his bonus to charity. A spokesman for Persimmon said: \u201cThat is a private family matter for the individuals.\u201d The Guardian has calculated, using government figures, that Fairburn\u2019s \u00a3110m bonus could be used to build 1,375 council houses. A donation of \u00a34.6m \u2013 just 1/25th of Fairburn\u2019s bonus \u2013 could provide a home for all of the 58 homeless families in York. It would cost \u00a360.8m to build a home for all 760 homeless families in Yorkshire and Humber, leaving behind \u00a349m for Fairburn. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader who is also from York, said the \u201cscale of this bonus is obscene\u201d, adding that it was an outrage that Fairburn could profit so much from a \u201cgovernment subsidy\u201d in the help-to-buy scheme. Cable called on Fairburn to do the decent thing at Christmas and give something back to the city that made him and his company. \u201cMy home town is York, and the difference his bonus could make for a place like this is huge,\u201d he said. Rachael Maskell, Labour MP for York Central said: \u201cIt is disgraceful that while Britain faces a housing crisis, housebuilding executives can be paid extortionate bonuses after making huge profits off the back of a government subsidy. \u201cThis money simply should be put to better use \u2013 like ending homelessness in the firm\u2019s own city of York \u2013 rather than further lining the pockets of greedy property developers.\u201d As well as the \u00a3110m that Persimmon is paying out to Fairburn, the company is sharing out a further \u00a3400m to 150 other executives and middle managers. The payouts, made in company shares that can then be cashed in, are linked to the FTSE 100 company\u2019s dividend payments and its stock market performance, which has been significantly boosted by the help-to-buy scheme. Under help to buy, the Treasury provides a loan worth 20% of the value of a property, although the buyer must provide a 5% deposit. The programme has provided a significant boost to property developers\u2019 sales since George Osborne introduced it. Persimmon\u2019s share price has more than doubled since the scheme launched in April 2013. About half of Persimmon homes sold last year were to help-to-buy recipients, meaning government money helped finance the sales. The government has provided loans worth \u00a37bn. Greg Beales of housing charity Shelter, said: \u201cIt is hard not to see this as profiteering from a housing crisis which is getting worse, at a time when more than 300,000 people have spent Christmas without a place to call home. \u201cThe \u00a3110 million paid to just one individual could be used to build enough affordable homes for every homeless person in the city of York. We need to ask ourselves, can such big bonuses really be justified when so many are struggling with the day-to-day reality of our broken housing market.\u201d Fairburn, who lives in a \u00a31m house in Durham and is understood to own another property nearby, declined to comment as to how he intends to celebrate receiving the first wave of his bonus payment on New Year\u2019s Eve. Persimmon, which is named after a racehorse that won the 1896 Derby and St Leger for the Prince of Wales, has been headquartered in York since it was founded in 1972. The company donated \u00a31.1m to charity last year, far below the average FTSE 100 firm donation of \u00a33.8m. Clare Usher of York youth homelessness charity SASH said a donation of as little as \u00a31m \u2013 less than 1% of Fariburn\u2019s bonus \u2013 could guarantee the charity has the funds to help homeless teenagers for four years. \u201cEven if this guy donated just \u00a31m it would cover our funding gap for four years,\u201d Usher said. \u201cWe are looking for local businesses to help us survive, and if a local business is doing so well that it can pay out that much money in bonuses it would be nice if they could contribute to help the local community as well.\u201d Usher said SASH provided help to 300 vulnerable people aged between 16-25 this year. \u201cOur whole work is to try to stop street homelessness,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to stop it before it gets too bad.\u201d Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said Fairburn\u2019s pay was \u201ca prime example of the unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "World equity markets boom Global stock markets have roared ahead in 2017, with the MSCI index of bourses in 47 countries up by 22% and almost $9tn (\u00a36.6tn) according to Reuters. This has been fuelled by a boom in growth among developed nations and Donald Trump\u2019s plan to cut US corporate tax rates \u2013 which is expected to boost company profits in the world\u2019s largest economy and returns to shareholders. China managed to maintain its rate of expansion, dispelling fears over a potential sharp slowdown as it matures after decades of rapid growth, while the eurozone also staged a recovery after years of uncertainty. In Britain, the FTSE 100, packed with companies that earn much of their profit in foreign currencies, has surged as a result of stronger global growth and the weak pound since the Brexit vote. Buoyant global trade The Baltic Dry index is used as a proxy for global growth because it measures dry freight costs for commodities such as coal, rice and wheat. When there is a jump in demand for shipping these products, it signals expansion for the world economy. This year it has risen to its highest levels in four years amid a recovery in global trade. Other barometers for growth, such as surveys of business activity from firms\u2019 purchasing managers, have shown appetite for goods and services in rude health across developed economies in recent months. Still, fears linger over a breakdown in trade from rising protectionism in the US and Europe. Investors stay relaxed Known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is a measure of the stock market\u2019s expectations for how much prices might swing by, up or down, over a 30-day period. The higher the index, the more likely it is investors will be in for a wild ride. This year, the barometer fell to its record low of below 9 points. Anything above 20 indicates that things are going awry, and is a common feature of falling markets. Pound stages Brexit comeback The pound has staged a recovery on global exchanges since the start of the year amid gradual progress in the Brexit negotiations. Although sterling is still about 10% below its level before the EU referendum, the currency has risen by almost 10% this year to stand at about $1.3505. Meanwhile, the dollar has struggled to benefit in 2017 from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes in March, June and December, while the euro has gained ground amid a strengthening eurozone economy and as expectations grow for the European Central Bank to finally start tightening monetary policy by curbing its quantitative easing programme. Eurozone on the mend One of the biggest surprises this year was stability in the eurozone after years of tumult. After the election of Donald Trump, many market watchers expected the next countries to succumb to populist politics would be in the EU \u2013 which could have spelled doom for the single currency. Marine Le Pen failed to take power in France, as did anti-Islam, anti-EU populist Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland in Germany. Meanwhile, amid a more stable political backdrop, growth has roared ahead. Still, accommodative monetary policy that is expected to be gradually withdrawn has helped, with ECB governor Mario Draghi saying the recovery will still heavily rely on stimulus from the central bank for now. Wage growth remains subdued There has been tepid growth in the price of goods around the world, barring the UK, where the pound\u2019s sudden devaluation following the Brexit vote led to surge in imported food and fuel costs. Wage growth in particular was missing in action in 2017, despite low rates of unemployment across most major developed economies. This has left many in the economics profession puzzled, because tight labour markets typically lead to greater levels of bargaining power among workers to demand higher wages. It also poses an additional challenge to central bankers \u2013 who would like to see stronger wage inflation before they raise interest rates, normalising the world economy after years of stimulus in the wake of the global financial crisis that started 10 years ago. Productivity puzzle persists The failure to drive up the productivity of workers has puzzled economists the world over this year, not least in the UK. Although the problem is particularly sharp in Britain, each of the G7 nations has experienced sluggish growth since the crash a decade ago. That\u2019s a worrying sign for wage growth, because greater output per hour worked, or per worker, can help to support higher pay for that output. The culprit could be higher levels of employment, low interest rates, or low levels of investment in productivity boosting projects by governments and businesses. In the UK, weak productivity growth was behind a sharp downgrade to GDP growth alongside Philip Hammond\u2019s budget in November. It\u2019s also one of the key reasons why UK workers aren\u2019t expected to see their wages after inflation go back above pre-crisis levels until the mid 2020s. Oil bubbles up The global oil price has recovered sharply in 2017, benefiting from increasing demand from factories around the world, particularly in China, amid a boom in economic activity. After crashing in late 2015 to spook global markets, this year has been one of calm and steady gains. Opec has reined in production to keep a lid on supply, while there have been no major escalations in tensions to drive up the price to unsustainable levels. One warning: US shale oil production may start to come back online at current prices, as the more expensive costs involved with extraction become economical once more. This could boost supply, leading prices to fall. Bitcoin mania takes hold Probably the financial story of the year. Even though there are fears of a coming crash, 2017 will go down as the year of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin\u2019s rise has been meteoric, beginning the year valued at about $1,000 and reaching almost $20,000 by the middle of December. There have been wild swings on the way, with the currency losing more than a quarter of its value in a single day this month, before staging a recovery. Economists think bitcoin has all the telltale signs of a bubble, with worrying parallels to the Tulip mania of the 17th century, when the price of bulbs crashed in spectacular fashion after a buying frenzy. Chinese debt worries China\u2019s rapidly accumulating debt pile, having quadrupled since the financial crisis, became of increasing concern this year \u2013 although has not yet roiled the global markets. The International Monetary Fund warned that Chinese debt is now high versus international norms and that rapid growth may have led to an unwillingness among officials to let struggling firms fail. In September, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s downgraded its credit rating citing the risks from total debts in, which have quadrupled since the financial crisis. While China has started taking steps to rein in debt without having affected growth so far, economists worry a wrong move by officials could upset the apple cart in the near future. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Other barometers for growth, such as surveys of business activity from firms\u2019 purchasing managers, have shown appetite for goods and services in rude health across developed economies in recent months.
