The shares closed on Monday at 61.62p, still below the 73.6p average price that taxpayers paid for their stake in the bank. But they are above the 61p that the chancellor has signalled could be used as a point to begin a sell-off. George Osborne is expected to use his Mansion House speech to the City later this month to set out his approach to reducing the taxpayer stakes in both Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, in which the taxpayer has an 81% share holding, possibly through a distribution of shares to the public. Raising his price target for the Lloyds shares by 12p, John-Paul Crutchley, analyst at UBS, said the bank's profits should rise in the coming years as its margins began to rise while its costs and provisions for bad loans fall. He set out the investment case of Lloyds as \"a market-leading high-return UK retail bank where excess capital is distributed to shareholders\". UBS, which acts as broker to the bank, said that Lloyds' shares had risen 29% so far this year. \"Although recent performance has been strong, we see potential for further re-rating over the coming 12 months as Lloyds completes its transition from restructuring and shrinkage to profitability and balance sheet growth,\" UBS said. Lloyds has been selling off troublesome loans to bolster its capital position to plug a capital shortfall identified by the regulators and also shrinking its lending. \"We expect both core lending and mortgage lending to grow in the second half of 2013,\" UBS said, as Lloyds will benefit from improving demand, government initiatives and a more resilient housing market. \"With regulatory dilution risk eliminated, we believe that the main consideration for a prospective Lloyds investor should be future earnings power and capital distribution,\" UBS said. Lloyds has not paid a dividend since it rescued HBOS in September 2008 and was banned from making such payments to shareholders by the European Union as a result of the bailouts. That ban has now been lifted but payments have yet to resume. The 61p level for a potential sell-off emerged in March when the Treasury linked a potential bonus for the Lloyds boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio to selling off part of the government stake at this price. UBS expects Lloyds \u2013 which has sucked \u00a36.6bn out of lending since June last year according to Bank of England data \u2013 to \"open the tap\" on new lending in the second half of the year, which will benefit the bank and the UK economy. Lloyds owns the Halifax, traditionally the country's biggest mortgage lender.",

OMT would not, he insisted, let governments slack off - as they must agree to make reforms in return for the ECB's support.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They can either reform <em>without</em> OMTs and retain economic sovereignty or they can reform <em>with</em> OMTs but give up some of their economic sovereignty. Either way, they have to persevere in their reform efforts.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also denied that it would undemine the independence of the ECB, or that borrowing costs across the eurozone would actually be driven too closely - as investors could still calculate that one country was a riskier bet than another.</p> <p>And finally, Draghi warned that OMT cannot address the biggest problem in the eurozone today - record unemployment.</p> <p>He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Always and especially in the present situation, the need for governments and parliaments to reform does not stem so much from the bond market but from the dramatic conditions in the labour market.</p> <p>Unfortunately, millions of unemployed are a much greater driver to reform that the interest rate to be paid on sovereign debt.

We will be back on Tuesday with more from around the eurozone, the UK and beyond. KA This is turning into a bit of a long goodbye, but a quick look at tomorrow's key scheduled market events before we sum up today and then snatch the last bit of sunshine here in London. Tuesday kicks off with the latest policy announcement at 5.30am UK time from Australia's central bank, which is expected to keep its cash rate steady at 2.75%. It caught many market players by surprise with its quarter-point cut a month ago. Capital Economics comments: The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) meeting will be a close call, but we expect the central bank to keep interest rates on hold. However, we still think the RBA will cut rates again before the end of the year to boost the non-mining economy. Later on, at 9.30am, Markit publishes its PMI survey for the UK construction sector - less closely watched than its report on the vastly bigger services sector due on Wednesday. Eurozone producer prices data is out at 10am and in the US, April's trade balance is published at 1.30pm UK time. Before we close for the day, some news just in from our correspondent Helena Smith over in Greece. She reports optimism is the name of the game ahead of a crucial inspection tour of the country\u2019s finances \u2013 at least officially. Amid renewed talk of a restructuring of Greece\u2019s staggering debt load, finance minister Yannis Stournaras is being even more upbeat than usual as he prepares for the arrival in Athens of officials representing the EU, ECB and IMF. \u201cAs far as the fiscal crisis is concerned we are two-thirds of the way through and for the first time we are expecting a primary surplus,\u201d he told me in a telephone chat. \u201cAs far as competitiveness is concerned we have, in terms of unit labour costs, almost recovered completely since entry to the euro.\u201d The implementation of long-overdue structural reforms and liberalisation of \u201cclosed-shop\u201d professions, however, still remained outstanding \u201cand has to be done,\u201d he said. Greece\u2019s \u2018troika' of creditors has made clear that the disbursement of 3.3bn euro of rescue funds owed to Athens will also depend on prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 coalition government moving ahead with the privatisation of ailing state companies which are also long over-due. Stournaras strongly rejected suggestions that on the ground Greeks were far less optimistic citing recession, now in a sixth year, worsening poverty and the eurozone\u2019s highest unemployment rate at 27%. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d the economics professor said. \u201cThe European commission measures confidence indicators and there is a huge improvement in March, April and May.\u201d The FTSE 100 has closed down 58 points, or 0.9%, at 6525 after concerns about the US Federal Reserve withdrawing its economic stimulus weighed on stock markets all day. Weaker data out of China also put pressure on stocks while mixed manufacturing numbers in PMI reports from around the rest of the world made little impact. Lex Young, senior sales trader at CMC Markets UK sends this update: The softer tone of the past fortnight has followed through into the first session of the month today, as traders continue to concern themselves with the likely impact if stimulus provided by Fed asset purchases is prematurely withdrawn. Small beats on PMI data across Europe this morning failed to inspire much change to the generally cautious mood, as the \u2018all news is good news\u2019 mantra has taken an about turn over the past 2 weeks. Here is a summary of where markets around the world stand shortly after the UK close: That link in the IMF's tweet on Germany doesn't appear to be working, but you should be able to get the details here. The IMF comments: Amid still elevated euro area uncertainty, we now project GDP in Germany to expand at around 0.3% in 2013. A gradual pick-up in activity projected towards the end of the year is conditional on a further and tangible reduction in this uncertainty and a materialization of the expected gradual recovery in the rest of the euro area. The IMF had been forecasting 0.6% growth A quick look now at the markets in the wake of that weaker than expected US manufacturing data. The dollar is falling against the yen and the euro while US bond prices have erased their earlier losses on the back of growing bets the Federal Reserve will need to take more action to shore up the US recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average has held onto gains and is up 0.6% at 15,198. James Knightley at ING Financial Markets highlights a sharp fall in new orders in the ISM report and a fall in the production index with the \"one relative bright spot\" being the fact that the employment component was barely changed at 50.1. He continues: We had thought that a sub-50 reading was on the cards given the disappointing regional PMIs. The only one to perform well was last Friday\u2019s Chicago PMI, but that index is one of the poorer guides to the ISM. With the Chinese PMIs not performing particularly well and the Eurozone index remaining in contraction territory today\u2019s ISM report suggests that the global growth story might not be as robust as markets were increasingly pricing in. As a result we still see the risk that Federal Reserve QE tapering is delayed until much later in the year with the December FOMC looking as a more likely start point rather than September. US manufacturing activity shrank in May for the first time in six months, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Its headline index of factory activity fell to 49.0 in May, worse than expectations for it to hold at April's reading of 50.7. That was the first reading below the 50-mark that divides growth from contraction since November 2012, when America's east coast had been left reeling from a massive storm. The survey contrasts with the UK's latest manufacturing report out earlier today, that showed the sector growing at the fastest pace in more than a year. Canada's manufacturing PMI has risen to its highest level in almost a year, according to the latest release from Markit. At 53.2, May's PMI suggested the sector picked up after April's 50.1 (which indicated minimal growth). More details here. And with that I'm handing over to Katie Allen. Thanks all. GW America's manufacturing sector posted slightly more rapid growth than expected last month, according to the first of two Purchasing Managers Indexes being released this afternoon. Markit's US PMI for May beat forecasts with a reading of 52.3, which means growth picked up after April's six-month low of 52.1. The key points points are: \u2022 Modest increases in both output and new orders \u2022 Weakest rise in employment since last November \u2022 Rate of input price inflation quickens, but remains slower than series average In under an hour's time we'll get the ISM survey of the US manufacturing sector for May Turkey's stock market continued to fall when trading recommenced this afternoon, pushing the main index down almost 10% at one stage (it's currently almost 8% down for the day). investors kept selling as police reportedly used tear gas in an attempt to break up the anti-government demonstrations when began four days ago (see also 11.54am). Interesting story on AP this lunchtime about a loan programme being drawn up by the Germany government to help small Spanish companies. The scheme would help SMEs in Spain to access affordable credit, according to a draft document. German state-owned KfW bank would lend \u20ac1bn to its Spanish equivalent, ICO, which could use the money to increase its lending to small firms. The full story's here: Germany to help Spain with credit for growth, jobs Here's a flavour: The initiative could also be extended to other countries, such as Portugal, that have been hit hard by the 17-nation eurozone's debt crisis, German Deputy Finance Minister Steffen Kampeter said in the document obtained by The Associated Press. The German initiative's design as \"bilateral aid with rapid impact\" reflects growing impatience in Berlin about the slow progress by the EU in freeing up existing funds to assist hard-hit countries. Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, is expected to give more details of the plan on Wednesday. The French government has announced some cuts to welfare entitlements today, in a sign that it is committed to reducing its borrowing, But President Francois Hollande's government appears to be taking the pruning shears to public spending, rather than the axe which critics claim is needed. Today's changes to the family benefits system will save up to \u20ac2bn a year from France's system of family benefits. \"It Is perfectly possible to reduce our deficit while preserving the core of our social model,\" Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told journalists as he presented the plan. Reuters has more details: The changes will stop short of cutting allowances outright for high-earning families, as had been floated by some officials. Instead, the bulk of the savings will come from reducing the income tax exemptions that wealthy parents can claim according to the number of the children they have. The proposed reform also includes some new spending, which means that the net saving will be \u20ac1.7bn from 2016. That saving will not go a long way towards reducing France's overall budget deficit, but the move sends a signal to France's European Union partners that it is prepared to make politically sensitive reforms, having been given two extra years to meet a budget deficit goal of 3% of output. UPDATE: IfigEusLannuon has pulled together more details in the comments below In the financial markets, shares have fallen sharply in Turkey as anti-government protests entered their fourth day. The main index in Istanbul, the BIST 100, dropped by 6.67% in morning trading, while the Turkish lira slid to a 16-month against the US dollar. There was also a selloff in Turkish government debt, driving up the yield (or interest rates) on its bonds, as investors took their first chance to respond to a weekend of clashes between police and demonstrators. The crisis escalated last night as prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said opposition politicians had inflamed the protests, as around 10,000 demonstrators swelled Istanbul's main square calling for his resignation. Social media and opposition to blame for protests, says Turkish PM The Turkish stock market reopens this afternoon, but here's the situation at lunchtime. Analysts fear that Turkey's could destabilise further if the global economy weakens. Timothy Ash, head of emerging markets research at Standard Bank, warned: The risk clearly is that this all just drags on and then the danger is that violence racks up a notch taking this to an entirely different level - further heightening tensions and entrenching positions. Virginie Maisonneuve, head of global and international equities at Schroders, told CNBC that the protests could get worse if the economy in Turkey stalled further. Here's CNBC's take: Turkish Stocks Slide as Protests Enter Fourth Day \"One of the things that we're watching carefully is the deficit. Because although it's one of the best performing countries versus other emerging markets, given the size of the deficit what happens to the oil price is very important to them,\" she told CNBC Europe's \"Squawk Box.\" \"What has interested me is how the oil price has remained quite stable despite anemic growth around the world\u2026but if you believe we're on the path to normalization you have to really watch what the oil price is going to do and what the impact will be on Turkey. Our full news story on the revival in the UK manufacturing sector is now live, by my colleague Katie Allen: Britain's manufacturers enjoyed a stronger-than-expected rebound in business last month, fuelling hopes that the sector will boost overall economic growth this quarter. Manufacturing activity grew at its fastest pace for more than a year as new orders and output both picked up pace, according to the closely watched Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing PMI survey. Sister surveys in the eurozone showed the manufacturing picture there brightened markedly too, although the sector remained in decline. UK manufacturing grows at fastest rate since March 2012 Greek police officers have launched an investigation after three explosive devices were detonated this morning, at two Greek government ministry offices and a research organisation. A woman was taken to Evangelismos hospital for treatment to minor burns after an explosion outside the ofice of the Justice Ministry's general secretary for transparency, Giorgos Sourlas, on the fifth floor of an apartment block. The blast occured around 8am local time, and has been condemned by the government. Kathimerini reports: Government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou condemned the \"cowardly\" attack and wished a speedy recovery to the victim, calling on other political parties to speak out against \"violence in public life.\" The homes of Kedikoglou and his brother were both targeted in bloodless bomb blasts in recent months. The other two explosions occured at 3am outside a building housing the ministry for environment, physical planning and public works, and outside an office of the Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research (IOBE). Both caused minor damage but no injuries. Economist are encouraged that the decline in the eurozone's manufacturing output eased last month, and that UK growth picked up pace. Reaction in the City is more muted, though. EEF Chief Economist Ms Lee Hopley May\u2019s rebound in UK manufacturing activity signals the strong likelihood of a positive second quarter for the sector. Broad based improvements across industry supported by rising order inflows, even from parts of Europe where the pace of contraction is now starting to ease, provide some reasons for cautious optimism that manufacturing growth is turning a corner. While the survey notes that increased activity is feeding through to more recruitment, we also need to ensure that conditions are right for manufacturers to bring forward plans to increase business investment too. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight May\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 survey supports hopes that overall manufacturing activity across the Eurozone could be moving towards stabilization, although it is not there yet.... The upside for domestic demand in the Eurozone remains constrained by restrictive fiscal policy in many countries (despite increased flexibility now being allowed on fiscal targets), still tight credit conditions, high and rising unemployment, and limited consumer purchasing power. This is particularly true of the southern periphery Eurozone countries, and we expected extended contraction in both Italy and Spain to weigh down appreciably on overall Eurozone GDP in 2013. We also suspect that France will suffer modest contraction in 2013. Meanwhile, global growth is muted and stuttering, which is currently limiting the upside for Eurozone exports. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets Small beats on PMI data across Europe this morning failed to inspire much change to the generally cautious mood, and it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see similar levels of apathy at 15.00 this afternoon when the US ISM number hits the tapes. This graph shows how manufacturing output across the eurozone started falling around two years ago, with many countries suffering steady declines since (although this morning's better-than-expected data gives encouragement - see 9.27am for more details). Britain's manufacturing sector grew at its fastest pace in 14 months, hot on the heels of the eurozone's own improved performance (see 9.27am). Markit reported that the UK manufacturing PMI rose to 51.3, which shows respectable growth. April's data was also revised up to 50.2, from 49.8, which means the sector did not shrink as previously thought. Stronger domestic demand and a \"modest increase\" in new exports \u2013 thanks partly to demand from Germany \u2013 helped the sector grow, and led to the first rise in job creation since January. The figures were well-received in the City, pushing the pound higher. Rob Dobson, Senior Economist at Markit, predicted that manufacturing growth will continue through the summer months: Output is also likely to be raised further in the coming months, as firms refill warehouses after stronger than expected demand has led to a sharp depletion in finished goods stocks. The tentative return to job creation in the sector in May also suggests that manufacturers are becoming more confident in the outlook. Although the domestic market was the main impetus to new order inflows, demand from overseas markets at least managed to keep its head above water, as higher demand from Asia, North America and pockets of the Eurozone, notably Germany, kept the recovery in new export orders alive. It's official - the eurozone's manufacturing slump may finally be easing, but it's not over yet. Markit's survey of firms across the single currency zone showed that output fell at its slowest rate since February 2012. At 48.3, May's manufacturing PMI showed a clear improvement on April's 46.7. The drop in new orders eased, helping to stem the ongoing decline in output. However, celebration was muted as the figures still showed the 22nd monthly contraction in a row. The improvement was partly due to signs of recovery in Spain (see 8.38am), and better-than-expected data from Italy (see 8.57am). Markit said there was a better performance across the board, including Greece's best reading in two years. Here's the details: Germany 49.4: 3-month high Netherlands 48.7: 3-month high Austria 48.2: 3-month high Spain 48.1: 24-month high Italy 47.3: 4-month high France 46.4: 13-month high Greece 45.3: 23-month high Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the figures were reassuring --even though the euro area's manufacturing economy continued to contract in May. The sector still seems some way off stabilising, however, and therefore remains a drag on the economy. Markit believes eurozone GDP probably shrank by 0.2% this quarter, which would mean the recession would have last for 21 months. Williamson added: Policymakers will nevertheless be pleased to see the downturn not getting any worse, suggesting the ECB will see no immediate need for further action at its June meeting. In particular, the surveys brought good news in terms of signs of stabilisation in Germany and export-led growth in Italy and Spain, the latter suggesting structural reforms are boosting competitiveness. However, the data showed Europe's second-largest economy is still struggling, Williamson warned: France remains a key concern, having contracted at a steeper rate than Spain and Italy throughout the year so far. The ongoing marked fall in employment and the steepest drop in factory gate prices for three-and-a-half year also act as sobering reminders that the region faces the twin problems of unemployment rising to new record highs and underlying deflationary pressures. Here's the full release from Markit. Reaction to follow.... Further good news. France's manufacturing output has shrunk at its lowest pace in over a year (with a PMI of 46.4, up from 44.4). And Germany's manufacturing PMI also hit a three-month high of 49.4 -- still shrinking, but closer to the crucial 50-point mark that shows growth. Another piece of encouraging news from the eurozone periphery -- Italy's manufacturing sector shrank at a slower rate in May. The Italian PMI index rose to 47.3 last month, up from April's 45.5. That's a four-month high, and a better result than economists had expected. It still means that Italian manufacturing output shrank again, and is some way from the 50-point mark that shows growth. But following Spain's strong reading (8.38am), it may indicate conditions are improving. Markit reported that the \"rates of decline in output, new orders and employment all slowed,\" along with \"an accelerated rise\" in new export orders. This graph shows how Italy's industrial sector has been buffetted since the eurozone crisis took hold (the blue line shows the monthly PMI figures) And Phil Smith, economist at Markit. explained: There were a number of positives to be taken from the latest PMI figures despite them showing the sector still in contraction, not least a much slower decrease in the level of new orders. This was in part due to firms having more success in foreign markets, which for the moment looks to be the most promising route to recovery while domestic demand remains subdued due to weak sentiment and the ongoing effects of austerity. Smith added that factory employment and output had both decreased at slower rates. Meanwhile, Netherland's manufacturing sector shrank at its slowest rate in three months: That strong Spanish manufacturing data is online here (pdf). Much better than expected manufacturing data for Spain has just been released, offering hopes that the country's long recession could be easing. The monthly PMI (Markit's survey of output across the sector) rose to 48.1 in May - a two-year high, and much much stronger than April's 44.7. The data still shows that Spain's manufacturing sector contracted for the 25th month in a row - but at a much slower rate. Particularly encouragingly for Spain, the data showed an increase in export orders. The backlog of work also fell, while the rate of decline in output, new orders and employment all \"eased markedly\". Andrew Harker, economist at Markit, struck a cautiously optimistic note: The Spanish manufacturing sector moved much closer to stabilisation in May, but the extent to which this is reliant on export growth is a cause for concern as domestic demand shows little sign of revival. Much will depend on whether improving export demand can be sustained over coming months, and help to build confidence across the wider economy. City experts cheered the news: Another lively day on the Japanese stock market ended with the Nikkei hitting a six-week low. The Nikkei dropped by 3.7%, or 512 points. to 13,261, its lowest level since mid-April. The weak Chinese manufacturing data (see 8.06am) was one factor, along with the usual worries over Japan's stimulus package and the chances of the Federal Reserve ending its own measures. Kenzaburo Suwa, strategist with Okasan Securities, explained to AFP that traders had also been catching up with falls on Western stock markets last Friday. On top of that, Japanese shares are still in the middle of adjustment following the recent surge. The market is trying to find a short-term bottom, which has yet to be seen. Overnight, new manufacturing data has fanned fears that China's economy is slowing down. The HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index for May fell to 49.2, down from April's final reading of 50.4. That's the lowest level since October 2012, and means that the sector shrank slightly. The reading was also lower than the official Chinese government survey, released on Saturday, which showed a slight rise to 50.8. Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC, said the report suggested \"a marginal weakening of manufacturing activities towards the end of May, thanks to deteriorating domestic demand conditions\". Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone and the global economy. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has kicked off the week with a full-blooded defence of his bond-buying plan, ahead of a German legal challenge later this month. Speaking in Shanghai, Draghi insisted that his Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) plan, drawn up almost a year ago, had helped to eliminate \"the unwarranted anticipation of euro area breakup\" \u2013 even though not a single government bond has been bought. The mere promise that the ECB would step in and prevent a country's borrowing costs soaring to unsustainable levels has, he said, helped to calm the panic and bring the eurozone back to normality. Peripheral sovereign bond yields and corporate borrowing costs have fallen significantly since last summer, as fears over a eurozone break-up receded. Draghi told the International Monetary Conference: The establishment of OMT has therefore been beneficial to everybody: sovereigns, corporations, banks as well as individuals, and it has benefitted both periphery and core countries. It may sounds like Draghi's tooting his own trumpet, but the comments come just a week before Germany\u2019s Constitutional Court considers the legality of OMT. That case, on June 11-12, has been brought by the German Bundesbank, which remains concerned that buying unlimited quantitaties of debt issued by eurozone countries would violate German law. Draghi didn't mention the case, but instead laid out a three-point defence of the plan. OMT would not, he insisted, let governments slack off - as they must agree to make reforms in return for the ECB's support. They can either reform without OMTs and retain economic sovereignty or they can reform with OMTs but give up some of their economic sovereignty. Either way, they have to persevere in their reform efforts. He also denied that it would undemine the independence of the ECB, or that borrowing costs across the eurozone would actually be driven too closely - as investors could still calculate that one country was a riskier bet than another. And finally, Draghi warned that OMT cannot address the biggest problem in the eurozone today - record unemployment. He explained: Always and especially in the present situation, the need for governments and parliaments to reform does not stem so much from the bond market but from the dramatic conditions in the labour market. Unfortunately, millions of unemployed are a much greater driver to reform that the interest rate to be paid on sovereign debt. And unfortunately, OMTs have almost no effect on the sources of employment creation. Monetary policy, after all, can only do so much. The full speech is online here. I'll watch out for reaction to Draghi's speech through the day, along with other key events. On the economics side, we get manufacturing output figures for the eurozone, the UK and the US. We've already had new data from China this morning, suggesting that output contracted.... (more to follow...)",

      "bodyText": "Lending to businesses has continued to contract, despite a \u00a316.5bn Bank of England handout to lenders since last August, raising fresh doubts about the effectiveness of the government's flagship funding for lending scheme (FLS) in bolstering credit to households and businesses. Data released on Monday showed a \u00a3300m reduction in lending in the first three months of the year and put pressure on bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group to justify their \u00a310.5bn reduction in lending since the end of June last year. Since last August, \u00a31.8bn of credit has been drained out of the system At the same time, up to 40 lenders have accessed the \u00a316.5bn in funding from the FLS. Andrew Bailey, a deputy governor of the Bank of England and boss of the new Prudential Regulation Authority, insisted that it was not the new requirements for banks to hold additional capital that caused lending to fall. \"I want to reassure you that is not the case,\" Bailey told an audience of economists. \"Additional capital supports lending by banks and does not substitute for it.\" Lending at the two state-supported banks, along with Spanish bank Santander, fell sharply according to the FLS data.

The Co-op has halted all small-business lending while it tries to stabilise its business after its credit rating was slashed to junk status. Building societies increased their lending and Barclays is extending additional credit to businesses and households. RBS said the figures included planned runoffs of commercial property loans while Lloyds insisted the fall was because it was \"running down certain non-core parts of our business\". The reduction in lending \u2013 which is hitting businesses harder than households, which are receiving attractive mortgage offers from lenders \u2013 brought fresh calls for a state-backed bank. The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"We need a properly resourced state investment bank that can provide the assistance firms need to grow and create jobs.\" John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, called for a \"swift delivery\" of the business bank being developed by Vince Cable. The business secretary, who has previously expressed concerns that forcing banks to hold more capital could restrict lending, said the business bank would help. \"Whatever the banks claim about lack of interest, the truth is it has become more difficult for those SMEs that need to find finance,\" said Cable. The Bank of England said it would take time for the FLS to feed through to positive lending. Paul Fisher, executive director for markets at the Bank of England, said: \"The plans of the FLS participants suggest that net lending volumes will pick up gradually through the remainder of 2013.\" Bailey told his audience lending was expected to decline and that first year of the FLS \"needs to be judged against a worse outlook for lending a year ago\". The pace of contraction in credit had slowed since the last quarter of 2012, when \u00a32.4bn was sucked out of the economy, and in April the FLS was extended to a wider range of financial firms such as leasing companies. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the latest data showed why the scheme had been expanded. Bailey has been leading discussions with banks about plugging a \u00a325bn shortfall in capital identified by regulators. Only Lloyds and RBS have said publicly they can find the extra capital they need by selling off businesses, and Bailey said they had not been \"let off the hook\" by not being forced to raise fresh capital. \"Both of these institutions have a come a long way from their original business plans,\" said Bailey. \"These banks have agreed to do what we have asked and we will hold them to that. That is a regulator's promise,\" he said, noting the stream of disposals by both banks to bolster capital.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's manufacturers enjoyed a stronger than expected rebound in business last month, fuelling hopes that the sector will boost overall economic growth this quarter. Manufacturing activity grew at its fastest for more than a year as new orders and output both picked up pace, according to the closely watched Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing PMI survey. Sister surveys in the eurozone showed the manufacturing picture there brightened markedly too, although the sector remained in decline. The UK report's headline activity index rose to 51.3 in May from an upwardly revised 50.2 in April. That was well ahead of the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and easily beat forecasts for 50.2 in a Reuters poll of economists. It was the highest reading since March 2012. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said that a \"brightening\" domestic market boosted the sector. \"Output is also likely to be raised further in the coming months, as firms refill warehouses after stronger than expected demand has led to a sharp depletion in finished-goods stocks. The tentative return to job creation in the sector in May also suggests that manufacturers are becoming more confident in the outlook,\" he added. Economists said the report suggested manufacturing's recession was drawing to a close in the UK. \"Today's survey is a tentatively encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector may start to play a part in the overall economic recovery,\" said Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics. The survey signalled that the growth in manufacturing, which accounts for around a tenth of the UK economy, was broad-based with a pick-up for consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors. Factories linked higher output to \"improved new order inflows, successful new product launches and efforts to clear backlogs of work\", the report added. Domestic demand was the main driver behind the third consecutive monthly rise for new orders. For exporters, there was higher demand from Germany, France, east Asia and North America, where many UK companies have been seeking out new business as their traditional European trading partners continue to struggle. The PMI reports from the eurozone underlined continuing economic challenges there, with the headline reading for the eurozone at 48.3 in May, the 22nd month below 50. Still, that was up from 46.7 in April and the highest since February 2012. Economists highlighted signs of some stabilisation in the sector but said overall the currency bloc's downturn would drag on. \"Although the euro area manufacturing economy continued to contract in May, it is reassuring to see the rate of decline ease to such a marked extent,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. \"The surveys still suggest that GDP is likely to have fallen 0.2% in the second quarter, extending the region's recession into a seventh successive quarter.\"",

Murthy, who co-founded Infosys in 1981 with $250, was the company's first chief executive, until 2002, and chairman, retaining the latter position and that of \"chief mentor\" until 2011. Analysts welcomed the 66-year-old's return, which drove the shares up by more than 9% in early trade on Monday. They later dropped back to trade 4% higher on the day. Ankur Rudra of Ambit Capital said: \"This is a drastic, some might say, welcome move. Probably, this could be a step towards a new strategic direction and leadership as well.\" Bringing back a former chief is no guarantee of success, although proponents of the move will likely cite the triumphant return of Steve Jobs to Apple in 1997. At the time, the company he co-founded in 1976 was battling for its life. But, under his second reign, it developed the iPhone and iPad and became the world's most valuable technology company. Howard Schultz performed a similar revival at Starbucks, when he returned as chief executive in 2008 after an eight year hiatus. Its shares have since risen more than eightfold from a low of $7.17 in 2008. But Michael Dell has been less successful. He returned in 2007 to the computer maker he founded only to find an industry in crisis, as consumers turned to tablets and smartphones instead of new PCs. The company recently recommended Dell's offer to take it private in a leveraged buyout worth $24.4bn, or $13.65 a share \u2013 a far cry from the $56-plus high of the dotcom boom.",
