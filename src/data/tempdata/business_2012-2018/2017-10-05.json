      "bodyText": "The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, has issued an unprecedented apology to his pilots in an attempt to stem the crisis at the Irish airline, which has cancelled thousands of flights and faced the threat of an employee revolt. The airline had to scrap the bookings of more than 700,000 passengers last month due to an apparent shortage of pilots, having failed to plan for enough leave for staff. Ryanair hoped a bonus payment could entice some pilots to change their holiday plans, but O\u2019Leary then further inflamed the situation with disparaging comments about pilots at the airline\u2019s annual meeting in Dublin. On Thursday, the outspoken boss sent an extraordinarily contrite letter to pilots at the airline \u201cto apologise personally to each of you for the disruptions you have experienced\u201d. O\u2019Leary had accused pilots of being \u201cprecious about themselves\u201d and \u201cfull of their own self-importance\u201d, adding: \u201cI would challenge any pilot to explain how this is a difficult job or how it is they are overworked, or how anybody who by law can\u2019t fly more than 18 hours a week could possibly be suffering from fatigue.\u201d He said that the comments had been directed at \u201cpilots of competitor airlines and their unions\u201d, a favoured refrain of O\u2019Leary\u2019s when addressing those who have criticised his employment model. \u201cI have the utmost respect and admiration for Ryanair\u2019s pilot team,\u201d he said. The letter offered a range of improvements to terms and conditions, including salary increases, loyalty bonus payments, improved rostering and better compensation for those pilots forced into working away from their home base. But it warned pilots against taking alternative employment with other airlines, particularly Norwegian, where hundreds are thought to have decamped. A graph of his rival airline\u2019s tumbling share price, along with some choice financial facts, was appended to the letter. O\u2019Leary warned earlier this year that Monarch, which collapsed into administration this week, and Norwegian would not survive the winter. The letter, however, showed that the airline\u2019s management is extremely conscious of the extent of pilot anger. O\u2019Leary warned that he would stick with Ryanair\u2019s \u201cemployee representative committees\u201d, the forums it claims do the job of unions, which it refuses to recognise. He said the committees would be the only way to negotiate better pay and warned pilots \u201cyou and your colleagues will suffer\u201d if they were ignored. Pilots around Europe are unofficially organising, with many seeking union recognition. Ryanair staff in the UK hope to come together to halt its practice of negotiating individual deals with bases. A number of pilots remain under tax investigation after working for Ryanair through one of its intermediaries, which instructed them to form companies as effective self-employed contractors \u2013 a practice which has attracted the attention of authorities around Europe. About half of Ryanair pilots are not officially employed by the airline. The Civil Aviation Authority has pledged to monitor Ryanair\u2019s treatment of passengers in the wake of the mass flight cancellations, after giving it an ultimatum to finally inform disappointed customers of their full rights or face legal action. \u2022 This article has been amended to correct a misspelling of \u201cjibes\u201d in the headline.",

      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs has begun to make plans for Brexit by leasing space in a new Frankfurt tower block that could hold up to 1,000 staff. The Wall Street bank, which employs 6,000 staff in the UK, has been searching for office space in the German financial centre for the last six months as it looks to continue operations across the EU after Brexit. The bank is taking the top eight floors of a new 37-storey block known as Marienturm, which is under construction and expected to be ready for occupation in the third quarter of 2019. It currently has just 200 staff in Frankfurt. \u201cThis expanded office space will allow us to grow our operations in Germany to continue serving our clients, as well as provide us with the space to execute on our Brexit contingency plan as needed,\u201d Goldman Sachs said. Richard Gnodde, chief executive of its international arm, has previously said the bank\u2019s plans include hiring extra staff in the remaining 27 EU nations to cope with the extra business which will be channelled through Europe instead of London. The bank did not say what the implication was for jobs in London, but the news came amid warnings that unless a transitional deal can be agreed with the EU before Christmas firms could have to start taking steps to move jobs and business out of London on the assumption there will be a hard Brexit. Sam Woods, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, told an audience of financiers this week that the further away an agreement is from Christmas, the less effective it would be in helping to reassure City firms about the changes they need to cope with the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. He has already asked 400 financial firms which operate in the UK for their Brexit plans and is monitoring their responses. For Goldman Sachs, the UK\u2019s departure from the EU in March 2019 coincides with its scheduled move into a new 10-storey building under construction in London that is intended to replace its three offices in the capital. The bank has the option to take all the floors or sublet space. Gnodde has said previously that job numbers would depend \u201con the outcome of [the Brexit] negotiations and what we are obliged to do because of them\u201d amid speculation that up to half of its 6,000 London-based roles could go. According to a tally of job announcements kept by the City of London Corporation \u2013 the local authority for much of the financial district \u2013 Frankfurt is in the lead of all the remaining EU cities in attracting roles. More than 9,750 potential job moves have so far been announced.",

      "bodyText": "With Spanish shares recovering despite the continuing tensions between the government and Catalan separatists, European markets managed to end the day higher. The exception was Germany, which slipped back from its record highs. In the UK, a weakening pound gave some support to the FTSE 100, dominated as it is by overseas earners who benefit from a fall in sterling. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 40.41 points or 0.54% higher at 7507.99 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.02% to 12,968.05 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.3% to 5379.21 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.49% to 22,566.03 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 2.51% at 10,214.7 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.79% at 744.80 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 91 points or 0.4%, ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over in Spain, the stock market has recovered much of Wednesday\u2019s slump, as Spain rules that Catalan\u2019s parliament should be suspended on Monday, thus ruling out an expected vote on independence. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The IBEX 35 is the best performer in Europe, which make a nice change seeing the Spanish market lost the most ground this week. Madrid and Catalonia are still at loggerheads, and the Spanish government has suspended Catalan\u2019s parliamentary session which was due to take place on Monday. Only the Parliament of Catalonia can declare independence, and since Madrid has prevented the meeting from taking place there isn\u2019t much the separatists can do. Nonetheless, investors will be fearful of the Spanish stock market while the Catalan question hangs over the country. The pound\u2019s weakness against the dollar could be temporary, suggests John Higgins at Capital Economics: Although sterling has fallen sharply against the dollar over the past fortnight or so, we forecast that the exchange rate will end this year and next at $1.35/\u00a3, above its level now of $1.31/\u00a3. Sterling\u2019s drop on Thursday appears to have been prompted by unexpectedly-weak car sales in the UK..and growing doubts over PM Theresa May\u2019s future. The economy as a whole seems to be holding up quite well, though. And we don\u2019t expect it to be derailed by political uncertainty unless we end up with a new prime minister with a markedly-different view of how Brexit negotiations should proceed. That risk aside, sterling\u2019s exchange rate against the dollar will probably continue to be driven by shifting views of monetary policy. Expected interest rates shot up in the UK in mid-September after the MPC signalled that it might raise Bank Rate sooner than investors had expected. But expected interest rates then rose further in the US after the FOMC\u2019s meeting later in the month, when participants\u2019 projections suggested that a hike in the federal funds rate in December remains on the cards. This helps to explain why a fall of more than 2% in the dollar against sterling between these two policy meetings has since been more than unwound. Other \u201cmajors\u201d have still fared worse than sterling against the US currency since the MPC\u2019s last meeting, though. We think that the contrast between policy rates in the US and UK at the end of next year will be a bit starker than investors appear to be anticipating. Our view is that the gap will be minus 1.00-1.25 percentage points (pp), which reflects forecasts of 2.25%-2.50% for the US and 1.25% for the UK. The gap implied by our forecasts for policy rates would be broadly consistent, on the basis of past form, with a slightly weaker dollar/sterling exchange rate than the one that we are projecting. But the difference is not large. And we suspect that the exchange rate will find some support late next year from the prospects for monetary policy in 2019. We forecast that the gap in policy rates will shrink to minus 0.75-1.00pp during that year, as the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle ends in the spring while the MPC\u2019s continues gradually. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: Sterling\u2019s suffering was exacerbated this afternoon by a beefed up showing from the dollar. Cable plunged as much as 0.9% this Thursday, dragging the pound to a sub-$1.325 4 week nadir against the greenback. Sterling also maintained a half a percent drop against the euro \u2013 which itself fell 0.3% against the dollar \u2013 sporadically causing the pound to dip below \u20ac1.12, a level it hasn\u2019t seen since mid-September. As has been the case all day, there isn\u2019t any one great defining factor either driving the pound lower or the dollar higher, but rather a web of news items highlighting the impact of Brexit uncertainty for the former and suggesting a hawkish Fed for the latter. Cable is likely to remain the dominant force on Friday, as investors gear up for a potentially crucial (and likely hurricane hit) set of non-farm figures. Still with the US, and factory goods orders rose by more than expected in August. New orders increased by 1.2%, following a 3.3% drop recorded in July and better than the forecast 1% rise. On the recent hurricanes the Commerce department said: \u201cWe cannot isolate the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma on either the Advance Report or Full Report on Manufacturers\u2019 Shipments, Inventories and Orders, because the survey is designed to estimate the month\u2010to\u2010month change in manufacturing activity at the national level and not at specific geographic areas.\u201d US markets are continuing their winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 12 points in early trading while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasday Composite have opened at new record highs. Williams however will not vote on interest rates this year, so if they do rise in December it will not be down to him: The dollar of course is being supported by the expectation of a US rate rise before the end of the year. And new comments from San Francisco Fed president John Williams in a speech in Missouri do little to dispel that idea: The pound is on track for its worst week against the dollar since November 2016, according to Reuters. The pound continues to fall, now down a cent or 0.8% against the dollar at $1.3135. The UK currency is now at its lowest since early September and has lost all the gains (and more) that it made after the Bank of England suggested rates might rise in November. Worries about a challenge to Theresa May as UK prime minister following her conference speech has unsettled investors, since a weakened leadership is hardly ideal for the crucial Brexit negotiations. The latest poor economic data - in the shape of disappointing car sales - also point to an economy which would struggle to accommodate increased borrowing costs. Indeed, ratings agency S&amp;P suggested that very thing this week. Meanwhile the strong US data - service sector on Wednesday, jobless claims now - is helping to push the dollar higher. Over in the US, and weekly jobless claims have come in better than expected. Ahead of the non-farm payrolls numbers tomorrow, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell by 12,000 last week to 260,000. Analysts had been expecting a figure of around 265,000. But the impact of the recent hurricanes makes the picture a little difficult to assess. The department said: \u201cHurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria impacted this week\u2019s claims.\u201d Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: President Trump will be quick to point towards the strength of the labour market on the back of today\u2019s positive jobless claims data. The initial impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have typically increased the number of new applications for unemployment benefits. However, today\u2019s dip dampens fears of job growth restraint in the coming months. Initial jobless claims are unlikely to return to August\u2019s record lows for a while yet, though. Weekly claims had previously been operating at their lowest level since the early 1970s, but with many businesses yet to reopen in the wake of the natural disasters, a number of Americans are still faced with little choice but to seek unemployment benefits. Here\u2019s a nice chart from the BBC, showing how diesel\u2019s share of UK car sales has shrunk, while electric vehicles are carving out a bigger slice of the market. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, says the drop in UK car sales is part of a wider problem: \u201cThis is an economy being driven into the ditch. Sales of cars last month were down 9.3 per cent compared to a year earlier. This is worrying not only for the car industry but speaks to a deeper economic malaise with anaemic economic growth figures this year and real wages lower than ten years ago. The country desperately needs a bold, transformative industrial strategy which only a Labour government will deliver.\u201d This chart shows one reason why Britain\u2019s economy is in a mess - productivity has been persistently weak since the financial crisis, repeatedly defying forecasts of growth. The decline in car sales highlights the pressure on chancellor Philip Hammond to deliver an impressive budget next month. The government desperately needs something to cheer about, following the debacle of Theresa May\u2019s speech yesterday. Hammond could improve the mood with some growth-friendly policies, tax cuts or spending pledges. Abolishing the public sector pay cap, for example, might give the Tories a boost. But there\u2019s a problem. Britain\u2019s economy has only expanded slowly this year, so Hammond has less wriggle-room than previously expected. Weak GDP growth means the UK\u2019s official fiscal watchdog may revise down its assessment of the UK economy. That would wipe out much of the \u00a326bn which the chancellor set aside for a rainy day in 2016\u2019s autumn statement. Chris Giles, economics editor of the Financial Times, reckons that two-thirds of Hammond\u2019s war chest has been wiped out. He writes: Philip Hammond is facing what officials describe as \u201ca bloodbath\u201d in the public finances in his Budget next month as weak economic forecasts derail the government\u2019s plans. As much as two-thirds of the \u00a326bn of headroom in the public finances that the chancellor created last year as a buffer for the economy through the Brexit period is likely to be wiped out after the government\u2019s fiscal watchdog concludes its forecasts for growth have been too optimistic. The Office for Budget Responsibility will publish on Tuesday a new analysis suggesting it has persistently over-estimated Britain\u2019s productivity over the past seven years and will give a broad hint that it will rectify the situation with a more pessimistic Budget forecast. Slower growth in the forecast will limit deficit reduction and cut the size of the war chest that Mr Hammond put aside to smooth the Brexit transition. This leaves him in an awkward position politically, since he is under increasing pressure to end the austerity cap on public pay, lower the burden of debt on students and build houses. More here. Sales of new vans in the UK also fell in September, by over 4%, indicating that British businesses are cutting back. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports that: Demand for new vans declines -4.2% in September to 57,368 units. Pickups and heavier van demand broadly stable, rising 0.4% and 0.1% respectively. Year-to-date registrations drop -3.1% overall, as business confidence dented. SMMT chief Mike Hawes says: Business confidence has taken a hit recently as economic and political uncertainty continues, so fluctuations in purchasing patterns are to be expected. The 21% slump in diesel car sales has been welcomed by Friends of the Earth, the environmental campaign group: Conversely, sales of electric cars jumped by 41% in October, from 16,000 to over 22,000. Alternatively fuelled cars now make up 5.4% of the market. Labour MP Chuka Umunna says the decline in UK car sales shows that Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is causing significant harm to the UK ecnoomy. \u201cThis is yet more evidence that Brexit is having a serious and damaging impact on our economy and on the livelihoods of the British people. Higher inflation, lower growth and greater uncertainty are all taking their toll. These new figures suggest that households are feeling the pinch. \u201cCar sales tend to be a barometer for the overall health of our economy, which makes this news even more concerning. \u201cThe Government has a duty to put our economy and living standards first in the Brexit negotiations. That is why they should end their ideological red lines, give people and businesses certainty, and abandon their plan to leave the Single Market and the Customs Union.\u201d Ian Gilmartin of Barclays Corporate Banking says the 9.3% slump in car sales in September was a poor result, but not unexpected given the drop in consumer confidence. New plate months are always crucial, and some were pinning their hopes on the usual biannual boost providing a bit of respite ahead of further tough times, but that hasn\u2019t materialised. The result isn\u2019t a surprise because across a number of retail sectors consumers are understandably becoming more reluctant to commit to high value purchases. Add to that the ongoing confusion over diesel models, which posted a 22% drop last month, and it\u2019s easy to see why the overall figures have dipped so much. Sue Robinson, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association (NFDA), says worries over diesel\u2019s future are partly to blame. \u201cConsumers walking into the showroom need more clarity on issues such as diesel and air quality. We are working closely with car retailers to assist them in educating their customers.\u201d Andy Bruce of Reuters points out that motor retailers have warned that business conditions have deteriorated: Nissan managed to beat Ford to the top of the best-sellers table last month: Chris Bosworth, director of strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance, says anxiety over the UK\u2019s exit from the EU has hurt demand for cars. September traditionally delivers a peak as the new registration plates are introduced, but it appears that the motor industry is struggling to shake off the impact that Brexit uncertainty is having on consumer spending. We are already seeing the consequences of the weak pound on UK manufacturers\u2019 profit margins, and this has made it difficult for dealers to offer customer deals, especially the 0% finance offers which would have been abundant in previous years. Here\u2019s a handy chart showing how UK car sales have declined this year: Diesel car sales slumped by over 20% in September, as British drivers continue to shun them following recent emission scandals. Around 170,000 new diesel cars were registered last month, down from almost 218,000 in September 2016. That follows the revelation that Volkswagen had used \u2018cheat software\u2019 to make their cars seem less polluting. The SMMT claims that this trend is \u201cthwarting the ambitions of both industry and government to meet challenging CO2 targets\u201d. That\u2019s because diesel cars emit less greenhouse gases than petrol models. However, they also emit toxic nitrogen oxides, which cause tens of thousands of deaths each year A crackdown on older, more polluting diesel cars is now underway - London is introducing a new emissions charge to deter them entering the capital. The value of used diesel cars has fallen sharply in recent months, as consumers worry that some cities could ban them altogether.... The decline in car sales last month was wide-ranging. Businesses bought 5.2% fewer cars, sales to private buyers fell 8.8%, while \u2018fleet\u2019 sales dropped by 10%. Sales of luxury saloons slumped by over a third, while supermini sales dropped by 21%. The slump in September sales means that new car registrations have fallen by 3.9% since the start of 2017. Unless the market picks up, we could see the first drop in annual sales since the last recession. BREAKING: Car sales across the UK fell by 9.3% in September. That\u2019s the sixth monthly decline in a row, and raises the real risk that British car registrations post their first annual decline since 2011. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders blames a fall in consumer confidence, due to \u201ceconomic and political uncertainty\u201d and confusion over the government\u2019s air quality plans As this charts shows, it\u2019s the first decline in September sales in six years. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said, September is always a barometer of the health of the UK new car market so this decline will cause considerable concern. Business and political uncertainty is reducing buyer confidence, with consumers and businesses more likely to delay big ticket purchases. The confusion surrounding air quality plans has not helped, but consumers should be reassured that all the new diesel and petrol models on the market will not face any bans or additional charges. Manufacturers\u2019 scrappage schemes are proving popular and such schemes are to be encouraged given fleet renewal is the best way to address environmental issues in our towns and cities. More to follow.... Sterling has hit a three-week low against the US dollar, shedding half a cent to just $1.318. Fresh speculation over Theresa May\u2019s future, ongoing Brexit worries, and today\u2019s weak car sales are all weighing on the pound. Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies at Algebris Investment, blame the prime minister\u2019s nightmare speech yesterday: Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says there is plenty of bad news chipping away at the pound. There were the lingering effects of Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s comment yesterday stating that it is \u2018sceptical\u2019 of a Bank of England rate hike. Keeping with the BoE, deputy governor Sam Woods argued that a transition deal with the EU would need to be in place before Christmas to prevent an exodus of City jobs out of the UK. Then there was the report that car sales may have fallen 10% in September, leaving the UK industry on track for its first annual decline since 2011. Britons are cutting back on new sofas, as well as new cars, it seems. Furniture maker DFS just posted a 22% drop in pretax profits over the last year, and warned that trading conditions are tough. Ian Filby, DFS\u2019s chief executive, told the City this morning: The UK furniture market continues to be very challenging and the outlook for the sector remains uncertain. DFS appears to be another victim of weakening consumer confidence, and rising inflation which has pushed up import costs and driven down real wages. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: Big ticket items like sofas tend to be the first things consumers cut back on when they are feeling the pinch, and a slew of poor sales data from the car industry corroborates that trend. Things don\u2019t look like they are getting much easier either, with DFS expecting weak trading conditions to continue into the next financial year. The SMMT\u2019s communications director, Tamzen Isacsson, blames economic and political uncertainty for the drop in UK car sales: Reuters has a good explanation of why UK car sales have declined for the last six months: Sales have fallen year-on-year since April due to a combination of factors including increased vehicle excise duty, weaker consumer confidence, partly due to uncertainty around Brexit, and comparisons with record sales in 2015 and 2016. Diesel car sales have been worst hit as consumers fear new levies and possible restrictions on their use in urban areas as the government continues to consult on ways to reduce pollution. SMMT chief Mike Hawes also warns that car manufacturers are putting off new investment until they know what\u2019s happening with Brexit. Hawes says Britain\u2019s auto industry enjoyed a \u201ctremendous run\u201d of investment, around \u00a32.5bn per year for the last five years. But.... investment fell by a third in 2016, and is \u201cdown markedly again this year, Hawes says. He blames uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union: \u201cPeople are waiting to see what the future relationship with our biggest market, Europe, is going to be before making any additional investment.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone crisis and business. Britain\u2019s car industry is facing its first drop in annual sales since 2011, after suffering a sharp drop in demand last month. Figures due out at 9am today will show that new car registrations fell for the sixth month running in September. September is usually a bumper month for the industry because licence plates change (meaning motorists can proudly drive away with a \u2018brand new car\u2019 to impress the neighbours). But not this year. Industry experts warn that sales may have fallen by nearly 10% year-on-year in September. That means there\u2019s now a serious danger that British car sales will shrink in 2017, for the first time since 2011. Mike Hawes, the head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says we should brace for a bad set of figures. Speaking on that BBC Today Programme, Hawes warns: Sales have been falling for six months and that trend is probably going to be magnified given the size of the September market. So we\u2019re probably going to see something over 9% in September. Hawes blames falling consumer morale, saying: The confidence that people have in making big-ticket items\u2026 is just declining. He also cites uncertainty over the figure of the car industry itself. Recent warnings from the government that petrol and diesel car sales could be banned by 2040 have left consumers confused. We\u2019ll bring you the full picture of the UK car industry at 9am today. Also coming up today... The Catalan crisis continues to loom over the European financial markets, with speculation that the region could vote on declaring independence next week. We\u2019ll also be watching the energy sector, following the government\u2019s move to introduce a price cap on bills. It\u2019s not as simple as that, though, as my colleague Adam Vaughan explains: Theresa May\u2019s pledge to cap \u201crip-off\u201d energy prices is about as clear as the average electricity and gas bill. The prime minister promised to introduce a draft bill next week to give the energy regulator, Ofgem, powers to cap the bills of people being \u201cpunished\u201d for their loyalty and their inability to shop around. But the Conservatives later admitted that they were only giving Ofgem the powers to impose a cap for everyone on a standard variable tariff, not actually ordering the regulator to impose it.....

David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The IBEX 35 is the best performer in Europe, which make a nice change seeing the Spanish market lost the most ground this week. Madrid and Catalonia are still at loggerheads, and the Spanish government has suspended Catalan\u2019s parliamentary session which was due to take place on Monday. Only the Parliament of Catalonia can declare independence, and since Madrid has prevented the meeting from taking place there isn\u2019t much the separatists can do.

The economy as a whole seems to be holding up quite well, though. And we don\u2019t expect it to be derailed by political uncertainty unless we end up with a new prime minister with a markedly-different view of how Brexit negotiations should proceed.</p> <p>That risk aside, sterling\u2019s exchange rate against the dollar will probably continue to be driven by shifting views of monetary policy. Expected interest rates shot up in the UK in mid-September after the MPC signalled that it might raise Bank Rate sooner than investors had expected. But expected interest rates then rose further in the US after the FOMC\u2019s meeting later in the month, when participants\u2019 projections suggested that a hike in the federal funds rate in December remains on the cards.</p> <p>This helps to explain why a fall of more than 2% in the dollar against sterling between these two policy meetings has since been more than unwound. Other \u201cmajors\u201d have still fared worse than sterling against the US currency since the MPC\u2019s last meeting, though.</p> <p>We think that the contrast between policy rates in the US and UK at the end of next year will be a bit starker than investors appear to be anticipating. Our view is that the gap will be minus 1.00-1.25 percentage points (pp), which reflects forecasts of 2.25%-2.50% for the US and 1.25% for the UK.</p> <p>The gap implied by our forecasts for policy rates would be broadly consistent, on the basis of past form, with a slightly weaker dollar/sterling exchange rate than the one that we are projecting. But the difference is not large. And we suspect that the exchange rate will find some support late next year from the prospects for monetary policy in 2019. We forecast that the gap in policy rates will shrink to minus 0.75-1.00pp during that year, as the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle ends in the spring while the MPC\u2019s continues gradually.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59d6436be4b00593b4d66f24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-05T14:37:22.031Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sterling\u2019s suffering was exacerbated this afternoon by a beefed up showing from the dollar.</p> <p>Cable plunged as much as 0.9% this Thursday, dragging the pound to a sub-$1.325 4 week nadir against the greenback.

      "bodyText": "Almost all Australians \u2013 93% \u2013 have thrown away a five-cent coin for being annoying to carry, according to a study of more than 1,000 people by the banking group ING. The survey revealed a growing disdain for cash payments across most age groups, and said our aversion to carrying coins costs individuals up to $10 a month in lost change. According to the researchers, Australian adults lose an estimated $38m every month, or $2.10 per person on average. But younger Australians lose more, with 40% of millennials and 36% of Gen Xers losing $10 each month. Only 19% of those aged 50-64 lost a similar amount. More than one in four (28%) of respondents said they hated carrying coins, and 49% said they would regularly make payments on mobile when possible. A comparative international ING survey in February found 27% of Australians carried cash \u201cnot often\u201d or \u201calmost never\u201d. Only 10% of Germans gave those responses, while the US was near the top of the cashless table at 34%. Almost one in four Australians (24%) said they would go completely cashless if they had the choice. Reasons cited by respondents in the most recent study for binning the tiny five-cent piece included inconvenience (29%), bulking up a wallet (27%) and the simple fact that people \u201ccan\u2019t use five cents\u201d (40%). But Clara Choi, a medical student at the University of Sydney, said she regularly collected coins and took them to the bank. \u201cI collect coins when I clean my room and deposit them at an ATM when the tin is getting heavy,\u201d she said. \u201cMy boyfriend and I leave coins in our pockets which end up on the floor when we do the laundry.\u201d Despite her thrift, Choi echoed the sentiment that coins were inconvenient: \u201cThey\u2019re only good for buying coffee.\u201d Another postgraduate student, Lachlan Anderson, said he preferred cash to card or phone payments. \u201cCall me paranoid but I don\u2019t really like the idea of all my purchases being tracked. But I also get irritated when too many coins build up in my wallet, as it\u2019s a literal pain in the arse. \u201cMy usual response to this is to occasionally offload all my silver into the tip jar of whatever cafe I happen to be buying my coffee from, keeping just the precious, precious gold. \u201cAs an Australian, this is one of the few good reasons I can think of for actually leaving a tip.\u201d Other young people Guardian Australia spoke to said they put their loose change in charity donation boxes or saved them for the self-service checkouts of supermarkets. The study found that men were more careless of change than women, with a third of men losing $10 per month, compared with a quarter of women. In February last year, the chief executive of the Royal Australian Mint, Ross MacDiarmid, said the five-cent coin was \u201cdying a natural death\u201d and would fade out of circulation within 10 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a halving of the demand for five-cent pieces over the past five years and our expectation is that it will just simply progress, it\u2019s lost its utility, it will lose interest from the public,\u201d he said. Last year, 22.5m five-cent coins were produced, compared with 21.2m in 2015. A 2016 survey of consumer payments conducted by the Reserve Bank found 52% of payments were made with a card and 37% with cash. The use of cash dropped from 47% in 2013 and 69% in 2007. The fall was across all age groups, with 51% of payments in cash by Australians over 65 in 2016, down from 78% in 2007. Last financial year the Royal Australian Mint saw an unexpected rise in demand for coins, attributed to supply chain disruption and \u201chigher demand in tighter economic conditions\u201d. Under the Currency Act, the maximum value of five-cent coins someone can hand over to a shopkeeper is $5.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New car sales in the UK fell for a sixth month in September, leaving the market on course for its first annual decline since 2011. Car registrations dropped by 9.3% to 426,170, the first time the September market has declined in six years. The Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT) and Traders blamed declining consumer confidence given uncertainty over Brexit and confusion over air quality plans. Sales of diesel cars crashed by 21.7% last month. September, when number plates change, is a key month for car sales. New car registrations have fallen 3.9% over the first nine months of 2017 and are expected to record a fall over the year as a whole. The SMMT had been expecting an annual decline because previous years were strong, but it now looks as though that drop may be bigger than expected, a spokeswoman said. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThis is an economy being driven into the ditch. This is worrying not only for the car industry but speaks to a deeper economic malaise with anaemic economic growth figures this year and real wages lower than 10 years ago. The country desperately needs a bold, transformative industrial strategy.\u201d Richard Jones, the managing director of motor finance firm Black Horse, part of Lloyds Banking Group, said: \u201cWith the new 67 plates now available, September was an important month for the industry and today\u2019s figures reflect the general slowdown across the market.\u201d Sales of diesel cars have been falling for six years and if this trend continues, CO2 emissions from new vehicles could rise this year for the first time since average CO2 emissions in Britain were first recorded in 2000, the SMMT said. Diesel vehicles were long promoted as being cleaner than petrol cars but recent research suggests that they could be worse for causing carbon emissions. Tax breaks have favoured diesel over petrol, even though they are a leading emitter of the air pollutants nitrogen oxides (NOx), which is responsible for an estimated 70,000 premature deaths in Europe each year. This year, the UK government announced that it would ban all new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040. It followed a similar announcement in France. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cSeptember is always a barometer of the health of the UK new car market so this decline will cause considerable concern. Business and political uncertainty is reducing buyer confidence, with consumers and businesses more likely to delay big-ticket purchases.\u201d He noted that a car is usually the second-largest big-ticket item for consumers, after a property. \u201cThe confusion surrounding air quality plans has not helped, but consumers should be reassured that all the new diesel and petrol models on the market will not face any bans or additional charges,\u201d he added. \u201cDiesel clearly offers benefits in terms of fuel economy and for many customers fuel economy is an important thing,\u201d he said. The biggest declines in September were seen at opposite ends of the market with sales of luxury saloons and superminis falling 36.4% and 21.2% respectively. Demand from business, fleet and private buyers all fell in September, down by 5.2%, 10.1% and 8.8% respectively. Demand for new vans dropped 4.2% in September to 57,368, driven by a fall in sales of smaller vans. Sales of pick-ups and heavier van sales rose slightly. Credit insurance firm Euler Hermes predicts new UK car sales will fall 5% this year to 3m vehicles and 6% in 2018 to 2.8m after five years of growth. The US is the only other global market that will experience declines. Overall, the firm predicts that global vehicle sales will reach 100m by 2019, driven by strong demand in China and India. Sue Robinson, the director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, said: \u201cConsumers walking into the showroom need more clarity on issues such as diesel and air quality. We are working closely with car retailers to assist them in educating their customers.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Government had duty to stop energy firms overcharging, says Clark", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The business secretary has said the government had a \u201cduty to act\u201d to stop energy companies overcharging customers, suggesting households will start to benefit this winter. Asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme whether the proposed energy price cap would be imposed on energy companies this winter, Greg Clark said: \u201cConsumers who are suffering a detriment \u2026 could receive early relief for that.\u201d Clark added: \u201cIf [energy regulator Ofgem] need legal back-up there is a strong consensus in parliament for this, so we will publish legislation and we\u2019ll invite the whole house to endorse this so that they have the legal certainty.\u201d He said he would be surprised if energy companies mounted a legal battle against the price cap, and pointed to \u201cstrong consent in parliament for this\u201d. Clark said \u201cloyal customers\u201d were being overcharged \u00a31.4bn a year, referring to a report by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). \u201cA lot of people see themselves as loyal customers and because the companies know that they\u2019re loyal \u2026 they are overcharging them,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cWhen you are faced with that evidence you\u2019ve got a duty to act.\u201d However, there is scepticism as to how quickly the cap could come into effect. Theresa May pledged to cap \u201crip-off\u201d energy prices in her Tory party conference keynote speech on Wednesday, promising to introduce a draft bill next week to give the energy regulator, Ofgem, powers to cap the bills of people being \u201cpunished\u201d for their loyalty and their inability to shop around. But the Conservatives later admitted that they were only giving Ofgem the powers to impose a cap for everyone on a standard variable tariff, not actually ordering the regulator to impose it. At the moment, when fixed contracts come to an end customers are pushed on to more expensive standard variable tariffs. About 12 million people are on standard variable tariffs. Iain Conn, the chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, Britain\u2019s biggest energy supplier, warned there was a \u201creal risk\u201d that \u201ccheap deals go because the mechanism changes\u201d if the government pushes ahead with the price caps. Also speaking on the Today programme, Conn said there was \u201cclear evidence that price caps don\u2019t work\u201d. He added: \u201cIn New Zealand, in Spain, in California and in Ontario they tend to limit choice, reduce competition and prices tend to bunch around the cap.\u201d He noted that a cap on bills for those on pre-paid meters in the UK had left prices typically within \u00a32 of each other this year. A CMA report found customers had paid \u00a31.4bn a year in \u201cexcessive prices\u201d between 2012 and 2015, with those on standard variable tariffs (70% of the total) paying 11% more for their electricity and 15% more for their gas than customers on other tariffs. Clark said: \u201cThis is a big amount and if consumers are being overcharged by \u00a31.4bn a year it is right to act on that. \u201cYou do need competition, but what the competition authorities have established is that the energy market is not working well.\u201d He said there were essentially two markets, with savvy consumers seeking out the best deals online while many others stay loyal to a brand and end up being ripped off.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWelcome to the political hothouse, Dermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem. We\u2019re giving you more powers to regulate the energy market. Specifically, we want you to extract the prime minister from a mess of her own making over energy bills by setting a price cap that does all of the following: it will deliver \u00a3100 a year in savings for households; it will preserve competition between suppliers; and it will maintain incentives for consumers to switch. \u201cPlease do not make trouble by pointing out that these goals may be incompatible in practice. And certainly don\u2019t make a fuss about how independent regulators are supposed to be free to make up their own minds. If you don\u2019t deliver this damned price cap, we\u2019re toast and you\u2019ll have Jeremy Corbyn as your boss. Good luck \u2013 we\u2019re relying on you.\u201d That, more or less, is the government\u2019s latest energy policy. A bill will be introduced to give Ofgem the power to cap standard variable tariffs (SVTs) in England, Scotland and Wales. The regulator will have to be mindful of \u201cthe need to protect consumers and maintain incentives for switching, and for suppliers to innovate, compete and finance their business\u201d. This structure would address one perceived problem. Were Ofgem to propose a price cap now, the energy suppliers might protest to the Competition and Markets Authority in the confident hope of getting it overturned (because the CMA itself rejected a blanket cap only last year). Under the new plan, there is no ambiguity: Ofgem\u2019s word would be final. Jolly good, but will Nolan jump through the hoop Theresa May is frantically waving? Hard to say. On one hand, he doesn\u2019t sound impressed with the way the market is working at present. On the other, a full SVT price cap, as opposed to one that merely protects \u201cvulnerable\u201d customers, would run counter to the pro-competition regulatory philosophy of the past 25 years. The risk is that companies yank their discount fixed-price tariffs and switching dries up. It\u2019s probably best not to try to guess Nolan\u2019s response, assuming the bill gets though parliament, but it is easy to see that the plot could turn messier. The government has semi-promised savings of \u00a3100 a year for households on SVTs. Yet it is relying on somebody else to make it happen. And it is skipping over the fact that customers who switch between fixed tariffs could end up paying more. What could possibly go wrong? Tesco share price shows turnaround packaging nice, but contents same Is the great corporate turnaround at Tesco as phoney as the farm brands that replaced various own-label ranges? A glance at the share price would suggest so. On the day in September 2014 that the freshly arrived chief executive, Dave Lewis, had to tell investors that profits had been overstated, the share price fell to 203p, which was an 11-year low at the time. Now that three years\u2019 hard work is supposedly coming good, the shares are even lower, at 184p. Lewis can\u2019t control the share price, of course, but you can understand why investors are underwhelmed. First, Tesco\u2019s recovery is happening, but progress looks a slog. Half-year headline figures, such as the 23.7% improvement to \u00a3759m in operating profits, met City expectations, but the missing ingredient is momentum. Like-for-like sales in the UK rose by 2.3% in the first quarter but fell to 2.1% in the second. Both numbers would have counted as strong a year ago, but inflation is blowing through prices these days. In a turnaround that was advertised as volume-led, Tesco\u2019s volume of transactions advanced by only 0.3% in the half. That\u2019s better than most competitors are managing, says Lewis, but it\u2019s not going to excite investors. Second, there are factors that Tesco can\u2019t influence. Consumers\u2019 real incomes are being squeezed. Aldi and Lidl continue to act as price policeman \u2013 and Amazon may join them before long. On the plus side, Lewis can point to more solid financial foundations. Debt has fallen sharply on his watch, thanks to disposals and cash generation, and the deficit in the pension fund looks less daunting after a tweak to assumptions about mortality and investment yields. And, on the usually reliable principle that bonus-chasing bosses only set targets they are confident of achieving, Tesco\u2019s profit margins will probably hit the 3.5%-4% range within two years, allowing the dividend to improve from the token distribution unveiled on Wednesday. Maybe that will be the moment when the City gets excited. For the time being, the correct stance on the turnaround tale is the one that also applies to the made-up farm brands: nice packaging, but what\u2019s really different?",

    "webTitle": "Over half of new cancer drugs 'show no benefits' for survival or wellbeing", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Most cancer drugs that have recently arrived on the market have come with little evidence that they boost the survival or wellbeing of patients, research reveals. Forty-eight cancer drugs were approved by the European Medicines Agency between 2009 and 2013 for use as treatments in 68 different situations. But the study, which looked at the clinical trials associated with the drugs, reveals that at the time the therapies became available there was no conclusive evidence that they improved survival in almost two-thirds of the situations for which they were approved. In only 10% of the uses did the drugs improve quality of life. Overall 57% of uses showed no benefits for either survival or quality of life. The team then looked to see whether the picture improved over time. Huseyin Naci, assistant professor of health policy at the London School of Economics, and a co-author of the study, published in the British Medical Journal, said: \u201cWe wanted to see once [the drugs] were already on the market did they actually generate some evidence to show that they improved or extended life?\u201d The team found that after a follow-up period of between three to eight years, 49% of approved uses were linked to no clear sign of improvement in survival or quality of life. Where survival benefits were shown, the team said these were clinically meaningless in almost half of the cases. \u201cWhat we find very surprising is that not very many studies are looking at overall survival or quality of life as their [primary] objective,\u201d said Naci. He said that instead most of the studies examined indirect measures, such as x-rays or laboratory tests that were assumed to offer clues as to a drug\u2019s survival benefits. He added: \u201cUnfortunately the expectation is that once the drugs are on the market then companies will be investing in [longer term] trials to then demonstrate overall survival benefits. But unfortunately these trials are not necessarily taken up and conducted.\u201d Naci said the findings did not mean patients should worry. \u201cI think it is very important that no one is alarmed,\u201d he said. Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at University of Oxford, described the lack of drug improvement with regard to survival as disappointing, and called for a more rigorous approach to evaluating cancer drugs. \u201cIt is hard to understand why half the drugs were approved in the first place if they provide no clinically meaningful benefit,\u201d he said. But Winette van der Graaf, professor of personalised oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research, said that making decisions based on smaller studies looking at benefits other than overall survival, were important in making sure new treatments were swiftly made available to patients. \u201cIn my area of research [on] rare cancers the level of evidence called for here is very hard to obtain, meaning that these patients would find it extremely difficult to gain access to new treatments,\u201d she said, adding that large trials looking directly at survival could be expensive and lengthy. \u201cIdeally, studies should try also measuring early markers of treatment failure, so that health authorities can make well-balanced decisions.\u201d Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK\u2019s director of policy, warned that the study did not necessarily reflect the situation in the UK where Nice (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) played an important role in deciding which drugs were available to patients. \u201cThe study does highlight the importance of using real-world evidence from patients, on top of data from clinical trials, to build our understanding of how drugs work in a real-life setting. We\u2019re already starting to see this happen through the cancer drugs fund in England, where patients can access promising new drugs while more data is collected on their effectiveness.\u201d",

Where survival benefits were shown, the team said these were clinically meaningless in almost half of the cases.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we find very surprising is that not very many studies are looking at overall survival or quality of life as their [primary] objective,\u201d said Naci. He said that instead most of the studies examined indirect measures, such as x-rays or laboratory tests that were assumed to offer clues as to a drug\u2019s survival benefits. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/03/the-immune-system-the-great-new-hope-of-cancer-treatment\">The immune system: the great new hope of cancer treatment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added: \u201cUnfortunately the expectation is that once the drugs are on the market then companies will be investing in [longer term] trials to then demonstrate overall survival benefits. But unfortunately these trials are not necessarily taken up and conducted.\u201d</p> <p>Naci said the findings did not mean patients should worry. \u201cI think it is very important that no one is alarmed,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.carlheneghan.com/\">Carl Heneghan</a>, professor of evidence-based medicine at University of Oxford, described the lack of drug improvement with regard to survival as disappointing, and called for a more rigorous approach to evaluating cancer drugs. \u201cIt is hard to understand why half the drugs were approved in the first place if they provide no clinically meaningful benefit,\u201d he said. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/researchers-and-teams/professor-winette-van-der-graaf\">Winette van der Graaf</a>, professor of personalised oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research, said that making decisions based on smaller studies looking at benefits other than overall survival, were important in making sure new treatments were swiftly made available to patients.</p> <p>\u201cIn my area of research [on] rare cancers the level of evidence called for here is very hard to obtain, meaning that these patients would find it extremely difficult to gain access to new treatments,\u201d she said, adding that large trials looking directly at survival could be expensive and lengthy. </p> <p>\u201cIdeally, studies should try also measuring early markers of treatment failure, so that health authorities can make well-balanced decisions.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p> Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK\u2019s director of policy, warned that the study did not necessarily reflect the situation in the UK where Nice (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) played an important role in deciding which drugs were available to patients.</p> <p>\u201cThe study does highlight the importance of using real-world evidence from patients, on top of data from clinical trials, to build our understanding of how drugs work in a real-life setting. We\u2019re already starting to see this happen through the cancer drugs fund in England, where patients can access promising new drugs while more data is collected on their effectiveness.\u201d </p>",
