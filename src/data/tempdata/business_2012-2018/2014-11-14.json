The kits, which are available for fans as young as two months old and start at around \u00a330, have carried the logo since the start of the 2013-14 season as part of a four-year sponsorship deal worth \u00a324m. Wonga\u2019s backing of Newcastle United has attracted controversy almost since the moment the deal was signed in 2012, with fans\u2019 groups and debt campaigners calling for the club to drop the firm. The pressure has increased this year after Wonga was hit by fines from the City regulator for offering unaffordable loans to consumers and chasing unpaid debts with letters from non-existent law firms. The removal of the logo will not take place until the 2016-17 football season, the final year of the firm\u2019s sponsorship of the north-east club. Wonga said the delay was due to production schedules. The company said it had decided to remove the logo as part of a review of its marketing instigated by its new chairman, Andy Haste.

While key parts of the shipping market such as dry bulk carriers and container ships have continued to struggle against massive overbuilding of tonnage and tepid volume growth, Clarkson has continued to prosper.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Slightly better than expected economic growth figures from France and Germany, and indeed the overall eurozone number as well, have helped support markets ahead of this weekend\u2019s G20 meeting. Greece exited recession, which added to the positive mood, but on the other hand, Italy fell back again. Overall though, it was a fairly upbeat end to the week. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 18.92 points or 0.29% at 6654.37 Germany\u2019s Dax edged 0.05% higher to 9252.94 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.35% better at 4202.46 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.97% to 18,965.41 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.07% at 10,148.0 The Athens market dipped 0.81% to 890.74 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 15 points or 0.09%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. More on the protests in Greece from Helena Smith: Greek students have left a trail of banners and graffiti behind them as they marched through Athens this afternoon. In a display of their dermination against a government they now accuse of employing heavy -handed tactics, in addition to selling out to international creditors, this banner in front of Athens University reads: \u201cPolice get out from the university. Hands off asylum and down with the government\u201d and demands that the rector of the school immediately resigns. Ahead of commemorations marking the 1973 Polytechnic Uprising, the rector has refused to grant students access to university campuses - the asylum long seen as a hallowed right of students after the collapse of military rule in 1974. The main boulevards are peppered with freshly painted slogans some of which have not been seen since the height of the euro crisis. Students marching on parliament this afternoon pledged to step up protests over the weekend with many saying \u201cthe end of the government has arrived.\u201d \u201cThe government has miscalculated gravely on this. All Greece needs is a spark (to erupt) and this may be it,\u201d said a law school student who gave his name as Petros Pappas. Such fears are shared by older Greeks who expressed shock this afternoon at the level of violence used against Athens university on Thursday. \u201cThe violence last night against students protesting peacefully was disproportionate and shows that the government is very fearful of young people becoming the spark of a fire that it won\u2019t be able to comtrol,\u201d said Leonidas Aposkitis, aged 50, who marched through Athens after taking part in Thursday\u2019s demonstration. And yet more positive news from the US economy. Consumer confidence rose to a seven year high in November (so far), helped by falling unemployment - as the Fed\u2019s James Bullard has been saying - and lower petrol prices. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan first reading on its consumer sentiment index came in at 89.4, above the 87.5 reading expected by economists and up from the revised 86.9 seen in October. The better than average performance of the US jobs market is inconsistent with interest rates at near zero, a member of the US Federal Reserve has said. Speaking to an audience in St Louis, Jame Bullard said he did not see low inflation readings as a reason to delay a move away from low rates. He said (courtesy Reuters): [Jobs growth] suggests that over the next year, it will become more and more difficult to point to labour market performance as a rationale for a near-zero policy rate. Bullard is a notable hawk but is currently a non-voting member of the Fed\u2019s rate setting committee, until 2016. Even so, the idea of rising US rates is gaining ground, hence the strength in the dollar. The positive US figures is giving the dollar a lift, with sterling falling to a 14 month low against the US currency. Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst at Caxton FX said: Retail sales data in the US beat expectations this afternoon, coming in at 0.3% when 0.2% was expected. This comes in along with a string of positive data for the US dollar. The dollar index is currently at 88.24, which is its highest point since mid-2010. The US economy continues to be the brighter spot in a global economy that is struggling with growth, thereby boosting the dollar continuously higher. Still with the US, and import prices fell in September by 1.3%, the most in more than two years. The fall was due for the most part to lower costs for imported fuels following the recent crude price slump. The strong dollar also meant that it was cheaper for Americans to buy imports. Export prices fell 1%, as the global economy weakened. Over to the US, and retail sales for October have come in better than expected, a positive sign of returning consumer confidence and good news for the economy ahead of the key Christmas shopping period. Retail sales - excluding volatile elements such as cars and gasoline - rose 0.5% last monthcompared to expectations of a 0.4% rise, and the biggest increase since August. Overall they rose 0.3%, higher than the expected 0.2% increase. The news that Greece has left recession comes as the country is gripped by scenes of protesting students. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, explains: Tensions are very much on rise after overnight riots outside Athens Polytechnic (where the 1973 student uprising set in motion the events that lead to the fall of Greece\u2019s hated military regime) and a student take-over this morning of Thessaloniki University. As I write, students are marching through Athens. Protestors are up in arms over government\u2019s controversial decision to implement a lock-out at all tertiary education institutions in run-up to the anniversary this Monday. Usually, university students have used the three-day period set aside for commemorations to stage sit-ins (that are themselves often marked by clashes between left and right wing students). Tensions have been fueled by anger over tuition costs &amp; other international-mandated educational cuts - and they show no sign of abating ahead of Monday\u2019s anniversary. Videos have been released that also depict riot police using excessive force to remove protestors from the scene of the Polytechnic last night. Riot police resorted to using tear gas and stun guns to remove students from the sight - without giving them any prior warning that they should get out of the way! Outside Athens University\u2019s law School tensions are also high today. On that note, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Richard Boxshall, senior economist at PwC, points out that Europe\u2019s core countries are now lagging behind the periphery, such as Spain and Greece. \u201cToday\u2019s figures show continued very sluggish growth in the eurozone, but it has avoided lapsing back into recession. The former powerhouse of the bloc, Germany, grew at a modest rate of just 0.1% in Q3, while France was the surprise with growth of 0.3%. However, the detailed data showed that the \u2018French surprise\u2019 was primarily driven by relatively strong government spending growth, which is unlikely to be sustainable in the medium term. Meanwhile, Italy has fallen back into a mild recession. \u201cIn contrast, most peripheral countries continue to grow at relatively strong rates with Greece growing seven times faster than Germany, closely followed by Spain and Portugal.\u201d Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes that eurozone leaders must not shelter behind the fact that today\u2019s growth figures could have been worse. He writes: Policymakers are deluding themselves if they believe that narrowly avoiding recession is the same as being on the road to recovery. The eurozone today is starting to look worryingly like Japan in the 1990s: little growth, crippled banks, export dependent. All it lacks to make the comparison complete is deflation, and one further negative shock would make that a reality too. It\u2019s clear what the eurozone needs. It needs monetary activism from the ECB. It needs fiscal activism, both from individual countries and from pan-European institutions such as the European Investment Bank. It needs Germany to realise that generalised belt-tightening has been self-defeating. And it needs all those things fast. Here\u2019s his full analysis: How can the eurozone escape a lost decade? A reminder that Germany and France are above their pre-crisis peaks, but the wider eurozone is not - and Italy\u2019s decline is quite alarming. Chris Williamson of data firm Markit flags up that France\u2019s growth rate is even weaker if government spending is stripped out: Germany needs to \u201ctake one for the team\u201d and boost its borrowing, rather than stick to balancing the books, reckons Danae Kyriakopoulou, economist at the CEBR: In such a loose monetary context today\u2019s figures are a great disappointment and highlight the need for fiscal expansion to support efforts on the monetary side. Given the periphery countries\u2019 struggle with fiscal consolidation (most are running high budget deficits and have little room to increase spending), this leaves Germany as the best-placed candidate to set the fiscal motors in motion. It is thus time for Germany to reconsider its pledge to run a balanced budget next year and \u201ctake one for the Eurozone team\u201d. Given its own recent weakness a move towards fiscal expansion will likely help its own economy along the way, too. This handy chart from the FT shows how Greece grew faster than Germany in the last quarter: The eurozone countries who have implemented structural reforms are now enjoying economic growth, points out Bill Adams, senior international economist for PNC Financial Services Group: While Germany is slowing, France is slow, and Italy is still mired in recession, the crisis economies that aggressively reformed their labor markets are now seeing better growth than the Eurozone average: Portugal grew 1.0%t from a year earlier in the third quarter, Spain 1.6%, and Greece 1.4%. Ireland\u2019s third quarter real GDP growth was not released in today\u2019s Eurostat report, but after very robust growth in the second quarter (6.5% in year-ago terms) it is surely also outpacing the Eurozone average. Labour market reforms are paying off, Adams reckons: There was a long and acrimonious debate during the depths of the euro crisis about whether painful labor market reforms stimulate growth. Labor market reforms are often lumped in with austerity, since both are highly unpopular, but they analytically quite different - Italy, for example, has chosen more austerity than labor reform, and suffering the consequences. Clearly labor reforms didn\u2019t boost growth in the short run, but two to three years after the most turbulent period of the crisis, the countries that swallowed that bitter medicine are seeing growth dividends. Richard Grieveson of the Economist Intelligence Unit is worried that Germany performed so badly in the third quarter, with growth of just 0.1%. \u201cDeclining investment growth in the third quarter is a particular concern, both for Germany and the euro zone more broadly. \u201cThe outlook remains week. Overall the main impediments to German growth\u2014structural weakness in other key euro zone markets, tensions with Russia and a lack of political will to invest\u2014remain in play, and are unlikely to change in the coming quarter.\u201d Peter Vanden Houte of ING point out that the eurozone has still not recovered all the output lost since the financial crisis began: Before getting overexcited by the slightly better than expected growth figure, one should bear in mind that the current growth pace is only about half the potential growth rate and that the Eurozone\u2019s GDP is still more than 2% below its level at the start of 2008. Not exactly an economic boom. Reaction to today\u2019s growth figures is flooding in, so I\u2019ll mop up the best: Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, says investors will take a little comfort, but no more: \u201cOn their own, these growth figures are nothing to write home about, but in the context of the negative news emerging from the eurozone in recent months, the simple fact that growth isn\u2019t slowing will reassure investors. But let\u2019s be clear, the outlook for the Eurozone is still heavily clouded. Inflation remains in the doldrums, employment across the bloc is not improving, and manufacturing is in a state of near stagnation. What have we learned this morning? The eurozone has posted another quarter of unimpressive growth, with GDP up just 0.2% over the summer. (rolling coverage starts here) Greece is no longer in recession - indeed, it grew faster than any other euro member in the last quarter (although Ireland, for example, hasn\u2019t reported yet). Germany has dodged recession too (details), but Italy was less fortunate (details). France grew a little faster than expected, but thanks to government spending rather than trade and investment (details) And economists remain concerned that the euro economy is struggling, and needs bolder reforms. Here\u2019s how the main European economies fared in the last three months: Germany: +0.1% quarter-on-quarter France: + 0.3% q/q Spain: + 0.5% q/q Italy: -0.1% q/q Portugal: +0.2% q/q The Netherlands: +0.2% q/q Greece: +0.7% q/q UK: + 0.7% q/q Poland: +0.9% q/q The eurozone: +0.2% q/q The EU: +0.3% q/q Eurostat\u2019s full report is here. Cyprus\u2019s recession continued, with GDP falling by 0.4% in the last three months. That means only it, and Italy, shrank in July-September This chart, of GDP compared to a year ago, shows the long depths of Greece\u2019s recession: It appears that Greece actually exited recession in the first three months of 2014. The data just released by Eurostat shows that the Greek economy grew by 0.8% in January-March, and by another 0.3% in April-June, before posting 0.7% growth in the third quarter. Today\u2019s numbers include recent revisions to the way eurozone data is calculated. And we don\u2019t normally get quarterly GDP figures for Greece - this is a welcome change. At long, long last, Greece\u2019s recession has ended, after almost six years of misery. Greek GDP rose by 0.7% in the third quarter of 2014, according to figures just released by Eurostat. That ends a slump that began in autumn 2008, as the financial crisis was at its height and the pillars of the economic system were wobbling. A series of austerity packages have wiped around a fifth off Greece\u2019s economy since. Eurostat also reports that Greek GDP is up by 1.7% over the last 12 months. The Greek Recovery has finally started.... Breaking: The eurozone grew by 0.2% in the third quarter of 2014. That\u2019s according to Eurostat, based on the various growth figures released by member states (our rolling coverage starts at 6.30am GMT). Slightly better than some economists had expected. So, another quarter of limp growth that won\u2019t do enough to drag down Europe\u2019s painfully high unemployment rates. Reaction to follow.... No City economist surveyed by Bloomberg expected Italy to grow in the last quarter. Many expected a deeper downturn. Europe\u2019s economy is basically stagnating, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. He reckons today\u2019s growth figures do little to assuage concerns about the region\u2019s outlook. Outside of Spain, the Eurozone economy is flatlining, with the risk of a renewed recessionary lurch not to be underestimated. And leaders, not central bankers, need to act, he adds: Still the fact remains that it is the very disparate collective of national governments that \u201cneed to act\u201d rather than the ECB, which will effect no change to that outlook whatever it does as long as politicians do not co-operate. Incidentally, we already know that Spain grew by 0.5% in the third quarter. That data, released last month, means that the Spanish economy was the best performing Big Four euro economy. And not far behind the UK. Economists has expected Portugal to grow by 0.4%, though.... Portugal\u2019s economy has racked up another quarter of growth, with GDP rising by 0.2% between July and September. Twice as fast as Germany! IMF chief Christine Lagarde has told the BBC that European leaders must do more to create jobs. Poland\u2019s economy outperformed the eurozone in the last quarter - with growth of 0.9%. Its economy is 3.3% larger than a year ago, beating forecasts. Italy\u2019s economy has now either shrunk, or been flat, for the last 13 quarters in a row! It began contracting in the third quarter of 2011, and the recession didn\u2019t stop until the third quarter of 2013, when GDP stagnated. Italy then shrank a little in Q4 2013, was flat in Q1 2014, and has now shrunk in Q2 and Q3. This chart from ISTAT tell the story: More details here Breaking: Italy has fallen back into recession, as its economic malaise continues. Italian GDP fell by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2014, broadly as expected. That follows a 0.2% contraction in the second quarter of 2014, which means prime minister Matteo Renzi has a technical recession on its hands. (GDP was flat in the first three months of 2014). Italian GDP has fallen by 0.4% over the last year. Coming up, Italy\u2019s GDP.... The French CAC stock index has risen by 0.4% in early trading, as traders welcome the news that its economy grew by 0.3% last quarter. Germany\u2019s DAX is up by 0.2% following the news that Germany avoided recession. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets says the growth data is \u201cproviding some relief regarding the woes of the struggling region\u201d. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our early story explaining today\u2019s eurozone growth data: Eurozone growth figures: Germany avoids triple-dip recession Another picture of Angela Merkel in New Zealand, this time charming a kiwi. Just realised that the Dutch growth rate in the second quarter of 2014 has been revised down, to 0.6% from 0.7% originally. Just in: the Netherlands economy slowed in the last three months. Dutch GDP rose by just 0.2% in the July-September quarter, down from 0.6% growth between April and June. Angela Merkel will have learned that Germany avoided recession during a trip to New Zealand: The Slovak economy grew faster than expected - with GDP expanding by 0.6% during the quarter. More GDP figures.... Hungary grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, matching the growth recorded in April-June. On an annual basis, GDP rose by 3.2%, down from 3.9% three months ago. The country\u2019s statistics body said there was a slowdown in the auto industry and in construction. Britain\u2019s government will be relieved that Germany has avoided recession (details start here), says Ed Conway of Sky News: He writes: If there is one person who will almost as delighted as Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, that the euro area\u2019s two biggest economies are not in recession, it is George Osborne. The last thing he needed ahead of a testy election campaign was a serious UK slowdown caused by factors entirely beyond his control. But.... The fact remains that however much Britain increases its exports outside the EU, its economic fate will still be inextricably tied to that of the euro area. And while the prognosis looks a touch brighter today, the long term outlook is hardly brilliant. And the excellent George Magnus, UBS\u2019s former chief economist, is equally downbeat: Kit Juckes, top currency analyst at Societe Generale, points out that the eurozone economy is still weak and troubling: The underlying story, which is going to be with us for a long time, is of stagnation and of hopes of recovery repeatedly being dashed unless someone gets some policy-making heads and knocks them together. Europe is experiencing a \u201cWaterworld recovery\u201d, says Alberto Gallo of RBS, and time is running out. Speaking on Bloomberg now, Gallo\u2019s explaining that it is a mistake to rely on liquidity from central banks to stimulate growth, rather than making structural economic reforms. He warns that this can\u2019t go on much longer, as inflation - and inflation expectations - are falling. We are getting close to Japanification here, there\u2019s not a lot of time left. The Czech Republic has missed expectations, growing by 0.3% during the third quarter. That won\u2019t affect the eurozone growth figures, though, as the Czechs (like Romania) aren\u2019t in the euro. Romania\u2019s economy grew by a healthy 1.9% in the third quarter of 2014, its statistics body just reported. That means it has expanded by 3.2% over the last year. The euro has dipped in early trading against the US dollar, to $1.245. We\u2019re about to get another splurge of GDP data from smaller European countries, including Austria, Hungary, Romania and the Slovak and Czech Republics. So why did Germany\u2019s economy grow so weakly last quarter? ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski has a few theories; including problems in major trading partners including China, France and Italy; and the Ukraine crisis which has hurt trade with Russia and dented business confidence. But he also argues that \u201cvirtuous circle is coming to an end\u201d. The resilience of the labour market against the slowdown might not only be a sign of strength but also simply the last stage of Germany\u2019s reform super cycle, which started more than ten years ago. The French government has received today\u2019s GDP figures cautiously, even though growth was a little stronger than expected last quarter. France\u2019s finance minister Michel Sapin has pointed out that growth of 0.3% isn\u2019t enough to fix the country\u2019s jobs crisis: \u201cEconomic activity has picked up slightly but remains too weak to ensure the job creation our country needs.\u201d ING analyst Julien Manceeaux isn\u2019t too impressed by this morning\u2019s French GDP report. He\u2019s disappointed that growth in the second quarter was revised down to minus 0.1%. Figures published this morning first showed that GDP growth in Q2 has been revised downwards to -0.1% after 0,0% in Q1. This makes the small rebound [+0.3%] announced for Q3 a rather weak one, especially as it was mainly driven by stock accumulation and public spending. The shine has been knocked off Germany\u2019s second economic miracle, says Carsten Brzeski of ING. He writes: Almost all the glamour of the second German Wirtschaftswunder seems to be gone. Chances are high that after the release of the Eurozone data at 11am CET, today\u2019s data mark the first time the German economy underperformed the rest of the Eurozone in two consecutive quarters since the doomy days of the crisis in late 2008 and early 2009. Brzeski adds that the German economy has grown by an average of 0.2% QoQ each quarter since early 2013: This makes the Eurozone\u2019s powerhouse rather a one-eyed king in the land of the blind than an economic superman. ABM Amro\u2019s Nick Kounis has stuck his neck out, and predicted that the eurozone grew by 0.2% in the third quarter of 2014. We get the overall eurozone growth figure at 10am GMT. \u201cThe German economy turned out to be stable in a difficult global economic environment,\u201d says its Statistics Office. And the details of today\u2019s GDP report show that consumer spending and trade are responsible for the 0.1% growth. But (as with France) business capital investment fell during the last quarter, suggesting firms may have been spooked by the weak eurozone economy and the Ukraine crisis. Destatis says: Positive contributions were made mainly by households, which considerably increased their final consumption expenditure in the third quarter of 2014, according to provisional calculations. Foreign trade also supported the German economy. The increase in exports was higher than that of imports. Consequently, the balance of exports and imports had a slightly positive effect on the GDP in a quarter-on-quarter comparison. By contrast, total gross fixed capital formation decreased. Here\u2019s the full report. Some perspective from Bloomberg\u2019s Jonathan Ferro -- Germany\u2019s 0.1% growth is welcome, but it\u2019s hardly a blast. Germany\u2019s second-quarter GDP has also been revised upwards, to show a -0.1% contraction rather than the -0.2% first estimated. The news that Germany has narrowly avoided a recession will sent relief through the global economy. It also takes a little pressure off the European Central Bank to consider additional stimulus measures to stimulate the euro economy. Breaking: Germany has avoided recession, JUST. German GDP grew by a measly 0.1% in the third quarter of 2014, having contracted in the previous quarter. That\u2019s broadly in line with expectations, and means that Europe\u2019s largest economy has avoided the humiliation of a technical recession. So, a turnaround, but not a great performance. France\u2019s growth 0.3% in the last quarter was driven by household spending and government spending. Companies restocking their inventories also helped. But net trade, and capital investment (firms spending on new equipment etc), both fell again. Details: Households\u2019 consumption expenditure: up 0.2% General government expenditure: up by 0.8% Total gross fixed capital formation: down 0.6% Exports recovered, by 0.5%, while imports rose by 1.1%. That means that foreign trade made a negative contribution to GDP -- 0.2% Inventory building added 0.3% to GDP France\u2019s GDP report is online here. Nick Kounis of ABN Amro confirms that French growth has beaten forecasts -- that\u2019s a phrase I\u2019ve not been able to write often, recently. 17 minutes until we get Germany..... Frederik Ducrozet of Credit Agricole is excited that the curve of French GDP curve has been reversed. France\u2019s 0.3% growth in the third quarter of 2014 is the strongest performance since 2011, says Mark Barton on Bloomberg TV. He adds: That shows you the state that the French economy has been in for the last four years. Here we go! France\u2019s economy faster than economists expected in the third quarter of 2014. GDP rose by 0.3% in the July-September quarter, beating expectations. That\u2019s a rare piece of good news for president Hollande. However, it\u2019s not ALL good news. The GDP for the second quarter has been revised down, from 0% to minus 0.1%. Still, a decent start to GDP Day. Reaction to follow.... Good morning. It\u2019s time to discover how the eurozone economy performed in the third quarter of 2014, and the results may not be pretty. Over the next few hours, GDP data from across the single currency will be released by national statistics bodies. This data will then show how well, or badly, the region performed. Economists believe the data will confirm the eurozone economy struggled over the summer, with domestic weakness and geopolitical crises overseas hitting growth. The big question is, how badly did Germany do? It\u2019s economy shrank in the second quarter of this year - another contraction would mean a technical recession. Here\u2019s the order of business: France: 6.30am GMT (7.30am CET) German: 7am GMT Austria, The Slovak and Czech Republics, Hungary and Romania: 8am GMT The Netherlands. 8.30am GMT Italy: 9am GMT The whole eurozone 10am, along with the eurozone inflation figure for October A poor morning\u2019s results will put more pressure on the ECB to take unconventional actions to stimulate the eurozone.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Bill Gross reportedly earns $290m bonus even as investors withdrew billions from Pimco funds", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former Pimco star fund manager Bill Gross earned $290m last year, while the firm\u2019s other 59 managing directors split a bonus pool of $1.2bn among them, according to a disputed news report. Bloomberg columnist Barry Ritholtz reported the numbers, which he wrote were \u201cbased on news reports, public records and new data\u201d. According to the report, Pimco\u2019s current chief investment officer, Daniel Ivascyn, received a bonus of $70m while the global head of product management, Wendy Cupps, got $50m. The CEO, Douglas Hodge, reportedly earned $45m. Pimco\u2019s compensation has long been a closely guarded secret, an irony as the firm\u2019s ugly politics have often played out in the open. Pimco disputed the numbers in a statement: \u201cWhile Pimco does not comment on compensation, the figures provided to Bloomberg are not correct. For more than three decades, Pimco\u2019s managing directors have maintained a substantial interest in the firm, currently 30% of profits and this provides an important means to attract and retain the best investment talent to serve our clients.\u201d Wall Street compensation consultant Alan Johnson, of Johnson Associates, called the estimate of Gross\u2019s bonus package, if true, \u201ca very generous arrangement\u201d. A superstar money manager working for a major corporation would, in a good year, earn about $25m to $30m, Johnson said \u2013 a tenth of what Gross earned. Hedge-fund managers, who are a slightly different breed, earn much more because their firms frequently have no public shareholders. Hedge fund managers take their compensation as a percentage of the money they manage and the returns they deliver. One of the highest-paid hedge-fund managers is Steve Cohen, of the former SAC Capital, whose bonus and salary reportedly totaled $2.3bn in 2013. Johnson said the last time a corporate money manager earned a salary the reported size of Gross\u2019s pay was in the 1980s when \u201cjunk bond king\u201d Michael Milken reigned at Drexel Burnham Lambert. In 1987 alone, Milken made $500m, not adjusted for inflation, according to the New York Times. As with Milken, Gross\u2019s high pay is widely attributed to the fact that he built the business. (Gross\u2019s nickname, similarly, is \u201cthe bond king\u201d and he has called himself \u201cthe Justin Bieber of bonds\u201d.) Gross founded Pimco and he has openly said to his coworkers that the firm wouldn\u2019t have accumulated $2tn in assets without his name and reputation. Over the lifetime of his Total Return Fund, he generated about an 8% return for his investors each year. However, Gross has struggled to turn in decent returns to his investors for the past few years, creating a significant rift between his pay and his performance. In 2011, his Pimco Total Return Fund lagged behind a major bond index by nearly 4% \u2013 a giant rift. The past two years of returns, similarly, were characterized by significant outflows as investors withdrew their money. Gross\u2019s pay \u201cwas a reflection of the business arrangement in the past, not of his current value,\u201d said Johnson. It\u2019s rare for corporate money management firms to pay such high salaries, primarily because many of them have to answer to shareholders. Pimco is owned by the giant German insurer Allianz, which has been defending the subsidiary all year. Gross\u2019s time at Pimco was characterized by frequent conflicts with his co-workers and eccentric behavior including, reportedly, banning anyone from talking to him in the mornings. He was known for his confrontational, brash style, once reportedly challenging his co-CEO by asking, \u201cI have a 41-year track record of investing excellence. What do you have?\u201d and declaring \u201cI\u2019m tired of cleaning up your shit.\u201d \u201cThey were known for being high payers, and [these bonuses] may explain why many of them stayed for so long, because if they were unhappy under his tutelage, they didn\u2019t want to leave,\u201d Johnson said. At Allianz\u2019s annual meeting in May, the CEO, Michael Diekmann, mounted a spirited defense of Pimco after Mohamed El-Erian left. \u201cWe have more than earned back all the expenses spent on the purchase of Pimco over the past few years,\u201d Diekmann told shareholders. He said that last year, Pimco made a \u201csignificant contribution\u201d to Allianz\u2019s earnings. \u201cWe very rarely in business have a numerical measure of how important you are,\u201d Johnson said. \u201c[Gross] went to Janus and none of the [investor] money followed. So at some point he stopped being as important as he thought he was.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The former Pimco star fund manager Bill Gross earned $290m last year, while the firm\u2019s other 59 managing directors split a bonus pool of $1.2bn among them, according to a disputed news report. <br></p> <p>Bloomberg columnist Barry Ritholtz reported the numbers, which he wrote were \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-11-14/guess-how-much-money-bill-gross-made-last-year\">based on news reports, public records and new data</a>\u201d.</p> <p>According to the report, Pimco\u2019s current chief investment officer, Daniel Ivascyn, received a bonus of $70m while the global head of product management, Wendy Cupps, got $50m. The CEO, Douglas Hodge, reportedly earned $45m.</p> <p>Pimco\u2019s compensation has long been a closely guarded secret, an irony as the firm\u2019s ugly politics have often played out in the open. <br></p> <p>Pimco disputed the numbers in a statement: \u201cWhile Pimco does not comment on compensation, the figures provided to Bloomberg are not correct. For more than three decades, Pimco\u2019s managing directors have maintained a substantial interest in the firm, currently 30% of profits and this provides an important means to attract and retain the best investment talent to serve our clients.\u201d</p> <p>Wall Street compensation consultant Alan Johnson, of Johnson Associates, called the estimate of Gross\u2019s bonus package, if true, \u201ca very generous arrangement\u201d.</p> <p>A superstar money manager working for a major corporation would, in a good year, earn about $25m to $30m, Johnson said \u2013 a tenth of what Gross earned. <br></p> <p>Hedge-fund managers, who are a slightly different breed, earn much more because their firms frequently have no public shareholders. Hedge fund managers take their compensation as a percentage of the money they manage and the returns they deliver. One of the highest-paid hedge-fund managers is Steve Cohen, of the former SAC Capital, whose bonus and salary reportedly totaled $2.3bn in 2013. <br></p> <p>Johnson said the last time a corporate money manager earned a salary the reported size of Gross\u2019s pay was in the 1980s when \u201cjunk bond king\u201d Michael Milken reigned at Drexel Burnham Lambert. In 1987 alone, Milken <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/03/business/wages-even-wall-st-can-t-stomach.html\">made $500m</a>, not adjusted for inflation, according to the New York Times.<br></p> <p>As with Milken, Gross\u2019s high pay is widely attributed to the fact that he built the business. (Gross\u2019s nickname, similarly, is \u201cthe bond king\u201d and he has called himself \u201cthe Justin Bieber of bonds\u201d.) Gross founded Pimco and he has openly said to his coworkers that the firm wouldn\u2019t have accumulated $2tn in assets without his name and reputation. Over the lifetime of his Total Return Fund, he generated about an 8% return for his investors each year. <br></p> <p>However, Gross has struggled to turn in decent returns to his investors for the past few years, creating a significant rift between his pay and his performance. In 2011, his Pimco Total Return Fund lagged behind a major bond index by nearly 4% \u2013 a giant rift. The past two years of returns, similarly, were characterized by significant outflows as investors withdrew their money.</p> <p>Gross\u2019s pay \u201cwas a reflection of the business arrangement in the past, not of his current value,\u201d said Johnson. <br></p> <p>It\u2019s rare for corporate money management firms to pay such high salaries, primarily because many of them have to answer to shareholders. Pimco is owned by the giant German insurer Allianz, which has been defending the subsidiary all year.</p> <p>Gross\u2019s time at Pimco was characterized by frequent conflicts with his co-workers and eccentric behavior including, reportedly, banning anyone from talking to him in the mornings. <br></p> <p>He was known for his confrontational, brash style, once reportedly challenging his co-CEO by asking, \u201cI have a 41-year track record of investing excellence. What do <em>you</em> have?\u201d and declaring \u201cI\u2019m tired of cleaning up your shit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were known for being high payers, and [these bonuses] may explain why many of them stayed for so long, because if they were unhappy under his tutelage, they didn\u2019t want to leave,\u201d Johnson said. <br></p> <p>At Allianz\u2019s annual meeting in May, the CEO, Michael Diekmann, mounted a spirited defense of Pimco after Mohamed El-Erian left. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe have more than earned back all the expenses spent on the purchase of Pimco over the past few years,\u201d Diekmann told shareholders. He said that last year, Pimco made a \u201csignificant contribution\u201d to Allianz\u2019s earnings. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe very rarely in business have a numerical measure of how important you are,\u201d Johnson said. \u201c[Gross] went to Janus and none of the [investor] money followed. So at some point he stopped being as important as he thought he was.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A surge in public sector housebuilding helped the construction sector return to health in September, according to official figures. Housing Associations and other publicly funded bodies reported their biggest monthly jump in building activity since 1997. Alongside an increase in factory and infrastructure building, that helped boost the construction sector to a 1.8% rise in output during September, after a 3.0% decline in August. Annual growth reached 3.5%. The Office for National Statistics said a strong flow of housebuilding over the last year was single biggest factor in revitalising the sector, after a 22.3% increase in activity since September 2013. Analysts said the buoyant September showed that August had been a blip in an otherwise consistent pattern of growth that should maintain the industry\u2019s momentum for the rest of the year. However, slowing growth in private housebuilding and cuts in spending on repairs and maintenance appeared to reflect the broader slowdown in activity across the economy. Housebuilders are enjoying bumper profits after two years of rising home completions and soaring prices, but have become more dependent on public sector funds as private developers take a more conservative view of future work and restrict the flow of land for building. Reflecting the industry\u2019s delayed recovery from the financial crisis, the ONS said output has increased by 9.2% since the crash but still remains 8.2% below the level in the first three months of 2008. Chris Williamson, chief UK economist at financial data provider Markit, said: \u201cAfter alarm bells were rung in the UK construction sector in August, when output fell dramatically, the sector staged a partial recovery in September to record healthy growth over the third quarter as a whole \u201cHowever, looking forward, the sector is likely to see the rate of expansion continue to cool as the UK moves towards the end of the year and into 2015. \u201cThe housing market has slowed since earlier in the year, most likely due to a combination of factors which include the tightening of lending rules introduced in the Mortgage Market Review, homebuyers\u2019 worries about future interest rate hikes and house prices simply being historically high. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the residential property market that is cooling. Growth of commercial property development has also slowed since earlier in the year, according to data compiled by Markit and Savills, which adds to the sense that the economy as a whole is moving down a gear in the second half of 2014. \u201cAt the moment, however, any slowing merely looks to be a moderation from historically higher rates of growth earlier in the year, and will pose little concern to policymakers.\u201d",

GDP fell by 0.1% in Q3 following a 0.2% decline in Q2. This means it has now officially entered its third recession since 2008. For governments that think that the ECB\u2019s conservativeness is at the heart of the eurozone\u2019s problems, the comparison between Italy, on the one hand, and Spain and Greece is telling. Spain and Greece have done more in terms of structural reforms, and have also seen sharp falls in wages. This internal devaluation has restored competitiveness back close to the start of the euro levels. In Italy wages have remained extremely elevated. </p> <p>We expect eurozone economic growth to slowly improve in the coming quarters on the back of the decline in the euro, the fall in oil prices, easing bank lending and other financial conditions and the upswing in US demand.<br></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Danae Kyriakopoulou of the </strong><strong>Centre for Economics and Business Research</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Economic output in the Eurozone expanded by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 2014, according to data released by Eurostat this morning. Germany and France, the currency bloc\u2019s two biggest economies, surprised on the upside: the German economy managed to avoid recession, growing by 0.1% and beating economists\u2019 consensus expectation for a 0.1% decline. The surprise was even more positive for France, whose economy expanded by 0.3% again beating expectations for a 0.1% decline. Meanwhile, the Italian economy contracted by 0.1%.</p> <p>The fact that such weak growth rates are a cause for cheer is worrying in itself. After a false dawn when the Eurozone exited recession just over a year ago the fundamentals and overall economic picture have failed to see a substantial improvement.<br></p> <p>Digging below the headline number for overall economic expansion the picture in Germany is highly worrying: German exports fell by 5.8% from July to August while industrial production saw its biggest decline since 2009 over the same period, contracting by 4.8%. Much of this is due to a slowdown in some of Germany\u2019s key trading partners, notably China and other emerging markets, Ukraine and Russia, as well as the rest of the Eurozone. In other words, the German economy is starting to feel the pain of the austerity policies that it so fiercely advocated elsewhere in the Eurozone. As a capital goods exporter, Germany had been one of the prime beneficiaries of credit-driven demand in China but this is now also reversing: falling property prices and credit growth are bringing forward China\u2019s choice between a slowdown towards a more sustainable growth trajectory and a continued credit-fuelled but unsustainable expansion. The recent rhetoric from Beijing points to a commitment to the former, and this is likely to suppress Germany at least in the short term.<br></p> <p>This all suggests that despite the headline news of an acceleration in growth this quarter the overall picture in the currency bloc remains bleak. The European Central Bank is already doing \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to keep the Eurozone ship afloat: interest rates have been lowered to negative territory (the first time this has been done by a major central bank), and additional measures such as longer-term refinancing operation schemes (TLTROs) and an asset-backed securities (ABS) purchasing programme are in effect. The ECB President Mario Draghi recently also reiterated the governing council\u2019s unanimous commitment to consider yet more unconventional measures.</p> <p>In such a loose monetary context today\u2019s figures are a great disappointment and highlight the need for fiscal expansion to support efforts on the monetary side. Given the periphery countries\u2019 struggle with fiscal consolidation (most are running high budget deficits and have little room to increase spending), this leaves Germany as the best-placed candidate to set the fiscal motors in motion. It is thus time for Germany to reconsider its pledge to run a balanced budget next year and \u201ctake one for the Eurozone team\u201d. Given its own recent weakness a move towards fiscal expansion will likely help its own economy along the way, too.<br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2de92d1e8e4e6a8415344a023c32087b1908815e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/14/1415970223861/20d32950-6dc4-4873-8609-c0fd7276e32e-460x359.png\" alt=\"Eurozone GDP data\" width=\"460\" height=\"359\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CEBR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Chris Williamson of Markit:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe Eurozone enjoyed stronger than expected economic growth in the third quarter, providing welcome news that fears of a renewed recession look exaggerated. However, the data will diminish hopes that the ECB will feel the need to take further action to stimulate growth.</p> <p>\u201cOfficial data from Eurostat showed gross domestic product rose by 0.2% in the three months to September. The region is also now estimated to have grown 0.1% in the second quarter rather than stagnating, as previously estimated.</p> <p>\u201cThe official data confirm business survey data which show the Eurozone economy struggling to expand in the face of numerous headwinds but nevertheless managing to eke out modest growth and avoid recession. High levels of unemployment continue to hold back consumer spending, while business in the core countries of France and Germany continue to cut back on investment in a sign of increased economic uncertainty and widespread pessimism about the outlook.</p> <p>\u201cThe surveys point to further malaise extending into the fourth quarter, adding to the impression that there are few signs of the region pulling out of this torpor. The headline Markit Eurozone PMI recorded 52.1 in October, down slightly from an average of 52.8 in the third quarter and running at a level signalling another modest 0.2% expansion of GDP in the fourth quarter.</p> <p>\u201cPolicymakers will at least be reassured that fears of a renewed recession look overplayed, for the time being at least. The better than expected GDP reading (analysts were on average anticipating a mere 0.1% rise) means ECB looks even less likely to announce any further measures to boost growth until it can assess the impact of the additional \u20ac1 trillion of liquidity it already plans to inject into the economy.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>Germany skirted recession by the narrowest of margins, with GDP rising 0.1% in the three months to September after a 0.1% decline in the second quarter (which was revised up from a 0.2%.contraction). The stagnation seen over the past two quarters as a whole is a major concern, especially after Germany provided such a strong contribution to growth in the region at the start of the year. GDP had surged by 0.8% in the first quarter. Both households and exporters helped boost the German economy in the third quarter, but capital expenditure suffered a worryingly sharp decline.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>France reported 0.3% growth of GDP, likewise rebounding from a 0.1% decline in the second quarter to thereby avoid falling back into a technical recession. France\u2019s performance was flattered, however, by a 0.8% jump in government spending, the largest rise since the second quarter of last year. Once a 0.3% contribution from inventories to GDP in the third quarter is also taken into account, the French economy\u2019s performance suddenly looks a lot worse than indicated by the headline GDP number. As in Germany, a sharp decline in capital expenditure also raises worries about business confidence and points to weak future growth.</p> <p>\u201cSigns of growth reviving in some peripheral countries was confirmed, with Spain\u2019s economy growing by 0.5% and Greece by 0.7%. Italy, however, suffered a 0.1% drop in GDP as its slid back into its third recession since the financial crisis struck.</p> <p>\u201cIn other countries, the Netherlands and Belgium GDP growth came out in line with the euro area average of 0.2% but Austria\u2019s economy was stagnant.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9f7c0ea400b80126974cc21ede8b850660907bb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/14/1415971233208/1ffc45e0-46ac-41bc-b4fa-61531ea1760e-460x303.png\" alt=\"Eurozone GDP vs PMI\" width=\"460\" height=\"303\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eurozone GDP vs PMI</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Andy Scott, associate director at HiFX</strong><strong> <br></strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe news that the Eurozone\u2019s economy is performing marginally better than expected in the third quarter, gives hope that the future is looking bright for the single currency bloc. After all, the ECB has cut lending rates to almost zero - making it cheaper than ever to borrow money - as well as cutting deposit rates to a negative, effectively charging banks to hold on to excess money. It is also engaged in a Q.E. \u2018light\u2019 programme to increase the availability of cash that banks and financial companies have to lend. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, it\u2019s important to consider the bigger picture and when you do, it\u2019s clear that the future appears to be rather gloomy still. Unemployment remains incredibly high for a group of mostly developed economies at 11.5% and though it dropped at the end of last year and the start of this year, it hasn\u2019t fallen since May.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Bill Adams</strong><strong>, senior international economist for PNC Financial Services Group</strong>. </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Real GDP growth in the Eurozone picked up to 0.2% in non-annualized quarter over quarter terms in the third quarter of 2014; growth in the second quarter was revised up to 0.1% from 0.0% in the previous release. France expanded 0.3% from a quarter earlier in the third quarter, and Germany 0.1%. Italy shrank again in the third quarter, with real GDP down 0.1%.</p> <p>From a year earlier, real GDP in the Eurozone grew 0.8 percent in the third quarter, unchanged from a quarter earlier. While Germany is slowing, France is slow, and Italy is still mired in recession, the crisis economies that aggressively reformed their labor markets are now seeing better growth than the Eurozone average: Portugal grew 1.0% from a year earlier in the third quarter, Spain 1.6%, and Greece 1.4%. Ireland\u2019s third quarter real GDP growth was not released in today\u2019s Eurostat report, but after very robust growth in the second quarter (6.5% in year-ago terms) it is surely also outpacing the Eurozone average.</p> <p>There was a long and acrimonious debate during the depths of the euro crisis about whether painful labor market reforms stimulate growth. Labor market reforms are often lumped in with austerity, since both are highly unpopular, but they analytically quite different - Italy, for example, has chosen more austerity than labor reform, and suffering the consequences. Clearly labor reforms didn\u2019t boost growth in the short run, but two to three years after the most turbulent period of the crisis, the countries that swallowed that bitter medicine are seeing growth dividends. The third quarter GDP report will surely be cited in German arguments that labor market reforms are even more important than cutting deficits.</p> <p>The third quarter real GDP report is highly encouraging, and should silence the talk of a triple-dip recession for the euro area. But actually, the trend is mostly unchanged. Growth is modest and trending under 1.0 percent, not enough to bring the unemployment rate in the Eurozone back to normal anytime soon. For monetary policy, this weak growth is, while better than recession, insufficient to raise CPI inflation back to the ECB\u2019s below-but-close-to-2.0 percent target. An okay GDP report buys the ECB some time to wait and see how effective its asset purchase programs currently underway will be, instead of moving rapidly into government bond purchases.</p> </blockquote>",

We expect eurozone economic growth to slowly improve in the coming quarters on the back of the decline in the euro, the fall in oil prices, easing bank lending and other financial conditions and the upswing in US demand. Danae Kyriakopoulou of the Centre for Economics and Business Research Economic output in the Eurozone expanded by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 2014, according to data released by Eurostat this morning. Germany and France, the currency bloc\u2019s two biggest economies, surprised on the upside: the German economy managed to avoid recession, growing by 0.1% and beating economists\u2019 consensus expectation for a 0.1% decline. The surprise was even more positive for France, whose economy expanded by 0.3% again beating expectations for a 0.1% decline. Meanwhile, the Italian economy contracted by 0.1%. The fact that such weak growth rates are a cause for cheer is worrying in itself. After a false dawn when the Eurozone exited recession just over a year ago the fundamentals and overall economic picture have failed to see a substantial improvement. Digging below the headline number for overall economic expansion the picture in Germany is highly worrying: German exports fell by 5.8% from July to August while industrial production saw its biggest decline since 2009 over the same period, contracting by 4.8%. Much of this is due to a slowdown in some of Germany\u2019s key trading partners, notably China and other emerging markets, Ukraine and Russia, as well as the rest of the Eurozone. In other words, the German economy is starting to feel the pain of the austerity policies that it so fiercely advocated elsewhere in the Eurozone. As a capital goods exporter, Germany had been one of the prime beneficiaries of credit-driven demand in China but this is now also reversing: falling property prices and credit growth are bringing forward China\u2019s choice between a slowdown towards a more sustainable growth trajectory and a continued credit-fuelled but unsustainable expansion. The recent rhetoric from Beijing points to a commitment to the former, and this is likely to suppress Germany at least in the short term. This all suggests that despite the headline news of an acceleration in growth this quarter the overall picture in the currency bloc remains bleak. The European Central Bank is already doing \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to keep the Eurozone ship afloat: interest rates have been lowered to negative territory (the first time this has been done by a major central bank), and additional measures such as longer-term refinancing operation schemes (TLTROs) and an asset-backed securities (ABS) purchasing programme are in effect. The ECB President Mario Draghi recently also reiterated the governing council\u2019s unanimous commitment to consider yet more unconventional measures. In such a loose monetary context today\u2019s figures are a great disappointment and highlight the need for fiscal expansion to support efforts on the monetary side. Given the periphery countries\u2019 struggle with fiscal consolidation (most are running high budget deficits and have little room to increase spending), this leaves Germany as the best-placed candidate to set the fiscal motors in motion. It is thus time for Germany to reconsider its pledge to run a balanced budget next year and \u201ctake one for the Eurozone team\u201d. Given its own recent weakness a move towards fiscal expansion will likely help its own economy along the way, too. Chris Williamson of Markit: \u201cThe Eurozone enjoyed stronger than expected economic growth in the third quarter, providing welcome news that fears of a renewed recession look exaggerated. However, the data will diminish hopes that the ECB will feel the need to take further action to stimulate growth. \u201cOfficial data from Eurostat showed gross domestic product rose by 0.2% in the three months to September. The region is also now estimated to have grown 0.1% in the second quarter rather than stagnating, as previously estimated. \u201cThe official data confirm business survey data which show the Eurozone economy struggling to expand in the face of numerous headwinds but nevertheless managing to eke out modest growth and avoid recession. High levels of unemployment continue to hold back consumer spending, while business in the core countries of France and Germany continue to cut back on investment in a sign of increased economic uncertainty and widespread pessimism about the outlook. \u201cThe surveys point to further malaise extending into the fourth quarter, adding to the impression that there are few signs of the region pulling out of this torpor. The headline Markit Eurozone PMI recorded 52.1 in October, down slightly from an average of 52.8 in the third quarter and running at a level signalling another modest 0.2% expansion of GDP in the fourth quarter. \u201cPolicymakers will at least be reassured that fears of a renewed recession look overplayed, for the time being at least. The better than expected GDP reading (analysts were on average anticipating a mere 0.1% rise) means ECB looks even less likely to announce any further measures to boost growth until it can assess the impact of the additional \u20ac1 trillion of liquidity it already plans to inject into the economy. \u201cGermany skirted recession by the narrowest of margins, with GDP rising 0.1% in the three months to September after a 0.1% decline in the second quarter (which was revised up from a 0.2%.contraction). The stagnation seen over the past two quarters as a whole is a major concern, especially after Germany provided such a strong contribution to growth in the region at the start of the year. GDP had surged by 0.8% in the first quarter. Both households and exporters helped boost the German economy in the third quarter, but capital expenditure suffered a worryingly sharp decline. \u201cFrance reported 0.3% growth of GDP, likewise rebounding from a 0.1% decline in the second quarter to thereby avoid falling back into a technical recession. France\u2019s performance was flattered, however, by a 0.8% jump in government spending, the largest rise since the second quarter of last year. Once a 0.3% contribution from inventories to GDP in the third quarter is also taken into account, the French economy\u2019s performance suddenly looks a lot worse than indicated by the headline GDP number. As in Germany, a sharp decline in capital expenditure also raises worries about business confidence and points to weak future growth. \u201cSigns of growth reviving in some peripheral countries was confirmed, with Spain\u2019s economy growing by 0.5% and Greece by 0.7%. Italy, however, suffered a 0.1% drop in GDP as its slid back into its third recession since the financial crisis struck. \u201cIn other countries, the Netherlands and Belgium GDP growth came out in line with the euro area average of 0.2% but Austria\u2019s economy was stagnant.\u201d Andy Scott, associate director at HiFX \u201cThe news that the Eurozone\u2019s economy is performing marginally better than expected in the third quarter, gives hope that the future is looking bright for the single currency bloc. After all, the ECB has cut lending rates to almost zero - making it cheaper than ever to borrow money - as well as cutting deposit rates to a negative, effectively charging banks to hold on to excess money. It is also engaged in a Q.E. \u2018light\u2019 programme to increase the availability of cash that banks and financial companies have to lend. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s important to consider the bigger picture and when you do, it\u2019s clear that the future appears to be rather gloomy still. Unemployment remains incredibly high for a group of mostly developed economies at 11.5% and though it dropped at the end of last year and the start of this year, it hasn\u2019t fallen since May. Bill Adams, senior international economist for PNC Financial Services Group. Real GDP growth in the Eurozone picked up to 0.2% in non-annualized quarter over quarter terms in the third quarter of 2014; growth in the second quarter was revised up to 0.1% from 0.0% in the previous release. France expanded 0.3% from a quarter earlier in the third quarter, and Germany 0.1%. Italy shrank again in the third quarter, with real GDP down 0.1%. From a year earlier, real GDP in the Eurozone grew 0.8 percent in the third quarter, unchanged from a quarter earlier. While Germany is slowing, France is slow, and Italy is still mired in recession, the crisis economies that aggressively reformed their labor markets are now seeing better growth than the Eurozone average: Portugal grew 1.0% from a year earlier in the third quarter, Spain 1.6%, and Greece 1.4%. Ireland\u2019s third quarter real GDP growth was not released in today\u2019s Eurostat report, but after very robust growth in the second quarter (6.5% in year-ago terms) it is surely also outpacing the Eurozone average. There was a long and acrimonious debate during the depths of the euro crisis about whether painful labor market reforms stimulate growth. Labor market reforms are often lumped in with austerity, since both are highly unpopular, but they analytically quite different - Italy, for example, has chosen more austerity than labor reform, and suffering the consequences. Clearly labor reforms didn\u2019t boost growth in the short run, but two to three years after the most turbulent period of the crisis, the countries that swallowed that bitter medicine are seeing growth dividends. The third quarter GDP report will surely be cited in German arguments that labor market reforms are even more important than cutting deficits. The third quarter real GDP report is highly encouraging, and should silence the talk of a triple-dip recession for the euro area. But actually, the trend is mostly unchanged. Growth is modest and trending under 1.0 percent, not enough to bring the unemployment rate in the Eurozone back to normal anytime soon. For monetary policy, this weak growth is, while better than recession, insufficient to raise CPI inflation back to the ECB\u2019s below-but-close-to-2.0 percent target. An okay GDP report buys the ECB some time to wait and see how effective its asset purchase programs currently underway will be, instead of moving rapidly into government bond purchases.",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Soames may be looking enviously at his previous employer Aggreko, given the problems he is facing at outsourcer Serco which he joined earlier this year. While Serco this week issued its fourth profit warning in a year and unveiled plans to tap shareholders for \u00a3550m, Aggreko seems to be chugging along nicely. The temporary power supply business is currently at the top of a weak FTSE 100, its shares climbing 49p or 3% to \u00a315.91 after it said trading was in line with expectations. The shares have however lost around 20% between August and October before recovery in November, and traders said part of the day\u2019s rise could be short sellers needing to cover their positions. According to Markit 6.5% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares are out on loan. In its update, the company said underlying revenue in the third quarter was up 6% although after currency movements, it fell 3%. Overall, despite an uncertain market environment, it said it expected underlying full year trading profits to be similar to 2013. Analysts mainly stuck with their hold recommendations. John Lawson at Investec said: Aggreko has delivered an in line statement that... highlights the issue that the group seems to have now, i.e. how to grow underlying earnings in a meaningful way. Of course, the cause of the subdued results is the ending of some large contracts (such the military work in the Middle East) and currency headwinds. That said, customers in Power Projects remain unwilling to commit to much new work (despite strong market demand drivers). Andrew Nussey at Peel Hunt said: Aggreko\u2019s statement confirms trading in line. However, we are mindful that the outlook for 2015 remains uncertain, given geopolitical risks and customer hesitancy. Aggreko continues to be a high quality proposition, but the shares, trading on 18 times December 2015, continue to reflect recovery potential. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 15.10 points at 6620.35, as the latest data from the eurozone showed a mixed picture for growth, with Italy falling into recession but Germany avoiding that ignominy. With metal prices falling again and oil still weak, commodity company shares are among the fallers. Fresnillo is down 16.5p at 709.5p and Anglo American is 25p lower at \u00a313.36. Tullow Oil has slipped 10.5p to 453.5p while BP has lost 5p to 424.95p. Among the mid-caps Premier Farnell has fallen 15.7p to 164.2p after the electronic component distributor said full year operating margins would be below previous levels after weaker trading conditions in Asia and Europe. But Dairy Crest has climbed 7.8p to 489.8p as Credit Suisse raised its recommendation from underperform to neutral and its target price from 390p to 485p after the company\u2019s plan to sell its dairies business.
