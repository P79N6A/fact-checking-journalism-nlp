      "bodyText": "UK retailers are gearing up for a US-style \u201cBlack Friday\u201d shopping frenzy, with experts predicting thousands of bargain hunters will descend on high streets in search of cut-price TVs, tablets and toys. The 24-hour sales bonanza imported from the US has become big business in the UK, with store bosses predicting that sales rung up on Friday will be double those of last year. Visa Europe expects spending of \u00a3518m on its cards. The unprecedented spending spree will kick-start Christmas shopping as some of the high street\u2019s biggest names including John Lewis, Asda, Currys and Argos launch thousands of deals online and in store. The discounts have been heavily publicised by retailers in the runup to Friday and many will be available online just after midnight. Some stores are also opening their doors to nighttime shoppers. Tesco\u2019s larger superstores are opening at a minute past midnight, while the entertainment retailer Game will invite shoppers in a minute before midnight for three hours of nocturnal shopping. All John Lewis stores will open at 8am but its flagship Oxford Street store in central London will trade until 10pm \u2013 the longest trading day in its 150-year history. Retail intelligence experts Springboard said the number of shoppers on UK high streets, shopping centres and retail parks will leap by nearly 10% on Friday and continue over the weekend, before Cyber Monday on 1 December, which is traditionally the biggest day of the year for online sales. Footfall on the streets on Monday is also expected to edge up, driven primarily by the surging popularity of \u201cclick and collect\u201d services, used by 90% of online shoppers. Diane Wehrle, retail director at Springboard, said: \u201cLast year we saw a marked increase in shopping footfall due to Black Friday coming just after the last payday. This year, the timing is just as good for retailers but this November it comes during a period of even better consumer confidence.\u201d Black Friday, which follows the Thanksgiving holiday, is a massive sales tradition in the US . It was said to be the day that American retailers began earning profits each year, crossing from the red into the black. In 2010 Amazon introduced Black Friday discounts to Britain and last year other high street retailers followed suit. This year, the phenomenon has engulfed the whole sector, with Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Marks and Spencer among those looking for a slice of what has in effect become the new Boxing Day sales. Walmart-owned Asda has doubled its Black Friday range, boosting the number of products on offer from half a million to 700,000 and rolling the event out to 100 more stores across the country \u2013 a total of 441. Its bargains will include 40-in LED TVs at just \u00a3139. Last year it was caught out by the frenzied response to offers such as cut-price 60-in TVs, with the day overshadowed by fights among shoppers scrabbling for a finite amount of stock. John Roberts of the white goods and electricals discount chain AO.com, said: \u201cWe think this Friday will be the single biggest day of sales of the year.\u201d More retailers were taking part as many Britons were still spending carefully and stores bosses knew it was an opportunity they could not miss. If you are trying to sell stuff four days after Black Friday a lot of consumers will have already bought it.\u201d Staff at Amazon have been working flat out in its UK warehouses as orders pour in during its Black Friday deals week to its Peterborough fulfilment centre in Cambridgeshire. The shopping website is predicting this will be its busiest week of the year, with at least 4m items expected to be ordered. But one retail expert warned that shoppers would be the only winners on Black Friday, with retailers ultimately set to lose out as a result of reduced profit margins. Prof Chris Edger of Birmingham Business School said: \u201cBlack Friday has turned into a \u2018retail squid\u2019, with customer offers spreading throughout the month, sucking all margin out of November trading. The result will have grave consequences for profitability over the longer term for some retail players.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "BG faces battle with shareholders over chief executive\u2019s pay", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Oil and gas group BG faces an all-out battle with its shareholders after the biggest investor advisory group, ISS, rejected a \u00a325m pay deal for the company\u2019s new chief executive, while business secretary Vince Cable urged shareholders to vote against the huge pay packet. ISS, which influences the votes of many City investors, said it appeared the company\u2019s pay committee had not done its job properly. It urged investors to vote down Helge Lund\u2019s package at the extraordinary general meeting called to approve the pay package next month. Another shareholder advisory group, Manifest, called for the meeting to be adjourned. BG announced last month that it had recruited Lund, the boss of Norway\u2019s state oil group, with the lure of a \u00a312m \u201cgolden hello\u201d in shares and the chance to earn \u00a313.5m a year if he hits performance targets. BG has not disclosed those targets. Lund will be earning about seven times his previous pay package at Statoil. Cable told the Evening Standard: \u201cWe have given shareholders the power to vote this kind of excessive pay down and they have got to use it.\u201d Lund\u2019s pay deal has turned into a major test of shareholders\u2019 resolve when faced with outsize pay deals. The proposed deal requires approval at the meeting on 15 December because it breaches the pay policy approved by shareholders in May. ISS said: \u201cThe proposed award to the incoming CEO, agreed so soon after approval of the policy, suggests that the remuneration committee did not sufficiently anticipate the needs of the business.\u201d BG has warned shareholders that Lund might decide not to join the company if the vote goes against him, which some unhappy investors have viewed as an ultimatum. ISS said a vote for Lund\u2019s deal could encourage other incoming executives to demand pay that contravenes a company\u2019s pay policy by threatening not to join if shareholders reject the deal. BG has a fight on its hands because fund managers without corporate governance departments rely on ISS recommendations when voting on company resolutions. ISS\u2019s intervention follows criticism of BG by the Investment Management Association, which on Monday gave Lund\u2019s deal a \u201cred-top\u201d alert, reserved for the most serious breaches of corporate governance. On Tuesday, the Institute of Directors (IoD) attacked the award as \u201cexcessive, inflammatory and contrary to the principles of good governance\u201d. Simon Walker, director general of the IoD, said the bosses\u2019 group had \u201ca responsibility to criticise an action that brings the whole of British business into disrepute.\u201d Legal &amp; General, BG\u2019s fourth biggest shareholder, and Aviva, also a major investor in the UK stock market, have both expressed unease about the deal. BG and its City investors will also come under pressure from individual shareholders and pension savers over the deal. ShareAction, the responsible investment campaign group, on Wednesday launched an online means for thousands of its supporters to write to their pension funds about Lund\u2019s pay. Share Action said the campaign will have added impact after a recent Law Commission ruling that pension funds could pay attention to their savers\u2019 views as well as financial performance. ShareSoc, which represents individual shareholders, said it was mobilising its members and working with its German equivalent, DSW, to put pressure on BG. Mark Bentley, a ShareSoc director, said: \u201cAs shareholders, we need to show we are not susceptible to blackmail.\u201d After early criticism of Lund\u2019s pay, BG tried to placate investors by saying that he would not sell any of his shares while employed by the group. But with little more than two weeks until the meeting, further concessions are unlikely. A BG spokesman said: \u201cIn putting this to the vote, we are in line with the letter and the spirit of the new corporate governance legislation.\u201d",

Crude oil prices are skidding, with both the global Brent benchmark and the US standard, West Texas Intermediate, at four-year lows.

In years past the cartel did a great job keeping oil prices high and stable. But those high, steady prices also undermined Opec: it provided room for US shale-oil producers to invest in their infrastructure and create this now-gushing supply of black gold that rivals Opec.

But optimists hoping for action at next week\u2019s meeting may be disappointed, with any move more likely in the new year. With some disappointing US data, there was not much else to enthuse investors and the day ended as a pretty mixed bag ahead of US Thanksgiving and this week\u2019s meeting of the Opec oil cartel. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down just 1.97 points or 0.03% at 6729.17 Germany\u2019s Dax climbed 0.55% to 9915.56 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.2% lower at 4373.42 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged down 0.36% to 19,938.42 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.49% adrift at 10,647.0 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 8 points or 0.05% lower. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Back to the breakdown of those talks between Greek government officials and Troika officials in Paris. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Barely hours after their seeming collapse, the Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis has gone out of his way to put a positive spin on the Paris talks. The economics professor informed reporters in the French capital that things weren\u2019t as bad as they looked. Progress, he insisted, had been made on several fronts even if agreement had not been struck and a date settled for the auditors\u2019 return to Athens. \u201cThere was convergence on many issues,\u201d he was quoted as saying. Echoing that view, the European Commission\u2019s chief inspector Declan Costello, called the talks \u201cintense and constructive.\u201d Disagreement, once again, had centred on projections for next year\u2019s fiscal gap. Lenders argue it will be at least \u20ac2.5bn \u2013 far greater than the \u20ac350m now estimated by the Greek government - and, they claim, impossible to cover without further measures. Insiders said bleary-eyed participants (discussions lasted a marathon 11 hours ending at around 4 AM today) would go back to Greece in upbeat mood that negotiations that have come to be the hardest yet had \u201cmoved forward\u201d in some respects. Talks had focused on labour relations, pensions and administrative reforms \u2013 creditors are demanding that the country\u2019s loss-making pension system, in particular, be overhauled. Digging in its heels, the Greek side said further cuts would only backfire. \u201cWe are confident a date for the auditors return will be agreed shortly,\u201d said one official denying the negotiations had effectively collapsed. \u201cThis round [of negotiations] is especially strenuous precisely because it is the last.\u201d Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s \u20ac300bn plan to revive the eurozone economy sounds too good to be true, and it is, according to our economics editor Larry Elliott: Junkcer at least recognises there is a need to act, but there are problems with the scheme, writes Larry: The first drawback with the Juncker plan is that there is only \u20ac20bn (\u00a315bn) of new money, with the rest coming from the private sector. Brussels will provide guarantees should any of the investments in roads, railways, energy projects or a speedier internet go pear-shaped. Some critics have already dubbed this highly leveraged scheme as Juncker\u2019s version of subprime mortgage debt. In reality, Brussels has had little alternative but to provide seedcorn cash and hope it will generate private sector involvement. Between them Britain and Germany have ensured that the commission\u2019s budget remains tiny. Juncker simply does not have the funds available for a big increase in public spending. Given that the eurozone is a \u20ac13tn economy, what\u2019s on offer is pretty small beer. The second drawback is that the investment \u2013 even assuming it happens \u2013 will take time to arrive. Every European Union country has sent in a list of pet projects and these will have to be assessed by a panel of experts before a final list can be drawn up. This is a recipe for bureaucratic delay and the customary horse-trading as each country demands its share of the action. It is unlikely work on a single project will begin until 2016, when what Europe needs is an immediate boost to demand. Full comment here: Juncker\u2019s \u20ac300bn kickstarter sounds too good to be true \u2013 it is And here\u2019s the latest Reuters take on the Greece talks in Paris: Greece and its EU/IMF lenders failed to resolve differences over next year\u2019s budget at talks in Paris, a Greek official said on Wednesday, raising doubts about whether Athens can meet a deadline to wrap up its bailout programme. The two sides have been haggling over a projected budget shortfall next year, which has held up an overall deal on the final bailout review. Athens needs to strike that deal by a December 8 deadline to ensure it makes good on a pledge to quit its \u20ac240bn ($300bn) bailout by the end of the year. The official said there had been no discussion of extending the bailout beyond the end of the year, but also added that no date had been set for the return of EU/IMF inspectors to Athens. The inspectors failed to return to Athens as expected earlier this month and in a surprise move, the two sides held talks in Paris this week that ended on Wednesday. \u201cThe number one issue is the fiscal gap for 2015,\u201d the Greek finance ministry official told reporters after the talks ended. The lenders say Athens faces a shortfall of over \u20ac2bn next year unless it waters down a generous state arrears payback plan for austerity-hit Greeks or takes other measures. Athens says it faces no such shortfall and last week submitted its plans for a near-balanced budget to parliament without approval from the inspectors. Greece\u2019s government has staked its survival on abandoning the bailout. It is hoping an early exit from the reviled programme will help it win enough support to scrape through a presidential vote in February and avoid early elections. And more from Paris on the concluded talks between the Greek government and its troika of lenders: The next splurge of US data shows a mixed picture, with consumer sentiment up, Chicago manufacturing activity slowing and house sales disappointing. US consumer sentiment rose in November to its highest level in more than seven years. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan\u2019s final reading came in at 88.8, up from 86.9 in October but below the preliminary estimate of 89.4. Survey director Richard Curtin said: Consumers more frequently reported hearing about positive rather than negative economic developments in the November survey, with reports of improving employment the dominant news item. This contrasts with disappointing consumer confidence figures on Tuesday. Meanwhile the pace of business activity in the midwest slowed in November. The ISM Chicago business barometer fell from 66.2 in October to 60.8, below expectations of a figure of 63. Philip Uglow, chief economist of MNI Indicators - which publishes the report in partnership with ISM-Chicago - said: Following the sharp rise in the barometer to a one year high in October it wasn\u2019t too surprising to see activity ease somewhat in November. Overall the trend remains firm and activity looks set to pick up in the fourth quarter from the third. Finally sales of new single family homes rose for a third straight month in October, up 0.7% to an annual rate of 458,000 units compared to expectations of a figure of 472,000. And September\u2019s number was revised down from 467,000 to 455,000. The US data so far (there is more to come shortly in the form of housing, confidence and Chicago manufacturing) was not particularly re-assuring, says Rob Carnell at ING Bank: [The data] sheds some doubt on the positive message delivered by the previous day\u2019s upwards GDP revisions. October durable goods orders, for which the key focus is the core goods orders ex-defence and ex-aircraft, dipped 1.3% month on month, taking the three-month annualised trend down from 11.2% in September, to only 2.7% in October. Core capital goods shipments also declined, though not as much. These two categories usually give a rough approximation to quarterly business investment in equipment and software published in the GDP data. This is therefore a weak start to the fourth quarter. Adding to a weak set of orders data, the latest weekly initial jobless claims figure spiked higher too, rising from 292,000 to 313,000, and confirming that the last month has seen a reversal in the recent downtrend. Our suspicion is that this will be short-lived. We saw a similar spike in November last year. But it doesn\u2019t help when all the other data are also looking a bit soft. We will need to see claims data dip sharply down in the coming weeks if we are not to begin to doubt the resilience of the recovery in the labour market. Personal income and spending data were also disappointing, which also raises doubts about fourth quarter 2014 GDP (was already looking challenged) though there were some upwards revisions to the spending numbers that soften the blow a little. The September spending figure was revised to flat from -0.2%, so the undershoot of the October 0.3% consensus estimate by 0.1 percentage point isn\u2019t as bad as it first looks, but in no way suggests a strong rebound from the limp 2.2% annualised consumer spending growth recorded in the third quarter. These data may well explain why consumer confidence data took an unexpected dive in November, though there may also be some distortion showing through from the recent mid-term elections. Expectations of Fed tightening next year will doubtless be trimmed in the light of this data, sapping some support for the US dollar. Robin Bew, managing director of The Economist Intelligence Unit, is also unimpressed by the nitty-gritty of today\u2019s UK growth report. And.....US consumer spending only rose by 0.2% last month, missing forecasts of a 0.3% rise. The America\u2019s Commerce Department also reported that personal incomes rose by 0.2% in October, only half as fast as expected. A swath of economic data from across the Atlantic just hit the wires, as Americans clear the decks ready for Thanksgiving tomorrow. And they show that the number of US citizens signing on for unemployment benefit has hit the highest level since September, according to data just released. The Labor Department reports that the initial claims total rose to 313,000 last week, a gain of 21,000. The less-volatile four-week moving average remained below 300,000, though, suggesting the US jobs market is still recovering. And the number of \u2018continuing claims\u2019 (rather than new applications for benefits) hit a new 14 year low. And separately, US durable goods orders have beaten forecasts, with a rise of 0.4% last month. That\u2019s much stronger than the 0.6% fall which was pencilled in by Wall Street. However, the increase was mainly due to transportation orders - strip out orders for aeroplanes and engines, and durable goods were actually down by 0.9%. Time for a lunchtime recap. Economists fear that the UK economy remains dangerously unbalanced after the second estimate of UK growth in the third quarter of 2014 was released, showing businesses cut their investments and exports fell. The Office for National Statistics reported that GDP grew by 0.7%, in line with last month\u2019s initial estimates. That confirmed that the UK has now grown for the last seven quarters: But new details of expenditure in the economy worried several experts. The ONS found that business investment fell by 0.8% during the quarter, signalling that firms cut back on spending. And exports declined by 0.4%, which means the trade gap widened again. Instead, it was consumer spending (up 0.8%) and government expenditure (up 1.1%) that drove growth. Stephen Lewis, chief economist at ADM Investor Services, warns: These trends could not extend far without putting the UK economy in jeopardy. Lewis warns that growth will probably \u201csubside\u201d over the next few quarters. The drop in exports suggests Britain is already feeling the impact of the slowdown in Europe. Mark Miller, UK analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, warned that the weak eurozone economy means the UK will struggle to improve its position. The Treasury cautioned that Britain has reached a \u2018critical moment\u2019 in the recovery. Full coverage of the GDP report begins here. Expert reaction starts here The key charts are here. And here\u2019s our news story In other news: Shares in Thomas Cook are still down by 20% after the holiday firm shocked the City with the unexpected departure of CEO Harriet Green. Full story: Thomas Cook shares crash after Harriet Green is pushed out Our City editor Nils Pratley argues that investors deserve to hear what\u2019s actually happened: Thomas Cook should give shareholders a break EC president Jean-Claude Juncker has announced his new \u20ac315bn investment fund to drive European growth. He told MEPs in Strasbourg that \u201cChristmas has come early\u201d. But the reaction from experts is more muted; economist Sean Richards isn\u2019t impressed: And EC officials say the talks between Greece and its lenders have made some progress, after they ended this afternoon. The negotiations between Greece\u2019s government ministers and its international lenders in Paris have ended (at least for the moment), according to reports on the wires. And the two sides do not appear to have reached agreement over Greece\u2019s fiscal plans for 2015. The Troika had been demanding extra measures to cover a fiscal gap of around \u20ac3bn, which Athens denies is needed. Readers often point out that the UK recovery has not yet reached many people, as real wages having been falling for most of the last four years. This chart, from investment bank Citi, shows clearly that labour\u2019s \u201cshare of the pie\u201d has now fallen to the lowest in 16 years. The number of people in work in the Irish Republic it at its highest since 2009, our Dublin correspondent Henry McDonald reports: Unemployment is still falling with the jobless rate currently down to 11.% of the workforce in Ireland, according to the Central Statistics Office in Dublin. The CSO said this is the eight successive quarter of a year where there has been an annual increase in employment. The number of long term unemployed in Ireland is also falling from 7.6% to 6.4% from the previous quarter, the CSO said. Responding to the falling dole queue numbers, Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said: \u201cThe Irish Economy is growing strongly and most importantly jobs are being created. Budget 2015 was designed to strengthen and broaden this recovery to families across the country.\u201d In other news... property inflation in Ireland has hit its highest level in eight years, with prices up 16.3% year-on-year in October. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s UK growth data: UK GDP growth: fears mount that plan to rebalance economy is failing The latest survey of UK retail spending, from the CBI, has found that 44% of shops reported that sales this month are higher than a year ago, while 17% say they fell. The net balance of +27 is weaker than October\u2019s +31. Economics correspondent Phillip Inman says the survey points to a decent if not spectacular Christmas for high street shops. The distributive trades survey of 130 firms found that a majority expect conditions to improve over the next three months. They are employing more people and increasing investment in line with the modest trend set over the last year. The problem for shop owners that they are being forced to hold or drop their prices to get customers through the door. Yesterday Sir Philip Green, BhS and Top Shop owner, has already predicted a cut-price festive period. Barry Williams, the CBI\u2019s distributive trades survey chairman and Asda\u2019s chief merchandising officer for food, explains: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that it has been a demanding year for the retail industry but shopkeepers haven\u2019t been pulling their punches when it comes to getting shoppers through their doors \u2013 borne out with the lowest essential item inflation in five years and growing online sales. \u201cThis latest survey shows many have been winning some rounds in what has been one of the most challenging years for both the industry, and for customers. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing encouraging signs that pressure on family budgets is letting up, and although there is some way to go with the broader economy, there can be some optimism for retailers and customers alike as we enter the crucial run up to Christmas. With prices under pressure and more firms adopting US-style Black Friday offers, retailers are expecting a festive boost next month and are certainly doing their best to put smiles on customers\u2019 faces and make it easy on their pockets.\u201d Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has compared the second estimate of UK GDP to \u2018peeling off an onion ring\u2019. And the expenditure components of growth exposed today show that \u201cthe rebalancing of the economy is still some way off\u201d, he writes. The domestic economy expanded by 0.9%, with trade knocking 0.2 points off the quarterly growth rate. Consumer spending rose by 0.8% in the third quarter, while government expenditure was up by 1.1%. Business investment fell by 0.7%. Ministers can point to the weakness of the eurozone to explain away the poor export performance. This, though, is a feeble excuse given the weakness of exports \u2013 despite the boost from a substantial depreciation of sterling \u2013 throughout this parliament. So although Britain is growing faster than Germany or France, it still has the same problems: More here: UK economy is growing but the same old weaknesses are with us Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers group EEF, has urged George Osborne to give exporters more assistance. \u201cWhile business investment posted a bit of a dip, this isn\u2019t yet cause for concern as surveys of intentions across the private sector seem to be holding. The drag from net trade is, however, providing a bigger challenge to rebalancing ambitions. Next week\u2019s Autumn Statement needs to ensure that the business environment for companies planning to invest, recruit and get into new markets are a target for further action from the Chancellor.\u201d There is little evidence in today\u2019s GDP report that Britain\u2019s economy is rebalancing, warns Mark Miller, UK analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. The expenditure components do not suggest a meaningful shift to more balanced economic activity, with private consumption growth accelerating modestly during the latest quarter and exports contracting at the same pace as in the second quarter. And the troubles in the eurozone, which only grew 0.2% last month, may mean the UK remains too dependent on consumer spending rather than exports: Amid current signs of weaker growth in the euro zone, it is far from clear this re-balancing will be achieved anytime soon.\u201d Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: On the surface GDP looks OK, with growth unrevised at +0.7% quarter-on-quarter.... but the details are not good outside of the services sector\u2019s growth of 0.8%, revised up from a preliminary reading of 0.7% Several economists are warning that UK growth is unbalanced. Jeremy Cook, of currency exchange company, World First, said: \u201cOverall growth of 0.7% is still pretty strong, especially against yesterday\u2019s German figure of a meagre 0.1% increase in output. Unfortunately it is the make-up of this growth that has given us some cause for concern. \u201cSeeing consumer spending increase at 0.8% - the highest number in four years \u2013 is all well and good. Consumer spending makes up around 70% of the UK economy, so without it we would be in dire straits. \u201cIt is what\u2019s missing that is the issue; exports were 0.4% lower on the quarter - surely a function of diminishing growth prospects in the UK\u2019s major customer arenas - while government spending ran 1.1% higher \u2013 hardly a deficit neutral plan. These charts explain the situation in the UK economy today. 1) The recovery from the global recession of 2008 continued in the third quarter of this year. The 0.7% increase in GDP achieved in Q3 means the economy is now around 3.4% above its pre-crisis peak. The ONS says: GDP in the UK grew steadily during the 2000s until a financial market shock affected UK and global economic growth in 2008 and 2009. Economic growth resumed towards the end of 2009, but typically at a slower rate than the period prior to 2008. Quarterly growth in this period was also erratic, with several quarters between 2010 and 2012 recording flat or declining GDP. This two- year period coincided with special events (for example severe winter weather in Q4 2010 and the Diamond Jubilee in Q2 2012) that are likely to have affected growth. Since 2013, GDP has grown steadily, exceeding its pre-downturn peak in Q3 2013. 2) Britain\u2019s service sector is the only part of the economy that is larger than in 2008. And with growth of 0.8% last quarter, vs 0.2% for production, the gap between the \u2018dominant service sector\u2019 and the rest is widening. 3) Consumer spending and government spending both helped the economy grow last quarter, but Britain\u2019s trade performance held it back. 4) The trade gap widened, as UK exports declined by 0.4% last quarter while imports increased by 1.4%. George Osborne\u2019s \u201cMarch of the Makers\u201d may be stumbling, as headwinds from the global economy hit exporters. 5) America has grown much faster than the UK since the start of the financial crisis. But Europe and Japan (which has fallen back into recession) have under-performed. c Britain was not the fastest growing member of the G7 in the last quarter alone. America\u2019s economy expanded by almost 1% in the July-September period, according to data released yesterday. However, the US did contract last winter, so its annual growth rate lags behind the UK. The UK Treasury has declared that The Plan is working (does any Treasury statement not say that these days?!): \u201cToday\u2019s figures show that the government\u2019s long term economic plan is working, with the fastest annual growth in the G7 and all the main sectors of the economy growing. But the UK is not immune to weakness in the euro area and instability in global markets, so we face a critical moment for our economy. We need to carry on working through our economic plan that is securing a resilient economy and a better future.\u201d You can see the full GDP report yourself, on the ONS website (right-click to open in a new tab). Newsnight economics editor Duncan Weldon agrees that the GDP report isn\u2019t very encouraging, even though growth was confirmed at 0.7%. The ONS also reports that Britain\u2019s trade balance deficit widened in the last quarter, from \u00a38.9bn in Q2 2014 to \u00a311.2bn in Q3 And that\u2019s because exports declined, while imports grew. The ONS says: Following a 0.4% decrease in Q2 2014, exports fell by 0.4% in the latest quarter, while imports increased by 1.4%. With exports contracting and imports increasing, the net trade balance worsened when compared to the previous quarter. And for all the talk of rebalancing the economy, consumer spending continues to help drive the recovery. The ONS says household final consumption expenditure rose by 0.8% in Q3 2014 and has increased for thirteen consecutive quarters. Yesterday, Bank of England policymaker Kristin Forbes told MPs that people have been dipping into their savings to fund spending; that\u2019s why real wage growth is desperately needed. The ONS says that the drop in business investment was led by \u201cthe intellectual property products (IPP), and in particular the software component of this asset\u201d. This isn\u2019t great news either: Business investment in the UK fell by 0.7% in the third quarter of the year. That is the first drop in business investment since the second quarter of 2013, and follows 3.3% growth in Q2. The UK construction sector grew by 0.8%, in line with the first estimate of GDP. The UK recovery looks less balanced, according to the data just released. The ONS has revised up growth in the service sector in the last quarter to +0.8%, from +0.7% originally. But industrial production has been revised down - output only grew by 0.2%, not the 0.5% first estimated. That\u2019s mainly due to a drop in activity in mining and quarrying. Breaking: The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the third quarter of this year, the Office for National Statistics says. That\u2019s in line with the initial estimate last month. That means GDP expanded by a healthy-looking 3% over the last year. But there\u2019s lots more detail about how the economy performed.... Here comes the second estimate of UK GDP..... Heads up: European Central Bank vice-president Vitor Constancio has declared that the ECB could start a full-blown quantitative easing programme early next year. In a speech in London, Constancio slaps down suggestions that the ECB shouldn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t, embark on sovereign QE (buying government bonds with new money). It would, he says, be a \u201cpurely monetary policy decision\u201d, within the ECB\u2019s \u201cmandate and our legal competence\u201d. And the ECB should be able to tell whether to do it, or now, during the first quarter of 2015. Steve Collins, global head of dealing at London &amp; Capital Asset Management, reckons Constancio has stirred things up: In the financial markets.... the pound is flat this morning at $1.571 as traders wait for the second estimate of UK GDP to be released at 9.30am. European stock markets are up this morning. Traders say that yesterday\u2019s strong US GDP figures, showing its economy growing by almost 4%, FTSE 100: up 15 points at 6746 German DAX: up 53 points at 9914 French CAC: up 2 points at 4385 No respite for Thomas Cook; shares are still down around 20% as investors wonder exactly what\u2019s behind Harriet Green\u2019s exit. Green has given some intriguing interviews this year. In January she told Management Today that she won\u2019t hang around when the time comes to leave the company: \u2018CEOs spend too long in the same job,\u2019 she says. \u2018You should do what you have to do, have maybe a couple of years hugging everyone and then move on. I think that adds up to six or seven years, not 16 or 17.\u2019 Not just two years, then? The Times also ran a big piece on her last month (starting at 5.30am in the gym of the five-star Mayfair hotel where she spends the week), in which she was \u201cadamant\u201d that she was nowhere near finished at Thomas Cook: Recent \u201cbabble\u201d that she might take a peerage and a government job is nonsense. \u201cAnyone who knows me in the least would know that a tap on the shoulder to be Lady Whatever to solve the National Health Service is not me, not how I function. I don\u2019t like any form of supervision, let alone government and voters.\u201d Juncker began his appearance in the European Parliament by declaring that \u201cChristmas has come early\u201d, as he explained how his \u20ac315bn investment fund would work. He concluded by warning MEPs that \u2018there can be no turning back\u201d. The BBC website has a rolling report: BBC: European Parliament live Over in Strasbourg Brussels , European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker is proudly unveiling his new multi-billion euro investment fund. Juncker, who must be relieved to be discussing growth rather than tax avoidance, says Europe needs a \u201ckick-start\u201d, and this is the way to do it. He insists that the \u20ac315bn fund is new money. [although, as explained in the introduction, there\u2019s only \u20ac20bn or so of seed capital], and suggested the fund could be extended. Juncker urged EU leaders to back the idea, declaring: We need political support for this investment plan, not a politicisation of the plan. As a teaser, he also promised that money paid into the fund by EU states will not be counted when Brussels assesses their deficit levels. Juncker is also painting a picture in which school children in Greece are blessed with new PCs to help them learn: Here\u2019s our news story on the shenanigans at Thomas Cook: Thomas Cook chief Harriet Green in shock departure The sudden, unexpected nature of Harriet Green\u2019s departure has clearly spooked investors: Shares in Thomas Cook have plunged by 20% at the start of trading, following the shock exit of CEO Harriet Green. The company\u2019s warning that growth will be more measured, in the \u201ctougher trading environment\u201d has also alarmed the City. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, explains: Investors will be right to ask questions over how her departure will affect the turnaround plan, so expect much of the price reaction today to be in connection to this. The other issue is the turnaround plan \u2013 the warning that growth will be more moderate (i.e. slower) in the coming year is a sign that the easy bit has been done. Frank Meysman, chairman of Thomas Cook, is facing the press (by telephone) to explain the unexpected departure of CEO Harriet Green. He\u2019s confirmed that Green will receive a six-month payoff, and also stated that the company needs a boss with a more detailed grasp of the industry (?!). My colleague Sean Farrell is tweeting the key points: Meysman also harked back to Green\u2019s low-sleep lifestyle (a Thatcherite four hours oir less, apparently): Big news in the City this morning \u2013 Harriet Green, the businesswoman who led the turnaround of holiday chain Thomas Cook, is leaving the company with immediate effect. Green only joined Thomas Cook two years ago -- and won plaudits for revitalising its fortunes. Its share price has risen from 14p when she arrived, to around 137.9p yesterday The company says: Her remit was to transform the company, placing it on a sound financial footing with a solid operational team able to compete in the consumer travel market. Green \u2013 who has declared that sleep is overrated (hear hear) \u2013 adds: I always said that I would move on to another company with fresh challenges once my work was complete. That time is now. But her departure is certainly a shock -- two years isn\u2019t exactly a long stint as CEO. And Thomas Cook may be heading into stormier waters; it says the trading environment is \u201ctougher\u201d, so: \u201cwe now expect to deliver further growth this year at a more moderate pace\u201d. A challenge for her successor, COO Peter Fankhauser. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up this morning... we get the second estimate of UK GDP this morning, at 9.30am. It should confirm that Britain\u2019s economy grew by 0.7% in the July-September quarter, as first estimated last month. The Office for National Statistics will also provide more details about how the economy performed; business investment is expected to have been pretty robust, while the services sector is outpacing manufacturing. It\u2019s the last healthcheck on the UK economy before the government publishes its Autumn Statement next week. And with election fever mounting in Britain (just six months to go!), the data will be scrutinised in the City and Westminster. Growth of 0.7% would mean Britain has outpaced European rivals such as Germany and France, who only expanded by 0.1% and 0.3% respectively. But it would leave us lagging behind America; its updated GDP data, released yesterday, showed quarterly growth of almost 1%. Also coming up today.... There\u2019s a deluge of US economic data this afternoon, as America clears the decks ready for the Thanksgiving turkey. That includes the latest durable goods data, and the weekly jobless figures. European Commission President Juncker will get a break from criticism of Luxembourg\u2019s tax regime, when he unveils his \u20ac315bn investment plan for Europe. Well, officially it\u2019s a \u20ac315bn plan, but it is actually only backed by around \u20ac20bn of seed capital. Juncker hopes to raise funds from private investors to drive new projects around Europe, to tackle the jobs crisis and inject more growth. Greek ministers will continue talks in Paris with their lenders, in an attempt to close their latest bailout review. Yesterday\u2019s negotiations were heavy going, it appears: Kathimerini: Slow first day of troika talks in Paris And the oil market could be lively, as OPEC members prepare for tomorrow\u2019s meeting in Vienna. The latest murmurings are that oil producers are resisting cutting output, despite seeing the oil price tumble sharply in the last few months.",

Brussels will provide guarantees should any of the investments in roads, railways, energy projects or a speedier internet go pear-shaped. Some critics have already dubbed this highly leveraged scheme as Juncker\u2019s version of subprime mortgage debt.</p> <p>In reality, Brussels has had little alternative but to provide seedcorn cash and hope it will generate private sector involvement. Between them Britain and Germany have ensured that the commission\u2019s budget remains tiny. Juncker simply does not have the funds available for a big increase in public spending. Given that the eurozone is a \u20ac13tn economy, what\u2019s on offer is pretty small beer.</p> <p>The second drawback is that the investment \u2013 even assuming it happens \u2013 will take time to arrive. Every European Union country has sent in a list of pet projects and these will have to be assessed by a panel of experts before a final list can be drawn up. This is a recipe for bureaucratic delay and the customary horse-trading as each country demands its share of the action. It is unlikely work on a single project will begin until 2016, when what Europe needs is an immediate boost to demand.</p> </blockquote> <p>Full comment here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/26/junckers-300bn-infrastructure-plan-too-good-to-be-true\">Juncker\u2019s \u20ac300bn kickstarter sounds too good to be true \u2013 it is</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5475f279e4b05735abcbf4c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-26T15:34:18.709Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s the latest Reuters take on the Greece talks in Paris:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Greece and its EU/IMF lenders failed to resolve differences over next year\u2019s budget at talks in Paris, a Greek official said on Wednesday, raising doubts about whether Athens can meet a deadline to wrap up its bailout programme.</p> <p>The two sides have been haggling over a projected budget shortfall next year, which has held up an overall deal on the final bailout review.

Core capital goods shipments also declined, though not as much. These two categories usually give a rough approximation to quarterly business investment in equipment and software published in the GDP data. This is therefore a weak start to the fourth quarter.<br></p> <p>Adding to a weak set of orders data, the latest weekly initial jobless claims figure spiked higher too, rising from 292,000 to 313,000, and confirming that the last month has seen a reversal in the recent downtrend. Our suspicion is that this will be short-lived. We saw a similar spike in November last year. But it doesn\u2019t help when all the other data are also looking a bit soft. We will need to see claims data dip sharply down in the coming weeks if we are not to begin to doubt the resilience of the recovery in the labour market.<br></p> <p>Personal income and spending data were also disappointing, which also raises doubts about fourth quarter 2014 GDP (was already looking challenged) though there were some upwards revisions to the spending numbers that soften the blow a little. The September spending figure was revised to flat from -0.2%, so the undershoot of the October 0.3% consensus estimate by 0.1 percentage point isn\u2019t as bad as it first looks, but in no way suggests a strong rebound from the limp 2.2% annualised consumer spending growth recorded in the third quarter.<br></p> <p>These data may well explain why consumer confidence data took an unexpected dive in November, though there may also be some distortion showing through from the recent mid-term elections. Expectations of Fed tightening next year will doubtless be trimmed in the light of this data, sapping some support for the US dollar.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5475dbb9e4b012ac8415b3c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-26T13:56:15.386Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Robin Bew, managing director of The Economist Intelligence Unit, is also unimpressed by the nitty-gritty of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2014/nov/26/uk-economy-growth-gdp-business-live#block-5475ce8be4b0bf2ade60ce66\">today\u2019s UK growth report</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobinBew/statuses/537603129328824321\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Decent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UK?src=hash\">#UK</a> GDP data but the devil is in the detail.

The business secretary, who oversaw the controversial privatisation of Royal Mail, said the government did not want companies \u201cwhinging\u201d about being in a competitive market. His intervention came after Royal Mail stepped up warnings that its public duty to deliver mail anywhere in the country, six days a week, for the same price, is under threat. Chief executive Moya Greene told a committee of MPs that the universal service obligation was \u201cprecious\u201d and essential for most people. But it had a high fixed cost and depended on steady revenues from urban areas to cross-subsidise more costly deliveries to rural parts of the country, she said. Royal Mail faced a 4-6% decline in its letters business each year, while competitors were being allowed to \u201ccherry-pick\u201d the easiest and most lucrative deliveries to urban areas, putting the economics of the universal service at risk, Greene said. \u201cIf you allow cherry-picking in urban areas you undermine the economics,\u201d she told MPs. \u201cIt siphons off very quickly a lot of revenue, more revenue than can be offset even by very vigorous efficiency measures.\u201d Greene urged the postal regulator, Ofcom, to bring forward a review into safeguarding the universal service obligation, \u201cbefore too much damage is done\u201d. The watchdog has pledged to begin its work before the end of 2015. Her demand was supported by trade unions, which said there was a need for urgent action to protect the universal service. \u201cThe sustainability of the universal service obligation faces its greatest threat at the moment,\u201d said Dave Ward, deputy general secretary at the Communication Workers Union, which represents 90% of Royal Mail staff. But Royal Mail\u2019s competitors denied the universal service was in peril and said the entry of more players into the market has been good for consumers. \u201cThe benefit of competition is that we will keep Royal Mail honest, keep prices down and keep consumers posting,\u201d said Nick Wells, chief executive of Whistl, a private operator that emerged after TNT Group split in 2011. Royal Mail revealed last week that it had been forced to scale back growth forecasts for its parcels business, after the online retailer Amazon began developing its own delivery operations. Amazon launched the same-day service in the UK last month, with a promise to deliver parcels to hundreds of newsagents across the country. Roy Perticucci, vice-president of Amazon\u2019s EU operations, declined to comment on reports that its service had led to a 20% drop in Royal Mail\u2019s parcel volumes in some localities, citing commercial confidentiality.",

      "bodyText": "Large German companies face a major shake-up after the government ordered that at least a third of executive positions be filled by women. The agreement, which was reached by the ruling coalition after months of heated debate, will involve the Frauenquote \u2013 or women\u2019s quotas \u2013 being signed into law in December. Companies will have to start implementing the law by 2016. The decision will have a major impact on 108 of Germany\u2019s largest firms, many of which have resisted the legislation. Several firms, including some major car manufacturers, have threatened to move their production abroad if the law was passed. An estimated 3,500 smaller businesses will be obliged to introduce gender-equality goals and to publish these over the coming years. Businesses will not be allowed to claim that they cannot find enough suitable women candidates. Any that do will have to leave positions vacant under what has been termed the \u201cempty chair sanction\u201d. The women\u2019s affairs minister, Manuela Schwesig of the Social Democrats, said she hoped the law would also promote change further down the pecking order of companies, whether those listed on the stock exchange or the smaller mittelstand firms. \u201cThis law is an important step for equality because it will initiate cultural change in the workplace,\u201d she told German radio. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who initially opposed the reform, told the Bundestag on Wednesday: \u201cIt has been decided on and it is coming. We cannot afford to do without the skills of women.\u201d But Ulrich Grillo of the German Industries Federation, at the same time as insisting that companies wanted more women in leadership roles, dismissed the law as counterproductive, insisting that voluntary solutions were preferable. Justice minister Heiko Maas said the agreement was historic and would make Germany a more modern country. Some business leaders had said the law was not necessary because equality between the sexes is anchored in the German constitution. But Schwesig said equality was \u201cfar from being true in real life\u201d. The effects of the law, she said, had the potential to go beyond the boardroom and would ultimately contribute to a change in society. In contrast to Britain and the US, Germany has a two-tier board system comprising both non-executive supervisory boards, consisting of outside advisers, and full-time executive boards, which manage the company on a daily basis. Supervisory boards are currently made up of about 22% of women, yet they hold only 12% of executive board posts. Writing in the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, commentator Heribert Prantl said the introduction of a frauenquote was simply bringing an end to the fact that \u201cfor ever and a day in top positions in business there have been male quotas of almost 100%. So the frauenquote are not the introduction of quotas, rather they are breaking through existing quotas \u2026 they are a tool to establish sensible standards. Just as children learn to swim with armbands, so the women\u2019s quotas are the armbands of society.\u201d",

The effects of the law, she said, had the potential to go beyond the boardroom and would ultimately contribute to a change in society.</p> <p>In contrast to Britain and the US, Germany has a two-tier board system comprising both non-executive supervisory boards, consisting of outside advisers, and full-time executive boards, which manage the company on a daily basis.</p> <p>Supervisory boards are currently made up of about 22% of women, yet they hold only 12% of executive board posts.</p> <p>Writing in the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, commentator Heribert Prantl said the introduction of a <em>frauenquote</em> was simply bringing an end to the fact that \u201cfor ever and a day in top positions in business there have been male quotas of almost 100%. So the <em>frauenquote</em> are not the introduction of quotas, rather they are breaking through existing quotas \u2026 they are a tool to establish sensible standards. Just as children learn to swim with armbands, so the women\u2019s quotas are the armbands of society.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "<p>Gold, once challenged, is running up in price. Now Switzerland is voting this week to add more to its gold reserves -- a move that could boost prices by $50 per ounce. Ron Paul and investor Marc Faber who don\u2019t trust the current financial system think the conversation about gold should go global</p>", 
      "body": "<p>Swiss voters are likely to reject a November 30 referendum to force the Swiss National Bank to hold 20% of its reserves in gold, but you can\u2019t crush a gold bug. <br></p> <p>Die-hard gold fans \u2013 known as \u2018gold bugs\u2019 \u2013 aren\u2019t discouraged by the impending rejection of the Swiss people for their favorite metal.</p> <p>Their faith in the yellow metal remains rock-solid, even as prices are down about 37% from gold\u2019s all-time nominal high of around $1,920 an ounce, set in September 2011. Proponents say gold is now a bargain and plump for the yellow metal as an insurance policy against economic disasters. They point to the lack of growth in Europe and Japan and China\u2019s growth slowdown. And they don\u2019t buy the improvement in the US economy.</p> <p>More importantly, the Swiss vote puts gold in the international spotlight again -- right where gold bugs like it. <br></p> <p>\u201cIn my view point we always win if we can get the discussion out,\u201d says former congressman Ron Paul, a well-known gold-standard proponent.</p> <p>The \u201cSave Our Swiss Gold\u201d referendum would force the Swiss National Bank to raise its gold holdings to equal 20% of its monetary reserves \u2013 plus the country must repatriate all the Swiss gold held in other countries and it must never sell any of its gold. Based on current holdings, the SNB has 1,040 metric tons of gold. </p> <p>This isn\u2019t completely random. Switzerland and gold go as well together as Switzerland and chocolate. Jim Steel, metals analyst at HSBC, said as recently as 1996 the Swiss constitution required the Swiss franc to be 40% backed by gold.</p> <p>Steel said if the referendum passes the SNB would likely need to buy about 1,500 metric tons of gold, which is roughly half of annual global mine production.

      "bodyText": "Swiss voters are likely to reject a November 30 referendum to force the Swiss National Bank to hold 20% of its reserves in gold, but you can\u2019t crush a gold bug. Die-hard gold fans \u2013 known as \u2018gold bugs\u2019 \u2013 aren\u2019t discouraged by the impending rejection of the Swiss people for their favorite metal. Their faith in the yellow metal remains rock-solid, even as prices are down about 37% from gold\u2019s all-time nominal high of around $1,920 an ounce, set in September 2011. Proponents say gold is now a bargain and plump for the yellow metal as an insurance policy against economic disasters. They point to the lack of growth in Europe and Japan and China\u2019s growth slowdown. And they don\u2019t buy the improvement in the US economy. More importantly, the Swiss vote puts gold in the international spotlight again -- right where gold bugs like it. \u201cIn my view point we always win if we can get the discussion out,\u201d says former congressman Ron Paul, a well-known gold-standard proponent. The \u201cSave Our Swiss Gold\u201d referendum would force the Swiss National Bank to raise its gold holdings to equal 20% of its monetary reserves \u2013 plus the country must repatriate all the Swiss gold held in other countries and it must never sell any of its gold. Based on current holdings, the SNB has 1,040 metric tons of gold. This isn\u2019t completely random. Switzerland and gold go as well together as Switzerland and chocolate. Jim Steel, metals analyst at HSBC, said as recently as 1996 the Swiss constitution required the Swiss franc to be 40% backed by gold. Steel said if the referendum passes the SNB would likely need to buy about 1,500 metric tons of gold, which is roughly half of annual global mine production. They can buy it over five years, but he said a \u201cyes\u201d vote by Switzerland could quickly raise the price of gold everywhere by $50. \u201cThis would reaffirm gold\u2019s status in the international financial system and boost gold market sentiment,\u201d Steel said, but a \u201cno\u201d vote would be unlikely to send prices much lower since that\u2019s expected. Not surprisingly, the SNB and the major Swiss political parties are against the measure. On Sunday SNB president Thomas Jordan said the referendum would restrict the flexibility of the bank to respond to crises. Restricting the power of banks is the point, say the bugs. \u201cIt is about time that the power of central banks is contained and regulated. The Swiss gold initiative, while not ideal, would be a starting point,\u201d said Marc Faber, editor of the Gloom, Boom, Doom Report, a newsletter. More importantly, they still say having a gold standard, or fixing a currency\u2019s value in terms of gold, is the only way to prevent coming hyperinflation and other ills, caused by runaway spending by global central banks.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI always said that I would move on to another company with fresh challenges once my work was complete,\u201d says Harriet Green. If she did say that, neither she nor her chairman at Thomas Cook, Frank Meysman, told the shareholders. Indeed, Green seems to have spent much of the last year emphasising that knocking Thomas Cook into shape remains a work in progress, despite the sharp improvement in the share price since her arrival in 2012. \u201cThis is an exciting journey as we build for the future,\u201d she wrote in the annual report almost exactly a year ago. In January she argued that chief executives shouldn\u2019t hang around too long but defined a reasonable innings as \u201csix or seven years\u201d. Only last week she said at a Management Today conference: \u201cYou can\u2019t do a transformation on this sort of scale in a year or two years. I usually say it\u2019s about six years.\u201d If those words don\u2019t make the point sufficiently forcefully, Thomas Cook\u2019s numbers for 2013-14 do: today the company announced a pretax loss of \u00a3114m. Even if one takes more flattering \u201cunderlying\u201d measures, more work plainly lies ahead: pre-interest and pretax profits margins were only 3.8%. Today, however, Thomas Cook shareholders are asked to believe that Green\u2019s exit is all part of a smooth plan hatched a year ago when Peter Fankhauser, the new boss, was promoted to be chief operating officer. The company\u2019s press release even uses the dreaded word \u201ctransition\u201d, normally reserved for cases where there is a formal handover period between chief executives. Green\u2019s departure, however, is with \u201cimmediate effect\u201d. Did she resign or was she pushed? Thomas Cook\u2019s annoucement doesn\u2019t even answer that question clearly, preferring the ambiguous \u201cstepping down\u201d. But she will get compensation for loss of office. That suggests, at the very least, that the company encouraged her to depart now. Green, of course, is entitled to boast about her success at Thomas Cook. The company\u2019s survival was in doubt in 2012, which was why the shares were just 14p. The crediblilty of her cost-cutting plan, and the speed of its execution, boosted both confidence and the share price and made last year\u2019s \u00a3425m placing and rights issue possible. But the notion that \u201cmy work is complete\u201d is pushing the limits of credibility. The placing, by the way, was struck at 137p per share. The share price, after today\u2019s slump, is 110p. Shareholders who stumped up for that fundraising deserve better than a heavily airbrushed account of why Green is leaving now. BG is not unique BG Group can still expect to win the vote on 15 December on incoming boss Helge Lund\u2019s big pay package. The objections aired by ISS, the proxy voting service used by many US fund managers, and the Institute of Directors are significant. But most fund managers, in the end, will probably hold their noses, or convince themselves it would be irresponsible to risk leaving a large FTSE 100 company without a chief executive. Lund, remember, has negotiated a contract where he is not obliged to turn up if shareholders don\u2019t approve his \u00a312m golden hello. But this affair goes wider than BG. It is also political because the effect of a yes vote would be to undermine an important element of business secretary Vince Cable\u2019s pay reforms. His supposedly binding vote on pay policies would be rendered semi-redundant if companies feel they can simply call a new meeting of shareholders to force through a package that falls outside the agreed terms. That, in effect, is what BG is doing. Its shareholders approved a pay policy six months ago, but now the board wants to do something else for Lund on the grounds that he\u2019s a big catch who wouldn\u2019t come for anything less than a \u00a312m share award and the chance to earn up to \u00a314m a year. Strictly speaking, BG could argue that it is following the letter of Cable\u2019s reforms by calling a new vote; after all, shareholders still have the power to decide. But that would be disingenuous. Everybody assumed agreed pay policies were meant to be implemented, not by-passed at the first spot of bother. As ISS notes, a precedent would be set: \u201cSupport for this proposal could encourage incoming executives (and elsewhere) to negotiate rewards which are outside the scope of the formal remuneration policy and make shareholder approval of the rewards a condition of their employment, on the assumption that shareholders are unlikely to vote down the proposal.\u201d Quite. If one company can successfully plead \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d others will be tempted to have a go. Every board thinks its recruitment difficulties are unique. Leahy speaks up For a chap who had supposedly taken a vow of silence about his Tesco years, Sir Terry Leahy is saying more and more. He thinks the group \u201clost sight of its customers\u201d, reports the London Evening Standard. Fair enough, many people diagnose exactly that failing. Sadly, the question of whether the rot developed on Leahy\u2019s watch, or only after he left, appears not to have been addressed. Never mind, it\u2019s another comment that is remarkable. The former chief executive is reported as saying that, given time, Fresh &amp; Easy would have been a good business. Blimey. The US adventure, billed at launch as a low-risk experiment, never made a profit in six years of operation and ended up costing Tesco\u2019s shareholders nearly \u00a32bn. How much time did Leahy think it needed?",

United Utilities has dipped 6p to 908.5p after virtually flat half year profits of \u00a3340.5m. Marks &amp; Spencer has added 3.5p to 484.4p after JP Morgan began coverage with an overweight rating and 550p price target, while as part of a review of the retail sector Canaccord Genuity issued a hold rating with a 500p target. Canaccord said: For too long, the consistent and laudable progress of Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s food division has been undermined by the weak and faltering performance of its General Merchandise (GM) division, which is dominated by clothing. Womenswear is the largest constituent of clothing and has seen market share erosion for several years. October\u2019s interim results surprised on the upside through the delivery of a better than expected gross margin gain in GM, primarily from supply chain efficiencies (and improved markdown performance). Guidance on GM gross margin was raised, and together with as yet unquantified future gains from moving the \u201cdirect design\u201d mix from 25% to 60% over the next three years, M&amp;S could be about to embark on a gross margin improvement journey lasting several years. It remains to be seen whether this is to be the bright start of a new era or another false dawn, hence our hold recommendation on initiation with a target price of 500p. But Canaccord did damage to Qinetiq, cutting from hold to sell and 205p to 180p. The defence technology group - whose chief executive Leo Quinn is leaving to join Balfour Beatty - is down 7.8p at 198.3p. Canaccord said: We downgrade QinetiQ on a combination of accelerating cash outflows, margin pressure and a period of limbo during the chief executive transition. We see the stock underperforming through this period.",

      "bodyText": "Overhauling the broken culture of high street banking will take a generation to achieve, according to a report that found UK banks have received 20m customer complaints since the financial crisis. The report, by the thinktank New City Agenda, calculated that in the last 15 years the retail operations of banks had incurred \u00a338.5bn in fines and redress for mistreatment of customers. Andre Spicer, a professor at Cass Business School and the report\u2019s lead author, said: \u201cMost people we spoke to told us that real change will take at least five years. \u201cThere was some uncertainty as to how these changes were being translated into good practice at the customer coalface. Many culture change initiatives are fragile, and their success is not ensured. It\u2019s clear to us that much work still needs to be done.\u201d The report concluded that it will take a generation to end a sales culture exposed by the 2008 crisis. It said UK banks did not address cultural change until the eruption of the Libor scandal in 2012, having failed to act after the emergence of mis-selling debacles such as the payment protection insurance scandal. \u201cA toxic culture, decades in the making, will take a generation to clean up,\u201d said the founders of New City Agenda, who are Labour peer Lord McFall, Conservative MP David Davis, and Liberal Democrat peer Lord Sharkey. They added: \u201cSome frontline staff told us they still feel under significant pressure to sell. Complaints continue to rise and trust remains extremely low. Most of the people we talked to believed that real change, and as a consequence the better treatment of customers, will take some time to achieve.\u201d It took the Libor scandal \u2013 rather than mis-selling debacles such as payment protection insurance which has cost \u00a327bn \u2013 to force banks to embark on initiatives to change the culture, the report said. The report focuses on retail banking and highlights one employee saying how she turned up for work early for a \u201chuddle\u201d and then had a team \u201ccuddle\u201d at the end of the day. Attendance at these team meetings was unpaid. Others had cabbages placed on their desks if they had underperformed. Staff at Barclays said the work environment was getting better but staff at other banks felt they were under greater pressure. The report said employees were wary of change because of the job cuts and changes in top management which had taken place since the crisis. \u201cThe old culture is ingrained. A number of banks told us that one of the largest challenges they faced was that the existing culture was highly ingrained in their people,\u201d the report said. Among the ideas put forward is for chief executives and chairmen to be responsible for culture after one of the people interviewed for the report highlighted the \u201cmurder on the Orient Express defence\u201d deployed at banks, where everyone was to blame. The report also calls on investors to provide support for the cultural changes under way at banks. \u201cOver-reacting to short-term profits will be unhelpful,\u201d the report said. It added that the Banking Standards Review Council \u2013 established by banks to set out new guidelines for the industry \u2013 should make an annual report to the Treasury select committee and conduct an annual survey of frontline staff to establish whether aggressive sales cultures still exist. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who sits on the board of New City Agenda, said the fines imposed on banks this month for forex rigging showed \u201cthe length of the journey of culture change that still needs to be travelled\u201d. Welby sat on the parliamentary commission on banking standards, set up in the wake of the 2012 Libor rigging fines. McFall, who also sat on the commission, said banks needed to ensure \u201cthey are straining every sinew to put customers back at the heart of retail banking. \u201cIn the past, the interests of customers were often totally disregarded. Some were brazenly exploited.\u201d New City Agenda receives funding from Which?, Prudential, HSBC, Berenberg UK, London Stock Exchange Group and the City of London Corporation. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 November 2014. An earlier version said the New City Agenda report calculated that the retail operations of banks had incurred \u00a338.5m in fines and compensation in the past 15 years. That figure has been corrected to \u00a338.5bn.",
