      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca, Britain\u2019s second-largest drugmaker, is to announce further investment in its Macclesfield site in northern England, in a boost for Britain\u2019s \u00a360bn life sciences industry. The move, worth tens of millions of pounds, is expected to be announced this week when the government launches its industrial strategy for the sector in Birmingham on Wednesday. However, there will not be an expansion of manufacturing. The investment will fund technical improvements at the packing site in Macclesfield, Cheshire. AstraZeneca\u2019s \u00a3150m factory in Macclesfield produces breast cancer drugs such as Zoladex, one of the firm\u2019s biggest-selling products. About 1,800 people work across the Macclesfield site. An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said the move was \u201cpart of our ongoing investment in the UK\u201d. Mene Pangalos, who runs its innovative medicines and early development biotech unit, is expected to announce the firm\u2019s plans in Birmingham. AstraZeneca is not committing to manufacturing expansion in the UK as it waits for clarity on the government\u2019s Brexit plans. Last month, its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said the company would \u201cwait to see\u201d before committing itself to further investment in Britain because of uncertainty in the pharmaceutical industry following the vote to leave the EU, in particular over the regulatory regime for new medicines. Drugmakers are worried that the approval of new drugs could take longer after Brexit, to the detriment of patients. The EU regulator, the European Medicines Agency, will relocate from London, with Amsterdam tipped as the most likely new base for the agency. Nineteen countries have applied to host the agency once the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, and a decision on the winner is due in November. In another blow to Britain, two major UK research organisations will lose much of their business to Amsterdam if the Netherlands is successful in its bid. Soriot said last month that AstraZeneca would carry on investing at its new \u00a3500m headquarters in Cambridge, where it will open a biomedical campus next year, which will be its biggest centre globally for cancer research. AstraZeneca\u2019s latest plans will be announced when Sir John Bell, a Canadian-British immunologist, geneticist and Oxford University professor, lays out his proposals for the life sciences industry this week. His report, backed by the government, is expected to recommend new tax breaks and other support for the sector to boost research and exports of medicines, including an apprenticeship scheme. Last week, Britain\u2019s pharma industry called on the government to fund the creation of four new centres of excellence for medicines manufacturing in Britain, at a cost of \u00a3140m. The Medicines Manufacturing Industry Partnership (MMIP) argued this would help plug gaps in areas such as diagnostics and packaging, advanced therapy production and small molecule processing, and create highly skilled jobs in the regions. Andy Evans, head of AstraZeneca\u2019s Macclesfield operations, who chairs the MMIP, said: \u201cThe UK is already one of the best places in the world to research and develop exciting new medicines for hard-to-treat diseases, but needs to improve when it comes to manufacturing and packaging them ready to go to patients.\u201d GlaxoSmithKline, Britain\u2019s biggest drugmaker, recently said it would scale back its presence in Britain, the first major move by the company\u2019s new chief executive, Emma Walmsle. The firm said it would sell its Horlicks UK brand, shut the Slough factory where the malt drink is made, ditch plans for a new biopharmaceutical factory in Cumbria, and outsource some manufacturing from its Worthing site in West Sussex, with the loss of 320 jobs in Britain. AstraZeneca has moved all its research and development from the Alderley Park laboratories in Macclesfield to Cambridge.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Many of the anti-austerity policies that have led to a revival of Portugal\u2019s economy (The lie is nailed \u2013 there is an alternative to austerity, 24 August) did not actually originate from the Socialist government, but from conditions set by radical leftwing and green parties to enable the Socialists to govern after they failed to win a majority in the 2015 national elections. Among demands by the Communists, Left Bloc and Greens were the reversal of privatisation, a swift elimination of salary and pension cuts, and a substantial increase in the national minimum wage. These were mostly accepted by the Socialists, who went on to form a minority administration that relies on support from the radical left in parliament. Portugal\u2019s proportional electoral system is a key reason this anti-austerity grouping was able to happen, because it gives smaller parties seats in parliament. If Portugal used Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post system, it would instead be governed by the rightwing Portugal Ahead party, which won the most seats in parliament and would almost certainly be continuing the stringent cuts it had previously been implementing. The lesson from Portugal is not just that breaking with austerity is good for the economy, but that a more democratic electoral system provides the basis for challenging the mantra of \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d by giving a stronger voice to a wider range of political views. If Britain used proportional representation, we would not simply be relieved that Labour did better than expected in June\u2019s general election but would be potentially experiencing our own anti-austerity economic revival from a Labour-led minority government in partnership with smaller progressive parties. Dee Searle London \u2022 Owen Jones praises Ant\u00f3nio Costa\u2019s Socialist government in Portugal for reversing two years of EU- and IMF-enforced austerity. Rightly so. Before Costa took power a year ago, most of the important austerity measures had been enacted. Portugal was ready for a change of direction. This made good economic sense and it seems to be working. The example of Greece, however, shows that political perspectives alone don\u2019t cut it. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s leftwing party took over a country that had struggled for four years to reform, against an intransigent body of cartels, unions and government employees. The light was beginning to shine when Syriza took over. Against their promise to relax austerity, they carried on passing austerity measures in parliament, but in practice ignored their own laws. In fact many were reversed. None of the key measures needed were respected. The same group of unions, cartels, politicians and government officers has made sure of that. Has employing more civil servants, or refusing to privatise or reform key industries, helped the Greek crisis? Clearly not, as we face further borrowings. Economists deal with theories. Politicians ditto. If only life were that simple. The problems of longstanding mismanagement defy an austerity versus social spending solution. Left versus right political thinking doesn\u2019t help. Someone has to have the courage to face the tangled knots of corruption and entitlement that are strangling Greece. Simple answers from Portugal are simply no answer. Elspeth Geronimos Athens, Greece \u2022 Owen Jones is right to cite the example of Portugal to demonstrate that austerity is a political choice rather than an economic necessity. But there are other relevant instances. Britain\u2019s economy shrank during the traumatic first and second quarters of 2009. But under the guidance of Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling there followed no fewer than five quarters of economic growth from Q3 of 2009 to Q3 of 2010. The UK economy was recovering swiftly from the crisis. Then Cameron and Osborne slammed on the brakes and growth ground to a halt. In January 2009 the German government under Angela Merkel approved a \u20ac50bn economic stimulus plan. Germany exited the recession in the second and third quarters of 2009. The most successful economy in Europe turned its back firmly on austerity. David Butler London \u2022 Owen Jones could have included Iceland in his roundup of successful post-austerity economies (austerity: never anything other than the ruthless tactic of the Chicago School shock doctrine and the 1% it enriches). Don\u2019t suppose Owen\u2019s evidence might convince Labour\u2019s reluctant wing that the party can now not only be trusted with the economy but is even electable, and so worthy of their wholehearted support?

    "webTitle": "Should the rich be taxed more? A new paper shows unequivocally yes | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Denis Healey never actually said he intended to squeeze the rich until the pips squeaked. The man who would soon be Labour chancellor was referring solely to property speculators when he made the remark during the February 1974 election campaign. But the rich knew full well that Healey was coming for them, too. At the previous year\u2019s Labour party conference, he said: \u201cWe shall increase income tax on the better off so that we can help the hundreds of thousands of families now tangled helplessly in the poverty trap, by raising the tax threshold and introducing reduced rates of tax for those at the bottom of the ladder. I warn you, there are going to be howls of anguish from the rich. But before you cheer too loudly, let me warn you that a lot of you will pay extra taxes, too.\u201d Healey was as good as his word, with the top rate of income tax set at 83%. By contrast, the manifesto pledges outlined by John McDonnell, the current shadow chancellor, were modest. Under a Jeremy Corbyn government, someone earning around \u00a3125,000 or more would have been eligible for a new 50% income tax bracket and there would have been a 45% rate for people on more than \u00a380,000. Still, this is a different age. The abiding principle is that we should cut the rich some slack because the tax system needs them. Reducing tax rates for the better off is supposed to lead to a higher tax take by stimulating entrepreneurship and making the super-rich work harder. For those who don\u2019t believe this neoliberal fairytale, there is a fall-back position: the top 1% pay a lot more than 1% of tax receipts \u2013 and the proportion has been rising. The top 1% of earners in the UK accounts for 27% of income tax receipts, more than double the percentage when Healey was at the Treasury. So, stop grumbling, we\u2019re told. Without the sacrifices being made by those at the top, the cuts would be even deeper. This, though, is not the watertight case for the defence of the rich that it appears at first sight, as is demonstrated by a new paper from John Hatgioannides of the Cass business school, Marika Karanassou of Queen Mary University and Hector Sala of the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona and IZA in Bonn. The trio accept that in \u201can absolute, dry, sense\u201d the rich are supporting the tax system more than any other group, but say this tells only half the story. The past four decades have been extremely kind to those at the top. They have seen their incomes grow faster than the rest of the population and hold a far bigger share of wealth in the form of property and financial investments than the rest of the population. Over the years a bigger slice of national income has gone to capital at the expense of labour, and the rich have been the beneficiaries of that, because they are more likely to own shares and expensive houses. The trend has been particularly strong in the US, where labour\u2019s share of income has fallen from a recent peak of 57% at the end of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency to 53% by 2015. The Gini coefficient \u2013 a measure of inequality \u2013 has been steadily rising since 1970 and is now at levels normally seen in developing rather than advanced economies. Hatgioannides, Karanassou and Sala seek to take account of these profound changes in the distribution of income and wealth. They do so by dividing the average income tax rate of a particular slice of the US population by the percentage of national income commanded by that same group and by their share of wealth. They then look at whether by this measure \u2013 the fiscal inequality coefficient \u2013 the US tax system has become more or less progressive over time. The findings show quite clearly that it has become less progressive. In terms of income, the poorest 99% of the US population paid nine times as much income tax as the richest 1%, both when John F Kennedy was president in the early 1960s and when Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter in the 1980 race for the White House. By 2014, they paid 21 times as much. Similarly, the bottom 99.9% in the US paid 28 times as much tax as the elite 0.1% in the early 1960s and the early 1980s, but by 2014 they were paying 76 times as much. The same trend applies \u2013 although it is not pronounced \u2013 when income tax is divided by the share of wealth. The bottom 99% paid 22 times as much income tax as the wealthiest 1% in 1980 but were paying 47 times as much in 2014. The bottom 99.9% paid 58 times as much income tax as the top 0.1% before the onset of Reaganomics; by 2014 they were paying 175 times as much. The paper\u2019s research does not extend to Britain, although given that the distribution of income and wealth has also been tilted in favour of the rich and the very rich, a similar picture would almost certainly emerge. As the authors note, since 1980, economic policy making has been dominated by the idea that deregulation, less generous welfare and tax cuts will stimulate higher investment, higher productivity, higher growth and higher living standards for all. None of this has occurred and, what\u2019s more, the social mobility in the decades after the second world war has been thrown into reverse. The great American dream \u2013 the notion that anybody can strike it rich \u2013 is dead. Even so, the main beneficiaries of Donald Trump\u2019s tax plan \u2013 assuming he is able to get it through Congress \u2013 will be big corporations and the highest earners. Any suggestion that this is entirely the wrong approach is met by three arguments. The first is that the call for the rich to pay more is simply the politics of envy. The second is that it would be a return to the bad old days. The third is that the rich would find ways of avoiding paying any more. Yet Hatgioannides, Karanassou and Sala show there is a reason for the bulk of taxpayers to be unhappy about the way the system is loaded against them. What\u2019s more, for the average US worker, the bad old days weren\u2019t really so bad. Finally, saying that the rich would never pay up is defeatist; tax loopholes could be closed, tax havens shut down, wealth \u2013 especially in the form of immovable land \u2013 could be taxed rather than income. The argument that we should all be grateful to the ultra-rich is bunkum. As the paper concludes: \u201cThe overarching policy question is the following: in the current era of fiscal consolidation, should the rich be taxed more? Our evidence suggests unequivocally yes.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Denis Healey never actually said he intended to squeeze the rich until the pips squeaked. The man who would soon be Labour chancellor was referring solely to property speculators when he made the remark during the February 1974 election campaign.</p> <p>But the rich knew full well that Healey was coming for them, too. At the previous year\u2019s Labour party conference, he said: \u201cWe shall increase income tax on the better off so that we can help the hundreds of thousands of families now tangled helplessly in the poverty trap, by raising the tax threshold and introducing reduced rates of tax for those at the bottom of the ladder. I warn you, there are going to be howls of anguish from the rich. But before you cheer too loudly, let me warn you that a lot of you will pay extra taxes, too.\u201d</p> <p>Healey was as good as his word, with the top rate of income tax set at 83%. By contrast, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/16/labour-manifesto-analysis-key-points-pledges\">manifesto pledges outlined by John McDonnell, the current shadow chancellor, were modest</a>. Under a Jeremy Corbyn government, someone earning around \u00a3125,000 or more would have been eligible for a new 50% income tax bracket and there would have been a 45% rate for people on more than \u00a380,000.</p> <p>Still, this is a different age. The abiding principle is that we should cut the rich some slack because the tax system needs them. Reducing tax rates for the better off is supposed to lead to a higher tax take by stimulating entrepreneurship and making the super-rich work harder. For those who don\u2019t believe this neoliberal fairytale, there is a fall-back position: the top 1% pay a lot more than 1% of tax receipts \u2013 and the proportion has been rising. The top 1% of earners in the UK accounts for 27% of income tax receipts, more than double the percentage when Healey was at the Treasury. So, stop grumbling, we\u2019re told. Without the sacrifices being made by those at the top, the cuts would be even deeper.</p> <p>This, though, is not the watertight case for the defence of the rich that it appears at first sight, as is demonstrated by <a href=\"http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/18086/\">a new paper from John Hatgioannides of the Cass business school, Marika Karanassou of Queen Mary University and Hector Sala of the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona and IZA in Bonn</a>.</p> <p>The trio accept that in \u201can absolute, dry, sense\u201d the rich are supporting the tax system more than any other group, but say this tells only half the story. The past four decades have been extremely kind to those at the top. They have seen their incomes grow faster than the rest of the population and hold a far bigger share of wealth in the form of property and financial investments than the rest of the population. Over the years a bigger slice of national income has gone to capital at the expense of labour, and the rich have been the beneficiaries of that, because they are more likely to own shares and expensive houses.<br></p> <p>The trend has been particularly strong in the US, where labour\u2019s share of income has fallen from a recent peak of 57% at the end of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency to 53% by 2015. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/datablog/2017/apr/26/inequality-index-where-are-the-worlds-most-unequal-countries\">Gini coefficient</a> \u2013 a measure of inequality \u2013 has been steadily rising since 1970 and is now at levels normally seen in developing rather than advanced economies.</p> <p>Hatgioannides, Karanassou and Sala seek to take account of these profound changes in the distribution of income and wealth.

      "bodyText": "When I referred in my last column to Chancellor Philip Hammond as the only grown-up minister in this chaotic cabinet, I was unaware that he had just put his name to a joint article in the pro-Brexit Sunday Telegraph with his arch-foe Liam Fox, making the following statement: \u201cWe respect the will of the British people \u2013 in March 2019 the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. We will leave the customs union\u2026 we will leave the single market\u2026 \u201d True, this was followed by reports that he wanted, in effect, to retain quasi-membership for several years, but the two emphasised that such a precaution \u201ccannot be a back door to staying in the EU\u201d. There were also reports that Hammond had in some mysterious way scored a victory, which contrasted vividly with other reports that his attempt at some kind of coup had been foiled. Certainly, what he put his name to in that article was not good news for those of us who firmly believe it is not too late to arrest the progress of Brexit in its tracks. But then the shenanigans in the present cabinet\u2019s approach to Brexit negotiations call to mind the Queen in Through the looking-glass telling Alice: \u201cSometimes I\u2019ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\u201d The fact of the matter is that this government is so unstable that anything could happen in the next two months. It is an open secret that up to half a dozen members of the cabinet, and at least one double-breasted outsider, are metaphorically polishing their daggers. As my colleague Andrew Rawnsley has pointed out, the only thing holding up a revolt against Theresa May is fear that, by precipitating yet another election, the assassins might end up with Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street. But Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cvaulting ambition\u201d is a powerful factor in politics, and there are those who wonder how Theresa May can survive the party conference in October unscathed. Which brings us to the Labour party\u2019s position on Brexit, which most people seem to regard as every bit as confused as the Conservative one. It is generally assumed that the problem with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s lukewarm opposition to Brexit during the referendum was that he is a lifelong Eurosceptic and thinks the EU is a capitalist conspiracy against workers. But most enlightened Labour MPs and trade unionists are more aware than Corbyn seems to be that the EU is in fact very strong on workers\u2019 rights. As for Corbyn\u2019s apparent fear that the EU is the enemy of publicly owned corporations, he must surely be aware of the degree to which so many of our so-called \u201cprivatised\u201d utilities and much of our transport network are already in the hands of continental state-owned concerns. It seems to me that Labour now has a golden opportunity to capitalise on the strong pro-European feelings of the young, as manifested in recent surveys and, indeed, in the last election. In which context, there was a powerful open letter not long ago to Corbyn in his (and my) local paper, the Islington Tribune, from a longtime Labour party member, Michael Wolff. He told Corbyn: \u201cDespite your current popularity, your ambiguity about the EU and that sense that you are out of step with our nation\u2019s youth on Brexit won\u2019t keep the momentum you\u2019ve created rolling in your favour.\u201d The message was epitomised in the headline: \u201cMy message to Jeremy: Don\u2019t let our young people down, burst the Brexit bubble.\u201d For those of us who care more about this nation than the Brexiters, the situation is urgent. Professor Vernon Bogdanor at King\u2019s College, London, maintains that Labour\u2019s electoral gains in June \u201craise the question of whether the decision in the 2016 referendum is final: for, although Labour was not a Remain party this year, the British Election Study found that the party\u2019s \u2018soft Brexit\u2019 policy played a large part in its substantial gain in votes. In constituencies where over 55% voted Remain, the party achieved a swing of around 7%.\u201d Bogdanor concludes that \u201cthe election was the revenge of the Remainers\u201d. The state of our nation is pitiful enough without the addition of self-inflicted damage. The hospitals, the care homes, the rail service \u2013 too many services are, to adapt May\u2019s phrase, \u201cjust about managing\u201d. This is bad enough, but the economy has slowed down as well: as the economist Simon Wren-Lewis points out, the slowdown was at first aggravated in 2015 and 2016 by the continuing austerity policy, but more recently has been hit by the impact on real incomes of the Brexit-induced devaluation of the pound. Now, in theory one of the few benefits of that depreciation should have been a rebalancing towards exports, and some surveys suggest that export orders are rising. But, as Wren-Lewis says, so far the depreciation \u201chas not led to any compensating increase in exports because firms are not going to expand markets that might soon disappear because of leaving the single market or customs union\u201d. We are coming up to the 50th anniversary of the devaluation of the pound under Harold Wilson in 1967. Then as now, commentators worried that for a long time the trade balance was not improving. Then they discovered the \u201cJ-curve\u201d \u2013 the immediate effect had been to worsen the balance of payments by making imports dearer and exports cheaper. But eventually the improvement in price competitiveness led to a better trade performance. But I am with Wren-Lewis: this time, any J-curve effects are likely to be offset by the deleterious impact of Brexit if our political leaders do not have the gumption to tell the electorate it made a grave mistake in last year\u2019s referendum. Time to think again! \u2022 This article was amended on 31 August 2017 to correct a quotation about Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice and her adventures.",

Even the watchdog wants you to make a PPI claim For anyone who hasn\u2019t had enough of phone calls offering untold riches via compensation for mis-sold PPI, now the campaign is hitting the TV, radio and billboards. In this case though, it won\u2019t be bogus cold calls but advice from reputable City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority.

The big four lenders \u2013 HSBC, Barclays, RBS and Lloyds \u2013 have about \u00a36.5bn set aside between them. The scandal proved to be bigger than anyone expected. When it emerged, regulators estimated about 3 million people had been affected. That has since snowballed to 12 million, who have so far received more than \u00a327.4bn. By launching a national campaign, the FCA hopes it can winnow out the last remaining claimants and get their money back \u2013 something that will also allow the banks to draw a line under the whole sorry affair. All bets off if bookes lose cash cow GVC, owner of betting brands such as bwin and Sportingbet, has been sidling up to Ladbrokes like a prime racing stud eyeing a comely mare.

Analysts now think another round of consolidation is on the cards. GVC has confirmed that it spoke to Ladbrokes about a deal worth up to \u00a33.6bn, but talks broke down. The prospect of a revived deal is sure to capture attention next week when Ladbrokes posts half-year results.

Analysts at Barclays think a \u00a32 maximum stake on FOBTs would see Ladbrokes forfeit \u00a3450m in lost revenues, so GVC\u2019s logic looks sound.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Central bankers were back in the spotlight this weekend as some of the biggest names gathered in the US ski resort of Jackson Hole. Investors were hopeful of a sign from Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, to illuminate the future path of interest rates in their respective jurisdictions. Yellen is under pressure to talk up the strength of the US economy and worry out loud about the threat of inflation. This would be seen as a proxy for saying that interest rate rises will resume soon. Financial traders want Draghi to be more explicit about when he will stop pumping money into the eurozone economy. They understand that interest rates are unlikely to nudge upwards, but believe it is reasonable for him to say when the ECB expects to ease back on the current policy, which amounts to \u20ac60bn of quantitative easing a month, and allow their City clients to plan their investments. Little was said to startle the trading community. Yellen was more concerned with rebutting Republican claims that financial regulation was holding back growth. Draghi talked obliquely and left no one any the wiser. Most observers were already aware that the conference in Wyoming was a holding operation. That\u2019s why the heads of many major central banks were absent, including Bank of England governor Mark Carney. But the level of anticipation was still great, and illustrated a disturbingly high level of anxiety around the smallest changes in interest rates. Unfortunately this is an almost daily feature of the stock and bond markets, which have given up on governments of any colour doing something significant to boost investment and growth. There was a flurry of excitement when Donald Trump was elected president on a platform of steep tax cuts and infrastructure spending commitments. Markets raced ahead as Trump talked about 3%-plus growth in perpetuity, or at least for the majority of his presidency. That euphoria soon dissipated as Trump found himself mired in rows with Congress over Obamacare and, more recently, the prospect of a shutdown of the federal government as Congressional rules prevent Washington borrowing more money \u2013 the so-called debt ceiling. Investors saw that the global economy would continue to rely for growth on consumer spending spurred by cheap central bank money. This is the new normal, and underpins why the majority of central banks are cutting rates at the moment, not raising them. Indonesia is among those to have cut their main interest rate. Likewise Brazil and Hungary. Some countries have increased rates, but the balance is with the cutters. This all goes to show that every country these days needs low rates to keep its economy moving. But as the 2008 financial crash illustrated, plentiful credit is a dangerous route to growth. In the end, banks lend to people and businesses that cannot repay \u2013 and the system falls over. The answer must be for governments to take centre stage and shove the central bankers bank into the wings. The forum for this should be the G20, which is the most inclusive and representation international grouping that is not so unwieldy that it cannot make decisions. G20 leaders gathered in Hamburg last month to no great effect. All the talk was of Trump\u2019s private meetings with Russia leader Vladimir Putin, and protests on the city\u2019s streets against globalisation. It was one of several missed opportunities for Chinese president Xi Jingping, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who sat with the other 16 national leaders and European Union representative Jean-Claude Juncker, to call for an end to beggar-thy-neighbour policymaking. It just leaves every country reluctant to take on the burden of investment by itself. Instead, they prefer the invisible hand of the central bank, and spending is funded by debt, not tax receipts. If Trump won\u2019t play ball, they should continue without him, as they did when he quit the COP20 climate deal. Otherwise another crash looms. Action on betting is vital For British bookmakers, waiting for the government\u2019s review into the gambling industry must feel like watching a roulette wheel slowly come to a halt. Due in early summer but shelved until October, the review could be an inflection point for gambling regulation. Focus on problem gambling is sharper than ever after last week\u2019s report by the Gambling Commission, which concluded that the government and the industry were not doing enough to tackle it. One key finding is that the number of addicts who play fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) \u2013 the controversial machines that let punters stake \u00a3100 every 20 seconds \u2013 has increased significantly. Public anger about FOBTs has grown and, while the Treasury fears that curbing the machines could diminish its tax take, No 11\u2019s voice may be drowned out by the prospect of an easy political win. The review\u2019s verdict on gambling advertising, which has ballooned in recent years, will be just as significant. As it stands, ads such as those featuring Ray Winstone\u2019s disembodied head urging punters to \u201cbet now!\u201d (responsibly) can\u2019t appear before the 9pm watershed except during a live sports event. Given the sheer volume of televised sport, it is an exception that renders the rule all but useless. Again, the government will face intense lobbying \u2013 those ads are hugely lucrative for broadcasters. However, important as the review is, it distracts from a less visible but larger problem: the lack of resources for treating addicts. While counselling organisations such as GamCare and YGAM do great work, specialist treatment in the UK is woefully thin on the ground. There is just one gambling addiction clinic in the UK, in London and funded by the GambleAware charity. It has a six-month waiting list. Gambling is not afforded the same priority as alcoholism or drug addiction within Public Health England. Improving treatment should now attract as much focus as clipping the gambling industry\u2019s wings. Workers still locked out of the boardroom Greg Clark is going to disappoint millions of workers this week when his white paper on corporate governance is published. Clark is one of the cabinet\u2019s more thoughtful characters. As business secretary, he has impressed executives with his grasp of the subject and steady approach. Yet this will count for little on the shopfloor when he confirms that Theresa May\u2019s proposal of a place for workers\u2019 representatives on the board has bitten the dust. Bosses will get to choose between designating a non-exec to represent workers, nominating a director from the workforce, or establishing an advisory council. This will have \u201caccess\u201d to board members, according to Whitehall leaks. The government is also expected to abandon a proposal to \u201clegislate to make executive pay packages subject to strict annual votes by shareholders\u201d. Clark will say that, in the round, his reforms make big business more accountable: but without direct access, workers remain on the sidelines.",
