The coffee chain faced a backlash from customers when it emerged last month they had received \u00a33bn in sales over 14 years yet claimed to have made a loss in Britain each year, vastly reducing its corporation tax bill. The campaign group UK Uncut has organised 45 protests to pressurise the government to clamp down on tax avoidance and roll back cuts to public services. A UK Uncut spokesperson, Anna Walker, said that 1,000 people attended 45 sit-ins across the country. At Starbucks' flagship store on Conduit Street in central London about 40 activists and six children were threatened by police with arrest for aggravated trespass and \u2013 after a brief discussion \u2013 the protesters agreed to leave.
