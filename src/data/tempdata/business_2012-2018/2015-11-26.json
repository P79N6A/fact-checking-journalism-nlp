      "bodyText": "This year\u2019s Christmas dinner will be the cheapest since 2011 \u2013 thanks partly to President Putin and democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Families will pay an average 1% less for a turkey dinner this festive season after a slump in the prices of pork and potatoes on the commodity markets, according to experts at Mintec. The price of British pork \u2013 vital for stuffing and Christmas garnishes such as pigs in blankets \u2013 is 13% down on this time last year, its lowest level since May 2008, as a Russian ban on imports led to prices falling across Europe, putting pressure on British farmers who have had to cut their own prices to stay competitive. Prices have also been hit by lower demand from Hong Kong importers \u2013 where protests and government crackdowns have led to economic problems. Potato prices are 8% lower than last year as a result of warm weather in the early autumn. Christmas crackers should also be cheaper as a result of falling prices for virgin pulp and recovered paper \u2013 important elements in Christmas crackers. Both have been on a downward trend in 2015 with virgin pulp prices down by 11% and recovered by 4% year on year. The price declines in those key elements of Christmas more than offset price rises elsewhere on the festive table. There\u2019s particularly bad news for chocoholics: the price of chocolate is up as a result of cocoa powder and cocoa butter prices rising 30% and 11% respectively. Mintec says lower production in the main growing regions, as well as weather problems delaying the current harvest, have contributed to the price increases. Turkeys \u2013 the centrepiece of most Christmas dinners \u2013 are also about 1% more expensive than last year, because of high demand. Average prices for carrots, onions and parsnips have risen by an average 10%, according to Mintec. It doesn\u2019t include brussels sprouts in its Christmas dinner price survey, but points out prices are up 7% compared to last year as farmers have reduced the amount of space they devote to the green vegetables. Mintec\u2019s analysis runs counter to the claims of supermarkets, which say they have been cutting the price of fresh fruit and vegetables as they try and fight off competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. The two German chains have dramatically increased the amount of fresh food they offer, leading to price wars on basics such as cucumbers, where the average price is now less than 50p compared to up to 90p a few years ago. There have also been recent reports of a bumper sprout harvest in the UK \u2013 as the unusually warm autumn weather has made them bigger than ever.",

Whiplash, in many instances, has become a racket in which too many outfits \u2013 claim management firms, repair garages and car rental firms, not just lawyers \u2013 have an interest.

    "webTitle": "Spending review will still leave poor families worse off, say experts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has been forced to deny claims that George Osborne\u2019s spending review is a continued assault on Britain\u2019s poorest families, after two respected thinktanks warned future benefit cuts would leave some families more than a thousand pounds worse off. Both the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation said they believe millions of working families would be worse off by 2020 because of welfare changes than they would have been under the current system, despite Osborne having reversed his planned cuts to tax credits. In its analysis of the autumn statement and spending review, the IFS said other commentators had been wrong to describe the chancellor\u2019s measures as an end to austerity. The IFS director, Paul Johnson, said: \u201cThis is not the end of austerity. This spending review is still one of the tightest in post-war history.\u201d Some 2.6 million working families stood to lose an average \u00a31,600 as a result of benefit changes due to come into force under the universal credit system, while 1.9 million would be better off by \u00a31,400, the IFS noted. It stressed that no family will take an immediate cash hit, but the \u201clong term generosity of the welfare system will be cut just as much as was ever intended, as new claimants will receive significantly lower benefits than they would have done before the July changes\u201d. The thinktank also cast doubt over Osborne\u2019s target of running a surplus on the public finances by the end of the decade, and warned that there was a 50-50 chance he would be forced to revisit his plans. At the IFS\u2019s traditional postmortem into the chancellor\u2019s budget decisions, Johnson said: \u201cHe is going to need his luck to hold out. He has set himself a completely inflexible target \u2013 to have a surplus in 2019-20.\u201d He warned Osborne will be forced to raise taxes or announce more spending cuts if the brighter picture of the public finances presented at the autumn statement proves to be unfounded. The IFS\u2019s verdict on benefit cuts was backed up an analysis by the Resolution Foundation, which said poorer families will still be hit as universal credit is rolled out. Cuts to universal credit \u2013 the benefit set to replace tax credits for most claimants in the last years of the parliament \u2013 are to go ahead. That decision will cost working households \u00a31,000 on average in 2020 and the losses could rise to \u00a33,000 for some families, the Resolution Foundation said. However, the Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions hit back at the independent studies, saying it was \u201ccompletely misleading\u201d to suggest families would lose money. The government does not deny that in-work payments replacing tax credits will be lower for some new claimants, including those whose family circumstances change. However, the Treasury claimed it was \u201cnot legitimate\u201d to compare what someone making a new claim under universal credit in 2020 would get with what they would get under the current system. A spokesman said: \u201cAs the chancellor set out, for current tax credit claimants, because of the government\u2019s economic plan, we can now help with the transition to universal credit by avoiding changes to tax credits altogether. \u201cThis means there will be no losses in tax credits, and the suggestion that tax credit cuts have somehow been postponed or transferred into universal credit is completely misleading.\u201d Both thinktanks rejected the Treasury\u2019s criticism, saying that it was legitimate to compare an old system with a new system in order to estimate how families would fare in the future. \u201cIn the long run, people will be worse off under universal credit than they would have been if the current system continued,\u201d said IFS economist Stuart Adam, responding to the Treasury comments. A source close to work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith claimed the Resolution Foundation report was an example of scaremongering, as people will not see immediate cash losses to their welfare payments. The source said: \u201cIt is a static analysis that does not take into account behavioural change, or other changes such as the new childcare offer.\u201d She added the same applied to the IFS analysis, but highlighted its admission that no family will take an immediate cash hit and that people will be protected in cash terms. The IFS noted that total government spending was due to fall from 40.9% of national income in the last tax year to 36.5% by the end of the decade. As part of that, spending on non-pension benefits was being cut to the lowest level in 30 years relative to national income. The thinktank also pointed out that the government\u2019s commitment to health spending was tiny by historical standards. Johnson said: \u201cThe 3% cumulative increase in health spending over the next five years is not far off the average annual increase in spending in the last 50 years.\u201d Still, the IFS director said the scale of the chancellor\u2019s austerity drive was less than had been implied before May\u2019s election and again at an emergency budget in July. Johnson said: \u201cThere is no question that the cuts will be less severe than implied in July. The gap with what one might have expected, based on the Conservative manifesto, is substantially greater.\u201d Osborne announced a U-turn on his planned tax credit cuts and said he would spare frontline policing from severe austerity, in his combined autumn statement and spending review on Wednesday. The chancellor said he would continue to cut day-to-day government spending and the welfare budget to deliver an overall budget surplus of \u00a310.1bn by 2019-20. At the Resolution Foundation\u2019s analysis of the spending review, David Laws, who was a Liberal Democrat minister in the coalition government, said the chancellor now plans to lean far more heavily on tax increases than he expected before May\u2019s election \u2014 taking him closer to the balance favoured by former business secretary Vince Cable. He added that Osborne was too occupied with political point-scoring to carry out radical reform of the state. \u201cHe is spending an awful lot of time and money and capital shooting other people\u2019s foxes, rather than developing a strategy of his own,\u201d said Laws. David Willetts, former Conservative minister and the thinktank\u2019s executive chair, said Osborne\u2019s autumn statement, which softened the pace of departmental spending cuts, was a reversal of the usual pattern in which chancellors swing the axe more heavily once an election is out of the way. \u201cIn the old days, politicians used to promise milk and honey before the election and after the election you\u2019d get the bad news,\u201d he said. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, said the IFS analysis showed Osborne \u201chas not reversed his welfare cuts, he has just delayed them\u201d. \u201cThe day after the spending review the Tory spin is unravelling,\u201d he said. \u201cWe said this was a smoke and mirror spending review, and we were right.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our own Larry Elliott\u2019s take on today\u2019s IFS report: Napoleon would have approved of George Osborne. \u201cI know he\u2019s a good general\u201d, the French emperor once said. \u201cBut is he lucky?\u201d The answer to that question, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is yes. The chancellor got lucky when the Office for Budget Responsibility raised its forecasts for tax revenue and cut its predictions for interest payments on the national debt. That gave Osborne some much-needed wiggle room to delay welfare cuts, choke back on austerity and spend a bit more on infrastructure. The question posed by the UK\u2019s leading experts on the public finances is whether Osborne will stay lucky. He has set himself a cast-iron target \u2013 to run a budget surplus by the end of this parliament in 2020 \u2013 and if the OBR projections prove to be wrong he will face a simple choice: abandon the target, cut spending or raise taxes. Paul Johnson, the IFS\u2019s director, thinks the likeliest outcome would be that the chancellor would raise taxes \u2013 and the IFS analysis of the autumn statement and spending review shows why....... That\u2019s probably all for today. Goodnight and thanks for reading. GW The Office for Budget Responsibility has been attracting flak for its more optimistic fiscal forecasts. Some economists are concerned that the new projections - which gave the chancellor a welcome windfall which he rapidly spent - may be unrealistic. Chris Giles of the FT has the details: Some thought the OBR was too optimistic on revenues. Andrew Goodwin of Oxford Economics said the fiscal watchdog \u201cprovided the chancellor with an unexpected free pass\u201d on the public finances. He said the OBR had a history of optimism on tax revenues and \u201ctoday\u2019s forecast revisions move them even further towards the optimistic end of this scale\u201d. Fathom Consulting said the chancellor was paying for higher than expected public spending with \u201cnotional revenues\u201d, and Francois Cabau of Barclays said caution was required over the Autumn Statement details that \u201cthe bulk of the fiscal performance would be owing to improved tax receipts and a lower interest rate burden\u201d.... More here. And that\u2019s the end of the Institute for Fiscal Studies briefing. We\u2019ll have analysis later. But in the meantime you can scroll back to 1pm for the IFS\u2019s full verdict on George Osborne\u2019s plans. And remember, all their work is online here. Q: Will there be a two-tier benefit system as people are moved onto Universal Credit? Andrew Hood agrees that any system that introduces cuts for new claimants but protects existing ones creates a two-tier system. There is transitional protection, but expressed in cash terms, which means that people should not receive less under the new system (inflation, though, could erode that protection). Transitional protection can last a very long time, Paul Johnson adds. Q: And how can transitional protection be lost? Several ways: Acquiring or losing a partner loses protection. Losing off UC entirely - if one earns more than the maximum allowed in a week and no longer qualify. If my income falls, my UC entitlement doesn\u2019t rise, until I\u2019ve cleared the transitional protection. The IFS are helpfully uploading all their presentations, so you can see their work on the Autumn Statement and Spending Review. Sky\u2019s Ed Conway sums it up: Q: Is George Osborne right to spend the \u2018windfall\u2019 from the OBR\u2019s improved fiscal forecasts? Gemma Tetlow agrees that the chancellor\u2019s response is a little \u2018asymmetric\u2019 (as the chancellor could have banked the money and gunned for a more rapid fiscal consolidation). Paul Johnson gives the chancellor some (guarded) support -- saying the alternative would have been to press on and slash police spending, foreign spending, or hike taxes. It doesn\u2019t seem to me to be not wise to not implement massive spending cuts if you think you might not have to. Q: Is Iain Duncan Smith right when he says today that under the new Universal Credit system, people are moving into work faster and earning more than under the current? Paul Johnson declines to comment on the behaviour of the very small number of people already on UC; the IFS\u2019s work relates to the distributional impact when it is fully implemented. Onto questions. He says that the government overestimated the savings from the tax credit cuts, which is why the u-turn only yields \u00a33.4bn not the \u00a34.4bn expected. Q: What is the distributional impact of Universal credit system? The impact is complicated, and doesn\u2019t really match people\u2019s place on the income scale. Single earner couples tend to do well, while two income families and single parents do less well, Hood adds. The IFS has also crunched some numbers, showing how the universal credit system will change the benefit system: Universal credit vs. the system it is replacing UC now represents additional cut on top of other changes \u2013 Cuts benefit entitlements by \u00a33.7bn a year in the long run \u2013 Existing claimants protected in cash terms when moved onto UC 4.5m working families affected by introduction of UC \u2013 2.6m lose an average of \u00a31,600 a year \u2013 1.9m gain an average of \u00a31,400 a year \u2013 Total cut of \u00a31.5bn a year 1.8m non-working families affected by introduction of UC \u2013 1.2m lose an average of \u00a32,500 a year \u2013 0.6m gain an average of \u00a31,000 a year \u2013 Total cut of \u00a32.2bn a year The IFS\u2019s Andrew Hood is now hammering home the point that the benefit system will still be much less generous in the long term. He says: In the long run, the system will be much less generous to low income households. That\u2019s the big headline...because other cuts are going ahead This chart confirms that point - showing that the poorest families are actually losing slightly more in the long term than they were before. The tax-credit u-turn has \u201cno long-term effect\u201d, he insists. The government is still planning \u201cdeep cuts to working-age benefits\u201d, including to low-income working families. On average, the overall package will strengthen work incentives, Hood says. But there are still measures that will hurt low-paid workers, such as cuts to the work allowance: This, Hood says, is a very similar impact to the tax credit changes which have now been reversed. Abandoning the planned cuts to tax credits will cost \u00a33.4bn in the 2016-17 financial year, Andrew Hood explains - not the \u00a34.4bn expected. Andrew Hood of the IFS is now running through the latest welfare changes. The big picture is that: Government still planning \u00a312bn cut to annual benefit spending by end of the parliament \u2013 But less than half delivered by 2017-18 \u2013 \u00a34bn from freeze to 2020, \u00a34-5bn additional cuts to universal credit, \u00a311\u20442bn cuts to housing benefit spending (plus other smaller changes) Benefit spending excluding state pensions in 2020-21 forecast to be at its lowest as a share of national income for 30 years Giving councils full retention of business rates is \u2018genuinely revolutionary\u2019, David Phillips adds, and part of the government\u2019s devolution of powers: The IFS is also concerned about Osborne\u2019s plan to allow local councils to raise an extra 2% from residents, to fund social care in their area. The problem is that councils who already charge the highest bills can obviously raise more cash than an area with lower charges. Councils in \u201cleafy areas with high council tax and relatively low social care needs\u201d, such as Rutland, benefit most from this change, says the David Phillips, senior research economist at the IFS. It is also \u201cvery tricky\u201d to see how central government can make sure that extra funds are devoted to social care. The iFS is now outlining the huge funding cuts which local government\u2019s now face. If they keep cutting grants in line with the existing formula, then councils who have already taken the biggest hit will suffer the most. Reminder, you can watch the IFS briefing online here. Here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s news story on the Institute for Fiscal Studies new report: It won\u2019t have escaped anyone\u2019s notice that George Osborne blew through his welfare cap yesterday, Gemma Tetlow deadpans. She reminds us that the OBR expects the government to breach the cap three years running. Reclassifications in funding sources means the government will just hit its cap in the following two years, Tetlow adds, suggesting that such \u2018reclassifications\u2019 need to be scrutinised closely to ensure the government doesn\u2019t fudge this issue. George Osborne has slightly eased the pace of fiscal consolidation, Tetlow explains. As this chart shows, the UK is on track to reach the same point, but more slowly. There\u2019s a slight change to the \u2018mix\u2019 - tax rises now makes up 17%, up from 16%. But it\u2019s still mainly dependent on welfare cuts. The only non-protected department to avoid the squeeze this time is defence, Gemma Tetlow adds - last time it took a big cut, this time its seen its budget rise (to address new security concerns) Despite the lower spending cuts, it won\u2019t be an easy ride of the next few years, Tetlow continues. And this chart shows where the axe has fallen hardest - including Transport, and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Osborne\u2019s new stamp duty levy on new second homes and buy-to-let properties will he hard to implement, Gemma Tetlow suggests. Someone could, for example, buy a house, live in it for a bit [thus avoiding the levy], and then rent it out. The Apprenticeship levy (which has annoyed businesses) is better than the plan originally proposed by the government, Tetlow says: It will only affect the largest 2% of companies - and is a tax on the earnings of large firms (they get vouchers, which can then be redeemed if they actually train some workers). The OBR have trimmed their growth forecast, to recognise the impact on large firms, says Tetlow. She also suggests that firms could be tempted into \u2018relabelling\u2019 existing projects to qualify, rather than taking on more apprentiships. May relabeling Gemma Tetlow of the IFS is explaining how Osborne benefitted from various positive forecasting changes. The overall effect was to strengthen the public finances by around \u00a34bn in the medium term. This slide shows the details: There are \u2018big distributional effects\u2019 from the cuts in funding from central government to local government, Johnson says. Changes to the business rate system, allowing local authorities to retain growth in revenue, is a \u201cgenuinely big change\u201d. It means councils will be more dependent than ever on the economic performance in their area. Paul Johnson is adamant that the chancellor isn\u2019t suddenly being more generous to the poor: \u201cThe long term generosity of the welfare system will be cut just as much as was ever intended\u201d On the tax credits u-turn, Paul Johnson says there is no net change in the long run - because Universal Credit is already legislated to replace current benefits. He confirms that 2.6m families will be worse off under UC, losing around \u00a31,600 each. But another 1.9m households will be better off. Johnson warns that housing associations are facing particularly deep cuts to their grants, around 40% in 2017. George Osborne has set himself an inflexible target, to achieve a surplus this parliament, Paul Johnson continues. And there\u2019s only a 50:50 chance that he\u2019ll achieve it. If he fails - perhaps because the Office for Budget forecasts are too optimistic - then the chancellor faces three choices; revise spending, raise taxes, or abandon the surplus target. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS is introducing its analysis now (here\u2019s the livefeed) He says that the government is now aiming to cut spending at non-protected departments by around 18%, compared to around 27% previously. Johnson says: Contrary to some headlines this morning, this is absolutely not the end of austerity.... This spending review is still one of the tightest on record. Maybe not as bad as 2010, but that\u2019s a pretty high bar. Par example: But it\u2019s also true that the cuts are less severe than outlined in the last budget, Johnson adds. The IFS is also warning that - despite scrapping tax credits cuts - George Osborne\u2019s plan still means reducing non-pension benefits to their lowest level as a share of national income for 30 years. Here\u2019s the first newsline from the IFS, via the Press Association: Around 2.6 million working families will be an average 1,600 a year worse off as a result of benefit changes confirmed in Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s Spending Review, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found. The Institute for Fiscal Studies is releasing its analysis of the Spending Review now, at Senate House in London. Apparently they let the chancellor loose on an actual new house.... The Institute for Fiscal Studies gives its verdict on the Autumn Statement in around 40 minutes time - it will be live-streamed here. Some of today\u2019s newspapers claim that Osborne unveiled \u2018the end of austerity\u2019. The Daily Mail sounds positively cross about it (like most things.....): It\u2019s true that Osborne has loosened the pace of cuts. But there are still chunky cuts to public spending, an increase in tax receipts, and a commitment to a surplus by 2020. Plus significant welfare cuts. And that\u2019s why Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, believes the age of austerity isn\u2019t over. German bank Berenberg is predicting that George Osborne will not achieve the cuts outlined yesterday. Their economist, Kallum Pickering, says: George Osborne has set a precedent in the last five years that he won\u2019t break over the next five years. He makes promises for cuts that he never quite gets around to. This is good news for the economy today, but a risk for tomorrow. This chart shows how the UK has consistently borrowed more than predicted: Pickering also reckons it will be \u201cimpossible\u201d to cut day-to-day spending as deeply as targeted. In our view, the plan to bring the deficit down by reductions in day to day spending is not feasible. This year, total government spending will be a little over 40% of GDP. The Government is targeting to reduce this total to around 35% of GDP by 2020. This will be the lowest level since 2000 and even below the Thatcher years... We may need George Osborne\u2019s brick-laying skills -- his plan to build 400,000 new homes could founder if enough trained builders can\u2019t be found. It may also bring little short-term help to renters. Frank Nash, partner at chartered accountants Blick Rothenberg, explains: \u201cThe chancellor has openly admitted that more affordable housing, including the private sector, needs to come forward to allow people to become owner occupiers and achieve their aspirations. However, it will take at least five years and, until those homes are built, young families have no choice but to rent. \u201cThe problem is that until these new homes are built, private rented property is price inelastic. Landlords need to protect their investment and are expected to pass the cost on in the form of higher rent. This reduces a tenant\u2019s ability to save a deposit for a home of their own, and in turn their ability to make best use of the range of the Help-to-Buy initiatives.\u201d Nash also fears that the new 3% stamp duty levy on second-home and Buy-to-Let landlords could rebound, and be passed onto renters. There\u2019s something slightly clich\u00e9d and unconvincing about politicians tromping around building sites.... ..but at least George Osborne has been learning some new skills. George Osborne has already warned that he won\u2019t shy away from \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d. The chancellor has spent this morning defending criticism of his autumn statement -- and claims that he\u2019s abandoned austerity by committing to spend his \u00a327bn fiscal windfall. He also declined to apologise or to admit a blunged over the tax credits u-turn, as we report here: Asked by the Today presenter Nick Robinson whether he was admitting he had made a mistake and was apologising or whether he had simply been forced to change tack by critics, the chancellor said that his \u201ccentral judgment\u201d to move to a lower welfare and higher wage economy was the right one. Torsten Bell, the Resolution Foundation\u2019s director, is adamant that George Osborne\u2019s spending review decisions hit the poor but spare the rich. That\u2019s because long-term welfare changes are still in force -- so as Universal Credit is rolled out, millions more people will be hit. Bell says: The most damaging changes are to universal credit, the government\u2019s flagship welfare programme which is at serious risk of being undermined. For working households with children on universal credit the average loss with be \u00a31,300 in 2020. These changes will also increase the risk of people being trapped in low-paid short-hours work. Universal credit replaces a set of other benefits, and is already being piloted - as Ashwin Kumar, director of Liverpool Economics, explains: Those hit hardest by the new universal credit rules will be lone parents, disabled people and couples with children who rent their home rather than have a mortgage. Currently, the rules allow lone parents \u00a38,800 a year in earnings before their universal credit starts to get reduced. From April that figure will drop to \u00a34,800. The Resolution Foundation are continuing to kick the tires of the autumn statements. The think tank is warning that George Osborne has slipped out significant tax rises, on top of the surprise \u00a327bn pick-up in the public finances from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. It is also reiterating its concerns that poor families will still be hit, as the universal credit is implemented in five years (meaning the tax-credit u-turn is only temporary) The chart we ran earlier in the blog shows how the poorest are worst hit by tax and benefit changes this parliament. According to the Resolution Foundation, the move to universal credit will cost working households \u00a31,000 on average in 2020. Executive chair David Willetts (a former Tory minister), is also struck by how Osborne\u2019s austerity drive has softened, compared to the pre-election budget in March: Former Liberal Democrat MP David Laws is also unimpressed: Katie Martin of the Financial Times has a good take on this morning\u2019s Barclays fine. Here\u2019s a flavour: Barclays and the troublesome \u2018elephant deal\u2019 The \u00a372m fine just meted out to Barclays over poor checks on certain very wealthy clients refers to a \u00a31.88bn transaction that the bank described as an \u201celephant deal\u201d for which one senior manager wanted to \u201crace through\u201d the due diligence process. Here\u2019s what we know from the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s report. The 37-page report published by the UK watchdog says: Deals over \u00a320 million were commonly referred to within Barclays as \u201celephant deals\u201d because of their size and the Transaction, which was for an amount of \u00a31.88 billion, was also referred to as an \u201celephant deal\u201d. The FCA is not suggesting that the deal \u201cinvolved financial crime\u201d, writes Katie Martin. But it says the bank cut corners on checks to avoid irritating important but risky clients. It also went to considerable lengths to keep the transactions confidential, the FCA says.. French bank BNP Paribas also expects the ECB to cut its deposit rate (paid by banks on their ECB deposits) deeper into negative territory. Currently, it is minus 0.2% - and BNPP thinks it will be slashed to -0.4% next Thursday. Other banks expect a 10 basis point cut, to -0.3%. Barclays\u2019 shares are actually up this morning, gaining 3p to 224p, despite the bank being shamed for cutting corners on financial crime checks. Is there no end to the misdeeds of Britain\u2019s banks? Apparently not. Barclays has just been fined \u00a372m by the City watchdog, the FCA. It\u2019s offence? Failing to minimise the risk that it may be used to facilitate financial crime. The FCA says Barclays failed to take proper checks when transferring \u00a31.88bn of funds from \u201cultra-high-net-worth clients\u201d. Banks are supposed to be extra careful when shifting such funds around, in case the money comes from illegal activities and is being laundered through the system. Barclays, though, appears to have bent over backwards to avoid putting out its richest customers. The FCA says: Barclays went to unacceptable lengths to accommodate the clients. Hopefully new CEO Jes Stanley can avoid a repeat.... Kit Juckes, top currency strategist at Societe Generale, says we should expect something pretty serious from the ECB at next Thursday\u2019s meeting. Dipping into classical texts, Kit writes: \u201cHe who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them\u201d. The quote\u2019s from Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War and while I don\u2019t think for a second that Mario Draghi is anyone\u2019s opponent, he is regularly under-estimated. It\u2019s a step up from quoting Chairman Mao, anyway.... So what devilish plan might general Draghi unleash? One option is a \u201csplit-level\u201d negative rate, meaning more punishing negative rates for banks who leave lots of money at the ECB. Kit says: It\u2019s not really obvious that such a policy would drive rates (and in particular, longer-dated rates) any lower, but it reinforces the sense that Mr Draghi is committed to further easing next month. Mario Draghi hinted strongly in October that he could take more action if needed, to get the eurozone away from deflation. So, he risks a backlash if the ECB isn\u2019t decisive next week. As Ken Wattret at BNP Paribas put it to Reuters: \u201cIt cannot run the risk of disappointing markets, having raised expectations of action.\u201d The euro is weakening this morning, as speculation grows that the European Central Bank will announce significant stimulus measures next week. The single currency has slipped to just $1.06 this morning, near a seven-month low. And investors are betting that the euro will keep falling, as Mario Draghi unleashes new measures to drive growth and inflation. Bloomberg explains: Forecasters are cutting their year-end and first-quarter euro estimates at the fastest pace since March, when the start of the central bank\u2019s bond-buying program sent the currency tumbling to a 12-year low. Options signal there\u2019s a 70 percent chance the euro will match that low this year, up from 18 percent when the ECB last met in October. But it\u2019s not clear what Draghi will do. He could boost the ECB\u2019s QE programme, promising to print even more money to spend on government and corporate bonds. Or he could impose even steeper negative interest rates on banks, to force them to lend rather than leave cash gathering dust at the ECB. Steven Bell, London-based chief economist and director of macro strategies at BMO Global Asset Management, says: \u201cHe\u2019s going to pull a rabbit out of the hat -- we\u2019re just not sure what that rabbit will be. \u201cThe euro is going down heavily.\u201d Cute rabbit, though: The Resolution Foundation, a UK think tank, has warned that poor British families are still losing out, despite the tax credit reprieve announced in yesterday\u2019s sutumn statement. And that\u2019s because of longer-term changes to the UK welfare system, which will bring in the universal credit. Torsten Bell, Director of the Resolution Foundation, explains: The attention now turns to the longer term changes to the welfare system the Government has put in train. All the post-2020 welfare cuts announced in the Summer Budget remain in place and will eventually affect millions of families as Universal Credit is rolled out nationally. \u201cNew Resolution Foundation analysis shows that these cuts fall overwhelmingly on poor working families. And this chart shows how low-earners are still set to lose out over this parliament: George Osborne has been conducting a whistle-stop media tour this morning - and sporting a distractingly high-vis jacket - to discuss yesterday\u2019s spending review. There\u2019s a lot of attention on his surprise tax credit u-turn - a sign of weakness, chancellor? Apparently not. Osborne told ITV1\u2019s Good Morning Britain from a building site that: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a weakness, if you are doing this job, to listen to people and listen to the concerns that are made.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and business. Coming up today, we\u2019ll be mopping up economic reaction to Wednesday\u2019s Autumn Statement and Spending Review. The Institute for Fiscal Studies will give its verdict at lunchtime, and will show who really won and lost yesterday. Already, some of the gloss is coming off George Osborne\u2019s big day, with his own independent advisors admitting that the surprise windfall might not actually happen (awkward, as the chancellor has promised to spend it) In the markets, attention is turning to next week\u2019s European Central Bank meeting when new stimulus measures could be laid out. It\u2019s Thanksgiving in America, so our US friends will be busy swapping bon mots over the turkey and preparing for the hell joy of Black Friday. So it could be a quieter day....",

      "bodyText": "An Australian law firm which operates in the UK personal injury claims business has lost more than half its stock market value after George Osborne proposed curbs on claims for whiplash injuries. Shares in Slater &amp; Gordon fell 51% to A$0.94 (\u00a30.44) in Sydney after Wednesday\u2019s spending review. The chancellor said the government would consult on ending the right to cash compensation for minor whiplash injuries. He also outlined plans to slash the legal costs by directing personal injury claims of up to \u00a35,000 to the small claims court. Whiplash costs insurers \u00a32bn a year, or an average \u00a390 per policy. The industry has campaigned for years to end what it calls an epidemic of claims. In the eight years to 2013 the number of road accidents in the UK fell by nearly one-third, but soft tissue injury claims rose by more than 60%. More than nine out of 10 whiplash claims are submitted by claims management firms. In the UK, according to insurance company Aviva, around 80% of personal injury claims are for whiplash injuries, compared to 3% in France. Slater &amp; Gordon bought the so-called professional services division of Quindell, the scandal-hit insurance claims company, in March. The law firm\u2019s shares have plunged from A$7.85 since early April. The deal, which left Quindell as a software company, increased the law firm\u2019s reliance on the UK personal injury market. It had already expanded into the UK no-win, no-fee personal injury claims sector. \u201cWhilst the government\u2019s announcement was unexpected, the company believes that the scale and diversity of the Slater Gordon solutions business in the UK positions it well to deal with the potential impact of any future legislative change,\u201d Slater &amp; Gordon said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange. The law firm, which listed its shares on the stock market in 2007, said it did not expect Osborne\u2019s proposals to affect its performance in the current financial year but warned they would reduce the rights of people injured in road accidents. Slater &amp; Gordon\u2019s shares had already fallen heavily this year over Quindell acquisition and a probe by the Australian authorities into its own accounting. The Serious Fraud Office is investigating business and accounting practices at Quindell. Slater &amp; Gordon said in August when the SFO announced its inquiry that it would not be liable for the results of the investigation. Quindell, a former golf club, appeared to transform itself into a high-tech car insurance claims handling business before doubts emerged about its accounts and business model.",

      "bodyText": "Black Friday is set to become the biggest day of shopping in Britain, with as much as \u00a32bn spent in shops and online in the space of 24 hours. However, five years ago, the shopping event didn\u2019t even exist in the UK. Black Friday is a US shopping tradition exported across the Atlantic by Amazon and Asda. Black Friday takes place in the US the day after Thanksgiving. It involves retailers cutting the price of their goods to encourage households to get back into shops after the US public holiday and it kickstarts the Christmas shopping period. The origins of the name Black Friday is contentious. Some claim it relates to the fact it is the day when retailers turn a profit for the year and move into the black, while others claim it relates to the markdowns on shop prices. However, most agree that retailers ultimately have the Philadelphia police department to thank for Black Friday. The force nicknamed the day after the chaos that engulfed Philadelphia when shoppers flocked to the high street sales just as spectators travelled to the annual Army vs Navy American football match. They are thought to have started using the name in the 1950s and 1960s, judging by local newspaper reports, and the mantle slowly crept nationwide. Shopping has always been key to the Thanksgiving season. The holiday used to be celebrated on the last day of November, but retailers lobbied President Roosevelt to move the day forward so there was more time for Christmas shopping. Eventually, in 1941, it was confirmed that Thanksgiving would always be celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November, rather than the last. Until 2010, the closest UK shoppers got to Black Friday was TV news coverage of the queues at shops across the US. Amazon started offering Black Friday deals in the UK about five years ago. Then, crucially, in 2013, Asda, which is owned by Walmart, the biggest retailer in the US, started offering deals in its supermarkets, encouraging other retailers to join in. Last year, Black Friday became the biggest UK shopping day of the year for the first time, with chaotic scenes across the country. Amazon generated 5.5m orders, ahead of its previous record of 4m orders made in a single day. This year, Amazon is offering 7,000 deals on Black Friday, more than double last year. Visa Europe has predicted Black Friday spending will rise 17% online on compared with 2014 , and 4% in stores. This would result in a record \u00a31.91bn being spent in total.",

      "bodyText": "Four senior executives from the Belfast office of accountancy firm KPMG have been arrested in Belfast on alleged tax evasion charges. The four partners were visited by officials from Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs in the city on Wednesday, it emerged today. In a statement, KPMG said it is cooperating with the HMRC investigation and that the four men have been placed on \u201cadministrative leave\u201d. KPMG said: \u201cPending further information and enquiry, we can confirm that four partners in our Belfast office are on administrative leave. As the matter is ongoing, KPMG is not in a position to make any further comments at this stage.\u201d The men in question have been named as Jon D\u2019Arcy, Eamonn Donaghy, Arthur O\u2019Brien and Paul Hollway, and constitute KPMG\u2019s most senior staff in Northern Ireland. The firm added that it does not have \u201cany indication that this investigation relates to the business of KPMG or the business of our clients\u201d. HMRC said: \u201cOfficers arrested four individuals from Northern Ireland [on Wednesday] in connection with suspected tax evasion. We can\u2019t comment further.\u201d Eamon Donaghy is KPMG\u2019s head of tax in Belfast and has been heavily involved in the campaign to have corporation tax powers devolved to the power-sharing coalition at Stormont. Last week, the Northern Irish parties reached a deal to save the power-sharing devolved government from collapse. Among the agreements secured following more than 10 weeks of negotiations was the right of the Northern Ireland Executive to set a low 12.5% corporation tax rate to compete with the Irish Republic in attracting multinational, foreign direct investment. KPMG has been at the fore of a campaign to persuade the Treasury to grant Northern Ireland special corporation tax status. Among the other KPMG executives arrested on Wednesday was Paul Hollway who is the firm\u2019s head of corporate finance in Ireland. As well as their work for KPMG, the four men are directors of a property investment company called JEAP Ltd. The firm suffered heavy financial losses when the property market crashed in 2008. However, it is unclear at this stage if that forms part of the HMRC investigation.",

      "bodyText": "Railway operator Network Rail has narrowly missed its own punctuality target as more than one in 10 trains arrived late. The owner of Britain\u2019s railway track admitted that \u201ctrain performance has not been as good as we want\u201d after it undershot a target that 90% of trains should be on time in the six months to the end of September. But it fell short by only 0.5%, meaning that it will reach its goal if one in 200 journeys runs a bit quicker. Pretax profits, which are reinvested in the rail network, were down from \u00a3321m to \u00a3246m in the six-month period, despite revenues that were up by \u00a319m to \u00a33.14bn. The revenue increase was offset by extra spending on upgrades and maintenance, with capital spending up by \u00a3216m to \u00a33.2bn. Network Rail has run into difficulty funding a programme of investment in infrastructure upgrades, including electrification of the Midland mainline and TransPennine routes. Its five-year plan to spend \u00a338.5bn on Britain\u2019s railway network was criticised by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) for \u201cstaggering and unacceptable\u201d cost increases. MPs on the committee said the company had \u201clost its grip\u201d, warning that the public would end up paying for plans that could never have been delivered on time and on budget. A huge increase in the cost of electrifying the Great Western line between London and Swansea by 2019 came in for particular criticism. And Network Rail admitted earlier this week that the Cardiff to Swansea section might not be finished until 2024. It was announced in Wednesday\u2019s autumn statement that Network Rail would sell \u00a31.8bn of property to raise funds for these projects. The sell-off, instigated by new chairman Sir Peter Hendy, is set to include space under railways arches and shop space at its stations. Hendy has warned that some projects, such as electrification of the line between Swansea and London, will take longer than expected and cost more money. The body said on Thursday that the rail network is Europe\u2019s safest, adding that it was undergoing the \u201cfastest sustained period of growth since the Victorian era\u201d. And it insisted that the Hendy review \u201csets out a robust and realistic approach to delivering the portfolio of enhancements to the railway network that the country not only needs, but is able to afford\u201d. \u201cIt takes account of the cost pressures the enhancement programme has been under, and sets out an approach to delivering the substantial programme required to help meet today and tomorrow\u2019s capacity demands.\u201d Hendy\u2019s review of Network Rail\u2019s upgrade plans is to be followed next spring by a review by Nicola Shaw, chief executive of the HS1 high-speed line, of the company\u2019s funding model. Unions have raised concerns that the Shaw review could lead to the full-scale privatisation of Network Rail, which is run as an arm\u2019s-length division of central government. Network Rail\u2019s liabilities were added to the government balance sheet last September, effectively nationalising the company. The reclassification constrained its ability to borrow to pay for engineering work, prompting its chief executive, Mark Carne, to warn that projects could be delayed.",

      "bodyText": "An \u201celephant deal\u201d executed three years ago has cost Barclays \u00a372m in penalties after the City regulator concluded that the bank ran the risk of being used to launder money or finance terrorism. To be classified internally as an \u201celephant\u201d, a deal has to be worth \u00a320m or more. This one was worth almost \u00a31.9bn \u2013 so large that it aroused the interest of the Financial Conduct Authority. It was the largest deal of its kind that Barclays\u2019 wealth management operation had executed, and the names of the clients \u2013 so-called politically exposed persons (PEPs) \u2013 were so sensitive they were kept confidential, even inside the bank. Barclays stood to make a \u00a350m profit on handling the cash. The FCA found that instead of conducting a thorough check on the clients, Barclays relaxed its assessments, breaching its own controls. As result the fine is the largest imposed for financial crime failings. It is the seventh penalty imposed on Barclays since 2009, bringing itspenalty bill from the FCA and its predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, to nearly \u00a3500m. Mark Steward, the FCA\u2019s new director of enforcement and market oversight, said: \u201cBarclays ignored its own process designed to safeguard against the risk of financial crime and overlooked obvious red flags to win new business and generate significant revenue. This is wholly unacceptable.\u201d At the time the transaction took place \u2013 in a series of stages between 2011 and 2012 \u2013 the City regulator had issued a warning to banks about their dealings with PEPs. In 2012, Coutts, the private banking arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland, was fined \u00a38.75m for breaches of money-laundering rules in handling the affairs of customers vulnerable to corruption because of their political links. The FCA did not conclude that Barclays facilitated money laundering or terrorist financing when it conducted the transaction, but found that it breached rules put in place intended to ensure checks were made about client suitability. It found that the bank had gone to \u201csignificant lengths to accommodate the clients\u201d, which it described as \u201ca number of ultra-high net worth politically exposed persons\u201d. One manager described it as \u201cthe deal of the century\u201d and the clients were offered up to \u00a337.7m in compensation if the bank failed to comply with confidentiality restrictions. A safe was used to store details of the clients in hard copy \u2013 rather than on computer files \u2013 but \u201cfew people within Barclays knew of the existence and location of the safe\u201d. The bank was driven by a desire for the profits on the deal \u2013 which amounted to \u00a352.3m \u2013 and the prospect of winning further business, the FCA said. The total penalty imposed on Barclays includes disgorgement of this profit \u2013 a step rarely taken by the regulator. The deal was an intricate one, involving investments in structured bonds, and a number of companies were used to facilitate the transaction. The aim of the deal was to provide the clients with a specified rate of income with full capital guarantee over a number of decades. Barclays said: \u201cThe FCA made no finding that Barclays facilitated any financial crime in relation to the transaction or the clients on whose behalf it was executed. Barclays has co-operated fully with the FCA throughout and continues to apply significant resources and training to ensure compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements.\u201d Robert Barrington, the executive director of Transparency International UK, questioned why the Barclays staff involved in the deal had not been named or punished. \u201cWhile we welcome the regulatory action and the fact that the company has co-operated with the investigation, for a failure on this scale we would expect to see action taken against key individuals, which may include prosecution or being de-barred from working in financial services,\u201d he said. . The fine comes as Barclays\u2019 new chief executive, Jes Staley, prepares to take the helm on 1 December. The American banker has said improving trust in the bank is part of his mandate, in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal in 2012 that forced out the former chief executive Bob Diamond and prompted a wave of anger about bankers\u2019 activities.",

      "bodyText": "Up to 1,000 job losses are expected to be announced at Lloyds Banking Group in the latest attempt by the bailed-out bank to cut costs and bolster profitability. The cuts are thought to be part of the 9,000 reductions earmarked by Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, chief executive of Lloyds, during a three-year strategy update a year ago. At the time, Horta-Os\u00f3rio blamed the need for the bank to be \u201cdigitised\u201d for cuts to the 85,000-strong workforce and the closure of 200 branches, with the aim of saving \u00a31bn by 2017. The job toll has been mounting at Lloyds since the rescue of HBOS at the height of the 2008 banking crisis. Around 30,000 jobs went as part of the integration while Horta-Os\u00f3rio axed a further 15,000 as part of his first three-year plan when he took over in 2011. Unions are concerned about the impact on customer service from the job toll. The latest cull is thought to be spread across a large number of departments and operations. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer for finance, said: \u201cOnce again we see Lloyds bank seeking to make short-term \u2018savings\u2019 at the expense of both the workforce and customer service. \u201cUnite\u2019s overriding concern is to challenge and avoid any compulsory redundancies.\u201d The job cuts have been part of the programme to help Lloyds return to the private sector after its \u00a320bn taxpayer bailout in 2008. The government stake has fallen from 43% at the time of the bailout to close to 10%. The shares have been sold off to City investors but the government is keeping some shares back to offer to retail investors next year. Lloyds would not comment on the latest cuts.",

    "webTitle": "Fury over Osborne's \u00a311.6bn business 'payroll tax'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Business leaders have been left reeling after George Osborne announced a \u00a311.6bn \u201cpayroll tax\u201d and removed hundreds of millions of pounds of support. Companies will be charged 0.5% of their payroll from April 2017 towards the apprenticeship levy, which will raise roughly \u00a33bn a year for the following four years Business groups reacted with fury to the move, with the Institute of Directors labelling it a \u201cpayroll tax\u201d and the CBI claiming it represents a \u201ctipping point\u201d for the UK\u2019s competitiveness and a \u201csting in the tail\u201d. In a further blow, the government delayed revealing the findings of its review into business rates until next year\u2019s budget. It also ended a \u00a31,500 tax discount for 278,000 small and medium-sized retailers, worth an estimated \u00a3417m. These firms will face a 20% increase in their business rates bill next year. Companies employing large numbers of people and with significant amounts of property will be particularly affected by the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement. The British Retail Consortium has estimated that business rates, the apprenticeship levy and the \u201cnational living wage\u201d will cost retailers an extra \u00a314bn over the next five years. Tesco, for example, which employs 310,000 people in the UK and has more than 3,500 stores, has to introduce the national living wage for over-25s, hand over tens of millions of pounds in business rates, and pay out 0.5% of its staff costs in the apprenticeship levy. Dave Lewis, chief executive of the retailer, has warned this is a \u201cpotentially lethal cocktail\u201d of costs. Tesco\u2019s business rates bill had already increased by 35% in the past five years and the apprenticeship levy will dwarf its existing training bill, although Britain\u2019s biggest private employer did not disclose the exact cost. The apprenticeship levy is designed to fund 3m places for apprentices. Businesses that spend less than \u00a33m on wages a year will not pay any tax because each employer will receive a \u00a315,000 allowance that offsets the cost. The chancellor said this would mean 98% of businesses are exempt, but those employing as few as 100 workers could be caught up by the levy. The Institute of Directors criticised the tax, claiming a quarter of it will be spent on government bureaucracy and administration. Simon Walker, director general of the IoD, said: \u201cThe major business tax announcement of this autumn statement was the apprenticeship levy, which can only be described as a new payroll tax. At 0.5% of payroll it will be a big new cost for many companies, including medium-sized ones. \u201cWe are very concerned by the government\u2019s assumption that a quarter of the money collected will be spent on just administering the levy. Firms have been promised they will get back more than they put in, but it\u2019s not clear how this will happen if so much is being lost in bureaucracy.\u201d Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI business lobby group, said Britain\u2019s competitiveness had been damaged by the introduction of the national living wage, business rates and the apprenticeship levy. She said: \u201cThis was a good spending review for longer-term investment in the economy but there\u2019s a sting in the tail in the size and scope of the apprenticeship levy. \u201cBusiness recognises there are tough choices to be made in balancing the books, but many are reaching a tipping point, where the cumulative burden of the living wage, apprenticeship levy and business rates risk hurting competitiveness. Many firms will be disappointed to have been kept hanging on for a much-needed review of business rates until next year\u2019s budget.\u201d Even manufacturers, which could benefit most from new apprenticeship, questioned the levy. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of the EEF, the manufacturing industry trade body, said: \u201cThe apprenticeship levy is a blunt instrument, and the Government must work hard to ensure employers are not disadvantaged and that many smaller and medium sized businesses are exempted. \u201cWhat really matters is creating high-quality, well-trained apprentices who can look forward to successful careers in industry. This cannot be a simple numbers game where businesses are clobbered to pay for apprenticeships. The government\u2019s approach to this requires a lot more sophistication than we\u2019ve seen so far.\u201d Small businesses had more to cheer in the autumn statement, with many given exemption from the apprenticeship levy, and the chancellor pressing on with small business rate relief for 600,000 firms. However, discounts on rates for high street businesses was not extended, meaning small shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants face a sharp increase in their bill next year. Paul Turner-Mitchell, a business rates expert, said the autumn statement had been \u201cterrible\u201d for retailers, with increasing signs that a review of the commercial property tax would prove a damp squib. Forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility show that total business rates payments are expected to rise a further 16.5% between this financial year and 2020-21 to \u00a332.4bn. The chancellor announced the review into business rates last year amid growing complaints that the tax did not move in line with economic growth and placed a disproportionate burden on some sectors, such as retail. However, Osborne handed local authorities more power to set the tax and said the review would be \u201cfiscally neutral\u201d. \u201cThe autumn statement was terrible for both the retail sector and those who have campaigned long and hard for the meaningful structural reform of the system,\u201d Turner-Mitchell said. \u201cFirst there was the manifesto U-turn to report on reform by the end of the year. Then came the scrapping of retail relief followed by yet another increase in a tax already the highest in the world and highly uncompetitive. It\u2019s a real kick in the teeth and the government has just simply not listened.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s a real skills shortage. It\u2019s getting worse\u2019 Matthew Kimpton-Smith is giving the chancellor\u2019s new apprenticeship levy a cautious welcome. He has taken his 40-year-old family business through the recession, weathered this year\u2019s downturn in China and brushed off a slump in demand from a battered oil and gas industry. But there is one area the manufacturer sees as a growing challenge: finding skilled engineers. \u201cWe are constantly hiring because it is taking a long time to fill the vacancies with the right people,\u201d says Kimpton-Smith), group managing director at Cheshire manufacturer Cygnet. His company makes machines for manufacturers of lightweight fibres that go into things like aeroplanes and cars. It is an area in which he feels the UK is leading. \u201cBut we have a real skills shortage and it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d says Kimpton-Smith, whose parents founded Cygnet in 1974. With a workforce of 140 and a wage bill of around \u00a35m, Cygnet will have to pay around \u00a310,000 extra a year in tax under the levy. Lobby groups for big business have lambasted the levy, but Kimpton-Smith supported the principle, while waiting to see how the scheme is used in practice. George Osborne pledged that those paying it will \u201cget out more than they put in\u201d. \u201cFor us in engineering and manufacturing, to promote apprenticeships, I will take the hit,\u201d said Kimpton-Smith, whose company has three apprentices. \u201cThe total effect in the end I think will be good for us and I think it\u2019s important for the country to be investing in skills.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "South Korea has ordered the recall of 125,522 Volkswagen cars after revealing that its own testing showed that the carmaker deliberately manipulated a diesel emissions device in vehicles with an older engine. South Korea is the first country after the United States to announce measures based on it own testing to address the diesel emissions scandal that has engulfed Europe\u2019s biggest auto manufacturer. It came after regulators in California ordered Volkswagen on Wednesday to recall around 16,000 diesel vehicles. The California Air Resources Board said it had told Volkswagen Group of America to recall all VW, Audi and Porsche vehicles equipped with 3.0-litre diesel engines in the model years 2009-2015 that were sold in California. In September, Volkswagen admitted that it installed software in up to 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide that vastly understated their actual emissions of smog-causing nitrogen oxides. South Korea\u2019s environment ministry said on Thursday that it ordered Volkswagen Korea to submit a recall plan by 6 January 2016, and also fined the unit 14.1bn won ($12.31 million). Cars to be recalled are Euro 5 engine vehicles with 2,000cc and 1,600cc diesel \u201cEA189\u201d engines, mainly sold in South Korea between 2008 and 2015. They include the popular Tiguan model, the ministry said in a statement. The ministry said it had not yet determined whether VW vehicles with the newer \u201cEA288\u201d engine \u2013 mainly Euro 6 models \u2013 had manipulated emissions, and could announce results after it completed testing the diesel models of 16 manufacturers by April. A Volkswagen Korea spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment. Sales of diesel-powered German imports have been gaining share in recent years in a South Korean market long dominated by home-grown players led by Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors. However, the market share of imported vehicles fell from 15.7% in September to 12.34% in October, the lowest percentage since July 2013. Volkwagen sales fell from 2,901 registered vehicles in September to just 947 in October, according to the Korea Automobile Importers &amp; Distributors Association, a trade group. Among imported brands, Volkswagen\u2019s share fell from 14.2% in September to 5.4% in October. The Korean move came as a federal court in Australia said that it expected VW to cooperate with courts in Australia so a class action over the emissions scam could proceed.",
