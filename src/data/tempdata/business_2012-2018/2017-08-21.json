      "bodyText": "Ford has announced a car and van scrappage scheme in a bid to get dirtier vehicles off the roads and boost its sales in the UK\u2019s flagging car market. While other manufacturers, including Vauxhall and BMW, have launched scrappage schemes this year, Ford\u2019s is unusual in allowing customers to trade in and scrap any brand of older vehicle for at least \u00a32,000. Any vehicle registered before the end of 2009, with a pre-Euro V standard engine, is eligible for the scrappage incentive against a range of Ford vehicles, up to \u00a37,000 for purchasing a Transit van. Ford makes the UK\u2019s bestselling car, the Fiesta, and van, the Transit Custom. After years of consistent growth based on cheap financing deals, UK car sales have dropped, with a 9% downturn in July attributed to a squeeze on lending and fears around Brexit. Air pollution concerns, heightened by the VW emissions scandal, have also led manufacturers in Germany to offer large incentives to trade in the most polluting older diesels. Andy Barratt, chairman and managing director of Ford of Britain, said: \u201cFord shares society\u2019s concerns over air quality. Removing generations of the most polluting vehicles will have the most immediate positive effect on air quality, and this Ford scrappage scheme aims to do just that. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe incentivising sales of new cars goes far enough and we will ensure that all trade-in vehicles are scrapped.\u201d Ford said scrappage schemes could take hundreds of thousands of the dirtiest vehicles off the roads, to replace them with models using the latest Euro VI standard engines emitting 80% to 90% less NOx (the generic term for polluting notrogen oxides) and particulates. Signals that the government or local authorities may clamp down on diesel cars have also spooked buyers, according to David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University. \u201cPeople are worried about the residual values of their diesels; some analysts think the share of the diesel market could be as low as 15% by 2025,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that we\u2019ve had peak diesel \u2013 it was a wrong turn. Car companies are going to have to take action. \u201cUK sales have been down in the last few months, partly as the market was overtrading before, with a lot of financial innovation around [car loans] \u2013 and now of course there is an effect from Brexit, both from currency depreciation and an impact on real incomes.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A campaigning group opposed to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s takeover of Sky is threatening a legal challenge to the media regulator\u2019s ruling that the broadcaster would remain \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold a UK licence if it was snapped up by 21st Century Fox. Activist group Avaaz has hired lawyers and launched the first steps of a judicial review against the communications regulator following its report into the \u00a311.7bn bid by Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox for the 61% of Sky it does not already own. Solicitors representing the group have issued a letter before claim to Ofcom, to which the watchdog has 14 days to respond before a formal judicial review can begin. It comes after the government asked the regulator earlier this month to provide further advice before culture secretary Karen Bradley decides whether the proposed tie-up should face an in-depth investigation. Ofcom told the secretary of state in June that the takeover attempt raised \u201cpublic interest concerns\u201d and she could refer the deal to the Competition and Markets Authority for a fuller investigation on the grounds of media plurality. However, a separate report by Ofcom cleared the Murdochs as \u201cfit and proper\u201d owners of Sky. Alex Wilks, the Avaaz campaign director, said: \u201cOfcom\u2019s made mistake after mistake in deciding to give the Murdochs a clean bill of health to take over more of our media. They need to reopen their investigation to regain credibility.\u201d Avaaz claims the watchdog\u2019s decision not to rule against the deal when it came to the UK broadcasting licence was based on \u201cexaggerated fears of the consequences of doing so\u201d. The activist group alleged Ofcom had set too high a bar for finding 21st Century Fox \u201cunfit and improper\u201d to hold a licence. It also claimed the regulator had made errors when assessing 21st Century Fox\u2019s compliance with the UK broadcasting code, drew \u201cwrong conclusions\u201d from allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News, and ignored the role James Murdoch would play as chief executive of 21st Century Fox. Bradley asked Ofcom for more analysis after her department received new submissions on the takeover, including from Avaaz and MPs including former Labour leader and longtime Murdoch critic Ed Miliband. Opponents of the deal have urged the government and Ofcom to deepen their investigation into the Murdoch family\u2019s suitability to buy Sky because of allegations that Fox News had colluded with the White House on a story that contained fabricated quotes. Rupert Murdoch has piled pressure on Bradley, saying her treatment of the bid will prove a test case for how far Britain is \u201copen for business\u201d. His approach comes after his last attempt at taking over the business through News Corporation in 2011. The bid faced opposition from media industry rivals and politicians before it was scuppered by acute pressure on the company, brought about by phone-hacking claims involving News International. An Ofcom spokesman said: \u201cWe can confirm that we\u2019ve received a further letter from Avaaz in relation to our \u2018fit and proper\u2019 decision of 29 June. We will respond to the letter in due course.\u201d Bradley said last month that she was \u201cstill minded\u201d to refer the takeover bid to the CMA.",

      "bodyText": "Record low wages growth has led the ALP and unions to believe that voters are willing for governments to take a more hands-on approach than has been the case since the Keating government introduced enterprise bargaining in the early 1990s. And, somewhat ironically, the very system of enterprise bargaining looks set to become a major political battleground. Last week, as the latest release of the wage price index showed another record low in wages growth, the Department of Employment figures on enterprise bargaining agreements (EBAs) showed much the same. In the March quarter, the average annual wage increase within the 761 agreements signed was just 2.7% \u2013 the lowest growth recorded since December 1991. The wage growth in EBAs is not directly comparable with the wage price index because the index looks back over the past year, whereas the annual growth in the EBA is an average over the length of the EBA (usually about three years) \u2013 so it is more of a forward-looking measure. EBAs are also much more likely to be negotiated by unions than are most workers\u2019 wages. As I noted last week, only about 15% of all workers are members of a trade union, but about 88% of the nearly two million workers operating under an EBA are under one negotiated by a union. Those covered by union-negotiated EBAs also generally have higher wage increases than the non-union ones: So it is not surprising that EBAs have had higher annual wage growth than the overall wage price index. But it is noticeable that the gap between the two measures has recently increased. And the news looking ahead is not good either. Since September 2012, the average wage growth of EBAs agreed each quarter has been below the average for all current EBAs except for one quarter \u2013 suggesting the overall average will continue to fall, and there is little sign of improvement: But what is more striking about the latest figures is not the low wage growth (hardly unexpected) but the decline in the number of people covered by EBAs. In the past four years the number of private sector workers covered by EBAs has dropped by 25%. In December 2013 there were 1.954m private sector workers operating under EBAs \u2013 in March this year it was 1.475m: The biggest drop has occurred in the retail trade sector, but it has occurred generally across all industries. There are 36% fewer EBAs in operation now than there were four years ago \u2013 and while there has been some drop in the public sector, overwhelmingly the decline has come from the private sector: It has led to a situation where there has been a sharp increase in the number of workers operating under an award \u2013 up from 10% in 2010 to now 24%: This area will be the main industrial relations battlefield at the next election, and one of the major issues is the increase in EBA terminations during the bargaining of a new agreement. This issue has arisen since the Fair Work Commission\u2019s decision to terminate the Aurizon EBA in April 2015. That decision drastically changed the nature of the EBA \u2013 from being based on the assumption it would be ongoing until renegotiated; to being able to be terminated during the bargaining process and threatening to put workers back on award rate conditions. The ALP\u2019s employment spokesperson, Brenan O\u2019Connor, gave a speech to the Sydney Institute earlier this month in which he pledged to end the ability of employers to follow this \u201cnuclear option\u201d. It is a stance echoed by the president of the ACTU, Ged Kearney, who argues that \u201ccancelling agreements is a new form of industrial blackmail\u201d and that \u201cthe precedent set by the Fair Work Commission\u2019s ruling on Aurizon is being exploited by companies which now use termination of agreements as a bargaining tool\u201d. There certainly has been an increase in the number of EBAs terminated. The Department of Employment, in its submission to the Senate inquiry into \u201cIncidence of, and trends in, corporate avoidance of the Fair Work Act 2009\u201d found that there had been an increase in terminations, but that up until that time (mid-2016) most had involved a small numbers of workers: However, the issue is a live one \u2013 in the past week, Unilever have sought to terminate the EBA for its Street Ice Cream factory workers in western Sydney. On the employers\u2019 side, the Ai Group has argued that the increase in terminations is not evidence that the enterprise bargaining system is broken. It argues that, despite the high-profile terminations \u201ceach year, on average, 17,000 enterprise agreements are approved by the commission\u201d. But the data released last week show that there has been a sharp drop in the approvals of new EBAs since 2012: The ACTU also notes that since 2014 only 8.5% of the agreements terminated were made during the WorkChoices era, \u201cwhereas the remainder were those underwritten by a requirement to not disadvantage employees compared to the award (26.3%) or ensure employees were better off overall compared to the award (65.2%)\u201d. Ged Kearney argues that \u201cemployers should not be able to hold the threat of termination of agreements over workers\u2019 heads. It\u2019s converting the bargaining system into a tool to cut pay and living standards when it was supposed to be about improving people\u2019s lives\u201d Pointedly, she says of this practice, \u201cit must end\u201d. That employer groups seem more happy with the current enterprise bargaining system than unions probably gives a good indicator of how it is being used. And after a quarter of a century during which the ALP, for the most part, has been wary of taking an overly interventionist approach to IR, it appears that (as with their thinking on negative gearing) they believe the time is ripe for a shift in policy. With workers now almost resigned to low wage growth, the belief that a hands-off approach to IR is the best for the economy \u2013 and workers \u2013 might be ready to be challenged.",

And, somewhat ironically, the very system of enterprise bargaining looks set to become a major political battleground. </p> <p>Last week, as the latest release of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/17/unemployment-is-falling-but-so-are-wages-its-the-latest-of-a-very-long-slide\">wage price index</a> showed another record low in wages growth, the Department of Employment figures <a href=\"https://www.employment.gov.au/trends-federal-enterprise-bargaining\">on enterprise bargaining agreements (EBAs)</a> showed much the same.</p> <p>In the March quarter, the average annual wage increase within the 761 agreements signed was just 2.7% \u2013 the lowest growth recorded since December 1991.</p> <p>The wage growth in EBAs is not directly comparable with the wage price index because the index looks back over the past year, whereas the annual growth in the EBA is an average over the length of the EBA (usually about three years) \u2013 so it is more of a forward-looking measure.</p> <p>EBAs are also much more likely to be negotiated by unions than are most workers\u2019 wages. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/aug/15/imf-report-shows-lower-unionisation-leads-to-lower-wages\">As I noted last week</a>, only about 15% of all workers are members of a trade union, but about 88% of the nearly two million workers operating under an EBA are under one negotiated by a union.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/aug/15/imf-report-shows-lower-unionisation-leads-to-lower-wages\">Why workers are losing their share of Australia's national income | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those covered by union-negotiated EBAs also generally have higher wage increases than the non-union ones:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual wage growth of EBA approved by union coverage\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Mw9vu/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So it is not surprising that EBAs have had higher annual wage growth than the overall wage price index. But it is noticeable that the gap between the two measures has recently increased.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of total wages and wages under enterprise bargaining agreements\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IUsQA/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And the news looking ahead is not good either. </p> <p>Since September 2012, the average wage growth of EBAs agreed each quarter has been below the average for all current EBAs except for one quarter \u2013 suggesting the overall average will continue to fall, and there is little sign of improvement:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average annual wage growth of enterprise barganing agreements\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xIFXx/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But what is more striking about the latest figures is not the low wage growth (hardly unexpected) but the decline in the number of people covered by EBAs.</p> <p>In the past four years the number of private sector workers covered by EBAs has dropped by 25%. In December 2013 there were 1.954m private sector workers operating under EBAs \u2013 in March this year it was 1.475m:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Employees covered by enterprise bargaining agreements\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/N5iE8/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The biggest drop has occurred in the retail trade sector, but it has occurred generally across all industries. There are 36% fewer EBAs in operation now than there were four years ago \u2013 and while there has been some drop in the public sector, overwhelmingly the decline has come from the private sector:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Number of current enterprise bargaining agreements\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2JxdA/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It has led to a situation where there has been a sharp increase in the number of workers operating under an award \u2013 up from 10% in 2010 to now 24%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Instrument providing rate of pay for all employees\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/K9Ac7/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This area will be the main industrial relations battlefield at the next election, and one of the major issues is the increase in EBA terminations during the bargaining of a new agreement.</p> <p>This issue has arisen since the Fair Work Commission\u2019s decision to terminate the Aurizon EBA in April 2015. That decision drastically changed the nature of the EBA \u2013 from being based on the assumption it would be ongoing until renegotiated; to being able to be terminated during the bargaining process and threatening to put workers back on award rate conditions.</p> <p>The ALP\u2019s employment spokesperson, Brenan O\u2019Connor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/aug/15/imf-report-shows-lower-unionisation-leads-to-lower-wages\">gave a speech</a> to the Sydney Institute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/02/labors-election-pledge-we-will-boost-bargaining-power-of-workers\">earlier this month</a> in which he pledged to end the ability of employers to follow this \u201cnuclear option\u201d.</p> <p>It is a stance echoed by the president of the ACTU, Ged Kearney, who argues that \u201ccancelling agreements is a new form of industrial blackmail\u201d and that \u201cthe precedent set by the Fair Work Commission\u2019s ruling on Aurizon is being exploited by companies which now use termination of agreements as a bargaining tool\u201d.</p> <p>There certainly has been an increase in the number of EBAs terminated. </p> <p>The Department of Employment, in its submission to the Senate inquiry into \u201cIncidence of, and trends in, corporate avoidance of the Fair Work Act 2009\u201d found that there had been an increase in terminations, but that up until that time (mid-2016) most had involved a small numbers of workers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Enterprise agreements terminated\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xX9B8/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>However, the issue is a live one \u2013 in the past week, Unilever have sought to terminate the EBA for its Street Ice Cream factory workers in western Sydney.</p> <p>On the employers\u2019 side, <a href=\"http://blog.aigroup.com.au/terminating-expired-enterprise-agreements-is-the-system-broken-or-balanced/\">the Ai Group</a> has argued that the increase in terminations is not evidence that the enterprise bargaining system is broken. It argues that, despite the high-profile terminations \u201ceach year, on average, 17,000 enterprise agreements are approved by the commission\u201d.</p> <p>But the data released last week show that there has been a sharp drop in the approvals of new EBAs since 2012:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Enterprise bargaining agreements approved in the past year\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HiLw7/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The ACTU also notes that since 2014 only 8.5% of the agreements terminated were made during the WorkChoices era, \u201cwhereas the remainder were those underwritten by a requirement to not disadvantage employees compared to the award (26.3%) or ensure employees were better off overall compared to the award (65.2%)\u201d. </p> <p>Ged Kearney argues that \u201cemployers should not be able to hold the threat of termination of agreements over workers\u2019 heads. It\u2019s converting the bargaining system into a tool to cut pay and living standards when it was supposed to be about improving people\u2019s lives\u201d</p> <p>Pointedly, she says of this practice, \u201cit must end\u201d.</p> <p>That employer groups seem more happy with the current enterprise bargaining system than unions probably gives a good indicator of how it is being used. And after a quarter of a century during which the ALP, for the most part, has been wary of taking an overly interventionist approach to IR, it appears that (as with their thinking on negative gearing) they believe the time is ripe for a shift in policy.</p> <p>With workers now almost resigned to low wage growth, the belief that a hands-off approach to IR is the best for the economy \u2013 and workers \u2013 might be ready to be challenged.</p>",

When Sir Arnold Robinson has advice to give to his successor, Sir Humphrey Appleby, he does it over lunch at a Pall Mall club. Lord Macpherson, until recently the Treasury\u2019s top mandarin, has some advice for the current government: it\u2019s time to move on from quantitative easing, the scheme that has been pumping electronic money into the economy since early 2009. Not for Macpherson a quiet word over an agreeable bottle of claret. Instead, he took to Twitter to compare QE to heroin: ever bigger doses are needed to get a high. Did Macpherson say this when he was working for Alastair Darling, who originally gave the Bank of England permission to start QE, or George Osborne, who said the economy needed more of it? We won\u2019t know that until the records of the Great Recession and its aftermath are released in a couple of decades, but if he did the warning was not heeded. The best that can be said for QE is that it helped prevent an even deeper slump in the winter of 2008-09 but was of less importance than the re-capitalisation of the banks and the deep, co-ordinated cuts in interest rates from central banks. There were also better ways to boost demand. To an extent QE merely compensated for the fiscal austerity announced by Osborne (and strongly supported by Macpherson). What\u2019s more, much of the extra money swilling around the economy found its way into speculation rather than into remedying the economy\u2019s structural weaknesses. Rich people benefited because the value of their homes and share portfolios went up; poor people suffered because commodity prices also went up, raising food and fuel prices. So Macpherson is right. QE was never particularly effective, was always fundamentally inequitable and has been left in place for too long. Central banks know this, which is why the US Federal Reserve will soon starting selling bonds and why the financial markets will be all agog for any hints from Mario Draghi at this week\u2019s Jackson Hole get-together about when the European Central Bank might do the same. The issue is not whether central banks should wean themselves off QE but whether they can do so without bringing to an end the tepid recovery in the global economy. Macpherson\u2019s tweet was in response to a warning by Rupert Harrison, Osborne\u2019s chief economic adviser, that the ECB risked a \u201ccar crash\u201d if it abandoned QE too quickly. When you are hooked it can awfully hard to kick the habit. Can Trump make US debt great again? In the past couple of months Donald Trump has tried and failed to repeal Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Health Care Act, threatened North Korea with war, fired the opening salvos in a trade war with China and lost the confidence of those running America\u2019s big corporations. Since this catalogue of misfortune seems to have had zero impact on Wall Street, it is worth contemplating what might shake the markets out of their complacency. How about the government running out of money and repudiating its debts? The US Treasury hit the borrowing limit set by Congress in March and has since been unable to issue any new debt. It has been making ends meet since by running down its reserves but you can only live off fat for so long and the cash will be used up by mid-October. On the assumption that the US won\u2019t want to leave it until a minute to midnight to sort things out, the debt ceiling will need to be raised within the next few weeks. That\u2019s cutting things fine, especially since some Republicans in the House of Representatives are insisting that raising the ceiling should be contingent on public spending cuts and that will mean a real struggle to get the necessary bipartisan support in the Senate. There are two ways the issue could be resolved. Trump could use his authority to prod Congress into raising the ceiling. Or a run on shares caused by fears of a default could concentrate minds.

      "bodyText": "A former senior Treasury mandarin has compared quantitative easing to heroin and called for an end to almost a decade of electronic money printing by central banks. Nick Macpherson was permanent secretary to the Treasury when Bank of England officials started buying UK government bonds to stimulate the economy following the financial crisis. On Monday, he said it was \u201ctime to move on\u201d from QE, which is credited with helping Britain into recovery but remains in use nine years later amid concerns over Brexit. Threadneedle Street initially began pumping \u00a3200bn into the gilt market in 2009 to boost the economy, before expanding the programme to \u00a3435bn, including an extra \u00a360bn following the EU referendum. The bond buying scheme is similar to massive stimulus packages used by other countries, such as the US Federal Reserve\u2019s $4.5tn of asset purchases (\u00a33.5tn) and the European Central Bank\u2019s \u20ac2.3tn (\u00a32.1tn) plan. Lord Macpherson\u2019s call comes as pressure mounts on the world\u2019s central bankers to give more clues about how they intend to exit QE in a process known as \u201cnormalisation\u201d almost a decade on from the crash. Some indications could be given at a meeting of senior officials at Jackson Hole in the US later this week. Mario Draghi, the ECB governor, is expected to be the star turn at the event watched by global investors, although he is not thought to be preparing to announce the end of QE just yet. While QE is credited with lowering borrowing costs and helping banks to lend more to consumers and businesses, critics say such schemes inflate assets owned by the richest in society, while punishing savers without large amounts of wealth. Macpherson did not single out the specific bond-buying programme of a particular central bank. \u201cQE like heroin: need ever increasing fixes to create a high. Meanwhile, negative side effects increase. Time to move on,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. The former senior civil servant was writing in response to George Osborne\u2019s former adviser Rupert Harrison, now a fund manager at BlackRock, who had tweeted a link to a Financial Times article on pressures facing the ECB to taper its QE programme. In another reply to Harrison\u2019s tweet, he appeared to suggest that QE was a \u201cpolicy which is yielding diminishing returns\u201d. Harrison said people are \u201cwaking up to the impending ECB slow-motion car crash\u201d and that there were \u201cpolitical constraints on eurozone monetary policy starting to bite once again\u201d.",

The announcement of the symbolic date comes after staff at restaurants in Cambridge and Crayford, in south-east London, voted overwhelmingly on Friday to go on strike. They are demanding wages of at least \u00a310 an hour, secure contracts with guaranteed hours and formal trade union recognition from McDonald\u2019s. The choice of Labor Day is intended to signify the workers\u2019 solidarity with fast food employees internationally, according to the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU). In previous years, thousands of US fast food employees have participated in Labor Day strikes and demonstrations as part of Fight for 15, a campaign for a $15 (\u00a311.60) hourly wage, coordinated by the Service Employees International Union. The UK action is taking place with the help of organisers from the Unite union in New Zealand, who are visiting the UK to advise the striking workers. Unite has won significant victories, including a $15 an hour minimum wage and legislation outlawing zero-hours contracts, in New Zealand. A delegation of workers from Belgium will also be travelling to London to support the UK strike. The BFAWU is calling for international support, and it is hoped that allied unions in other countries will also take part in actions on 4 September. A BFAWU representative said: \u201cIn the past we have had action on every continent.\u201d In April, McDonald\u2019s announced it would offer guaranteed-hours contracts to all employees who wanted them. However, the BFAWU claims that workers at most stores were told nothing about this until workers decided to strike. Organiser Gareth Lane said: \u201cAll of a sudden they\u2019ve put it online where workers can see that all workers will have a contract with guaranteed hours by the end of the year. This is a huge victory for these workers who\u2019ve stood up, decided to organise and take this strike action.\u201d He said the intention of the action on 4 September was to maintain pressure on the chain to deliver on its offer. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust McDonald\u2019s to deliver these guaranteed hours to workers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want them to sign, legally, that they\u2019ll give these guaranteed contracts by the end of the year.\u201d Shen Batmaz, one of the McDonald\u2019s workers going on strike in Crayford who is also a political campaigner, said international support had helped bolster workers\u2019 determination to strike. \u201cFor a long time we were told as fast food workers we were really hard to organise because people leave all the time and a lot of us are young people,\u201d she said. \u201cFor us to see there were people doing it, not just in the US but all over the world, we knew it was time for us to come together.\u201d A spokesman for McDonald\u2019s said on Friday: \u201cWe can confirm that, following a ballot process, the BFAWU have indicated that a small number of our employees representing less than 0.01% of our workforce are intending to strike in two of our restaurants.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets have a cautious tone ahead of some key events later in the week. North Korean tensions could be on the rise again as the US and South Korea begin military exercises, while on the economic front, all eyes will be on the Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers. Observers will be looking for clues about any easing off of quantitative easing programmes, but meanwhile a former senior Treasury official has described QE as \u201clike heroin.\u201d Elsewhere, Britain\u2019s current account deficit was worse than expected in 2015, according to new figures, and Germany\u2019s economy could grow faster than initial forecasts, says the Bundesbank. On the corporate front, a Chinese company is said to be interested in Fiat Chrysler, while Total is paying $7.5bn for Maersk Oil to boost its presence in the North Sea. The German chancellor Angela Merkel has hit out at bonuses paid to chief executives of car companies in the wake of the emissions scandal. On the markets, the FTSE 100 is virtually unchanged, down just 0.04%. Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped 0.36% and France\u2019s Cac is down 0.32%. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Britain\u2019s current account deficit in 2015 was bigger than originally thought, according to new government figures. Reuters has the details: Britain\u2019s current account deficit, the largest of any major economy last year, was even bigger in 2015 than previously thought, according to new estimates from the Office for National Statistics. The current account deficit has been in the spotlight since last year\u2019s vote on leaving the European Union, and although it has narrowed recently is not far off levels that would trigger a currency crisis in a less developed economy. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in the run-up to the referendum that Britain was reliant on the \u201ckindness of strangers\u201d, highlighting how the country needed tens of billions of pounds of foreign finance a year to balance its books. The ONS said on Monday it now estimated the current account deficit was 98 billion pounds in 2015, equivalent to 5.2 percent of gross domestic product, compared with its previous estimate of 80 billion pounds or 4.3 percent of GDP. Much of the increase stemmed from new methodology that showed British companies paid out more interest to foreign holders of corporate bonds than initially estimated, resulting in a larger current account deficit. The revisions come more than a year after the government published a review of the ONS by former Bank of England deputy governor Charles Bean, who said many of its statistics were showing their age - especially in capturing the digital economy. An ex-Treasury official \u2013 formerly the most senior civil servant at the department \u2013 has described the Bank of England\u2019s money printing programme as \u201clike heroin\u201d and called for its end. Lord Macpherson of Earls Court, who was permanent secretary to the Treasury from 2005 to 2016 and oversaw the Bank\u2019s introduction of quantitative easing as a response to the financial crisis in 2009, tweeted today: The European Central Bank is pondering how to move away from its own quantitative easing programme, while the US Federal Reserve is expected to begin unwinding its positions later this year. But there is no sign so far of the Bank of England following suit. Four years ago Lord Macpherson told a committee of MPs there was uncertainty in Whitehall as to whether a move at the time to increase QE was the right thing to do. He said: \u201cI\u2019m confident that QE has had a positive effect but in one sense this is an experiment and we won\u2019t know the ultimate answer for many years.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen we set it up we didn\u2019t anticipate that quantitative easing would last quite as long as it has nor did we anticipate that quite such a large fund would be built up.\u201d Germany\u2019s economy could grow faster than expected this year, according to economist at the country\u2019s central bank. The Bundesbank had previously predicted 1.9% growth in 2017. But with a strong start to the year - 0.7% GDP growth in the first three months, 0.6% in the second quarter - it says in its latest monthly report: The Bundesbank believes that the German economy is likely to continue to grow with strong momentum in the current quarter, too. This is suggested.. by the exceptionally upbeat sentiment among both enterprises and consumers as well as the positive order situation in the industrial sector. The underlying pace of economic activity, which was already quite strong in the previous year owing to buoyant domestic activity, recently accelerated again given a more favourable external environment, the report continues. \u201cOverall, GDP growth in the current year could even be somewhat stronger than expected in the June projection\u201d, write the Bundesbank\u2019s economists. In early June, the Bundesbank projected a 1.9% rise in calendar-adjusted GDP for 2017. Good news for Angela Merkel as she campaigns for the forthcoming elections. Donald Trump\u2019s views on Janet Yellen, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, seem to flipflop between disdain and admiration. During his election campaign, the president said she should be ashamed of herself for the Fed\u2019s policies, but later he praised her for doing a good job. But that does not mean he will give her another term once her current one is up in February. And perhaps ironically, the White House economic adviser and former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn is the favourite to replace Yellen. Ironic, because at the end of last week it was suggested that Cohn might quit his current post following Trump\u2019s much-criticised reaction to the events in Charlottesville. But a survey by the National Association for Business Economics \u2013 admittedly conducted before the violence in Charlottesville \u2013 showed a majority thought that Yellen would not be nominated for a second term. Of those who expected a different face at the top of the Fed, Cohn was by far the favourite. Bloomberg has the details here. The Total deal to buy Maersk Oil for $7.5bn will boost the French company\u2019s presence in the North Sea, making it the second largest player in the area. And it is not the only big deal in the sector today. Essar Oil has sold its India assets to a consortium led by Rosneft for $12.9bn. The deal will be the largest by a foreign company in India. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor said: The deal announced this morning between Total and Maersk Oil and completion of the Rosneft and Essar Oil deal confirm how Big Oil is having to look to consolidation to achieve access to additional capacity outside the US, having failed to invest in new production over the past few years. The collapse in oil prices from over $100 per barrel in May 2014 to under $30 in January 2016 forced oil companies to cut their spending to the bone and these decisions dramatically reduced future production. However, with a moderate recovery in oil prices and a significant improvement in cash flows, oil majors are on the prowl, looking to buy assets to improve production levels and deliver excess returns and profits. Sterling is just about holding steady against the other major currencies at the moment after its worst week since early June, but the currency remains under pressure. It is marginally lower against the dollar at $1.2870, having earlier fallen as low as $1.2851. Against the euro, it is up 0.1% at \u20ac1.0959. Investors are nervous about the progress of Brexit talks, while the chances of an imminent interest rate rise have been dropping sharply. Back with China\u2019s interest in Fiat Chrysler: German chancellor Angela Merkel has criticised bonuses for car executives in the wake of the emissions scandal in an interview with Bild. Reuters reports: Multi-million euro bonuses to German car company executives are not fair given the sector\u2019s tarnished image after the emissions scandal, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday. \u201cNo I don\u2019t think this is fair. I don\u2019t know how the automotive industry is going to respond,\u201d Merkel told mass-selling Bild newspaper in an interview broadcast live online. She added: \u201cThey have supervisory boards on which union representatives sit and I think there should be a more sensitive approach (to executive bonuses)\u201c. Merkel said it was not up to politicians to cap executive pay and bonuses. Earlier the German finance ministry said the scandal was a risk to the country\u2019s economy: Fiat Chrysler shares have accelerated 3% following reports that China\u2019s Great Wall Motor was interested in bidding for the carmaker. Reuters has quoted a Great Wall spokesman as saying, \u201cWe currently have an intention to acquire. We are interested in [Fiat Chrysler].\u201d The Chinese company is apparently particularly interested in Fiat\u2019s Jeep brand, and perhaps only Jeep. Automotive News quoted a spokesman saying: \u201cOur goal is to become the world\u2019s largest SUV [sports utility vehicle] maker. Acquiring Jeep, a global SUV brand, would enable us to achieve our goal sooner and better (than on our own).\u201d More on the Maersk Oil deal. Reuters reports: Total is buying Maersk Oil in a $7.45 billion deal which the French oil major said would boost its earnings and cash flow, and bolster its dividend prospects. Danish company AP Moller Maersk is selling its Maersk Oil division to Total to focus on other activities including its shipping business. Under the terms of the deal, A.P. Moller Maersk will get $4.95 billion in Total shares and Total will assume $2.5 billion of Maersk Oil\u2019s debt. Maersk said it plans to return a \u201cmaterial portion of the value of the received Total S.A. shares\u201d to shareholders in 2018 and 2019 in the form of extraordinary dividend, share buyback or distribution of shares in Total. The world\u2019s top oil companies have been back on the takeover trail over the last year, helped by signs of a recovery in the oil market. The sale comes with Maersk in the midst of a major restructuring to concentrate on its transport and logistics businesses and separate its energy operations in the face of a drop in income. \u201cThis transaction is immediately accretive to both cash flow and earnings per share and delivers further growth over coming years,\u201d said Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne in a statement. \u201cIt is in line with our announced strategy to take advantage of the current market conditions and of our stronger balance sheet to add new resources at attractive conditions,\u201d he added. BP announced a string of investments in the last two months of 2016, including a $1 billion partnership with Dallas-based Kosmos Energy in Mauritania and Senegal in West Africa, as well as acquisitions in Abu Dhabi and Azerbaijan. Total and Norway\u2019s Statoil have bought into Brazil\u2019s lucrative sub-salt deepwater oil fields while ExxonMobil Corp bought assets in Papua New Guinea to meet growing Asian demand for liquefied natural gas. In July, Total also said it was investing $3.5 billion over five years in Qatar\u2019s offshore Al Shaheen oilfield . Here\u2019s Danske Bank on the forthcoming Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers: ECB president Mario Draghi is set to be among the speakers for the first time in three years. In 2014, he hinted at QE and now the focus is on tapering signals. We expect him to deliver a dovish message and to not give any new communication on the issue of tapering of asset purchases. When it comes to the Fed, we do not expect anything dramatic. We look for a repeat of signals that the announcement on balance sheet reduction will come relatively soon (likely September) and that one more rate hike is still the base case this year \u2013 as signalled by vice president Bill Dudley last week. It is a key year for oil and gas companies, according to analysts at Barclays: We see the next 12 months as a critical period for the oil and gas industry and one that should see companies getting back to covering dividends and reducing debt organically. As such, over the coming year, we see competitive performance as a crucial determinant of value creation and this report is our annual assessment of the operational and financial performance of the integrated companies over a 25-year history. It allows us to align companies to differing quartiles of performance and assess whether they are appropriately valued. We conclude that there is still material value in the large cap oils, with our preference towards those stocks with lower break-evens and more potential to re-rate over the next 12 months. Our key overweight stocks are BP, Conoco, Exxon, OMV and Shell. News of a major oil deal has helped to limit some of the market falls. The Danish shipping company Moller-Maersk has announced it will sell its oil and gas division, Maersk Oil, to France\u2019s Total for $7.45bn. It plans to return a large part of the proceeds to shareholders, which has helped to push its shares up around 5%. As expected, investors appear to be keeping their powder dry at the start of the new trading week. In keeping with the gloomy weather in London at the moment, the FTSE 100 has dipped 0.1%, with banks among the biggest fallers. But mining shares are moving higher, with BHP Billiton leading the way ahead of its results on Tuesday. Elsewhere, Germany\u2019s Dax, France\u2019s Cac and Spain\u2019s Ibex all opened 0.5% lower, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.27%. The dollar has been under pressure recently, not least because of the car-crash that is US politics at the moment. It seems a bit calmer this morning, edging away from four month lows against the yen. But Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank, believes that any respite for the US currency could be short-lived: There is little love lost for the dollar right now, with the currency fast becoming a sell on the current White House drama. It is a bit strange to see both speculative and actual personnel changes within the White House causing such a stir for global markets, though we may be able to put this down to summer markets. Still, we prefer to focus on the broader economic implications of US politics and what this means for the dollar. In addition to diminishing odds of any pro-growth policies from the Trump administration, we believe the narrative is shifting towards political uncertainty having a dampening effect on business confidence and investment activity. Given that US political environment remains frenetic, the risk relief rally seen late on Friday may prove to be short-lived and this could well keep the dollar pinned down over the coming weeks. The pound meanwhile is edging lower against the dollar as the US currency stabilises for the moment. With the continuing uncertainty over Brexit terms, sterling is down 0.16% at $1.2850. Against the euro it is virtually unchanged at \u20ac1.0946. Oil is slipping back on worries that increasing US production could outweigh attempts by Opec to curb output and support crude prices. Brent is currently down 0.19% at $52.62 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, is 0.1% lower at $48.46. Traders will be keeping an eye on an Opec technical meeting today. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: [At the meeting] nations are expected to ensure compliance with output cuts to prevent prices from diving again. Satisfactory comments could encourage a further recovery in oil prices. In Asia the Nikkei 225 is down around 0.4%, and European markets are forecast to open lower: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are in a cautious mood amid continuing political tensions and ahead of a big week for central bankers. Worries about North Korea were put on the backburner last week amid the continuing turmoil at the White House and the terrorist attacks in Spain. But they could be back in focus with the US and South Korea holding military exercises this week. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: Europe is set for a slightly negative start on Monday, threatening to extend its losing streak to three sessions as political and geopolitical risk continue to weigh on risk appetite. Geopolitical risk could rear its ugly head again this week as the US and South Korea begin planned military exercises on Monday, just as tensions between the North and these two countries appear to have calmed. Should North Korea respond in kind, then we could see a repeat of the safe haven rush from a couple of weeks ago when the situation previously flared up between the countries. US markets closed lower for the second week in succession as President Trump faced criticism for his response to the events in Charlottesville. But news that his adviser Steve Bannon was leaving his role at the White House gave a late lift to Wall Street on Friday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: We did see a late rebound off the lows late on Friday when it was announced that Steve Bannon, one of President Trump\u2019s closest advisers, had left the administration. It was well known that there was tension amongst him and some other members of the president\u2019s top team, including chief economic adviser Gary Cohn. There had been some uncertainty surrounding the future of Cohn, in the wake of recent events in Charlottesville, and the president\u2019s failure unequivocally to condemn the violence of the far right, particularly given Cohn\u2019s own Jewish ancestry. The departure of Cohn would have been a hammer blow to the president, on top of all the other recent resignations, which suggests there may well have been a hint of political calculation behind Friday\u2019s events. Bannon\u2019s departure buys Trump time when he is starting to look isolated and even a little beleaguered. The big question is how we move on from here and whether the president still has the authority to move forward on any key policy areas, such as tax reform. There are indeed reports that Trump may now try and push through the long-promised tax reforms in an attempt to at least get some of his policies on the books. On the economic front, there is little to look forward to today. Most of the big news comes later in the week, not least with the Jackson Hole summit of central bankers in the US. Investors will be looking for any signs of further interest rate moves from the Fed, and any hints from the European Central Bank about a slow withdrawal of its bond buying programme. However, there have already been suggestions that the ECB president Mario Draghi is unlikely to say anything too informative. CMC\u2019s Hewson said: The scope for surprises was diminished somewhat by ECB sources at the end of last week when it was reported the ECB president Mario Draghi would not be making any comment on monetary policy when he speaks later this week. This reticence to comment may also have something to do with the fact that there appears to some concern on the governing council about an overshoot to the upside for the euro, particularly given the recent weakness of the US dollar. Here is our preview of the Jackson Hole event: Also on the agenda later in the week are French and German PPI numbers and the latest second quarter GDP figures from the UK.",

It seems a bit calmer this morning, edging away from four month lows against the yen. But Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank, believes that any respite for the US currency could be short-lived:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is little love lost for the dollar right now, with the currency fast becoming a sell on the current White House drama. It is a bit strange to see both speculative and actual personnel changes within the White House causing such a stir for global markets, though we may be able to put this down to summer markets. Still, we prefer to focus on the broader economic implications of US politics and what this means for the dollar.</p> <p>In addition to diminishing odds of any pro-growth policies from the Trump administration, we believe the narrative is shifting towards political uncertainty having a dampening effect on business confidence and investment activity. Given that US political environment remains frenetic, the risk relief rally seen late on Friday may prove to be short-lived and this could well keep the dollar pinned down over the coming weeks.</p> </blockquote> <p>The pound meanwhile is edging lower against the dollar as the US currency stabilises for the moment. With the continuing uncertainty over Brexit terms, sterling is down 0.16% at $1.2850.

But news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/18/steve-bannon-white-house-trump-administration\">his adviser Steve Bannon was leaving his role at the White House</a> gave a late lift to Wall Street on Friday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We did see a late rebound off the lows late on Friday when it was announced that Steve Bannon, one of President Trump\u2019s closest advisers, had left the administration. It was well known that there was tension amongst him and some other members of the president\u2019s top team, including chief economic adviser Gary Cohn.</p> <p>There had been some uncertainty surrounding the future of Cohn, in the wake of recent events in Charlottesville, and the president\u2019s failure unequivocally to condemn the violence of the far right, particularly given Cohn\u2019s own Jewish ancestry.</p> <p>The departure of Cohn would have been a hammer blow to the president, on top of all the other recent resignations, which suggests there may well have been a hint of political calculation behind Friday\u2019s events.</p> <p>Bannon\u2019s departure buys Trump time when he is starting to look isolated and even a little beleaguered. The big question is how we move on from here and whether the president still has the authority to move forward on any key policy areas, such as tax reform.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are indeed reports that Trump may now try and push through the long-promised tax reforms in an attempt to at least get some of his policies on the books.</p> <p>On the economic front, there is little to look forward to today. Most of the big news comes later in the week, not least with the Jackson Hole summit of central bankers in the US. Investors will be looking for any signs of further interest rate moves from the Fed, and any hints from the European Central Bank about a slow withdrawal of its bond buying programme. However, there have already been suggestions that the ECB president Mario Draghi is unlikely to say anything too informative. CMC\u2019s Hewson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The scope for surprises was diminished somewhat by ECB sources at the end of last week when it was reported the ECB president Mario Draghi would not be making any comment on monetary policy when he speaks later this week.</p> <p>This reticence to comment may also have something to do with the fact that there appears to some concern on the governing council about an overshoot to the upside for the euro, particularly given the recent weakness of the US dollar.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is our preview of the Jackson Hole event:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/20/global-investors-look-to-jackson-hole-for-signs-of-how-qe-will-end\">Global investors look to Jackson Hole for signs of how QE will end</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Also on the agenda later in the week are French and German PPI numbers and the latest second quarter GDP figures from the UK.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-21T07:05:59.992Z\">at 8.05am BST</time></p>  </div>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pay for Britain\u2019s top bosses has fallen by almost a fifth, suggesting companies may be reining in excessive rewards as the government reviews options for further reform. The median pay for chief executives at FTSE 100 companies, which includes bonuses and other long-term incentives, fell 19% to \u00a33.5m in 2016, from \u00a34.3m a year before, a survey by Deloitte found. Total pay fell as companies trimmed the amount bosses could earn from bonuses and share plans. Median salaries rose by about 2% but the number of salary increases of 3% or more halved. The coalition government introduced rules in 2013 that forced large public companies to put a three-year pay policy to a binding shareholder vote, report bosses\u2019 pay more clearly and show the relationship between the pay of the chief executive and the average worker. Theresa May promised to introduce further curbs when she campaigned for the Tory leadership last year. Critics said her proposals, published in November and still under review by ministers, were weaker than promised after lobbying by business. Stephen Cahill, Deloitte vice-chairman, said falling pay showed the existing rules were working because last year\u2019s packages were the first drawn up since the 2013 measures. Cahill said: \u201cThe fall in executive pay demonstrates that remuneration committees are making a real effort to address shareholder concerns. It seems to show that the current legislation is working.\u201d The Deloitte survey echoes a recent report by the High Pay Centre that calculated average chief executive pay fell 17% last year to \u00a34.5m. But that report said the average employee would have to work for 160 years to earn the annual pay of a FTSE 100 chief executive. Deloitte said the median amount bosses could earn as an annual bonus last year was 150% of salary \u2013 little changed for a decade. But at the biggest 30 companies the \u201cbonus opportunity\u201d fell from 200% to 185% of salary in the past four years. Amounts on offer under long-term share plans also fell. Public anger over bosses\u2019 pay increased during years of falling living standards for ordinary workers. Big shareholders responded by voting against pay deals, leading to a series of revolts at annual meetings last year before May made her pledge. Deloitte found a calmer set of shareholder meetings this year as nine in 10 FTSE 100 companies had more than 80% support on pay. But shareholders voted against pay reports at Pearson, the educational publisher, and Crest Nicholson, the builder.

      "bodyText": "Asking prices for homes in Northamptonshire have jumped by 9.1% over the past year, the biggest increase in England and Wales, Rightmove said today, as London\u2019s unaffordable property market has driven people to buy further away and commute. The property website said the asking price for homes coming on to the market in the county had risen by 2.2% in August, to an average of \u00a3256,642, making it the hottest area covered by the survey. The growth contrasts with a monthly fall of 1.9% in Greater London, and a 0.9% drop across England and Wales as a whole. Rightmove said counties across the middle of England were experiencing a \u201cmini-boom\u201d. Prices in Derbyshire rose 7.9% from a year ago and in Norfolk they were up 7.4%. Annual prices increased by about 7% in Nottinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Worcestershire, the West Midlands and Leicestershire. Yet they remain much lower than in London where, although the annual rise was only 1.6%, the average new asking price stands at \u00a3629,270. Miles Shipside, Rightmove director and housing market analyst, said: \u201cThe heat has come off much of the market. A combination of traditional summertime price blues and the chill of uncertainty in the air has cooled house price growth in some parts of the country and affordability remains very stretched.\u201d Years of rapid price increases have made London and the south unaffordable to many buyers, prompting them to look further afield. It takes less than an hour to travel from Northampton or Bedford to central London by train, while cities such as Birmingham and Norwich have buzzing business scenes. Shipside pointed out that the average house price in Derbyshire of \u00a3200,000 was less than a third of the average London price. He said property investors were turning their attention to the Midlands from London to get better returns. He said: \u201cWith a shortage of suitable choice in many parts of the country, buyers are becoming increasingly adept at hunting down property that fits their budget. High demand and limited supply are still driving momentum, especially in the counties in the middle of the country.\u201d Adam Wellesley, director of Horts estate agents in Northamptonshire, said the rise in prices was \u201clikely to be down to the close vicinity for commuters to get to London Euston, as you can now get there within 48 minutes\u201d. He said: \u201cYou can also get to Milton Keynes by train in 10 minutes, where prices are 20% higher than Northampton.\u201d Wellesley said the buy-to-let market was also buoyant, as investors were still managing to make returns of up to 10% on houses of multiple occupancy. Despite concerns about Brexit and the economy, house prices have continued to increase, though at a slower pace than in recent years. The market has been supported by a lack of supply and ultra-low interest rates, though the Bank of England has warned lenders about loose mortgage lending. Separate figures from Countrywide, Britain\u2019s biggest estate agent, suggest markets outside London will see higher price growth than the capital in 2017. By the end of the year, Countrywide expects prices to have risen by 3.5% in the east of England and 2.5% in the Midlands and north-west, while in greater London they will have flatlined and in central London they will be down by 1.5%. Bucking the trend will be prime central London \u2013 in the capital\u2019s costliest neighbourhoods, it said prices could grow by 2% after two years of falls. Countrywide predicted that across Great Britain house-price growth would fall to 1.5% this year from 5% in 2016 and that the market would wane early next year as economic conditions weaken and confidence is guided by Brexit talks. Fionnuala Earley, Countrywide\u2019s chief economist, said rising prices and interest rate increases would sap household spending power in the first half of next year, but after a rocky start growth would resume as wages start to rise, pushing prices up by 2% in 2018. However, she said: \u201cThe housing market is sensitive to confidence, which will be affected by the outcome of Brexit negotiations.\u201d Earley said there are not enough new houses in the pipeline to meet expected demand and that lack of supply would continue to support prices over the next two years. Annual price growth would accelerate to 3% in 2019 , she predicted.",
