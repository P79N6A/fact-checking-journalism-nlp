      "bodyText": "There have always been plenty of people interested in Kevin Leech, whose family own Land's End, the Snowdon mountain railway and Reliant cars [see footnote]. During the dotcom boom they came to learn the tactics that prompted him to become an early investor in internet stocks and propelled the Jersey-based businessman to be named as Britain's 17th richest person with an estimated fortune of \u00a31.2bn - as well as the first billionaire to emerge from an island stuffed full of tycoons. But since those halcyon days - and a now discharged bankruptcy dating back to 2002 - Leech has developed a reputation as an entirely different type of dealmaker \u2013 one who can promise 900% profits, almost instantaneously, for investing in pariah states. And who wouldn't be interested in that? The entrepreneur's re-emergence as a public figure came in 2009 as a major shareholder in First London, the collapsed investment bank that attracted national attention because of its links to convicted insurance fraudster Russell King, plus its role in the short-lived takeover of League Two football team Notts County. The lowly football league club sensationally signed Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson as its director of football, in return for paying the former England manager \u20ac11m (\u00a39m) of shares in a previously unknown First London client called Swiss Commodity Holding (SCH). The story became even more intriguing when it emerged SCH was claiming to own trillions of dollars worth of mining rights in North Korea and had taken Eriksson to a business meeting inside the \"axis of evil\". But SCH shares eventually proved worthless as it became embroiled in the \u00a3173m collapse of First London (see box). Some of the First London shareholders upset by the way their investment disintegrated are among the people now keen to be reacquainted with the tycoon.

Leech's lawyers say he now spends the majority of his time in Asia, as that is where his business interests are, though they insist \"Jersey remains his home\". But despite the geographical move, there are common themes with SCH, with documents suggesting his recent pitches seem to target millions of pounds from private investors on the back of North Korean mining licences.

      "bodyText": "Journalists and car enthusiasts from around the world descended upon Detroit for the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) this week, where some of the world\u2019s most prominent automakers \u2013 among them Ford, General Motors, and Toyota \u2013 released new designs for their most popular vehicles and previewed the cars of tomorrow. The vehicles were the main attraction, but there was still plenty at the convention for geeks of all stripes. Scattered among the gleaming trucks, sedans, and sports cars were more than a few weird embellishments, if only you know how to look. We sent our business reporter Dominic Rushe (@dominicru), who has a keen eye for weirdness, around the NAIAS floor to take photos and videos of all the odd items on display. We also gathered contributions from some of the quirkier auto enthusiasts on Twitter. Below, we present a small sample of the strange sights at NAIAS While all of the above items listed here are weird, nothing that follows will even come close to the absurdity and incongruousness of this pregnancy suit. Someone needs to tell this guy that he\u2019s not at the Consumer Electronics Show. The smart folks over at Bentley want you to stay connected in style with this utterly superfluous accessory. This handy feature allows you to post obnoxious status updates about how you\u2019re being chauffeured around in a Bentley. The team from BBC's Top Gear was at the auto show, and have also been on the lookout for strange sights. While most carmakers opted for turbocharged, hyperbolic presentations (we\u2019re looking at you, Ford), Mercedes used a more subtle approach to attract interest. Not far from the soothing tones of the violinist, attendees could also relax near an indoor forest. This thing isn't intended to be driven, right? \u2026 right? This model might be dressed futuristically, but the idea of using pretty women to sell cars isn\u2019t exactly a revolutionary idea. Yet with most of the human beauties on display were wearing a standard uniform of cocktail dresses and stilettos, we\u2019ve got to give props to this one for really committing. In case all the hot rods and pickup trucks aren\u2019t enough to make you feel manly, you can play pool on top of a classic car. And yet, not even a driver's paradise is safe from the encroaching grip of the Bicycle Lobby, which has clearly worked its nefarious magic on the US Labor Department: Well that's all we got for now. But he show lasts through next week, and we have a feeling the best is yet to come. Did you spot anything strange at NAIAS, like the guy you see below?

Price cuts from supermarkets and early Christmas discounting by over-stocked high street retailers helped matters.</p> <p>The downward trend is likely to continue. Core inflation, the cost of living minus increases in food and fuel prices, dipped from 1.8% to 1.7%, while the cost of goods leaving factory gates \u2013 an early sign of price pressures \u2013 was up 1% on year earlier. A stronger pound will bear down on the UK\u2019s bill for imports.</p> <p>It\u2019s pretty clear why this is good news for the chancellor. There are four key measures of how well the economy is doing at a big-picture level: jobs, inflation, trade and growth. At the moment, unemployment is coming down, inflation is falling, growth is robust and the trade deficit is stable, albeit uncomfortably large. Even an economy as riddled with structural problems as Britain\u2019s hits a sweet spot from time to time, and this is one of them.</p> <p>With an election just over a year away, Osborne is in the happy position of being able to say that the decisions he has taken are at last paying off. The likelihood is that 2014 will be as good as it gets, but given that 2014 is a pre-election year, the chancellor is in a much better place than he was 12 months ago, when all the talk was of a triple-dip recession.</p> <p>Carney\u2019s job is made a lot easier by falling price pressure. The unexpectedly rapid drop in joblessness has complicated things for the Bank of England, which said back in August that it would only start to mull over an increase in interest rates once unemployment has fallen to 7%. That now looks likely to happen imminently, much earlier than the 2016 date originally pencilled in by Threadneedle Street, but Carney and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee will now be able to say that on target inflation means shrinking dole queues are consistent with 0.5% borrowing costs. Interest rates remain on hold.</p> <p>As for the rest of us, the problem for the past few years has been that prices have been rising more rapidly than earnings. Real wages, the value of what our pay packets buy us after inflation is taken into account, are down by almost 8% since the start of 2009: a sizeable cut in living standards. Prices are still rising at double the rate of earnings but the gap is smaller than it was a year ago and there is a good chance that at some point in 2014 a tighter labour market and a further drift down in inflation will see real wages start to rise. It will, of course, take years to recoup the losses suffered over the past five years, which is why for the public dropping inflation is as yet only modestly good news.</p> </blockquote> <p> </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-14T11:13:20.427Z\">at 11.13am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52d5125ee4b01eb37ac10864\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-14T10:50:02.603Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics</strong> points out that some of this winter's energy price rises will be reversed this spring, once environmental levies are moved onto general taxation.</p> <p>Tombs also reckons that food price inflation will continue to ease in 2014, given that agricultural commodity prices fell last year, predicting:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>CPI inflation looks likely to spend more time below the 2% target than above it in 2014, helping real earnings to finally recover.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-01-14T10:50:08.659Z\">at 10.50am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52d51195e4b0df363f1b24ef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-14T10:31:06.275Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Howard Archer of IHS Global insight sums up the key details:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Inflation was primarily brought down in December by an appreciable moderation in the year-on-year increase in food and non-alcoholic drinks, as well as lower prices for recreational goods &amp; services.</p> <p>This outweighed a rise in petrol prices and a limited upward impact from gas and electricity prices.

      "bodyText": "Over in Greece the government has announced it had achieved the much-cherished target of posting a primary surplus last year which will, it says, make it eligible for debt relief. Helena Smith reports: After years of pain-staking spending cuts Greece\u2019s central government posted a primary budget surplus of just under \u20ac700m in 2013, Athens\u2019 deputy finance minister Christos Staikouras announced in parliament today. As prime minister Antonis Samaras prepared to fly to Strasbourg where he will formally unveil Greece\u2019s EU presidency plans to the European Parliament, Staikouras said the country was now on target to achieve a total primary budget surplus of around \u20ac812m, or 0.4% of gross domestic product at the general government level. Although general government data are not expected to be released for another month \u201call the indicators show that we will exceed our target,\u201d the minister said, adding that once that happened Athens would be in the market for serious debt relief consideration. With the country\u2019s debt burden at an untenable \u20ac360bn (more than 175% of GDP) officials say economic recovery will be high nigh impossible until the issue is resolved. Greece\u2019s EU partners and the International Monetary Fund, which have been keeping the nation afloat, have promised to broach the potentially explosive topic once Athens achieves a primary surplus. Samaras' fragile two-party coalition has pledged to redress slashed pensions and benefits for Greece\u2019s most vulnerable with the extra funds, but Staikouras as is the wont of all politicians in Greece these days avoided going into specifics. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back again tomorrow. Another Federal Reserve member has said the US central bank's $75bn a month bond buying programme should be wound down sooner than forecast. Philadelphi Fed president Charles Plosser, who will be a voting member this year, played down concerns about last week's disappointing jobs data, forecasting more economic growth and a further drop in unemployment in 2014. He said, as reported by Reuters: As we enter 2014, I think the bottom line is that the economy is on a firmer footing than it has been for the past several years. In December the Fed made the first move in cutting back its stimulus measures, trimming the bond buying programme by $10bn from $85bn a month. Outgoing Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has said the programme would be wound down in stages, and probably completed altogether by the end of 2014. But Plosser said: My preference would be that we conclude the purchases sooner than this. But I am glad that we have taken the first step on the path to ending the programme. European banks will not have to adjust the sovereign debt portfolios they hold to maturity to reflect current market rates, according to an ECB letter signed by president Mario Draghi. There had been concerns about how these sovereign bonds would be treated in this year's stress tests, and whether rating them at market value could put pressure on bank balance sheets. But the ECB letter, as reported by Reuters, said: Sovereign exposures, both held-to-maturity [HTM] and available-for-sale exposures, will be included in the stress test although it is not foreseen that HTM portfolios will be marked-to-market. After early falls in the wake of an overnight drop on Wall Street, European markets have recovered to end the day on a more positive note. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: While last night\u2019s US sell-off seemed to imply that some investors have concerns about high valuations in US markets, European markets have been remarkably more sanguine, despite some early weakness in opening trade, stocks have pared the worst losses after some positive Eurozone industrial production data for November showed a much larger rise than markets had anticipated. So the closing scores were as follows: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 9.71 points or 0.14% higher at 6766.86 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.32% to 9540.51 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.26% higher at 4274.20 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB rose 0.17% to 19,730.38 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended up 0.16% at 10,382.0 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.48% or 77 points higher. Spain may sell part of its stake in bailed out Bankia in the first quarter of this year, Reuters reports: While no decision has yet been made, the economy ministry has recently stepped up contacts with bankers over the possible sale, the sources said. The state would probably look at selling no more than 18.4%, keeping a majority stake so that the bank's restructuring can be completed by 2017 as agreed with the European Union, they added. And here's the question observers were waiting for: Is Valerie Trierweiler still France's first lady? Hollande plays the privacy card and does not answer directly. See live blog here. Ahead of the questions: Francois Hollande has begun his speech, and is concentrating on economic matters so far, saying France must produce more and better, and announcing measures to reduce taxes on companies. Follow our live blog here. After Monday's sell-off, partly on comments from a Federal Reserve member suggesting the US central bank would continue trimming its bond buying programme despite weak jobs data, Wall Street has made a recovery in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 44 points or 0.3% after better than expected retail sales for December and a positive reaction to JP Morgan's figures (see earlier). Over in France, Francois Hollande is preparing to give his New Year's speech to the press. Until a few days ago, this was likely to concentrate on the economy, as the country struggles to pull out of recession amid heavy public spending and high taxation. All very worthy and perhaps it would have packed the house out, who knows. But many of those now gathered to listen to Hollande will be waiting for the president's comments on rather spicier matters, following a report in celebrity magazine Closer claiming he was having an affair with actress Julie Gayet. If you want to follow the economic debate, or indeed the other issues which may be discussed, we are live-blogging the event here: Francois Hollande press conference on economy and affair Back with the UK, and Paddy Power has issued its odds for the timing of the next interest rate rise, with the betting on later rather than sooner: 8/1 first half of 2014 11/2 second half of 2014 11/4 first half of 2015 5/2 second half of 2015 7/4 2016 or later But there was better news from the Republic, reports Henry: Ireland has exceeded EU predictions for industrial growth with the Republic increasing its production levels by 13.2% in November 2013 from the year before. Irish industrial production was the highest in the EU according to the latest Eurostat results on this sector of the economy. The Irish performance contrasted sharply to the other EU states that were bailed out during the eurozone crisis with Greece suffering the largest decline in industrial output and Spain showing a very small increase in production. Meanwhile one of the conditions the IMF and the ECB imposed on Ireland as a price for financial rescue was to drive down its massive public sector wage and cost bill. Even post-bail out the Irish government - in its desire to still be seen as the 'poster child' of the EU - vowed today to save a further \u20ac500m in public spending. Brendan Howlin, one of the Irish ministers who jointly announced Ireland's exit from the bail out programme in December, said the savings would be made by changing state procurement practices and slashing the pay roll. Northern Ireland had the lowest footfall of customers during the Christmas shopping period in the whole of the UK. Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald writes: Spending in shops during the festive period was almost 9 per cent lower than the previous Christmas. The figures from the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium showed the drop in spending was nearly 7% more than the overall drop across the UK of 2.4%. Aside from the recession in the province traders in cities such as Belfast also had to bear the brunt of ongoing loyalist flag protests in the commercial heart of the city including key shopping days coming up to Christmas. In addition there was a flurry of bomb attacks by dissident republicans in Belfast city centre as well as a series of bomb alerts on main arterial routes into the commercial district during the festive season. As well as political violence and Northern Ireland having one of the lowest incomes per head of population in the UK, retailers say there was a surge in on line purchasing before Christmas. Glyn Roberts, of the Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association, described the figures as \"disappointing.\" He said: \"An 8.7% decline is a major cause for concern and we are surprised as a number of our members had reported an increase in footfall and sales in December.\" The Northern Ireland Retail Consortium's Aodh\u00e1n Connolly said: \"It's deeply concerning to see that Northern Ireland suffered by far the steepest drop in footfall in December, especially after some tentative signs that growth was starting to go the other direction in November. US retail sales for December came in higher than expected, helping to push Wall Street futures higher in the expectation the economy would continue to strengthen. According to the Commerce Department, retail sales excluding cars, fuel, building materials and food services, rose 0.7% last month, following a 0.2% rise in November and better than the 0.3% rise forecast by economists. But if this so-called core figure was better than expected, overall sales grew by just 0.2% given a large decline in sales of automobiles, mainly due to the cold weather. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: US retail sales came in at a modest 0.2% month on month in December from a downward revised 0.4% the prior month. The outcome for the December print is a touch stronger than expected. We projected retail sales to have remained flat in December following a solid 0.7% gain in November. The downward revision for the latter leaves the overall picture for the fourth quarter of 2013 in line with expectations. On a three month annualized basis, retail sales accelerated to 4.2% from 3.5% in November. However, the fourth quarter pace of growth for retail activity is a touch below the third quarter outcome. James Knightley at ING said: With consumer confidence improving and the general state of the economy looking in decent shape, notwithstanding the soft payrolls number last Friday, we remain upbeat on consumer spending prospects and look for the US economy to grow by 3% this year and the Fed taper to continue through to 4Q. Another Wall Street bank, Wells Fargo, has beaten forecasts with a 10% jump in fourth-quarter profits. It made $5.6bn, or $1 per share, in the last three months of 2013. And on that note, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Our City editor Jill Treanor has digested today's fourth-quarter and full-year results from JP Morgan, and flags up that average pay rose across the bank last year despite the stream of legal charges and bills. She reports: A wave of legal costs and regulatory penalties have dented the profitability of America\u2019s biggest bank JP Morgan and ended a run of record profits. Becoming the first major US bank to report its results for last year - Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America report later this week - JP Morgan admitted its full year profits had fallen 16% to $18bn after a year in which has paid out penalties of around $20bn in total. The fines have related to the subprime mortgage crisis and its London Whale trading incident in 2012 and Jamie Dimon, who is both chairman and chief executive of the bank, said he was pleased to put \u201csome significant issues behind us this quarter\u201d after reaching settlements with regulators. The bank revealed that despite the profits slump the average pay for its 251,000 staff was $122,653 in 2013 - up from $118,000 a year earlier - although within its investment banking arm the average pay was $207,368, down 5% on 2012. The most recent was last week when it paid a record $2bn to settle charges it had knowingly ignored evidence that convicted fraudster Bernard Madoff\u2019s massive Ponzi scheme was \u201ctoo good to be true.\u201d \u201cIt was in the best interests of our company and shareholders for us to accept responsibility, resolve these issues and move forward. This will allow us to focus on what we are here for: serving our clients and communities around the world. We remained focused on building our four leading franchises, which all continued to deliver strong underlying performance, for the quarter and the year,\u201d he said. In the fourth quarter profits fell by 7% to $5.3bn after taking a knock from $1.1bn of legal expenses. But in the third quarter the bank had slumped to its first quarterly loss under Dimon as a result of $9.2bn of legal expenses. Over on Wall Street, JP Morgan's legal travails have hit its profits again -- and its investment bank didn't have a great quarter either. JP Morgan kicked off the bank reporting season by announcing that its net income slid by 7% in the last quarter, down to $5.28bn from $5.69bn a year ago. The results are complicated by the company's latest brushes with regulators -- it just agreed to pay $1.7bn (\u00a31bn) to compensate victims of the Bernard Madoff fraud, the latest in a stream of legal bills. CEO Jamie Dimon argued that the bank has made progress dealing with its problems. saying: We are pleased to have made progress on our control, regulatory and litigation agendas and to have put some significant issues behind us this quarter. Skimming the results, JPM's consumer banking division had a good quarter -- profits on mortgage banking rose 34%. Investment bank profits tumbled by 57%, although if various one-off accountancy changes are excluded they dropped by a less dramatic 11%. There are also signs of a slowdown on the trading desks -- fixed income (ie bonds) revenue dropped to $3.2bn, from $4.08bn. Equity markets revenue (such as share trading) fell to $873 million, from $1.3 billion a year earlier. Speaking of London house prices.... we have fresh evidence, not that we needed it, that London's super-rich remain untouched by the cost of living squeeze. A new tower block is to be thrown up alongside The Shard*, to provide accommodation for well-heeled workers in the Capital. And as fastFT flags up, there are 10 apartments up for sale within The Shard itself, \"rumoured to be priced at \u00a350m each.\" Not clear that any have been sold yet, but the developers must be confident of demand if they're building another (smaller) tower next door. The FT's Kate Allen wrote: The new tower, being unveiled at a public consultation today, will include 150 apartments and retail space, as well as a roof garden. The project is being developed by Sellar Property Group in partnership with the state of Qatar. * - which offers astoundingly beautiful views, only partly because you can't see the Shard from inside While the headline inflation rate eased back to 2.0%, house prices have been rising more than twice as fast, according to fresh data this morning. Strong demand in the south of England drove average house prices up by 5.3% over the last year, the ONS reported. First-time buyers were hit harder, paying 6.4% more than in 2012. My colleague Hilary Osborne reports: The Office for National Statistics said that new entrants to the housing market paid an average of \u00a3187,000 during the month \u2013 \u00a314,000 more than in the same month of 2012. The average price paid by movers was higher, at \u00a3284,000, which was 5.3% up on 12 months previously, while the average increase across the board was 5.4%. And London prices led the way, rising by 11.6%. More here: House prices up across the UK, says ONS Here's our news story on today's fall in inflation: Inflation finally falls to Bank of England's 2% target A recap for new readers. \u2022 Britain's inflation rate has finally returned to the government's 2% target, bringing some relief to households and businesses after the long squeeze on living standards. The Office for National Statistics reported that prices, as measured by the consumer prices index, rose by just 2.0% annually in December. It's the lowest rate since late 2009, and means inflation is in line with the Bank of England's goal. \u2022 Food prices rose by less, the ONS said, while the cost of toys and computer games dropped - suggesting heavy discounting by shops in the run-up to Christmas. This pushed down CPI, despite energy bills rising as the first winter tariffs hit customers. \u2022 The government hailed the news, with a Treasury spokesman saying that easing inflation meant the UK economy was recovering. Prime minister David Cameron tweeted that hard working families -- a key target demographic for Westminster -- were benefitting. \u2022 But real wages are continuing to shrink, given average pay packets are rising by less than 1%. Labour warned that more needs to be done to help families, such as an energy price freeze and making more free childcare available for working parents. Catherine McKinnell MP, shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, insists that today's inflation data is no reason to celebrate, given the ongoing cost of living crisis faced by many. This small fall in the inflation rate is welcome, but with prices still rising more than twice as fast as wages the cost-of-living crisis continues. After three damaging years of flatlining, working people are on average \u00a31600 a year worse off under the Tories. \u2022 Business leaders welcomed the news, with the BCC arguing that there's no need for the Bank of England to bow to pressure for an early rate rise. \u2022 But as Larry Elliott, our economics editor points out, today's big winners are George Osborne and BoE governor Mark Carney. Most people have suffered a hefty fall in real income since the crisis began -- real wages need to turn positive before the damage can be repaired. Today's drop in the Consumer Prices Index to 2% is particularly welcome because high inflation had become the \"new normal\", says Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. Sentance (a former interest-rate setter at the Bank of England) warns that inflationary pressure could intensify through the year. \ufeffIt\u2019s no coincidence that the fall in inflation over the past year has accompanied a pick-up in growth. Lower price increases ease the squeeze on consumers and allow them to increase spending. Now that inflation has returned to target, the challenge will be to keep it there. Stronger growth here in the UK could push up wage costs and a rebound in the global economy is likely to push up energy, food and commodity prices once again. So we cannot be sure that this return to the inflation target will be sustained through 2014. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes that today's fall in the UK inflation rate to the official target of 2.0% for the first time since 2009 is good for chancellor George Osborne and Bank of England governor Mark Carney. It's \"moderately good for the rest of us\", he adds. Falling inflation is welcome news for the Tories with an election around the corner, and also takes pressure off Carney to raise interest rates. But years of high inflation have made a serious dent in living standards - today's inflation data doesn't fix that. Larry says: The small decline last month from the 2.1% recorded in November doesn\u2019t sound much, but December saw an increase in petrol prices and the first tranche of price hikes from the \u201cBig 6\u201d energy companies. Price cuts from supermarkets and early Christmas discounting by over-stocked high street retailers helped matters. The downward trend is likely to continue. Core inflation, the cost of living minus increases in food and fuel prices, dipped from 1.8% to 1.7%, while the cost of goods leaving factory gates \u2013 an early sign of price pressures \u2013 was up 1% on year earlier. A stronger pound will bear down on the UK\u2019s bill for imports. It\u2019s pretty clear why this is good news for the chancellor. There are four key measures of how well the economy is doing at a big-picture level: jobs, inflation, trade and growth. At the moment, unemployment is coming down, inflation is falling, growth is robust and the trade deficit is stable, albeit uncomfortably large. Even an economy as riddled with structural problems as Britain\u2019s hits a sweet spot from time to time, and this is one of them. With an election just over a year away, Osborne is in the happy position of being able to say that the decisions he has taken are at last paying off. The likelihood is that 2014 will be as good as it gets, but given that 2014 is a pre-election year, the chancellor is in a much better place than he was 12 months ago, when all the talk was of a triple-dip recession. Carney\u2019s job is made a lot easier by falling price pressure. The unexpectedly rapid drop in joblessness has complicated things for the Bank of England, which said back in August that it would only start to mull over an increase in interest rates once unemployment has fallen to 7%. That now looks likely to happen imminently, much earlier than the 2016 date originally pencilled in by Threadneedle Street, but Carney and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee will now be able to say that on target inflation means shrinking dole queues are consistent with 0.5% borrowing costs. Interest rates remain on hold. As for the rest of us, the problem for the past few years has been that prices have been rising more rapidly than earnings. Real wages, the value of what our pay packets buy us after inflation is taken into account, are down by almost 8% since the start of 2009: a sizeable cut in living standards. Prices are still rising at double the rate of earnings but the gap is smaller than it was a year ago and there is a good chance that at some point in 2014 a tighter labour market and a further drift down in inflation will see real wages start to rise. It will, of course, take years to recoup the losses suffered over the past five years, which is why for the public dropping inflation is as yet only modestly good news. Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics points out that some of this winter's energy price rises will be reversed this spring, once environmental levies are moved onto general taxation. Tombs also reckons that food price inflation will continue to ease in 2014, given that agricultural commodity prices fell last year, predicting: CPI inflation looks likely to spend more time below the 2% target than above it in 2014, helping real earnings to finally recover. Howard Archer of IHS Global insight sums up the key details: Inflation was primarily brought down in December by an appreciable moderation in the year-on-year increase in food and non-alcoholic drinks, as well as lower prices for recreational goods &amp; services. This outweighed a rise in petrol prices and a limited upward impact from gas and electricity prices. Core inflation dipped to 1.7% in December from 1.8% in November. As mentioned at 10.01am, the full impact of the latest round of inflation-busting gas and electricity price rises have not yet been felt in the inflation data. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), hopes that calls for the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates will relent, now that inflation is finally on target: It is good news to see inflation fall to its 2% target for the first time since 2009, and should ease the pressure on businesses and consumers. With inflation likely to remain at these levels during most of 2014, the unjustified demand in some quarters for interest rate increases should relent. In the meantime, the MPC needs to maintain its two-pronged approach with forward guidance on interest rates, and a continued commitment to keeping inflation at its 2% target. Here's a round-up of instant Twitter reaction to the news that the UK consumer prices index has fallen to 2%, the Bank of England's target, for the first time in over four years. David Cameron tweets.... Here's more details of today's inflation data: The latest figures showed the usual month-on-month rise in the cost of food and alcoholic beverages from November to December was the smallest it has been since 2006. It meant the annual rate of inflation in the sector slowed to 1.9%, the lowest rate since May 2010, indicating an easing in the usual pressure on household Christmas budgets. Main downward contributions to this came from fruit and meat, while the price of fish was lower in December compared with November. Meanwhile coffee, tea and cocoa were cheaper last month than they were the year before, though inflation for bread and cereals accelerated. Games, toys and hobbies also saw price falls as Christmas approached, with reductions in computer games made for older platforms. Rising petrol prices had an upward effect on inflation, but the increase in the rate of air fares was lower than in 2012. (via PA). Labour MP Catherine McKinnell MP, shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, insists that today's inflation data is no reason to celebrate, given the ongoing cost of living crisis faced by many. \u201cThis small fall in the inflation rate is welcome, but with prices still rising more than twice as fast as wages the cost-of-living crisis continues. After three damaging years of flatlining, working people are on average \u00a31600 a year worse off under the Tories. \u201cWhat we need is Labour's plan to tackle the cost-of-living crisis and earn our way to higher living standards for the many and not just a few. \u201cLabour would freeze energy bills until 2017 while we reform the energy market, make work pay by expanding free childcare for working parents and get at least 200,000 homes built a year by 2020. \u201cBy opposing all these measures and giving a huge tax cut to people earning over \u00a3150,000 David Cameron has shown he only stands up for a privileged few.\u201d Today's data may not show the full effect of the winter increases in energy bills. The Office for National Statistics says: The first tranche of the expected winter price increases for gas and electricity entered the index this month. The overall size of the price increase in December 2013 was slightly larger than a year earlier resulting in a small upward contribution to inflation. The latest inflation data is online here. Duncan Weldon of the TUC is swift to point out that real wages are still falling. An inflation rate of 2% may be \"on target\", but with real wages growth of under 1% it means incomes are still shrinking. This graph shows how Britain's inflation rate has run over the Bank of England's 2% target for most of the last decade -- topping 5% in both 2008 and 2011. That was a principle cause of the squeeze on living standards, given wage growth was so modest once the financial crisis began. Here's the key points on today's UK inflation data, confirming that food prices pushed the cost of living down, countering the rise in energy bills. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) grew by 2.0% in the year to December 2013, down from 2.1% in November. The largest contributions to the fall in the rate came from prices for food &amp; non-alcoholic beverages and recreational goods &amp; services. These were partially offset by an upward contribution from motor fuels. The overall price increase for gas and electricity in December 2013 was slightly larger than the rises a year earlier resulting in a small upward contribution to inflation. The UK Treasury has welcomed the news that UK inflation has, at last, dropped to 2%. A HM Treasury Spokesperson said: Today\u2019s data - which show inflation has returned to its target and fallen to its lowest level for four years - is another sign that the government\u2019s long term economic plan is working. But the job is not done and times remain tough for many people. So an important part of the government\u2019s plan is helping hardworking people be more financially secure by increasing the tax free personal allowance and freezing fuel duty and council tax. This is the first time since 2009 that the UK inflation rate has hit the official target of 2% mandated by the Treasury. The Office for National Statistics reported that prices rose by just 0.4% month-on-month in December. Inflation was pushed down by lower food and recreation costs, while energy costs rose during the month (as higher fuel tariffs hit consumers). It's a welcome surprise -- City economists had expected the Consumer Prices Index to remain at 2.1%. The other measure of inflation, the Retail Prices Index, came in at 2.7% The news has sent the pound falling back to $1.641, having mysteriously jumped before the news broke. Breaking: UK inflation has fallen to 2.0%, the Bank of England's official target. Interesting newsflash on Reuters.... 14-Jan-2014 09:27 - STERLING RISES TO $1.6445 FROM $1.6413 AHEAD OF UK INFLATION DATA Top hats off to Moss Bros too -- the once-struggling purveyor of formalwear has promised shareholders an increased dividend after growing sales by almost 13% in the final four months of 2013. And it could also emulate ASOS's success online, with Cantor Fitzgerald retail analyst Freddie George saying: \"The major attraction of the company is the potential for the development of the retail online platform\". Assuming you already know your vital measurements, I guess.... Online clothing retailer ASOS has underlined the power of the Internet by reporting a 38% jump in sales over the Christmas trading period. It's relentless focus on celebrities, and the endorsement of Samantha Cameron, also helped, writes my colleague Sean Farrell: Asos targets \"fashion-forward twenty-somethings\" keen to emulate the styles of celebrities such as Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne. David Cameron's forty-something wife Samantha wore a \u00a342 Asos dress to watch the prime minister's conference speech in October. Asos unveils strong Christmas trading with sales up 38% The Libor rate-rigging scandal has taken another twist, with three former Rabobank traders being charged in the US with plotting to manipulate the global interest rate. Paul Robson, a Briton, Paul Thompson, an Australian, Tetsuya Motomura of Japan were charged on Monday with conspiracy to commitwire fraud and bank fraud, as well as two counts of wire fraud, according to a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court. None of the men are in US custody, a court official said. Three Rabobank traders charged in US with five-year plot to fix Libor The UK inflation rate is expected to remain at a four-year low of 2.1% in December (we get the official data in under hour's time,), which would mean the squeeze on real wages continues. Economics reporter Katie Allen explains that while energy bills went up last month, prices in the shops were cut as retailers tried to lure customers: Deep pre-Christmas discounting and a slowdown in food price rises will probably have offset energy bill hikes and left inflation relatively benign last month, economists said. Official data due on Tuesday morning is expected to show inflation held at November's four-year low of 2.1%, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll of economists. The highest estimate of the consumer price index measure (CPI) is for 2.3% and the lowest for 1.8%, which would mark the first reading below the Bank of England's 2% target since November 2009. The wider retail price index (RPI) measure, which includes housing costs and is typically used to set pay deals, is expected to tick up to 2.7% from 2.6% in November. Here's her preview: Inflation expected to hold steady at four-year low The big corporate news overnight was that US media giant Time Warner Cable had rejected a hostile takeover bid worth $37bn (or more than $60bn if you include debt). The bid, from billionaire John Malone's Charter Communications, could kick off a lively battle for the future of Time Warner. Here's the full story: Time Warner Cable: Charter goes hostile with $37bn bid Markets are fell because more hawkish members of the US Federal Reserve have indicated that they are still keen to cut back on the US stimulus programme, despite last weak's jobs data showing a worrying rise in American's quitting the labour market altogether. So argues CMC's Michael Hewson, who writes: Since Friday\u2019s disappointing payrolls report we\u2019ve heard from a number of Fed policymakers who insisted that any decision to taper further would not be swayed by last week\u2019s numbers with Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart following St. Louis Fed member James Bullard by saying that he would continue to support further reductions in stimulus. This seems to have accounted for the sharp sell-off seen late yesterday evening which saw the S&amp;P500 post its worst day in two months, as the dial starts to shift away from what had been until recently a one way bet on stock markets. Given that this year\u2019s voting members now include the rather more hawkish Dallas Fed\u2019s Richard Fisher and Charles Plosser of the Philadelphia Fed, the prospect of another reduction of stimulus at the end of this month, set against rather lofty valuations has seen investors decide to take some money off the table in a week that sees US earnings start to come in thick and fast starting with JP Morgan this afternoon. Given that Plosser and Fisher are also due to speak later this afternoon on the economic outlook it probably won\u2019t take a genius to figure out that they could well be hawkish in any comments they make with respect to stimulus reduction, and this could well have been another factor behind yesterday\u2019s weakness, along with Goldman Sachs suggesting that markets could be in line for a 10% correction. It's a broad-based selloff in London this morning. All but four members of the FTSE 100 have lost ground, but there are no huge fallers. Here's the worst performers so far: European stock markets are in the red at the start of trading, following the Nikkei's 3.1% slide earlier today. The FTSE 100 fell 0.8%, shedding around 55 points to 6702. There are bigger losses on the German DAX, which fell 1.3% in early trading., while the Spanish and Italian markets are down around 1%. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, says that the selloff is partly due to: Increased concern over US equity valuations ahead ofQ4 earnings season derived from a Goldman Sachs report stating that the S&amp;P 500 multiples were lofty by almost any measure and more expansion will be difficult to achieve. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and the business world. A hefty selloff in Japan has seen the Nikkei suffer its biggest one-day fall in five months, as investors appear to suffer a wobble in confidence. Japanese traders were in bearish mood today, with the Nikkei shedding 489 points, or almost 3.1%, to a one-month low of 15,422 as traders ditched shares after last night's tumble on Wall Street. As IG's Chris Weston puts it: The Nikkei has been savaged, with the index playing catch up after being closed yesterday. Yesterday's rally in the yen (when Japanese stock traders were on holiday) hit exporters. Australia's ASX 200 fared little better, sliding 1.5% as its mining and resource stocks took a hammering (many losing over 5%). While gold has risen near a one-month high, around $1,252 per ounce. And share are expected to drop in Europe this morning -- with the main indices being called down around 0.8%. So what happened? Well, there's no single trigger overnight, but investors appear to be more jittery about company profits as US corporate reporting season kicks off in earnest today (with JP Morgan, America's largest bank, publishing results). Cr\u00e9dit Agricole suggested that: Worries ahead of fourth quarter earnings releases and perhaps concerns about the economy in the wake of the disappointing US December jobs report weighed on US equities overnight. Several mid-size firms posted unimpressive results yesterday (see SodaStream's profit warning) - so those who argued that the markets had got ahead of themselves are feeling rather vindicated. Especially after Goldman Sachs analysts warned yesterday that the US S&amp;P 500 index was too high and almost certain to fall (and when Goldman says it, people tend to listen). One Paris-based trader told Reuters that the markets are bracing for a chilly dose of realism: We've been focusing a lot on macro data, but the real test is coming, with the earnings season starting, and the market might have been too optimistic about earnings recovery. And Friday's weak US jobs data seems to have finally sunk in, causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to shed 1.1% last night: Ian Williams of Peel Hunt commented: The major indices seemed to suffer a delayed reaction to the payrolls report, with the markdown accelerating late in the session and ending in the worst daily losses since 7 November. So, it could be a lively day ahead -- with all eyes on JP Morgan around lunchtime UK time. We also get the latest UK inflation data at 9.30am -- a month ago, the CPI fell surprisingly to 2.1%, easing the pressure on the Bank of England over its loose monetary policy. And Francois Hollande is due to give a big speech on his economic programme later today, outlining how he will tackle problems in the French economy. The president may have other things on his mind, though..... Michael Hewson of CMC Markets points out: In Europe the French President Francois Hollande is due to give a press conference outlining his plans to try and revive the weak French economy. Unfortunately for him the media are more likely to be interested in details of his private life after weekend revelations of an alleged affair with an actress. We'll be tracking the main events through the day...",

Garner said the figures did not back up Morrisons' claim that the chain had been hit harder by competition from discount chains Aldi and Lidl than its major rivals such as Tesco or Sainsbury's.</p> <p>He said the evidence was that Morrisons was suffering because of its focus on large supermarkets. \"Morrisons barely has any convenience stores and has only just gone online so in effect it was not in the two fastest grocery channels,\" he said.</p> <p>Garner said the latest figures indicated that both Tesco and Asda saw sales fall in their large stores, although Sainsbury's continued to see growth. Morrisons finally launched its internet service in Warwickshire on Friday in partnership with Ocado, hoping to reboot sales after a dismal festive season forced it to issue a profit warning last week.</p> <p>Kantar figures made clear that discounters Aldi and Lidl were the big winners over Christmas.

Underlying sales rose 1.5% at the retailer which is tipped to float on the stock market this year.</p> <h2>Oasis owner Aurora's sales rise</h2> <p>Aurora Fashions Group, the owner of clothing chains Oasis, Warehouse and Coast, saw sales at stores open more than a year rise 3.4% in the five weeks to January 4 as investments in integrating its stores and online shop paid off.</p> <p>Derek Lovelock, head of the group, which is largely owned by the administators of the Icelandic bank Kaupthing, said profit margins had also risen 2.7% as better technology meant the retailer could direct its entire pool of stock to shoppers however they wanted to buy. News of Aurora's Christmas trading comes as it emerged that losses at Aurora shrank to \u00a39m in the year to March 2013 from \u00a313.6m a year before as sales rose 1.4% to \u00a3412.5m. The losses were partly the result of a tough 2012 for the Oasis chain, the cost of investments in online infrastructure and nearly \u00a33m in interest charges. The retailer cut its debts from \u00a345m to \u00a339m over the year.</p> <p>Aurora is set to split into two parts later this year when Coast, the occasionwear chain, will go it alone.</p>",

Ed Garner, director at Kantar, said Morrisons' lack of an online store was a key factor in its 1% slump in grocery sales during the period. Garner said the figures did not back up Morrisons' claim that the chain had been hit harder by competition from discount chains Aldi and Lidl than its major rivals such as Tesco or Sainsbury's. He said the evidence was that Morrisons was suffering because of its focus on large supermarkets. \"Morrisons barely has any convenience stores and has only just gone online so in effect it was not in the two fastest grocery channels,\" he said. Garner said the latest figures indicated that both Tesco and Asda saw sales fall in their large stores, although Sainsbury's continued to see growth. Morrisons finally launched its internet service in Warwickshire on Friday in partnership with Ocado, hoping to reboot sales after a dismal festive season forced it to issue a profit warning last week. Kantar figures made clear that discounters Aldi and Lidl were the big winners over Christmas. Aldi grabbed nearly 1% more market share compared with a year before as sales rose by nearly 30% while Lidl's sales rose 17.5% and tiny Farm Foods, the frozen food chain, achieved a stellar 41.9% growth rate. Sainsbury's was the only one of the major supermarkets to hold its share of the market year-on-year as strong growth online and at its large chain of convenience stores as well as a good reputation on food quality helped it fight back against the discounters. As more shoppers choose to buy bulky goods online and then top up at handy local stores, convenience store group McColls also said it had enjoyed a good Christmas. Underlying sales rose 1.5% at the retailer which is tipped to float on the stock market this year. Oasis owner Aurora's sales rise Aurora Fashions Group, the owner of clothing chains Oasis, Warehouse and Coast, saw sales at stores open more than a year rise 3.4% in the five weeks to January 4 as investments in integrating its stores and online shop paid off. Derek Lovelock, head of the group, which is largely owned by the administators of the Icelandic bank Kaupthing, said profit margins had also risen 2.7% as better technology meant the retailer could direct its entire pool of stock to shoppers however they wanted to buy. News of Aurora's Christmas trading comes as it emerged that losses at Aurora shrank to \u00a39m in the year to March 2013 from \u00a313.6m a year before as sales rose 1.4% to \u00a3412.5m. The losses were partly the result of a tough 2012 for the Oasis chain, the cost of investments in online infrastructure and nearly \u00a33m in interest charges. The retailer cut its debts from \u00a345m to \u00a339m over the year. Aurora is set to split into two parts later this year when Coast, the occasionwear chain, will go it alone.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inflation unexpectedly fell in December, returning to the Bank of England's 2% target for the first time in four years. A smaller rise in food prices compared with a year earlier offset a rise in petrol prices and the well publicised increases in gas and electricity bills. High-street discounting in the weeks before Christmas also helped lower the inflation rate, economists said, with toy and computer game prices falling . The surprise fall drove the consumer prices index to its lowest level since November 2009, when it stood at 1.9%, the Office for National Statistics reported. Inflation has fallen sharply since June's high of 2.9%, and economists had expected it to remain unchanged last month at November's 2.1%. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said inflation was likely to remain \"close to, if not below, the 2% target for some time to come\". The fall in CPI inflation will be a source of relief for the Bank's monetary policy committee, under pressure to justify its ultra-loose policy stance despite economic growth and falling unemployment in recent months. Interest rates have been on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009. \"Talk of higher rates has increased in recent weeks because the Bank of England has been wrong-footed by the strength of the economy,\" Williamson said. A Treasury spokesman said the fall was \"another sign that the government's long-term economic plan is working\". He added: \"But the job is not done and times remain tough for many people. So an important part of the government's plan is helping hard-working people be more financially secure by increasing the tax-free personal allowance and freezing fuel duty and council tax.\" Consumers will be hoping that lower inflation will raise the prospect of higher wages, which have been persistently outpaced by rising prices. Catherine McKinnell, the shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, said that for now, household budgets in Britain remained under pressure: \"This small fall in the inflation rate is welcome, but with prices still rising more than twice as fast as wages the cost of living crisis continues. After three damaging years of flatlining, working people are on average \u00a31,600 a year worse off under the Tories.\" Average annual wage growth, in the three months to October \u2013 the latest official data \u2013 was up 0.9%. The retail prices index, more broadly based than CPI and often used as a guide for wage bargaining, rose to 2.7% in December from 2.6% in November. John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said December's fall in CPI inflation was a welcome relief for hard-pressed households and businesses. \"With the economy now growing, our members will be pleased that pressures on the cost of doing business are easing, though some concerns over rising fuel and in particular energy costs remain,\" he said. Consumer price inflation averaged 2.6% in 2013, the lowest since 2009 and down from 2.8% in 2012. The December inflation data confirmed the trend of easing food price inflation \u2013 driven by lower prices for food and meat \u2013 highlighted last week by the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said food price inflation slipped to a three-year low in December, while overall shop prices fell for the eighth month running in December. With deep discounting as shops battled for hard-pressed customers the drop in prices of 0.8% on a year earlier was the deepest deflation since the BRC's data began in December 2006. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, said the challenge was to keep inflation on target. \"Stronger growth here in the UK could push up wage costs and a rebound in the global economy is likely to push up energy, food and commodity prices once again. So we cannot be sure that this return to the inflation target will be sustained through 2014,\" said Sentance, also a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee.",

To overcome political resistance to a deal, BSkyB could remain listed but have its operating assets injected into Sky Europe in return for a majority stake in the larger entity. <br> Alternatively, the move to quad-play across Europe could also see BSkyB merge with either Vodafone UK or O2 UK. Such a deal could generate significant cost and revenue synergies that could be worth 248-264p per share. Alternatively, Sky Europe could merge with either Vodafone or Telefonica to produce a European quad-play operator. </blockquote> <p>UBS moved its rating from neutral to buy and its price target from 880p to 1100p, saying the outlook was positive:</p> <blockquote> We think trading at Sky (BSkyB) will remain resilient despite competition from the new BT Sport channel. We do not think the economics for BT Sport stack up and expect Sky to agree a wholesale deal with BT on sports at some point in 2014.

      "bodyText": "Could Rupert Murdoch take another tilt at satellite broadcaster BSkyB, where his Twenty-First Century Fox business still owns a 39% stake. Or could BSkyB be a merger partner for Vodafone or O2? Those are the intriguing suggestions in a buy note on the broadcaster from UBS. Murdoch's then News Corporation - before its split into two businesses - abandoned an \u00a38bn bid for BSkyB in 2011 in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. But analyst Polo Tang at UBS - one of BSkyB's financial advisors - said the company was a strategic asset: Fox could revisit a merger of its European pay-TV assets to form Sky Europe. To overcome political resistance to a deal, BSkyB could remain listed but have its operating assets injected into Sky Europe in return for a majority stake in the larger entity. Alternatively, the move to quad-play across Europe could also see BSkyB merge with either Vodafone UK or O2 UK. Such a deal could generate significant cost and revenue synergies that could be worth 248-264p per share. Alternatively, Sky Europe could merge with either Vodafone or Telefonica to produce a European quad-play operator. UBS moved its rating from neutral to buy and its price target from 880p to 1100p, saying the outlook was positive: We think trading at Sky (BSkyB) will remain resilient despite competition from the new BT Sport channel. We do not think the economics for BT Sport stack up and expect Sky to agree a wholesale deal with BT on sports at some point in 2014. We think investors have overlooked significant growth from new initiatives such as Adsmart, NowTV, Sky Go Extra and Entertainment Extra+ that could add \u00a3212m to profits by 2018. Our 2014 earnings per share is unchanged, but 2015 earnings per share is lowered by 5% to reflect a possible broadband price war with BT in the near term.

Pyne said Weatherill\u2019s credibility had been shredded and Labor\u2019s state election strategy of blaming the federal government was now \u201ca carcass swinging in the breeze\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn fact Stefan Jacoby has said that no amount of money, no amount of money at all from the federal government, would have caused them to make a different decision,\u201d Pyne told reporters in Canberra.</p> <p>\u201cJay Weatherill stands condemned today, condemned for using the suffering of families in northern Adelaide and in Melbourne, trying to use their suffering for his own base political survival.\u201d</p> <p>But Weatherill refused to take a backward step, saying he understood why the company had to \u201cposition themselves in a particular way\u201d given they would be one of the largest importers of cars into Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThey need to maintain relationships. But let's be absolutely clear about what was happening,\u201d Weatherill told reporters on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a negotiation with the workforce about wage freezes. There was a proposition put to the federal government. It was put there absolutely clearly; the federal industry minister [Ian Macfarlane] was advancing that cause within the federal cabinet; the state Liberal premier of Victoria [Denis Napthine] was advancing the cause jointly with me to the federal Liberal government and now of course we have the raking over the coals now Holden has closed to make sure that blame is shifted.\u201d</p> <p>Weatherill said the federal government had not agreed to a proposal the company put forward at a meeting on 2 October \u201cwhich was about making sure that Holdens stayed in Australia\u201d.</p> <p>\"On 2 October a proposition was put to the federal government that they rejected which led to the closure of Holdens. It's as simple as that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/national/general_motors_wanted_extra_year_KO8dIbxoSGCbQ5BMu0krrN\">Australian Financial Review reported in December</a> that the company requested an extra $80m a year for seven years.

      "bodyText": "The Abbott government has claimed vindication of its car industry policies after a senior General Motors (GM) executive denied the decision to end Holden manufacturing in Australia was linked to a lack of federal funding. The treasurer, Joe Hockey, who faced accusations in December that he \u201cgoaded and dared\u201d Holden to exit Australia, said the comments were a repudiation of opposition claims that the company would have made a different decision if Labor had remained in power. The head of GM\u2019s international division, Stefan Jacoby, said he was the one who decided to close Holden's Australian factories and rejected suggestions he had been influenced by Hockey\u2019s parliamentary question time criticism, according to News Corp reports. \"We are business driven. We have our own agenda and we are not pushed by anybody from the Australian government to make that decision,\" he told reporters at the Detroit motor show. \"I initiated this decision, being the leader of these markets, and the decision was driven purely by business rationale.\" Jacoby said local production did not make sense in Australia, where the market was \"just too small\" and with trade barriers likely to be broken down further. \"The decision was not made on any [government] incentives or any reduction of incentives,\" he said. Hockey\u2019s spokeswoman said the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, and the South Australian Labor premier, Jay Weatherill, had been \u201ccalled out by General Motors for their foolish behaviour in asserting that Holden would not have left Australia under Labor\u201d. \u201cAs the comments from Mr Jacoby reinforce, this was a business decision that wasn\u2019t made on the basis of any government incentives,\u201d she said. The most senior South Australian member of Tony Abbott\u2019s cabinet, Christopher Pyne, demanded an apology from Weatherill, who faces a state election in March. Pyne said Weatherill\u2019s credibility had been shredded and Labor\u2019s state election strategy of blaming the federal government was now \u201ca carcass swinging in the breeze\u201d. \u201cIn fact Stefan Jacoby has said that no amount of money, no amount of money at all from the federal government, would have caused them to make a different decision,\u201d Pyne told reporters in Canberra. \u201cJay Weatherill stands condemned today, condemned for using the suffering of families in northern Adelaide and in Melbourne, trying to use their suffering for his own base political survival.\u201d But Weatherill refused to take a backward step, saying he understood why the company had to \u201cposition themselves in a particular way\u201d given they would be one of the largest importers of cars into Australia. \u201cThey need to maintain relationships. But let's be absolutely clear about what was happening,\u201d Weatherill told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThere was a negotiation with the workforce about wage freezes. There was a proposition put to the federal government. It was put there absolutely clearly; the federal industry minister [Ian Macfarlane] was advancing that cause within the federal cabinet; the state Liberal premier of Victoria [Denis Napthine] was advancing the cause jointly with me to the federal Liberal government and now of course we have the raking over the coals now Holden has closed to make sure that blame is shifted.\u201d Weatherill said the federal government had not agreed to a proposal the company put forward at a meeting on 2 October \u201cwhich was about making sure that Holdens stayed in Australia\u201d. \"On 2 October a proposition was put to the federal government that they rejected which led to the closure of Holdens. It's as simple as that,\u201d he said. The Australian Financial Review reported in December that the company requested an extra $80m a year for seven years. The 2 October meeting in Adelaide reportedly involved managing director Mike Devereux, Macfarlane, Weatherill and his manufacturing minister, Tom Kenyon. The newspaper said a summary of the meeting showed that in order to keep making cars in Adelaide from 2016 until the end of 2022, Holden wanted $80m a year in addition to the $40m it was to receive from the Automotive Transformation Fund and $275m already pledged for seven years by the federal and state governments. On 10 December, Devereux told a Productivity Commission hearing the company was yet to make a decision on its future in Australia, prompting Hockey to demand the business \u201ccome clean with the Australian people\u201d and \u201cbe honest about it\u201d. Hockey said if he was running a business committed to a future in Australia he would not be saying he had not made a decision about its future. \"Either you're here or you're not,\u201d the treasurer said. The company announced the following day that it would cease producing cars in Australia from 2017, putting 2,900 employees out of work and threatening thousands of jobs in component manufacturing businesses. It blamed \u201cthe perfect storm of negative influences the automotive industry faces in the country including the sustained strength of the Australian dollar, high cost of production, small domestic market and arguably the most competitive and fragmented auto market in the world\u201d. Shorten said in December he believed Holden was pushed by the Coalition government\u2019s declaration that there would be no more federal support and investment. \u201cWhat I will say to the workers, the small businesses, the apprentices and the families of all these people who are displaced, is that if Labor had been in government we would not have let this happen,\u201d Shorten said at the time. \u201cJoe Hockey called their bluff and now he has thousands of jobs around his neck. His failure and that of the prime minister to keep Holden will be a defining moment of this government.\u201d Shorten was unmoved by criticism of his past statements in light of Jacoby\u2019s fresh comments. The opposition leader said Abbott and Hockey were \u201ctrying to explain away their failure to stand up and fight for thousands of Holden jobs\u201d. In a statement on Tuesday, Shorten said he did not accept the notion that Australia could not compete with the rest of the world, but it required a government that did not \u201ctreat highly skilled, blue-collar workers with contempt\u201d. \u201cThis government continues to treat Australian jobs and the livelihood of workers as a game. They have spent more time trying to justify their own inaction over Holden than they ever spent trying to protect Holden jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir pathetic excuses are cold comfort to the thousands of workers and their families who have seen their jobs leave the country under this government\u2019s watch.\u201d",
