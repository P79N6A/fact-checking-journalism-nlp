      "bodyText": "With near-empty railway stations, shut factories, mass marches and occasional outbreaks of violence during a general strike on Thursday, Spaniards showed the first signs of rebellion against the reformist, austerity-preaching conservative government they voted in four months ago. Police and pickets clashed in a handful of places, but it was a largely peaceful general strike in a country whose sinking economy, with 23% unemployment, has become the focus of worry about the future of the whole eurozone area. Thousands of police officers remained on duty around the country on Thursday night as tens of thousands of flag-waving demonstrators flooded into city centres for protest marches against labour reform and austerity measures introduced by prime minister Mariano Rajoy's conservative People's party [PP]. Demonstrators brought the centres of Madrid, Barcelona and other cities to a standstill as trade unions claimed the strike was more widely supported than previous nationwide stoppages in 2010 and 2002. Rajoy's officials claimed, however, that the 2010 strike against a socialist government had received greater support. Electricity consumption fell by 17%, suggesting the strike was impacting on major industries \u2013 though most shops appeared to be open in Madrid. Street fires were set in both Madrid and Barcelona, where roads into the city were blocked, but there were few reports of serious violence. The strike was most successful where Spain's big two unions, the General Workers Union and the Workers Commissions, are strongest \u2013 in large factories, the civil service and transport. General Workers leader C\u00e1ndido M\u00e9ndez put average participation at midday at 77% but said that it was 97%in industry and construction. \"This strike has been an unquestionable success,\" he said. Civilized protest looked unlikely to alter the determination of the government to drive on with reforms and austerity. Rajoy has pledged not to backtrack on reform that has made it easier for employers to sack workers. And the austerity measures which strikers also demonstrated against looked set to become far more dramatic on Friday, when Rajoy is set to deliver one of the harshest budgets ever seen in Europe. The general strike came on Rajoy's 100th day in power and at the end of a week that marks a watershed in political support for his party. At the weekend he had seen support slip away in Spain's largest region, southern Andalucia, where the PP's share of the vote fell in a regional election from 46% to 41%. The party also did badly in the northern region of Asturias, where it finished in third place in a Sunday vote. Regional governments, which provide most welfare services and jointly failed to reduce their deficits at all last year, are seen as one of Spain's main problems. The strike came amid growing concern about Spain in Brussels and the financial markets, which have put pressure on bond yields in recent weeks \u2013 though the Spanish government has had no trouble borrowing money to finance itself. Yields remain below the levels at which bailed-out eurozone countries like Greece, Ireland and neighbouring Portugal were forced to seek help. Spain's national debt remains lower than in most eurozone countries. Portugal's central bank cut its economic outlook on Thursday, warning the economy would be flat next year, where it had previously forecast a mild rebound of 0.3%. This year it expects a contraction of 3.4%. With an economy that is twice the size of Greece, Portugal and Ireland put together, however, problems in Spain would have far-reaching consequences. Rajoy held the budget back until Friday in order to avoid alienating voters in Andalucia, a strategy that has annoyed some commentators who believe he has wasted valuable time. The European Union has set Spain a target of cutting its deficit from 8.5% of GDP to 5.3% this year, a net cut of some \u20ac34bn (\u00a328.3bn). As Spain falls back into a double-dip recession, however, economists say austerity measures will sharpen the fall. The government already predicts a 1.7% fall in GDP this year, with unemployment rising to 24%. And with Spain entering a spiral of falling tax income, higher unemployment and recession, the real size of the cuts or tax hikes needed to meet the deficit target are much higher. Economists have put the total adjustment needed to meet this year's target at between \u20ac52bn and \u20ac64bn \u2013 or well over \u20ac1,000 per Spaniard. The government has already covered \u20ac15bn of that with emergency measures announced in December. Government sources said they were aware that Spain's credibility with the markets was on the line if it failed to meet the target, though some economists consider this impossible. But Juan Jos\u00e9 Toribio, of Spain's IESE business school, said the country could no longer afford the welfare state built up during boom years and fuelled by a giant housing bubble that has since burst. \"We cannot sustain the current model of the welfare state,\" he said. \"I am not saying we cannot have welfare, but we must seek a less expensive model.\" Kathleen Brooks, research director at Forex.com, warned that the sight of protesters on the streets of several Spanish cities will prompts fears that the government might relax its fiscal plans, making sovereign debt a less attractive purchase.",

In a 60-page review the Treasury was found to have failed to foresee the financial crisis and been too slow to recruit enough people. It now needs to slow down its high staff turnover if it is to handle any future crisis effectively. The Treasury's account \u2013 the result of the public accounts committee calling for a \"lessons learnt\" report \u2013 portrays tensions at the top of the tripartite system of regulation, which divides responsibility between the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority. This system is being ripped up by the coalition, which is handing more power to the Bank of England. The publication of the Treasury's review sparked Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, to call on the Bank of England to do the same. \"The Treasury's decision to publish its internal review reinforces the need for the Bank of England to undertake this work at the soonest appropriate time,\" said Tyrie. \"The fact it has not yet been done is a reflection of the defects in the Bank's corporate governance which must now be remedied by the legislation currently before the House,\" he said. While the Bank of England has not published such a single, formal assessment of the crisis, it put a section on its website on 6 February outlining a number of responses to the financial crisis. Andy Love, a Labour MP on the Treasury committee, said: \"We are very keen that the Bank should carry out a comprehensive review of all its activities, in order to clear the air, to make it clear that they are open and transparent, to show that they have learned from the experience and to give confidence that they will be able to deal with any future problems.\" Love said the FSA had gone through a painful review process and the Treasury had now \"come clean\" about its handling of the crisis. \"It remains for the Bank of England to ensure that parliament and the public are convinced that they have gone through a similar exercise.\" The Treasury's report set out the need for \"strong incentives\" for staff to stay for longer in the department, which has the highest turnover in Whitehall.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Co-operative Group's attempts to take control of 632 Lloyds Banking Group branches faces \"some very material regulatory issues\", the head of the mutual has warned, admitting there was no certainty a deal could be clinched. As the group announced profits had fallen 5.8% across its operations, which unite banking, grocery, pharmacies and funeral care, Peter Marks, Co-op chief executive, said the results should be \"set against the toughest economic backdrop I have seen in more than 40 years in business\". The banking arm \u2013 where profits were flat at \u00a3201m \u2013 has been granted \"preferred bidder status\" for the Lloyds branches and was supposed to have reached \"heads of agreement\" with Lloyds by Friday under the original timetable. But, Lloyds admitted last week that an agreement was still to be reached and the bailed-out bank delayed an announcement until the second quarter of the year, during which time it would work on a potential stock market flotation of the branches. Marks said that a decision on whether to proceed would be taken in \"weeks rather than months\" and admitted: \"I can't predict whether we'll get to the end on this.\" He declined to detail precisely what the regulatory issues were, but took issue with any suggestion of \"governance\" concerns at the group level, where board members are \"ordinary\" individuals, including a plasterer, a nurse and a Methodist minister. The banking arm is being run by acting chief executive Barry Tootell, and Marks said there was a permanent appointee \"waiting in the wings\" who could be named if the bid were to proceed although Marks refused to identify the individual. Marks stressed that the bank was conducting proper due diligence before making a binding offer and wanted to avoid a repeat of the humiliation suffered by Royal Bank of Scotland, which needed a taxpayer bailout after buying ABN Amro. \"What is not in question is our ability to run a bank,\" said Marks. If Co-op can submit an offer it would transform its existing 345-branch network and give it a 7% share of the current account market. This would make the enlarged Co-op a major competitor to the \"big four\" banks \u2013 Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays. Lloyds has to sell the branches by November 2013 to meet EU state aid rules and is still treating Co-op as a preferred bidder and is in \"exclusive\" discussions with the mutual. Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, said that Lloyds might need to embark on a stock market flotation of the branches instead. \"We think it is increasingly possible that this deal could fall through and that Lloyds will need to pursue a more costly IPO,\" said Greenwood. He noted that the Co-op Bank's core tier one ratio \u2013 a key measure of its regulatory strength \u2013 remains \"relatively weak\" compared to other mutuals, at 9.6%. Greenwood said other large mutuals had comparable ratios of 12% to 14%. A fall in profits across the Co-op group forced a cut in the dividend to members to 1.75p per point from 2p a year ago. Profits before tax and payments to members were down 5.8% to \u00a3373m while operating profits were flat at \u00a3585m. The food business, which has expanded rapidly since the acquisition of Somerfield, was knocked by an \"increasingly tough market\" \u2013 reporting a fall in operating profit to \u00a3309m, down \u00a3389m. Like-for-like sales in the food arm were down 2.1%, but an improvement on the 3.6% fall in the first half of the year. Marks cited \"aggressive\" promotional offers for the decline in sales during a year of \"severe challenge for the UK economy\". \"Consumers have been assailed by rising costs, the credit squeeze and uncertainty about the future to an extent unparalleled in recent times,\" Marks said. He stressed that the group would continue on its three-year \u00a32bn investment programme, despite the economic backdrop. \"Our ownership model means that we can take a long-term view and we are as driven, determined and ambitious as ever to modernise our business. We will not allow the current economic downturn to knock us off the course we have set,\" said Marks. \"Looking ahead, I do not expect to see any significant recovery in the UK economy during 2012, with little hope of an improvement in disposable income for our customers. If anything, it is quite possible that things will get worse before they get better,\" said Marks. The specialist businesses \u2013 which include funeral care and pharmacies \u2013 enjoyed the largest rise in profits, to \u00a399m from \u00a390m.",

But, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/22/lloyds-deal-bank-branches-co-op-delayed\" title=\"\">Lloyds admitted last week</a> that an agreement was still to be reached and the bailed-out bank delayed an announcement until the second quarter of the year, during which time it would work on a potential stock market flotation of the branches.</p> <p>Marks said that a decision on whether to proceed would be taken in \"weeks rather than months\" and admitted: \"I can't predict whether we'll get to the end on this.\"</p> <p>He declined to detail precisely what the regulatory issues were, but took issue with any suggestion of \"governance\" concerns at the group level, where board members are \"ordinary\" individuals, including a plasterer, a nurse and a Methodist minister.</p> <p>The banking arm is being run by acting chief executive Barry Tootell, and Marks said there was a permanent appointee \"waiting in the wings\" who could be named if the bid were to proceed although Marks refused to identify the individual.</p> <p>Marks stressed that the bank was conducting proper due diligence before making a binding offer and wanted to avoid a repeat of the humiliation suffered by Royal Bank of Scotland, which needed a taxpayer bailout after buying ABN Amro.</p> <p>\"What is not in question is our ability to run a bank,\" said Marks.</p> <p>If Co-op can submit an offer it would transform its existing 345-branch network and give it a 7% share of the current account market. This would make the enlarged Co-op a major competitor to the \"big four\" banks \u2013 Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays. Lloyds has to sell the branches by November 2013 to meet EU state aid rules and is still treating Co-op as a preferred bidder and is in \"exclusive\" discussions with the mutual.</p> <p>Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, said that Lloyds might need to embark on a stock market flotation of the branches instead. \"We think it is increasingly possible that this deal could fall through and that Lloyds will need to pursue a more costly IPO,\" said Greenwood.</p> <p>He noted that the Co-op Bank's core tier one ratio \u2013 a key measure of its regulatory strength \u2013 remains \"relatively weak\" compared to other mutuals, at 9.6%. Greenwood said other large mutuals had comparable ratios of 12% to 14%.</p> <p>A fall in profits across the Co-op group forced a cut in the dividend to members to 1.75p per point from 2p a year ago. Profits before tax and payments to members were down 5.8% to \u00a3373m while operating profits were flat at \u00a3585m.</p> <p>The food business, which has expanded rapidly since the acquisition of Somerfield, was knocked by an \"increasingly tough market\" \u2013 reporting a fall in operating profit to \u00a3309m, down \u00a3389m.</p> <p>Like-for-like sales in the food arm were down 2.1%, but an improvement on the 3.6% fall in the first half of the year.</p> <p>Marks cited \"aggressive\" promotional offers for the decline in sales during a year of \"severe challenge for the UK economy\".</p> <p>\"Consumers have been assailed by rising costs, the credit squeeze and uncertainty about the future to an extent unparalleled in recent times,\" Marks said.</p> <p>He stressed that the group would continue on its three-year \u00a32bn investment programme, despite the economic backdrop.</p> <p>\"Our ownership model means that we can take a long-term view and we are as driven, determined and ambitious as ever to modernise our business. We will not allow the current economic downturn to knock us off the course we have set,\" said Marks.</p> <p>\"Looking ahead, I do not expect to see any significant recovery in the UK economy during 2012, with little hope of an improvement in disposable income for our customers. If anything, it is quite possible that things will get worse before they get better,\" said Marks.</p> <p>The specialist businesses \u2013 which include funeral care and pharmacies \u2013 enjoyed the largest rise in profits, to \u00a399m from \u00a390m.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK is heading back into recession and will be among the slowest of the world's largest economies to recover in the first half of this year, according to a study by the Paris-based thinktank, the OECD. Only Italy will struggle over a longer period to return to growth, highlighting the difficult situation confronting the British government as it battles to boost confidence and get the economy back on track. In recent weeks surveys have shown the business and consumer sentiment falling back after an initial boost earlier this year. The Office for National Statistics added to the gloomy prognosis for the economy on Wednesday when it reported a bigger fall in output in the final three months of 2011 than first estimated. It said a previous 0.2% drop in output had underestimated the size of the fall, which further analysis found to be 0.3%. The OECD, which produces quarterly figures showing year-on-year growth, said that UK output declined at an annual rate of 1.2% in the final quarter of 2011 and will decline at an annual rate of 0.4% in the first three months of 2012. The OECD also warned that the eurozone remained in a fragile state and would struggle to grow for the rest of the year. Germany and France will race ahead of the UK in the first half of the year but are forecast to slow down as the year ends. Consumer and business confidence surveys of the eurozone on Thursday showed a decline that economists described as a blow to hopes of a recovery during 2012. Sentiment was mixed among individual countries in March. Confidence suffered a relapse in Germany and Spain, while it picked up slightly in France and Italy. The OECD has criticised Brussels for its failure to build a sufficient firewall of guarantees and insurances to protect against a sovereign collapse. In a report last week the OECD said the EU should commit at least \u20ac1 trillion to safeguard Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland against collapse after Brussels put forward plans that limited the rescue fund to \u20ac700bn (\u00a3580bn). One of the worst hit industries in the UK is construction, which is a traditional driver of growth after a recession but has barely recovered from the crash. Balfour Beatty, one of the UK's largest building firms, said it needs to make cuts among its 12,000 services staff. It warned that reduced public sector spending on infrastructure and maintenance coupled with low levels of commercial property development were hitting profit margins. Hundreds of construction firms and architecture practices are known to have laid off staff after a rehiring programme in 2010. Unemployment in the UK has risen for the last year, in contrast to the US, which has maintained several large scale public spending programmes to promote employment and maintain consumer and business confidence. The US economy is expected to grow at 2.9% in the first quarter and maintain that level of growth through the summer months, according to the OECD.",

      "body": "<p>As leading shares fell to their lowest level for nearly two months, <strong>International Power</strong> bucked the trend after a long awaited takeover move finally happened.</p> <p>Perennial talk of an offer for the company from its majority shareholder, France's GDF Suez, had done the rounds again recently, and it has finally come true. The company said on Thursday it had received a 390p a share cash approach from the French group to buy out the 30% or so it does not already own. At that price the company would be valued at more than \u00a319.5bn.</p> <p>The independent directors said the proposal was subject to certain preconditions and there was no certainty a bid would be made. They also said their announcement had been made without the consent of GDF. There is a standstill agreement in place preventing a GDF takeover until August, without the agreement of the International Power independent directors. Later GDF said taking over the company would allow it to grow more quickly by increasing its presence in emerging markets and giving it access to more capital.</p> <p>In the market International Power's shares surged 21.6p to 405p -the near 6% increase making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 - as the City bet GDF would have to offer more to win over the directors. Previously there had been speculation at least 410p a share would be needed to win the day. Analyst Angelos Anastasiou at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Given that GDF already owns 70%, we believe that it is really just a matter of: what price and when? An early guess would be at a level closer to our existing price target of 417p (or fractionally higher), that is, about 10% above the indicative 390p. </blockquote> <p>Lawson Steele at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> We believe GDF Suez will have to raise their bid, but not by much. On the one hand, waiting till August would likely only fuel the share price higher. On the other hand, they are the only bidder in town, already owning 70% of the company. <br> </blockquote> <p>He also looked at where investors who might cash in on the bid would reallocate their funds:</p> <blockquote> Should the bid materialise, we believe the funds released by the bid will find themselves into three pots. Some investors will likely want to retain a UK utility exposure which means either Centrica (a gas play), Drax (a coal spread play), or regulated plays (SSE, National Grid or UK waters). Others may want to continue the GDF Suez theme, playing Suez Environment. And, finally, some proceeds will likely ebb into other sectors. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> fell 66.96 points to 5742.03, its lowest level since 31 January, with European and US markets also under pressure. Worries about the eurozone ahead of Friday's meeting of EU ministers combined with disappointing US weekly jobless claims to unsettle investors once more. Spain's general strike and a gloomy report from the Paris-based think tank the OECD - which among other things said the UK was heading back into recession - did not help matters. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote> Today's assessment of the outlook for the Euro area big three economies [by the OECD] didn't offer much comfort with the organisation stating that it expected a technical recession in Germany, France and Italy. The OECD also announced that it expected first quarter growth in the UK to be negative to the tune of 0.4%, also signalling a technical recession in the UK as well. <br> This assessment does appear to be at odds with recent data, especially in the UK and Germany, however with economic data remaining weaker and Eurozone leaders not really addressing the issue of an increased bailout fund, markets continue to slip lower. </blockquote> <p>To add to all that, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's said Greece may well have to restructure its debt again at some point.</p> <p>Banks were among the biggest fallers on the renewed eurozone worries. <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> was also hit by concerns its deal to sell more than 600 branches to the Co-op might fall through, losing 1.01p to 33.425p. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> We have expressed scepticism that this deal can be completed for a number of reasons (funding, integration, management). In the Co-op's results statement we note comments from the Co-op Group chief executive, Peter Marks, that the deal is \"complex and that there can be no certainty it will reach a final agreement\". We think it is increasingly possible that this deal could fall through and that Lloyds will need to pursue a more costly IPO. </blockquote> <p>Among the risers <strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong> added 37p to \u00a325.57 after it said half year sales had climbed 3%, with improving performances in Spain, Ukraine and the US.</p> <p>Online gaming group <strong>Bwin.party Digital</strong> also benefited from a good reception to its figures, up 10.2p at 156.4p.</p> <p>But <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> slipped 11p to 373.2p and <strong>Next</strong> lost 29p to \u00a329.80 after Swedish rival Hennes &amp; Mauritz said rising cotton prices had hit its profit margins.</p> <p><strong>Firstgroup</strong> fell 41.7p to 247.4p following a trading update which said bus revenue growth and cost efficiencies would not be enough to offset the impact of reduced government subsidies and rising fuel costs. Rival transport companies also came under pressure, with <strong>Go-Ahead</strong> down 71p at \u00a312.30 and <strong>National Express </strong>12.8p lower at 239.2p.</p> <p>Meanwhile the bid battle for <strong>Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide</strong>, down 0.44p to 33.56p, is set to drag on. Potential predators <strong>Vodafone</strong>, up 0.75p at 174.45p, and Tata Communications of India had been given a deadline of 5pm on Thursday to either bid or go away, but this has now been extended until 19 April. CWW said the move was at its request \"to enable each of Vodafone and Tata to establish whether or not their preliminary discussions with CWW might result in a formal offer for the company which the board would be willing to recommend.\"</p> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Mouchel</strong>, the troubled infrastructure group, slumped nearly 19% to 8.75p. The company reported a half year loss of \u00a36.3m, compared to a \u00a34.1m profit, and said a significantly dilutive equity issue was once option to help restructure its debt by the end of its financial year in July.</p> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Getech</strong>, which supplies data and studies to the oil, gas and mining exploration sectors, added nearly 10% to 23.5p after half year profits rose 22% to \u00a3358,000.</p>",

The company said on Thursday it had received a 390p a share cash approach from the French group to buy out the 30% or so it does not already own. At that price the company would be valued at more than \u00a319.5bn. The independent directors said the proposal was subject to certain preconditions and there was no certainty a bid would be made. They also said their announcement had been made without the consent of GDF. There is a standstill agreement in place preventing a GDF takeover until August, without the agreement of the International Power independent directors. Later GDF said taking over the company would allow it to grow more quickly by increasing its presence in emerging markets and giving it access to more capital. In the market International Power's shares surged 21.6p to 405p -the near 6% increase making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 - as the City bet GDF would have to offer more to win over the directors. Previously there had been speculation at least 410p a share would be needed to win the day. Analyst Angelos Anastasiou at Investec said: Given that GDF already owns 70%, we believe that it is really just a matter of: what price and when? An early guess would be at a level closer to our existing price target of 417p (or fractionally higher), that is, about 10% above the indicative 390p. Lawson Steele at Espirito Santo said: We believe GDF Suez will have to raise their bid, but not by much. On the one hand, waiting till August would likely only fuel the share price higher. On the other hand, they are the only bidder in town, already owning 70% of the company. He also looked at where investors who might cash in on the bid would reallocate their funds: Should the bid materialise, we believe the funds released by the bid will find themselves into three pots. Some investors will likely want to retain a UK utility exposure which means either Centrica (a gas play), Drax (a coal spread play), or regulated plays (SSE, National Grid or UK waters). Others may want to continue the GDF Suez theme, playing Suez Environment. And, finally, some proceeds will likely ebb into other sectors. Overall the FTSE 100 fell 66.96 points to 5742.03, its lowest level since 31 January, with European and US markets also under pressure. Worries about the eurozone ahead of Friday's meeting of EU ministers combined with disappointing US weekly jobless claims to unsettle investors once more. Spain's general strike and a gloomy report from the Paris-based think tank the OECD - which among other things said the UK was heading back into recession - did not help matters. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Today's assessment of the outlook for the Euro area big three economies [by the OECD] didn't offer much comfort with the organisation stating that it expected a technical recession in Germany, France and Italy. The OECD also announced that it expected first quarter growth in the UK to be negative to the tune of 0.4%, also signalling a technical recession in the UK as well. This assessment does appear to be at odds with recent data, especially in the UK and Germany, however with economic data remaining weaker and Eurozone leaders not really addressing the issue of an increased bailout fund, markets continue to slip lower. To add to all that, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's said Greece may well have to restructure its debt again at some point. Banks were among the biggest fallers on the renewed eurozone worries. Lloyds Banking Group was also hit by concerns its deal to sell more than 600 branches to the Co-op might fall through, losing 1.01p to 33.425p. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said: We have expressed scepticism that this deal can be completed for a number of reasons (funding, integration, management). In the Co-op's results statement we note comments from the Co-op Group chief executive, Peter Marks, that the deal is \"complex and that there can be no certainty it will reach a final agreement\". We think it is increasingly possible that this deal could fall through and that Lloyds will need to pursue a more costly IPO. Among the risers Imperial Tobacco added 37p to \u00a325.57 after it said half year sales had climbed 3%, with improving performances in Spain, Ukraine and the US. Online gaming group Bwin.party Digital also benefited from a good reception to its figures, up 10.2p at 156.4p. But Marks &amp; Spencer slipped 11p to 373.2p and Next lost 29p to \u00a329.80 after Swedish rival Hennes &amp; Mauritz said rising cotton prices had hit its profit margins. Firstgroup fell 41.7p to 247.4p following a trading update which said bus revenue growth and cost efficiencies would not be enough to offset the impact of reduced government subsidies and rising fuel costs. Rival transport companies also came under pressure, with Go-Ahead down 71p at \u00a312.30 and National Express 12.8p lower at 239.2p. Meanwhile the bid battle for Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide, down 0.44p to 33.56p, is set to drag on. Potential predators Vodafone, up 0.75p at 174.45p, and Tata Communications of India had been given a deadline of 5pm on Thursday to either bid or go away, but this has now been extended until 19 April. CWW said the move was at its request \"to enable each of Vodafone and Tata to establish whether or not their preliminary discussions with CWW might result in a formal offer for the company which the board would be willing to recommend.\" Lower down the market Mouchel, the troubled infrastructure group, slumped nearly 19% to 8.75p. The company reported a half year loss of \u00a36.3m, compared to a \u00a34.1m profit, and said a significantly dilutive equity issue was once option to help restructure its debt by the end of its financial year in July. Lower down the market Getech, which supplies data and studies to the oil, gas and mining exploration sectors, added nearly 10% to 23.5p after half year profits rose 22% to \u00a3358,000.",

James Hollins, analyst at Investec, described the decision as a \"minor disappointment\" but said Rank was \"right to walk away\". \"The announcement of these talks was made on 30 January and we had projected completion of the deal at a sensible price given Gala Coral's desire to raise funds for paying down its material gross debt of \u00a32.1bn at September 2011,\" Hollins said. Private-equity owned Gala Coral also blamed the price for the breakdown in talks, sparked after an approach from Rank rather than because it had put the business up for sale. \"Our casino business was not for sale when Rank made an unsolicited approach. Now that it is clear that a transaction on terms acceptable to our shareholders cannot be concluded, we are very happy to continue to drive growth from our casinos which are performing very strongly,\" Gala Coral said. \"These discussions have now ended after the parties failed to reach an agreement that was in the best interests of our shareholders,\" Gala Coral added. Ian Burke, Rank's chairman and chief executive, said it was \"committed to delivering sustainable growth in shareholder value; the proposed terms of the potential acquisition did not achieve this objective\". \"We will now concentrate on delivering our organic growth plans, including the delivery of 12 more G casinos by 2015,\" Burke said. Rank, 74.5%-owned by Malaysia's Guoco, has 35 casinos and 103 bingo halls in Britain. Gala Coral was spun out of Bass in 1997 and has had a number of private equity owners since then. Its main shareholders are Apollo, Cerberus, Park Square and York Capital Management, which bought out Candover, Cinven and Permira in 2010. Gala Coral will now press on with the relaunch of the website and refurbishment of some casinos. One of the most senior executives at Gala Coral is Andy Hornby, the chief executive of HBOS when it was rescued by Lloyds Banking Group during the 2008 banking crisis. Hornby's role has been to revive the bookmaking arm Coral, which he joined after leaving the pharmacy business Alliance Boots, his first employer after he left HBOS.",

      "bodyText": "More than two years into a debt crisis that has raised fundamental questions about the longevity of the euro, the single currency's finance ministers are to decide on Friday how much money they are prepared to put up to secure it. Meeting in Copenhagen, the eurozone ministers look likely to clash over the scale of a permanent bailout fund coming into operation in July, although German insistence that it should not exceed \u20ac700bn (\u00a3580bn) looks likely to hold sway. A draft statement leaked on Thursday said the bailout fund would be capped at \u20ac700bn and fall back to \u20ac500bn when current lending programmes expire, but that a further \u20ac240bn would be held in reserve to ensure the fund's lending capacity. At issue is whether a bigger euro firewall will deter the bond markets from attacking the eurozone's weak points \u2013 Spain and Italy \u2013 by pushing the costs of their borrowing to unsustainable levels, or whether it will simply encourage profligacy. The Germans take the latter view. The Americans, the French, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development argue the bigger the firewall, the greater the deterrent and therefore the less likelihood that the fund will need to be used. \"The bigger the firewall, the less risk weaker countries will be attacked by the markets,\" said Fran\u00e7ois Baroin, the French finance minister. He said the fund should extend to \u20ac1tn, a figure also used this week by Angel Gurr\u00eda, head of the OECD, calling on Europe to create \"the mother of all firewalls\". That demand was dismissed on Thursday by Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who is tipped to take over the chair of the eurogroup from Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg, although that decision may be postponed on Friday. \"You can make a firewall as high as you want and it will be no help,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. The permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, is capped at \u20ac500bn and comes into operation in July. Germany has already shifted to a ceiling of \u20ac700bn from the initial \u20ac500bn and is unlikely to countenance any more. The European commission says this is not enough to placate the bond markets and encourage the IMF to drum up a further \u20ac500bn in crisis-fighting reserves. Almost two years ago the eurozone established a temporary instrument with \u20ac440bn \u2013 \u20ac200bn of which is being used to prop up Greece, Portugal and Ireland. This fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, expires next year. The German proposal is to allow the \u20ac200bn in loans from the EFSF to run their course concurrently with the new fund, meaning the total lending can be \u20ac700bn until the current programmes expire. The spare \u20ac240bn from the temporary fund, meanwhile, can be held in reserve to ensure the new fund can lend to capacity, as it will take two years for paid-in capital to be completed, limiting the lending potential until then. The ministers will discuss what to do about Spain's fiscal quagmire as Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister who has become embattled within a few months of taking office, announces savage new spending cuts on Friday, and they will engage in ferocious horse-trading for jobs at the European Central Bank, the European Bank in London, the head of the new ESM bailout fund, and the chair of the eurogroup. On Saturday, when the 10 other EU finance ministers join the 17 eurozone ministers, the meeting will also debate whether and how to opt for a financial transactions or \"Robin Hood\" tax (FTT) on the financial markets, which Britain opposes. France and Germany are in favour but cannot muster even a eurozone consensus. Sch\u00e4uble and Juncker said this week the FTT will not fly. It would not only split the EU, but also divide the eurozone. A European commission proposal for the tax says it would raise \u20ac57bn a year. Instead ministers could opt to draft a levy on the stock markets which would raise only a fraction of that sum.",

      "bodyText": "Back in the 1970s, North Sea oil and gas were the great hope for the British economy. The UK had struggled to keep up with its European rivals in the three decades after the second world war, but the discoveries on the continental shelf were supposed to bring about a new Klondike gold rush. Britain would be self-sufficient in energy and the revenues from the North Sea would modernise the economy. Getting on for four decades later, North Sea resources are running dry. Figures released by the Department for Energy and Climate Change on Thursday showed that oil production in 2011 was more than 17% lower than in the previous year. A total of 1.04m barrels a day was pumped, down from a peak of 2.7m in 1999, and the lowest since the 1970s. Gas imports were higher than production for the first time since 1967, the year the Beatles released Sgt Pepper. George Osborne included a measure in his budget last week designed to end the uncertainty over the tax treatment of decommissioning rigs, hoping that the UK can extract every last drop of oil from the North Sea fields. This was welcomed by the industry, but doesn't change the grim truth: output is in terminal decline. And what has Britain got to show for this bonanza? Not much. Norway has used its North Sea revenues to amass a sovereign wealth fund that will help the country adjust to an ageing population. Britain used its oil and gas receipts to pay for mass unemployment, tax cuts and current government spending. Boasts that the black gold would retool British industry proved utterly hollow. If anything, oil added to the woes of manufacturing, since sterling's status as a petro-currency drove up the exchange rate and made exports uncompetitive. A fraction of the billions creamed off by the Treasury might have been used as the capital for a national investment bank, but neither Conservative nor Labour governments saw fit to use the receipts for this purpose. Lower North Sea oil production is one reason for Britain's weak economic recovery and makes it harder for Osborne to balance the books. Even more worryingly, acute energy dependency looms. The coal mines have closed; the older nuclear power stations are on their last legs; the gush from the North Sea will soon be a mere dribble. An entire era can be summed up in three words: discovered, extracted, squandered.",

That is about to change as Laura Ashley, the company famous for its floral prints, prepares to enter the fray. The firm has bought a hotel in Hertfordshire for \u00a35.8m which it hopes will become an attraction for Laura Ashley fans, with all 49 rooms boasting beds, sofa, wallpaper and curtains in matching fabrics. Its chief operating officer, Se\u00e1n Anglim, said the hotel would become a \"brand showcase\" for its products and interior design service when it opens later this year. The hotel is currently trading under another, undisclosed, name. \"We are not disclosing how much we will spend on the refurbishment but we are going to turn it into something special,\" said Anglim, who added that over the years the 60-year-old company had been approached by hoteliers who wanted to license the brand. \"The concept of a Laura Ashley hotel has not come out of the blue.\" The hotel plans were revealed as the retailer reported profits of \u00a318.8m on sales of \u00a3285.9m in the year to 28 January. The brand's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades but is back in vogue again, with like-for-like sales up nearly 11% in the last eight weeks, defying the tough high-street conditions faced by retailers selling big ticket products like furniture. Laura Ashley shares were up 5.1% at 22.9p in London by lunchtime. The brand's roots date back to 1953 when Laura and Bernard Ashley started printing fabric on their kitchen table in London. The designer had been inspired by a Women's Institute exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum on traditional handicrafts and wanted to make her own patchwork quilts but couldn't find fabrics she liked. After swotting up on fabric printing in libraries the couple invested \u00a310 in wood for a screen, dyes and some linen, and printed their own. They owe their big break to Audrey Hepburn, who started a trend for wearing headscarves in the film Roman Holiday. The Ashleys realised they could produce the scarves themselves, and within a short space of time, were receiving large orders from shops including John Lewis and Heal's.",

      "bodyText": "Lenders expect to reduce the amount of credit they give to households in the second quarter of the year in a move that economists warn is likely to curb any economic recovery. As the Bank of England's quarterly credit conditions survey showed that lenders intended to cut credit to households in the next three months, there was also an unexpected fall in mortgage approvals. Home loan approvals fell to 48,986, their lowest in eight months, in February. This was analysts' expectations and prompted warnings from mortgage brokers that conditions resembled the \"dark days\" of the banking crisis in 2008. For small, medium and large companies, the total amount of credit available to them was unchanged in the three months to March \u2013 in contrast to the predictions of lenders, who had expected it to rise. Businesses repaid \u00a34bn more than was granted in new loans, according to the Bank of England's latest lending data, which showed a three-month annualised contraction of 7.9% for February \u2013 the weakest figure since September 2009. Commercial property lending is also expected to fall in the next three months. Lord Oakeshott, the former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, said: \"There will be no green shoots in our economic garden while banks are blocking the hosepipe.\" Lenders reported that they were expecting to reduce home loans for the first time since the second quarter of 2010 and were also pushing up the cost of these loans, despite the base rate having remained at the historically low level of 0.5% for three years. The Bank of England said lenders' forecasts for a reduction in lending \"reflected the tightening in wholesale funding conditions since mid-2011 and bank balance sheet pressures\". \"Other factors such as changing risk appetite, market share objectives and expectations of house prices were also expected to pull down on credit availability,\" the Bank said, warning that lending criteria were also being tightened. The Bank of England data coincided with the Nationwide house price index showing a 1% drop in house prices in March on the previous month. It was the biggest fall in two years, marking the end of the stamp duty holiday. The drop indicates that most first-time buyers, keen to take advantage of the stamp-duty holiday before it ended on 24 March, made offers for homes in January to make sure there was sufficient time to complete their purchase before the deadline. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said a slowdown was to be expected given the expiry of the holiday on properties costing up to \u00a3250,000. About 180,000 buyers benefited from not paying stamp duty since introduction of the exemption in March 2010, and mortgage brokers, solicitors and mortgage lenders reported a rush by buyers to complete before its withdrawal last week. Such buyers are likely to have agreed prices and started the conveyancing process in January, leading to a fall-off in prospective buyers in February and March. Gardner added: \"This dampening effect on housing market activity and prices may fade over the course of the summer, especially if the wider economic outlook begins to improve and other policy measures, such as the government's NewBuy scheme, are successful in supporting buyer demand.\" Dominic Hennessy, director of independent mortgage broker, Just Us Mortgages, said: \"As a mortgage broker, right now it feels like we've been whisked back to the dark days of 2008.\" Economists said the restricted credit to households would do little to help the economy, which Paris-based thinktank the OECD claimed was already in recession. \"The overall message from the data was that weak bank lending is likely to remain a significant constraint on the economic recovery,\" said Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.",

In the market International Power's shares have surged 20.6p to 404p as traders bet GDF would have to offer more to win over the directors. Previously there had been speculation at least 410p a share would be needed to win the day.",
