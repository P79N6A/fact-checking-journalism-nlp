    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Greek exit from the single currency threatens to plunge Britain into a second recession equal in ferocity to the record postwar slump of 2008-09, according to the expert responsible for the government's economic forecasting. Robert Chote, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, who was speaking to the Guardian as world financial markets staggered to the end of a week that rekindled memories of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, warned that there was risk that a fresh downturn would do irreparable damage to the UK. Britain has made up less than half the ground lost when output plunged by more than 7% in 2008-09, and Chote said there was a risk that \"you go down and you never quite get back up to where you started\". In a separate exclusive interview, Alexis Tsipras, the increasingly powerful 37-year-old Greek politician now regarded by many as holding the future of the euro in his hands, told the Guardian that he was determined \"to stop the experiment\" with austerity policies imposed by Germany. He described the tax increases and spending cuts as a \"crime against the Greek people\". The leader of the Syriza party, whose success in last month's general election has led to political paralysis in Athens and a second general election, said he wanted Greece to stay in the euro, but was fighting capitalism. \"On the one side there are workers and a majority of people, and on the other are global capitalists, bankers, profiteers on stock exchanges, the big funds. It's a war between peoples and capitalism ... it is the international financial system, and more especially banks, that are gaining most\". The head of the UK's OBR said the deepening crisis in the eurozone could force him to tear up his forecasts, made only two months ago, that Britain would post modest growth of 0.8% this year. \"The concern is that you end up with an outcome in the eurozone that creates the same sort of structural difficulties in the financial system and in the economy that we saw in the past recession, and that has consequences both for hitting economic activity in the economy, but also its underlying potential,\" said Chote. With economic output in the UK still 4% below its peak level when the recession began in early 2008, the prime minister and the governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, have expressed concern in recent days about the vulnerability of Britain to the eurozone. Chote said he was particularly concerned about the possibility that a second deep recession would leave permanent scars. \"That means not just that the economy weakens and then strengthens again \u2013 it goes into a hole and comes out \u2013 but that you go down and you never quite get back up to where you started.\" Shares in London closed down for a third week, with the jittery mood in financial markets pushing the FTSE 100 below 5,400 for the first time this year. German and French stock markets were also depressed, with even the much-anticipated stock market debut of Facebook in New York failing to lift spirits. Greece's caretaker prime minister, Panagiotis Pikramenos, said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had suggested in a phone call to the Greek president, Karolos Papoulias, on Friday that Greece hold a referendum on its continued membership of the single currency alongside next month's elections, in an apparent attempt to encourage voters to back mainstream parties who support the current austerity programme. The German government said that no suggestion of the kind had been made. But the Greek government was insistent, and said that Pikramenos had rejected the suggestion because he does not have the power to call a referendum. Merkel's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said the eurozone crisis could last two more years, while financial market speculation that Greece's days in the euro were numbered cast a shadow over the annual gathering of leaders of the G8 western industrial nations at Camp David. Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, voiced his frustration at Europe's leaders, demanding tough action to tackle the crisis. In Brussels, the European commission denied comments by Europe's trade minister, Karel de Gucht, that preparations were being made for Greece's departure from the single currency. Meanwhile, analysts at Deutsche Bank predicted that the weak state of Ireland's banks could result in the former Celtic tiger requiring a second bailout, and in Spain there were reports that the government would call in Goldman Sachs to help sort out its banks after 16 suffered credit downgrades on Thursday. In an echo of the months leading up to the Lehmans collapse, Mike Smith, chief executive of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, said the turmoil in the eurozone meant Australian banks were being frozen out of money markets when seeking funds. Chote said there were so many uncertainties around what might happen with Greece and the eurozone that trying to produce firm predictions was not \"particularly helpful\". But the OBR has tried to quantify the impact of a disorderly sovereign debt restructuring in the eurozone on Britain \u2013 and the figures make grim reading. Britain would be plunged into recession for two years, according to the OBR analysis, published in its most recent economic and fiscal outlook report. There would also be deflation and unemployment would reach almost 11% by 2013-14, with debt subsequently reaching more than 90% of GDP. Chote said these projections were of limited value because the eurozone crisis could develop in so many different ways. \"For example, one issue would be, do difficulties in the eurozone make it cheaper or more expensive for the UK government to borrow?\" he said. \"If it makes investors more nervous about risk in general, it might make it more expensive. If they see the UK as more of a safe haven, it might make it less expensive.\"",

Concerns about the health of Spain's banks were growing following the mass downgrade by Moody's late on Thursday.</p> <p>Steve Pateman, head of Santander UK's high-street banking operation, told the Guardian that the UK business had not paid a dividend to its parent company since the first half of 2011 and emphasised the financial strength of the UK business.</p> <p>The FSA confirmed that the restriction was in place. \"With the full co-operation of Santander UK, the FSA has in place arrangements that require the FSA to give permission to any transfer of funds out of the UK by Santander UK.\"</p> <p>Santander's shares rose on Friday despite the mass downgrades, as the Madrid stock market regained its composure after Thursday's rout, which had been prompted by a dramatic fall in the shares of bailed-out Bankia.</p> <p>The Madrid stock market gained 0.2% even after the Bank of Spain revealed that bad loans in Spain's banks, which have been hit by a bursting of the property bubble, have reached their highest levels in 18 years.</p> <p>The Spanish government is to call in Goldman Sachs to make an independent valuation of Bankia, the country's fourth-largest lender, whose shares bounced back 23.5% on Friday, compensating for the 14% drop on Thursday, following reports \u2013 which were denied \u2013 of withdrawals from the bank.</p> <p>The admission by Spain's central bank that bad loans had reached their highest in 18 years in March put further pressure on a country that is already at the centre of concerns about the long-term viability of the eurozone. With 8.37% of outstanding loans now deemed bad, the government was under pressure to hasten the work of independent auditors who are to review the value of Spanish bank assets.</p> <p>The independent auditors will be named on Monday and asked to deliver the results of rapid stress tests within a month.

The so-called \"regulatory order\" means that Santander UK needs the regulator's permission to transfer cash, underlining Santander UK's claim that its assets are ringfenced from its parent company. Concerns about the health of Spain's banks were growing following the mass downgrade by Moody's late on Thursday. Steve Pateman, head of Santander UK's high-street banking operation, told the Guardian that the UK business had not paid a dividend to its parent company since the first half of 2011 and emphasised the financial strength of the UK business. The FSA confirmed that the restriction was in place. \"With the full co-operation of Santander UK, the FSA has in place arrangements that require the FSA to give permission to any transfer of funds out of the UK by Santander UK.\" Santander's shares rose on Friday despite the mass downgrades, as the Madrid stock market regained its composure after Thursday's rout, which had been prompted by a dramatic fall in the shares of bailed-out Bankia. The Madrid stock market gained 0.2% even after the Bank of Spain revealed that bad loans in Spain's banks, which have been hit by a bursting of the property bubble, have reached their highest levels in 18 years. The Spanish government is to call in Goldman Sachs to make an independent valuation of Bankia, the country's fourth-largest lender, whose shares bounced back 23.5% on Friday, compensating for the 14% drop on Thursday, following reports \u2013 which were denied \u2013 of withdrawals from the bank. The admission by Spain's central bank that bad loans had reached their highest in 18 years in March put further pressure on a country that is already at the centre of concerns about the long-term viability of the eurozone. With 8.37% of outstanding loans now deemed bad, the government was under pressure to hasten the work of independent auditors who are to review the value of Spanish bank assets. The independent auditors will be named on Monday and asked to deliver the results of rapid stress tests within a month. A fuller study will be published in two or three months. The moves come as Spain tries to persuade markets that its banks are not hiding toxic real estate assets left over from the 2008 housing bust. \"We think the stress tests will clarify everything,\" a senior government source said. \"We will be totally transparent about what these valuers do.\" While shares in Spanish banks were firmer, UK banks were hit hard amid the continued anxiety about the eurozone's future. Bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, losing 6% and 5% respectively on a day when the FTSE 100 index lost 1.3% of its value. Spain partly nationalised Bankia last week because of the weight of junk real estate assets on its books. Senior government sources said Bankia would next week present a plan to clean up its balance sheet, with many observers expecting it to sell off its shares in major companies such as insurance provider Mapfre. The Expansi\u00f3n newspaper reported that Bankia's financial hole may reach \u20ac8bn (\u00a36.4bn) on top of the \u20ac10bn that it must set aside to cover potential real estate losses. The government has said it wants help from Europe to see out the coming storm \u2013 probably in the form of bond purchases by the European Central Bank - though it is against direct intervention.",

There are 177 Locals with 28 run by One Stop. Other convenience chains involved include the Co-op, Spar and Martin McColl.</p> <p>Vennells is understood to have been referring to a conversation at a round-table event hosted by Lamb to discuss the Post Office's \"network strategy\".</p> <p>To become a Local a subpostmaster must give up an annual fixed payment from the Post Office and instead work on a commission basis. To encourage them to take the leap the Post Office is offering a payment of up to \u00a310,000 for store refurbishments. On that basis One Stop, which was acquired by Tesco in 2002 as part of its \u00a3377m acquisition of T&amp;S Stores, would have been entitled to up to \u00a3280,000 to revamp its 28 stores.</p> <p>Vennells told the committee that retailers liked the new Local model because it increased staff productivity \u2013 specialist staff are no longer required to stay behind the separate counter and can serve shoppers \u2013 and boosted sales by an average of 9%. Industry sources suggested other retailers were less enthusiastic about adopting the Local model but would feel pressured to do so if the alternative was the business being handed to One Stop.</p> <p>The Post Office was previously part of Royal Mail Group but became independent last month when the government created separate companies. Ministers are priming the Royal Mail for sale \u2013 either through a stock market flotation, or a private sale \u2013 but hope the Post Office will eventually be mutualised. The most recent annual report shows the Post Office making an operating profit of \u00a321m on sales of \u00a3776m. It receives an annual government subsidy of \u00a3150m.</p> <p>George Thomson, from the <a href=\"http://www.nfsp.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Federation of SubPostmasters</a>, said it would oppose any Post Office tie-up with Tesco: \"I'd warn the Post Office they have to be very careful that they don't get in bed with Tesco because Tesco are seen as actually damaging local retail and damaging local high streets.\"</p> <p>Vennells told the committee the Post Office network was already a \"mixed economy\" with independent and multiple retailers working side by side. WH Smith, for example, has 70 franchises. A Post Office spokesman said: \"We have no plans to roll out additional post office branches into One Stop shops.\" One Stop also denied that a rollout to all of its 613 shops was on the cards: \"Customers like the convenience of post office services in One Stop shops, but we do not have plans or aspirations to roll out services across all our stores,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>Earlier this year the government earmarked \u00a31.3bn to begin modernising the Post Office network. The money is being targeted at half its 11,800 branches with Post Office bosses aiming for 2,000 \"locals\" and 4,000 so-called \"main\" post offices. Those running these larger outlets are entitled to grants of up to \u00a345,000 for refurbishments but must also give up the fixed pay element of their income. The changes are designed to reduce the Post Office's \u00a3450m annual bill for sub-postmaster remuneration.</p> <p>The Local model has come under fire from watchdog Consumer Focus which, in a recent report, found several problems with the new services, including basic errors such as second-class postage being sold correctly only one in five times. Large or heavy parcels were refused in a quarter of cases and special delivery was mis-sold in a third of cases.</p>",

She told MPs: \"I was in a meeting last week with the minister, so this was said in front of the postal affairs minister [Norman Lamb], where one of the operators who is running 25 of these new locals asked if they could have one in every one of the 600 stores they have.\" Industry experts said the executive was referring to One Stop as it is the only multiple operating more than 20 Locals at present. There are 177 Locals with 28 run by One Stop. Other convenience chains involved include the Co-op, Spar and Martin McColl. Vennells is understood to have been referring to a conversation at a round-table event hosted by Lamb to discuss the Post Office's \"network strategy\". To become a Local a subpostmaster must give up an annual fixed payment from the Post Office and instead work on a commission basis. To encourage them to take the leap the Post Office is offering a payment of up to \u00a310,000 for store refurbishments. On that basis One Stop, which was acquired by Tesco in 2002 as part of its \u00a3377m acquisition of T&amp;S Stores, would have been entitled to up to \u00a3280,000 to revamp its 28 stores. Vennells told the committee that retailers liked the new Local model because it increased staff productivity \u2013 specialist staff are no longer required to stay behind the separate counter and can serve shoppers \u2013 and boosted sales by an average of 9%. Industry sources suggested other retailers were less enthusiastic about adopting the Local model but would feel pressured to do so if the alternative was the business being handed to One Stop. The Post Office was previously part of Royal Mail Group but became independent last month when the government created separate companies. Ministers are priming the Royal Mail for sale \u2013 either through a stock market flotation, or a private sale \u2013 but hope the Post Office will eventually be mutualised. The most recent annual report shows the Post Office making an operating profit of \u00a321m on sales of \u00a3776m. It receives an annual government subsidy of \u00a3150m. George Thomson, from the National Federation of SubPostmasters, said it would oppose any Post Office tie-up with Tesco: \"I'd warn the Post Office they have to be very careful that they don't get in bed with Tesco because Tesco are seen as actually damaging local retail and damaging local high streets.\" Vennells told the committee the Post Office network was already a \"mixed economy\" with independent and multiple retailers working side by side. WH Smith, for example, has 70 franchises. A Post Office spokesman said: \"We have no plans to roll out additional post office branches into One Stop shops.\" One Stop also denied that a rollout to all of its 613 shops was on the cards: \"Customers like the convenience of post office services in One Stop shops, but we do not have plans or aspirations to roll out services across all our stores,\" said a spokesman. Earlier this year the government earmarked \u00a31.3bn to begin modernising the Post Office network. The money is being targeted at half its 11,800 branches with Post Office bosses aiming for 2,000 \"locals\" and 4,000 so-called \"main\" post offices. Those running these larger outlets are entitled to grants of up to \u00a345,000 for refurbishments but must also give up the fixed pay element of their income. The changes are designed to reduce the Post Office's \u00a3450m annual bill for sub-postmaster remuneration. The Local model has come under fire from watchdog Consumer Focus which, in a recent report, found several problems with the new services, including basic errors such as second-class postage being sold correctly only one in five times. Large or heavy parcels were refused in a quarter of cases and special delivery was mis-sold in a third of cases.",

      "bodyText": "Adam Posen, the Bank of England arch-dove, is to step down from the Bank's interest rate setting committee at the end of the summer, undermining hopes of further monetary easing to bolster the ailing UK economy. Posen has refused to apply for a second term on the monetary policy committee after accepting a job as boss of the US economic thinktank, the Peterson Institute. For a long time he was a lone voice on the committee arguing for a boost to the \u00a3200bn intervention made in the immediate aftermath of the Lehman's collapse in 2008. The prospect of further quantitative easing this year appeared to be strong after the UK fell into a second recession in three years and indicators showed business confidence and household finances on the decline. Posen, a US academic, voted against an increase in the \u00a3325bn in bond purchases by the Bank of England at the MPC's last meeting after he and his eight colleagues were spooked by a rise in inflation during March and some business surveys that showed a more upbeat picture than official data. But he has since indicated that he would renew his call to print more electronic money after a series of troubling forecasts. The Treasury, which appoints external members to the committee, said it would advertise shortly for a role that is open to all senior economists. The MPC's last appointment was Goldman Sachs economist Ben Broadbent, who arrived last summer. The Treasury was criticised at the time for failing to find a woman candidate. The committee, which was founded in 1997 by former chancellor Gordon Brown as an independent bulwark against the interest rate setting whims of the Treasury, always had at least one woman until the departure of Kate Barker in 2010. Sir Mervyn King, the bank's governor, said Posen had made an \"outstanding contribution\" during his three years on the MPC and wished him well in his new role. But during most of that time the two men have been at loggerheads over how to adjust monetary policy at a time of government cuts, tax rises and an unstable situation in the eurozone. Posen made it clear in a series of speeches \u2013 backed up by his voting record on the MPC \u2013 that it should move more quickly to support the economy. While he never accused King by name, he believed the governor and his supporters underestimated the slow pace of recovery and the negative effect of the government's policies on investment and spending. It was the third time the governor was accused of being slow to react to events, after he waited until the last moment to rescue Northern Rock, triggering the first bank run in more than 100 years. King was also accused by former MPC member David Blanchflower of being slow to cut interest rates in 2008 when the Lehman's crisis was looming. Jonathan Portes, head of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said Posen would be much missed. \"He has been a sane and sensible voice on the MPC and his interpretation of the economy has proved to be justified.\" Posen said: \"I am proud of the work we have done trying to understand and stabilise UK economic performance in the aftermath of the global crisis. I also am sincerely grateful to the many people from all areas of the United Kingdom who engaged with me openly and frankly during my travels for the MPC.\"",

      "standfirst": "The chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility talks about the potential impact of the eurozone crisis on Britain, the reliability of economic forecasts, and the future role of the OBR", 
      "body": "<p>How bad is it going to get? As chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote is the government's independent forecaster-in-chief and the man responsible for checking that George Osborne's budget figures add up. In a wide-ranging interview, Chote discussed the eurozone crisis and much else. Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Chote said Greece leaving the euro could plunge Britain into a recession as bad as the last one, causing long-term damage to the economy.</strong> He stressed the difficulties of forecasting the economic consequences of a Greek exit, but acknowledged there was a danger \"not just that the economy weakens and then strengthens again \u2013 ie, it goes into a hole and comes out \u2013 but that you go down and you never quite get back up to where you started\".</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said there was no evidence to show that cutting the 50p top rate of tax would promote growth.</strong> \"We didn't feel that there was a strong enough evidence base to say our long-term or medium-term view of the economy is now more optimistic than it was beforehand as a result of that measure,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said current spending on public sector pensions was sustainable in the long-term. </strong>The public finances as a whole would come under pressure in years to come, but the current pension regime was \"not where the problem is coming from\", he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that the OBR was better at producing reliable forecasts than the Treasury used to be.</strong> \"On public sector net borrowing \u2026 our errors are by and large smaller than the average errors were under the old regime [when the Treasury was in charge of producing forecasts for the government],\" he said, producing figures showing that seven out of nine of the OBR's borrowing forecasts to date had been shown to be more accurate than Treasury ones were. He also produced figures showing that the OBR's growth forecasts were more reliable than average Treasury ones. Asked to explain why the OBR got it so wrong when it predicted reasonable growth in 2011 and 2012, he said higher-than-expected inflation, particularly from oil prices and food prices, was mainly to blame.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the OBR should eventually be allowed to cost opposition policies. </strong>Under current legislation, it is banned from doing this. \"Having independent rigorous analysis of all the political parties' policies is a good thing for them, it's a good thing for public debate, it's a good thing for democracy,\" he said. He also suggested that the current arrangement, which will allow Osborne to go into the election saying his plans have been approved by the OBR while Ed Balls won't be able to make the same claim, was potentially unfair.</p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility, which was set up by Osborne after the election, sounds rather grand. But actually Chote's team is only about 20-strong and they operate from a rather poky office on Victoria Street. There are two-bit PR companies with larger headcounts and plusher premises.</p> <p>Chote used to run the Institute for Fiscal Studies (employing about 50 people), and helped to establish it as the thinktank most trusted to impartially dissect government and opposition fiscal policies. \"The fact that we looked at every party's plans, and normally said rude things about all of them, contributed to people's sense of our independence and our evenhandedness,\" he said. At the OBR he's more constrained because he's not allowed to comment on opposition policies, and whether they would be better than Osborne's. But in our interview he still managed to say at least two things likely to annoy Osborne (on the 50p top rate of tax, and public sector pensions), and one that will go down badly with Balls (on the reason for growth being much lower than expected). We spoke on Wednesday afternoon. Here's how it went.</p> <h2>Eurozone crisis</h2> <p><strong>Q: At his </strong><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/irspnote160512.pdf\" title=\"\"><strong>press conference on Wednesday morning (pdf)</strong></a><strong>, Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, seemed to be saying \u2013 and I paraphrase \u2013 that it was so difficult trying to work out the impact of Greece leaving the eurozone that there was no point even trying. The OBR's position is different, because in your last </strong><a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/pubs/March-2012-EFO1.pdf\" title=\"\"><strong>economic and fiscal outlook (pdf)</strong></a><strong>, you did try to quantify it. Can you summarise what would happen?</strong></p> <p>A: Fundamentally the governor is right, and we've taken a similar approach in most of the recent forecasts that we've done. If you think about the bad outcome for the eurozone, there are so many different ways in which that could unfold that picking any one and working out the consequences of that for the economy and the public finances, and saying that that is representative of the bad outcome, isn't particularly helpful. There's an awful lot of uncertainty. For example, if Greece were to come out, does that make people more confident about the stability and cohesion of what is left? Or are people more nervous because they fear there will be contagion?</p> <p>That said, you can say hopefully useful things about the sorts of ways in which greater difficulties in the eurozone might affect the UK and those that might be more or less important to the fiscal position, which is ultimately what we're interested in. The direct economic trade links between the UK and Greece are not that great. So it's less the direct effect than whether it leads to concerns about contagion and the stability of the system as a whole and, crucially, what impact that has on the smooth running of the financial system and the banking system.</p> <p>The concern is that you end up with an outcome in the eurozone that creates the same sort of structural difficulties in the financial system and in the economy that we saw in the past recession, and that that has consquences both for hitting economic activity in the economy, but also its underlying potential. And it's the latter which has particular difficulties for the fiscal position, because it means not just that the economy weakens and then strengthens again \u2013 ie, it goes into a hole and comes out \u2013 but that you go down and you never quite get back up to where you started. And that has more lingering, long-term consequences for the public finances.</p> <p>What we did in <a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/pubs/March-2012-EFO1.pdf\" title=\"\">this report (pdf)</a> was to say, for what it's worth, the OECD has come up with a story of how things might turn out. And we looked at that one.</p> <p><strong>And these figures [see page 177] suggest there would be negative growth for two years, deflation in 2013-14, unemployment higher than 10% and that the chancellor would miss his targets.</strong></p> <p>That's saying what would happen if this particular novelisation that the OECD came up with last year was to come up. But the point is that it could evolve in so many different ways. For example, one issue would be do difficulties in the eurozone make it cheaper or more expensive for the UK government to borrow? If it makes investors more nervous about risk in general, it might make it more expensive. If they see the UK as more of a safe haven, it might make it less expensive.</p> <p><strong>I suppose the question people really wanted answered is, how bad could it get? Can you answer that?</strong></p> <p>Well, no. The problem is that you would be coming up with one story and claiming it was representative. I think Mervyn's view is the right one, that you can't say there's a 10% chance that things will turn out like this. What you can say is let's take a way things could turn out and look what sort of effect it might have.</p> <h2>Reliability of OBR forecasts</h2> <p><strong>That takes us on to forecasting. In your </strong><a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/pubs/Forecast-evaluation-report-2011.pdf\" title=\"\"><strong>forecast evaluation report last year (pdf)</strong></a><strong> you said one of the advantages of having the OBR produce forecasts instead of the Treasury was that people could be confident that \"they are based on (inevitably fallible) professional judgment rather than politically motivated wishful thinking\". How much evidence do you think there is that governments did rig their forecasts?</strong></p> <p>\"Rig\" is not a word I would use. The key point about the pre-OBR regime is that these were ministerial forecasts and ministers were entirely entitled to forecast whatever they wanted. It's not as if they were fiddling the numbers. They were their numbers. Certainly if you look at the period for 2002 onwards, the then government published forecasts for public finances that the IFS and the National Institute [of Economic and Social Research] and probably the IMF and the OECD all thought were probably too optimistic.</p> <p>Another concern over that period was also the way in which the fiscal rules were written. There was a concern that it was easy to move the goalposts in such a way as to make them easier to hit. So I would not say in the past there's been \"rigging\". But I think there is a concern that governments of all stripes have an incentive to produce forecasts that do contain wishful thinking about the future. The creation of the OBR was, in part, a response to those sort of issues.</p> <p><strong>Is it your contention that having the OBR will create better forecasts? Or does it just create forecasts that are subject to the same degree of inaccuracy but people will \u2026</strong></p> <p>Think they're inaccurate for the right reasons.</p> <p><strong>Exactly.</strong></p> <p>That's a good way of putting it. You might want to distinguish between the forecasts we make for the economy and the forecasts we make for the public finances, tax revenues and spending and budget deficits and things like that. For the economy, we have no privileged secret information about what's going on in the economy that everybody else in the world doesn't have. So there's no reason to believe that we should be better forecasters for the economy than anybody else is.</p> <p>What we do have is additional information about what exactly is going on with public spending, what exactly is going on with tax receipts. We're able to have more discussions with people at HMRC about what is going on with tax receipts. So, for the fiscal forecasts, hopefully we are able to use that additional information.</p> <p><strong>When I posted a blog </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/15/robert-chote-office-budget-responsibility\" title=\"\"><strong>asking people to suggest questions I should ask you</strong></a><strong>, I was surprised how negative the comments were. A lot of them [for example, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/16133553\" title=\"\"><strong>Optymystic</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/16133907\" title=\"\"><strong>manzo</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/16138318\" title=\"\"><strong>hrwaldram</strong></a><strong>] focused on accuracy, with people saying your forecasts are no better, or if anything worse, than the Treasury ones were. On the key indicators, are you doing better than the Treasury or are you doing worse? </strong></p> <p>On the fiscal numbers, on public sector net borrowing (PSNB), for what it is worth \u2013 and we've only got a couple of years to go on \u2013 our errors are by and large smaller than the average errors were under the old regime.</p> <p>[At this point Chote produces a chart showing the accuracy of all PSNB forecasts made by the OBR since it was set up, where real figures are now available. The boxes are coded green if the error is below the average error incurred by the Treasury when it was doing these forecasts, yellow if it's in line with the average Treasury error, and red if it's worse than the average Treasury error. There are nine boxes: seven of them are green, one is yellow and one is red.]</p> <p><strong>But what about growth? If I had asked the people who were raising questions why they thought your forecasts were so bad, I think they would cite growth. Two years ago you were predicting growth of 2%-plus in 2012, and now it's 0.8% and coming down. People look at that and say that shows you're just as useless as the Treasury.</strong></p> <p>Judging that is harder because the numbers continue to be revised long after you think you know who's done a good forecast and who's done a bad one. That was very clear in 2010. All the forecasts we produced in 2010 under-estimated economic growth in 2010. If you go back even further in time, when I was writing about the economy for the Independent in the early 1990s, in the recession of the 1990s it looked like the economy had shrunk by 4.3% from top to bottom and it had ended in a double dip. That was the story I was writing on the national accounts of 1993. If you now look at the latest official data for exactly the same period, the recession is 40% shallower and there's no double dip.</p> <p><strong>So do you think if the Treasury had been doing the forecasts in 2010 for 2012, they would have made the same mistake that you made?</strong></p> <p>If you look at why growth appears to have been weaker in 2011 than we thought \u2013 and indeed I think that every one of the independent forecasters polled at the beginning of 2011, no one had anything as weak as 0.7, which is where we've ended up \u2013 the main reason for that appears to be the fact that there were pressures on inflation that were higher than people expected. Things like higher oil prices and food prices were squeezing household incomes, squeezing consumer spending.</p> <p>[At this point Chote produces another chart showing the accuracy of all growth forecasts made by the OBR since it was set up, where the real figures are now available. There are six boxes: three of them are green (ie, better than the average Treasury error), one is yellow (in line with the Treasury average) and two are red (worse than the Treasury average).]</p> <p><strong>You talk quite a lot about how forecasts are inherently unreliable. In your </strong><a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/pubs/Forecast-evaluation-report-2011.pdf\" title=\"\"><strong>forecast evaluation report (pdf)</strong></a><strong> last year you said: \"The chances of any economic or fiscal forecast being accurate in every dimension are infinitesimally small.\"</strong></p> <p>That's certainly true. You cannot just say this is difficult, so there's no point even trying. Governments have to take decisions today that have consequences about what things will look like in one, two, three, four years' time. In order to take those decisions in a sensible way, you have to start with some sort of view about how the world is going to look if you don't do anything or if you do do anything. So it is very difficult, but you still have to do it. The key thing that we're trying to demonstrate in the way we do it is, don't bet the farm on any particular view of the economy turning out to be correct. And it's not enough just to say there's uncertainty around the central view that we've set out. What you need to do is say how much does it matter if we're wrong, and in what sort of ways.</p> <h2>Relations with the Treasury</h2> <p><strong>People have criticised the OBR for being too close to Treasury thinking. When I asked people to suggest questions, Polly Toynbee sent me one on Twitter which was: \"Why has the OBR been so wildly optimistic, when Keynesians predicted double dip would be the result of extreme austerity?\"</strong></p> <p>And there's another set of views on the other side of the spectrum. We sit down, we puzzle over the data and the information and we reach the best view that we can, whether the Treasury agrees with that or not. Perhaps to my surprise, and to their credit, they don't come and say \"this is our view of the world, you agree, don't you?\" holding a large baseball bat up in the air. We all sit and discuss the uncertainties about what is going on. But at the end of the day the great discipline is transparency. We have to show our working. There will always be people who disagree with the view that you express. That's the nature of economics.</p> <p><strong>Going back to the Treasury, someone on the blog [</strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/16134197\" title=\"\"><strong>britannicus</strong></a><strong>] posted this question: \"Is it difficult to maintain an independent and objective stance on the government's fiscal performance when you are married to the Treasury's director general responsible for public spending [Sharon White]?\"</strong></p> <p>The short answer is not at all. She's a career civil servant. So she's worked for the previous Labour government, and the Tory government before that. The jobs I've had have involved me being rude about all of them.

But in most years, and on average over the five years, the takeaways and the giveaways pretty much wash out. So the budget was not doing very much to either inject into or subtract out of the economy additional spending power. The evidence on things like \"will this attract particularly innovative people who will have ongoing implications for productivity growth etc\", again, you would look at the size of the sums of money involved and at the evidence.

      "bodyText": "How bad is it going to get? As chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote is the government's independent forecaster-in-chief and the man responsible for checking that George Osborne's budget figures add up. In a wide-ranging interview, Chote discussed the eurozone crisis and much else. Here are the main points. \u2022 Chote said Greece leaving the euro could plunge Britain into a recession as bad as the last one, causing long-term damage to the economy. He stressed the difficulties of forecasting the economic consequences of a Greek exit, but acknowledged there was a danger \"not just that the economy weakens and then strengthens again \u2013 ie, it goes into a hole and comes out \u2013 but that you go down and you never quite get back up to where you started\". \u2022 He said there was no evidence to show that cutting the 50p top rate of tax would promote growth. \"We didn't feel that there was a strong enough evidence base to say our long-term or medium-term view of the economy is now more optimistic than it was beforehand as a result of that measure,\" he said. \u2022 He said current spending on public sector pensions was sustainable in the long-term. The public finances as a whole would come under pressure in years to come, but the current pension regime was \"not where the problem is coming from\", he said. \u2022 He claimed that the OBR was better at producing reliable forecasts than the Treasury used to be. \"On public sector net borrowing \u2026 our errors are by and large smaller than the average errors were under the old regime [when the Treasury was in charge of producing forecasts for the government],\" he said, producing figures showing that seven out of nine of the OBR's borrowing forecasts to date had been shown to be more accurate than Treasury ones were. He also produced figures showing that the OBR's growth forecasts were more reliable than average Treasury ones. Asked to explain why the OBR got it so wrong when it predicted reasonable growth in 2011 and 2012, he said higher-than-expected inflation, particularly from oil prices and food prices, was mainly to blame. \u2022 He said the OBR should eventually be allowed to cost opposition policies. Under current legislation, it is banned from doing this. \"Having independent rigorous analysis of all the political parties' policies is a good thing for them, it's a good thing for public debate, it's a good thing for democracy,\" he said. He also suggested that the current arrangement, which will allow Osborne to go into the election saying his plans have been approved by the OBR while Ed Balls won't be able to make the same claim, was potentially unfair. The Office for Budget Responsibility, which was set up by Osborne after the election, sounds rather grand. But actually Chote's team is only about 20-strong and they operate from a rather poky office on Victoria Street. There are two-bit PR companies with larger headcounts and plusher premises. Chote used to run the Institute for Fiscal Studies (employing about 50 people), and helped to establish it as the thinktank most trusted to impartially dissect government and opposition fiscal policies. \"The fact that we looked at every party's plans, and normally said rude things about all of them, contributed to people's sense of our independence and our evenhandedness,\" he said. At the OBR he's more constrained because he's not allowed to comment on opposition policies, and whether they would be better than Osborne's. But in our interview he still managed to say at least two things likely to annoy Osborne (on the 50p top rate of tax, and public sector pensions), and one that will go down badly with Balls (on the reason for growth being much lower than expected). We spoke on Wednesday afternoon. Here's how it went. Eurozone crisis Q: At his press conference on Wednesday morning (pdf), Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, seemed to be saying \u2013 and I paraphrase \u2013 that it was so difficult trying to work out the impact of Greece leaving the eurozone that there was no point even trying. The OBR's position is different, because in your last economic and fiscal outlook (pdf), you did try to quantify it. Can you summarise what would happen? A: Fundamentally the governor is right, and we've taken a similar approach in most of the recent forecasts that we've done. If you think about the bad outcome for the eurozone, there are so many different ways in which that could unfold that picking any one and working out the consequences of that for the economy and the public finances, and saying that that is representative of the bad outcome, isn't particularly helpful. There's an awful lot of uncertainty. For example, if Greece were to come out, does that make people more confident about the stability and cohesion of what is left? Or are people more nervous because they fear there will be contagion? That said, you can say hopefully useful things about the sorts of ways in which greater difficulties in the eurozone might affect the UK and those that might be more or less important to the fiscal position, which is ultimately what we're interested in. The direct economic trade links between the UK and Greece are not that great. So it's less the direct effect than whether it leads to concerns about contagion and the stability of the system as a whole and, crucially, what impact that has on the smooth running of the financial system and the banking system. The concern is that you end up with an outcome in the eurozone that creates the same sort of structural difficulties in the financial system and in the economy that we saw in the past recession, and that that has consquences both for hitting economic activity in the economy, but also its underlying potential. And it's the latter which has particular difficulties for the fiscal position, because it means not just that the economy weakens and then strengthens again \u2013 ie, it goes into a hole and comes out \u2013 but that you go down and you never quite get back up to where you started. And that has more lingering, long-term consequences for the public finances. What we did in this report (pdf) was to say, for what it's worth, the OECD has come up with a story of how things might turn out. And we looked at that one. And these figures [see page 177] suggest there would be negative growth for two years, deflation in 2013-14, unemployment higher than 10% and that the chancellor would miss his targets. That's saying what would happen if this particular novelisation that the OECD came up with last year was to come up. But the point is that it could evolve in so many different ways. For example, one issue would be do difficulties in the eurozone make it cheaper or more expensive for the UK government to borrow? If it makes investors more nervous about risk in general, it might make it more expensive. If they see the UK as more of a safe haven, it might make it less expensive. I suppose the question people really wanted answered is, how bad could it get? Can you answer that? Well, no. The problem is that you would be coming up with one story and claiming it was representative. I think Mervyn's view is the right one, that you can't say there's a 10% chance that things will turn out like this. What you can say is let's take a way things could turn out and look what sort of effect it might have. Reliability of OBR forecasts That takes us on to forecasting. In your forecast evaluation report last year (pdf) you said one of the advantages of having the OBR produce forecasts instead of the Treasury was that people could be confident that \"they are based on (inevitably fallible) professional judgment rather than politically motivated wishful thinking\". How much evidence do you think there is that governments did rig their forecasts? \"Rig\" is not a word I would use. The key point about the pre-OBR regime is that these were ministerial forecasts and ministers were entirely entitled to forecast whatever they wanted. It's not as if they were fiddling the numbers. They were their numbers. Certainly if you look at the period for 2002 onwards, the then government published forecasts for public finances that the IFS and the National Institute [of Economic and Social Research] and probably the IMF and the OECD all thought were probably too optimistic. Another concern over that period was also the way in which the fiscal rules were written. There was a concern that it was easy to move the goalposts in such a way as to make them easier to hit. So I would not say in the past there's been \"rigging\". But I think there is a concern that governments of all stripes have an incentive to produce forecasts that do contain wishful thinking about the future. The creation of the OBR was, in part, a response to those sort of issues. Is it your contention that having the OBR will create better forecasts? Or does it just create forecasts that are subject to the same degree of inaccuracy but people will \u2026 Think they're inaccurate for the right reasons. Exactly. That's a good way of putting it. You might want to distinguish between the forecasts we make for the economy and the forecasts we make for the public finances, tax revenues and spending and budget deficits and things like that. For the economy, we have no privileged secret information about what's going on in the economy that everybody else in the world doesn't have. So there's no reason to believe that we should be better forecasters for the economy than anybody else is. What we do have is additional information about what exactly is going on with public spending, what exactly is going on with tax receipts. We're able to have more discussions with people at HMRC about what is going on with tax receipts. So, for the fiscal forecasts, hopefully we are able to use that additional information. When I posted a blog asking people to suggest questions I should ask you, I was surprised how negative the comments were. A lot of them [for example, Optymystic, manzo and hrwaldram] focused on accuracy, with people saying your forecasts are no better, or if anything worse, than the Treasury ones were. On the key indicators, are you doing better than the Treasury or are you doing worse? On the fiscal numbers, on public sector net borrowing (PSNB), for what it is worth \u2013 and we've only got a couple of years to go on \u2013 our errors are by and large smaller than the average errors were under the old regime. [At this point Chote produces a chart showing the accuracy of all PSNB forecasts made by the OBR since it was set up, where real figures are now available. The boxes are coded green if the error is below the average error incurred by the Treasury when it was doing these forecasts, yellow if it's in line with the average Treasury error, and red if it's worse than the average Treasury error. There are nine boxes: seven of them are green, one is yellow and one is red.] But what about growth? If I had asked the people who were raising questions why they thought your forecasts were so bad, I think they would cite growth. Two years ago you were predicting growth of 2%-plus in 2012, and now it's 0.8% and coming down. People look at that and say that shows you're just as useless as the Treasury. Judging that is harder because the numbers continue to be revised long after you think you know who's done a good forecast and who's done a bad one. That was very clear in 2010. All the forecasts we produced in 2010 under-estimated economic growth in 2010. If you go back even further in time, when I was writing about the economy for the Independent in the early 1990s, in the recession of the 1990s it looked like the economy had shrunk by 4.3% from top to bottom and it had ended in a double dip. That was the story I was writing on the national accounts of 1993. If you now look at the latest official data for exactly the same period, the recession is 40% shallower and there's no double dip. So do you think if the Treasury had been doing the forecasts in 2010 for 2012, they would have made the same mistake that you made? If you look at why growth appears to have been weaker in 2011 than we thought \u2013 and indeed I think that every one of the independent forecasters polled at the beginning of 2011, no one had anything as weak as 0.7, which is where we've ended up \u2013 the main reason for that appears to be the fact that there were pressures on inflation that were higher than people expected. Things like higher oil prices and food prices were squeezing household incomes, squeezing consumer spending. [At this point Chote produces another chart showing the accuracy of all growth forecasts made by the OBR since it was set up, where the real figures are now available. There are six boxes: three of them are green (ie, better than the average Treasury error), one is yellow (in line with the Treasury average) and two are red (worse than the Treasury average).] You talk quite a lot about how forecasts are inherently unreliable. In your forecast evaluation report (pdf) last year you said: \"The chances of any economic or fiscal forecast being accurate in every dimension are infinitesimally small.\" That's certainly true. You cannot just say this is difficult, so there's no point even trying. Governments have to take decisions today that have consequences about what things will look like in one, two, three, four years' time. In order to take those decisions in a sensible way, you have to start with some sort of view about how the world is going to look if you don't do anything or if you do do anything. So it is very difficult, but you still have to do it. The key thing that we're trying to demonstrate in the way we do it is, don't bet the farm on any particular view of the economy turning out to be correct. And it's not enough just to say there's uncertainty around the central view that we've set out. What you need to do is say how much does it matter if we're wrong, and in what sort of ways. Relations with the Treasury People have criticised the OBR for being too close to Treasury thinking. When I asked people to suggest questions, Polly Toynbee sent me one on Twitter which was: \"Why has the OBR been so wildly optimistic, when Keynesians predicted double dip would be the result of extreme austerity?\" And there's another set of views on the other side of the spectrum. We sit down, we puzzle over the data and the information and we reach the best view that we can, whether the Treasury agrees with that or not. Perhaps to my surprise, and to their credit, they don't come and say \"this is our view of the world, you agree, don't you?\" holding a large baseball bat up in the air. We all sit and discuss the uncertainties about what is going on. But at the end of the day the great discipline is transparency. We have to show our working. There will always be people who disagree with the view that you express. That's the nature of economics. Going back to the Treasury, someone on the blog [britannicus] posted this question: \"Is it difficult to maintain an independent and objective stance on the government's fiscal performance when you are married to the Treasury's director general responsible for public spending [Sharon White]?\" The short answer is not at all. She's a career civil servant. So she's worked for the previous Labour government, and the Tory government before that. The jobs I've had have involved me being rude about all of them. It has never stopped me in the past and it wouldn't stop me now. Clearly, I felt it was very important when she got that job that we should be transparent about it, so it went straight up on our website when she was appointed and I made sure that the Treasury committee was informed before it happened just so that there weren't any concerns about it. Allowing the OBR to cost opposition policies The legislation setting up the OBR says you can't look at the impact of opposition policies. But at some point they're going to review the operation of the OBR. Do you think there's a case for changing the legislation to allow you to cost Ed Balls' policies? It is certainly something that parliament should come back to in that five-year review. I said when I was appointed that I thought parliament should be very clear with us whether they wanted us to do that or not. I said if parliament did not give a view one way or another, I would talk about the implications of opposition policies. The Australians are setting up a parliamentary budget office as we speak, which is very much focused at providing the research resources for opposition members to be able to go to this body and say: \"I've got a pet plan to change income tax, could you please run the slide-rule over it.\" If you do that it's quite expensive, because you have to have quite a lot of expertise in quite a lot of different areas. There's a then even more dramatic example of this in the Netherlands, where every political party in the runup to the election is invited to submit its manifesto to our Dutch equivalent. The Dutch office is multiple times larger than we are, partly because you need to have more resources available to do that. One of the consequences of this system is that George Osborne will be able to stand up and say to the voters, \"here are my budget plans, they've been kitemarked by the OBR\", because he's in government. But Ed Balls won't be able to do that. Do you think there's an inherent unfairness in that?

I think at the end of the day that having independent rigorous analysis of all the political parties' policies is a good thing for them, it's a good thing for public debate, it's a good thing for democracy.

Partly because no party has the monopoly of wisdom or folly, so you normally offending all of them some of the time. Economic effect of cutting the 50p top rate of tax Is there any evidence that cutting the 50p top rate of tax will be good for the economy in terms of promoting growth because it will make people work harder, or make people come to the UK to invest? We didn't think that there was a reason to adjust our medium- or long-term growth forecasts on the basis of that. That was certainly the view that we took back in March. Is that because the evidence is unobtainable? Or is that because that effect probably doesn't apply? Well, there's a size issue.

Overall, Stagecoach operates around 1,900 buses and coaches in the US and Canada, including commuter and transit services as well as tours and some school bus services. Separately, Stagecoach will be operating the first hybrid tram-trains in Britain, the Department for Transport announced on Friday. A \u00a358m pilot scheme will test the tram-trains on both rail and tram networks in Sheffield, where they run on both tramways and train tracks from the city centre to suburbs out to Rotherham.

In a fairer world, these vulnerable citizens would be entitled to claw back the salaries, official privileges, and bonuses that the four parties to blame enjoyed for too long. In the world as it is, they are a compelling lesson for the future. Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2012.",

    "webTitle": "Barack Obama tells EU: boost growth now or face a global crisis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barack Obama is to put pressure on Germany to ease the pain of austerity with policies to boost growth, as he uses two days of talks with the G8 industrial nations to warn Europe that it needs to act swiftly to spare the world economy from a second deep recession in four years. Prior to the G8 summit at Camp David this weekend, a warning from the ratings agency Fitch that Greece's days in the single currency could be numbered heightened fears in Washington that the worsening crisis in the eurozone poses a threat to America's fragile recovery and President Obama's re-election chances. Obama will welcome the new French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, as a potential ally in his push for Europe to follow the US in giving a higher priority to expansionary policies, and as a counterweight to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Obama can expect support from David Cameron, who told Merkel and Hollande on Thursday that eurozone leaders must embark on a series of urgent steps to prop up the single currency if a major implosion across the continent is to be avoided. In a video conference with fellow EU leaders, the prime minister warned of a \"remorseless logic\" which dictates that struggling members of a single currency are supported by stronger members. \"The prime minister emphasised the importance of Greece and the eurozone taking decisive action to ensure financial stability and prevent contagion,\" a Downing Street spokesperson said. The video conference included Mario Monti, the Italian prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, and Herman van Rompuy, president of the European Council. Investors again turned to safe havens, fearing political chaos and economic collapse in Greece having knock-on effects for the global economy. Spain was the main focus of concern, amid reports \u2013 denied by the economy minister \u2013 of a run on Bankia, the country's fourth-biggest bank. Fitch waited for European markets to close before downgrading Greece's credit rating from B- to CCC. \"The downgrade of Greece's sovereign ratings reflects the heightened risk that Greece may not be able to sustain its membership of economic and monetary union (EMU) ... In the event that the new general elections scheduled for 17 June fail to produce a government with a mandate to continue with the EU-IMF [International Monetary Fund] programme of fiscal austerity and structural reform, an exit of Greece from EMU would be probable,\" Fitch said. Leaders of the west's most powerful economies have been meeting for informal talks every year since the oil shock of 1973 brought an end to the postwar boom, and while Obama is not expecting any major decision to emerge from Camp David, it will be a chance for the Americans to vent their frustration that Europe has failed to find a lasting solution to its debt crisis, which is now in its third year. In Greece, there were hopes that the deposit outflows from banks had reduced. But Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of Britain's biggest bank, HSBC, said: \"We're in a worse place than we were a week ago. It remains a very difficult thing to call. I think the second [Greek] election in June will be a referendum on whether to stay in the euro. A month is a very long way away. We are now seeing price action that is consistent with capitulation.\" Gulliver said if Greece left the eurozone, a firewall would need to be erected around Spain. If there was a run on banks in Greece, it might not be possible to wait for the elections on 17 June. He said his biggest worry \"is absolutely how the eurozone plays out \u2013 whether Greece stays in, whether firewalls are high enough to protect Spain and, frankly, whether markets take things into their own hands before 17 June\". Alistair Darling, Labour's chancellor at the time of the Lehman Brothers collapse, said: \"From my own experience, these things can blow up in a matter of hours. The slow bleeding of Greek banks should worry everyone. Europe for the last two years has been running round like headless chickens. It's no wonder people now think things will go wrong.\"",
