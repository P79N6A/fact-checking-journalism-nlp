      "bodyText": "Barclays and Credit Suisse has been fined $154m (\u00a3108m) following an investigation into the banks\u2019 \u201cdark pools\u201d private trading exchanges exploited by \u201cpredatory, high-frequency traders\u201d at the expense of the bank\u2019s traditonal customers. Eric Schneiderman, attorney general of New York state, said the fines were a \u201cmajor victory in the fight to combat fraud in dark pool trading\u201d and would help protect investors from \u201cthe most aggressive and predatory high-speed traders\u201d. Barclays will pay $70m, the largest ever fine for operating a dark pool, and has admitted that it misled investors and violated securities laws and has agreed that it will install an independent monitor to oversee its \u201cBarclays LX\u201d. The fine settles a high profile lawsuit Schneiderman brought against Barclays in June 2014 as part of his office\u2019s \u201cInsider Trading 2.0\u201d crackdown on electronic trading in the wake of Michael Lewis\u2019s bestselling book and blockbuster movie Flash Boys. Dark pools are private exchanges for trading stocks and bonds, but unlike traditional markets there are no public prices and trades can be carried out in secret which can favour high speed traders. Schneiderman said Barclays had told its dark pool clients that it monitored for high-speed trading, but it didn\u2019t and it actually favoured high-speed traders. This meant that traditional players thought they were only up against other traditional traders when actually they were facing \u201cthe most aggressive and predatory high-speed traders,\u201d he said. Barclays and Credit Suisse each made \u201cfalse statements and omissions in connection with the marketing of their respective dark pools and other high-speed electronic equities trading services,\u201d Schneiderman said in his news release. \u201cThis effort, which began when we first sued Barclays, includes co-ordinated and aggressive government action which forced admissions of wrongdoing from the parties,\u201d Schneiderman said. \u201cWe will continue to take the fight to those who aim to rig the system and those who look the other way.\u201d Mary Jo White, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said: \u201cThese cases are the most recent in a series of strong SEC enforcement actions involving dark pools and other alternative trading systems.\u201d White said the SEC would continue in its efforts to \u201cshed light on dark pools to better protect investors\u201d. Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC\u2019s enforcement division, said: \u201cDark pools have a significant role in today\u2019s equity marketplace, and the firms that run these venues must ensure that they do not make misstatements to subscribers about their material operations.\u201d Barclays, which has a big operation in New York, said the bank was pleased to resolve the case. \u201cThe agreement will enable us to focus all of our efforts on serving our clients,\u201d the bank said. Credit Suisse was fined $60m fine split between the SEC and NY attorney-general\u2019s office, as well as a further $24.3m in disgorgement \u2014 which is designed to make it pay back ill-gotten gains - in relation to its dark pool called \u201cCrossfinder\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Labour has warned against returning to the \u201cdark days of Railtrack\u201d as it emerged that senior rail industry leaders have been exploring the breakup and privatisation of Network Rail. Freshly published minutes of a November meeting of the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which includes train operators and Network Rail, show that executives discussed privatising the rail infrastructure along the lines of utility firms. The government commissioned an independent review of Network Rail\u2019s structure and financing to be conducted by Nicola Shaw, the chief executive of HS1, after spiralling costs led to the shelving of promised rail upgrades in its \u00a338.3bn five-year plan last June. Shaw is due to report in time for a potential announcement by George Osborne in the 2016 budget. In discussing its own submission to Shaw\u2019s work two months ago, train companies suggested that the privatisation of utilities companies was a precedent to follow, arguing that routes needed to be removed from Network Rail\u2019s control. However, moves to privatise the infrastructure would be highly controversial given the experience of the late 1990s, when a series of disasters occurred under the Railtrack regime. Shaw\u2019s initial scoping report set out options that ranged from \u201cfull privatisation to full nationalisation\u201d. Network Rail\u2019s chief executive, Mark Carne, has proposed devolution of many functions to regional route managers. But others at the RDG favoured a full breakup, arguing that his plan could fail to \u201cattract investors if the centre was still holding control\u201d. The minutes say that the group \u2013 which included the bosses of most UK train operators, as well as Carne \u2013 \u201cexplored the issue in more detail, considering the privatisation of utility services and London Buses, and the UKFI, as alternative models, and the various funding options available\u201d. Lilian Greenwood, Labour\u2019s shadow transport spokeswoman, urged the government not to repeat the mistakes of Railtrack. \u201cThere are areas where Network Rail needs to improve but more fragmentation and more privatisation are the last thing that passengers need. Selling off our rail infrastructure shouldn\u2019t even be on the table but the government is actively deciding whether to press ahead,\u201d said Greenwood. \u201cSuch a policy risks dragging us back to the dark days of Railtrack when passengers\u2019 safety was endangered and the country\u2019s network ground to a halt. The Conservative party tested the theory to destruction 20 years ago but it seems that they have learned nothing from the mistakes of the past. \u201cIf rail services are to improve then we need more public ownership, not less. Ministers must reject these calls from train companies and rule out the privatisation of Network Rail.\u201d The RDG\u2019s eventual submission to the Shaw review did not take a formal position and said there was a range of views expressed by members, but it included a proposal for a partial sell-off of a section of the rail network in England to test the water. It stated: \u201cThere are options for early sale of an English route \u2026 Such a sale would introduce an alternative source of finance and greater local focus on customers, clients and stakeholders as well as creating a truly independent comparator which could help to create more effective incentives for improvement in the remaining routes. Following any initial sale, it would be possible to sell further routes but a decision on this could be made in the light of progress and results.\u201d Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the RDG, said it was right to consider how best to manage the railway infrastructure. \u201cNicola Shaw has set out the sale of Network Rail routes as one of many options she is considering as part of her review and our members have therefore discussed its merit.\u201d \u201cTrain companies support the plans for devolution already set out by Network Rail as a way to increase accountability, but also believe it\u2019s important to retain the benefits of a single national network. There is a broad range of views among our members about the appropriate pace and extent of any further change beyond those already set out by Network Rail,\u201d Plummer added. While the privatisation of utilities such as water and electricity, which were split up into private sector firms in the early 1990s, caused controversy over higher tariffs, the safety record associated with similar moves in rail has made it potentially even more politically fraught. Network Rail was established after the brief and disastrous tenure of Railtrack between 1996 and 2002, which went into administration after a series of fatal accidents culminating in the Hatfield disaster in 2000. Railtrack was also criticised for mismanagement that was most spectacularly shown in the \u00a39bn upgrade of the westcoast mainline, more than three times its original budget.",

    "webTitle": "Has the Bank of England governor been caught bluffing on interest rates?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It will probably be \u201cno change\u201d at the Bank of England this week, with policymakers expected to keep interest rates at their historic low again. The monetary policy committee meets on Thursday and in all probability will sit on its hands for the 83rd straight month. Most likely the MPC will keep the base rate at 0.5% for the rest of the year. Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, has said the central bank might be forced to cut rates if the global economy, brought low by China\u2019s faltering manufacturing sector, keeps sliding backwards. Just nine months ago it was all so different. Governor Mark Carney was warning City investors not to bet against a rate rise. His message was as much for Britain\u2019s mortgage payers as it was the bankers. Don\u2019t go on a spending binge with the proceeds of unnaturally low rates, he implied, higher borrowing costs are coming down the track. A generous view of Carney\u2019s speeches at the time would be that he understood the world economy was too weak to raise rates and the only way for him to overcome a sense of complacency among borrowers was to deliver a message that would, over time, be revealed as hollow, but did the trick at the time. If it was a ploy, it was one he repeated in autumn when he almost derided Haldane\u2019s concerns that the post-crash global economy was in difficulty and might need a cut in rates to boost investment and spending. Wise heads nodded and muttered about Haldane\u2019s alienation on the monetary policy committee. Carney\u2019s voice was cool, and above all positive. He was forced to change his stance in the new year when figures from China that were expected to show a bottoming out of its 18-month slowdown instead revealed a further descent. That triggered another collapse in commodities, for which China is the biggest market. Oil prices hit $27 per barrel, after starting 2014 above $115. Copper, zinc and steel have likewise tumbled in price. This leaves Carney in the same position as every gambler who succeeds by luck and bluffing. You must ask yourself how long before someone twigs. There were a handful in the City and the academic community who said the Bank\u2019s forecasting was deeply flawed. Like James Bond in Casino Royale, they detected an opponent who was bluffing. Arch criminal Le Chiffre thinks he has everyone fooled, but a twitchy finger on his temple tells the MI6 agent his hand is weak. Carney doesn\u2019t twitch or stroke his ear when rattled. Yet he has been bluffing for so long it\u2019s a wonder the British public still pays him any attention. All last year he told us that interest rates were going to rise sooner rather than later. And now he says the opposite. He would say the facts changed. But have they really? Apart from the US, all major central banks have talked about coping with a deteriorating situation for at least the last year. His defence can also count on the small group of economists who argue he was not bullish enough then and even now should just get on with lifting borrowing costs. This group looks narrowly at the UK\u2019s rising employment levels, rising wages (relative to zero inflation), healthy corporate profits and vigorous banking system and argues that the recovery is complete. Normal service from the Bank of England, in the form of higher interest rates, should now resume, they argue. Yet this analysis ignores the outside world and the fact that around a third of Britain\u2019s GDP relates to trade with the outside world. This has many knock-on effects, meaning the UK catches a cold when others sneeze. That metaphor once belonged to our relationship with the US, but now applies to Europe and east Asia, which has become the fulcrum of the world\u2019s manufacturing. This brings us back to Haldane\u2019s point and the likelihood that the next change in policy is the announcement of a cut, not a rise. The MPC could cut the base rate to zero, or even go further and charge depositors for parking their money in Threadneedle Street. That would put it in good company; the European Central Bank already imposes negative interest rates and since last week, so does the Japanese central bank. Both the ECB in Frankfurt and Tokyo\u2019s Bank of Japan aim to generate consumer and business demand with a costly disincentive to save. It is a message to domestic firms and shoppers alike to spend. It is also a message to foreign savers to take their money elsewhere, with the crucial side-effect that a fall in demand for the host currency will make its value fall. That is the express aim of the Japanese move to negative interest rates and the disguised motive of Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB. A lower value currency increases the cost of imports and domestic prices. This increase in inflation will counteract the drag on prices from falling oil prices. Most importantly, it also cuts the cost of exported goods, which should increase demand abroad, raise production and employment, wages and consumer demand. If Japan and Europe have chosen this route to boost their domestic economies, who is Britain to stand aside? When we resisted currency depreciation in the five years ahead of the 2008 crash, the pound was almost worth $2 and hampered large areas of manufacturing industry. Carney knows this. A sense of embarrassment will stop the MPC from cutting rates, but there will be plenty of hints to that effect. Carney will be bluffing again in his speeches when he talks about the possibility of following Draghi and his Tokyo counterpart, Haruhiko Kuroda. But bluffing is what he does best. And all the time he will hope the cards are kind to him. He knows cutting rates will have only limited benefit and raising them risks choking off what recovery there is. These are desperate times for central bankers. They are the guardians of prosperity.",

Most likely the MPC will keep the base rate at 0.5% for the rest of the year.</p> <p>Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, has said the central bank might be forced to cut rates if the global economy, brought low by China\u2019s faltering manufacturing sector, keeps sliding backwards.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/31/bird-plane-super-thursday-bank-of-england-interest-rates\">Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it\u2019s Super Thursday</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just nine months ago it was all so different. Governor Mark Carney was warning City investors not to bet against a rate rise. His message was as much for Britain\u2019s mortgage payers as it was the bankers. Don\u2019t go on a spending binge with the proceeds of unnaturally low rates, he implied, higher borrowing costs are coming down the track.</p> <p>A generous view of Carney\u2019s speeches at the time would be that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/01/who-is-the-bank-of-england-kidding-interest-rates-are-going-nowhere\">he understood the world economy was too weak to raise rates</a> and the only way for him to overcome a sense of complacency among borrowers was to deliver a message that would, over time, be revealed as hollow, but did the trick at the time.</p> <p>If it was a ploy, it was one he repeated in autumn when he almost derided Haldane\u2019s concerns that the post-crash global economy was in difficulty and might need a cut in rates to boost investment and spending.</p> <p>Wise heads nodded and muttered about Haldane\u2019s alienation on the monetary policy committee. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/aug/30/mark-carney-interest-rates-misses-clouds-on-the-horizon\">Carney\u2019s voice was cool, and above all positive</a>.</p> <p>He was forced to change his stance in the new year when figures from China that were expected to show a bottoming out of its 18-month slowdown instead revealed a further descent. That triggered another collapse in commodities, for which China is the biggest market. Oil prices hit $27 per barrel, after starting 2014 above $115. Copper, zinc and steel have likewise tumbled in price.</p> <p>This leaves Carney in the same position as every gambler who succeeds by luck and bluffing. You must ask yourself how long before someone twigs. </p> <p>There were a handful in the City and the academic community who said the Bank\u2019s forecasting was deeply flawed. Like James Bond in Casino Royale, they detected an opponent who was bluffing. Arch criminal Le Chiffre thinks he has everyone fooled, but a twitchy finger on his temple tells the MI6 agent his hand is weak.</p> <p>Carney doesn\u2019t twitch or stroke his ear when rattled. Yet he has been bluffing for so long it\u2019s a wonder the British public still pays him any attention. All last year he told us that interest rates were going to rise sooner rather than later. And now he says the opposite.</p> <p>He would say the facts changed. But have they really? Apart from the US, all major central banks have talked about coping with a deteriorating situation for at least the last year.</p> <p>His defence can also count on the small group of economists who argue he was not bullish enough then and even now should just get on with lifting borrowing costs.</p> <p>This group looks narrowly at the UK\u2019s rising employment levels, rising wages (relative to zero inflation), healthy corporate profits and vigorous banking system and argues that the recovery is complete. Normal service from the Bank of England, in the form of higher interest rates, should now resume, they argue.</p> <p>Yet this analysis ignores the outside world and the fact that around a third of Britain\u2019s GDP relates to trade with the outside world. This has many knock-on effects, meaning the UK catches a cold when others sneeze. That metaphor once belonged to our relationship with the US, but now applies to Europe and east Asia, which has become the fulcrum of the world\u2019s manufacturing.<br></p> <p>This brings us back to Haldane\u2019s point and the likelihood that the next change in policy is the announcement of a cut, not a rise. </p> <p>The MPC could cut the base rate to zero, or even go further and charge depositors for parking their money in Threadneedle Street. That would put it in good company; the European Central Bank already imposes negative interest rates and since last week, so does the Japanese central bank.</p> <p>Both the ECB in Frankfurt and Tokyo\u2019s Bank of Japan aim to generate consumer and business demand with a costly disincentive to save. It is a message to domestic firms and shoppers alike to spend. It is also a message to foreign savers to take their money elsewhere, with the crucial side-effect that a fall in demand for the host currency will make its value fall.</p> <p>That is the express aim of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/10/bank-of-england-expected-to-leave-interest-rates-at-05\">the Japanese move to negative interest rates</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27717594\">disguised motive of Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB</a>. </p> <p>A lower value currency increases the cost of imports and domestic prices. This increase in inflation will counteract the drag on prices from falling oil prices. Most importantly, it also cuts the cost of exported goods, which should increase demand abroad, raise production and employment, wages and consumer demand.</p> <p>If Japan and Europe have chosen this route to boost their domestic economies, who is Britain to stand aside? When we resisted currency depreciation in the five years ahead of the 2008 crash, the pound was almost worth $2 and hampered large areas of manufacturing industry.</p> <p>Carney knows this. A sense of embarrassment will stop the MPC from cutting rates, but there will be plenty of hints to that effect. Carney will be bluffing again in his speeches when he talks about the possibility of following Draghi and his Tokyo counterpart, Haruhiko Kuroda. But bluffing is what he does best.</p> <p>And all the time he will hope the cards are kind to him. He knows cutting rates will have only limited benefit and raising them risks choking off what recovery there is.</p> <p>These are desperate times for central bankers. They are the guardians of prosperity. </p>",

The debate, tabled by Conservative MP Guto Bebb, will discuss \u201cthat this House believes that the Financial Conduct Authority in its current form is not fit for purpose; and has no confidence in its existing structure and procedures\u201d. Speaking ahead of the debate, Bebb, who has campaigned for better treatment for small business, said he was motivated to table the debate after the FCA pulled its review into banking culture at the end of last year. \u201cAnybody who knows banks will find it impossible to say that bank behaviour was [not] motivated by financial inducement,\u201d the MP for Aberconwy said. \u201cWe need to have a proper debate about what is going on with the FCA, how independent are they,\u201d said Bebb. The decision by the FCA to abandon a review into the culture of banks sparked a series of accusations that the Treasury had intervened \u2013 strongly denied by both the regulator and the Treasury \u2013 as part of a softer approach to the City. The motion will be heard just days after George Osborne stunned the City by naming Andrew Bailey, a deputy governor of the Bank of England and the head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, as the chief executive of the FCA. Labour MP John Mann is co-sponsoring the motion and said he has no confidence in the regulator. \u201cIt is not fit for purpose,\u201d said Mann, who sits on the Treasury select committee. He is concerned the FCA\u2019s focus is shifting from so-called conduct issues to prudential regulation. \u201cOn Monday I will reveal in the House of Commons a new scandal which the FCA is trying to sweep under the carpet, providing further proof that we need a strong, independent regulator, not another lackey for George Osborne and the banks,\u201d said Mann. Mann is expected to accuse the FCA of failing to regulate foreign exchange firms tightly enough, to ensure they don\u2019t offer misleading exchange rates to consumers. The FCA has only been in existence since April 2013 when the coalition government disbanded the-then City regulator, the Financial Services Authority. The FCA was given responsibility for overseeing the behaviour of the City and the PRA, inside the Bank of England, was charged with regulating whether banks and insurance companies were strong enough to withstand market turbulence. The FCA and the Treasury declined to comment ahead of the debate. When Bailey was appointed, Osborne had said his appointment was \u201can important next step in the establishment of the FCA as a strong regulator, independent of government and industry\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Sampriti Bhattacharyya read about a controversial US Navy scheme in which dolphins try to locate sea mines she realised the true potential of the robot she was working on. Bhattacharyya\u2019s underwater device, about the size of a football, had been developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a tool to detect cracks or splits in nuclear reactor tanks. When Bhattacharyya saw that dolphins were being used to detect mines and locate equipment lost underwater, a world of possibilities opened up \u2013 among them mapping the ocean floor or scanning the hull of ships for contraband. \u201cThat made me realise that my robot could be very useful. It is so cheap and easy to make, I could actually make a bunch of them and they could spread out and scan ship hulls,\u201d says the Indian engineer. Bhattacharyya is developing the prototype of an underwater drone which she hopes will provide a cheap way to map vast swaths of the ocean and chart the underwater landscape. The drones, named Evie (Ellipsoidal Vehicle for Inspection and Exploration), could also be used to search for plane wreckage, such as in the case of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, she says. The drone, from Bhattacharyya\u2019s company Hydroswarm, uses a series of jets to propel itself through the water and manoeuvre in different directions. It includes a battery and various interchangeable sensors depending on what task the drone is carrying out. It could plug in electronics for monitoring the quality of water or for measuring pollution from an oil spill. \u201cIt is a platform where you can plug and play any kinds of sensors that you want,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is very much like an aerial drone.\u201d Cameras can also be installed, although they will only work where natural light illuminates the water. Below that point, ultrasound sensors can be used to return images. The first drones will be able to travel up to 250m (820ft) below the surface, according to Bhattacharyya, whose aims to deepen the search in later models. The drones are being designed to work either individually or as a group, she says, and will be able to communicate with each other. A group of the drones all individually fitted with hydrophones \u2013 microphones that can detect soundwaves underwater \u2013 could be used to scan sections of the seabed. This swarm of devices would be a more cost-effective and practical approach than using larger and more expensive autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), robots which travel underwater. \u201cI was thinking that we don\u2019t have the technology to find a massive 747 in the ocean and if you break down the physics of the problem, all you are searching for is a ping [from the black box]. And if you break it down further all you need to hear the ping is a cheap hydrophone,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy not have a network of distributed hydrophones over a large area that can all sync. Each of them has their own ID and location. If I hear a ping after a transmission, they all rise up. If any of them have heard it, they upload it [the details] to a satellite and you know where the ping is coming from.\u201d Her principle focus for the drones is to map the ocean floor, an area which is largely undetailed at present. In 2014, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California published a map of the ocean floor with a resolution of 5km per pixel, using satellites to detail the landscape including large underwater mountains and ridges. More detailed maps made using ship sonar systems have mapped between 10% and 15%, about the size of Africa. Bhattacharyya says the drones could also help identify areas populated by particular fish, or plot dying coral reefs. \u201cWe know less about the ocean than we do about the moon\u2019s surface. What I want to do is make a whole map of the ocean,\u201d she says. Her ultimate ambition, though, is to map the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world\u2019s oceans and found in the western Pacific. But at 11km deep, the Mariana Trench is many times deeper than the maximum range of the early drone models. The drones are still being tested in labs and Bhattacharyya admits she will have many hurdles in front of her if she wants to launch Evie on the market in 18 months. \u201cMost of us don\u2019t know much about the ocean and there will be a lot of new difficulties we have no idea how to deal with; that we will have to encounter when we put it in the middle of the ocean.\u201d A consumer version of the drone is also planned. It will operate in a similar manner to aeriel drones currently on the market which can film the user from a distance, used often by skiers when skiing or in ground-controlled aerial photography. Bhattacharyya estimates these will cost between \u00a3700 ($1,000) and \u00a31,000 ($1,500). \u2022You can read our archive of The innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

This swarm of devices would be a more cost-effective and practical approach than using larger and more expensive autonomous underwater vehicles (<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/10764657/Malaysia-Airlines-MH370-undersea-robot-hunts-for-missing-plane.html\">AUVs</a>), robots which travel underwater.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking that we don\u2019t have the technology to find a massive 747 in the ocean and if you break down the physics of the problem, all you are searching for is a ping [from the black box]. And if you break it down further all you need to hear the ping is a cheap hydrophone,\u201d she says. </p> <p>\u201cWhy not have a network of distributed hydrophones over a large area that can all sync. Each of them has their own ID and location. If I hear a ping after a transmission, they all rise up. If any of them have heard it, they upload it [the details] to a satellite and you know where the ping is coming from.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pjTHDdC3C4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3pjTHDdC3C4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Hydroswarm\u2019s Prototype Demo Reel.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Her principle focus for the drones is to map the ocean floor, an area which is <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/just-how-little-do-we-know-about-the-ocean-floor-32751\">largely undetailed at present</a>. In 2014, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California published a map of the ocean floor with a resolution of 5km per pixel, using satellites to detail the landscape including large underwater mountains and ridges. More detailed maps made using ship sonar systems have mapped between 10% and 15%, about the size of Africa.</p> <p>Bhattacharyya says the drones could also help identify areas populated by particular fish, or plot dying coral reefs.</p> <p>\u201cWe know less about the ocean than we do about the moon\u2019s surface. What I want to do is make a whole map of the ocean,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Her ultimate ambition, though, is to map the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/gallery/2012/mar/26/james-cameron-mariana-trench-solo\">Mariana Trench</a>, the deepest part of the world\u2019s oceans and found in the western Pacific. But at 11km deep, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/gallery/2012/mar/26/james-cameron-mariana-trench-solo\">Mariana Trench</a> is many times deeper than the maximum range of the early drone models.</p> <p>The drones are still being tested in labs and Bhattacharyya admits she will have many hurdles in front of her if she wants to launch Evie on the market in 18 months. \u201cMost of us don\u2019t know much about the ocean and there will be a lot of new difficulties we have no idea how to deal with; that we will have to encounter when we put it in the middle of the ocean.\u201d</p> <p>A consumer version of the drone is also planned. It will operate in a similar manner to aeriel drones currently on the market which <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/lily-drone-flying-selfie-camera-follows-you-around-as-you-ski-or-run-10250471.html\">can film the user from a distance</a>, used often by skiers when skiing or in ground-controlled aerial photography. Bhattacharyya estimates these will cost between \u00a3700 ($1,000) and \u00a31,000 ($1,500).</p> <p> \u2022You can read our archive of The innovators columns <a href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/the-innovators-column\">on the Big Innovation Centre website</a> where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The fusing of the Bank of England\u2019s announcement of its decision on interest rates with the unveiling of its quarterly inflation report is a relatively new phenomenon. It has been dubbed \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d by economists who don\u2019t have much else to get excited about, and has been structured in this way to either (a) allow the Bank to \u201ctake a deeper look at inflation prospects and give it a fresh perspective on the monetary policy\u201d; or (b) because there\u2019s been so little to say about rates for seven years that the Bank\u2019s press office has got a bit embarrassed. Anyway, this Thursday will be one of the super ones when there will be no news on rates (they\u2019ll almost certainly stay at 0.5%) and maybe a bit on the Bank\u2019s guesses about inflation, after it was surprised by the size of the oil-price slump. Bank watchers will then embark on their main function: translating the words of governor Mark Carney into English as he talks around the inevitable questions on Brexit and negative interest rates, following Japan\u2019s move to -0.1% last week. That shift provoked many in the City to take a crash course on what negative interest rates actually mean, only for it all to end in disappointment. It turns out that you don\u2019t get paid for racking up more credit card debt. Even bankers aren\u2019t daft enough to allow that. Rivalry at the bank could get an airing Wednesday\u2019s Treasury select committee hearing is entitled \u201cThe economic and financial costs and benefits of the UK\u2019s EU membership\u201d. This is when Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, and Tracey McDermott, acting chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, will be giving their views.That may well not be something people will feel compelled to buy a ticket for, but hear us out: the subplot is intriguing. When Martin Wheatley was eased out of the FCA by George Osborne last summer, the top internal candidate was assumed to be McDermott. Those theories were dashed earlier this month when Osborne revealed on the radio that the acting chief didn\u2019t want the job, despite her having been through the recruitment process. The chancellor dropped another bombshell a fortnight later, when he announced that Bailey had got the gig. Ok, so it\u2019s not exactly Josh Lyman and CJ Cregg for the chief of staff gig in The West Wing, but it may be as close as we get in the City \u2013 especially as Andrew Tyrie, the committee\u2019s chairman, can rarely resist such opportunities to stir things up. Is evil genius status a spoof? Ernst Stavro Blofeld tried to bring down the world from a hideaway in Davos (before others copied him in real life). Dick Fuld supposedly tried the same on the global economy from Lehman Brothers\u2019 Manhattan HQ. And now Navinder Singh Sarao is accused of almost singlehandedly dismantling the world\u2019s financial markets from his lair in, er, a Hounslow semi. This may be mixing up fiction and (the odd) fact, but when individuals are accused of bringing down global systems, it\u2019s not always obvious which bits belong where. Which brings us to this week and Sarao, who will be back in court resisting efforts by the US to extradite him for allegedly \u201cspoofing\u201d financial markets with $200m of false trades. The court will, presumably, hear more evidence, but the PR case against the trader has always been framed by the Americans\u2019 early accusation that he contributed to the 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d, which caused the Dow Jones index to plunge 600 points in five minutes. Academics largely debunked the notion of the trader\u2019s culpability for that last week, which always seemed to implausibly cast Sarao as the most economically significant thing to come out of Hounslow since the A4. We will hear if the US legal case is more realistic from Thursday.",

It turns out that you don\u2019t get paid for racking up more credit card debt. Even bankers aren\u2019t daft enough to allow that.</p> <h2>Rivalry at the bank could get an airing<br></h2> <p>Wednesday\u2019s Treasury select committee hearing is entitled \u201cThe economic and financial costs and benefits of the UK\u2019s EU membership\u201d. This is when Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, and Tracey McDermott, acting chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, will be giving their views.That may well not be something people will feel compelled to buy a ticket for, but hear us out: the subplot is intriguing.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/17/city-watchdog-chief-quits-fca-george-osborne\" title=\"\">Martin Wheatley was eased out of the FCA by George Osborne </a>last summer, the top internal candidate was assumed to be McDermott. Those theories were dashed earlier this month when Osborne revealed on the radio that the acting chief didn\u2019t want the job, despite her having been through the recruitment process. The chancellor dropped another bombshell a fortnight later, when he announced that Bailey had got the gig.</p> <p>Ok, so it\u2019s not exactly Josh Lyman and CJ Cregg for the chief of staff gig in <em>The West Wing</em>, but it may be as close as we get in the City \u2013 especially as Andrew Tyrie, the committee\u2019s chairman, can rarely resist such opportunities to stir things up.</p> <h2>Is evil genius status a spoof?<br></h2> <p>Ernst Stavro Blofeld tried to bring down the world from a hideaway in Davos (before others copied him in real life). Dick Fuld supposedly tried the same on the global economy from Lehman Brothers\u2019 Manhattan HQ. And now Navinder Singh Sarao is accused of almost singlehandedly dismantling the world\u2019s financial markets from his lair in, er, a Hounslow semi.</p> <p>This may be mixing up fiction and (the odd) fact, but when individuals are accused of bringing down global systems, it\u2019s not always obvious which bits belong where.</p> <p>Which brings us to this week and Sarao, who will be back in court resisting efforts by the US to extradite him for allegedly \u201cspoofing\u201d financial markets with $200m of false trades.</p> <p>The court will, presumably, hear more evidence, but the PR case against the trader has always been framed by the Americans\u2019 early accusation that he contributed to the 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d, which caused the Dow Jones index to plunge 600 points in five minutes.</p> <p>Academics largely debunked the notion of the trader\u2019s culpability for that last week, which always seemed to implausibly cast Sarao as the most economically significant thing to come out of Hounslow since the A4. We will hear if the US legal case is more realistic from Thursday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018It is a commonplace observation that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\u201d So wrote C Northcote Parkinson in jest about postwar bureaucracy in 1955. But his musings resonated far and wide, and now, 60 years on, what became known as Parkinson\u2019s law is worth exploring in a country where productivity remains mired in the doldrums. What if solving the productivity puzzle is simply a case of fitting the same work into a shorter time? A marketing agency in Liverpool has been trying just that for the last two months. Its old 8.30am-5.30pm working day was swapped for 9am-4pm with a mandatory one-hour lunch break in the middle. What started as a week-long challenge set by the BBC\u2019s The One Show was extended throughout December and January. Now the experiment is over and Agent Marketing is weighing the costs and benefits of a six-hour day. It will not be introducing those hours on a permanent basis, says managing director Paul Corcoran. In an office where clients are accustomed to their calls being answered until 6pm, it just doesn\u2019t make business sense. But the trial has still shaken things up. The 14-strong workforce has cut daily meetings from one hour to 15 minutes and canned Friday\u2019s meeting altogether. Every employee will do a six-hour day at least once a week and on Friday everyone finishes at 4pm. Corcoran says hours will be down overall compared with pre-experiment days and productivity is up. The trailblazers for the six-hour day hail from Sweden, where a variety of companies have cut their working week to improve wellbeing and as a result have reported improvements in productivity and lower staff turnover. Evidence that shorter hours can boost output has been around much longer. A government decision to cut hours at munitions plants during the first world war made workers healthier and also more productive, according to research by John Pencavel, a professor of economics at Stanford University. He revisited data collected by the health of munition workers committee, set up by war minister David Lloyd George, to investigate the effect of long working hours on the factories\u2019 predominantly young female workers. The committee\u2019s recommendations included giving workers at least one full day off each week. It was a smart move, says Pencavel, writing in the December 2015 issue of the Economic Journal. He calculates that the week\u2019s output was slightly higher when the munition workers worked 48 hours over six days, compared with 70 hours over seven days. In more recent times, there are signs the staff at Agent Marketing are not alone in working a shorter week. The Bank of England is among those highlighting the fact that the average number of hours worked per week has been falling in the UK. Many employers cut hours to match slower demand rather than lay off workers altogether during the recession. Britain\u2019s working week then lengthened again, but recently that improvement has stalled. BoE policymaker Kristin Forbes noted in a recent speech that people are working fewer hours on average than they were before the crisis. She believes much of this reflects a choice by workers. Her colleague on the monetary policy committee, Martin Weale, makes a link to demographics. For example, there are now more older people in the workforce who do not want to retire, but nor do they want to work full-time. Weale takes the long view and points out that a typical week for a full-time worker is now just under 40 hours, compared with more than 60 in 1860. It\u2019s comforting to think that despite fears that machines will take our jobs, what might actually happen is that they take some of our workload but leave us our livelihoods, as well as more leisure time. But why then, if we are working fewer hours than our grandparents and parents, do surveys paint a picture of British workers feeling exhausted and overloaded? A report last week from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) found many employees feel under \u201cexcessive pressure\u201d, with \u201cfar too many people doing more work than they can cope with\u201d. It decried a \u201cwellbeing vacuum\u201d in UK workplaces which was costing employers dear in absenteeism. An earlier CIPD report made the case that if employees felt they were working harder, it was not because they were working longer hours; rather, the reason was that work was more demanding and intense. In other words, in a world where customers and employers want everything yesterday, deadlines can become overwhelming for workers. Technology must take some of the blame here too \u2013 smartphones have radically changed expectations when it comes to response times. Another factor will be all too familiar to many workers who held on to their jobs during the last downturn. Hours, and sometimes headcount, were cut when demand fell. But now demand is recovering and the same workers are burdened with more tasks. Sadly, there is plenty of evidence that so far Britain has gone for short and angry when it comes to trimming hours, rather than short and sweet. If employers want more out of workers, they must invest in better training and better equipment. They need more reasonable expectations. In short, British workplace culture needs some big shifts to make the curtailed week more than a Scandinavian pipe dream. And shift it should. As the productivity puzzle persists, a shorter day and the shake-up that entails \u2013 from fewer meetings to less tweeting \u2013 is certainly one of many possible fixes worth trying out. Less really can be more. Just ask Lloyd George.",
