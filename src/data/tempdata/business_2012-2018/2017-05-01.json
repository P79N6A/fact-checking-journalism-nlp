      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green and his wife are among the UK\u2019s richest couples \u2013 although their wealth has fallen by \u00a3433m over the past year following the collapse of BHS, according to an annual wealth ranking. The couple came fifth in the husbands and wives section of the latest Sunday Times Rich List, which ranks the 1,000 richest people in Britain and will be published in full on Sunday. The Greens were the only couple on the list whose wealth dropped over the past year, to \u00a32.8bn. BHS, the department store chain formerly owned by Green, plunged into administration just more than a year ago, affecting 11,000 jobs and around 19,000 pension holders. After a long public row, Green, also boss of retail empire Arcadia, agreed to pay \u00a3363m to rescue the BHS pension scheme in February. But the billionaire has been warned that he could still be stripped of his knighthood. The value of Green\u2019s Arcadia stake has also dropped because of falling sales, reduced assets and a ballooning pension deficit. Ernesto and Kirsty Bertarelli are the UK\u2019s richest couple, with a combined wealth of \u00a311.5bn, and ranked sixth on the Sunday Times general list. Their fortune stems from the sale of the family biotech firm, Serono, and the soaring value of their stake in another pharma business, Santhera. The couple own the largest superyacht built in the UK \u2013 named Vava II, a birthday present for Kirsty from Ernesto, who is a double winner of the America\u2019s Cup. Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, the daughter of late Heineken boss Freddy Heineken, and her banker husband Michel de Carvalho came second on the husband and wife list, with their wealth estimated at \u00a39.3bn. De Carvalho-Heineken has a stake in the Dutch brewing company valued at nearly \u00a38.5bn. They are more than twice as rich as Alejandro Santo Domingo and Charlotte Wellesley, who made their debut in the rich list as the third richest couple, with a fortune of \u00a33.9bn. The 40-year-old scion of Colombia\u2019s richest family, which holds a big stake in the giant US beer company Anheuser-Busch, married Wellesley, the 26-year-old daughter of the Duke of Wellington, last May. In fourth place, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault and Salma Hayek, are worth \u00a33.4bn. Pinault runs the luxury fashion group Kering whose brands include Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen. The Mexican-born actress Hayek is set to appear in four films this year and earns about \u00a312m a year from her work. The 10 richest husbands and wives in the UK are worth nearly \u00a340bn in total and have seen their fortune increase by a combined \u00a33.4bn in the past 12 months. Robert Watts, compiler of the Sunday Times Rich List 2017, said this year\u2019s wealth ranking \u201cwill show how the makeup of Britain\u2019s richest 1,000 people is changing \u2013 with a record number of women and more husband and wife partnerships than before\u201d. \u201cStarting a business with your other half may not appeal to everyone. A bit of pillow talk about balance sheets wouldn\u2019t suit all marriages, but there are clearly some couples who are making it work \u2013 and very well.\u201d He added: \u201cThe growing number of women we\u2019re seeing in the Rich List is part of a greater diversity, with more people from ethnic backgrounds and more surprising walks of life, with soft-toy makers and dating-app developers lining up with private-equity barons and hedge-fund managers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Reading the budget papers always involves trying to focus on both the wood and the trees \u2013 seeing the big numbers and also the individual impacts. Next week\u2019s budget looks to be one where more than ever the treasurer wants people to focus on the wood \u2013 and his new definition of what the wood is \u2013 which means more than ever we\u2019ll need to pay attention to the trees. Budgets involve an absolute mass and mess of numbers, and it\u2019s easy to get lost. I usually first read the economic tables to check the assumptions that drive the budget projections and then go from there to tables in the appendix. As a rule I treat the \u201cbudget overview\u201d with scant regard, as it is often just a political sales pitch. But in Joe Hockey\u2019s first budget, the overview (and nowhere else) contained the line that the government would cut spending to the states for education and health in order to \u201cachieve cumulative savings of over $80 bn by 2024\u201125.\u201d The overview is also where in past budgets the table outlining the impacts on various household types was listed \u2013 something that has been absent in the past three budgets. So there is a lot to look for \u2013 not only what is included but also what is left out. This year the new wrinkle will be to see how debt is treated \u2013 both in a government-wide sense and at a portfolio level. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, also appears to be placing a greater focus on a measure called the \u201cnet operating balance\u201d. Now treasurers often try to get the media and voters to focus on measures that tell the best story. Some treasurers even make up their own measure. Joe Hockey hated that because revenue collapsed during the GFC, the Rudd-Gillard governments were lower taxers than the Howard government. He argued that those ALP governments were really big-taxing governments because you also had to include the budget deficit when considering the amount of money the government took out of the economy. So he had the Treasury come up with a measure named the \u201ccall on resources\u201d, which added revenue and the headline cash balance together. It was, shall we say, stupid. It\u2019s the type of measure that only makes sense if you think governments should cut spending when revenue collapses (otherwise known as the \u201cYes I would like a deep recession\u201d strategy). No one gave it any heed, and it also failed to make his political argument, because the measure showed that the \u201ccall on resources\u201d was actually bigger under the Abbott government than the Rudd-Gillard governments: When Morrison took over as treasurer, he dumped it. Morrison\u2019s new favourite measure, the net operating balance, is at least not made up \u2013 it is a standard figure that is in all budget papers but it gets little attention. In essence the net operating balance is the \u201cfiscal balance\u201d minus net capital investment. The fiscal balance is not the same as the \u201cunderlying cash balance\u201d (which is the balance we talk about when we talk about a budget deficit or surplus), as it is an accrual measure while the cash balance is (oddly enough) a cash measure. And that right there might be the most boring paragraph I\u2019ve ever written. I hope you all stayed awake. So what do we really need to know? Why is Morrison focussing on this measure? Basically Morrison likes the net operating balance because it does not include capital spending outlays and thus focuses more on recurrent spending. As a result, the net operating deficit is usually smaller than the standard \u201cbudget deficit\u201d. The two, however, move largely in line with each other, but the gap has widened a bit recently. Last December\u2019s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook projected the net operating deficit in 2019-20 to be just $1.3bn, compared with the budget deficit of $9.99bn: The reason for the difference is the increase in projected capital spending \u2013 i.e., spending on infrastructure: By 2019-20 capital investment is currently projected to reach around 0.3% of GDP \u2013 the highest since the tail-end of the GFC stimulus in 2011-12. The suspicion is that next week\u2019s budget will contain even more investment spending. Such spending would increase the budget deficit, but it would not affect the net operating balance. So clearly, for a treasurer of a government that has long talked about the horrors of debt and deficit, it\u2019s not surprising that Morrison would have us focus on the smaller number \u2013 especially as our debt levels are now well above where they were three years ago: But to what end is this infrastructure spending? The one budget figure that I like to focus on (journalists, like politicians, have their favourite measures) is the projected growth of demand: Demand in the economy has been incredibly weak in the past few years, and government demand \u2013 especially in 2014-15 \u2013 has done little to help. It will be interesting to see if Morrison\u2019s budget will take a very active approach towards firing up the economy, or if for all his talk about infrastructure, there appears little immediate impact on the economy. But we need to always remember that a budget balance \u2013 whether underlying cash or net operating \u2013 is not an end in itself. Do we wish for a net operating surplus if it comes via cuts to education or health spending, or because the indexation on pensions is reduced, or because students will have to pay more for their degrees? Cutting taxes on those earning over $180,000 and cutting welfare spending affects the net operating balance as much as it does the standard budget balance. Chasing a surplus of one measure is not inherently more sensible than the other \u2013 especially if the method used to achieve that surplus involves policy that would increase inequality. It\u2019s why focussing on the \u201cwood\u201d in a budget is all well and good, but the \u201ctrees\u201d matter a great deal.",

Such spending would increase the budget deficit, but it would not affect the net operating balance. </p> <p>So clearly, for a treasurer of a government that has long talked about the horrors of debt and deficit, it\u2019s not surprising that Morrison would have us focus on the smaller number \u2013 especially as our debt levels are now well above where they were three years ago:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Commonwealth government debt\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZhmcI/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But to what end is this infrastructure spending?</p> <p>The one budget figure that I like to focus on (journalists, like politicians, have their favourite measures) is the projected growth of demand:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of demand\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3hkca/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Demand in the economy has been incredibly weak in the past few years, and government demand \u2013 especially in 2014-15 \u2013 has done little to help. It will be interesting to see if Morrison\u2019s budget will take a very active approach towards firing up the economy, or if for all his talk about infrastructure, there appears little immediate impact on the economy. </p> <p>But we need to always remember that a budget balance \u2013 whether underlying cash or net operating \u2013 is not an end in itself. </p> <p>Do we wish for a net operating surplus if it comes via cuts to education or health spending, or because the indexation on pensions is reduced, or because students will have to pay more for their degrees? </p> <p>Cutting taxes on those earning over $180,000 and cutting welfare spending affects the net operating balance as much as it does the standard budget balance. </p> <p>Chasing a surplus of one measure is not inherently more sensible than the other \u2013 especially if the method used to achieve that surplus involves policy that would increase inequality. </p> <p>It\u2019s why focussing on the \u201cwood\u201d in a budget is all well and good, but the \u201ctrees\u201d matter a great deal. </p>",

      "bodyText": "A state-owned Swedish company has become the latest European firm to enter the UK\u2019s lucrative energy market, as Britain\u2019s appeal to continental power suppliers shows no sign of abating after the Brexit vote. Vattenfall, which is 100% controlled by the Swedish government, is launching its first foray into UK energy supply as it joins a competitive field of European players including France\u2019s EDF, German-owned E.ON and Npower, and Spanish-backed Scottish Power. Vattenfall has already made inroads in the UK by building several windfarms, including a North Sea project near Aberdeen and Wales\u2019 largest onshore windfarm which is due to complete next year. Now, in what Vattenfall has described as a vote of confidence in post-referendum Britain, the firm will sell its renewable power from the windfarms direct to big business customers. \u201cLong term we don\u2019t see that this [Brexit] as changing the basic prerequisite for doing business together. We find the UK to be an attractive market for us now and going forward, and we will continue to invest in the market,\u201d said Vattenfall executive Anna Borg. Vattenfall follows established European players such as EDF and E.ON but also Danish state-owned Dong Energy, which sells its wind power to corporate clients, and Dutch firm Eneco, which supplies business customers such as Heineken and Unilever. France\u2019s Engie is also attempting to muscle in on the consumer market and trying to woo households with a tariff that tracks wholesale power prices. . Borg said European power companies are attracted to the UK market because of two fundamentals: tight margins between energy supply and demand which means a constant appetite for new entrants; and the UK\u2019s legally enshrined climate targets, which will remain when the UK leaves the EU and ensure demand for energy generated by renewables or nuclear. The combination, she said, means the government will support investment in new plants and will require energy from low-carbon entrants. Vattenfall believes its portfolio of renewable power and the confidence instilled by dealing with an established player will help it win over corporate customers wanting to burnish their green credentials. Borg said Vattenfall is a state-owned company which has been around for 100 years and is here to stay. Vattenfall\u2019s decision to sell its German coal business last year to focus on green energy also showed it was capable of transforming, Borg added. While Vattenfall is not yet naming its first customers, it said it was in talks with UK retailers, manufacturing industries and data centre operators. Borg would not be drawn on whether the Swedish firm was considering making a play for the consumer market, which is dominated by six big energy suppliers, four of which are owned by European energy companies. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say. We will see what opportunities arise,\u201d she said. However, the prospect of price caps being imposed on household energy bills, as promised by Theresa May\u2019s Conservative party, would not deter Vattenfall. \u201cIn general of course, price regulation is complicated and difficult in a market that is supposed to be deregulated. But we are used to managing a lot of regulatory issues in all the market we operate in, so it doesn\u2019t change our willingness,\u201d said Borg. Vattenfall has invested \u00a33bn in the UK since 2008, and from next year will operate around 1GW of wind power, enough to power 650,000 homes. Experts said the company\u2019s established standing would place it in a strong position. Robert Buckley, an analyst at Cornwall Energy, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a big strategic move for them but they are following a well-trodden path. There is a demand out there from the business supply market for the kind of product that they have to sell.\u201d The fact the power was generated by windfarms would help too, he added. \u201cThe green side is attractive to some. Some companies have very strong corporate social responsibility objectives.\u201d Cornwall said Vattenfall is the 50th business-to-business energy supplier in the UK.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There is \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d infrastructure as well as good and bad debt, Scott Morrison has said, in a further evolution of the government\u2019s narrative on spending. The treasurer made the comments on ABC radio on Monday to disavow the idea that debt to pay for infrastructure would be used for unproductive \u201cpork-barrelling\u201d projects. Last week Morrison said the government would change the way debt was accounted for in the budget, to separate \u201cgood debt\u201d from \u201cbad debt\u201d. The move was signposted in December and marks a radical shift from rhetoric in which senior Coalition figures have compared debt to cancer and a house on fire. On Monday Morrison said the first dollars of government revenue should go to recurring expenses such as schools, hospitals and Medicare, but when money was borrowed it should go \u201ctowards projects which have a much longer timeframe for delivering [a] benefit\u201d. \u201cInfrastructure is one of the most important things you can do for your national productivity.\u201d When the interviewer, Sabra Lane, noted that not all infrastructure made a good return for the public, Morrison agreed, saying \u201cthat\u2019s true\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s good infrastructure and bad infrastructure, there\u2019s no doubt about that as well,\u201d he said. Morrison said cost benefit analyses and the work of Infrastructure Australia were important in choosing the right projects. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to focus on the projects that give you the bang for the taxpayers\u2019 buck, but, most of all, that grows the economy, which grows wages, which puts more in people\u2019s pockets and reduces ultimately the cost pressures on their cost of living.\u201d Labor\u2019s infrastructure spokesman, Anthony Albanese, has raised concerns that the government is sidelining Infrastructure Australia with the creation of a separate infrastructure financing unit in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. On Friday Albanese told Lateline that the government should invest in public transport projects including the cross-river rail in Brisbane and the Melbourne metro. \u201cI have been arguing for a long period of time about productive infrastructure being an investment, not a cost,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it has got to be for the right projects.\u201d He called for objectivity in the selection of projects. Asked if the government would return the budget to surplus in 2020-21, Morrison said projections would be updated in next week\u2019s budget. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that we continue to keep control over our current expenditure and that, at the same time, we do things that drive the economy forward,\u201d he said. On Monday Deloitte Access Economics projected the budget deficit for the 2016-17 financial year was likely to be $38.3bn, nearly $2bn worse than projected five months ago. At a doorstop in Canberra, Morrison refused to comment on the projection but said the budget was about \u201cmaking the right choices to support the Australian economy\u201d including to pay for services and so that businesses can \u201csupport their incomes\u201d. Asked if the government would dump unlegislated \u201czombie measures\u201d that had been blocked by the Senate, Morrison said the government had passed $25bn in savings since the last budget, about two-thirds of those it was seeking. He said ratings agencies had kept Australia\u2019s credit rating at triple-A in recognition of the fact the government \u201chad been making substantial progress on our savings task\u201d. \u201cGoing forward into this budget, it is important the budget is a credible document, a practical document, it\u2019s a document that can be put forward with confidence to the Australian parliament for support.\u201d Asked if universities could be more efficient, after reports the government would cut their funding with an \u201cefficiency dividend\u201d, Morrison said there was \u201ccapacity for the sector to deliver better value\u201d because government funding had increased faster than per-student costs.",
