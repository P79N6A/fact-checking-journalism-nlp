      "bodyText": "In an uncertain day ahead of a busy week, the Spanish stock market bucked the trend and jumped sharply on hopes that the Catalan independence crisis could be resolved. A positive set of GDP numbers for the country also helped sentiment. Elswhere the FTSE 100 slipped lower, as its overseas earners reacted badly to a stronger pound, which moved higher ahead of this week\u2019s Bank of England meeting where the first interest rise in a decade is widely expected. On Wall Street the latest developments in the investigation into possible Russian interference in the US election saw markets slip back. There was also talk that President Trump\u2019s long awaited tax reforms may only be gradual. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 17.22 points or 0.23% at 7487.81 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.09% to 13,229.57 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.01% lower at 5493.63 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.39% to 22,752.89 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 2.44% at 10,446.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.59% to 743.57 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 63 points or 0.27%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 continue to suffer, not helped by talk that the much anticipated Trump tax reforms could now only be gradual. So the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are both down around 0.3%. But the Nasdaq Composite has slipped just 0.1% as investors still like the look of technology stocks in the wake of last week\u2019s bumper results. Apple and Facebook, which both give updates this week, are both in demand. The pound has moved higher ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s latest meeting this week, with the first interest rate rise for a decade widely expected. Sterling is currently up 0.49% against the dollar at $1.3190 and 0.32% higher against the euro at \u20ac1.1341. The strength of the pound has however knocked 0.25% off the FTSE 100, dominated as it is by overseas earners who benefit from a weaker UK currency. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling continued to strengthen on Monday, as investors spent a relatively quiet afternoon eyeing Thursday\u2019s Bank of England rate vote...Though an interest rate rise on Thursday is far from certain, today\u2019s trading seems to suggest investors think we might be in for the first hike in a decade. A UK rate rise is widely deemed to be good for the country\u2019s banks but Peter Thorne, senior financial analyst at Charles Stanley, is not convinced: Rock-bottom interest rates have been terrible for UK banks\u2019 profitability, but any interest rate rise ...could actually be a double-edged sword. Higher interest rates will boost UK banks\u2019 net interest income but the equity market is increasingly concerned about the slowdown in the UK economy and the negative effects it could have on loan growth and bad debt charges which a rate rise might worsen. Back with the UK public finances, and Labour MP Stella Creasy has found a tax loophole she believes could bring in some \u00a38bn to the public purse. She writes: There is a country that taxes British residents, and British companies, when they make money on selling commercial real estate, but doesn\u2019t tax foreigners. That country is the UK. Closing the tax loophole around non-UK companies and commercial property sales would level the playing field for British businesses and at the same time help tackle the overheated housing market. It would also generate substantial revenue \u2013 enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example. According to the British Property Federation there is about \u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate in the UK \u2013 10% of our nation\u2019s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u2013 worth an eye-watering \u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs. When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u2013 including most high value property \u2013 is held through offshore companies. Typically these companies are in tax havens, or structured so they pay no tax on the capital gain. Indeed, British taxpayers should be asking tough questions as to why their government turns a blind eye to anyone who holds UK property in offshore companies. Her full analysis is here: Here are some of the comments from the Dallas manufacturing survey: Chemical Manufacturing Our input for October is impacted by hurricane effects on the Gulf Coast\u2014month/month improvements were driven by industrial shutdowns and a prolonged recovery effort. We are having huge problems getting raw materials following Hurricane Harvey. We could not get deliveries due to a lack of drivers when the material was available. These problems are continuing. Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing The shutdowns and damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser extent Hurricane Irma have caused refinery operators to reschedule a lot of their planned work into 2018. This delay is having an increased effect on pricing pressure for what work is available, and the small amount of project work is almost entirely being sourced offshore. We are planning on an extended period of extremely poor market conditions and are adjusting our capacity accordingly. Our facilities were severely flooded in Hurricane Harvey, so we had little production in September and are still in the process of repairing major production equipment. The global economies and the U.S. economy are very weak and uncertain\u2014poor environment, business, etc. We saw a lull in orders in the third quarter and some into the fourth due to hurricane activity along the Southwest and Southeast. However, this short-term lull is due only to weather and will pick up in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2018. Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing Public infrastructure spending drives the revenue cycle for our business. We need a long-term federal highway bill. We are seeing the effects of Hurricane Harvey on the activities of our customers. Machinery Manufacturing We remain optimistic about the future, although things have slowed down significantly. Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing The world economy and high dollar have been a problem for our customers in the capital equipment industry. Electrical Equipment, Appliance and Component Manufacturing Things are generally good\u2014not great. Hurricanes slowed down September and October, which are usually two of our best months. Competitors are pricing erratically, which is hurting profits. Printing and Related Support Activities The rebound from Hurricane Harvey\u2019s impact on Houston business is still dragging. Some clients did not make it through and closed. Insurance companies are dragging out compensation on claims and slowing the recovery. Our mail volume from hundreds of customers is still down, and we are hoping that they will finally get their businesses repaired and begin to market their services again because the holiday season is upon us, and everyone knows they have to make it now or things will implode. We keep waiting for it to get busier, although we are very busy now, which is normal for this time of year. I see November and December possibly being slower than normal, which is concerning as we use the fat from these months to carry us through the lean winter months. Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing October is looking better than September, which was weak. The two months will probably net out to about flat compared with the prior year. We have at least made up our first-half decline and are now up 0.2 percent year to date. This is a slight improvement from the 1 to 2 percent annual declines we have experienced the last few years. Apparel Manufacturing Military apparel sewing projects are anticipated to increase significantly. Paper Manufacturing September and October were good months. More positive economic data from the US, more fuel to the flames as far as a December rate hike is concerned. The Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing index of general business activity came in at 27.6 in October, much higher than the expected 21 and September\u2019s figure of 21.3. The manufacturing output index rose from 19.5 in September to 25.6. US markets have eased back from their record breaking run last week, which was partly fuelled by a surge in technology shares after forecast-beating results from the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. As well as some profit taking, investors are playing it cautiously ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting this week - which is not expected to alter interest rates but could point to a rise in December - and crucially, Donald Trump\u2019s decision as to who he will pick for the next Fed chair. On top of that, traders are also trying to weigh up the latest developments in the enquiry into possible Russian interference in the US election. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 37 points or 0.16%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened a few points lower. Over in Europe, and the Spanish market has jumped 2.4%, recovering all of Friday\u2019s losses and more despite the continuing dispute over Catalonian independence. Some concerns were eased a little after a weekend poll suggested secessionists may lose their majority in elections scheduled for December. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The Spanish government has dissolved the parliament in Catalonia, and has announced a snap election in December. According to the opinion poll that was published in El Mundo, the Catalan separatists might lose their majority in the region. On top of that, came some positive Spanish GDP figures as we reported earlier. So all in all, the MSCI world equity index hit yet another new peak, up 0.2%. The IFS\u2019s warning that Britain\u2019s fiscal position is worse than forecast has cast some autumnal gloom over the economy. And with Halloween looming, Anthony Doyle, fixed interest investment director at M&amp;G, has send over some more spooky charts to give us the shivers. This one shows how the G20 advanced economies now owe $135 trillion US dollars, or 260% of their annual economic outlook. As Doyle says: Governments, corporates, and households have never lived beyond their means by so much. This chart shows how the European Central Bank\u2019s huge asset purchase scheme has driven down the interest rate on eurozone government debt. So, what happens when the ECB stops buying?.... With interest rates so low, and central banks so active in the market, investors have been forced to buy riskier assets in search of a decent return. So if the markets turn south and investors \u201chead for the exits\u201d, there could be \u201csubstantial price declines\u201d if everyone tries to sell these assets at the same time. After decades of weakened unions, workers now face poor wage growth and limited job protection. Indeed, the situation is so bad that central bankers are now calling for wage increases. Doyle says: For the first time, central bankers like Mario Draghi and Haruhiko Kuroda have been calling on unions to increase wage demands, with Draghi stating wages are the \u201cprimary driver of inflation\u201d..... Unless workers can start demanding higher rates of pay, it is likely they will continue to suffer real-wage declines. This has been the case in the UK, with unit labour costs and inflation growing by 16% and 25% respectively since 2008.\u201d And finally, a chart showing why \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 could be scarier than the costumed children who\u2019ll be knocking on our doors tomorrow night: Doyle explains: \u201cIn March 2019, unless some form of deal is agreed, the UK will have to negotiate trade deals with the majority of its current trading partners. This would be a major challenge as complex trade agreements are not easy to negotiate and often take years to agree to. If the UK finds itself outside the European Union Single market and the EU Customs Union, tariff and non-tariff trade barriers (like quotas, embargoes, and levies) are likely to be implemented between the UK and its main European trading partners. Some sectors and companies may face much more restricted access to the European market, and that will prove to be a significant headwind to UK economic growth in the short-term.\u201d Just in: The cost of living in Germany rose by less than expected this month. Germany\u2019s harmonised consumer prices index rose by 1.5% per year in October, a smaller rise than expected. The European Central Bank will see this as vindication for its strategy of keeping interest rates at record lows (even though it\u2019s very unpopular with German savers). Newsflash from America: US consumer spending has surged at its fastest rate since the early days of the financial crisis. Consumer spending jumped by 1% in August, a very sharp increase. It may be driven by people replacing furniture and automobiles damaged by the hurricane season. This is the biggest jump since summer 2009, when US launched a \u2018cash for clunkers\u2019 scrappage scheme to encourage people to buy new cars. Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, has a new hobby -- baiting the UK government over its Brexit strategy. Blankein has just tweeted a photo of Goldman\u2019s new European headquarters, currently being built in the City of London. Jolly impressive it looks too.... but Blankein hints that Goldman might not fill the site, if it is forced to relocate staff overseas because of Brexit. This is Blankfein\u2019s second pointed tweet of the month. Two weeks ago, he couldn\u2019t resist telling his 66,000 followers how much he loves Germany\u2019s financial capital, Frankfurt. For balance, we should note that the weather in London is rather splendid today.... Over in the City, sterling has risen this morning despite the IFS\u2019s gloomy prognosis. The pound has gained over half a cent against the US dollar to $1.318, largely driven by expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% on Thursday. It could be a split decision; some BoE policymakers, including deputy governor Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden, have sounded a little nervous about a rate hike recently. But the BoE, led by governor Mark Carney, has dropped a lot of hints that a rate hike is coming.... so it would be real shock if it doesn\u2019t happen. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg explains: When it comes to monetary policy, talk matters almost as much as action. Now that the market is ready and waiting for a hike this week, the BoE would risk a major hit to its credibility if it did not meet this expectation. In short, if the BoE didn\u2019t intend to hike it probably would have told us by now. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s the key message from the IFS today : As you can see, Britain is probably going to have to borrow more than expected over the next few years, and a lot more if the Office for Budget Responsibility concludes that UK productivity growth will remain \u2018very weak\u2019 in the next few years. Back in London, the Institute of Fiscal Studies is briefing experts about its new assessment of the UK economy, ahead of next month\u2019s budget. Helen Miller, the head of tax research at the IFS, is tweeting some key charts. They show how Philip Hammond is in a real fix if, as seems likely, Britain\u2019s weak productivity growth drives up Britain\u2019s deficit by \u00a320bn by 2020-21. This one, for example, highlights how health spending has been pretty modest since the financial crisis, once you adjust for population changes. This chart shows how government is already planning further public spending cuts over this parliament..... ....while Britain\u2019s environment department has suffered the biggest spending cuts since 2010. The Justice department has also been squeezed - and there are now signs that this is causing real damage: But where could Hammond raise money from? He could increase national insurance, or abandon cuts to corporation tax. But would the House of Commons approve?.... Breaking: Economic confidence across the eurozone has hit its highest level in around 16 years. Following Spain\u2019s decent growth figures this morning, it\u2019s fresh evidence that 2017 is turning into a vintage year for the eurozone. The lack of a debt crisis is helping the region to catch up with Britain, just as the UK economy slows.... Newsflash: British consumers are still racking up bills on their credit cards. New figures from the Bank of England shows that borrowing via credit cards jumped by by 9.3% year-on-year last month. Britons now owe \u00a369.4bn on their credit cards, up from \u00a369.0bn in August. This may be a sign that rising inflation, and falling real wages, is forcing more people to borrow to make ends meet. In total, all consumer credit grew by almost 10% per year since June, dipping slightly in September to 9.9%. The Bank of England also reports that the number of mortgage approvals fell by exactly 1,000 last month to 66,232. That\u2019s close to the recent average, but may show a cooling in demand... Here\u2019s another neat chart from the IFS, showing how chancellors like to hit the public with tax rises shortly after a general election (perhaps hoping that we\u2019ll have forgotten by the time we vote again) But, as Paul Johnson warned on the Today programme.... parliament isn\u2019t in the mood to raise taxes. The BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed points out that the new budget black hole might be bigger than \u00a320bn (as explained at 7.57am, it all depends on productivity...) Here\u2019s another stunning fact from the IFS: Britain\u2019s economy would be 15% bigger, even adjusted for population increases, if it had continued to grow at its pre-crisis pace since 2008. Instead, the economy didn\u2019t really bounce back from its very sharp downturn after the financial crisis. Apologies, we had a technical glitch with the comments this morning (OK, I might have forgotten to press the \u2018On\u2019 button). They\u2019re turned on now..... The Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 report is online here. It concludes with a grim assessment of the challenge facing \u2018Spreadsheet Phil\u2019 Hammond: The first Budget of a new parliament is often the best chance a Chancellor has to set out her stall. She can raise taxes if need be, set an agenda for the next five years, and set in train economic and fiscal reforms. Mr Hammond, though, has been dealt a very tricky hand indeed. The political arithmetic makes any significant tax increase look very hard to deliver. It looks like he will face a substantial deterioration in the projected state of the public finances. He will know that seven years of \u201causterity\u201d have left many public services in a fragile state. And, in the known unknowns surrounding both the shape and impact of Brexit, he faces even greater than usual levels of economic uncertainty.... Which is why the chancellor may decide to ditch his goal of balancing the books by the mid 2020s... Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable tweets: And... here\u2019s why the government\u2019s deficit reduction strategy has spluttered. Today\u2019s report also shows that seven years of austerity have only brought Britain\u2019s tax receipts and government spending back to its levels before the financial crisis: The IFS says: As national income fell between 2007\u201308 and 2009\u201310, public spending increased sharply as a share of national income while government revenues fell. Since then, most of the increase in spending has been unwound, such that it in 2017\u201318 it was 0.5% of national income greater than it was in 2007\u201308 (6.1% less 5.6%). This is an important fact. Seven years of cuts have served merely to return public spending to its pre-crisis level as a share of national income. Total government receipts have risen by more as a share of national income since 2009\u201310 than they fell over the preceding two years, such that they are now 0.4% of national income greater than in 2007\u201308 (\u20131.1% plus 1.4%; numbers do not sum due to rounding). So overall borrowing is now only slightly greater than it was in 2007\u201308, with both receipts and spending slightly above their pre-crisis shares of national income. Labour MP Jack Dromey isn\u2019t impressed.... Every weekday morning, Business Today will deliver the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics, direct to your inbox.

You can sign up here. Q: Could the government really raise taxes specifically to get more funding for social care and the NHS, as Oliver Letwin says? IFS director Paul Johnson says it can be done in theory -- a chancellor can put a penny on income tax and say they\u2019ll spend it on the NHS. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you actually change NHS spending as the revenues from that new \u2018hypothecated\u2019 tax rise and fall, Johnson warns, adding: It\u2019s just a tax rise to increase spending. Letwin rebuts this. He argues that there could be legal safeguards that a new tax would be definitely be used on social care and the NHS. And that would be acceptable to the public, he says. Labour\u2019s Peter Dowd also criticises the idea. He says that after five or 10 years you can\u2019t tell how money is going into spending because of hypothecation, and how much because of general taxation. It also becomes harder to decide how to spend the hypothecated tax revenues, as demands and priorities changes. If you invest in productivity improvements, then eventually you don\u2019t need \u201chypothecation and whizzes and wheezes\u201d, Dowd declares. Peter Dowd, Labour\u2019s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, is also on the Today programme. Dowd argues that Britain needs more medium and long-term investment in the UK economy, to boost productivity. Labour\u2019s economic plan also includes raising taxes, but only for the top 5%, he adds. Sir Oliver Letwin, a Conservative MP, says he believes the IFS is roughly right. He believes that the UK should continue to aim for a balanced budget, as the medium-term risks facing the economy are considerable. Letwin argues that there is a case for raising taxes, if the receipts were used to spend more on social care and the NHS. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is discussing the IFS\u2019s report on the Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme right now. Johnson explains that Hammond needs to reduce spending or raise taxes if he\u2019s serious about hitting his fiscal targets. But the pressure is on him to do the opposite and rise spending - by eliminating the public sector pay cap, for example, or reversing cuts to benefits. There\u2019s also no appetite among MPs for tax rises. But if he raises spending without raising taxes, he\u2019s not sticking to his own fiscal targets. Q: But Hammond could borrow more.... interest rates are very low. Johnson points out that the UK\u2019s borrowing costs have been low for many years - Hammond and George Osborne didn\u2019t taken much advantage before. Raises borrowing also means the UK has to repay more eventually. Hammond could borrow more, but if he does then he\u2019s \u2018junking\u2019 his own fiscal goals. Q: So what would you do if you were the chancellor? I\u2019m very glad I\u2019m not, Johnson replies. There is a case for raising taxes a bit, and raising spending a bit more, but it\u2019s not feasible to raise taxes right now. In the end, Johnson concludes, Hammond may have to say he\u2019s not fixated on getting the deficit eliminated by 2025. That would give him some flexibility to take some risks (and potentially borrow more). Newsflash from Madrid: Spain\u2019s GDP expanded by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u2019s a solid result, and means Spanish economy grew twice as fast as Britain in the last quarter. The IFS\u2019s gloomy forecast suggest Britain may struggle to balance the books by the middle of the next decade, warns the Financial Times. As the FT\u2019s Gemma Tetlow puts it: When he took the job last year, the chancellor set himself the target of reducing public borrowing to less than 2 per cent of national income by 2020-21 and eliminating borrowing altogether by the mid-2020s. The commitment to strict fiscal discipline was seen as one of the important dividing lines between the Conservative party and Labour in this year\u2019s general election. But Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, said on Monday: \u201cGiven all the current pressures and uncertainties \u2014 and the policy action that these might require \u2014 it is perhaps time to admit that a firm commitment to running a budget surplus from the mid-2020s onwards is no longer sensible.\u201d The BBC agrees that Hammond faces a tough balancing act in next month\u2019s Budget. The IFS says Mr Hammond is also under \u201cincreasingly intense\u201d political pressure to spend more, while the Parliamentary arithmetic makes tax increases look difficult. The chancellor has been dealt a \u201cvery tricky hand indeed\u201d, it says. \u201cDoes he allow higher borrowing to persist, does he add to that with more spending, or does he try to offset that with greater taxes?\u201d said IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson. \u201cPublic sector workers, the NHS, the prison service, schools and working-age benefit recipients, among others, would like more money. City AM\u2019s Jasper Jolly points out that Hammond could tackle his deficit problems by hiking taxes - although this would be unpopular.... The Budget on 22 November may also include new revenue-raising measures. One option floated by the Treasury is a clampdown on companies using self-employed contractors, rather than employees, to avoid paying national insurance. Such a move could affect firms ranging from multinational behemoths like BP to tiny businesses with three employees, according to Jonathan Riley, head of tax at accountants Grant Thornton, as well as hitting professionals who are paid through personal service companies. These charts how how Britain\u2019s budget deficit could be billions of pounds bigger than was forecast, back in March: It all depends how severely the Office for Budget Responsibility downgrades its forecasts for Britain\u2019s productivity. The \u00a320bn deficit black hole is based on a moderate downgrade, to \u2018weak\u2019 productivity - which seems very plausible, given this year\u2019s economic data. But the OBR may conclude that productivity improvements will be \u2018very poor\u2019, at the recent rate of just 0.4% per year. If that happens, the deficit could still be \u00a370bn by 2021-22 -- not the \u00a317bn previously forecast. As the IFS puts it: If the OBR were to decide that the terrible productivity growth of the last seven years were now the new normal (the \u2018very poor\u2019 scenario, under which output per hour grows at just 0.4% a year), without further policy action structural borrowing would rise above 3% of national income (almost \u00a370 billion) in 2021\u201322 and rise further thereafter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Philip Hammond has woken up to some bad news. According to the well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, the chancellor is facing a new \u00a320bn black hole that could sink any hopes of a \u2018giveaway budget\u2019. The IFS has calculated that Britain\u2019s deficit is on track to still be \u00a336bn by the 2012-22 fiscal year. That\u2019s twice as much as the \u00a317bn forecast earlier this year. It erodes the \u2018wriggle room\u2019 which Hammond would hope to use to either cut taxes or boost public spending. So what\u2019s gone wrong? In short, Britain\u2019s long-running productivity problems means that growth is unlikely to be as strong as hoped, meaning the deficit will be even harder to eradicate: My colleague Richard Partington explains: The stark analysis adds to pressure on the chancellor as he appears increasingly trapped between the government\u2019s fiscal targets and calls to raise spending as the economy deteriorates and uncertainty over Brexit persists. He is due to deliver his budget on 22 November. \u201cIt is hard to see how the chancellor can both maintain the credibility of his fiscal targets and respond effectively to the growing demands for spending\u201d, the IFS said. At the root of the problem for Hammond is an admission by the government\u2019s official economic forecaster that weak levels of productivity since the financial crisis are unlikely to improve any time soon. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has said it will need to significantly lower its estimates for the economic output per hour worked in Britain. Brexit uncertainty is also weighing on the economy, says Paul Johnson, head of the IFS: Here\u2019s Richard\u2019s full story: I\u2019ll pull together more details and reaction now.... The IFS report tees up a busy day for economic news. Later this morning the Bank of England will release new figures showing how much Britons borrowed in September; this will show whether the consumer credit boom is cooling. We also get new growth figures from Spain \u2013 which is timely, as the Catalonian independence crisis deepens by the day. Plus, a fresh reading of Germany\u2019s inflation rate. Here\u2019s the agenda 8am GMT: Spanish GDP growth report for July-September 9.30am GMT: UK consumer credit and mortgage approvals report 10am GMT: Eurozone economic confidence figures for October 1pm GMT: German consumer prices figures for October",

She writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is a country that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tax-sell-property\">taxes British residents</a>, and British companies, when they make money on selling commercial real estate, but doesn\u2019t tax foreigners. That country is the UK. Closing the tax loophole around non-UK companies and commercial property sales would level the playing field for British businesses and at the same time help tackle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/30/uk-throes-of--housing-crisis\">overheated housing market</a>. It would also generate substantial revenue \u2013 enough to cover the entire public health budget for a year, for example.</p> <p>According to the British Property Federation there is <a href=\"http://www.bpf.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/PIA-Property-Report-2016-final-for-web.pdf\">about \u00a3871bn worth of commercial real estate</a> in the UK \u2013 10% of our nation\u2019s net wealth. Not only is this hugely important in its own right, its value impacts on the price of land, and hence of new homes. About 20% of commercial real estate is sold each year \u2013 worth an eye-watering \u00a3115bn in 2015, according to Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs.</p> <p>When a seller is a UK individual or company, they are subject to UK corporation tax on their capital gains. Yet where the seller is foreign they are not. Approximately one-third of all UK commercial real estate \u2013 including most high value property \u2013 is held through offshore companies. Typically these companies are in tax havens, or structured so they pay no tax on the capital gain. Indeed, British taxpayers should be asking tough questions as to why their government turns a blind eye to anyone who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/04/uk-properties-held-by-offshore-firms-used-in-global-corruption-say-police\">holds UK property in offshore companies</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Her full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/30/egregious-loophole-property-capital-gains-tax-close-foreign-owners-commercial\">This egregious tax loophole costs the UK \u00a38bn every year.

According to the well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, the chancellor is facing a new \u00a320bn black hole that could sink any hopes of a \u2018giveaway budget\u2019.</p> <p>The IFS has calculated that Britain\u2019s deficit is on track to still be \u00a336bn by the 2012-22 fiscal year. That\u2019s twice as much as the \u00a317bn forecast earlier this year.</p> <p>It erodes the \u2018wriggle room\u2019 which Hammond would hope to use to either cut taxes or boost public spending.</p> <p><strong>So what\u2019s gone wrong? </strong></p> <p>In short, Britain\u2019s long-running productivity problems means that growth is unlikely to be as strong as hoped, meaning the deficit will be even harder to eradicate: </p> <p>My colleague <strong>Richard Partington</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The stark analysis adds to pressure on the chancellor as he appears increasingly trapped between the government\u2019s fiscal targets and calls to raise spending as the economy deteriorates and uncertainty over Brexit persists. He is due to deliver his budget on 22 November.</p> <p>\u201cIt is hard to see how the chancellor can both maintain the credibility of his fiscal targets and respond effectively to the growing demands for spending\u201d, the IFS said.</p> <p>At the root of the problem for Hammond is an admission by the government\u2019s official economic forecaster that weak levels of productivity since the financial crisis are unlikely to improve any time soon. The Office for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/budget\">Budget</a> Responsibility (OBR) has said it will need to significantly lower its estimates for the economic output per hour worked in Britain.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brexit uncertainty is also weighing on the economy, says Paul Johnson, head of the IFS:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PJTheEconomist/status/924893001125687296\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mr Hammond will not be able to satisfy everyone, perhaps anyone, as he makes budget trade offs. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheIFS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theifs</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/O7awOW8e3N\">https://t.co/O7awOW8e3N</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Bjl0ev1l1O\">pic.twitter.com/Bjl0ev1l1O</a></p>&mdash; Paul Johnson (@PJTheEconomist) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PJTheEconomist/status/924893001125687296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Here\u2019s Richard\u2019s full story:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/30/uk-deficit-to-heighten-pressure-on-chancellor-ahead-of-budget\">UK deficit to heighten pressure on chancellor ahead of budget</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em><strong>I\u2019ll pull together more details and reaction now....</strong></em></p> <p>The IFS report tees up a busy day for economic news.

      "bodyText": "One of the oddest things about Australian economics is the market\u2019s continuing desire to believe inflation growth is going to come sooner rather than later and that, as a result, interest rates will also begin to rise. And yet time and time again, the inflation figures disappoint them. The latest low inflation growth figures \u2013 even with soaring electricity prices \u2013 suggest interest rates will remain stable for some time to come. Last week was a classic demonstration of just how weakly inflation is growing. The September quarterly growth figures were an unusually solid 0.6% \u2013 the third strongest in four years \u2013 and yet the annual inflation growth of 1.9% remained below the RBA\u2019s target range of 2%: It meant that money market investors (or speculators if you want to be less generous) were again revising their predictions of when interest rates would next rise. A month ago the market was fully pricing in a rise in the cash rate to 1.75% by next August; now it is barely 50% sure that such an event will occur: How would you like to have your financial adviser to tell you they have an absolute sure thing, only for a month later to come back to you and say, \u201cSo about that sure thing, turns out it\u2019s a coin toss\u201d? When we break down the inflation growth into tradables (items of which the price is mostly influenced by the world market) and non-tradabales (items like rents, childcare, education, property rates) we see that the price of our imports and goods affected by international prices fell, while the prices of non-tradables rose strongly \u2013 up 3.2%, the highest it has been for three years: Now in times past that might have been a sign that interest rates were about to rise \u2013 as that can be a sign that the local economy is heating up, and the RBA might be worried that inflation is about to jump. But the reason for the strong rise in non-tradable items wasn\u2019t that the economy is going gangbusters. Rather it was because of one of the biggest political hot potatoes going around \u2013 electricity and gas prices. The ABS noted that the average price of electricity across the country rose 8.9% in the September quarter and gas prices rose 5.2%. It means that both are now more than 10% higher than they were when the carbon price was rescinded in July 2014 \u2013 well ahead of overall inflation: But the rises are not uniform \u2013 Adelaide and Sydney have the biggest jumps in electricity prices, while Canberra takes the lead in gas price rises: And, as the ABS noted, it was due to rises in wholesale prices, rather than as a result of jumps in retail prices reflecting strong increases in demand. In effect, the price rises had nothing to do with the strength or lack thereof in the economy. It means the RBA\u2019s measures of underlying inflation remain pitifully low. Both the trimmed mean and the weighted median grew in the past 12 months by less than 2% \u2013 making it nearly two years that underlying inflation has been below the RBA\u2019s target band: It would fairly stretch credibility to think that the Reserve Bank would be thinking of raising interest rates in such a situation and yet the market continues to believe that stronger inflation growth must be just around the corner. The continuing low inflation also impacts on wages. Generally wages are \u201csticky\u201d ie they are slow at moving to changes in the economy. And with inflation being low for so long now, it is likely that even should inflation begin to rise it will take some time for wages to follow suit. The inflation expectations of union leaders remain very low over the next year, with some hopes for improvement to a more average growth of 2.5% over the next two years: It suggests wages growth will remain relatively weak, even in spite of improved employment, and that the interest rates rises the market keeps predicting might also have to wait a bit longer as well.",

It means that both are now more than 10% higher than they were when the carbon price was rescinded in July 2014 \u2013 well ahead of overall inflation:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Electricity, gas and inflation June 2014-September 2017\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MpmEF/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"406\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> But the rises are not uniform \u2013 Adelaide and Sydney have the biggest jumps in electricity prices, while Canberra takes the lead in gas price rises:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual price rise of electricity and gas by capital city\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0kpbL/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> And, as the ABS noted, it was due to rises in wholesale prices, rather than as a result of jumps in retail prices reflecting strong increases in demand. In effect, the price rises had nothing to do with the strength or lack thereof in the economy.</p> <p>It means the RBA\u2019s measures of underlying inflation remain pitifully low.</p> <p>Both the trimmed mean and the weighted median grew in the past 12 months by less than 2% \u2013 making it nearly two years that underlying inflation has been below the RBA\u2019s target band:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual underlying inflation growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3vGVk/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> It would fairly stretch credibility to think that the Reserve Bank would be thinking of raising interest rates in such a situation and yet the market continues to believe that stronger inflation growth must be just around the corner.</p> <p>The continuing low inflation also impacts on wages. Generally wages are \u201csticky\u201d ie they are slow at moving to changes in the economy. And with inflation being low for so long now, it is likely that even should inflation begin to rise it will take some time for wages to follow suit.</p> <p>The inflation expectations of union leaders remain very low over the next year, with some hopes for improvement to a more average growth of 2.5% over the next two years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Union officials inflation expectations\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AVpTN/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> It suggests wages growth will remain relatively weak, even in spite of improved employment, and that the interest rates rises the market keeps predicting might also have to wait a bit longer as well.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s \u00a34.5bn music industry is under threat because fans\u2019 cash is being diverted from their favourite acts, as they fork out for tickets sold by touts at vast mark-ups, according to a survey. The survey, released by anti-tout campaign group FanFair Alliance on Monday, found that two-thirds of respondents who had paid more than face value for a ticket on a resale site said they would attend fewer concerts in future, while half would spend less on recorded music. Adam Webb, a FanFair Alliance campaigner, said the survey supported fears that touting was doing \u201cconsiderable long-term damage\u201d to the music industry, which supports 142,000 jobs, according to UK Music. About 80% of more than 1,000 surveyed said secondary ticketing was a \u201crip off\u201d, while 58% said they would support limiting resale prices to face value. \u201cThe message from this research appears to be pretty clear: UK audiences are fed up,\u201d said Webb. He said fans were not against all resale but that \u201cthe majority would like the option to resell a ticket for the price they paid for it, and they\u2019re in favour of measures to curb mass-scale online ticket touting\u201d. The \u00a31bn-a-year secondary ticketing industry, where websites offer a platform to resell music, theatre and sports tickets, is already being investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) amid concern about the impact on fans and artists. The government has brought forward legislation to ban the use of automated software known as \u201cbots\u201d to harvest tickets but has shied away from broader restrictions. Evidence of fans\u2019 growing frustration came as analysis of more than 20 gigs showed that resale was dominated by touts, rather than genuine fans who suddenly found they could not go to an event. For a Jack Savoretti gig at Indigo at the O2 in London, 94% of tickets on the Ticketmaster-owned GetMeIn site were listed by professional ticket traders, as were 80% sold on eBay-owned StubHub. Many of the tickets are listed at significant mark-ups, despite the fact that the gig is not sold out and face-value tickets were still available as of Thursday. Both sites hosted listings by well-known professional traders, including Scotland-based Andrew Newman, identified by the Guardian last year as one of Britain\u2019s most successful touts. A gig by rock act Queens of the Stone Age at Wembley attracted similar attention, with 81% of StubHub\u2019s listings attributed to professional ticket traders and 64% of GetMeIn\u2019s. A StubHub spokesperson said it had less than 1% of capacity at these venues, adding that some of its tickets were sold for less than the original price and that 40% of tickets sold via the site in the UK were at face value or below. \u201cThe real problem is the lack of transparency in the primary market with the distinct lack of tickets made available to the general public,\u201d said StubHub. \u201cWe would like to see government bring forward rules that would mean that primary sellers have to list how many tickets they are actually listing for primary sale.\u201d While StubHub and GetMeIn publish information about who is selling tickets, Switzerland-based Viagogo does not. The website has been criticised for selling tickets that resulted in fans being denied entry, profiting from charity gigs, and refusing to cooperate with a parliamentary investigation. Analysis of its listings revealed that it advertised 916 tickets for one Lady Gaga concert, 674 for The Killers, 535 for Depeche Mode and 471 for Queens of the Stone Age. But none of the listings contained any information about who sold the tickets, leaving fans in the dark about who they were buying from.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Goldman Sachs has waded back in to the debate over Brexit by issuing another veiled threat about the Wall Street firm\u2019s employment plans in London as a result of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Lloyd Blankfein sent a tweet of an aerial shot of the new \u00a3350m European headquarters the bank has under construction in London, with the words \u201cexpecting/hoping to fill it up, but so much outside our control\u201d. It is the first tweet he has sent since the one a fortnight ago, when he was in Frankfurt and said he expected to spend more time in the German city. It comes amid continued uncertainty over negotiations for the UK\u2019s exit from the bloc. As part of its Brexit plans, Goldman is taking the top eight floors of a 37-storey block under construction in Frankfurt, which is expected to be ready for occupation in the third quarter of 2019. It had already begun work on a new European headquarters in London before the referendum in June 2016 and the 10-storey building is scheduled for completion in March 2019 \u2013 just as the UK is due to leave the EU. Goldman Sachs employs 6,000 staff in three premises in London and has the option to take all the space in the new building \u2013 just a stone\u2019s throw from its main London location in Fleet Street \u2013 or sublet space. Goldman has yet to disclose how many staff will be located in the new building. Many in the City are watching Goldman\u2019s occupancy plans for the new London headquarters as a gauge for the impact of Brexit on the financial centre. The Frankfurt building could house up to 1,000 staff \u2013 suggesting the prospect of adding 800 on top of the 200 already employed in the German financial centre. In January, Blankfein said that as a result of the vote to leave the EU Goldman was suspending a previous plan to shift some of its operations from New York to London. Sincethen, Richard Gnodde, chief executive of its international arm, has said the bank\u2019s Brexit plans include hiring extra staff in the remaining 27 EU nations to cope with the extra business which will be channelled through Europe instead of London. Major City firms are calling on Theresa May\u2019s government to clinch a deal over a transition period of two years to help ease uncertainty about the impact of Brexit. The City of London Corporation \u2013 the local authority for the Square Mile \u2013 last week warned an agreement was needed by the end of the year. Without an agreement, City firms are planning for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, one where the UK leaves the EU without access to the single market or retains any of its previous-style trading arrangements.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of HSBC has said Britain\u2019s biggest bank will wait as a long as possible before shifting jobs out of London as a result of Brexit, but warned that continued uncertainty could curtail foreign investment in the UK. Stuart Gulliver said that a transition arrangement, which industry groups have said needs to be in place by the end of the year, needed to contain clarity about the UK\u2019s future relationship with the remaining 27 members of the EU to reassure overseas investors. \u201cWhat [we\u2019re] really keen to have is clarity. A transition with clarity would start investment again,\u201d said Gulliver. Speaking as the bank reported a 41% rise in profits in the first nine months of the year, Gulliver said HSBC would wait as long as possible before moving jobs to its Paris operations. A year ago profits had been held back by the loss on the sale of its Brazilian operation. In the run-up to the June 2016 EU referendum he said 1,000 UK-based investment banking roles could move to France in the event of a vote to leave. However, on Monday Iain Mackay, the finance director, said up to 1,000 could transfer to Paris. Last week Swiss bank UBS also appeared to reduce the number of UK-based staff that could be impacted by Brexit. But Gulliver said that the bank had not seen any negative impact from its business clients so far and that clarity on a deal could restart investment in the UK. Gulliver will leave HSBC in February after 37 years \u2013 the last six as chief executive \u2013 and be replaced by John Flint, who has been at the bank for nearly 30 years. He is in the final phase of a plan to shrink the bank\u2019s global presence, shed 25,000 jobs and pivot towards Asia and said the bank\u2019s nine-month profits of nearly $15bn (\u00a311bn) reflected this strategy. Two-thirds of the profits are generated in Asia although HSBC is headquarted in London. His tenure coincided with the investigation by the Guardian and other publications into leaked files showing its Swiss arm helped customers avoid tax. The bank\u2019s attempts to comply with financial crime rules has left it facing criticism from small-business customers who have had their accounts closed down. Gulliver admitted that 50 customers had been compensated as a result of the bank\u2019s errors during this period and that 200 out of 1 million business customers had their accounts closed after the bank asked for information about their overseas payments. Gulliver said the bank was responding to enquiries from the Financial Conduct Authority and authorities in South Africa prompted by warnings from former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain of any possible links to South Africa\u2019s corruption inquiry into alleged ties between the wealthy Gupta family and the president, Jacob Zuma. The bank is also setting up a UK headquarters in Birmingham to comply with rules requiring it to ringfence its high street operations from its investment banking arm. After initial problems attracting staff, 90% of the roles had now been filled.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector could unlock \u00a3455bn over the next decade and create thousands of jobs if it cracks the fourth industrial revolution and carves out a successful post Brexit future. That is the conclusion of a government commissioned review on industrial digitalisation, published today and led by industry chief J\u00fcrgen Maier, the UK and Ireland boss of German engineering giant Siemens. A deal between government and industry could put Britain at the forefront of new technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, augmented and virtual reality, giving a much needed productivity boost and a net gain of 175,000 highly skilled, better paid jobs. Maier \u2013 who was tasked by Theresa May with providing a longterm vision for the industry \u2013 said the ambitious proposals outlined in the review could serve as an \u201cantidote\u201d to some of the tough challenges and higher costs facing the manufacturing sector as a result of the Brexit vote. \u201cThe business and academic community has set out a vision for much greater ambition needed for Britain to be a world leader in the fourth industrial revolution,\u201d Maier said. \u201cThe good news here is Britain is not starting from nothing. The UK has brilliant knowledge, assets and skills in this space but it is sometimes not as organised as it could be. \u201cThis combined package of measures will boost UK growth and productivity in manufacturing and provide more exports and increased earning potential, which our economy desperately needs.\u201d The 246-page review brings together in a series of recommendations the views and input from over 200 firms and organisations, including Rolls-Royce, Accenture and Cambridge and Newcastle universities. The so-called \u201cmade smarter\u201d proposals include building a national digital ecosystem \u2013 to be piloted in the north-west \u2013 which would give smaller and medium-sized engineering companies the chance to go to a physical space to experiment with new technologies and see how they might be applied to a process in their own factories. Government support through tax incentives and funding would also facilitate the process of adopting new technologies, the review concluded. The review also recommends the creation of 12 digital innovation hubs as part of a new national innovation programme to create new technologies and companies, where startups would work with universities and established firms such as Siemens. Thirdly, it calls for a new national body, titled Made Smarter UK Commission, including representatives from industry, government and academia to safeguard a longterm commitment to the work, which Maier hopes will lead to the \u201cupskilling\u201d of one million industrial workers in Britain. The government will now consider the proposals with the ultimate aim of agreeing a sector deal with industry that is likely to involve co-investment. Publication of a government white paper is expected before Christmas. The business secretary Greg Clark said the review outlined the huge potential digitalisation offers to manufacturing: \u201cThe UK manufacturing sector has the potential to be a global leader in the industrial digital technology revolution. Government and industry must work together to seize the opportunities that exist in this sector and promote the benefits of adopting emerging digital technologies, as well as cutting edge business models.\u201d It is hoped the net gain in jobs would be achievable \u2013 despite areas such as robotics and artificial intelligence making some traditional shopfloor roles redundant \u2013 through growth in the sector and new roles in IT, analytics, research and development. If taken up, the proposals would contribute an additional 3% to annual growth in manufacturing, Maier said. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI business lobby group said the plans would bring a \u201cnew energy\u201d to British industry. \u201cThe UK must compete with China, the US and much of Europe where there are already advanced plans to embrace the fourth industrial revolution,\u201d she said. \u201cI urge the government to consider these plans carefully, as they are focused on increasing productivity and wages, especially in smaller businesses.\u201d",

More than 100 cases were brought by the music licensing and performance rights body PPL, formerly known as Phonographic Performance Ltd, in the year to the end of March 2017. The Football Association brought 39 cases and the Performing Right Society 27. The FA has stepped up the number of actions in recent years \u2013 it brought five cases in 2013 \u2013 as the illegal streaming of matches on services such as Facebook and via pirate set-top boxes gathers pace. The governing body of UK football has focused its clampdown on owners of pubs and bars that are either not paying a full fee or using illegal streaming services such as Kodi boxes that circumvent the need to pay rights holders to watch sport. \u201cPubs are feeling the brunt,\u201d said Ciara Cullen, a partner at the professional services firm RPC, which analysed the cases brought to the high court. Sky and BT, which own billions of pounds of rights to sport including Premier League and Champions League football, made the top 10 list of claimants with 14 cases between them. Sky, which paid more than \u00a34bn for the rights to air the lion\u2019s share of Premier League matches in the UK, has been particularly aggressive in seeking to make an example of pirates to deter others. In two recent cases, Sky won damages against an individual who illegally streamed the Anthony Joshua\u2019s hugely popular world title fights against Wladimir Klitschko on Facebook, which attracted 600,000 viewers, and in another case against a Bristol man who illegally streamed Sky Sports on a pirate blog. Andrew Griffith, the group chief operating officer at Sky, said: \u201cWe are in the middle of a significant shift in tackling this type of piracy, a fightback that is making it harder and harder for people to stream content illegally.\u201d The Premier League won an injunction earlier this year that called on internet service providers such as Sky, BT and Virgin Media to block live football streams. This has had a real impact on the number of people visiting these sites. RPC found that bodies representing the music industry accounted for the majority of high court cases last year. PPL, which licenses recorded music on behalf of performers and the major record labels to places such as pubs, clubs and stores, was the single biggest claimant, bringing 106 cases. The Performing Right Society, which collects fees for the writers and publishers of music, ranked third with 27 cases. After a decade of declining revenues at the hands of pirates, the global music industry is back in growth, although revenue from legal digital services such as Spotify are at a far lower level than the heyday of booming CD sales. Cullen said: \u201cLegal action can be an effective way for music companies and their representatives to recoup some of the money lost from reduced sales from the digitisation of music content.\u201d RPC said the music industry remained extremely vigilant against nightclubs, pubs and restaurants that fail to pay for licences to play music, which accounted for 23% of cases brought by the PPL.",
