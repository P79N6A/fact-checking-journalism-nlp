      "bodyText": "It was around 10am on Thursday morning when the unwanted news arrived. Barry Tootell, the boss of the Co-operative Bank, had been braced for a downgrade of the bank's credit rating after it had plunged to a \u00a3600m loss and pulled out of the bidding for 632 Lloyds Banking Group branches. But Tootell could not have expected the devastating scale of the revision to the all-important rating. Moody's told the Manchester-based bank that in 12 hours' time it would be announcing a six-notch drop, plunging the Co-op to \"junk\" status \u2013 a move that would have a severe impact on any attempts to raise money in the financial markets and raise serious questions about its long-term future in banking. While Tootell had already resigned following the collapse of the deal with Lloyds, his decision was known to only a handful of colleagues and was yet to be announced publicly. With a decision made to bring forward news of his departure, senior officials began to prepare public statements expressing \"disappointment\" about the downgrade but reassuring customers that the bank was functioning normally and could sell off businesses to plug any shortfall in its capital levels. When Moody's published the news just before 10pm on Thursday, it was largely overlooked by the City. It was not until Friday that the impact was felt. Co-op does not have exchange-listed shares because its ultimate parent is a mutual, but it has publicly traded bonds, the price of which plunged by at least 20% on Friday, illustrating the impact of the downgrade on the once-fast growing bank. Reading the analysis, it is clear that the problems stem from the breakneck speed of expansion and the ground-breaking deal in 2009 when Co-operative Financial Services merged with the Britannia building society. The deal was struck during one of the toughest periods of the financial crisis; bank shares were plunging and yet the Co-op and the Britannia appeared to have sailed through unscathed. The boss of the Britannia, Neville Richardson, became the boss of the enlarged financial services group, working under the Co-operative Group's ambitious chief executive Peter Marks, who had just engineered the \u00a31.6bn purchase of the Somerfield food chain before embarking upon the now-abandoned takeover of the Lloyds branches, known as Project Verde. What Moody's analysis clearly revealed was that the Britannia lending portfolio \u2013 overseen by Richardson, who suddenly left the Co-op in 2011 with a \u00a34.6m payoff \u2013 could cause more big losses. It also made clear that, four years after the deal, the two businesses have never been fully integrated. It also became obvious that part of the problem was that the Verde deal had put a stop to existing integration programmes and complex IT upgrades. When it was first struck last year, Marks had high hopes that the Co-op was heading into banking's premier league. The Verde deal would be the crowning achievement of a career with the organisation that had started at the age of 17 as a shelf-stacker. The merger with the Britannia had combined the Co-op's 109 branches with the building society's 245. The Lloyds deal would triple the size of the network to close to 1,000 and Marks was keen to champion his operation's credentials and the terms he had struck. \"Look at our record as a bank,\" he said in March last year. \"We have gone through the worst financial crisis in living memory, where most of the big banks that had bankers running them came a cropper, and we didn't.\" Even in August, when cracks were showing in the Co-op's half-year figures, he was boasting about outflanking Lloyds chief Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, saying he had \"got the shirt off his back\". At face value, that was correct: the purchase price had been negotiated down to \u00a3350m, compared with Lloyds's original hopes of receiving \u00a31bn-plus. Lloyds was even going to supply some of the debt to fund the transaction, and the government was trumpeting the Co-op as a much-needed \"challenger\" that would inject competition into retail banking. The deal appeared opportunistic, just as the earlier swoop on Somerfield \u2013 where the Co-op was the only bidder for an 880-strong estate \u2013 had been. When Marks had started work at the Co-op back in 1967, the group had a 25% share of the grocery market. While he could not turn back the clock, the Somerfield deal would cement fifth place in the food retail sector. Both the Somerfield takeover and Verde were part of a belief that the Co-op needed to be bigger in its two core businesses in order to compete harder. But when Marks presented the last set of results in March, the food division reported a 9.5% slump in profits and the bank was plunged to that painful \u00a3600m loss. At the bank, the all-important \"tier one\" core capital ratio had fallen from 9.6% to 8.8% \u2013 a level that, Moody's noted, was low relative to its peers. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: \"For whatever reason, regulators have allowed the Co-op to run with weaker capital ratios than listed rivals, notwithstanding it's a more narrowly defined business.\" It does not have the ability to generate profits at the speed of its competitors, hence the importance of the bank to be able to tap its parents \u2013 the financial services group and then the wider Co-operative organisation. Selling out of insurance \u2013 the life business is already gone and the general, motor and home insurance arm is on the block \u2013 is the key to plugging any capital shortfall. The hope is that this will avoid a raid on the funeral homes, the supermarket or the pharmacies \u2013 or even tapping taxpayers for a bailout. The Co-op is determined it will not come to that. A solution seems unlikely to be found before next Saturday's annual meeting, when Marks bows out after a 45-year career. He leaves his successor \u2013 another retailer, the former B&amp;Q and Superdrug boss Euan Sutherland \u2013 with a decision about whether to remain in banking. At a time when the reputation of bankers is being battered, the Co-op, with its ethical stance and attention to customer service, should be thriving. A government determined to foster competition, and the Co-op's loyal savers, will be hoping that Sutherland can find a way through the mess.",

      "bodyText": "More than 100 postboxes were painted gold to celebrate Britain's medal haul at the 2012 Olympics, but those vivid symbols and thousands of others may not be British for much longer. Three decades after Margaret Thatcher refused to countenance a sale of Royal Mail, the coalition has committed to selling off the 497-year-old postal service within a year. The about-turn was underlined during last week's Queen's speech, when veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner quipped: \"Royal Mail for sale. Queen's head privatised\", probably a reference to Thatcher's own objection to the monarch's image falling into private hands. The Royal Mail's army of more than 130,000 postal workers has committed itself to fight the government every step of the way against a privatisation that the union claims will \"hurt staff, customers and thousands of small businesses\". In an unprecedentedly provocative move, the Communication Workers Union (CWU) is trying to get rural Tory MPs and other traditionally rightwing, small-government proponents, including the Countryside Alliance, to join an \"unholy alliance\" against the most ambitious privatisation since British Gas 26 years ago. But rather than back down, Michael Fallon \u2013 the business minister who set the wheels in motion for the sale \u2013 parked his tanks firmly on the CWU's lawn this weekend. In an interview with the Observer, Fallon warned the union that if it continued with its campaign against Royal Mail's flotation on the stock market, the government would explore selling the company to overseas buyers. The company's Canadian boss, Moya Greene, has already sounded out potential investors in her native Canada, the United States and Europe, and Fallon repeatedly warned that if the union's activism put at risk the \"preferred\" option of an initial public offering (IPO), it \"will look at other ways of getting capital into the business\". \"Our preference is for an IPO: but if that's not possible, we would look at alternatives [such] as sovereign wealth funds or other institutional investors,\" he said. \"It would certainly be less popular with postal workers and it would delay them getting the shares parliament said they should get [in the Postal Services Act 2011].\" The government, which is advised by UBS and Lazard, hopes to appoint lead bankers to run the sale by the end of this month, and hopes to start the sell-off process by the autumn. Royal Mail is being advised by some of the City's biggest guns: Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Potential private buyers include private equity funds such as CVC Capital Partners, which was in the running during the previous botched sale in 2009. TNT, the Dutch postal group, was also interested in the previous sale but it is thought to be mainly interested in Royal Mail's highly profitable parcel arm GLS. Other potential buyers could include the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar, which has been buying up large chunks of prime UK assets including Harrods, 95% of the Shard and stakes in Camden Market and Sainsbury's. Fallon categorically dismissed the union's demand that the Royal Mail \u2013 which has been owned by the state since Henry VIII established a \"master of the posts\" in 1516 \u2013 remain nationalised. \"It's a profitable, successful, company that needs access to new capital in order to continue to innovate to take advantage of a rapidly changing market,\" he said. The rise of email, Facebook and text messaging has led to a 25% fall in letter traffic over the past five years to just 58m items a day, while parcel delivery is booming thanks to the rise of Amazon, Asos and other internet retailers. Fallon said that if Royal Mail were to remain in state hands \"every \u00a31 it borrows is another \u00a31 on the national debt. \"That means growing the national debt. No responsible party could propose that in the current environment or for that matter in any environment when Royal Mail \u2013 run on a fully commercial basis \u2013 has the capacity to be cash generative, profitable and perfectly able to raise the capital it needs from the private sector.\" After years of losing money hand over fist \u2013 \u00a3320m in 2010 and \u00a3258m in 2011 \u2013 Royal Mail is now steadily increasing its profits. In the six months to September it made operating profits of \u00a3144m compared with \u00a312m a year earlier, while sales remained roughly flat at \u00a34.4bn. However, consumers will note that, over the same period the price of a first-class stamp has risen from 41p to 60p and many deliveries have been delayed until later in the day. The sale has also been made more attractive by the hiving-off of Royal Mail's \u00a312bn pension fund deficit to the state \u2013 at a cost of \u00a31.3bn in the first year alone. Fallon said the regulator's approval for price increases, the removal of the pensions headache and the splitting off of the Royal Mail from the Post Office, its more publicly beloved sister, means the coalition will be able to succeed where Thatcher, John Major and Peter Mandelson all failed. \"What actually stopped the privatisation under Thatcher was the combination of Royal Mail with Post Office, and the pensions,\" Fallon said. \"It's been changed.\" He says there is no argument now about whether the privatisation will happen, given that MPs have voted through the Postal Services Act 2011 that laid the way for the forthcoming sale. \"This is fully supported by the coalition. This is a commitment. It is very important not to delay any longer.\" Fallon implored Billy Hayes, general secretary of the CWU, to meet him to discuss the sale and the share awards to staff. Hayes countered that he regularly meets with Fallon, but accuses the minister of singing a changing tune. \"In the last meeting we had at the Department for Business, he gave us a copy of the Sun \u2026 and said to look at a story saying postal workers would get \u00a32,000 worth of shares,\" he said. \"Later in the meeting he said it would be \u00a31,000. They're all over the place on the shares.\" Fallon says it is impossible to say how much the postal workers' 10% stake might be worth because it is dependent on the flotation value. City analysts have put a \u00a32bn-\u00a33bn valuation on the company, which would mean \u00a31,500-\u00a32,300 per worker. But the government has refused to say whether workers will be handed the shares for free or offered to them at a discount to the sale price. Hayes said the government could not \"buy off\" his members with the offer of shares. \"People ain't going to turn away free money \u2013 but it's not going to impact on our members' stance to privatisation,\" he said. \"They can see what it means: break-up, sell-off and deteriorating service and conditions. \"Our people are also in BT and we know the impact of what happened [after privatisation] there \u2013 hundreds of thousand of job cuts. Then you get the break-up too.\" The union is in the process of sending out ballot papers to its 130,000 Royal Mail members for an independently monitored referendum on privatisation. Hayes said he was confident that members would vote overwhelmingly against the sell-off. Both Hayes and Fallon accuse each other of acting solely out of ideology. Fallon said the sale was a \"practical, logical, commercial decision\", not a dogmatic battle. Hayes is tossing party politics aside in order to hit the Tories where it hurts \u2013 by signing up backbench Conservative MPs in rural areas. \"We're making a series of unholy alliances,\" he said. \"We'll work with anybody to advance the interests of our members.\" He is targeting Tories in rural constituencies under pressure from voters worried that privatisation may threaten the frequency of deliveries in the countryside. The government has reiterated its pledge to maintain the universal service obligation \u2013 that is, to deliver to villages as well as cities at the same price \u2013 no matter how Royal Mail is sold. Hayes says the CWU is also in active talks with the Countryside Alliance and may approach Ukip, which is also said to be anti-privatisation. \"Obviously we won't be interested in fascists or racists, but if someone is prepared to work with us against the privatisation we'll work with them. \"They've got a fight on their hands,\" he says. \"We won't let the government take the Royal out of Mail and sell out British interest.\"",

Hayes countered that he regularly meets with Fallon, but accuses the minister of singing a changing tune. \"In the last meeting we had at the Department for Business, he gave us a copy of the <em>Sun</em> \u2026 and said to look at a story saying postal workers would get \u00a32,000 worth of shares,\" he said. \"Later in the meeting he said it would be \u00a31,000. They're all over the place on the shares.\"</p> <p>Fallon says it is impossible to say how much the postal workers' 10% stake might be worth because it is dependent on the flotation value. City analysts have put a \u00a32bn-\u00a33bn valuation on the company, which would mean \u00a31,500-\u00a32,300 per worker. But the government has refused to say whether workers will be handed the shares for free or offered to them at a discount to the sale price.</p> <p>Hayes said the government could not \"buy off\" his members with the offer of shares. \"People ain't going to turn away free money \u2013 but it's not going to impact on our members' stance to privatisation,\" he said. \"They can see what it means: break-up, sell-off and deteriorating service and conditions.</p> <p>\"Our people are also in BT and we know the impact of what happened [after privatisation] there \u2013 hundreds of thousand of job cuts. Then you get the break-up too.\"</p> <p>The union is in the process of sending out ballot papers to its 130,000 Royal Mail members for an independently monitored referendum on privatisation. Hayes said he was confident that members would vote overwhelmingly against the sell-off. Both Hayes and Fallon accuse each other of acting solely out of ideology. Fallon said the sale was a \"practical, logical, commercial decision\", not a dogmatic battle.</p> <p>Hayes is tossing party politics aside in order to hit the Tories where it hurts \u2013 by signing up backbench Conservative MPs in rural areas. \"We're making a series of unholy alliances,\" he said. \"We'll work with anybody to advance the interests of our members.\"</p> <p>He is targeting Tories in rural constituencies under pressure from voters worried that privatisation may threaten the frequency of deliveries in the countryside. The government has reiterated its pledge to maintain the universal service obligation \u2013 that is, to deliver to villages as well as cities at the same price \u2013 no matter how Royal Mail is sold.</p> <p>Hayes says the CWU is also in active talks with the Countryside Alliance and may approach Ukip, which is also said to be anti-privatisation. \"Obviously we won't be interested in fascists or racists, but if someone is prepared to work with us against the privatisation we'll work with them.</p> <p>\"They've got a fight on their hands,\" he says. \"We won't let the government take the Royal out of Mail and sell out British interest.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Austerians, as supporters of fiscal austerity have become known, frequently bemoan the hefty burden on future generations of the debts run up by spendthrift governments in battling the banking collapse. But a salutary report from the International Labour Organisation last week suggested that today's generation of young people is already bearing more than its fair share of the costs of the crisis. \"In advanced economies, long-term unemployment has arrived as an unexpected tax on the current generation of youth,\" the report says. In total, the ILO calculates that 73 million young people around the world are out of work \u2013 close to the peak during the Great Recession of 2008-09. And it's not just the jobless who have suffered over the past five years: the ILO suggests that a far larger number of young people have found themselves stuck in temporary work or part-time, insecure employment. That lack of financial security makes it harder to think about settling down, starting a family, planning for the future. For many millions of young people \u2013 an entire generation \u2013 the economic system is simply failing. In the rich world, perhaps the heaviest toll is being exacted in the bailed-out countries of the eurozone, where the austerity policies enforced by their creditors have helped to cause a catastrophic collapse in demand. The latest official figures, released last week, showed that in Portugal, the youth unemployment rate hit 42.1% in the first quarter of 2013, while in Greece, official figures show an extraordinary 64.2% of 15-to-24-year- olds out of work. Even the hardest-bitten austerians couldn't ignore the political risk of having such a large group of young people standing idle. It would be surprising if they didn't take to the streets \u2013 and in the years to come, it will be surprising if this neglected generation doesn't channel its resentment and anger into demands for a different economic approach. Widely cited research by the former Bank of England policymaker Danny Blanchflower and Professor David Bell of Stirling University demonstrates the long-term \"scarring\" effect of unemployment on young people's future careers. Even decades later, someone who was out of work for a stretch in their 20s is likely to be earning less on average than colleagues who were lucky enough to keep their jobs. But today's teenagers and twentysomethings, many of whom have watched the secure world of their parents dissolve into a confusing morass, are also likely to be politically marked by their experiences. In Europe, the elites who led their countries into the single currency club, promising prosperity and stability, have been ruthlessly exposed. Instead, Portugal, Greece, Ireland and now Cyprus have found themselves shackled to the slash-and-burn orthodoxy of their German paymasters, which young people may rightly feel they never signed up to. In the UK, meanwhile, young people are facing a dearth of sustainable jobs, just at a time when the coalition government is chipping away at out-of-work benefits, as ministers from the chancellor down berate the \"skivers\" whose blinds are still pulled down while their more virtuous neighbours trudge to work. Graduates who ran up huge debts to fund their university education have found that their degree may not be worth what they hoped in today's job market. The ILO's data shows a rapid increase in skills mismatches, as highly skilled workers take on jobs for which they are overqualified, and those with lower education levels are driven to the back of the queue. A generation of rising property prices \u2013 which has been only partly reversed during the downturn \u2013 has also helped to tilt the playing field. Even those young people with relatively well-paid jobs are finding themselves locked out of the home ownership market by high house prices \u2013 unless they are lucky enough to have parents able to stump up a deposit. Some of the solutions to the youth unemployment crisis are complex and small-scale: improving the career guidance students receive at school, making the education system more responsive to the needs of businesses and so on. But the ILO makes clear that the prevailing consensus in macroeconomic policymaking is also to blame for the plight of today's young people. It points out that economies with higher levels of investment tend to create more jobs, and calls for politicians to aim at diversifying their economies. But it says they should also undertake \"targeted demand-side interventions\", such as \"public employment programmes\" \u2013 Labour's Future Jobs Fund, scrapped by the coalition, is a good example \u2013 and \"labour-intensive infrastructure projects\", such as the war on potholes my colleague William Keegan called for in this column last week. Governments throughout the advanced economies must confront the fact that, by sucking demand out of the economy today, apparently in order to protect the taxpayers of tomorrow, they may be storing up deep economic and political problems that will impose painful costs of their own.",

Having committed \u00a31bn over three years to rights, talent, studios and marketing for its channels, BT has taken everyone by surprise in deciding to give them away to its own customers.

      "bodyText": "BT could mount its own FA Cup challenge with the string of footballers assembled to launch its sports channels. As would-be giant-slayers Setanta and ESPN learned to their cost, taking on Sky is clearly not something to be done without backup. In the BT camp, broadcasting from the Olympic park, are presenters and pundits Rio Ferdinand, David James and Michael Owen, while Gareth Bale and Robin van Persie are among those who will front an advertising blitz that involves taking over almost as many newspaper pages as were devoted to Sir Alex Ferguson's resignation. Across town in Sky's west London headquarters, Jamie Redknapp and the hugely popular Gary Neville will lead the satellite broadcaster's defence. Underpinning BT's heavyweight offering is lightweight pricing. Having committed \u00a31bn over three years to rights, talent, studios and marketing for its channels, BT has taken everyone by surprise in deciding to give them away to its own customers. Sensing a price war, City traders wiped millions off the market values of rival companies but sent BT's stock to a five-year high. Is this dramatic entry into sports broadcasting the \"game changer\" that BT's advertising slogan claims, or will it prove as over-hyped as an England World Cup campaign? More importantly for consumers, will BT Sport's arrival ultimately lead to an unravelling of the pay-TV model so profitably exploited by Sky and Virgin, whose customers are forced to buy a series of entertainment channels before being given access to the sports content that they really want? BT chief executive Ian Livingston's answer to the last question is an emphatic \"no\". His offering will be an alternative to the sell-through model, but will not replace it. Such is the Premiership's grip that most Sky subscribers will stay put. And it is worth noting that for many homes, BT Sport will not be entirely free.

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday evening, in a converted church in central London not far from Marks &amp; Spencer's headquarters, the retailer's chief executive, Marc Bolland, is expected to unveil the company's new autumn/winter collection \u2013 the first to be produced under the guidance of his new management team. After seven consecutive quarters of declining clothing sales, Bolland needs the new range to be a success \u2013 if it bombs, he is likely to lose his job. Here, fashion and retail experts advise on what the company must do to revive its fortunes. JULIAN DUNKERTON Chief executive and co-founder of SuperGroup, owner of Superdry The most important thing they need to do is listen to their customers and realise what the age group is that they are trying to target. Absolutely understanding your customer is vital in any business. You can't start trying to attract new customers until you've understood your current customers first. With Marks &amp; Spencer, they don't need to change to get other customers because of the base they already have. Multichannel [shopping] is also so important now and they need to make sure it is working properly to ensure a successful future. MELISSA LITTLER Director of online designer retailer BrandAlley Marks &amp; Spencer is one of those brands that is iconic on the high street and would be missed if it wasn't there. What they need to do is address the age group they are supposed to be targeting, because at the moment they don't appear to be targeting any particular group. They are trying to please everybody but end up pleasing nobody. They need to add style and be bold and brave at targeting whoever they think their customer is with fashionable items of good quality. However, you can have the best garments with the best quality at a good price, but if you don't have your distribution systems in order you are going to suffer. Too often the wrong sizes are in stores and customers are not going to wait for their size to come in. They are going to go online and buy it somewhere else. KIM WINSER Founder of retailer winserlondon.com and former M&amp;S head of womenswear The autumn season is always important in women's fashion: it's when people love knitwear and coats and occasionwear because there are a lot of events and parties. Knitwear, in particular, is a very large part of any woman's wardrobe spending and it's also very British because of the weather. To be successful M&amp;S needs to be bolder than it has been. If you're a business that has hundreds of stores and an impressive online site then you need to look good everywhere. To do that you need to take risks and buy sufficiently to get the collection to all stores and not just a few. When I worked there we always knew M&amp;S did particularly well during recessions because people would invest in good quality. I would hope they have followed the same reasoning, especially because today's consumers are really looking for good quality. They've done it with food, so they should be able to do it with clothes. People still love M&amp;S: it's in the British bloodstream and it's taken them a very long time to become disappointed. BILL GRIMSEY Former chief executive of Iceland, Wickes and Focus DIY M&amp;S's clothing has been its hallmark for years and its future success depends on the leadership. The whole culture of M&amp;S since the arrival of Marc Bolland, versus what [his predecessor] Stuart Rose had in place, has exposed the business. They have plainly got its positioning with customers wrong. Whereas Stuart Rose knew how to connect directly with customers \u2013 bringing in people like Twiggy and Alan Hansen \u2013 and got his range architecture right, Marc Bolland doesn't seem to be leading it in the right direction. You've also seen the advent of Primark and the cheap T-shirt culture, which has been difficult for M&amp;S. What made them what they were years ago was that they primarily used UK suppliers. This new team needed to have the confidence to get it right. When you get the \"queen of knickers\" [Janie Schaffer, the former Victoria's Secret creative boss who was hired as head of the M&amp;S lingerie department in January] in and she lasts three months, you've got to ask questions. It looks like a very constraining culture will [give M&amp;S] little freedom to act. You really need the opposite for success. JOHNNIE BODEN Chief executive and founder of Boden I'd love to run M&amp;S myself but nobody's asked me. I think it is trying to do too much. It has to focus on one customer and not try and be everything to everybody. I think the management have a very difficult job and they need to take some very hard decisions, which shareholders may not have the stomach for. Perhaps it would be better off if someone took it into private hands.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Royal Mail could fall into foreign hands if trade unions continue to fight its flotation on the London Stock Exchange, the business minister, Michael Fallon, has warned. Fallon said the government would sell Royal Mail to sovereign wealth funds or other foreign buyers if postal workers' campaign against a flotation in London makes an initial public offering (IPO) on the stock market difficult. He said numerous overseas buyers had already expressed \"significant interest\" in snapping up the 497-year-old postal service. \"It's a great British brand with the Queen's head on it,\" he told the Observer. \"We have already had quite a lot of interest in it.\" He revealed that Royal Mail's boss, Moya Greene, had already embarked on a global roadshow promoting the postal service to sovereign wealth funds and foreign trade buyers as well as institutional investors based in the UK and overseas. \"Royal Mail have been testing investor appetite here, in Canada and the United States,\" he said. \"There has been a lot of interest both at home and abroad.\" Fallon said the government would prefer to float the state-owned company, a forerunner of which was set up by Henry VIII in 1516, on the stock market and grant postal workers 10% of the shares in the company. \"Our preference is for an IPO, but if that's not possible we would look at alternatives [such] as sovereign wealth funds or other institutional investors.\" He said the government would much prefer to keep Royal Mail British and \"not delay any longer\" giving staff a 10% stake in the business. But he said the Communication Workers Union's (CWU) strong objection to privatisation, despite the payout of an expected \u00a31,500 to each of Royal Mail's 130,000 staff, meant the government had to plan other sale options. Keeping Royal Mail in state hands was not an option, he said, and urged the CWU to end its campaign to keep the postal service government-owned. \"We can't divert capital we need for schools and hospitals to Royal Mail \u2013 a very large business making substantial profits,\" Fallon said. He said he was \"surprised\" by the CWU's \"ideological objection to privatisation that would benefit all their membership [via] ownership of real stake and dividends\". He added: \"I would prefer the staff to have their stake now. Instead they [the union leaders] have organised an ideological ballot on the premise of privatisation.\" He said a sale into foreign hands \"would certainly be less popular with postal workers\" and would \"delay them getting the shares that parliament said they should get\". Billy Hayes, the general secretary of the CWU, said: \"The government is taking the Royal out of Mail and selling out British interest. No wonder Ukip is on the rise.\" He said that the government was \"rushing into a fire sale of the family silver on the cheap\" and a sale or flotation would result in a \"worse deal for customers, staff and thousands of small businesses dependent on the Royal Mail\". Hayes said the government could not \"buy off\" postal workers with the vague offer of an indeterminate value of shares in the privatised company. \"That's not going to cut the mustard,\" he said. \"Our members don't want \u00a31,500 if it is going to result in depressed terms and conditions and another five streets on a delivery.\" Fallon refused to state exactly how much of a stake postmen and women could expect from the privatisation, but said he would be \"disappointed if individual posties weren't able to have an investment above [\u00a31,500]\". He said the value of the postal workers' stake, which was enshrined in law two years ago, depended on how much the company was worth on flotation or sale. City analysts have put a \u00a32-3bn valuation on the company, which would mean \u00a31,500-\u00a32,300 per worker. \"Crucially the value depends on market and investor appetite,\" he said. The government hopes to appoint leading bankers to run the sale by the end of May, and hopes to start the process by the autumn. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said: \"Royal Mail is a treasured national institution. Going about making veiled threats about what you'll do if you don't get your way is no way to treat a much loved, hundreds-of-years-old institution \u2013 or its workers.\" Fallon said it was \"hard to be accused of rushing the sale by Labour\" who tried to sell off Royal Mail under the previous government. \"It is hardly a rush \u2013 successive governments have been trying [to privatise the postal service] for 28 years,\" he said. Margaret Thatcher, who privatised British Gas, British Airways, British Telecom and dozens of other state-owned institutions in the 1980s, famously refused to countenance a sale of Royal Mail, saying that she was \"not prepared to have the Queen's head privatised\". John Major and Lord Mandelson also tried, and failed, to sell the service. Potential private buyers include private equity funds, such as CVC Capital Partners, which was in the running during the previous attempted sale in 2009. TNT, the Dutch postal group, was also interested in the previous sale, but it is thought to be mainly interested in Royal Mail's highly profitable parcel arm GLS. Other potential buyers are likely to include the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar, which has being up large chunks of prime UK assets including Harrods, 95% of the Shard and stakes in Camden market and Sainsbury's. Royal Mail made an operating profit of \u00a3144m in the first half of its latest financial year, on sales of \u00a34.4bn. That compares with operating profit of \u00a312m on sales of \u00a34.2bn a year earlier. Its 2012-2013 full-year results, due to be released within the next two weeks, are expected show a further increase in profits. The government reiterated its pledge to maintain the universal service obligation to deliver mail six days a week to villages as well as cities at the same prices no matter how Royal Mail is sold.",

      "body": "<p>The Royal Mail could fall into foreign hands if trade unions continue to fight its flotation on the London Stock Exchange, the business minister, Michael Fallon, has warned.</p> <p>Fallon said the government would sell Royal Mail to sovereign wealth funds or other foreign buyers if postal workers' campaign against a flotation in London makes an initial public offering (IPO) on the stock market difficult. He said numerous overseas buyers had already expressed \"significant interest\" in snapping up the 497-year-old postal service. \"It's a great British brand with the Queen's head on it,\" he told the<em> Observer</em>. \"We have already had quite a lot of interest in it.\"</p> <p>He revealed that Royal Mail's boss, Moya Greene, had already embarked on a global roadshow promoting the postal service to sovereign wealth funds and foreign trade buyers as well as institutional investors based in the UK and overseas.</p> <p>\"Royal Mail have been testing investor appetite here, in Canada and the United States,\" he said. \"There has been a lot of interest both at home and abroad.\"</p> <p>Fallon said the government would prefer to float the state-owned company, a forerunner of which was set up by Henry VIII in 1516, on the stock market and grant postal workers 10% of the shares in the company. \"Our preference is for an IPO, but if that's not possible we would look at alternatives [such] as sovereign wealth funds or other institutional investors.\"</p> <p>He said the government would much prefer to keep Royal Mail British and \"not delay any longer\" giving staff a 10% stake in the business. But he said the Communication Workers Union's (CWU) strong objection to privatisation, despite the payout of an expected \u00a31,500 to each of Royal Mail's 130,000 staff, meant the government had to plan other sale options.</p> <p>Keeping Royal Mail in state hands was not an option, he said, and urged the CWU to end its campaign to keep the postal service government-owned. \"We can't divert capital we need for schools and hospitals to Royal Mail \u2013 a very large business making substantial profits,\" Fallon said.</p> <p>He said he was \"surprised\" by the CWU's \"ideological objection to privatisation that would benefit all their membership [via] ownership of real stake and dividends\". He added: \"I would prefer the staff to have their stake now. Instead they [the union leaders] have organised an ideological ballot on the premise of privatisation.\"</p> <p>He said a sale into foreign hands \"would certainly be less popular with postal workers\" and would \"delay them getting the shares that parliament said they should get\".</p> <p>Billy Hayes, the general secretary of the CWU, said: \"The government is taking the Royal out of Mail and selling out British interest. No wonder Ukip is on the rise.\" He said that the government was \"rushing into a fire sale of the family silver on the cheap\" and a sale or flotation would result in a \"worse deal for customers, staff and thousands of small businesses dependent on the Royal Mail\".</p> <p>Hayes said the government could not \"buy off\" postal workers with the vague offer of an indeterminate value of shares in the privatised company. \"That's not going to cut the mustard,\" he said. \"Our members don't want \u00a31,500 if it is going to result in depressed terms and conditions and another five streets on a delivery.\"</p> <p>Fallon refused to state exactly how much of a stake postmen and women could expect from the privatisation, but said he would be \"disappointed if individual posties weren't able to have an investment above [\u00a31,500]\".</p> <p>He said the value of the postal workers' stake, which was enshrined in law two years ago, depended on how much the company was worth on flotation or sale. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/apr/29/royal-mail-sale-thatcher\" title=\"\">City analysts have put a \u00a32-3bn valuation on the company, which would mean \u00a31,500-\u00a32,300 per worker</a>.</p> <p>\"Crucially the value depends on market and investor appetite,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne on Saturday warned Britain's offshore tax havens that they will need to share more information on wealthy taxpayers as the UK seeks to extend a pilot for exchanging tax information across Europe. Overseas territories, mostly in the Caribbean, that have built extensive financial centres would need to sign up to broader tax-sharing agreements to show Britain was leading the global fight against tax evasion, he said. The tough message, which Osborne delivered at the Group of Seven gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors outside London, comes before a meeting of European finance ministers on Monday which is expected to block proposals for sharing information about wealthy taxpayers. Osborne wants the finance ministers to implement a directive that will involve countries giving details about the assets kept by savers across the EU. Austria and Luxembourg have so far blocked the directive, citing the UK's failure to force offshore financial centres to comply with basic cross-border rules. But a series of agreements to multi-lateral information sharing by Britain's offshore territories has, according to the Treasury, brought them into line with rules policed by the OECD thinktank which monitors tax evasion for the world's richest nations. The UK has joined a pilot scheme with Germany, France, Spain and Italy aiming to pioneer a new standard for automatic information sharing following a similar arrangement with the US. Previously, information was passed between tax authorities under exclusive bilateral agreements. The chancellor wants overseas territories along with developing world nations and other European countries and the Japanese to join the American Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca) initiative, but is concerned that Austria and Luxembourg will continue to block progress in the EU. \"All jurisdictions should take part in the initiative to stop tax evasion,\" he said. \"We want international tax rules to be fit for the 21st century.\" The UK has put tax evasion on the agenda for next month's G8 meeting, when David Cameron will play host to leaders of the world's most powerful nations, including Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin. Cameron has also signalled his intention to discuss an initiative by the OECD to reform tax rules that currently allow multinational corporations to move billions of pounds of profits to low-tax jurisdictions. This week MPs will question the UK boss of Google and the head of UK tax at accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young, which audits Google, about the US company's failure to pay corporation tax. Osborne said the UK was unapologetic in seeking to attract global businesses after cutting the headline rate of corporation tax to 20% by next year. He said: \"I am committed to a competitive tax system that promotes growth, but I'm also determined tax that is owed must be paid.\" Tax campaigners have urged the government to take a harder line with overseas territories, despite agreements with the Cayman Islands and Bermuda among others that promote information sharing. Osborne, who is known to have little sympathy for offshore tax havens, said they should join the Fatca initiative to put them at the forefront of the crackdown on evasion.\"What I would say about this initiative is this: it's incredibly important that companies and individuals pay the tax that is due, and this is important not just for Britain and British taxpayers but also important for many developing nations as well,\" he said. Many developing world countries are unable to join information sharing groups until they upgrade their IT systems and put in robust controls to protect details concerning individual taxpayers. HMRC is supporting the Tanzanian government's overhaul of its tax systems and is hopeful it will join Fatca.",

      "bodyText": "The G7 group of industrialised nations has agreed collective action needs to be taken to target tax avoidance and evasion, the chancellor George Osborne has said. Speaking at the end of the two-day summit of finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, Osborne said it was \"incredibly important that companies and individuals pay the tax that is due\". Osborne said there was also strong agreement among the seven member nations \u2013 the United States, Germany, Japan, the UK, Italy, France and Canada \u2013 on tackling tax cheats. \"We all agreed on the importance of collective action to tackle tax avoidance and evasion,\" he said. \"It is incredibly important that companies and individuals pay the tax that is due and this is important not just for Britain and for British taxpayers but also for many developing nations as well.\" Osborne said British overseas territories \"need to do more\" to end tax evasion. Asked about the future of tax havens such as Jersey or the Cayman Islands, he said he had already been very tough in his message to them but wanted to see more action. \"Of course you have to respect that many of these territories have important industries and we don't want to unnecessarily damage them. \"But it is necessary to collect tax that is owed and it is necessary to reduce tax avoidance and the crown dependencies and the overseas territories need to play their part in that drive and they need to do more.\" The chancellor said there was also consensus to ensure banks are no longer \"too big to fail\". He added there is an \"improved outlook\" for the world economy, with more agreement among the rich member nations on how to nurture the recovery than was often suggested, but admitted the situation remains fragile. \"We are of course meeting at a time when financial market sentiment has improved and there are signs that this is feeding through to an improved outlook in some of our economies,\" Osborne said. \"However we all agreed that growth prospects remain uneven and we can't take the recovery for granted.\" While there were \"still many challenges\", he said, \"this meeting confirmed that there are more areas of agreement between us on fiscal policy than is commonly assumed.\" Among those attending the talks was Canada's central banker Mark Carney who takes over from Sir Mervyn King as Bank of England Governor in July. King said the meeting had been the most productive of the 25 he had attended during his term at the helm. Joking about his impending departure, King said: \"In a week in which retirement came to Sir Alex Ferguson, it is pretty clear it has to come to everyone. I am looking forward to a new life.\" Also at the talks was IMF managing director Christine Lagarde as the body undertakes its annual health check of the UK. The IMF, which will deliver its verdict later this month, has already suggested Osborne must be more flexible with his deficit-reduction plans. Shadow treasury minister Catherine McKinnell said: \"It's disappointing that this G7 meeting has failed to set out any concrete steps to promote economic growth or tackle tax avoidance.\"",
