      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, won\u2019t easily silence the calls for a breakup of the out-of-fashion pharmaceuticals, vaccines and toothpaste giant \u2013 but the company\u2019s decent finish to 2015 should buy him some time to move at his own pace. Underlying earnings per share of 75.7p for 2015 didn\u2019t cover the 80p dividend, but the reinvention of GSK was always going to be the work of several years. Witty was able to promise that new pharma products, meaning those launched over the past three years, will achieve \u00a36bn of sales in 2018, two years ahead of the original target. Breo, the drug that will lead the defence of the respiratory territory when fading blockbuster Advair is hit by generic competition in the US, has overcome its slow start. So far, so good. The breakup argument, as advanced by the fund manager Neil Woodford, hinges on the idea that the sum of GSK\u2019s parts is worth more than the current stock market value. Witty cannot be surprised to hear these cries, since he toyed with the notion of floating off ViiV, the 80%-owned HIV business, a couple of years ago. These days, the consumer products division, where GSK and Novartis pooled assets in a broader three-part deal in 2014, is the focus of the splitters\u2019 attention. Witty isn\u2019t saying never, but he surely makes a fair point when he argues that now is not the right moment. The ambition is to double profit margins in consumer products such as Sensodyne over five years. That plan is on track after the first year. Why sell even a sliver before you\u2019ve bagged the easy gains? Reckitt Benckiser, or whoever, will still be around a couple of years from now. Then there\u2019s the troubled question of the right corporate \u201cbalance\u201d. GSK is a broader beast than most of its pharma brethren, but that might soon be an advantage, if the next US administration cuts up rough on the price of prescription medicines. Vaccines and consumer products, with their \u201cannuity-like\u201d earnings, as Witty puts it, are useful defensive assets. More to the point, there\u2019s no sign that GSK is managing them badly. Under-fire chief executives can resist most criticism as long as the share price goes up. GSK has been a laggard in recent years, which is why investors are growling. But, at \u00a314.31, there\u2019s a fair argument that GSK is a heads-you-win, tails-you-don\u2019t-lose investment. If Witty\u2019s strategy, complete with up to 20 filings of new pharmaceuticals by 2020, works, then the dividend \u2013 offering a 5.5% yield \u2013 should be safe. If it all goes horribly wrong, the emergency button is the breakup idea. But pressing the button now seems pointless. There is no emergency. Silence is deafening from Sports Direct Most FTSE 100 companies accused by a high court judge of abusing the legal system by bringing \u201ca ridiculous piece of litigation\u201d would be anxious to explain themselves. Not Sports Direct. There was silence from Shirebrook as the sportswear retailer abandoned its legal battle with Rangers football club. Mr Justice Peter Smith said last month that the company\u2019s request to imprison the Rangers chairman, Dave King, was \u201cdesigned to intimidate\u201d rather than be a proper sanction for an claimed breach of a confidentiality clause. \u201cIt was a muscular tactic using the threat of committal that the court should deplore,\u201d the judge said. This dispute over confidentiality relates to a joint venture to run Rangers\u2019 club shop that is irrelevant, financially speaking, to Sports Direct. It is tiny in the context of the group. So why continue with a claim that the court regarded as a waste of time and the pursuit of a vendetta? Only two people can answer that question. One is Mike Ashley, the owner of 55% of Sports Direct and about 9% of Rangers. The other is Keith Hellawell, Sports Direct\u2019s chairman, who ought to be concerned for the company\u2019s reputation. If Hellawell can\u2019t muster a word after such damning remarks by a judge in the high court, outside shareholders will wonder \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 what he is still doing at Sports Direct. Syngenta deal may be repellent to western regulators As Syngenta agreed to be taken over by ChemChina for $43.8bn in cash, the Swiss pesticide group\u2019s chairman, Michel Demar\u00e9, declared: \u201cThis is absolutely not a China nationalisation.\u201d Really? ChemChina may say it wants to run Syngenta according to western governance principles. But if you are 100% owned by a Chinese state-owned company, you are, to all intents and purposes, controlled by the Chinese state. Expect US and European regulators to take a close look at the effect of a takeover on their agriculture industries. This is far from a done deal.",

EasyFoodstore closed on Wednesday afternoon and is expected to reopen on Friday morning after it has re-stocked the shelves. A spokesman for easyFoodstore, in Park Royal, north-west London, said: \u201cThe level of interest has been completely overwhelming. The last people through the door today had travelled up from Canterbury. \u201cWe anticipated we had enough stock to last a couple of weeks but it has just gone in a day and a half.\u201d The retailer, which has the slogan \u201cNo expensive brands. Just food honestly priced\u201d, says it still plans to sell its items for 25p each throughout February as an introductory offer. Prices will then go up but are expected to remain very low. The store appears to have captured the imagination of shoppers as a step on from the fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have forced major supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons to close stores and cut prices. EasyFoodstore sells a range of just 76 grocery items including pasta, biscuits and beans. It does not sell fresh meat or fruit and vegetables. Haji-Ioannou first announced plans to open a discount food store in August 2013. Back then, he said the idea was inspired by the widespread use of food banks. His charity has long handed out free food to struggling families in Greece and Cyprus. A mock easyFoodstore was built in Croydon a year later, but the tycoon\u2019s plans appeared to stall, with the first shop opening for customers this week. The store is intended to be a pilot for a chain. Haji-Ioannou and his family still own about 35% of easyJet and are the biggest shareholders. He has already expanded the \u201ceasy\u201d brand into a string of other industries, creating easyCar, easyHotel, easyGym and easyProperty.",

Pressed by the committee chair, Andrew Tyrie, on whether the Bank is looking at the contingency planning of major financial institutions such as HSBC and Barclays, Bailey said there had been signs of investment activity around the strength of the pound. \u201cSince Christmas, there have been quite marked changes in the pricing of sterling options,\u201d he said. \u201cWe obviously then go back to institutions and question what their exposure to this is.\u201d But this is one of several factors the Bank is monitoring, Bailey said, arguing that \u201coil prices and emerging markets are in some ways much bigger issues\u201d. Bailey said proposals backed by David Cameron to make it harder for eurozone countries to impose rules on Britain\u2019s financial sector needed fleshing out. The offer safeguards to limit the ability of eurozone members to impose regulation on the City of London, the EU\u2019s biggest banking centre, as part of reforms designed to dissuade Britons from voting to leave the bloc. \u201cThese are the right words. Let\u2019s now flesh them out,\u201d Bailey said, referring to proposals which will be discussed at a summit of EU leaders in two weeks\u2019 time. \u201cThe devil is in the detail. We have a vision as to how it could work. It does not mean it\u2019s as cemented in as it should be.\u201d In theory, the new framework would make it easier to change poorly thought-out rules such as the solvency II regulations for insurers, Bailey said. Britain\u2019s referendum on staying in the EU is expected to take place in June.",

Old Mutual, Home Retail\u2019s third largest investor with a 3.6% stake, issued a statement to the stock exchange saying it viewed the terms of Sainsbury\u2019s 161.3p a share deal put forward on Tuesday as \u201cfair, reflective of the future potential of the Argos business and the risk still associated with the transformation plan\u201d. Previously, Richard Buxton of Old Mutual said of a bid that it must \u201cstart with a two in front of it\u201d. An offer worth 200p a share would have valued Home Retail at \u00a31.63bn, compared to the \u00a31.3bn in cash and shares offered by Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cSince that time, there has been the agreed disposal of Homebase by Home Retail, their update on Christmas trading and more detail on the opportunities for Home Retail within the Sainsbury group,\u201d Old Mutual said in the statement. The unusual statement comes as Home Retail said it would hold a shareholder meeting on 25 February in Milton Keynes to approve the \u00a3340m sale of Homebase to Australian retail group Wesfarmers. Documents filed to the stock exchange ahead of the meeting reveal that Home Retail will have to pay Wesfarmers a \u00a33.4m break fee if the sale of Homebase does not go ahead or directors withdraw their recommendation. It also shows that Richard Ashton, Home Retail\u2019s finance director, holds 1.16m shares in the company, which would hand him nearly \u00a31.9m in the event of a takeover by Sainsbury\u2019s. John Walden, the Home Retail chief executive, holds nearly 650,000 shares, worth just over \u00a31m. If they are made redundant after the takeover, they would be entitled to a year\u2019s salary and benefits including pensions, amounting to about \u00a3896,000 for Walden and \u00a3622,600 for Ashton. The sale of Homebase will help clear the way for Sainsbury\u2019s takeover of Argos, which is expected to take three to six months. The terms of the Sainsbury\u2019s deal include a 25p-a-share return of cash to shareholders funded by the proceeds of the sale of Homebase. The supermarket has been given three weeks to examine Home Retail\u2019s books before making a firm offer that will then be put to shareholders. Home Retail\u2019s board, led by Walden, has already said it is minded to recommend the deal, provided that agreement can be reached on terms and conditions.",

      "bodyText": "The Labour MP and tax campaigner Margaret Hodge has described as \u201cdisgusting\u201d a plan to give an executive of online retailer Amazon, one of the companies at the centre of an intensifying row over taxes, a directorship at the Department for Work and Pensions. Hodge was responding to the news, first revealed by Sky News, that Amazon\u2019s head of Chinese operations, Doug Gurr, is to become a non-executive director of the DWP. The DWP said it would issue a statement, which was not available at the time of publication. Amazon declined to comment. Hodge said: \u201cIf people are not putting their proper share into the pot, how can government ever justify giving them prestigious positions?\u201d Amazon\u2019s UK business paid just \u00a311.9m in tax in 2014, even though its Luxembourg unit took \u00a35.3bn from internet sales in the UK. Gurr\u2019s arrival at the department will increase fears that largely US-based technology giants such as Amazon are having an increasing influence on government at a time when there is growing public pressure for them to pay more tax in the UK. Hodge also said it was ironic for the DWP, which is trying to place people in employment, to hire an executive from Amazon. \u201cThey are killing off British business and jobs, partly because they\u2019re not paying sufficient tax and so are able to undercut their rivals,\u201d she said. The multinational tax row has intensified since it emerged that Google had agreed to pay \u00a3130m to cover taxes dating back a decade. Although George Osborne heralded the deal as a success, it was soon derided by critics, who calculated that the payment equated to a tax rate of just 3%. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, said he shared the feelings of many people who felt there was a sense of injustice about the Google deal and described the tax settlement as \u201cnot a glorious moment\u201d for the government. Google has enjoyed a close relationship with the government, with key figures going to work for the US company as well as some executives going from the firm to Whitehall. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cI am disappointed but not surprised, and taxpayers will be further dismayed, to hear about yet another close relationship between the Tory government and a company with potential questions to answer over its tax liabilities. \u201cOn the back of a fortnight of inaction from the government on tax avoidance, this will do nothing to dispel the feeling that when it comes to tax avoidance the Tories don\u2019t have a credible solution, and don\u2019t care about finding any answers. \u201cThat is why I am today calling for the government to be open and honest over any Tory tax deals with big multinationals so that we can start to find a proper solution to the crisis we face over tax avoidance. Especially after the missed opportunity in the EU negotiations to get a deal on transparency by companies across Europe.\u201d Jolyon Maugham, a tax expert and former adviser to the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, said: \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t had such a revolving door between government and Google, perhaps we would not be asking questions about a sweetheart deal. \u201cGovernment is absolutely right to want to bring business expertise into the heart of government, but it needs to do so in a way that avoids obvious conflicts of interest. To take a senior executive from a company that\u2019s seen by many as a poster child for an aggressive approach to workplace standards and put him at the heart of the Department for Work and Pensions is pretty punchy.\u201d In December, a Guardian investigation revealed how overseas traders on Amazon\u2019s UK website were selling goods without charging VAT. The abuse is estimated to have cost the Treasury tens of millions of pounds in lost tax receipts over the Christmas period alone. The investigation prompted HMRC to hold urgent meetings with Amazon, and Treasury spokesman Lord Ashton told the House of Lords that the government was considering whether Amazon could be held liable for tax losses \u2013 an option the Treasury has since ruled out. Conservative peer Lord Lucas claimed Amazon and eBay had been \u201ccollaborating with hundreds of overseas retailers to defraud the taxman of millions of pounds every day\u201d. The allegation was denied by both groups. Last month, outgoing HMRC chief executive Dame Lin Homer told MPs this kind of widespread evasion by overseas sellers had become \u201ca very big issue\u201d. She said: \u201c[Online] marketplace providers have responsibilities\u201d, but she failed to say how these might be enforced under current laws. Amazon has continued to insist it is not responsible for policing the VAT compliance of traders using its site. Last year, eBay and Amazon stepped up marketing drives in China aimed at traders looking to ship to the UK and other European markets.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has dramatically backed down from its legal battle with Rangers football club and abandoned efforts to prevent disclosure of the pair\u2019s joint venture, which has made the Old Firm club about 4p from every pound spent in its Ibrox store. An interim gagging order was imposed last summer, blocking Rangers from publicly revealing details of its agreement with the retailer, which contains swingeing clauses and was already subject to commercial confidentiality agreements. By continuing with efforts to extend the order, Sports Direct\u2019s founder, Mike Ashley, who owns 55% of the nationwide chain and about 9% of Rangers, faced being called to the high court to give evidence. In agreeing to Sports Direct\u2019s request to abandon its case, the high court judge Mr Justice Peter Smith said he was keen to curtail \u201cthis ridiculous piece of litigation\u201d. He also allowed Rangers to discuss parts of the confidential agreements that are already in the public domain or in order to correct inaccurate statements made by Sports Direct. Sports Direct had already lost legal moves to have the Rangers chairman, Dave King, found guilty of contempt of court and sent to prison for allegedly breaching the order, resulting in the retailer\u2019s business tactics being criticised by Smith. The retreat by Sports Direct comes after the Scottish club\u2019s supporters demanded that the retail deal was renegotiated, arguing that it is heavily weighted in favour of the FTSE 100 company. A Guardian analysis of the Rangers accounts suggests that the club\u2019s joint venture with Sports Direct, Rangers Retail Ltd, has paid the Scottish championship team dividends of about \u00a3559,000 since the deal came into effect almost four years ago. During that time, the Rangers store has taken more than \u00a313m through its tills from fans, while a previous retail deal with JJB Sports saw the club receive an initial payment of \u00a318m, with a guaranteed minimum annual royalty of \u00a33m. Over the same four-year period, the accounts also suggest that Sports Direct was paid three times Rangers\u2019 dividends, totalling about \u00a31.8m. On top of those payments, it has also earned hundreds of thousands of pounds from the joint venture for providing retailing services. Despite the difference in the amounts received by each party, Rangers owns 51% of Rangers Retail, while Sports Direct holds the remaining 49%. The agreements between the pair also include: A seven-year notice period to break the contract A confidentiality agreement that binds Rangers but not Sports Direct Obligations for Rangers Retail to buy stock at a \u201chigher cost than its retail value\u201d A clause allowing Sports Direct to force Rangers out of its shareholding in Rangers Retail if the relationship between the club and the retailer is \u201cdeadlocked\u201d A further clause that forced the football club to pay Sports Direct \u00a3620,000 for closing down two former Rangers stores in Glasgow and Belfast Zero upfront payment to Rangers for awarding the retail deal to Sports Direct in 2012 A controlling vote for Sports Direct on \u201cfinancial matters\u201d concerning Rangers Retail For 11 months of last year, Rangers lost control of Rangers Retail after the club handed over 26% of the subsidiary\u2019s shares to Sports Direct as security for a loan. During the time Rangers had a minority interest, the accounts show a \u00a3300,000 dividend paid to the football club, which suggests that Sports Direct received \u00a3900,000. The club now holds 51% of Rangers Retail again after repaying the \u00a35m debt. The seemingly one-sided nature of the deal between the sporting brands has contributed to the evaporation of a functional working relationship between Ashley and King, who owns about 15% of Rangers. In January, Sports Direct was accused by a high court judge of abusing the legal system to \u201cintimidate\u201d the Rangers chairman and pursue a vendetta against Ashley\u2019s rival. Sports Direct claimed that Rangers breached the terms of a confidentiality agreement between the retailer and the football club, as well as the court gagging order, and attempted to have King sent to prison. Smith, who cleared King of contempt, said: \u201cFrom start to finish, [the request to imprison King] was designed to intimidate rather than seek a proper sanction for an alleged breach. It was a muscular tactic using the threat of committal that the court should deplore.\u201d Sports Direct did not comment on the retail deal with Rangers or the outcome of its legal case on Wednesday. Ryan Mowat, a partner at Rangers\u2019 law firm Kingsley Napley, said: \u201cRangers are pleased that Sports Direct have today discontinued their claim for a permanent injunction ... Fortunately, the judge has been alive to the \u2018game playing\u2019 of Sports Direct, which has helped to expose the case for what it is.\u201d The methods employed by Sports Direct and its founder have come under a barrage of criticism since December, in the wake of a Guardian investigation that found that the retailer was effectively paying thousands of temporary warehouse workers below the minimum wage. The coverage led to an urgent question and debate in parliament, calls for an investigation by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, and a denunciation from the Institute of Directors, which described Sports Direct as a \u201cscar on British business\u201d. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Sports Direct pledged \u00a310m for a pay rise for staff from the start of this year.",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is cutting 1,755 jobs and closing 29 branches as part of a plan by its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, to cut costs as he prepares the bank for privatisation. Staff at Britain\u2019s biggest retail bank were told about the job losses, which cover large parts of the group, on Wednesday, but union officials said they hoped that the reductions could be achieved by voluntary means. The bank said it would add 170 new jobs in retail and commercial banking and in its legal team, taking the net figure for job losses to about 1,585. Horta-Os\u00f3rio is continuing with the cost reduction programme even though the chancellor, George Osborne, has admitted that he cannot press on with a sale of the government\u2019s remaining Lloyds shares to the public because of market turmoil, which has knocked the bank\u2019s share price. The posts that are being axed are part of the 9,000 job cuts announced by Horta-Os\u00f3rio in 2014, when he said that a need to \u201cdigitise\u201d the business would also result in the closure of 200 branches. According to officials at the Accord union, which has 23,000 members, about 60% of those cuts have now been announced. Lloyds, which operates under a number of brands, will close 19 Lloyds, seven Bank of Scotland and three Halifax branches in June. The bank employs about 77,000 people and has more than 2,000 branches. Accord officials said: \u201cThis is a difficult time for those affected. However, Accord\u2019s agreement with the bank means that no employee will be redundant other than through voluntary means. We will provide advice and support to colleagues who will be impacted by the branch closures.\u201d The roles that are going include 140 at assistant branch manager level, and follow the 1,000 job cuts announced in November. Accord said it was concerned that workers who remained at Lloyds would be forced to take on more work, as positions continue to be scrapped. The union told its members: \u201cWhile the initial focus will be on the individuals who are impacted by the announcement, Accord will also be engaging with Lloyds regarding the impact on those who will remain with the bank. \u201cResources are already stretched and we are concerned that further reductions in staffing levels could exacerbate the existing problems in relation to security, keyholding, booking holidays, absence etc. There comes a point where it is not possible to achieve more with less; only less can be achieved with less.\u201d Lloyds said: \u201cThe group\u2019s policy is always to use natural turnover and to redeploy people wherever possible to retain their expertise and knowledge within the group. Where it is necessary for employees to leave the company, it will look to achieve this by offering voluntary redundancy. Compulsory redundancies will always be a last resort.\u201d Lloyds cut 45,000 jobs after it bought HBOS in a rescue deal during the financial crisis in 2008. The government owned 43% of Lloyds after it bailed out the bank in 2008, but that stake has been reduced to less than 10% through a series of sales to institutional investors. With stock markets in a volatile state because of worries about the global economy, the Treasury will wait until after Easter to launch the Lloyds share sale.",

    "webTitle": "Markets fall on weak US services industry data \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The slower growth in US services has pushed Wall Street into negative territory, with the Dow Jones industrial average now down 32 points or 0.2%. The FTSE 100 has seen its falls accelerate and is now down 70 points, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 has lost 1.3%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision on Super Thursday. The ISM services report for the US is also showing a slowdown in growth last month. The index came in well below expectations at 53.5 in January, compared to 55.8 in December and forecasts of a reading of 55.1. This is the lowest reading since February 2014, while business activity is at its worst since August 2012. The US service sector grew more slowing in January than in the previous month, according to the first of the day\u2019s two surveys. Markit\u2019s services PMI for January came in at 53.2 compared to an initial reading of 53.7 and the final December level of 54.3. The composite PMI - which measures both manufacturing and services - fell from 54 in December to 53.2. This is the lowest level since October 2013. More on the prospects of an Opec meeting, from the Wall Street Journal: With oil gaining ground and better than expected private payroll numbers, Wall Street has started the trading day on a positive note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added around 90 points or 0.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.42% and Nasdaq is 0.57% higher. Over in Greece, and journalists are joining in the general wave of protests against proposed pension reforms. Helena Smith reports: The rally, part of a 24-hour strike, comes ahead of tomorrow\u2019s general strike, the third to hit Greece since Syriza was voted back into office in September. Journalists claim that government plans to merge their own pension funds with others is unlawful and counterproductive. Tomorrow\u2019s industrial action will see the entire country come to a grinding halt. Ironically, left wing Syriza has decided to give the strike its blessing and is backing the protests against internationally dictated reforms now creating a storm of reaction across Greece. The country has similarly been paralysed by protesting farmers who have set up roadblocks and sealed off borders nationwide. The weakening of the global economy means conditions have tightened since the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates in December, according to New York Fed president William Dudley. And if such conditions were still in place at the time of its March meeting the Fed would have to take that into consideration, he said. In an interview with MNSI he said the weaker outlook and any further strengthening of the dollar could have \u201cserious consequences\u201d for the health of the US economy. Here are the ADP numbers for the past year: The full report can be found here. Ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers, the ADP private sector payroll survey has shown stronger than expected growth. US employment increased by 205,000 in January compared to forecasts of a 195,000 rise. The December number was revised up to 267,000 from 257,000. Here\u2019s a minor bright spot from Brazil\u2019s PMIs: GlaxoSmithKline has beaten forecasts for its fourth quarter results, helped by growing demand for new drugs helping to offset falling sales of its Advair respiratory treatment. Sales rose 2% while core earnings per share fell 34% to 18.1p - better than the expected 17.9p. Oil is moving higher again on hopes that an agreement between Opec and Russia to cut production might be moving a step closer. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said if there was consensus among Opec and non-Opec producers to meet \u201cthen we will meet,\u201d according to Reuters. He was speaking at a news conference with Oman foreign minister Yusuf bin Alawi who said there was no agreed time for a meeting \u201cbut it will be soon.\u201d We have been here before of course, but these latest comments have helped push Brent crude 1.8% higher to $33.32 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is back above $30, adding 1.87% to $30.44. As a consequence stock markets have recovered from their lows, with the FTSE 100 now down just 0.3% and France\u2019s Cac off 0.24%. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1% however, with banks under pressure. Here\u2019s our report on the better than expected UK service sector survey: Speaking of interest rates the Bank of Japan - which caught markets on the hop last week by introducing negative interest rates - said earlier there were no limits to the measures it could take to boost the economy. Reuters reports: Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank has ample room to expand stimulus further and is prepared to cut interest rates deeper into negative territory, signalling a readiness to act again to hit his ambitious inflation target. Even after deploying what he described as \u201cthe most powerful monetary policy framework in the history of modern central banking,\u201d Kuroda said he remained open to devising new means to revive the economy if existing tools did not work. \u201cIf we judge that existing measures in the toolkit are not enough to achieve (our) goal, what we have to do is to devise new tools,\u201dKuroda said in a speech at a seminar on Wednesday. \u201cI am convinced that there is no limit to measures for monetary easing,\u201d he said. The BOJ chief said although Japan\u2019s economy was recovering moderately, it was taking longer than expected to achieve his 2 percent inflation target due to slumping energy costs. While offering few clues on the trigger for further monetary easing, Kuroda said the recent global markets rout and slowing emerging economies could hurt Japanese business sentiment and discourage firms from boosting wages. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is how (such external risks) could affect confidence,\u201d he said. The Bank of England\u2019s latest interest rate decision is due on Thursday and, despite a slightly better than expected UK services PMI, no one expects any change at the meeting. Even if the pound is moving higher on the back of the figures, it is probably also being influenced by the prospects of Brexit as the referendum looms. Many economists have doubts about whether the Bank will raise rates at all in 2016. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: There can be absolutely no doubt that the Bank of England will keep interest rates down at 0.50% again on Thursday at the conclusion of the February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Whether the Bank of England acts on interest rates at all in 2016 currently looks touch and go. There will most likely be an 8-1 vote again within the MPC for interest rates staying at 0.50%, as there has been repeatedly since last August. While there may well be some speculation that [MPC member Ian] McCafferty could step back from voting for an interest rate hike at the February meeting, we suspect he will stick doggedly to his call Governor Mark Carney\u2019s recent high profile speech indicated that UK growth and inflation since last summer has been weaker than the Bank of England had expected, and the conditions are not in place for an interest rate hike. His speech fuelled the view that the Bank of England could sit tight on interest rates through 2016. Mr. Carney indicated to a Treasury Committee that this is his personal view, so the analysis and forecasts contained in the Quarterly Inflation Report, as well as in the February MPC minutes, will offer insights as to what extent Mr. Carney\u2019s views are shared by the rest of the MPC. While the near-term UK growth and consumer price inflation outlook has weakened, of key importance will be has the Bank of England become more downbeat about the longer-term outlook? Heading into Thursday\u2019s events, we just about believe that one interest rate hike from 0.50% to 0.75% is more likely than not before the end of 2016 \u2013 with November the most likely candidate for action. However, there is clearly a very real possibility that the bank will sit tight until 2017. Our assumption of a November interest rate hike is based on our belief that economic growth will become more solid later on in 2016, earnings growth picks up anew amid a tightening labour market and consumer price inflation trends gradually up. But there are appreciable uncertainties and downside risks to this outlook \u2013 not least the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership, which currently looks like it could take place in June. Further out we expect the Bank of England to only lift interest rates to 1.50% by end-2017 and 2.25% by end-2018. Back with the UK services PMI, and economist Daniel Vernazza at UniCredit Research said the numbers were positive, but talk of economic growth of 0.6% in the first quarter could be a little ambitious: It\u2019s a reassuring number, particularly given the heightened financial market volatility in January that likely adversely impacted the banking and finance sector. Moreover, the more forward-looking new orders and employment indices both accelerated and lie above their long-run average. This resilience in services sector demand is reflected in wider margins, as output price inflation edged up despite a fall in input price inflation. The composite PMI (the weighted average of the services, manufacturing and construction PMIs) rose to a 6-month high and is consistent with quarterly GDP growth of around 0.6% at the turn of the year. However, this is inflated by a surge in the manufacturing output PMI in January that is highly unlikely to last. We continue to expect growth to slow modestly to 0.4% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2016, down from 0.5% quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2015, as the UK faces a number of headwinds ahead, not least the referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the EU that now looks likely to take place in June. Christmas shoppers snapping up food, drinks and tobacco helped push eurozone retail sales up by 0.3% in December compared with November, in line with expectations. Year on year, eurozone retail sales climbed 1.4%, slightly less than the forecast 1.5%, according to Eurostat. In the 28 member European Union, sales rose 0.1% month on month and by 2% year on year. Sterling has reached a three week high of $1.4449 after the stronger than expected services data. The service sector survey suggests the UK economy could grow by around 0.6% in the first quarter, up from the estimated 0.5% in the final quarter of 2015, said Markit Despite the global economic jitters and the floods and storms in the country, the UK services sector unexpectedly grew in January. The Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers index came in at 55.6 last month, up slightly from 55.5 in December and better than the expected dip to 55.3. The stronger than forecast figures come ahead of the latest Bank of England rate decision on Thursday, albeit most economists expect rates to remain on hold for some time yet. And the survey showed companies are concerned about the risks to growth, not least the forthcoming EU referendum. Markit economist Chris Williamson said: The economy defied expectations and picked up speed in January, but cracks continue to appear in the country\u2019s resilience to the various headwinds... Despite the uptick in growth, the increased uncertainty about the outlook and persistent lack of inflationary pressures means the majority of [Bank of England] policymakers will no doubt be more worried about avoiding another downturn than whether the economy needs higher interest rates. The eurozone PMI figures add to the evidence for the European Central Bank to take more stimulus measures at its March meeting, says Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight: The slowdown in services expansion to a 12-month low in January will raise concern that heightened global economic uncertainty and financial market turmoil are weighing down on a reasonably decent but hardly robust Eurozone cyclical upturn. Indeed, with the corresponding manufacturing survey also showing some loss of momentum in January, the purchasing managers\u2019 composite manufacturing and services output index for the Eurozone dipped to a 4-month low of 53.6 in January from 54.3 in December. January\u2019s reading of 53.6 was also below the average of 54.1 seen in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was actually the best quarterly average since the second quarter of 2011; however it was still comfortably above the 50.0 level that indicates flat activity. While there are clearly heightened downside risks to the Eurozone growth outlook from global economic and geopolitical events (which could increasingly weigh down on confidence in the Eurozone as well as hampering exports), for the time being at least we are maintaining our forecast that Eurozone GDP growth will improve to 1.7% in 2016 from an estimated 1.5% in 2015. Appreciable support to Eurozone growth is coming from very low oil and commodity prices, a competitive euro and ECB stimulus (that looks like it will be extended in March). The influx of refugees should also provide overall help to Eurozone growth in 2016, primarily through increased public expenditure. There are also more growth orientated fiscal policies in some countries. Meanwhile, lower unemployment across the Eurozone is supportive to consumer spending along with the boost to purchasing power coming from negligible inflation, although the number of jobless remains relatively high. Meanwhile, the January services and manufacturing PMIs showing slower expansion and deeper overall cuts in prices charged support the case for the ECB to deliver more stimulus at its 10 March policy meeting. China has set a target range for economic growth in 2016, and it is slightly below last year\u2019s objective following the target being missed last year. Bloomberg reports: China set an economic growth target range of 6.5 percent to 7 percent for this year, slower than the objective of about 7 percent in 2015, the head of the country\u2019s top economic planner said. While downward pressure on the economy is \u201crelatively big\u201d in the first quarter, China has the ability to realize such a goal, National Development and Reform Commission Chairman Xu Shaoshi said Wednesday at briefing in Beijing. The country also plans to take steps to curb excess industrial capacity and deal with unprofitable \u201czombie companies,\u201d Xu said. China has many policy tools to deploy, and the central bank\u2019s recent cut to minimum down payments for first time home buyers will help reduce excess housing stock, Xu said. Growth last year slowed to 6.9 percent, the slowest annual pace in a quarter century. President Xi Jinping has said gross domestic product gains in the next five years should average at least 6.5 percent per year to realize the goal of doubling 2010 gross domestic product and per capita income by 2020. Some people are hard to please: Germany\u2019s service sector grew more slowly than expected in January. The Markit services PMI stood at 55 last month, compared to an initial reading of 55.4 and the 56 level seen in December. Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike told Reuters: German service providers remained in expansion mode at the start of 2016. Although output rose to the smallest extent in three months, the underlying rate of growth was robust overall, helped by a further sharp rise in new business. The German composite PMI - which tracks activity in both the manufacturing and services sector - came in at 54.5, in line with earlier estimates but down on December\u2019s 55.5. In France, the service sector returned to growth in January but still showed the effects of the terror attacks in Paris in November. The Markit services PMI rose from 49.8 in December to 50.3, slightly down on a preliminary reading of 50.6. But the increase means the sector moved above the 50 level which indicates growth rather than contraction. The hotel and restaurant sector reported continued weakness in the wake of the Paris attacks, said Markit. Overall the eurozone service and composite PMIs came in much as expected: More on the Italian and Spanish PMIs: Here\u2019s our report on the Syngenta deal. Sean Farrell writes: China National Chemical has offered to buy Syngenta, the Swiss pesticide maker, for more than $43bn (\u00a330bn) in what will be the biggest takeover by a Chinese company. ChemChina, as the state-owned company is known, has courted Syngenta, the world\u2019s largest agribusiness company, since November when it had a proposed $42bn offer rebuffed. The cash takeover, which Syngenta\u2019s board will recommend to shareholders, will heighten the shakeup in the agrochemicals industry after Dow Chemical and DuPont agreed to combine to create a company valued at more than $100bn. The deal, if completed, will make ChemChina, led by its ambitious chairman Ren Jianxin, the world\u2019s biggest producer of pesticides and agrochemicals. It will also support the ambitions of China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to increase output and keep China self sufficient in food production as its growing middle class eats more meat and farmland is turned into housing and golf courses. Full story here: Italy\u2019s service sector also grew in January - for the eleventh month in a row - but at a slower pace than in December. The Markit services PMI dropped to 53.6 in January from 55.3 the previous month, a bigger fall than expected. Analysts had forecast a figure of 54 for January. Here\u2019s Japan\u2019s services numbers from earlier: Despite the raft of service sector data emerging today, Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct says the most important numbers of the day could be the US ADP jobs figures, ahead of the non-farm payroll data on Friday: The key point on the economic calendar today may well be the ADP payroll figures from across the Atlantic. These are something of a curtain raiser ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls and with the US having printed a slew of downbeat data in recent weeks, there\u2019s concern that the Federal Reserve may have moved too quickly with that first rate hike \u2013 today\u2019s number could well be the canary in the coal mine here. The ADP report, which measures private sector payrolls, is expected to show an increase of 190,000, down from December\u2019s bumper figure of 257,000. Spain\u2019s service sector saw a slowdown in growth in January. Markit\u2019s services purchasing managers index came in at 54.6 in January, down from 55.1 in the previous month and the slowest growth rate since December 2014. In early trading, European markets have - as expected - edged lower. The FTSE 100 has fallen 15 points or 0.27% while Germany\u2019s Dax opened down 0.4% and France\u2019s Cac is 0.1% lower. On PMI services day, we\u2019ve already had the Irish data, and it looks positive. The Investec services purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 64 in January from 61.8 in December. Philip O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland, said: Taken together with Monday\u2019s Manufacturing PMI report, this week\u2019s surveys suggest that the strong momentum evident across the Irish economy in 2015 has continued into the New Year. The composite PMI - which measures both manufacturing and services - also moved higher. There may be worries about the state of the Chinese economy but that has not stopped one of its state owned companies making the country\u2019s largest overseas acquisition by a Chinese firm. ChemChina is making an agreed $43bn offer for Swiss seeds and pesticides group Syngenta. Last year US rival Monsanto made an unsuccessful attempt to buy Syngenta. Ahead of what is expected to be another bearish start on the European markets, Mic Mills at Capital Index said: An uneasy Asian session dismissed the surprisingly strong Caixin/Markit Services PMI and HSBC China Composite PMI figures from China overnight as crude oil remained centre stage, with worries of oversupply sending WTI futures back below $30 a barrel. After trading down to last week\u2019s levels of 17070 the Nikkei did manage to claw back some ground...Gold was the biggest winner trading up to 3 month highs as investors seek a safe haven. European markets look set to suffer a weaker open... yesterday\u2019s better than expected employment figures [were] unable to lift the gloom as the continuing glut in oil and fears of a global slowdown seem to outweigh any good news.... Whether decent performances in [the service sector] numbers can help the markets remains a doubt. Mike van Dulken and Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets said the downbeat mood comes despite the better than expected Chinese services data, as well as comments from the Bank of Japan suggesting there was room for more stimulus in the shape of QE or more negative interest rates. European markets are expected to drop back again at the open: Oil prices seem a little more stable after the recent falls. Brent crude is down 0.12% at $32.68 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is up 0.1% at $29.91. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling overage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets continue to come under pressure on renewed fears of a global economic slowdown and a renewed fall in oil prices. Overnight Asian markets have followed a slump on Wall Street as US crude dipped under $30 a barrel again. The Hang Seng ended down 2.9% and the Nikkei is 3.1%. In China, the CSI300 index of the largest listed companies lost 0.43% , while the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.35%. These falls came despite moves by the Chinese government to boost the property market, with a reduction in the minimum deposit for first and second-time home buyers. The day sees a whole raft of service sector data, and China is first out of the blocks. The Caixin services PMI came in at 52.4 in January, up from 50.2 in the previous month. This is the highest since July 2015, but did little to support the markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The weak December reading of 50.2 in stark contrast to the much more bullish official measure had spooked concerns that Chinese consumers were reining back spending in the lead up to Chinese New Year. This morning\u2019s January reading came in at 52.4 a significant improvement on the previous month and in the process rather undermining the argument that concerns about a Chinese slowdown are the primary factors behind the recent bout of equity market jitters. The services sector has been the more resilient of the two main sectors of the global economy over the past few months but there has been a concern that the weakness in manufacturing could cause some ripple out effects into the broader economy, as job losses in manufacturing dent consumer spending and cause a slowdown in the wider economy. The latest services PMI numbers for January from Spain, Italy, France and Germany are broadly expected to remain fairly robust at 54.6, 54.2, 50.6 and 55.4 respectively. The French economy is a particular concern but that isn\u2019t really too much of a surprise given recent events and the fact that the state of emergency is still in place. In the UK, the PMI is expected to come in at around 55.3 but could be lower given the recent floods and severe weather. Here\u2019s the day\u2019s main economic events: 8.45 (GMT) Italian services and composite PMI 8.50 French services and composite PMI 8.55 German services and composite PMI 9.00 Eurozone services and composite PMI 9.30 UK official reserves 9.30 UK services and composite PMI 10.00 Eurozone retail sales 13.15 US ADP employment data 14.45 US Markit services and composite PMI 15.00 ISM non-manufacturing index",

Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said:</p> <blockquote> <p>There can be absolutely no doubt that the Bank of England will keep interest rates down at 0.50% again on Thursday at the conclusion of the February Monetary Policy Committee meeting.</p> <p>Whether the Bank of England acts on interest rates at all in 2016 currently looks touch and go.</p> <p>There will most likely be an 8-1 vote again within the MPC for interest rates staying at 0.50%, as there has been repeatedly since last August. While there may well be some speculation that [MPC member Ian] McCafferty could step back from voting for an interest rate hike at the February meeting, we suspect he will stick doggedly to his call</p> <p>Governor Mark Carney\u2019s recent high profile speech indicated that UK growth and inflation since last summer has been weaker than the Bank of England had expected, and the conditions are not in place for an interest rate hike. His speech fuelled the view that the Bank of England could sit tight on interest rates through 2016. </p> <p>Mr. Carney indicated to a Treasury Committee that this is his personal view, so the analysis and forecasts contained in the Quarterly Inflation Report, as well as in the February MPC minutes, will offer insights as to what extent Mr. Carney\u2019s views are shared by the rest of the MPC. While the near-term UK growth and consumer price inflation outlook has weakened, of key importance will be has the Bank of England become more downbeat about the longer-term outlook? </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad33e932aa51f02f81a3e0ab151eb92c169a9364\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad33e932aa51f02f81a3e0ab151eb92c169a9364/0_0_5760_3458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The committee room where the MPC meets each month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The committee room where the MPC meets each month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Heading into Thursday\u2019s events, we just about believe that one interest rate hike from 0.50% to 0.75% is more likely than not before the end of 2016 \u2013 with November the most likely candidate for action. However, there is clearly a very real possibility that the bank will sit tight until 2017. Our assumption of a November interest rate hike is based on our belief that economic growth will become more solid later on in 2016, earnings growth picks up anew amid a tightening labour market and consumer price inflation trends gradually up.

The influx of refugees should also provide overall help to Eurozone growth in 2016, primarily through increased public expenditure. There are also more growth orientated fiscal policies in some countries. Meanwhile, lower unemployment across the Eurozone is supportive to consumer spending along with the boost to purchasing power coming from negligible inflation, although the number of jobless remains relatively high.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the January services and manufacturing PMIs showing slower expansion and deeper overall cuts in prices charged support the case for the ECB to deliver more stimulus at its 10 March policy meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b1c6a0e4b048ec83a767af\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-03T09:23:58.236Z\">9.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">China expects 6.5% to 7% growth this year</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>China has set a target range for economic growth in 2016, and it is slightly below last year\u2019s objective following the target being missed last year.

      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, has waded into the EU referendum debate, saying that Britain is \u201cmuch better off inside the EU than outside\u201d. Witty backed the prime minister\u2019s efforts to renegotiate the terms of Britain\u2019s EU membership. But whichever way the negotiations go, he stressed the importance of remaining in the European Union. \u201cWe regard Europe as a significant economic bloc, it is important to us from a regulatory perspective, but it also creates some levels of predictability. Could it be improved? Of course it could be improved, we would encourage the government to work hard to improve it, but we believe it is better to be in and improving than to be on the outside and trying to plot a new course,\u201d he said. Witty was speaking after the pharmaceutical company unveiled a 6% rise in 2015 sales to \u00a324bn and stuck to its target to return to double-digit growth in core earnings in 2016, following a 15% decline last year. The company is paying an ordinary dividend of 80p a share and a special dividend of 20p for 2015 and pledged payouts of 80p for 2016 and 2017. While sales of GSK\u2019s asthma drug Advair continue to slide due to generic copies coming on to the market, prescriptions for the new Breo and Anoro inhaled lung drugs have increased in the key US market after a slow start. GSK\u2019s meningitis and other vaccines, along with new HIV drugs and the consumer healthcare business, all performed strongly. Sensodyne toothpaste now makes sales of nearly \u00a31bn a year. Some investors have called for a breakup of the \u00a370bn pharmaceutical group including the fund manager Neil Woodford, who compared its structure to \u201cfour FTSE 100 companies bolted together\u201d. Witty did not rule out spinning off the consumer healthcare division, which is run as a GSK-controlled joint venture with Novartis, but said it would be \u201cunwise\u201d to make a definitive decision now and described it as a question \u201cfor the future, not for today\u201d. He is keen to boost margins first and pointed out that GSK is only in the first year of its three-year turnaround plan following a $20bn (\u00a313.7bn) asset swap with Novartis. Ketan Patel, an associate fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, which owns GSK shares, said: \u201cThe question for long-term investors is whether it makes sense to sell [specialist HIV company] ViiV, the fastest growing business and the consumer healthcare division, which like all GSK businesses uses the same distribution network. The pipeline, with more than 250 products, remains a key driver, but needs to begin to deliver a return for long-suffering investors and fend off calls for a breakup.\u201d GSK, under pressure to replace its portfolio of ageing treatments, made sales of \u00a32bn from new treatments last year and now expects to reach its \u00a36bn target for new product sales by 2018, two years earlier than expected. Witty said GSK is conducting feasibility studies on the rapidly spreading Zika virus, declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organisation. French drugmaker Sanofi announced on Tuesday that it would start work on a vaccine, building on the research it carried out for its recently approved vaccine for dengue fever, another mosquito-borne disease.",

While Britain\u2019s factories enjoyed an upturn in activity last month, construction growth slowed to a nine-month low.

      "bodyText": "China National Chemical has offered to buy Syngenta, the Swiss pesticide maker, for more than $43bn (\u00a330bn) in what will be the biggest takeover by a Chinese company. ChemChina, as the state-owned company is known, has courted Syngenta, the world\u2019s largest agribusiness company, since November when it had a proposed $42bn offer rebuffed. The cash takeover, which Syngenta\u2019s board will recommend to shareholders, will heighten the shakeup in the agrochemicals industry after Dow Chemical and DuPont agreed to combine to create a company valued at more than $100bn. The deal, if completed, will make ChemChina, led by its ambitious chairman Ren Jianxin, the world\u2019s biggest producer of pesticides and agrochemicals. It will also support the ambitions of China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to increase output and keep China self-sufficient in food production as its growing middle class eats more meat and farmland is turned into housing and golf courses. ChemChina plans to keep Syngenta\u2019s management team, including John Ramsay, the chief executive. Ren will chair a board of 10 including four of Syngenta\u2019s existing directors. Syngenta said the deal would give it more scope to expand further in pesticides and to develop its seeds business while getting greater access to emerging markets, in particular China. Michel Demar\u00e9, Syngenta\u2019s chairman, said the takeover did not mean Syngenta would now be controlled by the Chinese government and that ChemChina, which has been on an acquisition spree, understood the importance of giving businesses autonomy. \u201cThis is absolutely not a China nationalisation,\u201d Demar\u00e9 told CNBC. \u201cChemChina has a fantastic track record of having not only bought companies outside of China but also having kept investing in them and developing them and keeping the culture and values in place and I\u2019m absolutely convinced that the same will happen here.\u201d Syngenta\u2019s decision to accept ChemChina\u2019s offer is a setback for Monsanto, the genetically modified seed producer, which has also tried to buy the Basel-based company. Monsanto made an offer valued at almost $47bn for Syngenta last year but that bid was rejected by the Swiss company\u2019s previous management. Monsanto\u2019s offer was in cash and its own shares, whose value has since declined. Demar\u00e9 and Ramsay have faced pressure from shareholders to agree a deal after rebuffing Monsanto. In addition to the $465 a share cash offer from ChemChina, Syngenta shareholders will receive a SFr5 special dividend and an ordinary dividend of SFr11, taking the total value to SFr480 a share, Syngenta said. Ren said: \u201cThe discussions between our two companies have been friendly, constructive and cooperative. We look forward to Michel Demar\u00e9 remaining on the board as vice-chairman and lead independent director, and to working with John Ramsay and the management and employees of Syngenta to deliver safe and reliable solutions for the continued growth in global food demand.\u201d",

The chain made the pledge after a Change.org petition highlighted the disparity between equivalent products marketed at men and women, as it claimed that women are the victims of \u201csexist pricing\u201d on the high street. The petition revealed that Boots eye cream was \u00a39.99 for women and \u00a37.29 for men, while razors were priced at \u00a32.29 for eight women\u2019s razors and \u00a31.49 for a pack of 10 for men. The petition, which attracted 41,790 signatures, urged the chief executive, Simon Roberts, to review the apparent disparity in pricing. In a statement on its website, Boots said it had never operated a pricing system that discriminated against women \u201cso we were surprised and disappointed to see recent examples in the press that did not reflect our own standards\u201d. It said: \u201cWe immediately conducted a review on all Boots own-brand and proprietary ranges to better understand the cited examples. This review has reassured us that for Boots own brands the two reported examples, Boots disposable razors and Botanics eye roll-on, are indeed exceptional cases which do not completely meet our principles and we are taking action to correct these prices. \u201cFollowing the review of Boots own-brand ranges, we are speaking to our suppliers to ask them to conduct similar reviews of their brands, however we cannot comment further on their pricing \u2013 that would be a matter for the brands themselves.\u201d Last month the Times released the results of a survey showing that the cost of clothes, beauty products and toys for females was routinely higher than equivalent items aimed at males. Across all products with different prices, those aimed at women were 37% higher on average, the newspaper said. The equality campaigning group the Fawcett Society welcomed the change, while calling on other retailers to follow suit. The society\u2019s chief executive, Sam Smethers, said: \u201cIt is welcome to see Boots change its sexist pricing practices in response to consumer pressure.\u201d \u201cThis is just the start. We are also hearing from manufacturers who are making it clear that it is the retailers who are responsible for this sexist price discrimination. In other words, the claim that the price difference is because products marketed at women cost more to make is simply not holding up. Women are being ripped off every single day and that has to change.\u201d The chairwoman of the women and equalities committee, Maria Miller, last month raised the prospect of retailers being called to parliament to face questioning about the issue of apparent differences in the prices of products for men and women. \u201cRetailers need to explain how they can be charging such different prices for items that look identical,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an excellent piece of research and it\u2019s something which the committee will be considering whether we should take further.\u201d Differing price tags faced by male and female consumers have also been coming under the spotlight internationally. The New York City department of consumer affairs released a study in December of 800 nearly identical products with male and female versions. The report, entitled From Cradle to Cane: The Cost of Being a Female Consumer, found that, on average, female versions cost 7% more than male. \u201cProducts\u2019 price differences based on gender are largely inescapable for female consumers simply due to the product offerings available in the market,\u201d its authors stated.",

      "bodyText": "Britain is the \u201cmercenary kingpin\u201d of global private military industry, which has been booming ever since the \u201cwar on terror\u201d began 15 years ago, according to a report seen exclusively by the Guardian. The UK multinational G4S is now the world\u2019s largest private security company, and no fewer than 14 companies are based in Hereford, close to the headquarters of the SAS, from whose ranks at least 46 companies hire recruits, says the report by British-based charity War on Want. The huge increase in the number of private military and security companies, with contracts running into billions of pounds, signals the return of the \u201cdogs of war\u201d (mercenary) era that followed the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq, said John Hilary, executive director of War on Want. At the height of the occupation of Iraq, about 80 British companies operated in Iraq; there are now hundreds operating in areas of conflict around the world, bound only by a system of self-regulation. In Libya, UK companies led the way after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the report stated. The Security Contracting Network, a recruitment forum for the industry, posted a message in the days following Gaddafi\u2019s fall saying: \u201cThere will be an uptick of activity as foreign oil companies scramble to get back to Libya \u2026 follow the money, and find your next job.\u201d Leading UK private military company Aegis Defence Services (now part of GardaWorld), Control Risks, and Olive Group are also among the top recruiters. Their senior executives and board are dominated by former military officers, says War on Want. The chief executive of Aegis, for example, is former Gen Graham Binns, one-time commander of British troops in Basra. G4S last year secured a contract of up to \u00a3188m to provide security for the Basrah Gas Company and signed a five-year, \u00a3100m contract with the British embassy in Afghanistan. Clients of G4S, whose annual turnover in Africa has reached \u00a3500m, include Royal Dutch Shell and AngloGold Ashanti, War on Want reports. Foreign Office spending on contracts with private UK security companies rose from \u00a312.6m in 2003 to \u00a348.9m in 2012, according to official figures. The use of private armies and \u201cfloating armouries\u201d by shipping companies is also growing, according to War on Want. Floating armouries are ships harboured at sea, stacked with high-powered rifles, night-vision goggles. More than half of the members of the Security Association for the Maritime Industry (SAMI) are British. Protection Vessels International Ltd, a UK company, describes itself as the \u201cglobal leader in armed maritime security\u201d. It was set up in 2008 by senior former military figures \u201cwith the express purpose of applying military standards of security\u201d, with a team \u201cdrawn from the highest echelons of UK Royal Marines, UK government intelligence and commerce\u201d, War on Want notes. The Guardian has reported how private security companies protecting ships against Somali pirates store their weapons on floating armouries in international waters to avoid arms smuggling laws. In 2013 Whitehall issued 50 licences for floating armouries in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden. Hilary of War on Want said: \u201cPrivate military contractors ran amok in Iraq and Afghanistan, leaving a trail of human rights abuses in their wake. Now we are seeing the alarming rise of mercenaries fighting on the frontline in conflict zones across the world: it is the return of the \u2018dogs of war\u2019.\u201d He added: \u201cFor too long this murky world of guns for hire has been allowed to grow unchecked. In letting the industry regulate itself, the government has failed: only binding regulation will do. The time has come to ban these companies from operating in conflict zones and end the privatisation of war.\u201d Britain has signed up to an international code of conduct for \u201cprivate security service providers\u201d, laying down principles covering accountability to the law and human rights. However, it is a voluntary code of conduct. The UN is drawing up plans for an international convention that is legally binding on private security and military companies. Switzerland bans companies based in the country from operating in conflict zones.",

      "body": "<p>Britain is the \u201cmercenary kingpin\u201d of global private military industry, which has been booming ever since the \u201cwar on terror\u201d began 15 years ago, according to a report seen exclusively by the Guardian.</p> <p>The UK multinational G4S is now the world\u2019s largest private security company, and no fewer than 14 companies are based in Hereford, close to the headquarters of the SAS, from whose ranks at least 46 companies hire recruits, says the report by British-based charity <a href=\"http://www.waronwant.org/\">War on Want</a>. </p> <p>The huge increase in the number of private military and security companies, with contracts running into billions of pounds, signals the return of the \u201cdogs of war\u201d (mercenary) era that followed the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq, said John Hilary, executive director of War on Want.</p> <p>At the height of the occupation of Iraq, about 80 British companies operated in Iraq; there are now hundreds operating in areas of conflict around the world, bound only by a system of self-regulation.</p> <p>In Libya, UK companies led the way after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the report stated. The Security Contracting Network, a recruitment forum for the industry, posted a message in the days following Gaddafi\u2019s fall saying: \u201cThere will be an uptick of activity as foreign oil companies scramble to get back to Libya \u2026 follow the money, and find your next job.\u201d</p> <p>Leading UK private military company Aegis Defence Services (now part of GardaWorld), Control Risks, and Olive Group are also among the top recruiters. Their senior executives and board are dominated by former military officers, says War on Want. The chief executive of Aegis, for example, is former Gen Graham Binns, one-time commander of British troops in Basra.</p> <p>G4S last year secured a contract of up to \u00a3188m to provide security for the Basrah Gas Company and signed a five-year, \u00a3100m contract with the British embassy in Afghanistan. Clients of G4S, whose annual turnover in Africa has reached \u00a3500m, include Royal Dutch Shell and AngloGold Ashanti, War on Want reports.</p> <p>Foreign Office spending on contracts with private UK security companies rose from \u00a312.6m in 2003 to \u00a348.9m in 2012, according to official figures.</p> <p>The use of private armies and \u201cfloating armouries\u201d by shipping companies is also growing, according to War on Want. Floating armouries are ships harboured at sea, stacked with high-powered rifles, night-vision goggles.</p> <p>More than half of the members of the Security Association for the Maritime Industry (SAMI) are British. Protection Vessels International Ltd, a UK company, describes itself as the \u201cglobal leader in armed maritime security\u201d. It was set up in 2008 by senior former military figures \u201cwith the express purpose of applying military standards of security\u201d, with a team \u201cdrawn from the highest echelons of UK Royal Marines, UK government intelligence and commerce\u201d, War on Want notes.</p> <p>The Guardian has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/10/pirate-weapons-floating-armouries\">reported</a> how private security companies protecting ships against Somali pirates store their weapons on floating armouries in international waters to avoid arms smuggling laws. In 2013 Whitehall issued 50 licences for floating armouries in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden. </p> <p>Hilary of War on Want said: \u201cPrivate military contractors ran amok in Iraq and Afghanistan, leaving a trail of human rights abuses in their wake. Now we are seeing the alarming rise of mercenaries fighting on the frontline in conflict zones across the world: it is the return of the \u2018dogs of war\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cFor too long this murky world of guns for hire has been allowed to grow unchecked. In letting the industry regulate itself, the government has failed: only binding regulation will do. The time has come to ban these companies from operating in conflict zones and end the privatisation of war.\u201d</p> <p>Britain has signed up to an international code of conduct for \u201cprivate security service providers\u201d, laying down principles covering accountability to the law and human rights. However, it is a voluntary code of conduct. </p> <p>The UN is drawing up plans for an international convention that is legally binding on private security and military companies. Switzerland bans companies based in the country from operating in conflict zones.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Turnbull government\u2019s budget forecasts will blow out by $9.6bn over the next four years, or $44.7bn within a decade, if it fails to clinch parliamentary approval for stalled savings measures, new figures show. A report by the independent parliamentary budget office (PBO) reveals the cumulative impact of measures that are yet to pass parliament but are already factored into the budget bottom line. The shortfall is much smaller than a previous estimate in September last year but remains substantial. Wednesday\u2019s report emboldened the government\u2019s political opponents, who argued it showed the flimsy state of the deficit forecasts and also proved many Tony Abbott-era cuts remained on the agenda. The figures also illustrate the Coalition\u2019s continuing difficulties in the Senate, as the government considers changes to electoral laws to counter the impact of micro-parties before the next election. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said last week the government was trying to make \u201cprudent\u201d savings but \u201cone of our challenges is that so many of them are being blocked in the Senate\u201d. Scott Morrison\u2019s budget update in December predicted an underlying cash deficit of $37.4bn this financial year, adding up to deficits of $108.3bn over the four-year cycle. But the PBO report indicates the deficit figures would be $9.6bn worse over four years if the treasurer\u2019s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook had not assumed the passage of a raft of contentious savings measures. The PBO\u2019s list of outstanding measures included the Coalition\u2019s higher education overhaul, its family payment cuts, its proposed increase in copayments for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the abolition of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. It also included one Julia Gillard-era measure: the university efficiency dividend that Labor now opposes. The Greens MP Adam Bandt said the government should devise \u201ca plan B that had a chance of passing the Senate, instead of sticking with unfair measures that will grow the gap between rich and poor\u201d. \u201cThe PBO report released today shows that the treasurer\u2019s pigheadedness will blow out the deficit by almost $45bn,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of continuing Tony Abbott\u2019s attacks on the young, the old, the sick and the poor that will increase inequality in this country, Scott Morrison should end the billions of dollars a year spent on unfair tax breaks that benefit the very wealthy.\u201d Labor issued a series of media releases accusing the government of maintaining \u201cits attacks on renewable energy\u201d, pushing ahead with the \u201cAmericanisation of Australian universities\u201d and clinging to \u201cbillions of dollars in further health cuts\u201d. The opposition\u2019s families spokeswoman, Jenny Macklin, said the report also showed the government\u2019s policy to stop so-called \u201cdouble dipping\u201d in paid parental leave would shave $3.7bn from the system over a decade. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, in turn accused Labor of \u201cstanding in our way at every turn stopping the necessary fixing of many of the budget problems they left behind\u201d and compounding the problem with new \u201cmultibillion-dollar spending promises\u201d \u201cAs a country we are still working to digest Labor\u2019s last spending binge during their last period in office,\u201d Cormann said. The PBO routinely updates its estimates of unlegislated budget items but this time it included the underlying cash balance \u2013 the measure generally cited in public debates about deficit and surplus. When considered on the same basis as previous PBO reports \u2013 fiscal balance \u2013 the unlegislated measures now amount to $9.2bn over four years or $36.5bn over the decade to 2025-26. This reflects a turnaround from the previous such report, published in September 2015, when the fiscal balance shortfall was assessed to be about $18bn over four years or $74bn over a decade.",

A study by a group of Sydney academics sent testers of the same age and sex to more than 350 inspections in the Sydney housing market and found that Indian and Middle Eastern people were disadvantaged by most measures compared with people of Caucasian appearance. Members of ethnic minorities are less likely to be offered individual appointments to view properties and be told important information such as deadlines for rental applications. Agents favoured white renters by telling them but not ethnic minorities about other housing in 26.8% of cases. Only 7% of ethnic renters received this preferential treatment. Agents also gave preferential treatment to white people by giving further information about applications (by a difference of 16.2%), having \u201coff script\u201d discussions with them (by a difference of 12.8%) and asking them about their housing needs (by 10%).

MacDonald said that, despite the unfavourable treatment, ethnic testers reported agents were \u201cwarm and friendly\u201d to them and it was \u201cvery unclear to any of them that they\u2019d been discriminated against\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to determine how your experience is different from others, so if the system relies on complaints of discrimination you\u2019re going to underestimate how often it happens,\u201d she said. The president of the Real Estate Institute of NSW, John Cunningham, said it was \u201ctaking the report seriously\u201d because it had a \u201creasonably good sample group [from which] to draw conclusions\u201d. Cunningham said it was clear there could be more training on racial discrimination but it was a matter for the regulator, NSW Fair Trading, to improve the compliance and regulatory framework. Mandatory training to gain and hold a real estate licence did not cover compliance with discrimination law, he said. \u201cWhen you get reports like this, they\u2019re good alarm bell ringers,\u201d he said. The NSW Residential Tenancies Act and regulations do not deal with discrimination but NSW and federal anti-discrimination laws make it unlawful for a landlord or agent to discriminate by providing an inferior service based on grounds including race. NSW Fair Trading refers people who believe they have been discriminated against to the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board. In August 2015 NSW Fair Trading signed a memorandum of understanding with the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board for the agencies to conduct joint trader education visits and inspections focusing on discrimination issues. The two agencies will also identify \u201cpotential problem traders\u201d. Felicity Huntington from the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board said it was difficult to know the extent of discrimination because people were reluctant to lodge a formal complaint. Huntington said the Anti-Discrimination Board did explain discrimination law to agents as part of continuing professional development delivered by NSW Fair Trading. \u201cI hope ... since we\u2019ve got the MOU signed we can make some changes to hopefully get real estate agents to do the right thing and not just judge people by appearances or by their names and write them off,\u201d Huntington said. A paper on the study, Rental Discrimination in the Multi-Ethnic Metropolis: Evidence from Sydney, will be published in academic journal Urban Policy and Research.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s housing crisis can only be solved if the government switches to a capital gains tax on homes, according to a report. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) warned that prices would continue to rocket, pricing first-time buyers out of the market, while property was lightly taxed compared with other assets that investors can buy. Buyers need to find a deposit of \u00a380,000 to afford an average home, after a 50% rise in prices over the past decade. The thinktank also urged ministers to end their reliance on private sector housebuilders, which it said could never meet the demands for affordable homes to rent or buy. The hard-hitting report will sting George Osborne, who has said his reforms of stamp duty on property transactions would cool the market and reduce speculation from buy-to-let landlords. The chancellor\u2019s higher charges on the purchase of expensive homes have affected sales of properties worth more than \u00a35m, but have so far done little to deter buy-to-let investors from outbidding first-time buyers. Angus Armstrong, a senior economist at Niesr, said damaging trends in the property market needed to be tackled to prevent it from undermining the UK\u2019s sustainable growth. Booms and busts in the UK housing market are the worst in the developed world, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The worst trends highlighted in the report were: More houses being bought for investment purposes, raising the cost of housing The older generation \u201cunderoccupying\u201d and even \u201choarding\u201d property The number of new homes being built being lower than the number of new families The reclassification of housing association property as part of the public sector, making it harder for social landlords to access long-term, stable funding \u201cA first priority must be to improve the taxation of housing. An efficient tax system would be consistent across assets and leave the decision about how much to consume today versus save and consume tomorrow unaffected,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cIf a capital gains tax were introduced, this would reduce the gains in an upturn and losses in a downturn, so dampening house price cycles. These ideas are unfortunately in the opposite direction to recent policies.\u201d A growing number of economists have argued for an annual tax on land and property to end what many have called the UK\u2019s addiction to property speculation. The boom in buy- to-let since the late 1990s, when banks relaxed their criteria for offering commercial mortgage loans, has also fuelled speculation by investors. House prices have increased by a total of 50% in the last 10 years, despite a 20% fall following the 2008 banking crash. The value of households\u2019 and non-profit institutions\u2019 dwellings was \u00a34.43tn in 2014 \u2013 58% of the entire net wealth of the UK. With the rise in value and number of buy-to-let properties, estate agent Savills have estimated, landlords with mortgages now have more housing market equity than owner-occupiers with mortgages. Armstrong said rising property prices meant that the UK was suffering a period of intergenerational unfairness, largely driven by the hoarding of bigger homes by older households. \u201cThe 50% rise in house prices over the past decade benefits the existing owners at the cost of those wanting to become owners,\u201d he said. \u201cThe younger generation, perhaps simply not old enough to own in 2004, now have to save 50% more from after-tax income just to afford an average UK home.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 February 2016. An earlier version said the National Institute of Economic and Social Research had advocated an annual capital gains tax on homes; it advocated a tax applied on the sale of a home.",
