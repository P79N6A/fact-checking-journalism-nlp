      "bodyText": "This budget looks set not only to be replete with spending commitments and tax cuts, but also to be the final nail in the coffin of the Liberal party\u2019s scare mongering about the evils of debt and deficit. A few weeks ago, I suggested that because of unexpected increases in taxation revenue and with an election due in the next 12 months, the budget would see the treasurer \u201cdoling out the pork\u201d. Two days later, the leader of the National party rather confirmed this by referring to the treasurer in an interview with the Daily Telegraph as \u201cScott Santa Claus Morrison\u201d. Morrison quickly tried to dampen these expectations but the cat was well and truly out of the bag, and since then all the pre-budget drops have been about new spending or tax cuts with little sense of the need for restraint. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday This has actually brought with it some problems for the government as they discard what they once told us were sacredly held beliefs. Last year, Morrison for example, was adamant that the NDIS needed to be fully funded, and could only be done so by raising the Medicare levy a half a per cent. He did this, he told the nation, because \u201cit\u2019s time ... we give disabled Australians and their families the guarantee they deserve\u201d. But now? Guarantees? Pfft. That\u2019s so 2017, we have a strong economy, don\u2019t you know! Morrison told the Today Show\u2019s Karl Stefanovic this week that, \u201cI\u2019m pleased as punch for people with disabilities that we can guarantee them those funds from a stronger economy\u201d. You would have to be as dumb as Punch to believe a strong economy is guaranteed. The point of the Medicare levy increase was that the NDIS is not some one-off project. It is ongoing \u2013 when the economy is doing well and when it is not. Now Morrison would have us believe the economy will always be doing well. The only reason the government has dumped the Medicare levy increase is because back in 2016 it had imposed a dopey cap on tax revenue of 23.9% of GDP. So great is the influx of revenue coming via improved export prices and employment growth that it looked set to break through this cap in the next few years \u2013 and thus they needed to reduce the tax take. But why not just bank that money and reduce the deficit and government debt?After all, that was what Morrison said he would do in last year\u2019s budget. Now, instead, extra revenue will be spent \u2013 or foregone as is the case with the rescinding Medicare levy increase. This is what happens when your budget policy is framed more by politics than economics. There is not one iota of evidence that the economy suffers if tax revenue goes above 23.9% of GDP. When tax revenue rises it does so for pretty much one reason only \u2013 the economy is doing well. That is why in 2004-05 and 2005-06 at the height of the mining boom, tax revenue was equivalent to 24.3% of GDP. And that is why when you do get an unexpected influx of revenue, blowing it on tax cuts is about the dumbest thing you can do, because while you might be able to afford it while things are unexpectedly doing well, you cannot when things are unexpectedly doing poorly. And no one ever expects the economy to do poorly. In Peter Costello\u2019s last budget in 2007, the Treasury predicted that \u201cthe world economy is expected to continue to expand at a strong rate\u201d and that \u201cgrowth in the United States is expected to ease in 2007, before strengthening in 2008\u201d. Instead it went backwards into the deepest recession since the second world war. Morrison\u2019s position also highlights just how hollow is the Liberal party\u2019s talk on debt and deficit. During the Rudd-Gillard years the cries about rising government debt were unending. And yet government net debt is now higher than it has ever been and five years into government, the Liberal party are yet to deliver a budget deficit smaller than it was in 2012-13. Now that isn\u2019t to say the government should have been reducing the deficit or debt faster than they have \u2013 it just highlights how stupid it is to make debt and deficits your key measures. The reality is both are important but are subject to the requirements of the economy. When the economy is weak and tax revenue is low, cutting spending to get back to surplus is a fool\u2019s errand that is only good if you believe the country should experience a recession. Morrison, like Joe Hockey (and Costello) before him, has discovered that the path to a budget surplus is paved with revenue growth, not spending cuts. But now that he has the revenue of which Wayne Swan could have only dreamed, the desire for a surplus, or to reduce debt, has become less important. In the 2014-15 budget, the government planned for a budget surplus of \u201cat least 1% of GDP by 2023\u201124\u201d. That was a bit too specific for Morrison, who last year watered-down the commitment to \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Now that \u201cas soon as possible\u201d is, as Morrison told reporters this week, \u201cconditioned by ensuring taxes do not rise more than 23.9% of the economy.\u201d You could argue given the current low inflation and income growth that the economy is not actually strong enough for a faster return to surplus than previously planned. But Morrison is not making that case. For him the economy is strong \u2013 and will ever be so. He is just using the 23.9% line as an excuse for dolling out tax cuts because an election is coming. It\u2019s about politics, not economics. And it reveals just how disingenuous the Liberal party\u2019s decade-long preaching on the evil of debt and deficit has been. And that should never be forgotten. Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "\u2018The left and the right don\u2019t know how to respond to President Macron\u2019s reform agenda,\u201d said a former senior trade union official. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing doesn\u2019t fit with the way we think about politics. It\u2019s not like the third-way politics championed by Tony Blair. \u201cIt is based on empowerment of the individual \u2013 which threatens the left \u2013 and on the deployment of the state to invest and drive through reforms \u2013 which upsets the right. Neither has found a language or an alternative agenda with which to confront him.\u201d Tomorrow, France\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, will meet trade union leaders in an attempt to defuse a row that is seen as an important test of France\u2019s appetite for change. Plans to strip train drivers of their many privileges, including retirement at 52, were backed by France\u2019s lower house of parliament earlier this year, which set MPs on a collision course with one of the most powerful blocs of workers in Europe. Strikes began last month and are set to run until July in a bid to force a U-turn. President Emmanuel Macron, 40, has said he will pursue the reforms \u201cto the end\u201d, and polls say most French voters are behind him. An Ifop poll last week found that only 41% of French people consider the train drivers\u2019 industrial action justified, a drop on a survey the previous week. Other polls have suggested the same, but some with a closer margin for and against. Yet there is anger across the spectrum about the speed at which changes are being implemented, and the implications for European Union elections next year and local elections in 2020, now that Marine Le Pen\u2019s Front National has become a mainstream protest vehicle. The shake-up of pension arrangements for state rail operator SNCF affects almost 200,000 employees. According to Macron\u2019s manifesto, that is just the start. He has plans to fold 40-odd employer and state pension schemes into one, potentially asking millions to give up benefits and privileges negotiated over many decades. Alain Duhamel, a political commentator, said Macron had \u201ctaken a great risk by starting with a whole series of reforms which weren\u2019t popular even before this social turnaround\u201d. He told RTL radio: \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is the metamorphosis of SNCF, a national company that is the most symbolic in France.\u201d The president, he added, had to avoid a \u201ccoagulation of conflicts\u201d. This \u201ccoagulation\u201d has been a recurrent fear among French governments since the riots of May 1968. Georgina Wright of the Chatham House thinktank said Macron feared his powers might evaporate quickly were the coalition he formed from his fledgling party and mainly right-of-centre rivals to break apart. \u201cHis majority in the lower house is just 23. So he has pushed hard while the majority is still in place. He also needs to deliver on some of his pledges and see results quickly. For instance he wants to cut 50,000 public sector jobs in his first term, but critics have been quick to point out that only 1,600 have gone so far, and many of those were contracts, not full-time posts.\u201d One example of the way Macron has confused opponents is the legislation passed in January that allows citizens the \u201cright to make a mistake\u201d when dealing with the state without being sanctioned. Only one error is allowed and it must be made \u201cin good faith\u201d, but the intent is to push back against bureaucratic control. Businesses and individuals have long complained about the unresponsive French state. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to get a state worker on the phone, and when you do, they just say non,\u201d an unnamed official said last week. This droit \u00e0 l\u2019erreur is viewed as a gimmick by some, but to Macron it is the cornerstone of a wider attempt to foster a \u201ctrusting society\u201d and simplify bureaucracy. Government departments are seen as sclerotic institutions that don\u2019t talk to each other and are staffed by blinkered civil servants who, unlike their British counterparts, rarely change departments. This may smack in some ways of Blairism, and there are similarities in Macron\u2019s urge to support entrepreneurs with tax cuts and a more flexible labour market. He also wants to open up higher education and push some of France\u2019s moribund universities into international rankings dominated by US and UK institutions. Chlo\u00eb Morin, director of the Opinion Observatory at left-leaning thinktank the Jean Jaur\u00e8s Foundation, said opinion polls showed Macron\u2019s support wavering in some income groups: \u201cThe more people earn, the higher the support for Macron. This shows a polarisation of French society in terms of opinion.\u201d Morin argues that Macron is in danger of being seen as \u201cunfair\u201d, not so much because of his attack on SNCF workers, but more in his wealth tax and pension reforms. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that it benefits exclusively the rich, but also criticism of the method, a sense that he is inflexible, rigid and doesn\u2019t listen. We are hearing this more and more: that he doesn\u2019t listen but is set on imposing his model.\u201d The SNCF dispute has been contagious, sparking industrial action at Air France and among refuse collectors, hospital workers and teachers. Only 8% of France\u2019s workforce is unionised, but the unions \u2013 especially the Conf\u00e9deration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail (CGT) \u2013 punch above their weight. What\u2019s worse for the president is that the left likens him not to Tony Blair, but to Margaret Thatcher, a despised figure in France. Alexis Corbi\u00e8re, of leftist party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), said the government\u2019s response to the SNCF crisis had a Thatcherite feel: \u201cHe\u2019s a bit Margaret Macron \u2026 there\u2019s a certain contempt for union organisations and the train drivers.\u201d He said the striking drivers were \u201cheroes fighting for a public service\u201d. Former Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande accused Macron of hitting the poor while helping the rich. \u201cThis deepening inequality is a major problem \u2026 My governments reduced inequalities; this one is increasing them.\u201d Even some who support the SNCF reforms are critical of Macron. Laurence Sailliet of the centre-right Les R\u00e9publicains said: \u201cThe method is bad: there\u2019s a lot of arrogance from the president \u2026 and from members of the government who keep playing the big guns and haven\u2019t realised that the unions can be a blocking force.\u201d Speaking to journalists before a meeting with the prime minister tomorrow, Laurent Berger, head of France\u2019s other large union, the CFDT, said: \u201cI hope he will listen to us. The solution to the conflict is first of all that the trains begin rolling normally again but also that the drivers don\u2019t feel humiliated. We don\u2019t need people showing their muscle, but people who will discuss the real issues.\u201d The moderate CFDT has overtaken the leftist CGT in recent years to become France\u2019s biggest union by member numbers. For Macron, the sense that old-style radicalism \u2013 represented by the CGT, with its tyre burning and secondary picketing \u2013 is dying, is hugely helpful. The former union official summed it up: \u201cFrench people are ready to make sacrifices if they think their children\u2019s future will be improved. As long as unemployment keeps falling, job opportunities increase and the extra funds for education and training make a difference, he has a good chance of deflecting claims that he\u2019s a president for the rich.\u201d Five things Macron wants to change Taxation Macron\u2019s reputation as a president for the rich was burnished by the cut in wealth tax pushed through last year and effective from January. A tax introduced in the 1980s on savings, investment and property was limited by Macron to just property. Like its predecessor, the tax has a sliding scale from 0.5% annual surcharge on real estate worth \u20ac1.3m to 1.5% on properties worth more than \u00a310m. Revenues to the government are expected to fall from \u20ac5bn to \u20ac2bn. But the plan is also about mimicking the UK by consolidating several charges on savings and investments into one capital gains tax at 30% (the UK\u2019s non-property CGT is 20%). Copying the trend across the developed world, corporation tax, currently 15% on profits of \u20ac38,120, 28% up to \u20ac75,000 and 33.3% on above \u20ac75,000, will by 2020 apply to all firms at a rate of 28% before falling to 25% in 2022 (the UK is due to cut the current 19% rate to 18% in 2020). Union power Nothing in Macron\u2019s plans comes near the anti-union legislation brought in by Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s. But big unions such as the CGT dislike new rules allowing workers in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to negotiate their own agreements. The government says 96% of SMEs do not have union reps. Firms with 11-50 staff can strike a deal with a non-unionised rep. Firms with fewer than 20 employees can organise a referendum, though changes to terms and conditions will need a two-thirds majority. To end the lottery of compensation claims for unfair dismissal, Macron will set a mandatory sliding scale for damages, from three months\u2019 salary after two years of service to 20 months\u2019 salary after 30 years. Appeals must be lodged within a year rather than two. Business regulations When a company hires its 50th employee, it faces a series of obligations, including the nomination of workers\u2019 representatives to a works council and a health and safety committee. Under proposed changes, the three groups will be folded into a single social and economic committee, though separate health and safety committees will remain in high-risk sectors. Short-term job contracts A large underbelly of France\u2019s workforce is on short-term contracts, which are routinely renewed. This helps employers avoid the protections offered by long-term contracts, which include a 35-hour working week. Macron wants to move away from this to industry-based rules set by representatives from each sector. The government hopes that incentives to work beyond 35 hours, which are much used already, and reformed dismissal terms will make the system more flexible. Public finances Macron needs to finance his reforms and has signalled to Brussels that he may bust budget spending limits in the short term. A version of austerity-lite has shaved a few euros from student benefits and capped rises in some welfare schemes. But even a modest proposal such as cutting 150,000 civil servants from the 5.3 million total has been met with resistance.",

It\u2019s not like the third-way politics championed by Tony Blair.</p> <p>\u201cIt is based on empowerment of the individual \u2013 which threatens the left \u2013 and on the deployment of the state to invest and drive through reforms \u2013 which upsets the right. Neither has found a language or an alternative agenda with which to confront him.\u201d</p> <p>Tomorrow, France\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, will meet trade union leaders in an attempt to defuse a row that is seen as an important test of France\u2019s appetite for change.</p> <p>Plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/26/emmanuel-macron-takes-on-french-unions-to-cut-rail-workers-rights\">strip train drivers of their many privileges,</a> including retirement at 52, were backed by France\u2019s lower house of parliament earlier this year, which set MPs on a collision course with one of the most powerful blocs of workers in Europe. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/04/french-government-stands-firm-strikes-cause-railway-chaos\">Strikes began last month</a> and are set to run until July in a bid to force a U-turn.</p> <p>President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/emmanuel-macron-deserves-credit-for-global-vision\">Emmanuel Macron</a>, 40, has said he will pursue the reforms \u201cto the end\u201d, and polls say most French voters are behind him. An Ifop poll last week found that only 41% of French people consider the train drivers\u2019 industrial action justified, a drop on a survey the previous week.

According to Macron\u2019s manifesto, that is just the start. He has plans to fold 40-odd employer and state pension schemes into one, potentially asking millions to give up benefits and privileges negotiated over many decades.</p> <p>Alain Duhamel, a political commentator, said Macron had \u201ctaken a great risk by starting with a whole series of reforms which weren\u2019t popular even before this social turnaround\u201d. He told RTL radio: \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is the metamorphosis of SNCF, a national company that is the most symbolic in France.\u201d The president, he added, had to avoid a \u201ccoagulation of conflicts\u201d. This \u201ccoagulation\u201d has been a recurrent fear among French governments since the riots of May 1968.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Georgina Wright of the Chatham House thinktank said Macron feared his powers might evaporate quickly were the coalition he formed from his fledgling party and mainly right-of-centre rivals to break apart. \u201cHis majority in the lower house is just 23. So he has pushed hard while the majority is still in place. He also needs to deliver on some of his pledges and see results quickly. For instance he wants to cut 50,000 public sector jobs in his first term, but critics have been quick to point out that only 1,600 have gone so far, and many of those were contracts, not full-time posts.\u201d</p> <p>One example of the way Macron has confused opponents is the legislation passed in January that allows citizens the \u201cright to make a mistake\u201d when dealing with the state without being sanctioned. Only one error is allowed and it must be made \u201cin good faith\u201d, but the intent is to push back against bureaucratic control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68db774df2c06ee60ba654aa26e5c4476907dfb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68db774df2c06ee60ba654aa26e5c4476907dfb5/0_224_5665_3399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The gare Saint-Lazare in Paris during a two-day strike over plans to overhaul the heavily indebted train operator SNCF.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The gare Saint-Lazare in Paris during a two-day strike over plans to overhaul the heavily indebted train operator SNCF.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Lopez/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Businesses and individuals have long complained about the unresponsive French state. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to get a state worker on the phone, and when you do, they just say <em>non</em>,\u201d an unnamed official said last week.</p> <p>This <em>droit \u00e0 l\u2019erreur</em> is viewed as a gimmick by some, but to Macron it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/24/french-parliament-passes-law-giving-citizens-the-right-to-make-mistakes\">the cornerstone of a wider attempt</a> to foster a \u201ctrusting society\u201d and simplify bureaucracy. Government departments are seen as sclerotic institutions that don\u2019t talk to each other and are staffed by blinkered civil servants who, unlike their British counterparts, rarely change departments.</p> <p>This may smack in some ways of Blairism, and there are similarities in Macron\u2019s urge to support entrepreneurs with tax cuts and a more flexible labour market. He also wants to open up higher education and push some of France\u2019s moribund universities into international rankings dominated by US and UK institutions.</p> <p>Chlo\u00eb Morin, director of the Opinion Observatory at left-leaning thinktank the Jean Jaur\u00e8s Foundation, said opinion polls showed Macron\u2019s support wavering in some income groups: \u201cThe more people earn, the higher the support for Macron. This shows a polarisation of French society in terms of opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Morin argues that Macron is in danger of being seen as \u201cunfair\u201d, not so much because of his attack on SNCF workers, but more in his wealth tax and pension reforms. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that it benefits exclusively the rich, but also criticism of the method, a sense that he is inflexible, rigid and doesn\u2019t listen. We are hearing this more and more: that he doesn\u2019t listen but is set on imposing his model.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2018-05-04T17:21:34/embed.html\" data-alt=\"unemployment in france\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2018-05-04T17:21:34/embed.html\">unemployment in france</a> </figure>  <p>The SNCF dispute has been contagious, sparking industrial action at Air France and among refuse collectors, hospital workers and teachers. Only 8% of France\u2019s workforce is unionised, but the unions \u2013 especially the Conf\u00e9deration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail (CGT) \u2013 punch above their weight.</p> <p>What\u2019s worse for the president is that the left likens him not to Tony Blair, but to Margaret Thatcher, a despised figure in France.</p> <p>Alexis Corbi\u00e8re, of leftist party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), said the government\u2019s response to the SNCF crisis had a Thatcherite feel: \u201cHe\u2019s a bit Margaret Macron \u2026 there\u2019s a certain contempt for union organisations and the train drivers.\u201d He said the striking drivers were \u201cheroes fighting for a public service\u201d.</p> <p>Former Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande accused Macron of hitting the poor while helping the rich. \u201cThis deepening inequality is a major problem \u2026 My governments reduced inequalities; this one is increasing them.\u201d</p> <p>Even some who support the SNCF reforms are critical of Macron. Laurence Sailliet of the centre-right Les R\u00e9publicains said: \u201cThe method is bad: there\u2019s a lot of arrogance from the president \u2026 and from members of the government who keep playing the big guns and haven\u2019t realised that the unions can be a blocking force.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to journalists before a meeting with the prime minister tomorrow, Laurent Berger, head of France\u2019s other large union, the CFDT, said: \u201cI hope he will listen to us. The solution to the conflict is first of all that the trains begin rolling normally again but also that the drivers don\u2019t feel humiliated. We don\u2019t need people showing their muscle, but people who will discuss the real issues.\u201d</p> <p>The moderate CFDT has overtaken the leftist CGT in recent years to become France\u2019s biggest union by member numbers. For Macron, the sense that old-style radicalism \u2013 represented by the CGT, with its tyre burning and secondary picketing \u2013 is dying, is hugely helpful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd2c74b6432d6b83741bd72c086eeb9e3c976ec4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd2c74b6432d6b83741bd72c086eeb9e3c976ec4/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Even some on the centre-right of French politics have been critical of the president\u2019s reforms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Even some on the centre-right of French politics have been critical of the president\u2019s reforms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The former union official summed it up: \u201cFrench people are ready to make sacrifices if they think their children\u2019s future will be improved. As long as unemployment keeps falling, job opportunities increase and the extra funds for education and training make a difference, he has a good chance of deflecting claims that he\u2019s a president for the rich.\u201d</p> <h2>Five things Macron wants to change</h2> <p><strong>Taxation</strong><br>Macron\u2019s reputation as a president for the rich was burnished by the cut in wealth tax pushed through last year and effective from January. A tax introduced in the 1980s on savings, investment and property was limited by Macron to just property. Like its predecessor, the tax has a sliding scale from 0.5% annual surcharge on real estate worth \u20ac1.3m to 1.5% on properties worth more than \u00a310m. Revenues to the government are expected to fall from \u20ac5bn to \u20ac2bn. But the plan is also about mimicking the UK by consolidating several charges on savings and investments into <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-france-tax/macron-fights-president-of-the-rich-tag-after-ending-wealth-tax-idUKKCN1C82DG\">one capital gains tax at 30%</a> (the UK\u2019s non-property CGT is 20%).</p> <p>Copying the trend across the developed world, corporation tax, currently 15% on profits of \u20ac38,120, 28% up to \u20ac75,000 and 33.3% on above \u20ac75,000, will by 2020 apply to all firms at a rate of 28% before falling to 25% in 2022 (the UK is due to cut the current 19% rate to 18% in 2020).</p> <p><strong>Union power</strong><br>Nothing in Macron\u2019s plans comes near the anti-union legislation brought in by Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/31/france-reveals-measures-to-overhaul-working-life\">But big unions such as the CGT dislike new rules</a> allowing workers in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to negotiate their own agreements. The government says 96% of SMEs do not have union reps. Firms with 11-50 staff can strike a deal with a non-unionised rep. Firms with fewer than 20 employees can organise a referendum, though changes to terms and conditions will need a two-thirds majority.</p> <p>To end the lottery of compensation claims for unfair dismissal, Macron will set a mandatory sliding scale for damages, from three months\u2019 salary after two years of service to 20 months\u2019 salary after 30 years. Appeals must be lodged within a year rather than two.</p> <p><strong>Business regulations</strong><br>When a company hires its 50th employee, it faces a series of obligations, including the nomination of workers\u2019 representatives to a works council and a health and safety committee. Under proposed changes, the three groups will be folded into a single social and economic committee, though separate health and safety committees will remain in high-risk sectors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50ce366c3d784c2563c5f07e8784012471758766\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50ce366c3d784c2563c5f07e8784012471758766/0_234_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SNCF employees and CGT labour union members stage a protest in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">SNCF employees and CGT labour union members stage a protest in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benoit Tessier/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Short-term job contracts</strong><br>A large underbelly of France\u2019s workforce is on short-term contracts, which are routinely renewed. This helps employers avoid the protections offered by long-term contracts, which include a 35-hour working week. Macron wants to move away from this to industry-based rules set by representatives from each sector. The government hopes that incentives to work beyond 35 hours, which are much used already, and reformed dismissal terms will make the system more flexible.</p> <p><strong>Public finances</strong><br>Macron needs to finance his reforms and has signalled to Brussels that he may bust budget spending limits in the short term. A version of austerity-lite has shaved a few euros from student benefits and capped rises in some welfare schemes. But even a modest proposal such as cutting 150,000 civil servants from the 5.3 million total has been met with resistance.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The rise of the gaming console has left its mark on living rooms and bedrooms around Britain \u2013 but it has also hit the high street. There were around 1,000 amusement arcades in the UK in the 1980s, but that number had halved by 2011, according to the amusements industry trade body, Bacta. Now, the next generation of gaming \u2013 virtual reality \u2013 is once again making the arcade the prime venue for playing cutting-edge games. Back at the inception of gaming, fans went to video-game arcades. Japanese coin-operated games like Out Run and Street Fighter managed to draw in players once Pac-Man and Donkey Kong fell away, but they could not beat increasingly impressive home consoles such as Sony\u2019s PlayStation, which came along in the mid-90s, and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox at the turn of the century. Seaside arcades have clung on as \u201cfamily entertainment centres\u201d or \u201cmixed entertainment facilities\u201d, full of games aimed at small children alongside rides and attractions. However, VR Star in Bristol is one of several hundred virtual reality arcades around the UK that are persuading gamers to quit their homes for the high street. They mirror a global trend for dedicated \u201cVRcades\u201d springing up in the US, Japan, South Korea and China. With 380 such dedicated venues now operating around the world, could VR offer the arcade a route back in the shape of so-called \u201cdestination gaming\u201d? While it\u2019s possible to buy budget technology, good quality VR is expensive. HTC\u2019s Vive headset is available for around \u00a3599 in the UK, but to function effectively it requires a computer with serious processing power and a high quality graphics card, raising the bar to thousands of pounds. Even then you\u2019re not tapping the full potential of VR gaming. The driving simulators and shoot-em-ups in VR Star Bristol are further brought to life with motion sensors and high-quality sound, taking the experience to another level. The 360-degree visuals and depth of field take on another dimension when paired with hydraulics and tilting floors. LA-based Dreamscape Immersive\u2019s Alien Zoo experience even uses wind machines to add to the sensation of movement. \u201cTo get the full experience, VR needs what we call SiSoMo: sight, sound and motion,\u201d says Martin Higginson, the executive chairman of British developer Immotion, which owns VR Star. \u201cIf you want a truly immersive experience you need high-end components, and for that reason VR will be an out-of-home experience for some years. I\u2019ve spent most of my life in digital media and it is the most exciting thing yet.\u201d Situated in a modest space in Cabot Circus shopping centre, VR Star was launched to test the waters in mid-December. By the beginning of March, it had admitted 4,000 customers, paying \u00a330 an hour. The enthusiastic response has encouraged the company to open four more venues in Swindon, Cardiff, Manchester and Leeds. A total of 60 VR Stars are planned around the country, along with units in existing arcades and custom-made rides for brands such as Legoland. Just before Christmas, Immotion announced a \u00a31.3m investment to launch its platforms in Europe and the US. The units in VR Star play games from a Chinese developer but Immotion intends to run its own titles following last year\u2019s acquisition of Studio Liddell, a Manchester-based animation producer. \u201cWhat you see and experience currently is like the early days of computer gaming,\u201d says Higginson. \u201cIt\u2019s going to improve rapidly. Those games are 2K [screen resolution] but very soon we will be running 4K with faster processing and better rendering. We will take you on Jurassic rides or helicopter you over the Serengeti and it will blow you away.\u201d Experts say VR has come at the right time for the arcade business. \u201cArcades have always had lifecycles reflecting changing innovation,\u201d says Devi Kolli, the head of VR equipment firm AiSolve. \u201cThey can\u2019t survive the way they are without reinventing themselves with cutting-edge technology, and we are part of that. The response to VR so far suggests the market is hungry for good products.\u201d If they are prepared to invest in the new generation of VR, existing arcades could enjoy a return to prominence as gaming destinations, though they will have to compete with dedicated spaces like VR Star. Jeremy Dalton, a VR consultant at PwC, is more positive. He says the complexity of setting up VR experiences offers an ideal chance for arcades. \u201cThe set-up issues with VR provides a perfect opportunity for third parties ... and that\u2019s gaming arcades. You just hand over your money and enjoy the ride.\u201d",

LA-based Dreamscape Immersive\u2019s Alien Zoo experience even uses wind machines to add to the sensation of movement.</p> <p>\u201cTo get the full experience, VR needs what we call SiSoMo: sight, sound and motion,\u201d says Martin Higginson, the executive chairman of British developer Immotion, which owns VR Star. \u201cIf you want a truly immersive experience you need high-end components, and for that reason VR will be an out-of-home experience for some years. I\u2019ve spent most of my life in digital media and it is the most exciting thing yet.\u201d</p> <p>Situated in a modest space in Cabot Circus shopping centre, VR Star was launched to test the waters in mid-December. By the beginning of March, it had admitted 4,000 customers, paying \u00a330 an hour.</p> <p>The enthusiastic response has encouraged the company to open four more venues in Swindon, Cardiff, Manchester and Leeds. A total of 60 VR Stars are planned around the country, along with units in existing arcades and custom-made rides for brands such as Legoland. Just before Christmas, Immotion announced a \u00a31.3m investment to launch its platforms in Europe and the US.</p> <p>The units in VR Star play games from a Chinese developer but Immotion intends to run its own titles following last year\u2019s acquisition of Studio Liddell, a Manchester-based animation producer.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you see and experience currently is like the early days of computer gaming,\u201d says Higginson. \u201cIt\u2019s going to improve rapidly. Those games are 2K [screen resolution] but very soon we will be running 4K with faster processing and better rendering. We will take you on Jurassic rides or helicopter you over the Serengeti and it will blow you away.\u201d</p> <p>Experts say VR has come at the right time for the arcade business. \u201cArcades have always had lifecycles reflecting changing innovation,\u201d says Devi Kolli, the head of VR equipment firm AiSolve. \u201cThey can\u2019t survive the way they are without reinventing themselves with cutting-edge technology, and we are part of that. The response to VR so far suggests the market is hungry for good products.\u201d</p> <p>If they are prepared to invest in the new generation of VR, existing arcades could enjoy a return to prominence as gaming destinations, though they will have to compete with dedicated spaces like VR Star.</p> <p>Jeremy Dalton, a VR consultant at PwC, is more positive. He says the complexity of setting up VR experiences offers an ideal chance for arcades. \u201cThe set-up issues with VR provides a perfect opportunity for third parties ... and that\u2019s gaming arcades. You just hand over your money and enjoy the ride.\u201d</p>",
