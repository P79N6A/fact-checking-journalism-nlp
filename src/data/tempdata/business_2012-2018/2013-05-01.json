      "bodyText": "The trio of oligarchs behind Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) \u2013 the FTSE 100 miner being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office \u2013 have been hit by a fraud and bribery lawsuit against a separate part of their empire. The Guardian has established that claims lodged in the Dutch courts show that International Mineral Resources (IMR) \u2013 which is wholly owned by the ENRC trio of Alexander Machkevitch, Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov \u2013 is accused of \"blatant fraud, exacerbated by bribery\" by Russian fertiliser group EuroChem. EuroChem had previously said it was claiming damages of $800m (\u00a3500m) from its supplier Shaft Sinkers, which is 48% owned by IMR, following problems with a $2bn Russian potash mining project. In the new case, the fertiliser group alleges that an IMR executive bribed a EuroChem employee with hundreds of thousands of roubles to cover up the alleged ineffectiveness of Shaft Sinkers' work. It also claims IMR facilitated the concealment of a report that questioned whether Shaft Sinkers's sealing technology could be effective on the potash project. EuroChem, which is owned by the Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko, is again seeking $800m in damages \u2013 but this time from IMR \u2013 having made a similar-sized claim in October in separate arbitration proceedings against Shaft Sinkers. IMR says its defence to the Dutch case will state that the EuroChem employee had signed a formal consultancy agreement with Shaft Sinkers to help it promote its business, which he had cleared with his immediate superior. They will also argue the alleged briber was only a consultant to IMR, not an employee. An IMR spokesman added: \"The suggestion that IMR was somehow involved in the legitimate arrangement between Shaft Sinkers and a EuroChem employee is a fabrication.\" IMR says no payments were made by itas part of this process or at all, and also that Shaft Sinkers has at all times been run as a separate entity with separate corporate governance. It says any payments that might have made under any consultancy agreement between Shaft Sinkers and the Russian company would have been entirely legitimate and proper. Shaft Sinkers, which terminated the contract to prevent flooding of a 1,000 metre mining shaft, has filed counterclaims in its separate cases with EuroChem for $15m of fees it says it is still owed. A spokeswoman for Shaft Sinkers added: \"Shaft Sinkers understands that EuroChem has issued proceedings against IMR in the Dutch courts and that IMR has instructed lawyers and intends to vigorously defend such proceedings. \"The three arbitrations [two in Zurich, one in Paris] between EuroChem and Shaft Sinkers and the claims brought by Shaft Sinkers in all three arbitrations are subject to confidentiality and we therefore cannot comment on these cases other than to reiterate that we believe EuroChem's claims are without merit and we are defending these claims and pushing our claims vigorously. \" Likewise we believe the claim brought against IMR is without merit. The original contract was awarded to Shaft Sinkers in 2008 and was terminated by Shaft Sinkers in 2012\" In 2010 Shaft Sinkers floated on the London Stock Exchange but, after initially performing well, the shares have now lost about 70% of their value, and slumped by about a third last October on news of the EuroChem dispute. On Monday, Shaft Sinkers's annual results statement noted that last year's 15% drop in revenues to \u00a3192.5m was partly attributable to the termination of the project with EuroChem. The oligarchs behind IMR also own 44% of ENRC, which faces an SFO inquiry into allegations of \"fraud, bribery and corruption relating to the activities of the company or its subsidiaries in Kazakhstan and Africa\". The move followed an internal ENRC investigation into string of corruption allegations, frequent corporate governance rows and a procession of high profile departures from the mining company.

      "body": "<p>The Federal Reserve has explicitly criticised budget cuts imposed by Congress, blaming fiscal policy for holding back the US's economic recovery.</p> <p>After a two-day meeting, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) said on Wednesday in a statement that despite signs of recovery \"fiscal policy is restraining economic growth\". The statement is the FOMC's boldest assertion to date that Washington policy is hampering the US's fragile economic recovery. It stands in marked contrast to last month's more cautious statement, which said \"fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive\".</p> <p>The FOMC released its statement after two key reports suggested that recovery in the jobs market is slowing, as end of year tax hikes and budget cuts \u2013 known as sequestration \u2013 seem to take their toll.The Fed announced on Wednesday that it would keep <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/20/federal-reserve-stimulus-interest-rates\">pumping $85bn a month into the US economy</a>, citing concerns about the impact Washington's budget cuts are having on the US recovery.</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at the trader BTIG, said: \"They increasingly view fiscal policy as an impediment to what they've been trying to accomplish and today's statement is an outright affirmation of that view. Fiscal policy 'is' restraining growth, from the Fed's point of view. And as long as fiscal policy remains constrictive, then the Fed are likely to do more rather than less.\"<br> The Fed also left interest rates unchanged but said it would \"closely monitor\" economic and financial information in the coming months.</p> <p>The Fed said: \"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown some improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.\"</p> <p>Last September, the Fed announced plans to buy $40bn a month in mortgage-backed securities, in an attempt to bolster the still fragile housing market, and another $45bn in Treasury securities. </p> <p>The bond-buying programme, known as quantitative easing, is open ended and meant to bring down the cost of borrowing, in order to stimulate the economy. Economists had expected the Fed to start cutting back on the programme by the summer, at which point $1tn will have been pumped into the economy.</p> <p>But recent economic news has suggested a slowdown in the US recovery.

      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve has explicitly criticised budget cuts imposed by Congress, blaming fiscal policy for holding back the US's economic recovery. After a two-day meeting, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) said on Wednesday in a statement that despite signs of recovery \"fiscal policy is restraining economic growth\". The statement is the FOMC's boldest assertion to date that Washington policy is hampering the US's fragile economic recovery. It stands in marked contrast to last month's more cautious statement, which said \"fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive\". The FOMC released its statement after two key reports suggested that recovery in the jobs market is slowing, as end of year tax hikes and budget cuts \u2013 known as sequestration \u2013 seem to take their toll.The Fed announced on Wednesday that it would keep pumping $85bn a month into the US economy, citing concerns about the impact Washington's budget cuts are having on the US recovery. Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at the trader BTIG, said: \"They increasingly view fiscal policy as an impediment to what they've been trying to accomplish and today's statement is an outright affirmation of that view. Fiscal policy 'is' restraining growth, from the Fed's point of view. And as long as fiscal policy remains constrictive, then the Fed are likely to do more rather than less.\" The Fed also left interest rates unchanged but said it would \"closely monitor\" economic and financial information in the coming months. The Fed said: \"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown some improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.\" Last September, the Fed announced plans to buy $40bn a month in mortgage-backed securities, in an attempt to bolster the still fragile housing market, and another $45bn in Treasury securities. The bond-buying programme, known as quantitative easing, is open ended and meant to bring down the cost of borrowing, in order to stimulate the economy. Economists had expected the Fed to start cutting back on the programme by the summer, at which point $1tn will have been pumped into the economy. But recent economic news has suggested a slowdown in the US recovery. Last month's nonfarm payroll jobs figures showed the pace of hiring dropping off. The latest jobs figures are released Friday and come after ADP, a leading payroll processor, on Wednesday reported a similar slowdown in hiring in the private sector. \"The committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes,\" the FOMC said in its statement. Recently there have been sign of dissent within the FOMC about the efficacy of the programme. This month's FOMC meeting said committee member Esther George, president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, had voted against further QE as she was \"concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations\".",

      "bodyText": "The Office for National Statistics has paved the way for erasing Britain's double-dip recession from the history books, arguing in an article on Wednesday that the state of the economy since autumn 2010 is better described as \"flat\". The standard definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, and the ONS's current estimates show nine months of consistent decline, starting in the final quarter of 2011. But with revised GDP figures for the last few years due to be published on 27 June, the ONS used its latest Economic Review to point out that two of the relevant quarters saw just a 0.1% fall, and the third \u2013 April to June 2012 \u2013 was distorted by the extra bank holiday for the Queen's diamond jubilee. \"When growth is very weak, the difference between, say, estimated growth of 0.1% and -0.1% in a quarter is actually within the statistical margin of error,\" the ONS said. \"Rather than relying on small changes in quarterly growth rates to justify calling a recession, we should consider the growth rate of the economy over a longer period\". Since the third quarter of 2010, the report added, the trend in economic output was \"best described as one that is flat or at best gently rising\". A spokesman for the ONS insisted that the data was just as likely to be revised down \u2013 making the double dip deeper \u2013 as up. But City analysts said they wouldn't be surprised if the recession eventually disappeared from the official records. Chris Williamson, of data provider Markit, said: \"I think we're in for some fairly significant revisions, and they seem to be pointing to that period where the official figures show a double dip, but the business surveys were strong.\" The ONS report was published as respected thinktank the National Institute for Economic &amp; Social Research revised up its forecast for GDP this year, but cautioned that the latest estimate of 0.9% growth would not have much impact on the jobs market. It said a report by David Bell of the University of Stirling and David Blanchflower, a former Bank of England policymaker, showed that labour market slack was higher than implied by the unemployment statistics. According to an index created by the two economists the number of people under-employed has grown faster than unemployment. They found that a large proportion of full-time staff, part-time workers and the self employed want more hours than their employers are prepared to offer to boost their take-home pay and living standards. They said: \"The conventional measure of the difference between supply and demand in the labour market is the unemployment rate. But it does not capture a phenomenon which has become increasingly important during the current recession - underemployment.\" One implication of the study, they said, was that employers were likely to increase the hours of existing workers before hiring new staff, making the situation for younger job seekers tougher. \"Even if there was an upturn in demand, employers would likely extend the hours of existing workers before taking the risk of hiring new young employees,\" they said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The price of oil plunged through the $100 a barrel level on Wednesday after weak manufacturing data from the United States and China prompted fears of a fresh downturn in the global economy. Amid concerns that the long-awaited recovery from the deep slump of 2008-09 has once again been postponed, Brent crude futures dropped by more than $3 a barrel to just over $99 a barrel. The fall \u2013 which followed a 7% decline in Brent during April \u2013 was triggered by weaker than expected surveys of industrial production in the world's two biggest economies and by a report in the US showing a rise in oil stocks to new record levels. The increase in US stocks of crude was seen by dealers as evidence that flagging global demand is affecting demand for energy. \"Oil is extending the weakness that we saw yesterday. The market sentiment is being weighed down by poor activity indicators in China and the United States,\" said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity market strategy at BNP Paribas. Shares and gold also moved lower after surveys of purchasing managers in China and the United States showed their manufacturing sectors flirting with recession. A separate report found that hiring by US companies dropped to its lowest level in seven months, fuelling speculation of only a modest increase in jobs growth when the official American employment figures are released on Friday. Financial markets have rallied strongly since the middle of 2012 on hopes of a sustained recovery in the US, the resolution of the eurozone crisis and a soft landing for China. All three assumptions are now being questioned after a weak run of data that has included lower than expected growth in China, rising unemployment in Europe, and poor jobs data from the US. China's official manufacturing PMI dipped from 50.9 to 50.6 last month, with the weakness attributed to a fall in export orders. The news raised fresh doubts about the strength of the economy following lower than predicted growth in the first three months of 2013. News of a drop in US construction spending and disappointing results from Merck and Mastercard added to Wall Street's concerns that the economy had again faltered. The S&amp;P 500 posted its sixth consecutive month of gains in April - the longest upward move in share prices since September 2009, and hopes that the world's central banks will continue to underpin activity with cheap borrowing costs and quantitative easing limited losses on Wall Street in early trading yesterday. Markets are braced for the European Central Bank to cut the cost of borrowing to 0.5% on Thursday and, following last night's meeting, see no early prospect of the Federal Reserve withdrawing any of the stimulus it is providing to support demand. Crude stocks in the US rose by 6.7m barrels last week to their highest level on record at 395.3m barrels, data from the Energy Information Administration showed, far exceeding forecasts of a 1m barrel build up. In the copper market, the three-month contract on the London Metal Exchange broke the $7,000 a tonne support level. The spot price of gold fell by $34 an ounce to $1,442. Amna Asa, economist at Capital Economics, said: \"The slowdown in global economic growth appears to have hit American manufacturers in April. The ISM manufacturing index dropped to 50.7 in April, from 51.3 in March, erasing almost all of the gain seen over the first quarter and left the index dangerously close to the expansion-contraction level of 50. This coincides with the latest weakness in international surveys.\"",

      "bodyText": "Argos has underlined the waning importance of the high street to retailers by revealing that more customers buy its products online and through click-and-collect services than by making traditional in-store purchases. Profits at its parent, Home Retail Group, which also owns Homebase and Habitat, have fallen for a fifth consecutive year as the retail industry undergoes a transformation against a backdrop of weak consumer confidence. Home Retail Group reported a 23% fall in profit before tax to \u00a399m in the 12 months to 2 March, with revenues broadly flat at \u00a35.48bn. Despite what he described a \"challenging year\", HRG's chief executive, Terry Duddy, said the transformation of Argos from a catalogue to a digital retail business was progressing, as he said like-for-like sales increased for the first time in five years, delivering a 2% rise in like-for-like revenues with underlying profits up 6% to \u00a3100m. Duddy explained the key factor in growth was click-and-collect sales \u2013 where online purchases are collected in the shop \u2013 which now account for 30% of business. He said: \"If you go back to 2002 when we went from a telephone system for ordering products and went onto the internet for the first time, did I think that would now be 30% of our sales? No.\" However, Homebase profits were washed away by poor weather last summer, with sales down nearly 5% and underlying profits halving to \u00a311m.

    "webTitle": "May Day rallies across Europe as Greek workers strike - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The sun is setting on Europe's May Day, after hundreds of thousands of people across the region took to the streets to celebrate workers' rights. Many, too, protested about the economic policies being implemented across the region. The violent scenes seen in Istanbul were not repeated in the eurozone, but there was tension in Berlin and clear anger in cities across Spain. Associated Press's latest report rounds up the situation in Europe (which we've covered through the day - so just scroll back for more details and photos...) and across the globe. Around the world, angry workers unite on May Day - AP Workers around the world united in anger during May Day rallies Wednesday from fury in Europe over austerity measures that have cut wages, reduced benefits and eliminated many jobs altogether, to rage in Asia over relentlessly low pay, the rising cost of living and hideous working conditions that have left hundreds dead in recent months. In protests, strikes and other demonstrations held in cities across the planet, activists lashed out at political and business leaders they allege have ignored workers' voices or enriched themselves at the expense of laborers. In some places, the demonstrations turned violent, with activists clashing with police. Many nations have been struggling with economic downturns for several years now, and workplace disasters in developing countries are nothing new, but the intensity of some of Wednesday's gatherings suggested workers' frustrations have grown especially acute, with many demanding immediate action to address their concerns. The anger was painfully evident in Bangladesh, where the collapse last week of an illegally built eight-story facility housing multiple garment factories killed more than 400 in a Dhaka suburb. The building collapse followed a garment factory fire in November that killed 112 people in the country, and it has increased the pressure on the global garment industry to improve working conditions. A loud procession of thousands of workers wound through central Dhaka on Wednesday. Many waved the national flag and demanded the death penalty for the now-detained owner of the doomed building. From a loudspeaker on the back of a truck, a participant spoke for the throngs gathered: \"My brother has died. My sister has died. Their blood will not be valueless.\" The Bangladesh tragedy drew a denunciation from Pope Francis during a private Mass at the Vatican. He blasted what he called the \"slave\" wages of those who died, many of whom were being buried Wednesday as other bodies were still being pulled from the rubble. Francis criticized the focus on \"balance books\" and personal profit that he said are tied to the failure to pay workers fair wages. In Greece and Spain, increasing numbers of people are losing their jobs as governments grappling with a debt crisis have been cutting spending, raising taxes and pursuing other stinging austerity measures. Both countries have unemployment rates hovering just above 27 percent. Unions in Greece held a May Day strike that brought ferry and train services to a halt, and organized peaceful protest marches through central Athens. The country, which nearly went bankrupt in 2010, is now in its sixth year of a deep recession and is dependent on international bailout loans. While the austerity drive has succeeded in reducing high budget deficits, it has been at a huge cost: under the terms of its latest loan disbursement, Athens has agreed to sack about 15,000 civil servants through 2014. \"We are here to send a message to ... those in power in Europe, that we will continue our struggle against unfair, open-ended policies that are destroying millions of jobs on a national and European level,\" said Kostas Tsikrikas, leader of Greek public sector labor union ADEDY. More than 100,000 Spaniards infuriated by austerity measures and economic recession took to the streets of some 80 cities in trade union-organized rallies Wednesday, with the largest protests in Madrid, Barcelona and Bilbao. Under banners reading \"Fight for your rights,\" union leaders Ignacio Fernandez Toxo of Workers Commissions and Candido Mendez of the General Workers Union called on the government to reverse its austerity drive and urged politicians to agree an all-party economic plan aimed at creating jobs. Francisco Moreno, an unemployed bookkeeper, scoffed at Spanish leaders' calls on the public to be patient. \"You can only be patient if you have savings, money in the bank,\" the 47-year-old said. \"You can't be patient if you have no income and kids to feed.\" May Day events in Turkey turned violent when some demonstrators, angered at a government ban on a symbolic rally point, hurled stones, gasoline bombs and fireworks at riot police. Security forces used water cannon and tear gas to prevent crowds from accessing Taksim Square, and Istanbul Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu said 22 police officers and at least three passersby were injured. More than 72 demonstrators were arrested. The square is the city's main hub and is undergoing a major facelift. Authorities banned celebrations at Taksim this year, citing construction safety risks, and partially suspended public transport services to prevent large gatherings there. But trade unions had vowed to mark MayDay in Taksim, which has symbolic importance because dozens of protesters were killed there in 1977 when unidentified gunmen opened fire on May Day celebrators. \"Taksim is our sacred venue. Open it up to the workers!\" demanded Kani Beko, leader of a major labor union confederation. Boos and whistles from protesters forced Danish Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt to halt her May Day speech to thousands at the gathering in Aarhus, some 200 kilometers (125 miles) northwest of Copenhagen. Some believe that she has been leaning too far to the right to uphold the goals of her leftist Social Democratic Party. As she was walking to her car, a man squirted her with a water pistol. Police spokesman Carsten Dahl said police had detained the 23-year-old man, but the premier was not injured. Swedish police said seven people were arrested and five were injured as counter-demonstrators tried to interrupt a MayDay parade by right-wing extremists in the southern city of Jonkoping. Police spokesman Goran Gunnarsson said 60 others were briefly detained as officers tried to keep the two sides apart. In Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous country, tens of thousands of workers rallied for higher pay and other demands. Some also carried banners reading: \"Sentence corruptors to death and seize their properties\" to protest a proposal for the government to slash fuel subsidies that have kept the country's pump prices among the cheapest in the region. In the Philippines, an estimated 8,000 workers marched in Manila to also demand better pay and regular jobs instead of contractual work. Some rallied outside the U.S. Embassy, torching a wooden painting stamped with the words \"low wages\" and \"union busting\" that depicted Philippine President Benigno Aquino III as a lackey of President Barack Obama. More than 10,000 Taiwanese protested a government plan to cut pension payouts to solve worsening fiscal problems, saying it reflects a government policy to bolster economic growth at the expense of workers' benefits. Analysts say poor income levels have forced many young Taiwanese to share housing with their parents and delay marriages. And in Cambodia, more than 5,000 garment workers marched in Phnom Penh, demanding better working conditions and a salary increase from $80 to $150 a month. About a half million people work in the country's $4.6 billion garment industry, which makes brand name clothes for many U.S. and European retailers. In Mexico, public school teachers who have blocked highways and battled police in recent months marched peacefully Wednesday in Mexico City and the southern city of Chilpancingo, hoping to block an education reform law that introduces teacher evaluations and diminishes the power of unions in hiring decisions. \"Not here, not there, the reform shall not pass anywhere!\" the marchers chanted. In his May 1 speech, President Enrique Pena Nieto promised new effort to produce more salaried jobs, noting that two-thirds of Mexicans have no benefits and low wages. In Havana, tens of thousands of Cubans joined the communist nation's traditional MayDay march in the Plaza of the Revolution. This year's edition was dedicated to Cuba's ally, the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Cuban President Raul Castro attended the event, but did not speak. I'll be back tomorrow. Goodnight, and thanks. Heads- up, debt crisis team. Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart have published an opinion piece in tomorrow's Financial Times on how we escape the debt crisis. The Harvard pair don't directly refer to the spat that broke out last month over their work on debt/GDP levels (the infamous Excel spreadsheet gaffe incident), beyond expressing disappointment that \"The recent debate about the global economy has taken a distressingly simplistic turn.\" The main thrust of the piece is that austerity isn't the only answer to a debt crisis -- debt defaults are another key part: Here's a flavour: First and foremost, governments must be prepared to write down debts rather than continuing to absorb them. This principle applies to the senior debt of insolvent financial institutions, to peripheral eurozone debt and to mortgage debt in the US. For Europe, in particular, any reasonable endgame will require a large transfer from Germany to the periphery. The sooner this implicit transfer becomes explicit, the sooner Europe will be able to find its way towards a stable growth path. They also dismiss those who suggest that the current record-low interest rates mean countries could safely stimulate growth by raising their borrowing levels higher: Economists simply have little idea how long it will be until rates begin to rise. If one accepts that maybe, just maybe, a significant rise in interest rates in the next decade might be a possibility, then plans for an unlimited open-ended surge in debt should give one pause. Here's the full piece: Austerity is not the only answer to a debt problem Oh, and speaking of interest rates... the US Federal Reserve has voted to leave America's borrowing costs unchanged. One last photo from Berlin, of left-wing protesters carrying a giant puppet during the annual May Day march. Italy's new prime minister, Enrico Letta, appeared to enjoy a cordial visit to Paris today to meet Francois Hollande. Letta's mesage that Europe needs a new growth strategy clearly chimed with the French president's own views. Letta said he was \"100 percent satisfied\" with his meeting with Hollande, and told reporters he hopes to stimulate Italian economic growth and cut taxes. Our government's choice is to maintain the commitments we have made towards the European Union and, within those commitments, to make the choices which we think are needed for our country to have more room for growth and lower taxes. Hollande also offered support, stating that: Europe has to do the maximum it can for growth. No new policies, though, and Letta didn't bow to pressure from members of his new coalition to tear up Italy's deficit targets. There were hundreds of events in Germany today to mark May Day -- unions say that over 400,000 people took part. Europe's economic plight was on the mind of Michael Sommer, head of the DGB federation of German labour unions, who argued that the region's largest economy should do more to help the rest. We cannot allow this continent to be 'kaputtgespart' - forced to save so much that it breaks apart. There was also tension between union marchers, and seperate rallies organised by far-right groups. And in Berlin, approximately 500 supporters of the far-right extremist NPD party took part in the demonstration, while several thousand counter-protesters heckled them and tried to block their route: More details of the protests against Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt today (see 5.01pm onwards), from AP: Thorning-Schmidt became a target of both booing and a water pistol during a May Day parade in her country, where some believe that she has been leaning too far to the right to uphold the goals of her leftist Social Democratic Party. Boos and whistles from protesters forced Thorning-Schmidt to abort her speech to thousands at the gathering in Aarhus, some 200 kilometers (125 miles) northwest of Copenhagen. Then, as she was walking to her car, a man squirted water on her with a water pistol. Police spokesman Carsten Dahl said police had detained the 23-year-old man, but the premier was not injured. Associated Press reports that more than 100,000 Spaniards took part in today's protests, across 80 different cities in the recession-hit country. We've already covered the protests in Madrid (2.56pm) and Barcelona (3.31pm). And here's a video clip of the protests against Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt today. In Denmark a demonstrator firing a waterpistol at the country's prime minister as she gave a speech in the city of Aarhus. Protesters waved pictures of unhappy faces at Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who is facing opposition from public sector unions over planned spending cuts, during her speech: The unidentified man who shot a water gun towards Thorning-Schmidt was detained by police officers: A splurge of weak economic data from the US has added to concerns over the strength of the American economy, and its labour market. \u2022 US firms are hiring new employees at their lowest rate in seven months. The monthly ADP national employment report missed forecasts, coming in at 119,000 new employees (not the 150,000 expected by economists). \u2022 Construction spending in the US fell by 1.7% in March. \u2022 The monthly manufacturing survey, or PMI, fell to 50.7 in April, down from 51.3 in March. \u2022 The oil price has tumbled by $3 per barrel after new data showed a sharp jump in oil inventories in the last week. That rise in oil prices could signal a drop in demand as economic activity stalls, although there are other reasons... One more picture from Istanbul - taken just before clashes broke out: Anger over Spain's austerity programme was also visible in Barcelona, where May Day marchers paraded through the city. This 'Wanted' placard labelled Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy as a \"serial swindler\". Developments in the eurozone... Slovenia is still planning to hold a bond sale which was yanked from the market after it was downgraded to junk status by Moody's last night. In a statement, the Slovenian government explained: After Moody's downgrade of Slovenia the issue of the US dollar bond is not dropped and will continue. Due to the U.S. regulations related to the bond issues we cannot provide further details. Slovenia is struggling to restructure its banking sector, which is mainly state-owned. Some analysts believe will need bailing out this year. CNBC has a good write-up of the situation in Slovenia: New Problem for Europe: Slovenia Downgrade a Bad Omen? Spain's May Day protests were well-attended, with thoudsands of people taking part in a Labour Day match in Madrid. Some carried flags and placards and slogans such as \"austerity ruins and kills\" and \"reforms are robbery\". Spain's unemployment level has now hit a record-breaking 27%, and it's economy has now been shrinking for the last seven quarters. Candido Mendez, head of the UGT union, declared: [there has never been a May 1 with more reason to take to the streets Former civil servant Alicia Candelas, 54, who has been without a job for two years, told Reuters that: The future of Spain looks terrible, we're going backwards with this government Via GuardianWitness, here's a photo of water cannon being used in Istanbul today (see 12.02pm for details of the clashes) There were protests against Francois Hollande and his government's fiscal plans during today's May Day marches. It's nearly a year since Hollande ousted Nicolas Sarkozy to claim the French presidency.Back in May 2012, the Soclalist party's success looked, to some, like a decisive moment in Europe's debt crisis that would change the whole political landscape. Not any more. As Agn\u00e8s Poirier wrote yesterday: Fran\u00e7ois Hollande had planned it all and it sure looked good on paper. In just over a year, the balance of power in Europe would shift and the French president would manage to impose his anti-austerity views on the rest of the continent. He would only be a lone voice in Europe for a matter of months. He would soon find strong allies in Pier Luigi Bersani, leader of the Italian left, who would sweep Italy off her feet, and in the German Social Democrats who would finally oust Angela Merkel from power. He would then triumphantly introduce his pro-growth agenda, adjusting monetary policy with a mix of quantitative easing and a dash of inflation. All the things Germany had always vehemently said no to. Except that now, Hollande's plan can go straight in the bin. More here May Day is also being marked in the UK, including a march taking place in London to protect the local hospital. And, via GuardianWitness, here are some photos: You can send in your own photos from May Day events - just click here. Two more photos from Athens -- showing a burned Flag of Europe and a man setting fire to a poster of German chancellor Angela Merkel dressed as a Nazi. The May Day rallies in Athens passed off peacefully, with no indications of any clashes between marchers and the police. Metro stations in the centre of the city have now reopened. There were also demonstrations in Thessaloniki, Greece's second-largest city: The Pope has challenged European leaders to do more to combat the unemployment crisis that is gripping the region. As workers marched in several European capitals, Pope Francis told a gathering in St Peter's Square that unemployment was the product of a focus on profits over social justice. The Pope said: I call on politicians to make every effort to relaunch the labour market...Work is fundamental for dignity I think of labour market difficulties in various countries. I think of people, not just young people, who are unemployed often because of an economic conception of society based on selfish profit outside the bounds of social justice. Yesterday, the eurozone jobless rate his 12.1% - or 24% for young people. And this morning, the Irish unemployment rate was unchanged at 14%. These photos from Istanbul show the clashes between protesters and police (see also 12.02pm) And here's AFP's latest report: Several people were injured on Wednesday as Turkish riot police used water canon and tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters who defied a May Day ban on demonstrations in a central part of Istanbul. About a dozen people were hospitalized after exposure to tear gas which clogged the air around the symbolic Taksim square, according to AFP journalists. Two policemen were among those injured as well as an AFP photographer who was assaulted by protesters wearing balaclavas who broke one of his cameras. The Istanbul governor\u2019s office said 20 protesters had been arrested. The Turkish government decided to ban May Day gatherings on Taksim Square \u2014 a traditional rallying point \u2014 saying that because of renovations begun in November, security could not be assured for the tens of thousands of demonstrators expected. But the leftist Disk union vowed to ignore the ban. Turkey has mobilised 22,000 police to provide security throughout the day. Protesters threw stones at the police who tried to prevent the protest in the Besiktas neighborhood of Istanbul, which is about two kilometers (a mile) from Taksim square. \u201cDeath to fascism. Long live May 1,\u201d shouted the protesters who were rallying to calls from leftist parties and unions. The Guardian has launched a new digital platform allowing readers to contribute to live news, GuardianWitness. (Click here for full details.) Send us your photos and videos, if you happen to be on a May Day march today by clicking the \u201ccontribute to this article\u201d link above or clicking here, and we\u2019ll post the most interesting pictures and footage on the blog. Thanks! Outside the eurozone, there have been violent clashes in Istanbul today between May Day marchers and police. Officers fired water cannon and tear gas at crowds in the Turkish capital, after authorities blocked off access to parts of the capital including Taksim square. Several people have been injured. Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, is there and reports that tear gas was fired \"indiscriminately\". She's deeply concerned that workers were attacked while trying to attend a rally to celebrate their rights: Sharan also encountered plain-clothed police officers.. Another snap from Syntaga Square in Athens: It looks to be a smaller turnout than in previous marches in Greece -- one reason may be that people have left the city for Orthodox Easter. Another factor could be protest fatigue. The head of Greece's main public sector union has explained that today's march is another attempt to make the Greek government change course: Ilias Iliopoulos, general secretary of public sector union ADEDY, told Reuters that: Our message today is very clear: Enough with these policies which hurt people and make the poor poorer The government must take back the austerity measures, people can't take it anymore. On Sunday the Greek parliament agreed another raft of cost-cutting measures and economic reforms, which will includes 15,000 civil service jobs being cut by the end of 2014. In return, it will continue to receive loand from its troika of international lenders. You can watch the May Day demonstrations in Athens live, on Zougla's website. There's little action in the financial markets this morning, as most of Europe's stock exchanges are shut for May Day. We're still toiling away in London, though, where the FTSE 100 is up 31 points at 6461. The news of China's manufacturing slowdown, and yesterday's record unemployment figures, continue to be shrugged off. Alexis Tsipras, the head of the Syriza opposition party, has joined the workers marching through Athens: Protesters in Athens have reached Syntagma Square: And here's another photo of a small group carrying a banner: There's a powerful piece in the Financial Times this morning about today's May Day rallies, and the political implications of the ongoing struggle with growth and austerity: Here's a flavour: A collective howl of protest and despair will resound through Europe\u2019s streets and squares on Wednesday at the annual May 1 rallies, which, in happier times, celebrate the dignity of human labour. It is difficult to be festive when 26m Europeans are jobless and economic recession blights the continent. For the first time in generations, numerous parents fear that the future living standards of their children will be lower than their own. Their sense of powerlessness is all the greater because, in or out of government, Europe\u2019s centre-left parties \u2013 once the formidable political voice of the organised working classes \u2013 no longer appear capable of fulfilling their historical mission as protectors of jobs, welfare and social cohesion. Tony Barber goes on to argue that the left is struggling to present a clear alternative in these straitened times (in the UK, Labour's Ed Miliband came unstuck on BBC radio this week when quizzed over his proposal for a tax cut to stimulate spending). But the wheel of politics keeps moving, Barber argues: The shortcomings of centre-right governments doubtless guarantee that the centre-left will one day return to power in economically struggling European countries, just as the Socialists did one year ago in France thanks to depleted public confidence in Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president. Unless, of course, voters turn to the new wave of parties offering a change to the status quo -- such as Italy's Five Star Movement, Germany's Alternative For Deutschland, and UKIP in Britain. More here: Global insight: Mayday distress of Europe\u2019s anti-austerity left Back to Greece -- and university lecturer Spyros Gkelis flags up a banner calling for solidarity with migrant workers: The issue of Greece's foreign workers hit the headlines last month after a group at a strawberry picking site were shot after seeking their unpaid wages. Better news for Britain's industrial workers - the slowdown in UK manufacturing output was almost halted last month. The monthly manufacturing PMI rose to 49.8 from 48.6 (where anything above 50 would equal growth). There are worrying signs for workers in this morning's economic data. China's manufacturing sector suffered an unexpected slowdown last month, showing that its economic growth is fragile (details here). In Ireland this morning...manufacturing output has fallen for the first time in a year. The communist PAME union's rally in Athens is underway, and appears to be peaceful and well-attended. Here's the best early photos, via Twitter: Marches are already getting underway in Athens this morning. The communist affiliated PAME union's rally started at 10.30am local time (8.30am BST) in Syntagma Square, in the centre of the Greek capital. Other ralles are also taking The private sector union GSEE union and the public sector union ADEDY will begin their rally at 11am (Living in Greece has more details) at Kafthmonos Square in central Athens. Transport links are affected by the strike -- with ferry services suspended today and some train services starting late. Schools and hospitals are also likely to be affected by the walkout. Greece's Kathimerini explains: Buses and trolley buses are expected to run between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., while the metro and the Piraeus-Kifissia electric railway (ISAP) will operate after 9 a.m. There will be no metro to Athens International Airport], whil tram services will commence at 8 a.m. TrainOse, operating inter-city trains and the Attica suburban railway, known as proastiakos, is also taking part in the strike. Ferries will remain docked across the country, while public hospitals will be operating with skeleton staff throughout the day. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events in the eurozone crisis, and across the world economy. It's May Day. Traditionally a time when European workers would pause to celebrate labour rights and the reforms which were won from employers and governments in earlier days, But with more people out of work across Europe than ever before, today will see an outpouring of anger over the region's financial plight. Strikes are taking place in Greece, where the main unions will hold marches to Syntagma Square to demonstrate outside the parliament building. And there will be rallies in major cities across Europe -- including in Spain, where the record unemployment and ongoing recession is likely to drive many people onto the streets. It comes as Italy's new prime minister, Enrico Letta, visits Brussels and Paris to discuss the financial crisis. Letta has made economic growth the cornerstone of his new government's programme, criticising Europe's focus on austerity and deficit reduction. Letta met with Angela Merkel in Berlin last night, where he told reporters that: We want to see Europe show the same determination to pursue growth as it does to maintain sound public finances. Many of those on the streets of Athens and Madrid today might agree.... Elsewhere today, some disappointing manufacturing data from China hasadded to fears that the world economy is slowing down... and concern is growing that Slovenia may need international help after it was downgraded to Junk status by Moody's last night. I'll be tracking events through the day.....",

Photograph: Jodi Hilton/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The sun is setting on Europe's May Day, after hundreds of thousands of people across the region took to the streets to celebrate workers' rights</strong>.</p> <p>Many, too, protested about the economic policies being implemented across the region. The violent scenes seen in Istanbul were not repeated in the eurozone, but there was tension in Berlin and clear anger in cities across Spain.</p> <p>Associated Press's latest report rounds up the situation in Europe (<em>which we've covered through the day - so just scroll back for more details and photos...</em>) and across the globe.</p> <h2><strong>Around the world, angry workers unite on May Day - AP</strong></h2> <p>Workers around the world united in anger during May Day rallies Wednesday from fury in Europe over austerity measures that have cut wages, reduced benefits and eliminated many jobs altogether, to rage in Asia over relentlessly low pay, the rising cost of living and hideous working conditions that have left hundreds dead in recent months.</p> <p>In protests, strikes and other demonstrations held in cities across the planet, activists lashed out at political and business leaders they allege have ignored workers' voices or enriched themselves at the expense of laborers. In some places, the demonstrations turned violent, with activists clashing with police.</p> <p>Many nations have been struggling with economic downturns for several years now, and workplace disasters in developing countries are nothing new, but the intensity of some of Wednesday's gatherings suggested workers' frustrations have grown especially acute, with many demanding immediate action to address their concerns.</p> <p>The anger was painfully evident in Bangladesh, where the collapse last week of an illegally built eight-story facility housing multiple garment factories killed more than 400 in a Dhaka suburb. The building collapse followed a garment factory fire in November that killed 112 people in the country, and it has increased the pressure on the global garment industry to improve working conditions.</p> <p>A loud procession of thousands of workers wound through central Dhaka on Wednesday. Many waved the national flag and demanded the death penalty for the now-detained owner of the doomed building. From a loudspeaker on the back of a truck, a participant spoke for the throngs gathered: \"My brother has died. My sister has died. Their blood will not be valueless.\"</p> <p>The Bangladesh tragedy drew a denunciation from Pope Francis during a private Mass at the Vatican. He blasted what he called the \"slave\" wages of those who died, many of whom were being buried Wednesday as other bodies were still being pulled from the rubble. Francis criticized the focus on \"balance books\" and personal profit that he said are tied to the failure to pay workers fair wages.</p> <p>In Greece and Spain, increasing numbers of people are losing their jobs as governments grappling with a debt crisis have been cutting spending, raising taxes and pursuing other stinging austerity measures. Both countries have unemployment rates hovering just above 27 percent.<br> Unions in Greece held a May Day strike that brought ferry and train services to a halt, and organized peaceful protest marches through central Athens. The country, which nearly went bankrupt in 2010, is now in its sixth year of a deep recession and is dependent on international bailout loans.</p> <p>While the austerity drive has succeeded in reducing high budget deficits, it has been at a huge cost: under the terms of its latest loan disbursement, Athens has agreed to sack about 15,000 civil servants through 2014.</p> <p>\"We are here to send a message to ... those in power in Europe, that we will continue our struggle against unfair, open-ended policies that are destroying millions of jobs on a national and European level,\" said Kostas Tsikrikas, leader of Greek public sector labor union ADEDY.</p> <p>More than 100,000 Spaniards infuriated by austerity measures and economic recession took to the streets of some 80 cities in trade union-organized rallies Wednesday, with the largest protests in Madrid, Barcelona and Bilbao.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f16a0f9c-809b-4029-8b0e-cec50bf83995\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/1/1367434034830/0042e1f0-97d7-45df-ae3e-2b29c761a088-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Thousands gather in the center of Barcelona for the unions rally celebrating May Day.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thousands gather in the center of Barcelona for the unions rally celebrating May Day. Photograph: Esteban Mora/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under banners reading \"Fight for your rights,\" union leaders Ignacio Fernandez Toxo of Workers Commissions and Candido Mendez of the General Workers Union called on the government to reverse its austerity drive and urged politicians to agree an all-party economic plan aimed at creating jobs.</p> <p>Francisco Moreno, an unemployed bookkeeper, scoffed at Spanish leaders' calls on the public to be patient. \"You can only be patient if you have savings, money in the bank,\" the 47-year-old said. \"You can't be patient if you have no income and kids to feed.\"</p> <p>May Day events in Turkey turned violent when some demonstrators, angered at a government ban on a symbolic rally point, hurled stones, gasoline bombs and fireworks at riot police. Security forces used water cannon and tear gas to prevent crowds from accessing Taksim Square, and Istanbul Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu said 22 police officers and at least three passersby were injured. More than 72 demonstrators were arrested.</p> <p>The square is the city's main hub and is undergoing a major facelift. Authorities banned celebrations at Taksim this year, citing construction safety risks, and partially suspended public transport services to prevent large gatherings there. But trade unions had vowed to mark MayDay in Taksim, which has symbolic importance because dozens of protesters were killed there in 1977 when unidentified gunmen opened fire on May Day celebrators.</p> <p>\"Taksim is our sacred venue. Open it up to the workers!\" demanded Kani Beko, leader of a major labor union confederation.</p> <p>Boos and whistles from protesters forced Danish Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt to halt her May Day speech to thousands at the gathering in Aarhus, some 200 kilometers (125 miles) northwest of Copenhagen. Some believe that she has been leaning too far to the right to uphold the goals of her leftist Social Democratic Party. As she was walking to her car, a man squirted her with a water pistol. Police spokesman Carsten Dahl said police had detained the 23-year-old man, but the premier was not injured.<br> Swedish police said seven people were arrested and five were injured as counter-demonstrators tried to interrupt a MayDay parade by right-wing extremists in the southern city of Jonkoping. Police spokesman Goran Gunnarsson said 60 others were briefly detained as officers tried to keep the two sides apart.</p> <p>In Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous country, tens of thousands of workers rallied for higher pay and other demands. Some also carried banners reading: \"Sentence corruptors to death and seize their properties\" to protest a proposal for the government to slash fuel subsidies that have kept the country's pump prices among the cheapest in the region.</p> <p>In the Philippines, an estimated 8,000 workers marched in Manila to also demand better pay and regular jobs instead of contractual work. Some rallied outside the U.S. Embassy, torching a wooden painting stamped with the words \"low wages\" and \"union busting\" that depicted Philippine President Benigno Aquino III as a lackey of President Barack Obama.<br> More than 10,000 Taiwanese protested a government plan to cut pension payouts to solve worsening fiscal problems, saying it reflects a government policy to bolster economic growth at the expense of workers' benefits. Analysts say poor income levels have forced many young Taiwanese to share housing with their parents and delay marriages.</p> <p>And in Cambodia, more than 5,000 garment workers marched in Phnom Penh, demanding better working conditions and a salary increase from $80 to $150 a month. About a half million people work in the country's $4.6 billion garment industry, which makes brand name clothes for many U.S. and European retailers.</p> <p>In Mexico, public school teachers who have blocked highways and battled police in recent months marched peacefully Wednesday in Mexico City and the southern city of Chilpancingo, hoping to block an education reform law that introduces teacher evaluations and diminishes the power of unions in hiring decisions.</p> <p>\"Not here, not there, the reform shall not pass anywhere!\" the marchers chanted.</p> <p>In his May 1 speech, President Enrique Pena Nieto promised new effort to produce more salaried jobs, noting that two-thirds of Mexicans have no benefits and low wages.</p> <p>In Havana, tens of thousands of Cubans joined the communist nation's traditional MayDay march in the Plaza of the Revolution. This year's edition was dedicated to Cuba's ally, the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Cuban President Raul Castro attended the event, but did not speak.</p> <p><strong>I'll be back tomorrow. Goodnight, and thanks.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-175e3bdc-70e4-4120-9e4f-24815ef78ebc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/1/1367434114566/5f250d35-0041-41c0-869c-7af37afef2b2-460x303.jpeg\" alt=\"Protesters shout slogans and hold banners in front of the House of Parliament in Athens.\" width=\"460\" height=\"303\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters shouting slogans and hold banners in front of the House of Parliament in Athens.

For Europe, in particular, any reasonable endgame will require a large transfer from Germany to the periphery. The sooner this implicit transfer becomes explicit, the sooner Europe will be able to find its way towards a stable growth path.</p> </blockquote> <p>They also dismiss those who suggest that the current record-low interest rates mean countries could safely stimulate growth by raising their borrowing levels higher:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Economists simply have little idea how long it will be until rates begin to rise.

In just over a year, the balance of power in Europe would shift and the French president would manage to impose his anti-austerity views on the rest of the continent. He would only be a lone voice in Europe for a matter of months.

      "bodyText": "When is a recession not a recession? According to the Office for National Statistics, when the economy is \"broadly flat\". Fresh from announcing that Britain has escaped a triple dip, the nit-picking number-crunchers are now arguing that the three quarters of declining GDP in late 2011 and early 2012 we've all come affectionately to know as the \"double dip\", should perhaps not qualify as a recession at all. In a new Economic Review, the ONS points out that there's no universally accepted definition of recession \u2013 in the US, for example, a panel of top academics, the National Bureau for Economic Research's business-cycle dating committee makes a judgment about when a recession has taken place, taking into account other factors such as unemployment, as well as output. In Britain, two consecutive quarters of declining output is the usual definition of recession. But the ONS points out that the last quarter of 2011 and the first three months of last year saw marginal declines in GDP of just 0.1%; and the subsequent 0.4% decline from April to June was exaggerated by the extra bank holiday for the Queen's jubilee. \"Rather than relying on small changes in quarterly growth rates to justify calling a recession, we should consider the growth rate of the economy over a longer period\", the ONS argues. This looks suspiciously like a pre-emptive attempt to fend off a wave of statto-bashing \u2013 a favourite sport in the City \u2013 if, as many analysts expect, the double dip is eventually revised away in a later set of statistical estimates. But before George Osborne starts re-writing his legacy \u2013 scratching out the bit where he drove Britain back into recession \u2013 he should read the rest of the ONS's musings. Recession or no recession, they conclude, the economy is flat on its back, or as they prefer it, \"broadly flat\". Worse, in electioneering terms, as the Tories start to look towards 2015, even if the headline-grabbing double dip is wiped away, the ONS says the underlying figures show the economy moving through \"three distinct phases\" since 2008. There was a deep recession, lasting until mid-2009, followed by five quarters of \"steady recovery\"; but from the third quarter of 2010, shortly after the coalition took power, output has been \"flat or at best gently rising\". With a plethora of charts, the report hammers home the point that this has been a weaker recovery than any seen in the 20th century. Worse still, for politicians hoping for a return of the feelgood factor, the 3.8% rise in the population since 2010 has meant that in GDP-per-capita terms, the non-recovery looks even more non-existent. Output-per-head is 12% lower than at this stage after the onset of the painful 1970s recession. It may be fanciful for the ONS to hope that economists \u2013 let alone journalists \u2013 will moderate their language, and soften the long-held, hard and fast definition of \"recession\"; but this new analysis does suggest there's nothing standard about the trauma the British economy has experienced in the past five years \u2013 and as yet, no end in sight.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A rebound in manufacturing appears to be under way after a disastrous start to the year, according to a survey of the sector in April. Strong sales of consumer goods to North America, the Middle East, Latin America and Australia helped the sector stabilise after a slump in January and February. Ministers will cheer a recovery in the sector, especially after the 0.3% rise in GDP in the first three months of the year, which was largely attributed to the strength of the services industry. An improved outlook for manufacturing, which was a drag on output in the first quarter, could allow GDP to maintain a more consistent and positive path over the coming months. The consumer goods industry led the way, with companies producing machine tools not far behind, as the sector showed a modest rise in production amid a widespread clearance of stock left over from the slump earlier in the year. Much of the slump is attributed to bad weather at the beginning of the year, though renewed uncertainty in the eurozone and a persistent lack of bank lending for investment also played a part. Althouth eurozone fears have eased, the situation remains febrile and persistenly tight bank lendingis making some analysts cautious about a possible upturn. The Cips/Markit survey showed the sector continued to shrink last month but by only a small margin. At 49.8, the manufacturing purchasing manager's index (PMI) continued to be below the 50 figure that divides growth from contraction, though it fed expectations of a return to growth in May. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' trade body, said the survey was a mildly encouraging start to the second quarter. \"While still not in positive territory overall, the data indicates a vital revival in export orders with demand from markets in the Americas and Middle East compensating for the continued weakness in Europe. This is a especially positive as the UK sorely needs an improvement in trade if we are to make faster progress on rebalancing growth.\" Markit said the eurozone continued to drag on export sales, but a shift to markets further afield was making up some of the difference. In contrast to the improving output figures, the sector shed jobs for the third straight month and most firms said they remained cautious about a possible sustained recovery. Rob Dobson, an economist at Markit, said: \"Following the poor start to the year, when manufacturing acted as a drag on the economy in the opening quarter, it is welcome to see the sector showing signs of stabilising in April. With forward-looking indicators such as new orders and the demand-to-inventory ratio also ticking higher, the sector should at least be less of a drag on broader GDP growth in the second quarter. \"Manufacturers report that the domestic market is just about holding its head above water, but was still a key cause of disappointingly weak demand, while a solid improvement in new export orders was the real surprise.\" The figures followed a disappointing survey of Chinese manufacturing that showed a dip earlier this year turning into a more prolonged slowdown. The official manufacturing PMI, composed for the statistics bureau by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, fell from 50.9 in March to 50.6 last month. A Capital Economics analyst, Mark Williams, said: \"At face value that is not too big a drop. But April is normally one of the strongest months of the year, particularly for output. The fact that the output component fell at all \u2013 from March's 52.7 to 52.6 \u2013 is therefore a concern,\" he said. \"If the usual pattern holds, output will weaken in coming months.\"",

It expects to receive between \u00a32.5m and \u00a34m from Novartis over the next 12 months. The company's shares have climbed more than 15% to 1.9p on the news. Peel Hunt analyst Dr Stefan Hamill said the deal provided further validation of Oxford Biomedica's technology and also utilised capacity in its manufacturing plant:</p> <blockquote> If the treatment remains successful in further trials, we imagine further revenues are likely downstream. We've upgraded our forecasts, factoring in additional revenues in the second half of 2013 and the first half of 2014, which sees Oxford's cash runway extended by a further three months towards mid 2014. The Lentivector component of our sum of the parts valuation moves up to 0.7p a share (from 0.6p) driving our target price to 1.6p (from 1.5p) on the additional cash flows.

This is an experimentat immunotherapy program Novartis recently licensed from the University of Pennsylvania. It is currently in Phase 1/2 trials to treat various B cell cancers (eg relapsed leukemia in children) and the approach uses patients' own T cells, which are removed and engineered using the Lentivector approach to recognise cancerous B cells more effectively. The cells are then re-infused into patients, where they now attack the cancer (an autologous treatment approach). <br> It appears to us that the University of Pennsylvania likely used Oxford's intellectual property in its early stage trials and that now it is progressing as a commercial program with Novartis, Oxford's intellectual property is locked in. Oxford will manufacture the engineered viruses for next Phase 2 trials of the program. Novartis purchased one of Dendreon's Provenge facilities in late 2012, which we assume is handling the next step, to treat patients autologous T calls with the engineered virus and grow them up.

If both the Retinostat option (estimated to be $20m) is exercised and a ProSavin partnership established this year (as we have forecast), 2013 could prove to be a very successful year for the group.

      "bodyText": "Oxford BioMedica is one of the day's best performers so far after the group unveiled a collaboration with Swiss pharmaceutical group Novartis to work on a key immunotherapy programme to treat cancer cells. Under the deal, the UK business will manufacture clinical grade material using its Lentivector gene delivery technology. It expects to receive between \u00a32.5m and \u00a34m from Novartis over the next 12 months. The company's shares have climbed more than 15% to 1.9p on the news. Peel Hunt analyst Dr Stefan Hamill said the deal provided further validation of Oxford Biomedica's technology and also utilised capacity in its manufacturing plant: If the treatment remains successful in further trials, we imagine further revenues are likely downstream.
