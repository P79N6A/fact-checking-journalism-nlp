      "bodyText": "Renault and Nissan have agreed a truce with the French government over a growing political row that threatened jobs in the UK. The French government has agreed to limit its interference in the operations of the carmakers in return for Nissan not increasing its influence on Renault. The partnership between Renault and Nissan was thrown into crisis after the French government, led by the economy minister and former Rothschild banker Emmanuel Macron, increased its stake in Renault to 19.7% and introduced laws that double the power of long-term investors in the company. Critics feared that Macron was attempting a backdoor nationalisation of Renault and would use his powers to protect and generate jobs in France, such as moving production from Nissan\u2019s factory in Sunderland, the biggest in the UK, across the Channel. Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan, meaning the French government would have had significant power over the Japanese company. Paris would have controlled more than 30% of the voting rights in Renault from April, making it the biggest shareholder and allowing it to dictate its strategy and operations. However, the government has now agreed to limit its voting rights in Renault to 17.9%, except in exceptional circumstances such as a takeover or decisions directly linked to Renault\u2019s operations in France. Renault and Nissan have also agreed that the French company will not interfere in Nissan\u2019s governance. In return, Nissan will not increase its 15% shareholding in Renault, or convert it into voting rights. The two companies formed the Renault-Nissan Alliance in 1999, which led to Renault taking a 43.4% stake in Nissan, and Nissan taking 15% in Renault. Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Renault and Nissan, welcomed the deal with the French government, which was announced after a Renault board meeting. \u201cToday was an important day for the future of the Renault-Nissan Alliance,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter months of discussions, I am happy to say that an agreement has been reached that builds on our heritage and strong foundations to achieve further sustainable growth and success of the two partners. \u201cWhile there were important short-term issues to address, it was imperative that all involved took a long view. We now look forward to all parties returning their focus to day-to-day operations to pursue sustainable growth for Renault and Nissan and to increase performance through additional Alliance synergies.\u201d The deal will be a relief to the workforce of more than 6,000 people at Nissan\u2019s plant in Sunderland, given the concerns that the French government could use its influence to move production from the plant to France. It is understood that Nissan will have the right to increase its stake in Renault to 25% if the French government or Renault breach the terms of the agreement. The alliance accounts for one in 10 cars sold around the world, but since 1999 Nissan has grown significantly faster than its French partner. Some analysts expressed disappointment that the new agreement did not involve the alliance being radically overhauled. Dominic O\u2019Brien, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said: \u201cThere has arguably never been a better time for Renault-Nissan to push through material changes to its structure. It would be a very disappointing outcome if Ghosn is unable to use the current state of affairs to deliver this change.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "IMF boss Christine Lagarde says she wants Britain to stay in EU", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The managing director of the International Monetary Fund has said she wants Britain to stay in the EU, warning that a looming Brexit referendum posed a risk to the UK economy. In an upbeat assessment, Christine Lagarde said the UK was enjoying strong growth, record employment and had largely recovered from the global financial crisis. Presenting the IMF\u2019s annual healthcheck of the economy alongside George Osborne, Lagarde said there were risks to the outlook, including from the housing market, but she was generally positive. \u201cThe UK authorities have managed to repair the damage of the crisis in a way few other countries have been able to do,\u201d she said. Lagarde said the IMF would work through various scenarios for the EU referendum outcome in its next assessment of the UK in May 2016. \u201cOn a personal basis \u2026 I am very, very much hopeful that the UK stays within the EU,\u201d she added. Separately, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s reiterated a warning on Friday that leaving the EU could cost the UK its top credit score. The chancellor said the IMF\u2019s latest assessment of the UK \u201ccould hardly be more positive\u201d. He added that in the past the IMF had been critical of the government\u2019s strategy, such as when it called for higher spending on public investment. \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve been attending this article IV press conference, it has sometimes been controversial, as people pointed to the differences between our plan and the IMF\u2019s advice,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cToday the IMF could not be clearer. They say that our economy is stronger, more resilient and has more jobs. The IMF believe our approach to fixing the public finances is appropriate and transparent. \u201cThis is the strongest IMF assessment of the UK economy in the five years I have been doing this job. I take this as an endorsement of our plan to fix the roof while the sun is shining.\u201d The IMF, which is based in Washington, also used its assessment to recommend that interest rates remain at their record low of 0.5% until there were clearer signs of inflationary pressures. Its report on the UK was delayed for six months due to the general election. The UK\u2019s recent economic performance had been strong and \u201cconsiderable progress\u201d had been made in tackling underlying problems, the IMF said. While forecasting that annual growth would continue to average just over 2% for the next few years, the IMF said there were a number of risks to its \u201cbroadly positive outlook\u201d. \u201cHouse price growth has eased somewhat over the past year, but remains high,\u201d the IMF said. It added that government reforms had made mortgage lenders more resilient, but expressed concern about the ratio of household debt to income, which had left some households \u201cvulnerable to income and interest rate shocks\u201d. Noting that the Bank of England might need to take further action to cool the housing market, the IMF said small-scale buy-to-let landlords could be \u201crelatively exposed\u201d if expected returns did not materialise. Tougher limits on home-loan-to-income ratios or loan-to-value caps might be needed from the Bank, it said. \u201cThe authorities should extend the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee\u2019s powers of direction to the buy-to-let market to mirror those they currently have over the owner-occupied market. In addition, the authorities should continue to monitor the parameters of the help-to-buy programme and consider if they need to be adjusted.\u201d The IMF also highlighted Britain\u2019s poor productivity record and the size of the twin budget and current account deficits. \u201cThe current account deficit is similarly not a result of funding a household credit boom, but nonetheless is strikingly large. Notwithstanding a flexible exchange rate and independent monetary policy, confidence shocks could reduce external capital flows into the UK, which could adversely affect growth,\u201d it said. Osborne said the government was trying to address the challenges identified by the IMF. \u201cYes, there are still risks. The IMF have identified the risks, and they are the same risks we\u2019ve identified and are taking action to prevent,\u201d he added. The Fund\u2019s worries about referendum uncertainty weighing on the UK economy coincided with a fresh warning on Brexit from S&amp;P. The only big ratings agency to still give Britain the top ranking said David Cameron\u2019s decision to hold a referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017 represented a risk to the UK\u2019s financial services sector, its exports, and the wider economy. S&amp;P cut its outlook for UK government debt to \u201cnegative\u201d from \u201cstable\u201d in June and reiterated that stance last night. The outlook means it sees at least a one-in-three chance that the UK will lose its AAA rating over the next two years. Explaining the stance in an update to financial markets, S&amp;P said: \u201cA \u2018leave\u2019 vote is likely to hurt confidence, investment, and GDP growth, with likely negative effects on public finances. As a consequence, a UK departure from the EU would likely lead us to lower the rating.\u201d",

In addition, the authorities should continue to monitor the parameters of the help-to-buy programme and consider if they need to be adjusted.\u201d <br></p> <p>The IMF also highlighted Britain\u2019s poor productivity record and the size of the twin budget and current account deficits. \u201cThe current account deficit is similarly not a result of funding a household credit boom, but nonetheless is strikingly large. Notwithstanding a flexible exchange rate and independent monetary policy, confidence shocks could reduce external capital flows into the UK, which could adversely affect growth,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Osborne said the government was trying to address the challenges identified by the IMF. \u201cYes, there are still risks. The IMF have identified the risks, and they are the same risks we\u2019ve identified and are taking action to prevent,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The Fund\u2019s worries about referendum uncertainty weighing on the UK economy coincided with a fresh warning on Brexit from S&amp;P.</p> <p>The only big ratings agency to still give Britain the top ranking said David Cameron\u2019s decision to hold a referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017 represented a risk to the UK\u2019s financial services sector, its exports, and the wider economy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/12/standard-and-poors-cuts-uk-outlook-amid-eu-referendum-warning\">S&amp;P cut its outlook for UK government debt to \u201cnegative\u201d from \u201cstable\u201d in June and reiterated that stance last night</a>. The outlook means it sees at least a one-in-three chance that the UK will lose its AAA rating over the next two years.</p> <p>Explaining the stance in an update to financial markets, S&amp;P said: \u201cA \u2018leave\u2019 vote is likely to hurt confidence, investment, and GDP growth, with likely negative effects on public finances. As a consequence, a UK departure from the EU would likely lead us to lower the rating.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The City was left nursing its losses after a week of turmoil in commodity and stock markets that wiped \u00a373bn off the value of UK shares. Oil prices were in freefall on Friday, a fresh day of turbulence that followed a forecast from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that a glut of crude will persist for another year. Crude prices continued falling in New York after London\u2019s FTSE 100 closed 135.27 points down at 5,952.78 \u2013 its lowest level since late September. Dealers said the markets had been unsettled by concerns about the health of the Chinese economy, which has needed large quantities of fuel and raw materials for its rapid industrial growth, and the likelihood that the US Federal Reserve will next week raise interest rates for the first time in nine years. The value of China\u2019s currency, the yuan, fell to a four-and-a-half-year low in anticipation that the Fed will act on Wednesday. Gloom was deepened by news of the liquidation of Third Avenue, the biggest failure of a US mutual fund since the financial crisis of 2008. Third Avenue specialised in high-risk junk bonds and its closure amid mounting losses prompted speculation that other firms could also be in trouble as a result of tumbling markets. The failure by the Opec oil cartel to announce production curbs on 4 December triggered the fall in the cost of crude, with knock-on effects on share prices. Saudi Arabia has been willing to tolerate a lower oil price as part of its campaign to kill off the US shale sector, and the markets are also braced for Iranian oil to hit the commodity markets following the end of the west\u2019s sanctions. Falling oil prices are being seen as the result of the combination of excessive supply and weak global demand. Mining and energy companies such as Anglo American and BP were once again among the biggest losers on a day that saw only three shares in the FTSE finish higher. London\u2019s 2.22% drop \u2013 the seventh in a row \u2013 was mirrored by a 2.4% loss in Germany\u2019s Dax index. Shares on the Paris bourse dropped 1.8%. During morning trading on Wall Street, a barrel of benchmark Brent crude was changing hands at $37.68 \u2013 down 5% on the day and the lowest level for seven years. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 300 points by noon in New York. With some analysts predicting crude could hit $30 a barrel over the coming weeks, falling oil prices are likely to keep inflation lower than the Bank of England has been expecting. The City expects November\u2019s consumer prices index, due out on Tuesday, to show a slight positive turn, from -0.1% to 0.1%. The first signs of the impact of plunging oil prices on the cost of living emerged on Friday as supermarkets cut the cost of petrol to below \u00a31 a litre. The IEA, which advises developed states on energy policies, said the glut was likely to continue. \u201cWorld oil markets will remain oversupplied at least until late 2016 \u2026 although the pace of global stock builds should roughly halve next year,\u201d it said in its monthly report. It added: \u201cAs extra Iranian oil hits the market, inventories are expected to swell by 300m barrels. Concerns about reaching storage capacity appear to be overblown. \u201cMuch of the excess oil will be soaked up by 230m barrels of new storage capacity additions, while US inventories are only 70% full. As inventories continue to swell into 2016, there will still be a lot of oil weighing on the market.\u201d Analysts said solid growth in retail sales in the US had removed one of the final obstacles to a tightening of policy, although in September a widely anticipated Fed move was delayed as a result of the last bout of severe global turbulence. Chris Beauchamp, the senior market analyst at IG, the online trading company, said: \u201cOnce again China concerns have spiked just as a Fed rate decision looms. Continued yuan devaluation has been the main driver this time, but it has combined with the ongoing rout in oil and other commodity prices to produce a week of losses for equities.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A sharp decline in new home building by housing associations and local authorities this year could wreck the government\u2019s plans to build 1m new homes by 2020. Housebuilding by the public sector slumped in October, according to official figures, adding to a series of month-on-month falls going back to the election that undermine minister\u2019s claims of a revolution in house building. George Osborne told MPs in his autumn statement last month that measures to support housebuilding would add 400,000 affordable homes by 2020. His comments followed a claim by housing minister Brandon Lewis that a successful housing policy would result \u201cin a total of something like a million homes\u201d by the end of the parliament. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said the downturn was the combination of several factors, including the chancellor\u2019s decision in his first budget of the new parliament to cut housing association rents by 1%. \u201cRents were cut by 1% in the July budget and that meant housing associations had to look again at their budgets,\u201d said a spokesman. He said new home building also suffered from the impact of the government\u2019s three-year funding cycle for housing associations, which creates a boom and bust in the sector. The latest cycle came to an end in the spring. A new funding plan runs to 2018, but homes due to be built under this latest scheme have only just been commissioned, causing a long period of low activity over the summer. \u201cIt would support housebuilding if funding was over a long period than the current three years because there would be greater certainty. It is this factor and the 1% rent cut that have undermined certainty,\u201d he said. Osborne also announced a right-to-buy scheme that will force housing associations to sell homes to tenants for below market prices. The federation said that this decision would also force housing assocations to review their finances, but had probably not yet affected the level of building. The lack of public sector building since the banking crash has already left a huge shortfall in new homes. Fewer than 460,000 homes were built between 2011 and 2014, despite forecasts that 974,000 houses were needed. The ONS said public housing output dropped from \u00a3458m in April to \u00a3361m in October. Output by the private sector has remained flat during the same period at around \u00a32bn. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, warned that the government\u2019s austerity measures were hitting public spending on construction across the industry. He said infrastructure spending was 3.6% below the average for the last three months, new public housing was 1.4% lower and other public construction was 2.6% lower. \u201cThe fiscal squeeze will only intensify over the next year, constraining the growth of the construction sector. Meanwhile, the low level of construction orders in Q3, unchanged from their level a year ago, indicates that the underlying trend in output is likely to be flat over coming quarters,\u201d he said A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cInvesting in Britain\u2019s long term infrastructure needs was at the heart of the spending review, where the chancellor committed to investing \u00a3100bn into major building projects over the next five years.\u201d \u201cThe chancellor has said that the failure to build enough houses has been one of the great social failures of our age, and that\u2019s why we have doubled the housing budget from 2018-19, setting out the most ambitious plan since the 70s to build homes, including delivering 400,000 affordable homes as well as further reforms to help get more houses built.\u201d Campbell Robb, Shelter\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThese figures highlight a worrying downward trend in the number of new homes that people on low or average incomes can actually afford. \u201cIt\u2019s been encouraging to see the government finally acknowledging our housing crisis, but schemes geared towards better-off first-time buyers can\u2019t replace investment in genuinely affordable homes to rent or buy. \u201cThis is further compounded by the extension of right to buy, funded by the forced sale of thousands of council homes, which will further deplete the number of homes available for people on lower incomes.\u201d",

No \u2013 once again they get it wrong, as Ed Miliband did when talking about \u201cpredatory capitalism\u201d rather than highlighting the value of businesses that are run ethically and setting out plans to protect them from race-to-the-bottom firms such as Sports Direct and Amazon. John McDonnell\u2019s reported remarks are in the same vein: quite rightly outraged about abuses, but adopting a negative, accusatory tone rather than emphasising that most businessmen are not like Mike Ashley and do not need government to keep them in check. The key is in the one major weakness of capitalism, which is that it has an obvious built-in mechanism that undermines good employers; and the only answer to this is legislation such as the Factory Acts. An alliance between government and \u201cgood\u201d capitalism was prominent in checking the worst abuses of the factory system during the first industrial revolution. What we have here is a similar situation, and a huge opportunity for the opposition. Jeremy Cushing Exeter \u2022 The refusal of British capital to invest in British industry, preferring to rely on cheap imported labour and old technology, is one of the great economic mysteries and is clearly now as dominant in parts of the retail business as it was in the now largely defunct manufacturing sector. Working in a further education college in Wolverhampton in the 60s and 70s, teaching young apprentices, I remember a foundry still in operation that had once made cannon in the Napoleonic wars, and still using the same technology; skilled workers making motor cycle engines using second world war machine tools in competition with Japanese companies with automated production lines; and men hand-rolling steel bars in a steelworks in Wednesbury. And these antiquated practices have an even longer history back into the 19th century. It is almost as if, having binged on innovation in the industrial revolution, British capital simply laid back and rested on its laurels, content to make its living by rent-seeking and asset-stripping, activities very much alive today throughout the so-called financial services sector with its short-sighted preoccupation with quarterly returns. Roy Boffy Walsall \u2022 Your report on conditions at Sports Direct contained references to employment lawyers which suggest wilful ignorance of conditions under which zero hours employees work. My sister-in-law until recently worked as a domiciliary care worker, for which she was paid marginally over the minimum wage for the time when visiting clients. She was required to use her own car and was paid 25p per mile for travelling between clients but was not paid travelling time, which on occasion exceeded the time while actually engaged on a call. A zero-hours contract can of course result in adjustments to hours of employment offered to troublesome employees who might ultimately be represented as having made themselves unemployed with consequent financial censure. This, more than anything, discourages these groups of staff from speaking out. I drew this Dickensian situation to my MP who referred it to the minister for work and pensions, who declared it to be illegal but offered no other response or action. I hope that your having given such prominence to the Sports Direct situation points to your intention of raising the profile of these deplorable employment conditions. There would currently seem to be little prospect of living wage conditions being applied when the legal minimum wage is so easily circumvented. William Hall Nottingham \u2022 The shadow chancellor\u2019s call for a full investigation by HMRC of Sports Direct (Report, 11 December) shows how out of touch Labour is with what is going on in HMRC. The number of staff dedicated to employer compliance has declined sharply in the last five years due to the government\u2019s policy of cuts to the department. And with HMRC\u2019s plans to close most of its offices nationwide, it is even less likely that such investigations will be undertaken. Ian Arnott (ex-HMRC) Peterborough \u2022 Jeremy Hunt claimed that tax credit cuts would make the British work as hard as the Chinese (Report, 5 October). And lo, it came to pass that Mike Ashley has been doing just that, presumably leading the way forward for companies that need to further enrich the 1% by exploiting the poor. Dr Kenneth Spencer Hull \u2022 I find it surprising, no, astonishing that the Guardian can publish an entire editorial about the low-wage, no-workers-rights economy and not once mention trade unions.

      "bodyText": "Britain can claim 1 million more creative workers than France, and has more than a fifth of the creative staff in the EU, research shows. But the UK lags behind Sweden, which has won the accolade as the European economy with the highest proportion of creative workers. The report by Nesta, an independent thinktank, shows that Britain has succeeded more than most countries in the EU in developing a creative workforce. These jobs are not just in hi-tech firms or the arts, but cover advertising and marketing, the media, architecture and the design industries. A car designer working in the West Midlands is as much a creative worker as a museum curator or app designer for a tech startup for the purposes of the study. Whatever the role, creative staff are better insulated from creeping automation and the increasing use of robots in the workplace. For this reason the UK, Sweden and the Netherlands, which was also near the top of the list, are best placed to weather the hollowing out of manufacturing and the loss of administrative white-collar jobs. The research found that the creative industries employ 11.4 million people in the EU, or 5% of the total workforce, and 2.3 million in the UK. However, Sweden has the highest proportion of its workforce employed in the creative industries at 8.9%, followed by Finland on 8.2% and the UK on 7.6%. Sweden also has the highest proportion of creative workers employed in the broader economy at 12%, compared with 9.5% in the UK. Hasan Bakhshi, director of creative economy at Nesta, said the UK\u2019s consistently high-achieving universities and openness to new ideas combined with tax breaks for new technology start-ups and the arts played an important role in the development of creative jobs. He said: \u201cBritain punches above it\u2019s weight. If you tot up the jobs in the creative industries and the number of people in creative roles in the wider economy, you find that while UK jobs account for 14% of the EU\u2019s total workforce, it has 21% of all creative jobs.\u201d Bakhshi has warned in previous reports that developed economies are vulnerable to a huge loss of jobs from automation unless they promote investment in creative businesses. In the autumn statement last month, George Osborne described cuts to the creative industries as a false economy. After the chancellor limited cuts to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to 20% from an expected 40%, he said: \u201cOne of the best investments we can make as a nation is in our extraordinary arts, museums, heritage, media and sport.\u201d Bakhshi said support by previous governments to the film industry and the BBC had played an important role in attracting investment to the UK in creative businesses. But he criticised the recent focus on Stem subjects in schools that favour science technology, engineering and maths. Nesta favours the acronym Steam, which includes the arts. \u201cSweden has a strong design tradition and an understanding among policymakers of the role it can play in the economy\u2019s development. This goes back a long way. Stem misses a trick, which is marrying art, design and technology. The government hasn\u2019t really cottoned on to the significance.\u201d The OECD, the Paris-based thinktank, has made similar criticisms of Sweden and the UK school education systems, arguing that their quality has slumped in recent years. Critics of the UK government\u2019s funding for universities have also voiced concerns that creative courses could be starved of cash. Nesta says the report, Creative Economy Employment in the UK and the EU, is the first \u201cconsistent estimate of the size of the creative industries in all 28 EU countries and the wider \u2018creative economies\u2019 of 20 countries for which data is available\u201d. The researchers also found that between 2011 and 2013 the UK\u2019s creative industry jobs grew at 6.1% on average each year, compared with the EU\u2019s 1.8%. \u201cOf the three largest EU economies \u2013 the UK, Germany and France \u2013 the UK was the fastest growing. Germany grew on average 1.6% each year while France saw its creative industry workforce fall by -1.7% per annum during this period,\u201d the report said.",

    "webTitle": "Diesel power companies given big tax breaks under Osborne\u2019s energy regime", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wealthy investors will earn millions from polluting diesel generators \u2013 and get lucrative tax breaks for doing so \u2013 under the government\u2019s energy regime. So-called \u201cdiesel farms\u201d won contracts worth \u00a3175.5m to make power available to the National Grid as part of the capacity market auction that ended late on Thursday. One of the major beneficiaries is Rockpool Investments, a private equity firm set up and chaired by former City fund manager Nicola Horlick, who is estimated to be worth \u00a320m. The National Grid contracts provide a guaranteed payment of more than \u00a35m for standing ready to provide power when needed, with more payments made when they are called upon. On top of that income, the companies also qualify for tax relief that allows investors to slash their income tax bills. Two of the diesel firms that won 15-year contracts to provide energy capacity from 2019 are Balance Power and Attune Energy. Both count Rockpool Investments among their major investors. Rockpool\u2019s website tells investors that both companies will operate \u201cconventional diesel engines to provide standby power\u201d. It says the projects will \u201cqualify for tax reliefs under the Enterprise Investment Scheme\u201d, or EIS. Another section of the Rockpool website informs wealthy investors that EIS schemes \u201creduce your income tax bill by 30p for every \u00a31 invested\u201d. Investors also do not have to pay capital gains tax when they sell a stake in a project that qualifies under the scheme. Rockpool did not respond to a request for comment. EIS\u2019s stated mission is to \u201chelp smaller higher-risk trading companies to raise finance\u201d. Greenpeace\u2019s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said: \u201cThis new subsidy scheme has become a money spinner for wealthy individuals who are making a fast buck on polluting energy at the expense of bill payers and people\u2019s health. \u201cBritain\u2019s 21st-century economy deserves a flexible, modern, clean energy infrastructure, and what it gets is pop-up diesel farms and coal plants past their sell-by date. There\u2019s an expanding void at the heart of the government\u2019s energy policy, and these stopgap measures do very little to hide it.\u201d Horlick is also linked to another big winner from the diesel bonanza: the Plutus Energy chief executive, Phil Stephens. He is listed among Balance Power shareholders, while Plutus Energy has invested alongside Rockpool in Attune Energy. Plutus Energy was awarded a separate contract to provide 20MW of capacity a year over the next 15 years, also using diesel generators. It is also understood to have qualified for EIS tax relief. Dale Vince, the founder of green energy provider Ecotricity, lambasted a system that has handed new subsidies to diesel and extended funding for other fossil fuels. \u201cWhen the capacity market begins paying out, around a billion pounds a year will be added to household energy bills to subsidise old coal, old gas and dirty diesel generators \u2013 just to sit on standby,\u201d Vince said. \u201cThat\u2019s more than is paid to support onshore windmills to actually supply over 5% of all electricity. And quite incredibly diesel engines also get a special 30% tax break. Why on earth that should be, perhaps only George Osborne knows. \u201cThis comes in the same week that VAT on wind, solar and energy efficiency products is increased from 5% to 20%. Tax breaks for fossil fuels and more tax on renewables: that\u2019s becoming the pattern of this government.\u201d Another of the big winners from diesel is Prime Energy Development, which succeeded with bids for seven diesel farms providing 20MW of power each over 15 years. Prime Energy is jointly owned by Watt Power and international commodities group Noble, which has a majority stake.

      "bodyText": "Another plunge in the oil price after the International Energy Agency forecast oversupply until the end of next year, further falls in commodity companies on worries about Chinese demand, and nervousness about a US rate hike from the Federal Reserve next week combined to send global stock markets sharply lower. Energy companies and mining shares were among the biggest fallers, while companies with interests in South Africa, such as Old Mutual, were also under pressure after the sudden departure of the country\u2019s finance minister earlier in the week. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 135.27 points or 2.22% lower at 5952.78, with the UK\u2019s leading index losing \u00a373bn of value of the course of the week Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.44% to 10,340.06 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.84% lower at 4549.56 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.84% to 21,015.29 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.5% at 9630.7 In Greece, the Athens market edged up 0.31% to 578.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 303 points or 1.7%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again on Monday. Months after devaluing its currency, China has issued an index of the yuan against a basket of currencies, rather than the dollar which it has been pegged to for a number of years. The yuan fell to a four year low against the dollar earlier, but the People\u2019s Bank of China said it would make sense for it to be compared to a basket of currencies, as was the case elsewhere. It said the yuan had performed well against the basket: The index is 102.93 on November 30, appreciated 2.93% from the end of 2014. This shows that, even though renminbi [yuan] has depreciated against US dollar since the beginning of this year, it has appreciated modestly against a basket of currencies. Therefore, the renminbi is relatively a strong currency among the major international currencies. Following the earlier figures for Volkswager passenger cars, the company has now said its total sales for January to November this year - including Audi, Porsche and commercial vehicles - were 9.1m, down 1.7%. For November, total sales fell 2.2% compared to the same time last year. There is a chance the current market slump could persuade the US Federal Reserve not to raise rates next week, suggests Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, but this would undoubtedly damage the central bank\u2019s credibility. He said: Once again China concerns have spiked just as a Fed rate decision looms. Continued yuan devaluation has been the main driver this time, but it has combined with the ongoing rout in oil and other commodity prices to produce a week of losses for equities. Just a week ago the situation had seemed relatively calm, but it now appears that many investors have been trying to put a brave face on the situation. Now that mask has slipped. It goes without saying that the Fed is not meant to take notice of market turmoil in its decisions, but if it feels that the international situation once again calls for it to stay its hand next week, then we could be witnessing a re-run of September. Leaving aside the damage that this will do to the Fed\u2019s credibility (potentially putting Janet Yellen into the \u2018unreliable partner\u2019 category currently only occupied by Mark Carney), it will be hard for the central bank to put a positive spin on any decision not to increase rates. Seasonality suggests the Santa rally will finally start to kick in from next week, but the strength and duration of that depends largely on Janet Yellen. She has a big week ahead of her. Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott\u2019s report on the market declines: A week of turmoil on the world\u2019s financial markets has ended on a downbeat note after a fresh plunge in oil prices triggered sharp stock market falls. Amid fears that a glut in crude oil will persist for another 12 months, the cost of a barrel of benchmark Brent crude slid by more than 2% on Friday to trade at just under $39 a barrel \u2013 its lowest for almost seven years. In London, the FTSE 100 index crashed through the 6,000 barrier, and was down by more than 100 points in early afternoon trading. The gloomy mood in the City was echoed on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average opened more than 250 points lower. Mining shares were among the hardest hit as stock exchanges fell for the seventh day in a row. Stock markets have been affected by renewed weakness in the price of oil caused by fears that global demand is insufficient to soak up the supply of crude from oil producing countries. The International Energy Agency, which advises developed states on energy policies, said the glut was likely to continue. \u201cWorld oil markets will remain oversupplied at least until late 2016 \u2026 although the pace of global stock builds should roughly halve next year, \u201d the IEA said in its monthly report. Full story here: The rout on stock markets could get worse, certainly as far as the FTSE 100 is concerned, says analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex: [This is] the first time the UK index has been below 6000 since the end of September and marks the end of one of the worst weeks for the commodity-laden index in an already trouble-filled 2015. What is worrying is that this weekend brings with it the latest Chinese industrial production data, the kind of figure that, if it underperforms expectations, may only help escalate this current commodity collapse. US consumer confidence has come in slightly lower than expected in the preliminary data for December, but still increased from last month\u2019s figure. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose from 91.3 in November to 91.8 so far this month. This was below the 92 figure expected by economists. US shares have followed other global markets lower in early trading on Wall Street, and the commodity crunch continues to unnerve investors. With oil tumbling again - Brent crude is currently down nearly 2% to $38.99 a barrel after the International Energy Agency warned of oversupply until at least the end of next shares - shares are following suit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 223 points or 1.27% while the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.9% to 5972, its lowest since late September. Shares with connections to South Africa are among the fallers in London following the departure of the country\u2019s finance minister earlier in the week, while mining shares continue to be weak amid concerns about falling demand from China. Investors are also remaining cautious ahead of the probable US interest rate hike next week The effects of the emissions scandal on Volkswagen sales are shown by new sales figures from the company. So far this year - from January to November - the company has sold 5.34m passenger cars, down 4.5% on the same period last year. The fall in November was 2.4% compared to the same month in 2014. Board member J\u00fcrgen Stackmann said the current trend was expected to continue for the rest of the year: Developments in world markets, which are in some cases tense, and their effects on the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand will continue until the end of the year... In view of the situation of the brand, which is currently challenging, I do not expect that we will be able to compensate for this fall in the remaining days of the year. Last VW sold 6.12 million cars across the world. As far as the emissions scandal was concerned, Stackmann said that the main focus was on solutions which were as customer-friendly as possible. The implementation of the measures is to start in January and will probably continue throughout 2016. \u201cFor our customers, we want to keep the time needed to implement the technical measures as short as possible. Via our dealers, we will be contacting each of our customers and will do everything in our power to take individual customers\u2019 needs into consideration in the implementation of the technical measures in order to avoid any disadvantages such as possible mobility restrictions.\u201d On Thursday VW said the scandal was the result of a collection of failures within the company. Despite the US retail sales making a rate rise from the Federal Reserve next week even more likely, the underlying trend may be weakening, according to Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. He said: Core retail sales, which strip out volatile spending on cars and fuel, as well as building and food services, rose 0.6% to register the largest monthly increase since May. Overall retail sales rose 0.2% in November, missing expectations of a slightly stronger 0.3% rise but nevertheless signalling the best increase since July. The data will no doubt be seen as further encouragement to policymakers who have already signalled their intent to hike interest rates next week for the first time in nine years. However, the data also suggest that the underlying spending trend could be waning, which adds to the view that spending is not galloping away and the Fed will need to be cautious in timing future hikes, pointing to a gently rate trajectory path. The 0.7% rise in sales so far on the fourth quarter compares with a 1.1% rise in the third quarter and a 1.2% increase in the second quarter. In fact, barring the weather-torn first quarter, core sales growth is on course to be the weakest for almost two years. Markit\u2019s PMI data also show a deteriorating trend in new orders at factories that produce consumer goods, suggesting retailers are buying few goods from wholesalers, most likely due to weaker than expected sales. While consumer have benefitted from low inflation and falling fuel prices, the prospect of higher interest rates may be starting to have an impact on people\u2019s propensity to spend. ING economist Rob Carnell said the US retail sales numbers were \u201cbetter than good enough for a December rate hike\u201d. Markets are already pricing in a very high chance of a hike at next week\u2019s meeting, so we anticipate that impacts on the dollar, and bond yields will be minor, even though the result was on balance a little better than expected. But it was given an extra nudge in the same direction by slightly stronger November producer price data, perhaps an indicator of what we might expect at next week\u2019s consumer price index release too.\u201d Producer price figures, also out just now, showed a 0.3% gain in November after a 0.4% decline in October, as the cost of services increased. They were stronger than expected, and the dollar rose on both sets of figures. Overall retail sales increased only 0.2%, with automobile sales down and cheaper petrol also having an impact. Clothing retailers reported 0.8% sales growth, the biggest increase since May, as did sports and hobby stores. Sales at online retailers, and at electronics and appliance chains, were up 0.6%. The holiday shopping season got off to a good start in the US. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.6% in November from the month before, more than expected. In October, core retail sales rose by 0.2%, according to the Commerce Department. Consumer spending surprisingly slowed in September and October. The latest figures will bolster expectations of a Fed rate hike next Wednesday. Shares in the UK and Europe have fallen further. FTSE 100 index down 1.3% at 6008.18 Dax down 1.9% at 10,398.46 CAC down 1.5% at 4563.56 US retail sales figures are due shortly. Tesco has just announced that its UK personnel director Judith Nelson has left the supermarket chain, the second veteran director to resign this week. Nelson quit after 22 years at the retailer. She will be replaced by Natasha Adams, the business support director. Nelson\u2019s departure comes after the resignation of Jill Easterbrook, the group business transformation director, on Monday. Tesco\u2019s woes continue to deepen. Its shares hit an 18-year low this week as investors fretted about the strength of its Christmas trading. In October, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer posted a 55% fall in first-half pretax profits. Here is our full story on the IMF. Osborne was delighted with the IMF\u2019s latest assessment of the UK, saying it \u201ccould hardly be more positive\u201d. Using one of his favourite catchphrases, he said: I take this as an endorsement of our plan to fix the roof while the sun is shining.\u201d My colleagues on the economics desk Larry Elliott and Katie Allen, who are at the Treasury, write: IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said she wanted Britain to stay in the European Union as the Washington-based organisation highlighted a looming Brexit referendum as a risk to the strongly performing UK economy. In an upbeat assessment, the Fund said the UK was enjoying strong growth, record employment and had largely repaired damage from the global financial crisis. Presenting the IMF\u2019s annual healthcheck of the UK economy alongside chancellor George Osborne, Lagarde said there were risks to the outlook, including from the housing market, but she was generally positive. \u201cThe UK authorities have managed to repair the damage of the crisis in a way few other countries have been able to do,\u201d she said. Lagarde said the IMF will work through various scenarios for the EU referendum outcome in its next assessment of the UK due in May 2016. But she added: \u201cOn a personal basis\u2026 I am very very much hopeful that the UK stays within the EU.\u201d The fund called on the Bank of England to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5% until signs of stronger inflationary pressures emerge. It suggested property tax reform to the government to ease Britain\u2019s chronic housing shortage. For example, rebalancing taxation away from transactions and towards property values could boost mobility and facilitate more efficient use of the housing stock. Reducing council tax discounts for single-occupant properties could also increase the utilization of these properties.\u201d The IMF praised George Osborne\u2019s envisaged path to deficit reduction as \u201csmoother\u201d than at this time last year. The fund says: The autumn statement appropriately targets steady declines in the deficit and the achievement of a small surplus by 2019/20. However, it warned the chancellor: In the event of an extended period of sluggish demand growth, the flexibility in the fiscal framework should be used to modify the pace of structural adjustment. In addition, the envisaged reductions in some categories of expenditure remain sizable, and the government may need to show flexibility in finding alternative fiscal measures if anticipated efficiency gains fail to materialize.\u201d Here is the IMF\u2019s latest assessment on the UK economy. The Washington-based fund concludes that The UK\u2019s recent economic performance has been strong, and considerable progress has been achieved in addressing underlying vulnerabilities. Steady growth looks likely to continue over the next few years, and inflation should gradually return to target.\u201d However, the IMF highlights several risks, namely Housing market: It says that while house price growth has eased somewhat over the past year, it remains high. The share of households borrowing at high loan to income multiples has come down, but after initial declines the household debt to income ratio has stabilised at a high level, \u201cleaving some households vulnerable to income and interest rate shocks\u201d The current account deficit is \u201cstrikingly large\u201d. \u201cConfidence shocks could reduce external capital flows into the UK, which could adversely affect growth\u201d The 2014/15 fiscal deficit was nearly 5% of GDP, with government debt at 87% of GDP. \u201cWhile the UK continues to benefit from record low interest rates, maintaining deficits and debts at these levels would constrain the space to respond proactively to future large negative growth shocks.\u201d Productivity growth: the expected pick-up to nearer its historical average rate \u201cmay fail to materialise\u201d. Uncertainty over the planned referendum on EU membership Here\u2019s our full story on Sports Direct. Sports Direct shares have fallen for a second day after the Guardian\u2019s investigation into its pay and working conditions and poor financial results, my colleague Nick Fletcher writes. This has wiped millions of pounds more off the value of the company and founder Mike Ashley\u2019s stake. Chris Williamson, chief economist at industry survey compiler Markit, says: The October upturn goes some way to bringing the recent official data more into line with the Markit/CIPS PMI data, which have shown the construction sector enjoying a good year so far in 2015, albeit with the rate of expansion cooling in recent months, led by a slowing of house building. The official construction data are notoriously volatile and prone to revision, so we treat the numbers with due caution.\u201d Meanwhile, the official UK construction figures for October were weaker than expected. Output rose by 0.2% from September, far less than the 1% increase City analysts had predicted. Britain\u2019s construction industry accounts for 6% of total economic output and was a drag on growth in the third quarter, when the economy was powered entirely by the services sector. The Office for National Statistics revised up its estimate for construction output in the third quarter to show a drop of 1.9% compared with a 2.2% fall previously, but this will have little impact on the overall GDP numbers. More worryingly, housebuilding has been revised lower to show a quarterly decline of 5.6% in the third quarter \u2013 its biggest drop since early 2009. UK housebuilder Bellway has seen its shares jump 4.3%, making it the best performer on the FTSE 250 index, after the company said it would build 10% more homes in the year to 31 July. Broker Peel Hunt raised its target price on the shares to \u00a328.90 from \u00a328.20. Numis raised its target price to \u00a328.60. Back to oil prices: the International Energy Agency sees the oil glut worsening in coming months as demand growth slows. It is predicting that global oil markets will remain oversupplied until at least the end of next year. Additional output from Iran when/if western sanctions on the country are removed will put more oil on the market. Oil prices have fallen to near seven-year lows, below $40 a barrel, this week after the oil cartel OPEC failed to cap its output. The IEA, which advises developed nations on energy policies, said in its monthly report: World oil markets will remain oversupplied at least until late 2016\u2026 although the pace of global stock builds should roughly halve next year.\u201d Banks including Goldman Sachs believe oil prices could fall to as low as $20 a barrel, as the world might run out of capacity to store unused oil. But the IEA said: As extra Iranian oil hits the market, inventories are expected to swell by 300m barrels. Concerns about reaching storage capacity appear to be overblown. Much of the excess oil will be soaked up by 230m barrels of new storage capacity additions, while US inventories are only 70% full. As inventories continue to swell into 2016, there will still be a lot of oil weighing on the market.\u201d Joint house brokers Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have both cut their target price on Sports Direct shares. Citigroup cut its target price to 800p from 900p, while Goldman Sachs went to 725p from 850p, as reported earlier. Sports Direct shares are now down 3.2% at 573.6p, making it the second-biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index, and wiping more than \u00a3100m off the company\u2019s market value. Founder Mike Ashley, who owns a 55% stake in the retailer, took a further \u00a354m hit, following his \u00a3237m loss on Thursday. The stock market as a whole is down in London, by 0.5%. Elsewhere in Europe, shares have fallen near two-month lows on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, which has lost 0.7%. Stock markets are falling for the seventh day in a row. Weak commodity prices, in particular oil, are putting pressure on markets ahead of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting next Wednesday when it is widely expected to hike interest rates. Bubb added: When we got to the presentation room [yesterday] there was no sign of Mike Ashley! Last time the great man was himself late arriving, after a late night session with his property adviser, but he did eventually turn up to delight analysts with his views on online retailing and Europe. This time he seemed to be keeping a low-profile, for perhaps understandable reasons, given the recent bad press, although he apparently was in London for investor meetings later in the day. In Ashley\u2019s absence, the managing director Dave Forsey, along with the new finance director Matt Pearson, tried to explain the weak first-half sales performance. Amazingly, he insisted that even though H1 retail sales were only up by 2.5% on a constant currency basis, UK store LFL sales had been \u201cpositive\u201d, despite an increase in UK selling space of over 10%...but that could only be true if new UK store space has been remarkably unproductive and Europe has been remarkably weak, notably Austria, and if there has been much slower Online growth (down from +14% to +7%, in fact). Asked about the success of rival JD Sports, he envied their ability to get the best new ranges from the branded suppliers...Asked about the lack of more acquisitions in the pipeline, he said that it\u2019s hard to do deals because people know that Sports Direct is a buyer and the asking prices are too high...Asked about the disastrous experience in Austria, he refused to break out the performance, but tried to point people to the much more successful Baltics acquisition.\u201d Independent City analyst Nick Bubb said this morning: Well, the poor PR about Sports Direct\u2019s corporate ethics and governance isn\u2019t helping their cause, but the main reason for the slump in the share price yesterday was concern about weak UK sales and the problems with the recent acquisition in Austria...\u201d Shares in Sports Direct, the retail chain controlled by the billionaire Mike Ashley, have fallen another 3.1% this morning, after Goldman Sachs cut its target price on the stock. The shares tumbled 11% on Thursday, wiping more than \u00a3400m off the market value of Britain\u2019s biggest sportswear retailer. City investors and MPs turned on the company following disappointing financial results and revelations over pay and working conditions unearthed by a Guardian investigation. UK transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin has been on BBC Radio 4 defending the government\u2019s postponement of its decision on whether to allow a third runway at Heathrow airport until next summer, over environmental concerns. Pressed why the government wasn\u2019t making a decision by the end of the year as promised, McLoughlin said that a decision had been made \u2013 of sorts. We\u2019ve come to the conclusion that extra airport capacity is needed.\u201d He said the Airports Commission had looked at 52 different options and three were deemed workable. While the commission\u2019s report recommended a third runway at Heathrow, \u201cit said all three options are viable options,\u201d he noted. The transport secretary said that with regard to air quality, the changes since the report was published needed to be taken into account. Gatwick is still on the table. There could be a second runway at Gatwick.\u201d He added that a decision would be made \u201chopefully in the summer of next year\u201d and this \u201cwould still allow us to get extra capacity by 2030.\u201d Our political correspondent Rowena Mason wrote: Although the delay was widely expected, Cameron immediately faced fury from business groups and accusations from Labour that he had ducked a difficult decision on infrastructure to help the chances of Zac Goldsmith, the Tory London mayoral candidate, who is a fierce opponent of Heathrow expansion. UK and European stocks have opened lower, as expected: FTSE 100 index down 0.2% to 6073.1 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.2% France\u2019s CAC down 0.5% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.3% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.2% Crude oil prices are hovering near levels not seen since early 2009, with Brent crude at $39.65 a barrel (after falling to $39.38 earlier) and US crude at $36.65 a barrel. Richard Gorry, director of consultancy JBC Energy Asia, told Reuters: Can you rule out $20 per barrel? No, you can\u2019t.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, is in London and due to meet the UK chancellor, George Osborne, to present the fund\u2019s latest assessment of the British economy (the concluding statement of the regular Article IV consultation). It will be released at 11.30 GMT. Stock markets in the UK and Europe are set for another weak start to the day, with oil prices still weak and the Chinese yuan at four and a half year lows. OPEC\u2019s monthly report published on Thursday predicted a fall in oil supply from non-OPEC countries next year coupled with an increase in global demand that should underpin prices. The market however was more focused on the short term fact that oil production from OPEC itself hit the highest level in three years in November. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says The near-term outlook for the stock market looks a lot less rosy while oil prices are tanking. Oil prices fell 40% after OPEC\u2019s meeting in November last year, a similar decline this time would mean Brent crude at $25 per barrel. An additional cause for concern over the drop in crude this time is that it may cause a policy error by the Federal Reserve. The Fed looks set to raise interest rates at a time when a fall in the oil prices means inflation could be about to take another leg lower. The Bank of England just highlighted exactly this same risk factor in its meeting minutes.\u201d The main data releases today are UK construction figures at 9.30am GMT and US retail sales at 1.30pm GMT. Lawler says The US retail sales report is the penultimate piece of data that could derail a Fed rate hike with CPI [inflation] released next week. Expectations are for a rise of 0.2% in November up from 0.1% in October with sales ex-autos to rise 0.3%, up from 0.2%.",

Overall retail sales rose 0.2% in November, missing expectations of a slightly stronger 0.3% rise but nevertheless signalling the best increase since July.</p> <p>The data will no doubt be seen as further encouragement to policymakers who have already signalled their intent to hike interest rates next week for the first time in nine years. However, the data also suggest that the underlying spending trend could be waning, which adds to the view that spending is not galloping away and the Fed will need to be cautious in timing future hikes, pointing to a gently rate trajectory path.</p> <p>The 0.7% rise in sales so far on the fourth quarter compares with a 1.1% rise in the third quarter and a 1.2% increase in the second quarter. In fact, barring the weather-torn first quarter, core sales growth is on course to be the weakest for almost two years. Markit\u2019s PMI data also show a deteriorating trend in new orders at factories that produce consumer goods, suggesting retailers are buying few goods from wholesalers, most likely due to weaker than expected sales.</p> <p>While consumer have benefitted from low inflation and falling fuel prices, the prospect of higher interest rates may be starting to have an impact on people\u2019s propensity to spend.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11cf21f58bf9547dd9f4d094522ba65f9d0feb68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11cf21f58bf9547dd9f4d094522ba65f9d0feb68/0_0_587_422/500.jpg\" alt=\"US retail sales\" width=\"500\" height=\"359\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US retail sales</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ecowin</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-566ad259e4b0c8f491ad277e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-11T13:42:13.340Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>ING economist Rob Carnell said the US retail sales numbers were \u201cbetter than good enough for a December rate hike\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets are already pricing in a very high chance of a hike at next week\u2019s meeting, so we anticipate that impacts on the dollar, and bond yields will be minor, even though the result was on balance a little better than expected. </p> <p>But it was given an extra nudge in the same direction by slightly stronger November producer price data, perhaps an indicator of what we might expect at next week\u2019s consumer price index release too.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Producer price figures, also out just now, showed a 0.3% gain in November after a 0.4% decline in October, as the cost of services increased.

The market however was more focused on the short term fact that oil production from OPEC itself hit the highest level in three years in November.</p> <p>Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The near-term outlook for the stock market looks a lot less rosy while oil prices are tanking. Oil prices fell 40% after OPEC\u2019s meeting in November last year, a similar decline this time would mean Brent crude at $25 per barrel. </p> <p>An additional cause for concern over the drop in crude this time is that it may cause a policy error by the Federal Reserve. The Fed looks set to raise interest rates at a time when a fall in the oil prices means inflation could be about to take another leg lower. The Bank of England just highlighted exactly this same risk factor in its meeting minutes.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/statuses/675201482753499137\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our European opening calls:&#10;&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag\">$FTSE</a> 6071 down 17&#10;$DAX\u00a010593 down 6&#10;$CAC\u00a04629 down 6&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag\">$IBEX</a> 9767 down 12&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIB&amp;src=ctag\">$MIB</a> 21416 up 7</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/675201482753499137\">December 11, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The main data releases today are UK construction figures at 9.30am GMT and US retail sales at 1.30pm GMT. </p> <p>Lawler says</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US retail sales report is the penultimate piece of data that could derail a Fed rate hike with CPI [inflation] released next week.

Publishing a consultation paper on the type of capital banks must hold on Friday, the Bank said the big lenders were holding about \u00a3195bn of bonds that could be used to bail them but needed \u00a3223bn to be safe against a potential collapse. By setting what is known as the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), policymakers also hope to reduce the cost of another financial crisis on the economy. The 2008 banking crisis in the UK caused a recession and forced the government to spend \u00a365bn on buying up shares in Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. Mark Carney, Bank governor, said: \u201cThe implementation of MREL is a crucial step forward in ensuring that any bank, large or small, carries sufficient resources to be resolved in an orderly way, without recourse to public subsidy and without disruption to the wider financial system.\u201d MREL is a minimum requirement for institutions to hold shares and debt that can bear losses when a bank runs into trouble. These reserves did not work during the 2008 crisis when the Bank was unable to force bondholders to take losses, requiring the taxpayer to step in instead. \u201cIf the most systemically important institutions have sufficient MREL, then this can help to ensure that the government does not have to use public funds for any bailouts,\u201d the Bank said. It would stop yields on government bonds rising and could mean that the cost of a financial crisis is reduced by between 5.4% and 11.4% of annual GDP. Each of the systemically important banks \u2013 the likes of HSBC and RBS \u2013 would become a third less likely to fail. A bank that would have had a 1.5% probability of failingduring a certain period will now have a 1% probability. The probability of a crisis reduces by 26-41%. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, said banks were likely to complain about the additional capital: \u201cThis might appear an arcane and technical issue, but it matters to every taxpayer in this country. There will be another financial crisis one day. When it comes, it is essential that the taxpayer is not on the hook. The losses caused by bank failure should be borne by investors, not the wider public.\u201d The Bank of England expects to use its powers to demand banks that are on the brink of collapse use their MREL reserves only on institutions with more than 40,000 accounts used for day-to-day payments and cash withdrawals.",

The demise of USC, which was controversially bought straight out of administration by another arm of Sports Direct in January, led to about 200 workers being given just 15 minutes\u2019 warning that they were to lose their jobs. The episode has since seen Sports Direct\u2019s chief executive, David Forsey, charged with a criminal offence for allegedly failing to give the 30 days\u2019 notice required for redundancies under employment law. Forsey denies the charge. Meanwhile, Ashley has been accused of using \u201cdisgraceful and unlawful employment practices\u201d during the incident. The discovery follows the Guardian\u2019s revelations on Wednesday about how the retailer\u2019s temporary warehouse workers are subjected to an extraordinary regime of searches and surveillance, with undercover reporters unearthing evidence that thousands of workers\u2019 pay was effectively below the minimum wage. The company was branded a \u201cscar on British business\u201d by the Institute of Directors, and was criticised by some of its own shareholders. Opposition MPs demanded the company be investigated by HMRC. USC went into administration on 13 January 2015, but the Guardian has obtained documents showing that Sports Direct transferred leases of some USC stores to another wholly owned Sports Direct subsidiary, Republic, during November and December 2014. In November 2014, the lease on USC\u2019s store in Livingston was moved to Republic, while two days before Christmas the leases on USC\u2019s Aberdeen, Doncaster, Dundee, Edinburgh and Hull stores were all transferred in the same manner. A source close to one of the December lease transfers said: \u201cThe change of ownership happened because the USC store was performing quite well and Sports Direct didn\u2019t want to put that into the administration, so they changed the name on the lease to Republic.\u201d Meanwhile, the ownership of USC\u2019s trademark was switched to another Sports Direct company. That change was registered at the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) on 19 December 2014, less than a month before the administration. The transfer of the brand out of USC, which IPO documents say had been agreed in 2011 between the two Sports Direct companies, effectively ensured that Sports Direct was the only possible candidate to buy USC out of administration. The swift in and out administration process had relieved the chain of staff and debts. The collapse of USC caused a huge furore in January over the way Sports Direct had treated staff at its subsidiary and led to a parliamentary inquiry by the Scottish affairs committee in March. At one session, Philip Duffy of USC\u2019s joint administrator, Duff &amp; Phelps, told MPs: \u201cThe only potential purchaser [of USC] I would consider would be a Sports Direct group member because USC only owned the stock in the stores, subject to [licensing restrictions]. It didn\u2019t have any warehouse stock so it couldn\u2019t replenish the stores. It didn\u2019t own the brand, USC. USC [the brand] was owned by Sports Direct.\u201d Duffy told the Guardian: \u201cThe joint administrators have complied with their statutory obligations to file a report with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and have acted in the best interests of all of the creditors of the company.\u201d He declined to make any further comment so as \u201cnot to prejudice any future potential recoveries into the administration estate\u201d. Meanwhile, one insider with direct knowledge of USC told the Guardian that Sports Direct had been transferring leases out of USC and into Republic for months, if not years. He said that landlords who were prepared to renegotiate leases with USC saw their stores transferred out of USC and into Republic, while those who resisted Sports Direct\u2019s efforts to get better terms were left inside USC. \u201cIf a landlord played ball they were OK,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t win against Mike [Ashley].\u201d Republic was granted a new lease on the USC store in Brighton in November 2013, while when USC relocated its Leicester store in March 2014, the leaseholder became Republic, despite the shop being branded as USC. Duffy added: \u201cWe were initially contacted on 14 November 2014 and I am unaware of any prior discussions or planning regarding timetables for an administration appointment.\u201d In October, the Guardian revealed that Forsey had been charged with a criminal offence relating to the collapse of USC. About 200 workers at USC\u2019s warehouse in Dundonald, Ayrshire, lost their jobs \u2013 with 80 permanent warehouse staff arguing they had not been properly consulted. Along with Robert Palmer, a compliance and technical partner at the Gallagher Partnership \u2013 who were joint administrators \u2013 Forsey pleaded not guilty to a charge of failing to notify the business secretary at least 30 days before the warehouse workers were laid off. The offence of failure to notify carries a maximum penalty of \u00a35,000. Both Sports Direct and Gallaghers declined to comment. The next hearing in the case is scheduled at Chesterfield magistrates court in March, while a separate civil conduct investigation was kicked off by BIS in October. BIS has the power to ban somebody from serving as a director for up to 15 years. Timetable leading up to USC administration 14 November 2014: Insolvency firm Gallaghers meets Sports Direct in its role as a secured creditor of its wholly owned subsidiary USC to discuss a debt due. 23 November 2014: USC\u2019s Livingston store is transferred to Republic, another wholly owned Sports Direct company. 17 December 2014: Gallaghers, along with another insolvency firm, Duff &amp; Phelps, meet USC after a statutory demand was issued to USC by one of its creditors (Diesel) for outstanding invoices. The demand had an expiry date of 31 December. 19 December 2014: USC\u2019s trademark registration is transferred out of USC to another company wholly owned by Sports Direct (USC IP Ltd). 23 December 2014: USC\u2019s Aberdeen, Doncaster, Dundee, Edinburgh and Hull stores are all transferred to Republic. 6 January 2015: Notice to appoint an administrator is filed. 13 January 2015: USC enters administration. Only then are 200 warehouse workers given 15 minutes\u2019 notice they are to lose their jobs. Twenty-eight USC stores are sold back to Sports Direct\u2019s Republic subsidiary in the pre-pack administration deal. This article was amended on 12 December 2015. An editing error meant the USC warehouse referred to was described as being in Dundonald, County Antrim. It is in Dundonald, Ayrshire. This has been corrected.",

Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons have slashed the price of petrol this weekend as the oil price tumbles and the supermarket chains battle to attract festive shoppers. The average price of petrol has not fallen below \u00a31 in the UK since 2009, peaking at \u00a31.42 in April 2012. Tesco, the UK\u2019s largest fuel retailer with 500 forecourts, has reduced unleaded to 99.9p and also taken a penny off diesel. Sainsbury\u2019s is doing the same at its 301 forecourts, but petrol at Morrisons has tumbled even lower to 99.7p and diesel to 103.7p. Asda has also joined the Christmas price war with a three-day promotion \u2013 ending on Sunday \u2013 that cuts unleaded to 99.7p and diesel to 103.7p. Tesco\u2019s fuel director, Peter Cattell, said: \u201cWe want to do all we can to help our customers in the run-up to Christmas. We know that our customers really value low fuel prices and that having unleaded for 99.9p a litre will really give customers a boost over the festive period.\u201d The price of Brent crude has fallen below $40 a barrel this week, which is causing chaos for oil groups and miners, but is set to benefit consumers in the short-term at least. The RAC predicted this week that the falling price of oil and the supermarket competition for customers would lead to British drivers paying less than \u00a31 a litre by Christmas. However, motoring organisations called for retailers to slash prices further. Simon Williams, RAC spokesman, said: \u201cAnother promotional cut to enable motorists to buy petrol at under \u00a31 will no doubt bring early Christmas cheer to many, but we would like to see this price being held for longer than three days with oil under $40 a barrel and the wholesale price of unleaded down.\u201d The latest figures show the price of unleaded at 83.4p in Spain and 93.2p in Ireland at the current exchange rate. Spanish drivers pay just 74.57p for their diesel and Irish motorists 86.05p. Luke Bosdet at the AA said: \u201cThe question for non-supermarket forecourts is whether they ride out the storm or take it on with price cuts of their own. If the latter, the UK could see a serious dent in the average petrol price by the end of the weekend. The wholesale price of petrol over the past three days has recovered a penny and, while nothing is guaranteed with topsy-turvy commodity prices at the moment, drivers ought to enjoy this early Christmas gift while it lasts. \u201cStill, with a saving of \u00a36.50 a tank compared with this time last year, that\u2019s the equivalent of free parking during the Christmas shopping period thanks to the supermarkets.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "You could forgive George Osborne for dreading this latest visit to the UK by Christine Lagarde. Less than three years ago the International Monetary Fund chief dealt what appeared to be a killer blow to the chancellor\u2019s credibility when she told him to rethink his austerity drive. Her chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, went even further and warned Osborne he would be \u201cplaying with fire\u201d if he didn\u2019t let up on cuts. Fast forward to now and, as Osborne said himself, Friday\u2019s assessment from the IMF\u2019s experts \u201ccould hardly be more positive\u201d. The Fund flagged record high employment, a more resilient banking sector and a pace of economic growth that puts many of the UK\u2019s peers in the shade. More importantly, the IMF also gave a ringing endorsement of the government\u2019s deficit-cutting plans. There was not even a hint of the caution shown back in 2013 when the IMF feared that cutting too far and too fast would derail the economy. Now, said Lagarde, the UK stood out as one of the countries that had shaken off the financial crisis. And all that, thanks to \u201cconsiderable effort\u201d on the government\u2019s part. So far so good. But of course the IMF\u2019s job is not just to go round cheerleading governments and growth rates. In the post-crisis era, what matters more is anticipating the risks ahead. Even more important, is coming up with a plan to mitigate those risks. For the UK, there were four key risks, Lagarde said. House prices were rising far faster than incomes and the UK\u2019s trading position was precarious, with a \u201cstrikingly large\u201d current account deficit. The other deficit, on the public finances, was coming down, but the gap between what the government spends and what it takes in was still too high. The fourth risk was whether the UK could really raise its productivity performance in line with other advanced economies. As Osborne noted when he spoke alongside Lagarde, French, German and American workers produce almost a third more per hour than their British counterparts. The sun may be shining for Osborne right now, but none of those four challenges are easy fixes. In fact, all of them are longstanding problems for the UK. Housing supply is chronically low, and changing that will require a skills revolution in the embattled construction sector. Productivity problems are related to that skills shortage. The plans to cut the deficit could derail that punchy economic growth performance Osborne so proudly emphasises. As for the current account deficit, it repeatedly sets new records \u2013 and not in a good way. Then, of course, there is a risk that Lagarde did not put on that list of four but it is clearly close to her heart: Brexit. She stopped short of saying what she or the IMF thought would happen to the economy in the event of the UK voting to leave the EU. She merely cited an apparent conversation between 18th-century philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire. When the former said to the latter \u201cLife is tough\u201d, Voltaire replied curtly: \u201cCompared with what?\u201d But Lagarde is far too astute to miss an opportunity to say what she really thinks. Just as the IMF chief appeared to have answered the last question at her London press briefing and as reporters were closing their notepads, she leaned in closer and said: \u201cBut if I may say on a personal basis \u2026 I am very, very much hopeful that the UK stays within the EU.\u201d Lagarde was happy to back Osborne and the UK economy. But as recent history shows, what a difference a couple of years could make.",

      "bodyText": "Even in a year that will go down in history for the number of huge mergers, the $130bn combination of Dow Chemical and DuPont announced on Friday is a behemoth. The merger would combine two companies that sell pesticides, plant foods and genetically modified crops to millions of farmers around the world, and make a variety of chemicals for consumer and industrial products ranging from electronics, automobiles as well as household goods to building materials and safety equipment. The all-stock merger calls for the two companies to combine as Dow DuPont, then separate into three independent publicly traded companies focused on agriculture, material science and specialty products. The merger brings to a close a record year for deal-making, surpassing a levels unseen since 2007. So Far this year more than $4trn of deals have been struck including the $103bn merger of AB Inbev\u2019s with brewing rival SAB Miller and the $160bn merger of pharmaceutical companies Allergan and Pfizer. The Dow-Dupont deal is a rare combination of equals, rather than a straight purchase \u2013 the stock ratio is calculated so that all shareholders of each component company will come away owning half of the new entity. \u201cOver the last decade our entire industry has experienced tectonic shifts as an evolving world presented complex challenges and opportunities,\u201d said Dow\u2019s chairman and CEO, Andrew Liveris. Liveris will be named executive chairman of the combined company while DuPont\u2019s chairman and CEO, Edward Breen, will be CEO. The company will have dual headquarters in Michigan and Delaware, where the two companies are currently based. Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities called the transaction \u201cthe deal of three centuries\u201d on the companies\u2019 call with investors on Friday morning, saying that he knew the merger had been a long time in the making. \u201cAndrew has coveted this transaction for at least eight years by my clock.\u201d \u201cI have also coveted the transaction,\u201d said Breen. \u201cI was looking at this very seriously as a board member since I joined the board last February.\u201d Breen came to DuPont relatively recently, having been named CEO only last month. In conjunction with the proposed merger, which is subject to regulatory approval, both companies are taking separate restructuring steps. DuPont announced a companywide restructuring plan, including employee and contractor layoffs affecting about 10% of the company\u2019s workforce, to reduce $700m in costs. It expects to record a pretax charge of about $780m, with approximately $650m of employee separation costs and about $130m of asset-related charges and contract terminations. Dow, meanwhile, said it is taking full ownership of Dow Corning, currently a 50-50 joint venture between Dow and Corning. Dow said the move, expected to close in the first half of 2016, is expected to generate more than $1bn in additional adjusted annual earnings and will increase its product offerings in the building and construction, consumer care and automotive markets. The companies said the proposed merger of equals, approved unanimously by their respective directors, will result in cost synergies of about $3bn that are projected to create approximately $30bn of market value. Under the terms of the deal, Dow shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of one share of DowDuPont for each Dow share, and DuPont shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 1.282 shares in DowDuPont for each DuPont share. Dow and DuPont shareholders will own about 50%, respectively, of the combined company. The proposed agriculture business would unite DuPont\u2019s and Dow\u2019s seed and crop protection businesses. The material science company would combine DuPont\u2019s performance materials segment with Dow\u2019s performance plastics, performance materials and chemicals, infrastructure solutions, and consumer solutions units, excluding its electronic materials business. Combined pro forma 2014 revenue for material science was about $51bn. The specialty products company would combine DuPont\u2019s nutrition and health, industrial biosciences, safety and protection, and electronics and communications segments with Dow\u2019s electronic materials business. Combined pro forma 2014 revenue for specialty products was approximately $13bn. The new company\u2019s board is expected to have 16 directors, consisting of eight current DuPont directors and eight current Dow directors.",

Critics said an energy generation auction overseen by the National Grid had descended into a farce by rewarding intensive carbon dioxide (CO2) emitters, just as ministers committed Britain to lower carbon emissions at UN climate change talks in Paris. The Grid confirmed on Friday morning that it had secured the 45 gigawatts (GW) of back-up power generation it wants to meet peak periods of electricity demand starting in 2019. Bidders of gas, nuclear and diesel-fired plants agreed a price of \u00a318 per kilowatt-year (8,760 kilowatt hours), slightly lower than achieved during the first auction last year. The Grid published details on Friday showing energy companies had won contracts to build 650MW of new diesel-driven capacity at a cost of about \u00a3175m. The cost was estimated by Sandbag, an organisation which campaigns to reduce CO2 emissions. \u201cThe UK\u2019s [power auction] is a complete shambles. We\u2019re spending money on all the wrong things and as a result the right things are not happening,\u201d said Bryony Worthington, a Labour life peer and Sandbag founder. \u201cThere should be an urgent investigation into why it\u2019s gone so badly wrong with reforms introduced in the energy bill, which will arrive in the Commons in January.\u201d The Renewable Energy Association, a lobby group, supported the call, saying firms offering storage and other greener technological solutions were losing out. Frank Gordon, senior policy analyst at the REA, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s capacity market auction underlines the problems with the policy \u2013 that it does nothing to support the move away from higher carbon to clean energy, and it does not adequately consider value for money.\u201d Gas-fired power stations won half of the contracts on offer but no energy companies put forward plans to build new gas facilities as the government had hoped. There were also deals for an unspecified number of coal-fired power stations, despite promises from the government that coal would be phased out as too polluting at the start of the next decade. Amber Rudd, the energy secretary, has promised to reform the auction scheme but one of her ministers, Andrea Leadsom, welcomed this year\u2019s awards, arguing they reduced costs for homeowners. \u201cThis result represents a good deal for [energy] customers. Fierce competition in the capacity market has driven down costs, meaning future capacity has been secured at the lowest price possible.\u201d However, Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy secretary, said the government needed to go back to the drawing board. \u201cThis policy has failed in its purpose of attracting investment in new power stations. Instead hundreds of millions of pounds will be paid out to big energy companies to keep open old power stations that would have been open anyway, and to diesel farmers to use ultra-polluting generators, and it is families and businesses who will pick up the tab through their energy bills.\u201d Dustin Benton, head of energy and resources at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: \u201cAmber Rudd deserves praise for deciding to phase out coal, and it\u2019s now clear that she needs to reform our outdated capacity market. \u201cContinuing to give hundreds of millions of pounds to coal is perverse and unnecessary. The UK can keep the lights on without coal if we get rid of the capacity market\u2019s bias against demand response and push ahead with new energy efficiency policy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has lost its second female director in a week, compounding the problems facing chief executive Dave Lewis as he tries to turn around Britain\u2019s biggest retailer. Judith Nelson, the UK and Ireland people director, is to leave the supermarket group after 22 years, Tesco confirmed in a statement on Friday. The announcement follows the shock departure of Jill Easterbrook, who was group transformation director and regarded as a key part of Lewis\u2019s senior team. Tesco shares have fallen to their lowest in 18 years this week as the company battles falling sales and profits ahead of the vital Christmas period. Despite Lewis cutting prices and pledging to improve customer service, Tesco is still losing market share to the discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as underperforming its bitter rival Sainsbury\u2019s. The \u201cbig four\u201d supermarket chains, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons, are under pressure from a shift in shopping habits that has seen households move away from buying groceries in one weekly shop. Instead, consumers are spending on food and drink across a number of formats, including online, convenience stores and the discounters. Tesco shares were down 4.65p, or 3%, to 145.90p in Friday afternoon trading. The share price has fallen 41% since April, when it cleared 250p on hopes that Lewis could turnaround the company quickly. Lewis replaced Philip Clarke as chief executive in September 2014, and within weeks had uncovered an accounting scandal that sparked an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, which remains unresolved. Tesco employs 310,000 people in the UK, meaning Nelson is in charge of the largest private workforce in the country. A Tesco spokesman said: \u201cAfter 22 years at the company, UK and ROI people director Judith Nelson has decided to develop her career outside of Tesco. Judith has been a core member of the team for many years and we\u2019d like to thank her for her valuable contribution. \u201cWe\u2019re excited that business support director Natasha Adams will be taking over from Judith early next year. Natasha joined Tesco in 1998 and has always had a focus on service, with recent roles including UK operations people director and customer service director.\u201d",

The US company will launch 13 eco-friendly vehicles by 2020, meaning that 40% of its models will come in an electric version, up from 13%. Ford\u2019s move comes amid pressure from regulators for carmakers to lower their emissions, the growing threat of technology companies Apple and Google launching a car, and changing attitudes to vehicle ownership as people in cities use car-sharing services, taxis or public transport instead. The pressure on carmakers has been increased by the diesel emissions scandal at Volkswagen, which has revealed that its diesel cars were more polluting than previously thought. The investment in electric vehicles will include hybrid cars that still have a traditional engine, but also pure battery-powered vehicles. Ford will launch a Focus Electric next year that can be charged to 80% in 30 minutes, two hours faster than at present, and run for 100 miles. Raj Nair, chief technical officer at Ford, said: \u201cThe challenge isn\u2019t who provides the most technology in a vehicle but who best organises that technology in a way that most excites and delights people. By observing consumers, we can better understand which features and strengths users truly use and value and create even better experiences for them. \u201cThis new way of working brings together marketing, research, engineering and design in a new way to create meaningful user experiences, rather than individually developing technologies and features that need to be integrated into a final product.\u201d",

The luxury carmaker, owned by the Indian multinational Tata, said the plant would initially produce 150,000 vehicles a year and employ 2,800 people. It is scheduled to open in 2018. The Unite union has previously called for JLR to provide guarantees about the future of its UK workforce and warned that the company\u2019s global expansion should not be at the expense of British workers \u201cwho have built the foundations for that global success\u201d. However, Ralf Speth, chief executive of JLR, moved to quell these fears by claiming the company would remain focused on the UK, where it was rumoured to be considering a deal to buy the Silverstone racing circuit. He said: \u201cThe heart of our company will always be in the UK, where our design, technology and manufacturing capabilities are based. It is our creativity and innovation which makes Jaguar Land Rover the leading boutique automotive brand, offering exceptional products for our customers.\u201d Trade unions reacted warmly to Speth\u2019s comments and said the internal expansion of JLR should ultimately lead to more investment in the UK. Roger Maddison, Unite\u2019s chief negotiator with the motor industry, said: \u201cThis is great news and shows how successful the UK workforce has made JLR over the past few years, to allow it to grow across the world. \u201cUnless we grow, we won\u2019t be as successful as the BMWs and Mercedes of this world. It is good news for the company and allows them to make more money to invest in the UK.\u201d JLR employs 36,000 people worldwide, the vast majority of whom are in the UK. It has factories in Halewood near Liverpool, and in the West Midlands at Castle Bromwich, Solihull \u2013 where production of the Land Rover Defender is about to end after nearly 70 years \u2013 and Wolverhampton, where it has an engine manufacturing centre that JLR has committed to double in size. The company has overseas facilities in India, China and Brazil. However, the company has launched a review of its costs that could lead to \u00a34.5bn of spending being cut. JLR\u2019s profits have fallen owing to declining demand in China. Speth added: \u201cJaguar Land Rover is delighted today to welcome Slovakia into our family. The new factory will complement our existing facilities in the UK, China, India and Brazil and marks the next step in the company\u2019s strategy to become a truly global business.\u201d Slovakia is believed to have offered JLR \u20ac130m (\u00a394m) of aid to support construction of the factory. It trumped rival bids from eastern Europe and Mexico to build it. Robert Fico, prime minister of Slovakia, said: \u201cWe are glad that Jaguar Land Rover has chosen Slovakia for its new world-class manufacturing facility. This decision shows that, with a stable and solid business environment, Slovakia is an attractive place for investors, and the marriage of Slovak craftsmanship and British engineering holds great promise.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "International Personal Finance has lost around a fifth of its value after the emerging markets lender revealed an unexpected change in consumer legislation in Slovakia, a move which could hit its business in the country. Almost two years after Poland gave the company an unwanted Christmas gift in the form of a \u00a32.4m fine and around three months since Poland placed a cap on all non-interest costs of credit, Slovakia also plans changes to loan legislation. The proposals - which had not previously been discussed - were revealed just before the market closed on Thursday, following a vote in the Slovak parliament. IPF\u2019s shares are currently down 21% or 68.8p to 253.7p, having fallen as low as 230p earlier. The company said a 27% cap on remuneration would apply to all costs associated with a loan, whether mandatory or not. IPF said: Based on our current understanding these changes would mean that all fees that IPF raises in connection with the issuance of a loan, including the fee for home service, would need to be levied at rates consistent with the remuneration cap. The draft law will go before the president for approval, and if he vetos it it will go back to parliament early next year. If it is approved again there will apparently be no opportunity for a second veto. IPF said: [If approved] it would have a material adverse financial impactd on [the] Slovak business and the company is very actively reviewing the implications of these unexpected amendments. In the 12 months to June, the Slovak business generated \u00a343m of revenues and \u00a36m of pretax profit. Analysts at Liberum said: [These amendments] came as a surprise to us and the company. The statement went on to say that if the legislation was enacted in current form it would, \u201cHave a material adverse financial impact on its Slovak business.\u201d The legislation may well be challenged before becoming effective. We leave forecasts unchanged, for now. Our analysis suggests a hit to 2016 earnings per share of 11% to 19%. We increase our discount to the sector to 45% (old: 40%), giving a target price of 262p, 2016 PE of 9.5 times (worst case scenario). At Numis, analyst James Hamilton said: Slovakia announced a very different and materially worse interest rate cap than Poland and it looks to us that this market will now be uneconomic. It appears to us that it will (assuming the regulation is passed) be impossible for a significant proportion of the population to be able to get any form credit at all. This is however, not material in a P&amp;L context but given the market concerns about regulation, we expect the share price impact to be more significant than the 5% decline seen yesterday. The bears will argue that IPF is being regulated out of existence, but we suspect this is not the case and eventually Slovakia and Poland will repeal their regulation as illegal lending (with all its associated consequences) expands to fill the space left by legitimate providers of credit. Nevertheless, given where the valuation is, we do not see where valuation support is for the group given the annual cash return to shareholders is now in excess of 11%, with a PE of 8.7 times, and a 20% earnings per share compound annual growth rate since IPF came to market. Consequently, we have no idea where the shares bottom. We expect to reduce our forecasts to reflect the \u00a36m profit contribution of Slovakia. IPF are not aware of any other country that is considering similar regulation.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares have headed lower for the seventh trading day, as concerns about the mining sector continue and investors nervously await a likely US rate rise next week. Shares in companies with South African connections were among the leading losers, as the rand continued to weaken after President Jacob Zuma sacked finance minister Nhlanhia Nene on Wednesday. Investment group Old Mutual is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 14.6p at 159.6p, while packaging and paper group Mondi has lost 28p to \u00a312.88. Among the mid-caps Investec is down nearly 7% or 31.9p to 438p. The uncertainty in South Africa is not helping local mining companies, at a time when the whole sector is under pressure. With iron ore still weakening on worries about slowing demand, especially from China, mining shares are falling again. Anglo American is down 7.9p at 310.75p after this week\u2019s badly received update, including the company halting dividend payments. Analysts are concerned this could set a precedent for other mining companies. Late on Thursday Moody\u2019s cut its rating on Anglo from Baa2 to Baa3, and placed the company on review for further downgrades. BHP Billiton is down 16.1p at 717.1p while Rio Tinto has lost 13.5p to 1957.5p. Oil is also on the slide again on oversupply concerns, with Brent crude down 0.6% at $39.49. So Royal Dutch Shell B shares have fallen 29.5p to \u00a315.04 but British Airways owner International Airlines Group is up 3.5p at 576.5p on the prospect of cheaper fuel costs. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 23.79 points at 6064.16, ahead of Chinese retail sales and industrial production data due to be released over the weekend. Elsewhere, housebuilder Bellway is topping the FTSE 250 index, up 119p at \u00a326.88 after a positive trading update. It said its financial year had started well supported by strong market conditions and it expected to build around 10% more houses during the year. Peel Hunt analyst Gavin Jago said: Bellway has seen continued strong demand, pricing ahead of expectations and an easing in volatility in labour availability. Price and volume growth are now both expected to be around 10% for the current year. We have increased our pretax profit forecasts by around 5% and nudged our target price up to 2,890p. After this morning\u2019s share price rise, we maintain our hold recommendation.",

      "bodyText": "That great steel and aluminium beast, the Land Rover Defender, and its ancestors have been clanging and clunking their way off the production line at Solihull since 1948. Born in postwar rationing, the Defender feels as quintessentially British as the Queen, Churchill or Bond, among the other national icons who have been plonked atop its unbending chassis. Orders have boomed of late, and the 2 millionth Defender will be auctioned off at Bonhams in London next week, probably for the price of a luxury sports car. But the model that has served adventurers, soldiers, farmers and generations of enthusiasts is almost done: overtaken at last by time, technology and legislation. The cold truth of the business is that the manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover, is now owned by Indian multinational Tata, and the world has moved on. In early 2016, production of the Defender will cease at its West Midlands home. Eric Davis worked on the original production line of what was then the Land Rover Series I. Now aged 90, he has returned for a visit and looks on intently as his modern successor attaches the bolts to a panel of a Defender. Davis, who had spent three years in service in Burma during and after the second world war, landed a job as a wing fitter at the factory through his brother, who had joined from making Spitfires nearby. \u201cit\u2019s much easier now,\u201d he laughs, \u201cit used to be all.\u201d He mimics the rapid arm movements of someone tightening bolts with a spanner. Now, there\u2019s a pneumatic fastener. Land Rovers have been built there ever since: the operation has evolved and expanded, but the Defender (as it was rebranded in 1990) is, if not exactly hand-crafted, made with a far bigger human input than found in most modern car production lines. In places, robots swing door panels around to spot-weld with pinpoint accuracy; but a few metres away, a section of the factory still runs as it did 67 years ago, Davis confirms. \u201cBuilding the face of one of the world\u2019s most iconic vehicles - this production line has never changed,\u201d says Michael Bishop, a Land Rover historian who leads tours of the line. He holds up a metal part that has been in every vehicle from one to 2m, a \u201cstiffener top\u201d for the rear wheel well. The engines, gearboxes and even the doors now have a complexity that sees them constructed elsewhere, but the transformation on this line of the dull sheen of aluminium parts into a moving vehicle at the other end is still something to behold. Not bad for what Bishop characterises as a giant meccano set. After the body is assembled, it takes a day to treat with 185C baths and electrolysis in the paint shop, before the fitted-out Defender emerges on day three, in a succession of four-minute stages along the assembly line where around 500 people work. Every vehicle is built to order, from a vast array of permutations of bodies and bases. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find two the same, even normally. And all these are limited editions,\u201d says John Carroll, the editor of Classic Land Rover, at the Solihull line. The vehicles made during a ramped-up final year of production in Solihull include tributes to the HUE 166, the original Series I model whose Birmingham area number plate devotees all recognise, with Defenders painted in that original shade of RAF surplus green. Its conception owed much to the war: the Rover firm had grown from a Victorian sewing machine manufacturer via bicycles to carmaking, and moved to Solihull \u2013 a camouflaged site built to manufacture aeroplanes in the war \u2013 in 1945 after its Coventry home was bombed. Rover\u2019s chief engineer, Maurice Wilks, had been running a Jeep \u2013 the US army\u2019s second world war workhorse \u2013 on his farm at Anglesey and was inspired to go one step beyond, famously sketching out the design for his new vehicle on the island\u2019s sands. With a four-wheel drive, a light aluminium body, bench seats and canvas roofs, the Land Rover was said to be like a Jeep but better. To mark the first year of production, children of staff were invited to the Solihull factory celebrations, which included demonstrations of the new Land Rover driving at a 30 degree sideways tilt on the test track. As the adults climbed aboard, Rover spotted a winner: the adventurous test drive became a marketing device that persists to this day. An exhibition in the heart of the Defender production line compiles a small history of owners\u2019 and enthusiasts\u2019 testimonies, from the vehicles used in pioneering Royal Geographical Expeditions, a battered Series I handed down from first owner to granddaughter, and more than one Land Rover used as couples\u2019 official wedding cars. The manufacturer estimates that 66% of all those ever built are still on the road. So given the longevity and the passion it inspires, what has sealed its demise? Partly, changes in legislation that made some of its distinctive features outmoded, if not downright illegal. Side-facing seats in the back were outlawed by EU legislation after 2007, and changing standards, in fuel consumption and emissions to crash tests, made more and more facets of the Defender unviable. Once no longer compliant for sale in the US, the Defender\u2019s prospects in other markets were severely curtailed. The harsher truth is that even its admirers have started to turn away, no longer as forgiving of its faults. The reviews are telling: while the readers of What Car? still proclaim their passion for the Defenders they own, the professionals have had enough: a one-star verdict, \u201cwoeful\u201d on safety, \u201cloud\u201d and \u201ca horrible ride\u201d. It sums up: \u201cOff-road, very little can touch it. On-road, there\u2019s very little to recommend it.\u201d While the nostalgia-fest has stoked strong sales throughout the last year of production, the manufacturers clearly had to act. A Jaguar Land Rover spokeswoman says: \u201cAs loved and iconic as it was, it needs a full overhaul. As a business model it needs to advance. But the story of Defender will continue.\u201d A next generation model of the Defender is expected to be unveiled in the next two years \u2013 one whose stature is more akin to the modern 4x4s on the road. Marketing departments of the future may be keen to stress its heritage to certain buyers, likely the Brits. But Land Rover concedes that the clear lineage of the current Defender from the Series I of a very different postwar Britain will be gone. And whatever its future shape, no one will claim it to be handmade in Britain. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 December 2015. An earlier version gave the year 1983 where 1990 was meant.",

      "bodyText": "The cost of business interruption is on the rise with the average cost of claims between 2010 and 2014 exceeding \u20ac1m, according to a report. Research by Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty states that the increase is due to the ever greater interconnectivity of the global economy. A fire or a flood in a factory in one region, for example, causes a knock-on business interruption elsewhere, not just for the company itself but also for other businesses unable to operate because of the effect on a supplier. Analysis of a sample of more than 1,658 business interruption claims with a value of more than \u20ac20,000 found that the top cause worldwide was fire and explosion, accounting for almost 60% of such claims by value. However, the research found the cause of claims varied depending on location. In Asia,storm and flood-related losses were more likely to cause business interruption than fire or explosions which, according to the report, reflects \u201cthe region\u2019s continuing economic development increasing exposure to natural hazards\u201d. The top cause of business interruption in Asia in the 2010-14 period was strike action. Storms caused the most disruption to business in the Caribbean, accounting for a third of claims by value. The type of claims also differ depending on the line of the business. In the energy sector, fire and explosion was the top cause of business interruption, by both the number of claims (42%) and value (71%). These claims were also the top causes of business interruption in the property and mid-corporate sectors. In the entertainment industry, the biggest interruptions were caused by cast members being unable to perform. Fire and explosion accounted for just 4% of the total number of claims and 5% of claims by value. The report also examined 12 \u201cvery large events\u201d that resulted in 149 claims, the total value of which ran to \u20ac1.34bn. The report pointed to the potential knock-on effect of such events, such as the 2011 Japanese earthquake. The disaster triggered losses among European and US businesses which required vital components manufactured by Japanese suppliers, resulting in about 150 claim notifications to Allianz, mostly from companies based outside Japan. Methodology: Allianz analysed 1,807 business interruption insurance claims valued at \u20ac20,000 in 68 countries between 2010-2014. These consisted of 1,658 \u201cbase claims\u201d and 149 \u201cvery large events\u201d. Claims figures include AGCS and co-insurers shares. The losses analysed are not representative of the industry as a whole; however, the report states that they give a strong indication of the major business interruption risks that dominate industrial insurance.",

      "bodyText": "Is there any better example of the decrepit state of business leadership in this country than the response of the Business Council of Australia to the government\u2019s innovation policy? Appearing at the AFR\u2019s workplace and productivity summit, the head of the BCA, Catherine Livingstone, responded to the $1.1bn innovation statement by arguing for greater labour market flexibility, saying \u201cwe have to be able to talk about whether the current workplace relations system in Australia is able to accommodate the changes we are talking about\u201d. Of course she did. The BCA responds to every issue by suggesting more labour flexibility is the answer. Were someone from the BCA to be a judge on The Great Australian Bake Off, they would suggest the sponge cake was beautifully baked, the icing elegantly done, but it really lacked a dollop of labour force flexibility to bring out the taste. But rather than suggesting it is about charging lower wages for workers or being able to fire workers with greater ease, those who favour greater labour market flexibility often couch it in terms of being for the benefit of workers, especially youth workers. The productivity commission\u2019s draft report on workplace relations, after admitting there was no real evidence of a link between labour market flexibility and improved productivity, noted \u201cthere are some potentially concerning trends. In particular, youth unemployment is rising, and by more than the growth in the unemployment rates of prime-aged people in the labour market\u201d. Back in June, Catherine Livingstone also asserted that youth unemployment was at a \u201ccrisis\u201d. Yes, the call for labour market flexibility is really just Helen Lovejoy asking \u201cwon\u2019t somebody think of the children?\u201d But the odd thing is, youth employment is now actually doing quite well \u2013 for the past nine months it\u2019s been growing faster than the employment of prime-aged workers: This week at the workplace and productivity summit, Andrew Charlton, the director of AlphaBeta Economics, also asserted that youth unemployment was \u201calready at 12% \u2013 twice the rate of the rest of the Australian population\u201d and that somehow this was costing $13bn in lost GDP. But there is absolutely nothing unusual about the current youth unemployment rate \u2013 it is always about twice that of the total. Young people are always the first to be sacked when economic times get tough, and are usually the last to be hired when things start improving. There\u2019s not a lot we can do about this fact, because young workers are never, on average, going to be more valuable to an employer than someone who has say 10-15 years of experience. You can improve the training and skills of youth to help them be better prepared for work, but, as they say, you can\u2019t teach experience. What we need to beware is if youth unemployment becomes higher than you would expect it to be given overall unemployment. In the labour force figures released on Thursday, the unemployment rate of prime-age workers \u2013 aged 25-64 \u2013 was 4.83%. Over the past 20 years, given such a rate, you would expect youth unemployment to be around 12.6% ... which is exactly where it is. Or, to put it another way, over the past decade \u2013 a period which includes the mining boom and the GFC \u2013 the youth unemployment rate has on average been 2.83 times that of the unemployment rate of 25-64 year olds. But right now, the youth rate is just 2.6 times the prime-age rate: That is, given recent history, the youth unemployment rate is actually lower than we otherwise would expect. Hardly something that cries out for labour market reform. And the link between youth and overall unemployment in Australia is nothing out of the ordinary. From 2000 to 2014, the average across the OECD was for the youth unemployment rate to be 1.98 times that of the unemployment rate of 15 to 64-year-olds. Australia in that time averaged a ratio of 2.07 \u2013 lower than the UK and New Zealand, and even with the USA: And you would be hard pressed to suggest greater labour market flexibility would do anything. Germany, Israel, Denmark and Japan, which have the lowest ratio of youth to total unemployment, are also ranked among the highest in various categories of labour market regulations: Now that doesn\u2019t mean all is fine and dandy with youth employment, but suggesting a lack of flexibility is the cause of any concerns (especially given Australia\u2019s labour market is already one of the most flexible in the OECD) is a tough ask. One of the complaints about the Fair Work Act was that the new regulations would make it harder to employ youth on a part-time or casual basis. But a look at the data shows youth part-time employment has been growing strongly, and kept going even while overall employment growth was weak: Youth full-time employment has been struggling a bit, but even here, the growth largely follows that of prime-aged full-time employment. Historically, youth full-time employment growth is only ever stronger than that of prime-aged workers when the economy is really growing fast \u2013 as occurred during the mining boom years of 2003-08: Certainly the percentage of youth in employment has fallen since the GFC, but a big reason for that is an increase in the numbers of youth choosing to stay in education. And while being in education may not be an economic cure-all, the percentage of 20 to 24-year-olds who are unemployed but not in full-time education often matches the total unemployment rate \u2013 as indeed it does right now: Youth unemployment should always be a concern. It is often the canary in the mine \u2013 when it starts rising it\u2019s often an indicator that things are about to turn ugly. But it shouldn\u2019t be used as reason to change industrial relations laws \u2013 especially when Australia\u2019s youth unemployment is in no way out of step with other advance economies; is where you would expect it to be given overall unemployment; and there is nothing to suggest the current youth unemployment rate has anything to do with a lack of flexibility in the labour market.",

      "bodyText": "The use of bank cards to pay for a round of drinks at the bar has increased fivefold over the past decade, according to a report. The UK Cards Association, which represents Britain\u2019s major bank card providers, said spending on plastic by British shoppers more than doubled between 2005 and 2014 to \u00a3566bn \u2013 more than the entire Dutch economy last year. Card spending overtook cash spending in 2004, according to the association, and accounts for more than three-quarters of all UK spending. But its figures show how our spending patterns have changed in the decade since then. Pubs appear to have seen one of the most dramatic shifts to plastic. Card spending in pubs reached almost \u00a35bn last year, compared with \u00a31bn in 2005. Richard Koch, head of policy at the UK Cards Association, noted that while supermarket spending on bank cards doubled in the decade up to 2014 \u2013 reaching \u00a399.5bn \u2013 the amount spent during each visit had fallen. The average supermarket bill dropped from \u00a331 in 2009 to \u00a325 five years later, as consumers abandoned the big weekly shop for more frequent visits to a range of shops. Record shops saw the biggest fall in card spending, down 71% during an era when many independent record stores and big chains alike have disappeared from high streets. However, vinyl sales have been staging a comeback to the extent that Tesco has begun stocking LPs for the first time as sales are expected to reach a 20-year high. Smaller shops that once only took cash have installed card readers and experienced a big leap in card spending over the decade. The amount spent on cards at bakers rose from \u00a33m in 2005 to \u00a328m last year. Other small shops to experience a significant increase include pawn shops and even sweetshops, with card transactions at the latter up more than 150% since 2005. The rise of contactless payments, which since September have allowed shoppers to buy goods up to \u00a330 without using their pin, was also a factor in increased card use. The figures showed \u00a32.6bn was spent on contactless in the first six months of 2015. \u201cToday we think nothing of paying for a coffee and a sandwich with a contactless payment card or streaming films on a smartphone which is also enabled for mobile payments,\u201d Koch said. \u201cThis is so different to a decade ago when we carried more cash and shopped in high street stores. Even during the last recession, the use of cards as a proportion of overall spending continued to grow as customers recognised the convenience, ease and security of this method of payment.\u201d The decision by many big retailers, particularly the supermarkets, to stop accepting cheques was seen as one of the main reasons that the share of payment card spending within the food and drink sector increased significantly over this period. The Cards Association also said consumers had increasingly opted to use a debit rather than credit card over the decade, possibly reflecting a more cautious attitude to spending following the 2008 financial crisis. Debit cards accounted for just over half of all card transactions in 2005; a decade later that figure had risen to 71%. While GDP fell in 2008 and 2009, spending on cards increased, by 7% and 5% respectively, as more people used cards as their main method of payment. UK Card Payments said there were 1.3bn online transactions in 2014, worth a total of \u00a3119bn. Entertainment websites accounted for a quarter of online transactions in 2014, the equivalent of 8% of all spending online. Koch said the increased use of online payments by government agency websites such as DVLA had played its part. About 48.5 million people held a debit card in 2014, up from 40.8 million 10 years earlier. In contrast, the number of credit card holders was broadly unchanged over this period at about 31 million.",
