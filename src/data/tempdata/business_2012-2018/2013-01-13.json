The transaction was expected to guarantee the continuation of Airbus production work in Britain, which was a key reason for David Cameron's enthusiastic support for the deal. The UK accounts for about 15% of Airbus production, with the remainder carried out in France, Germany and Spain \u2013 countries that are also shareholders in EADS and control nearly 50% of the company.

      "bodyText": "It's bonus time in the City. By the end of this week, some of the biggest names in the financial world \u2013 the likes of Goldman Sachs and Citigroup \u2013 will have published their 2012 results and begun to tell their staff how big their payouts will be. The controversy has already started with Goldman considering ways to defer bonuses from previous years to pay out in April, after the top rate of income tax has been cut to 45%. A year ago, Goldman set aside \u00a38bn to pay its staff \u2013 an average of \u00a3238,000 each \u2013 a figure it is expected to beat this year. That average hides the fact some of the bigger hitters will have taken home millions. The bonus season will help decide how many boats are sold at this week's London Boat Show, luxury homes bought and fine wines glugged. It is a moment to feel envy or anger that bankers are being rewarded at a time when their industry is at a low ebb in the wake of scandals over Libor-rigging, busting US sanctions and laundering money for drug barons, and when Britain seems to be heading for a triple-dip recession. To the 800 staff sacked at Honda's car factory in Swindon last week, or workers at retailer Jessops, which closed its doors on Friday, a bonus would be still having a job. There are those in the City who argue that payouts for 2012 are going to be a fraction of those in the past \u2013 although the big US-based banks are expected to defy the trend. While profits are up in many instances, pressure from regulators and shareholders to rein in pay is stronger than ever and some believe this will show up in bonus deals this year, but most clearly at the European banks. \"The US banks are under far less regulatory pressure. But it is totally different in Europe, with bonuses down 50% or more,\" said Lee Thacker, a partner at City headhunters Silvermine Partners. Europe-based banks tend to publish their results and bonuses for staff a few weeks later than their US rivals. The bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, always a political firestorm, is not expected to make decisions about its investment bankers' bonus pot, which stood at \u00a3390m a year ago, until its fine for Libor rigging has been settled. The bank is in the last throes of negotiation with regulators, who are expected to hit the 83% taxpayer-owned bank with a fine bigger than the \u00a3290m paid by Barclays last year. Stephen Hester, the RBS boss who a year ago admitted he nearly quit amid the row over his bonus, has already waived any payment after the bank's IT meltdown in the summer. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, his counterpart at Lloyds (39%-owned by the taxpayer) could be in line for at least \u00a32m, however. Barclays, under the leadership of its new \u00a38m-a-year chief executive, Antony Jenkins, will need to ensure its Libor fine knocks millions off its bonus pool and shows shareholders that in the post Bob Diamond era, pay at the bank will be a less explosive issue. HSBC and Standard Chartered, two UK-based banks who often manage to avoid the bonus spotlight, will also feel the heat after paying out millions to US regulators for breaches of the rules. Early indications are that the top-end estate agents are not expecting a big bonus boost this year. Nick Barnes, head of research at upmarket estate agents Chesterton Humberts, said very little bonus money was being pumped into property. \"Before the recession, there were people coming in and buying a small flat \u2013 say for half a million \u2013 with cash or a sizable deposit,\" he said. It is a view echoed by David Adams, managing director of John Taylor, which sells properties above \u00a31m. Bankers first begin making inquiries with Adams every November when employers begin to set their employees' expectations for the year. \"We no longer have bankers knocking down our doors to spend \u00a310m, \u00a312m on trophy houses,\" he said. As enormous as the sum might still seem, these days bankers are more willing to spend just under \u00a32m \u2013 which Adams reckons is enough for a two-bedroom residence in London's upmarket Kensington \u2013 and crucially below the price at which the top rate stamp duty of 7% kicks in. Even if banks show what they believe to be restraint, it may still not to be enough to quell public anger. A spokesman for the Robin Hood tax campaign, which wants to see a tax on the financial sector, said: \"Bonuses have been slightly down on previous years, but they are still massive in terms of what ordinary people view as fair rewards. Ordinary people don't see why people \u2013 especially when they are working at loss-making organisations \u2013 should be raking in millions.\"",

      "bodyText": "A lot of water has passed under the bridge since Britain hosted the G8 summit at Gleneagles in July 2005. Life was sweet when the leaders of the world's most powerful western economies pledged themselves to debt relief and aid to help poor countries. Growth was strong, asset prices were rising, and the financial crisis was two years away. In 2013 it will, once again, be Britain's turn to chair the G8, but the mood will be quite different when leaders meet at Lough Erne in Northern Ireland this summer. The talk will be of fiscal cliffs, the euro's struggle for survival, high energy prices and the struggle to ensure financial solvency. One thing is certain: there will be no repeat of the commitment to double aid within five years. Money is tight. Back in 2005, the pressure on Tony Blair came from only one source: the Make Poverty History (MPH) coalition that saw Gleneagles as an opportunity to cajole the G8 into making binding pledges on development. David Cameron has a more difficult task this year \u2013 for in addition to the lobbying by MPH2, he is coming under fire from aid sceptics who challenge the logic of a government that is cutting public spending at home massively increasing public spending abroad. The thrust of the argument from the anti-aid lobby is as follows: aid does not work because it traps countries in a culture of dependency. Much of it is either wasted or siphoned off by corrupt regimes, so the taxes of poor people in rich countries ends up bankrolling the lavish lifestyles of rich people in poor countries. In Britain, lobbying by powerful and arrogant charities has led to an increase in the aid budget so big that the Department for International Development (DfID) does not know what to do with its embarrassment of riches. Aid has become a gigantic racket and should be pared back to genuine humanitarian relief. That will leave space for the private sector to power development, the only sure way for countries to escape poverty. The anti-aid lobby is livid that Cameron, the chancellor, George Osborne, and the development secretary, Justine Greening, are making good on the promise made by the last Labour government to raise the aid budget to 0.7% of national income in 2013. Given the precarious state of the UK's public finances, the assumption was that the prime minister and his cabinet colleagues would eventually renege on the pledge. They deserve credit for not doing so. Here's why. Firstly, the anti-aid brigade mounts what is largely a straw man argument. Nobody at DfID, Oxfam, the World Bank or any other body involved in development would ever say that aid alone is the answer to tackling poverty. It has always been seen as part of the solution, along with the right macroeconomic policies, private sector investment, boosting trade and, in Africa, encouraging regional integration. Secondly, both sides of the aid debate would agree on the need to tackle waste and corruption. Conservative ministers here have been acutely aware of the need to maintain public support for a rising aid budget during a period of austerity, which was why Greening's predecessor, Andrew Mitchell, undertook reviews of bilateral and multilateral spending and insisted on better value for money. Whereas Labour favoured general budget support for poor countries \u2013 giving governments more control over their own spending \u2013 the coalition has preferred to finance specific projects. Greening has insisted that a minister must sign off spending on any development project costing more than \u00a35m rather than the previous limit of \u00a340m. She has announced the end of UK aid to India; stopped money for Rwanda amid evidence that it has been used to finance rebel forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and has suspended all direct aid to Uganda after reports of misuse. This would appear to be the zero-tolerance approach the aid sceptics are urging. Certainly, it is hardly consistent with the lurid stories of DfID sitting idly by while taxpayers' money is being siphoned off into numerous Swiss bank accounts. However, corruption is not going to be tackled simply by turning off the flow of official western assistance. It will also require action against tax havens, against the arms trade and against multinational companies guilty of bribery. The aid sceptics tend to be far less vociferous about these issues. Thirdly, there is plenty of evidence to show aid is working. The charity One has compiled a list of 14 African countries \u2013 including Ethiopia, Tanzania, Malawi and Senegal \u2013 that shared some characteristics in the period after 2000: they qualified for debt relief; they weren't dependent on extractive industries; they were not embroiled in civil conflict. On average, in these countries aid flows increased threefold between 2000 and 2010, but there was no sign that official assistance crowded out private investment. Far from it, foreign direct investment increased fourfold over the same period. Growth averaged 5.5% between 2000 and 2011, an impressive performance given the meltdown in the global economy that followed the financial crisis of 2007. In 2002, there were 300,000 people receiving HIV/Aids medicine; today the number exceeds 8 million. As a result of international aid efforts, the number of Africans with access to a bed net has increased from 3% to 50% in a decade. Spending on vaccines, bed nets and nutrition has meant child mortality in sub-Saharan countries has dropped by 41%. Education is seen \u2013 rightly \u2013 as the key to competing in the global economy, and over the past decade 51 million more children are in primary school because of the resources provided by debt relief and aid. DfID funds a scheme in Sierra Leone called Making it Happen, where skilled health workers from Britain share their expertise with doctors, nurses and midwives in an attempt reduce high levels of infant and child mortality. Far from creating a dependency culture, this is an example of \"smart aid\": the provision of know-how and best practice that will help Sierra Leone help itself. There are similar UK government initiatives to sponsor technology transfer and to boost private sector investment in infrastructure. All these seem worthy uses of the 70p in every \u00a3100 of national income that the government allocates to help countries far less fortunate than our own. It is certainly strange that the government is making life more difficult for poor people in the UK at the same time it is trying to improve the lot of even poorer people in the rest of the world. The disparity between welfare policy at home and welfare policy abroad has certainly made the attacks of the anti-aid lobby more politically potent. But it is not coalition policy towards countries facing what Jamie Drummond co-founder of One, calls the three extremes \u2013 extreme poverty, extreme climate change and extremist ideology \u2013 that is incomprehensible. It is the rest of it.",

None are yet expressing concern about their investment, but the Americans are evidently spooked by the prospect of losing billions in exports to rival Airbus \u2013 whose giant A380s last year suffered their own teething problems.</p> <p>The stakes are now so high that Washington is getting involved. The sight of US transportation secretary Ray LaHood standing alongside Boeing's boss to assure the world that he would have \"no reservation in boarding these planes <em>and</em> taking a flight\" indicates how serious the issue is for the US economy. That's the kind of courageous PR stand not seen since John Selwyn Gummer took a bite out of a beefburger at the height of the BSE crisis. Although let's hope it proves a little more effective.</p>",

Over time, the ONS clearly hopes the RPI will wither away, but without the row that would have ensued if it had taken a bolder approach and simply changed how the index is calculated. However, the thicket of inflation measures, which are to be updated on Tuesday, all tell the same dismal story. After sliding since mid-2011, inflation is on the rise, helped by sharp increases in domestic energy prices. With little sign of a recovery in workers' bargaining power, wages are unlikely to follow suit. So the squeeze on living standards that has been exerting pressure since the crisis took hold will continue, meaning less money for consumers to spend and weaker demand. Whatever you call it, inflation is starting to look like a major barrier to recovery. Boeing needs the world to buy its American dream Once, ships made of iron could only appear destined to sink. Today, aviation is pinning its hopes of a greener, more peaceful future on an aircraft made of plastic. So little wonder that the spectacle of five safety incidents in a week \u2013 however minor \u2013 could trigger rumblings of distrust from a nervous public. Yet airlines the world over have lined up to buy Boeing's wonder craft, the 787 Dreamliner, with an eager eye on the dramatic promised fuel savings. None are yet expressing concern about their investment, but the Americans are evidently spooked by the prospect of losing billions in exports to rival Airbus \u2013 whose giant A380s last year suffered their own teething problems. The stakes are now so high that Washington is getting involved. The sight of US transportation secretary Ray LaHood standing alongside Boeing's boss to assure the world that he would have \"no reservation in boarding these planes and taking a flight\" indicates how serious the issue is for the US economy. That's the kind of courageous PR stand not seen since John Selwyn Gummer took a bite out of a beefburger at the height of the BSE crisis. Although let's hope it proves a little more effective.",

      "bodyText": "They say 13 is lucky for some. After a miserable Christmas, Marc Bolland, the embattled chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, will need more than luck to get through 2013 with his job intact. The Dutchman's fate is likely to rest on his performance over the next 12 months when he must bounce back from a miserable Christmas in clothing while trying to drag the UK's favourite knicker seller into the 21st century. Things did not get off to a good start last week when leaked news of M&amp;S's poor festive clothing sales forced him to rush out a financial statement late on Wednesday evening. The incident added fuel to rumours that Bolland is facing rebels within his own head office, as well as issues with knitwear and pants. A string of management changes and restructurings appear to indicate an unhappy ship, with rumours that Bolland tends to micromanage his staff. What's more, the 128-year-old retailer posted an unexpectedly bad 3.8% fall in underlying sales of clothing and homewares, the main factor in a 1.8% fall in overall underlying sales for the group in the three months to 29 December. After M&amp;S's turkey of a Christmas, some onlookers are already convinced that Bolland's goose is cooked. Profits are going backwards despite heavy spending on store refits, IT and new warehouses. Beyond the hysteria, however, M&amp;S's share price barely shifted. Food held up, delivering a 0.3% rise in underlying sales over the period, despite the UK's economic woes. Bolland fended off a profits warning through cost-cutting, a better-than-expected performance on food, and improved profit margins on clothing, secured by reduced discounts. His strategy and team are understood to retain the full backing of the group's board, and leading shareholders also appear prepared to give Bolland more time. The problems with M&amp;S's core women's clothing ranges were already well recognised before Christmas. A new clothing team led by M&amp;S lifer John Dixon, fresh from bringing about a revival in the store's food business, and Belinda Earl, former boss of Debenhams and Jaeger, was appointed in July. Their influence will not be fully apparent until autumn, when the future of Bolland and the business itself is likely to be decided. Their challenge is clear on any store visit. M&amp;S has the difficult job of catering to a very wide audience. Its large, ungainly stores were mostly acquired well before the internet was even imagined and its vast array of products can be confusing to navigate. Modern shoppers cannot be bothered to wade through this jungle, analysts think. They want to be able to spot ranges chosen specifically for them and presented in a way that helps them put items together. M&amp;S has created in-house brands such as Per Una, Limited Collection and Autograph to help with that job. But fashion experts say the problem is more that these brands don't have a clear identity. Their look and target audience appears to change by the year, the season or the whim of the latest buyer in charge. \"With a wide range of customers it is really important to get individual branded areas and their presentation right so the customer knows what to look for,\" says Lorna Hall of fashion trends consultancy WGSN. M&amp;S is also one of the few remaining retailers to present its clothes in categories \u2013 collecting knitwear, trousers or dresses together, creating a scary sea of products. Breaking that old-fashioned arrangement is not simple. It would involve expensive investment to rearrange stores and mean changes in the way products are bought, managed and promoted. Meanwhile, shoppers complain that the delicate balance of quality, price and fashionability has got out of sync. Jane Kellock, of the fashion blog for fortysomethings The Women's Room, says her peers still love M&amp;S, but want it to stop chasing trends and drop gimmicky details. \"We want well-made clothes that take current trends into account, but only if they are relevant to our age group,\" she writes on the blog. That can only be delivered by tectonic shifts in the way M&amp;S finds and handles its merchandise. \"M&amp;S's biggest single problem is its supply chain,\" says Credit Suisse retail analyst Simon Irwin. \"It's not going to be fully modernised until 2016.\" This spring M&amp;S will open a 1m sq ft fully-automated distribution centre in Castle Donington, Leicestershire, that will support its e-commerce operation. It's part of a multimillion-pound plan to reduce the 70-odd inefficient warehouses which handle M&amp;S non-food goods to just four giant centres. The first of those opened in Bradford, west Yorkshire in 2010 and the remaining two are likely to take up to four years to come on stream. These big logistical moves are often risky. Glitches at a swanky new automated warehouse nearly brought Sainsbury's to its knees in 2004. But without a new logistical system, backed by more up-to-date IT which is also in train, M&amp;S will only fall further behind more efficient rivals such as Next. Its ageing system not only adds to costs but also slows up its processes, so that M&amp;S refreshes its stock less often than rivals. Even premium brands such as Autograph see new products only every three or four weeks. Outdated systems and practices were no doubt also behind M&amp;S's failure to buy enough of its bestsellers in the summer. Also on the agenda in 2013 is a much needed revamp of M&amp;S's website. At present shoppers must wrestle with a platform M&amp;S inherited from Amazon, the US online giant. It's clunky to operate, boring and not very helpful in cutting down M&amp;S's vast product range to suit an individual's wants and needs. A bespoke system is in development but won't come on stream until 2014. Christmas may have been a turkey, but M&amp;S has a lot to digest in 2013.",

      "bodyText": "The dismal scenes that unfolded at Honda's factory in Swindon last week, as staff were told that 800 people were to be fired, have been all too familiar for their fellow car workers across Europe. While resurgent US auto firms will be celebrating their return from the brink at this week's Detroit motor show, thousands of jobs are going at sites in France, Germany and Belgium too, as the industry makes the painful realisation that it is producing far too many cars. While the names of Aulnay in France, Genk in Belgium and Bochum in Germany are unfamiliar to most drivers in the UK, these are the plants that have produced Citro\u00ebns, Fords and Opels for decades. By 2016 they will be closed, victims of the stark fact that western European factories made 16m cars and vans in 2007 but are now churning out vehicles into a market that only sold 12.5m last year. In France, this realignment with shrunken demand is particularly galling for a country that prides itself on homegrown industrial names such as the now-merged Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn. French car sales fell by 14% to 1.9m in 2012, their lowest level for 15 years. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association is expected to announce that sales declined by 8%-10% in 2012. A double-digit decline would represent the continent's worst performance in nearly two decades. It is against this backdrop that Honda's Swindon plant, which exports its vehicles to the rest of Europe, is cutting nearly a quarter of its workers. Honda said: \"Sustained conditions of low demand in European markets make it necessary to realign Honda's business structure.\" At the Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn factory in the depressed Paris suburb of Aulnay, a community is adjusting to the consequences of the capacity glut. The plant's 3,000-strong workforce is uncertain, fearful and angry. Half of those employed at the site are likely to be laid off when it closes in 2014. The other half have been told they may be retrained or given jobs elsewhere in the company. However, nobody knows which half they are likely to be in, and with talks between unions and management deadlocked, a debilitating sense of insecurity prevails. Didier Georget, 46, who has worked at Aulnay for 17 years, said: \"If this plant closes, it will have a catastrophic effect on the local area, which is already very depressed. We cannot say we feel betrayed because that assumes a relationship with the company owners which has never existed, but we feel as if we are being thrown on the scrapheap.\" Vauxhall-Opel, owned by General Motors, has undergone the same process, sparing the Ellesmere Port site on the Wirral but shutting Bochum. Despite market conditions, there is a deep sense of injustice among the workforce at Aulnay \u2013 which specialises in small cars and has turned out more than 8m vehicles since it opened in 1973 \u2013 who just a few years ago were being praised for record-breaking production. Meanwhile, at the home of the US industry in Detroit, executives are preparing to crown their recovery from the depths of the 2008 crisis at the city's annual gathering. US car and light truck sales exceeded 17m at their pre-crisis peak but collapsed to just over 10m in 2009, as the US government was forced to bail out two of the big three US carmakers, General Motors and Chrysler. That intervention was underpinned by pump-priming of the US economy under the Obama administration that helped to underpin demand for vehicles. Sales rose by 10% in 2010 and 2011 and grew by 13.4% in 2012, to 14.5m. Apart from a flurry of car scrappage schemes during the credit crunch, the comparison with Europe now is stark. David Bailey, a car industry expert at Coventry University business school, said: \"On the demand side, Obama has put more emphasis on growth rather than austerity and people are more willing to go out and spend money. On the supply side I would argue that American car companies are in a better state because the government intervened.\" The European carmakers at Detroit cannot rely on the same state backing. Paul Everitt, chief executive of the UK Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: \"The key European markets are mired in a combination of uncertainty because of the general concerns about the eurozone and the wave of austerity that the individual governments are pursuing. We risk doing irreparable damage to our industrial capability.\" The redundancies in Genk, Aulnay, Bochum and now Swindon could be followed by thousands more.",

      "bodyText": "The Conservative party is in such a state over Europe that the Obama administration has had to remind it in public that the much-treasured special relationship between Britain and the US depends these days on this nation's presence in the EU, rather than its defection. Conservative sceptics who complain that this is not the kind of European Union that was envisaged when we entered need to go back in history. The idea that the wool has been pulled over the British public's eyes does not fit too easily with the public record of the late 60s and early 70s. Indeed, in those days it was manifest that our fellow Europeans were aiming at monetary union by 1980. Older readers will remember the Werner Report, which set out the plans. Then came the breakup of the Bretton Woods fixed-but-adjustable exchange rate system, the first oil crisis, and the collapse of assorted stout parties. Paradoxically, however, the disruption of earlier plans led, after a long time-lag, to the second attempt, as the European monetary system, inaugurated in 1978-79, prepared the way for the single currency of 1999 via the Single European Act of 1986, signed by that veritable mistress of detail, one Margaret Thatcher. The EMS, better known for its principal component, the European exchange rate mechanism, was an attempt to create a \"zone of monetary stability\" in Europe in the face of Washington's benign neglect of relationships between countries' exchange rates. The dollar was no longer to be the linchpin of the system. Many of us rather hoped that monetary union had been kicked into touch, but the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the reunification of Germany in 1990 aroused fears on the part of both President Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Kohl of Germany that Germany might become too dominant. With the sacrifice of the deutschmark, Germany signed up to the single currency, the political aim being the achievement of a European Germany, rather than a German Europe. Contrary to the views of many people in this country, modern Germany bends over backwards to deny any suggestion of plans to dominate Europe. It was amusing last week to hear a senior executive of BMW, which now owns Rolls-Royce, going out of his way to insist that Rolls-Royce was still \"a British company\". Ironically, however, it is easy for Germany's good intentions to be misinterpreted, because the way that economic policy has evolved in Europe since the onset of the financial crisis has been led by Germany and is based on the same false premise as the economic policy pursued by a certain coalition closer to home. The premise is that austerity, or planned penury, contains the seeds of economic revival. \"Expansionary fiscal contraction\" is the oxymoronic term for what is being practised in the UK and most of the eurozone. I have many times tried to point out that what makes sense for the individual or household does not make sense for the entire economy. As the indefatigable Paul Krugman puts it: \"A family can decide to spend less and try to earn more. But in the economy as a whole, spending and earning go together: my spending is your income; your spending is my income. If everyone tries to slash spending at the same time, incomes will fall \u2013 and unemployment will soar.\" After a period of selective amnesia, economists at the International Monetary Fund and elsewhere have rediscovered the \"multiplier\" \u2013 the insight given to Keynes by his lesser-known colleague Richard Kahn. Traditionally this is discussed in terms of the way that extra public spending or lower taxes can have a \"multiplier\" effect in stimulating demand and activity in the economy as a whole. Now, for reasons that ought to have been obvious, they are discovering that the multiplier effect can work the other way as well. Why, the impact of needless austerity on peripheral eurozone countries is now affecting the outlook in Germany itself, via lower demand for its exports. This is not to say that the contraction induced by the current fashion for austerity and cuts is entirely responsible for our economic troubles. In recent years there has been the unfortunate concatenation of the banking crisis (still very much with us in Europe), the rise in the price of oil and food, and, in the UK's case, the added impact on import prices of the 2007-9 devaluation of the pound. Yet devaluation, long delayed, was necessary because of the deterioration in our trading position associated with the neglect of manufacturing and the way policymakers relied too much on financial services. Even now, during a prolonged depression, Britain is not paying its way in the world, and is in a significant balance-of-payments deficit. As the economist John Mills points out, the real source of concern in this country is the trading position rather than the budgetary one. The implication is disturbing, but it is a judgment that appears to be shared by the governor of the Bank of England: the exchange rate is still too high! If the markets were to take this view, then there would be a further squeeze on people's real incomes as import prices rose again. All things considered, the last thing this country and this economy needs is the coalition's austerity programme, which depresses demand even further.",

      "bodyText": "The problem with banker jokes, as the old saying goes, is that bankers don't think they're funny while normal people don't think they're jokes. Vince Cable once tried one (with limited success) but his travails have failed to deter other thrusting wags from having a crack at the genre, so expect a few new efforts this week as the major American banks report earnings. There will be outings for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Bank of America, who will also tell us how much their jumped-up bookmakers are set to trouser this year. Broadly, bonuses are expected to be down \u2013 possibly by as much as 50% in some London-based banks, where the courageous actions of a few shareholders last spring have meant obscene awards are (currently) out of vogue, especially if bonuses are larger than dividends. Meanwhile, the Financial Services Authority is telling the sector's remuneration committees that bonuses need to reflect recent scandals \u2013 of which, you might have noticed, there have been a few. Still, lower bonuses does not mean no bonuses, and recent analysis by the Guardian showed that the top 1,500 UK bank staff received an average of \u00a31m in 2011. Ironically, bankers find that figure amusing \u2013 while most normal people know it's a joke. You wouldn't bet against IG When Stuart Wheeler founded the Investors Gold Index in the 1970s, it allowed punters to have a bet on the price of gold bullion when you could end up in prison for buying the real thing. His clever idea grew into what we now know as the spread-betting giant IG Group, which made Wheeler so rich that he could afford to attempt restorations of crumbling old relics such as Kent's Chilham Castle in 2002 and the Conservative party in 2001. Wheeler no longer has any of his shares, but IG's success has continued. Still, after a stellar start to the financial crisis, when volatile markets meant more punters fancied a bet, the calmer past few months have started to hit IG's top line. It will release interim figures on Tuesday, when it is expected to say conditions remain tough, and indeed Investec has already cut 2013 revenue expectations by 6%. That sounds like bad news, but it may not really prove to be. IG has loyal customers and is growing in emerging markets \u2013 which means it isn't finding life nearly as tough as the smaller rivals from whom it is stealing market share. Those gains will come in handy when conditions improve. Some bookies, it seems, really do always win. High street's new look Just how bad can the high street get? We'll get some clues this week as the Office for National Statistics gives us news on retail sales, while Tuesday will see December's inflation figures, which look likely to have eroded consumer spending power further. Currently there is a growing consensus that inflation \u2013 which is standing at 2.7% on the CPI measure \u2013 could climb back above 3% fairly soon (if it hasn't done already), and if the economists break their run and call it correctly, chancellor George Osborne will be receiving an explanation on Bank of England notepaper presently. All that comes against last week's news of the collapse of camera chain Jessops, while we also get updates this week from retailers ranging from the embattled to the recovering, as Burberry, Dixons, Home Retail Group, Mothercare and Halfords report. Some thinkers have begun arguing that the high street is being blown over not just by economic woe, but also by Schumpeter's gale \u2013 a period of \"creative destruction\" whereby an old economic order is replaced by the new. And who knows? These intellectuals might even be right and we really will require fewer shops in the future. Whatever, whether we need fewer shops or not, that's certainly what we're getting.",
