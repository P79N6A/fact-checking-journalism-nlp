      "bodyText": "New South Wales has claimed success in reforms designed to stop real estate agents from underquoting as Victoria embarks on similar legal changes in an attempt to crack down on the practice. NSW Fair Trading says complaints about underquoting have been in steady decline since the commencement of the reforms at the beginning of 2016. The changes mean that agents can no longer give understated or vague property prices \u2013 for example, by using phrases like \u201coffers above\u201d \u2013 and if audited need to provide documentation to Fair Trading as to how they valued a property. A Fair Trading spokesman told Guardian Australia that a compliance program check conducted in March identified 13 agents to be non-compliant with the new laws. But, overall, complaints from prospective buyers about underquoting had dropped, he said. \u201cIn 2015, 236 complaints were received about underquoting,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2016 to date, 165 complaints have been received with a steady decline since February. The drop in complaints about underquoting since the new laws commenced, and the positive reaction to the underquoting law reforms from real estate agents, indicates that the new laws have been very successful.\u201d Victoria introduced its legislation to crack down on underquoting on Thursday. The laws will take effect from January. Under the new laws, agents must provide prospective buyers with three recent comparable sales, an indicative selling price and the median price for the suburb. Advertising price ranges of more than 10% will be banned and, like in NSW, terms like \u201coffers above\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d will be banned from pricing. Agents will also be audited. Earlier this month, the real estate agency Hocking Stuart admitted to underquoting in the competitive property market of Richmond, located 3km from Melbourne\u2019s CBD. Consumer Affairs Victoria told the federal court last week that the agency should face a severe fine. The agency is part of one of 13 investigations underway by Consumer Affairs Victoria. But buyers\u2019 agent and the chief executive of EPS Property Search, Patrick Bright, is not persuaded that the reforms are effective. He believes more can be done to increase transparency in the industry and to protect buyers from underquoting. \u201cAll the government has done is fiddle around the edges with their reforms,\u201d Bright said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say an agent puts $1m as the price guide and then a buyer makes an offer of $1.1m, which the vendor then rejects. There\u2019s no requirement for the agent to change the guide from $1m to $1.1m in the advertisements \u201cI\u2019ve also had sales agents and vendors tell me they get around the legislation by saying to the vendor, \u2018I know you want $1m but that price may scare off buyers. Would you mind if I put $900,000 on the paperwork to get interest, and then we will work buyers up from there?\u2019.\u201d Bright has launched a petition on change.org calling for the NSW government to require that vendors and agents publish the reserve price of a property before the auction. A similar petition has also been launched in Victoria. Bright believes the reserve should be made public at least seven days before auction. \u201cThat still gives prospective buyers enough time to organise and pay for building and pest reports but allows them to drop out if they realise the property is beyond their price range,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unfair to entice people to come to an auction and spend money, time and energy when the the truth is the reserve is set at a price where they were never even in the running.\u201d However, the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales president, John Cunningham, said he believes the reforms have made a positive difference and go far enough to protect prospective buyers. He said prospective buyers sometimes wrongfully attributed being out of the running for a property to underquoting, when in fact it was just the market at play. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to point the figure and say it\u2019s underquoting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe recently had a property where we gave a guide of $800-850,000 but the market indicated that people would be willing to pay $850-900,000, so we revised the quote. It ended up going for $920,000. It can be an inexact science.\u201d Sydney\u2019s property market was particularly difficult for vendors and agents to predict, he added, and said that, despite sales well over the reserve price being rare, those sales were the ones most often publicised giving buyers the impression of rampant underquoting. \u201cWe have volatile market conditions; in Sydney we have the lowest supply I\u2019ve seen in 40 years in the industry combined with the highest demand,\u201d he said. \u201cThe percentage of complaints is so minimal compared to the amount of properties sold. Ultimately people love the auction system, because it is one of the most transparent systems of buying there is.\u201d He disagreed that publishing the reserve price before the auction was reasonable. He believes that, too often, people think only of the problems faced by prospective buyers, rather than the rights of the vendor. \u201cNever in my career have I seen a vendor set reserve price any closer to an auction than two or three days before,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know where to set the reserve until you gather all the feedback.\u201d Victoria\u2019s minister for consumer affairs, Marlene Kairouz, said she was confident that Victoria\u2019s reforms would lead to more transparency and set the right balance between the rights of the buyer and the vendor. \u201cProspective buyers expect and are entitled to a level playing field,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about making sure they don\u2019t waste time and money on properties they can\u2019t afford. These laws send a strong message to agents: think twice before you underquote properties to our homebuyers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is to start charging major financial institutions for any cash it holds on their behalf for trading purposes, in the latest illustration of the impact of Mark Carney\u2019s post-Brexit vote stimulus package. It is the first time a bank has started to make charges for sterling deposits since the governor of the Bank of England announced on 4 August that interest rates would be cut from 0.5% to 0.25% to stave off any economic downturn following the vote to leave the EU. Carney said he was not a fan of negative rates. Even so, from Monday, about 70 RBS customers will start to receive negative rates because they will charged for any cash they place as collateral for trading in complex financial products, such as futures or options. The move will not affect the small business customers whom the bank, and its NatWest arm, warned last month it may have to charge for making deposits. Negative rates, though, will be applied for customers who trade through RBS on deals guaranteed by clearing houses. RBS is 73% owned by the taxpayer. An RBS spokesman said: \u201cUntil recently, RBS has applied a 0% floor to the overnight rate charged for deposits required by clearing houses for futures trades. However, due to the sustained low interest rate environment, RBS will now be passing the cost of holding such deposits on to a limited number of our institutional clients. Futures are entered into by sophisticated financial investors looking to hedge risk.\u201d While the rate cut has reduced borrowing rates for mortgage customers, savers are paying a price. \u201cWe are still a long way from banks imposing negative interest rates on personal customers, which would be a deeply unpopular move, though clearly the direction of travel is concerning for savers,\u201d said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. A table of savings rates compiled by Savings Champion, a consumer website, shows the lowest rate offered at 0% by specialist bank Weatherbys for a 45-day and 90-day notice account. Other accounts are offering 0.01% \u2013 such as that offered by Danske Bank \u2013 while Barclays on Friday announced it would cut its \u201ceveryday savers\u201d rate to 0.05% on 1 December. The rate was previously 0.25% on this account although Susan Hannums of Savings Champion said Barclays was transferring some savers to this account who had previously been getting 1%. \u201cThis means the savers who originally were in the [previous account] will see their rate drop from 1% to 0.05% in less than 2 months,\u201d said Hannums. The rate was for customers who joined Barclays when it bought the UK arm of ING. Barclays joined other banks \u2013 such as HSBC\u2019s First Direct \u2013 in passing on a cut to savings rates that was larger than the Bank of England\u2019s quarter point reduction. For instance, the rate on an instant cash ISA will fall from 0.8% to 0.4%. It was reported on Friday that the Bank of Ireland, which is 14% owned by the state, will charge big companies 0.4% to place deposits overnight. Rates are negative in the eurozone.",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners against low pay are hoping that a victory for Deliveroo couriers this week will encourage further action by gig economy workers. One of the biggest barriers to a repeat, however, is the very nature of the work Britain\u2019s part-time, self-employed army carries out. Workers at Deliveroo, the online food delivery firm, won a rare victory in seeing off an attempt to force them to sign up to new pay terms. Deliveroo\u2019s change of heart followed several days of protests by its drivers. The protests, in which more than 100 moped riders and cyclists took to the streets after being told they would have to move from an hourly rate to payment per delivery, marked a new assertiveness among workers in the UK\u2019s so-called gig economy. Dr Alex Wood, a sociologist at Oxford University who is studying the gig economy and collective action, said the success of the Deliveroo strike could motivate other workers. \u201cOne of the most important elements for any action is that they believe there is a chance of it being successful,\u201d he said. \u201cThat fact that the workers have got some concessions out of it will inspire other workers to think it is worthwhile.\u201d The Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, who has been campaigning for better treatment of low-paid workers, is less optimistic. She said it was hard for those employed in the gig economy - the term for temporary, self-employed work - to organise and agitate for better pay and conditions. \u201cThey are not in the same workplace and there is not the same unity of cause. There is always somebody who will do it if you don\u2019t want to. There is a big role for unions in this area, but they will have to change the way they are working and offer different services,\u201d she said. Mags Dewhurst, the chair of the couriers and logistics branch of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) helped the Deliveroo drivers draw up a list of demands. She said she had tried to recruit workers before the recent pay protests, but without much luck. \u201cThe difficulty we faced had been accessing them. How do you reach thousands of people when they are spread around London? I was literally chasing them down the street if I saw a blue jacket.\u201d Several major trade unions are considering how they can adapt to the fast-growing gig economy. Wood raises the possibility of a move towards something similar to \u201cworker centres\u201d in the US, where volunteers offer resources and advice to those on low pay. Legal test cases also have a role to play. The GMB union is backing a court case taken by 19 drivers for taxi-hailing app Uber, who say they are employees rather than self-employed. A ruling in their favour could have far-reaching implications for gig economy businesses. The GMB became involved after existing members began working for Uber and asked for advice. The IWGB is backing action by cycle couriers at four firms starting later this year. Alice Martin, a unions expert at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cMajor unions can play a really important role as they have the clout needed to take on these big cases, that strong presence, resources and expertise.\u201d There are challenges, however, for unions that consider the cost of engaging with self-employed workers in the gig economy to be too high, according to Wood. \u201cThere\u2019s a high turnover of people and there\u2019s low market bargaining power. If they go on strike it\u2019s not going to bring the economy to a halt, unlike coal miners or rail workers,\u201d he said. Social media and digital technology will probably play a key role in low-pay campaigns, he added. \u201cEven amongst the workers who are working around the world from home we find most of them join online social networks through Facebook, forums and blogs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much formal training in the gig economy so the only way they can make it work for them is to get support from other workers. They need to learn from each other. They\u2019ll find ways to meet up and exchange information. These networks form the basis for people to share dissatisfactions.\u201d The use of social media has taken employers by surprise. Workers for Deliveroo and the parcel firm Hermes have used closed social media groups to exchange information about things they are unhappy about, and messages about the protests were spread on open Facebook group pages and on Twitter. Dewhurst said firms\u2019 reliance on digital technology for their business models also laid them open to the possibility of workers\u2019 action. Although this kind of tech has been designed to isolate individuals and atomise work, deskilling the industry and driving down wages, the very platform it uses to do that is hugely vulnerable to ad-hoc collective action by groups of individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s now very easy for Deliveroo to hire and fire people, but equally easy for drivers to decide not to work, and when they decide do to it altogether, can garner huge leverage against their would-be employer. All they need to do is log out.\u201d Whether traditional unions are ready and able to engage with workers in the digital world remains to be seen. Martin said: \u201cA lot needs to be done in terms of [traditional unions\u2019] digital capacity.\u201d Referring to digital voting, she said: \u201cTraditional unions have found it notoriously hard as some technological changes have to be written into law.\u201d The TUC has spent several years campaigning for the right to conduct digital ballots, but was only able to win the right to a review of the concept and a pilot scheme in the controversial Trade Union Act brought in this year. Martin said it was possible new unions and staff-led groups might have to fill the void if traditional unions were unable to. Dewhurst said the events of the past 10 days were \u201cjust a taste of what could happen\u201d when low-paid workers campaign together. \u201cThe biggest problem people face is getting in contact with each other. Once they are in contact and they have decided to work with one voice, they have effectively unionised and the company is screwed,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "The number of oil rigs in the US increased again last week in a further sign of raised production. The Baker Hughes weekly report showed 10 rigs were added in all, taking the total to 491 and marking the eighth weekly increase in a row. All of them were oil rigs with no gas rigs added. The crude price, which was at eight week highs earlier in the week on hopes of a deal next month to freeze output, is hovering in negative territory following the figures. Brent crude is down 0.49% at $50.64 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has slipped lower and is off 0.06% at $48.19. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the week. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Heading into the weekend, the uncertainty over when the US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates has made for a cautious end to the trading week. Dovish minutes on Wednesday suggested a rate hike was off the table in the near future but subsequent comments from Fed members seemed to indicate otherwise. With oil slipping back from its recent highs, markets came under pressure again, although the August lull has meant trading volumes are thin. The final scores showed: The FTSe 100 finished down 10.01 points or 0.15% at 6858.95, with the index recording its worst weekly performance since mid-June Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.55% to 10,544.36 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.82% lower at 4400.52 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.18% to 16,310.06 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.16% at 8450.6 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.91% to 561.32 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 24 points or 0.13% lower. And here comes the denial: A Bloomberg report suggesting that the UK government wants to trigger Article 50 - the start of the two year Brexit process - by next April has sent the pound lower. Up until now, the UK was expected to delay Article 50 until at least the end of next year. ETX Capital said: Big sell-off in sterling this afternoon amid rumours the UK wants to invoke Article 50 in the first half of 2017. Cable is down more than 1% and flirting with the $1.30 level again after a report said Theresa May would like to start the exit process before French and German elections next year. That means invoking Article 50 by April, putting paid to speculation that the UK would have several years to prepare to leave the EU. The less time the UK has to get things in order, the greater the market fears the fallout. But sterling is still on course to end the week higher, having enjoyed solid gains on much stronger-than-expected retail sales yesterday, which suggests consumers at least are not downcast. The pound is currently down 0.9% at $1.3052 and 0.6% lower against the euro at $1.1521. As expected, US markets have followed the trend elsewhere, slipping back in early trading on talk of the Federal Reserve perhaps hiking rates sooner than had been expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 94 points or 0.5% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened around 0.2% lower. Earlier this week there were protests outside the Bank of England against its quantitative easing programme, with calls for different measures to be used. One such is so-called helicopter money, and one supporter of the idea is Marino Valensise, head of the multi asset and income at Barings. He says: In simple terms, HM is \u201cmonetary financing of fiscal spending\u201d, a central bank who prints money for its government to spend; a practice definitely not included in the Bundesbank\u2019s instruction manual. However, we should keep an open mind after all - Mario Draghi sees it as a \u201cvery interesting concept\u201d and Loretta Mester from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland considers it a possible \u201cnext step if \u2026 we wanted to be more accommodative\u201d. It is therefore important that we analyse, in simple terms, how HM could work. The first step would be to assess whether this type of monetary financing is allowed under current laws and regulations. In most jurisdictions, rules exist and limit the actions of a central bank. Examples include Article 123 of the Treaty of Lisbon (EU), Article 5 of the Fiscal Act (Japan) and the Treasury Fed Accord of 1951 (US). However, loopholes and safe harbour clauses are easy to identify as most central banks are allowed to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to fulfil their mandate. In practice, the central bank would deliver money to the treasury by receiving a meaningless asset (i.e. a zero coupon perpetual bond) in exchange, or \u2013 preferably - without any quid pro quo agreement. In either case, there would be no planned reimbursement for the sums extended. It is important that \u2013 at least for some time \u2013 this money creation is seen as permanent and irreversible, to avoid creating fears of challenging times ahead, and the associated desire to save, not spend or invest. The more orthodox central bankers have nothing to fear as they would be in the driving seat. They would have the power to impose conditions and participate in the decision-making process of how this money should be spent. In addition to ageing demographics in a number of key economic areas, there are three issues today that should be tackled. These are anaemic aggregate demand, persistence of excess supply and a growing social inequality. Any HM initiative must be dedicated to projects that aim to cure these. It should help the majority of households by increasing their welfare and enhancing their disposable income, fostering confidence and promoting consumer spending, in order to benefit the majority of the population rather than enrich asset-holders by inflating financial asset prices. There could also be spending on long-term themes like education, and on structural issues strangling the economy, such as the banking\u2019s sector non-performing assets. We need a fiscal plan that aims to generate real prosperity without incurring public indebtedness, or offsetting its benefits with fears of a gloomier future in which debts must be repaid. It should also attempt to create inflation expectations, and trigger higher interest rates. While higher borrowing costs would mean weaker businesses would not survive, the profitability of the banking sector would be enhanced and insurance companies would receive crucial support. Perhaps, this policy could also lower the liabilities of defined benefit pension funds. Ultimately, inflation is the only solution to today\u2019s global debt problem. Some inflation would reduce the real value of the accumulated debt. All this considered, the question is how much money should be created and spent? The calibration of an HM policy would be much easier than that of QE. While QE relies on an uncertain transmission mechanism, whether banks will lend more or hoard the additional cash, the multiplier effect of HM is easier to forecast. Only once the growth and inflation objectives are reached, would an exit policy be publicly discussed. Any overheating would be controlled by fiscal and monetary measures. He concludes: I believe that HM is superior to QE, and much better suited to our current challenges. It represents a pragmatic and superior alternative to any other policy, although it cannot be a panacea for structural issues such as poor demographics. In a heavily indebted world, suffering from low economic growth and facing serious political issues originating from inequality, HM has the potential to outperform any other policy. We must consider it now, or be forced to implement it in a hurry when the next economic recession hits. Ahead of the US open, European markets are in negative territory as investors shy away from shares on renewed talk of a possible US interest rate rise after some hawkish comments from Federal Reserve board members. The Stoxx 600 is down around 0.7%, heading for its biggest weekly loss since the middle of June. Earlier in the week the index hit a seven week high, but such volatility is typical of summer markets with light volumes. Meanwhile Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 0.39% and France\u2019s Cac is down 0.86%. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat, however, down just 0.09% although it too is on track for its biggest weekly fall since mid-June. Oil remains above $50 a barrel although it has slipped back from recent highs, with Brent crude down 0.5% at $50.63. Sterling is fairly flat against the dollar at $1.3078 but is down 0.34% against the euro at \u20ac1.1557. Several hours ago, I promised fresh news about the economic crisis in Mongolia (we\u2019re a broad church in the liveblog). And S&amp;P have stepped up (ahem) by downgrading Mongolia\u2019s credit-rating from B to B-. That\u2019s deep into \u2018junk\u2019 territory, and just five notches above default. The credit rating agency also slashed its growth forecast in 2016 to 1.3%, down from 2.6%. It says: Our lower growth estimate stems partly from the ancillary effects of Mongolia\u2019s weaker terms of trade and partly from the country\u2019s mixed mining policies, which discouraged foreign direct investment. Another key deteriorating risk factor for Mongolia relates to its public finances. Mongolia has been hit hard by China\u2019s slowing economy, which eroded demand for its natural resources. That has left Mongolia short of foreign currency reserves, and pushed its deficit up. The country\u2019s new finance minister warned of a \u201cdeep economic crisis\u201d last week, which could leave it unable to pay civil servants\u2019 salaries. The Mongolian currency, the togrog, has been sliding in value ever since, forcing Mongolia\u2019s central bank to hike interest rates by 4.5% (!) yesterday, to 15%. Mongolia hasn\u2019t been a world power for centuries, so it\u2019s not too surprising that this crisis has slipped under the radar. But it\u2019s still worth taking seriously. Bloomberg have done a great piece on Mongolia\u2019s problems - here\u2019s a flavour: Mongolia, a mineral-rich and landlocked $12 billion economy bordering Russia and China, is staring at a full-blown balance of payments crisis. It\u2019s caused barely a ripple in global financial markets, but the nation\u2019s economic meltdown offers instructive lessons to far bigger resource-reliant economies like Brazil, Venezuela, Russia and Saudi Arabia. This is an economy that gives new meaning to what economists call the resource curse. An overabundance of natural resources can result in lopsided economic growth, government waste and boom-bust cycles that can leave a country\u2019s finances in tatters. \u201cMongolia should be much richer than it is,\u201d said Lutz Roehmeyer, a money manager at Landesbank Berlin Investment who helps oversee about $12 billion of investments including local-currency Mongolian debt. \u201cThere is nowhere else in the world where it is so easy to dig up resources without any problems and sell the commodities to China with such low transportation costs.\u201d Britain\u2019s independent fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has warned that the government is on track to overshoot its borrowing targets in 2016-17. The OBR is concerned that tax receipt growths have slowed this year, pulling July\u2019s surplus down to only \u00a31bn. Unless that changes, Britain would fail to cut the deficit to \u00a355.5bn this financial year (from \u00a375.3bn), it fears. Here\u2019s the OBR\u2019s official response to today\u2019s figures (i\u2019ve bolded the key points): 1) Public sector net borrowing (PSNB) recorded a surplus of \u00a31.0 billion in July, a \u00a30.2 billion deterioration on last year\u2019s surplus. The surplus was \u00a30.9 billion below market expectations. July is usually the second highest month for receipts during the financial year, reflecting the timing of corporation tax and self-assessment (SA) payments. 2) The underlying reason for the slightly smaller surplus than last year was that the 2.2 per cent growth in central government accrued receipts (excluding APF transfers) was slower than the 4.2 per cent growth in central government spending (excluding grants to local authorities). The rise in central government spending mostly reflected growth in departmental spending. Growth in central government receipts was depressed by weak income tax receipts, although this partly reflects timing effects as the first self-assessment (SA) payment deadline fell on a weekend this year. 3) Meeting our March EFO forecast for PSNB in 2016-17 would require it to fall by \u00a319.8 billion over the full financial year. A third of the way through the financial year, PSNB was only \u00a33.0 billion lower than last year. While prospects for the rest of the year are subject to greater uncertainty than usual due to the result of the EU referendum, it is still worth noting that receipts and spending data are volatile from month to month and prone to revision, especially at this relatively early stage of the year. 4) However, despite these timing effects, there is still evidence that growth in PAYE, NICs and stamp duty land tax (SDLT) was slower in the first four months of the year than would be required to meet our March forecast for the year as a whole. July\u2019s data cover the first full month since the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU, but a very substantial proportion of the data in this month\u2019s release is either a forecast or still reflects economic activity prior to the referendum. That means there is still little firm evidence on how the referendum result might affect the public finances this year. More here. The pound has dropped by half a cent against the US dollar so far today, to $1.312. But even so, sterling has still gained 1.6%, or two cents, this week. The pound has rallied as new inflation, unemployment and retail sales figures all came in stronger than expected, easing fears of an immediate slump following the Brexit vote. Here\u2019s our new Boom or Doom round-up of the week\u2019s economic data: In other news, Britain\u2019 s housing market seemed to cool last month, with estate agents seeing fewer potential buyers.... John McDonnell MP, Shadow Chancellor, is concerned that Britain\u2019s \u00a31bn surplus in July is smaller than a year ago. He says: Today\u2019s public finances show a budget surplus that has fallen compared to this time last year. And the Treasury\u2019s own comparisons of independent economic forecasts show a dramatic revision downwards in growth and upwards in inflation, unemployment and public sector net borrowing. McDonnell argues that the government should be urgently revising its fiscal plans, rather than leaving us all in suspense until the autumn statement: The UK economy needs immediate investment from the Government, rather than sticking to the failed policies of George Osborne which have helped create the problem. Britain is on hold waiting for Philip Hammond to tell us whether he will stick to his predecessor\u2019s planned cuts to investment, and firms and households can\u2019t wait until the autumn to find out. \u201cThe country needs a different plan that will end austerity, and start to invest in the infrastructure and housing a 21st century economy demands. That\u2019s why Labour would invest \u00a3500 billion to rebuild and transform our economy.\u201d Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics has crunched today\u2019s public finance numbers, and concluded that the government is on track to miss its borrowing target for 2016-17. Here\u2019s his workings out: He reckons this will give Philip Hammond little wriggle room (unless he abandons deficit reduction altogether, I guess) \u201cJuly\u2019s relatively small surplus means that the Chancellor will be able to put together only a modest package of measures to support the economy in the Autumn Statement later this year.\u201d Chancellor Philip Hammond will be \u201cslightly disappointed\u201d that July\u2019s surplus dipped to just below \u00a31bn, from \u00a31.2bn in July 2015, reckons Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. July usually sees a surplus in the public finances as it is a key month for tax receipts). While the public finances are expected to be increasingly pressurized by the Brexit vote going forward, it was premature for there to have been much impact in July. However, the ONS did indicate that the July figures included forecasts and the data can also be influenced by different timings of tax payments. George Osborne has put down his gun and turned to Twitter: And here it is... Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, isn\u2019t terribly impressed by today\u2019s numbers: \u201cJuly\u2019s surplus was smaller than the \u00a31.2bn surplus recorded in July 2015 and left public borrowing in the fiscal year to date at \u00a323.7bn, only 11.3% lower than the \u00a326.7bn seen in the same period in 2015-16. This compares with the OBR\u2019s Budget forecast of a 26.3% drop in borrowing for 2016-17 as a whole. That forecast will be history, though, though, if Philip Hammond tears up gun-totin\u2019 George Osborne\u2019s fiscal strategy..... Here\u2019s Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, on today\u2019s public finance data: \u2018July is normally one of the bumper months for tax receipts, because HMRC gets a lot of payments of income tax from self-employed people, and also quarterly corporation tax payments from companies, which is why the government found itself quids in last month. Of course the elephant in the room is Brexit, and what effect this will have on tax receipts going forward, but so far the hard economic data has actually been pretty robust, though it\u2019s obviously very early days. Laith adds that chancellor Philip Hammond may tear up the government\u2019s austerity programme in the autumn statement: That could well see previous borrowing targets thrown out of the window, if the new government decides supporting the economy is more important than keeping a lid on debt.\u2019 PwC chief economist John Hawksworth has cast his expert eye over Britain\u2019s public finances, and concluded that they\u2019re not too shabby. \u201cThe public finances were in surplus by \u00a31 billion in July, which is a reasonable performance albeit slightly down on the \u00a31.2 billion budget surplus recorded in July 2015. \u201cFor the four months to July, the cumulative budget deficit in this financial year is running around \u00a33 billion lower than in the same period last year, though the rate of deficit reduction has been slower than the OBR forecast back in March. But while there\u2019s no immediate sign of a Brexit shock, the full impact of June\u2019s referendum won\u2019t be seen for some time (as ONS chief economist Joe Grice also warned this morning). Hawksworth explains: \u201cOverall, as with other official data released this week for retail sales and the unemployment claimant count, there is no real sign yet of a downturn in economic fortunes following the Brexit vote. But it will be some months before we get a clearer picture of this as it will take time for companies to adjust their investment and hiring plans to the new post-referendum environment.\u201d The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke, says today\u2019s public finances show Britain is in good shape to handle the aftermath of the EU referendum vote. Here\u2019s his official statement: \u201cWith the public finances in surplus in July, our economy starts from a position of strength to face any economic turbulence following the vote to leave the EU. \u201cAs we keep working to cut the deficit, we are well-placed to handle any challenges and seize the opportunities as our economy adjusts. We are determined to build on our economic strengths to ensure Britain is a country that works for everyone.\u201d Correction: The UK national debt is \u00a31.6 TRILLION, of course, not \u00a31.6bn. Apologies, and thanks to those of you who kindly pointed it out. #grauniad. July\u2019s \u00a31bn surplus won\u2019t make much of a dent in Britain\u2019s national debt. The UK now owes \u00a31.6 trillion  to investors, which equates to 82.9% of GDP (the value of all the goods and services currently produced by the UK economy in a year). But the national debt does seem to be levelling out, as a percentage of GDP. Fraser Munro, public sector finance statistician at the ONS, is tweeting the key points from today\u2019s data. This chart shows how the UK has borrowed less this year, than in 2015-2016. More details: Anyone looking for evidence of Brexit vote impact in today\u2019s report should tread cautiously, says the ONS, as the figures could easily be revised in future. The data presented in this bulletin presents the latest fiscal position of the public sector as at 31 July 2016 and so includes the first post-EU referendum data. However, estimates for the latest period always contain a substantial forecast element and so any post-referendum impact may not become clear for some time. The BBC\u2019s Joe Lynam reminds us that July\u2019s public finances are usually decent, as firms often pay their quarterly corporation tax bills. Breaking: Britain ran a surplus of \u00a31bn in July, thanks to a pick-up in corporation tax receipts. That\u2019s less than some analysts had expected. But this means that so far this financial year, UK has borrowed \u00a33bn less than a year ago, suggesting that the government\u2019s deficit-reduction plan may still be on course. The Public sector net borrowing requirement in July came in at minus \u00a31.472bn last month, the Office for National Statistics reports. Excluding the impact of state-owned banks, and the surplus shrinks to \u00a3977m. Corporation tax receipts were the strongest for any July since 2011, the ONS adds. And this means that Britain has borrowed \u00a323.7bn since the start of the financial year in April, which is the smallest deficit since the financial crisis. More here: Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit agrees with Joe Grice.... Today\u2019s public finances will show whether the UK government is still on track to hit its deficit targets for this financial year. Former chancellor George Osborne has his mind on other issues, though \u2013 he\u2019s been spied blasting a machine gun at a former Viet Cong base near Ho Chi Minh city. Probably less dangerous than inflicting his threatened punishment budget on the UK.... A lacklustre start to trading has seen London\u2019s FTSE 100 index drop by 17 points, or 0.24%, to 6852 points. But budget airline easyJet is defying the selloff. Its shares have jumped by 2.6% to the top of the Footsie leaderboard. The Times\u2019s Dominic Walsh has heard some chatter about a possible takeover, but it sounds pretty speculative. And in a quiet summer, it doesn\u2019t take much to move shares. So we shall see.... Oil has hit its highest level since the EU referendum, driven by ongoing speculation that producers could reach some kind of deal soon. Brent hit $51.22 per barrel, an eight-week high, putting it on track for its eighth day in a row. Traders are calculating that the OPEC cartel might agree some measures to shore up the oil price, when they meet in Algeria in September The Telegraph\u2019s Tara Cunningham flags up that oil has now gained 22% since August 2, putting it in a Bull Market again. Quite a turnaround in two weeks.... This was billed as the week when Britain would discover the economic pain caused by the Brexit vote. And the patient looks to be in better health than some experts had feared. So far, we\u2019ve learned that: Inflation: rose to 0.6% in July from 0.5%, but with no evidence of a Brexit effect Unemployment: A welcome fall in the claimant count in July, while the jobless rate remained at 4.9% in April-June Retail Sales: Smashed expectations in July, with a 1.4% jump So can we put fears of a Brexit recession to bed? Not according to Joe Grice, the chief economist of the Office for National Statistics. Speaking on Bloomberg TV this morning, Grice explained that it\u2019s too early to really know the impact of the EU referendum vote. For example, the labour market report shows that Brexit uncertainty in the run-up to the referendum didn\u2019t hurt the economy much, but doesn\u2019t really show the impact of the vote. The 1.4% jump in July retail sales, though, is \u201chard\u201d evidence of what\u2019s happening in the real economy. All retail sectors did well, especially department stores and clothing shops. But.... They don\u2019t tell us anything about what businesses were doing, they don\u2019t say anything about trade.....but they do say that consumers were spending strongly. That suggests that fears of a \u201ccatastrophic fall in consumer confidence\u201d immediately after the referendum can be crossed off, as it hasn\u2019t happened, Grice adds. But still.... Does that mean there won\u2019t be a recession? No. The story is still to unfold. More details here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After a week of largely encouraging economic data from Britain, there\u2019s still one important measure before we can clock off for the weekend - July\u2019s UK public finances. Due at 9.30am, this will show whether the British government had to borrow from international investors to balance the books in the weeks after the EU referendum. July is usually a good month for tax receipts, so the City is hoping that Westminster may actually have run a surplus - of perhaps \u00a32.2bn. That would indicate that the economy was motoring along pretty well. A poor reading, though, might reignite concerns that growth is slowing - despite the moderate price pressures, low unemployment and strong consumer spending reported this week. And a quick truffle through this morning\u2019s research notes show that analysts are a little concerned. Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics expects to be underwhelmed: The first post-referendum set of public borrowing figures look set to be disappointing. We have pencilled in a surplus of \u00a31bn in July, marginally lower than a year ago. And the team at RBS Capital Markets fears Britain may actually have run up a deficit in July: July is seasonally a good month for tax receipts with a second wave of self-assessment tax payments, quarterly corporation tax instalments and the first of three payments through the year by oil and gas firms. The OBR has said it planned for modest tax receipts from those oil and gas companies on the back of weak commodity prices. Our simple arithmetic process points to a surplus on the government budget of \u00a31bn for July, but in light of modest expectations for those tax receipts and poor outturns in earlier months of this financial year the risk is for a smaller surplus or possibly even a deficit. There\u2019s not much else on the agenda today, but we\u2019ll keep an eye on the oil price, and a nasty economic crisis unfolding in Mongolia (more on that shortly....) And in the absence of much news, European stock markets are expected to be pretty flat...",

He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In simple terms, HM is \u201cmonetary financing of fiscal spending\u201d, a central bank who prints money for its government to spend; a practice definitely not included in the Bundesbank\u2019s instruction manual. However, we should keep an open mind after all - Mario Draghi sees it as a \u201cvery interesting concept\u201d and Loretta Mester from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland considers it a possible \u201cnext step if \u2026 we wanted to be more accommodative\u201d.</p> <p>It is therefore important that we analyse, in simple terms, how HM could work. The first step would be to assess whether this type of monetary financing is allowed under current laws and regulations. In most jurisdictions, rules exist and limit the actions of a central bank.</p> <p>Examples include Article 123 of the Treaty of Lisbon (EU), Article 5 of the Fiscal Act (Japan) and the Treasury Fed Accord of 1951 (US). However, loopholes and safe harbour clauses are easy to identify as most central banks are allowed to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to fulfil their mandate. </p> <p>In practice, the central bank would deliver money to the treasury by receiving a meaningless asset (i.e. a zero coupon perpetual bond) in exchange, or \u2013 preferably - without any quid pro quo agreement. In either case, there would be no planned reimbursement for the sums extended. It is important that \u2013 at least for some time \u2013 this money creation is seen as permanent and irreversible, to avoid creating fears of challenging times ahead, and the associated desire to save, not spend or invest. </p> <p>The more orthodox central bankers have nothing to fear as they would be in the driving seat.

These are anaemic aggregate demand, persistence of excess supply and a growing social inequality. Any HM initiative must be dedicated to projects that aim to cure these.</p> <p>It should help the majority of households by increasing their welfare and enhancing their disposable income, fostering confidence and promoting consumer spending, in order to benefit the majority of the population rather than enrich asset-holders by inflating financial asset prices. There could also be spending on long-term themes like education, and on structural issues strangling the economy, such as the banking\u2019s sector non-performing assets. </p> <p>We need a fiscal plan that aims to generate real prosperity without incurring public indebtedness, or offsetting its benefits with fears of a gloomier future in which debts must be repaid. It should also attempt to create inflation expectations, and trigger higher interest rates. While higher borrowing costs would mean weaker businesses would not survive, the profitability of the banking sector would be enhanced and insurance companies would receive crucial support. Perhaps, this policy could also lower the liabilities of defined benefit pension funds. Ultimately, inflation is the only solution to today\u2019s global debt problem. Some inflation would reduce the real value of the accumulated debt.</p> <p>All this considered, the question is how much money should be created and spent?

July is usually the second highest month for receipts during the financial year, reflecting the timing of corporation tax and self-assessment (SA) payments.<br></p> <p>2) The underlying reason for the slightly smaller surplus than last year was that the 2.2 per cent growth in central government accrued receipts (excluding APF transfers) was slower than the 4.2 per cent growth in central government spending (excluding grants to local authorities). <strong>The rise in central government spending mostly reflected growth in departmental spending</strong>. Growth in central government receipts was depressed by weak income tax receipts, although this partly reflects timing effects as the first self-assessment (SA) payment deadline fell on a weekend this year.<br></p> <p>3) <strong>Meeting our March <em>EFO</em> forecast for PSNB in 2016-17 would require it to fall by \u00a319.8 billion over the full financial year. A third of the way through the financial year, PSNB was only \u00a33.0 billion lower than last year.</strong> While prospects for the rest of the year are subject to greater uncertainty than usual due to the result of the EU referendum, it is still worth noting that receipts and spending data are volatile from month to month and prone to revision, especially at this relatively early stage of the year.<br></p> <p>4) <strong>However, despite these timing effects, there is still evidence that growth in PAYE, NICs and stamp duty land tax (SDLT) was slower in the first four months of the year than would be required to meet our March forecast for the year as a whole.</strong> July\u2019s data cover the first full month since the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU, but a very substantial proportion of the data in this month\u2019s release is either a forecast or still reflects economic activity prior to the referendum.

That would indicate that the economy was motoring along pretty well.</p> <p>A poor reading, though, might reignite concerns that growth is slowing - despite the moderate price pressures, low unemployment and strong consumer spending reported this week.</p> <p>And a quick truffle through this morning\u2019s research notes show that analysts are a little concerned.</p> <p>Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics expects to be underwhelmed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first post-referendum set of public borrowing figures look set to be disappointing. We have pencilled in a surplus of \u00a31bn in July, marginally lower than a year ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>And the team at <strong>RBS Capital Markets</strong> fears Britain may actually have run up a deficit in July:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>July is seasonally a good month for tax receipts with a second wave of self-assessment tax payments, quarterly corporation tax instalments and the first of three payments through the year by oil and gas firms.</p> <p>The OBR has said it planned for modest tax receipts from those oil and gas companies on the back of weak commodity prices. Our simple arithmetic process points to a surplus on the government budget of \u00a31bn for July, but in light of modest expectations for those tax receipts and poor outturns in earlier months of this financial year the risk is for a smaller surplus or possibly even a deficit.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>There\u2019s not much else on the agenda today, but we\u2019ll keep an eye on the oil price, and a nasty economic crisis unfolding in Mongolia (more on that shortly....)</strong></p> <p>And in the absence of much news, European stock markets are expected to be pretty flat...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/766507194783105024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our European opening calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag\">$FTSE</a> 6860 down 9<br>$DAX\u00a010590 down 13<br>$CAC\u00a04429 down 8<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag\">$IBEX</a> 8527 down 23<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIB&amp;src=ctag\">$MIB</a> 16657 down 17</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/766507194783105024\">August 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T07:01:46.161Z\">at 8.01am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "The dramatic slide in sterling since the Brexit vote has given British holidaymakers enough pain already. But there was a further shock in store this week after some airports offered less than \u20ac1 to \u00a31 at two major airports. At Stansted and Luton, travellers found they could not even exchange \u00a31 for \u20ac1, which at least prepared them for the financial squeeze at their destinations. Those holidaying in Europe are finding that meals, coffees, drinks and other items are typically at least 22% more expensive than a year ago. There has, however, been a benefit for the British economy. On Thursday, official data showed that retail sales leapt 1.4% in July following a drop in June \u2013 apparently helped by an influx of big-spending overseas tourists from the likes of the US, China and Hong Kong. Here are some of the consequences of the pound\u2019s slump against the euro. Foreign visitors to the UK It\u2019s not just London experiencing a surge in visitors exploiting the cheap pound, according to Ryanair. It said there had been a surge in \u201cclose-in bookings\u201d \u2013 those made six weeks before flying \u2013 from southern European travellers heading to Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Scotland, as well as the capital. \u201cFor so long it has been, \u2018I love going to London but it\u2019s so expensive.\u2019 Now it\u2019s so much cheaper, we\u2019ve seen a big increase in short-term bookings to London and regional UK,\u201d said Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer. However, Ryanair\u2019s biggest increase in business has come from Americans and Chinese flying to Europe and then using its network to come to Britain and shop. \u201cWe are carrying 20% more Americans this summer, and have seen a 10% increase in the number of Chinese coming into places such as Rome and Berlin, then using Ryanair to get around Europe. It is absolutely linked to the weakness of sterling.\u201d According to this week\u2019s official retail sales data, purchases of watches and jewellery were up 16.6% on the year, a rise largely attributed to foreign buyers. For European and Chinese visitors, prices in British stores are now roughly 18% and 13% below mid-August 2015. For Americans it is around 16%, while for Australians everything is now a fifth cheaper. Meanwhile, CAISSA Touristic, one of China\u2019s leading tour operators, said that over the past two months it had seen a 20% increase in inquiries and bookings involving travel to the UK. British tourists abroad The weak pound has added hundreds of pounds to the cost of many people\u2019s summer holidays. According to M&amp;S Bank, the typical cost of a one-week overseas summer holiday for a family of four, including flights, accommodation, meals and spending money, had risen by \u00a3429 compared to last year due to the fall in sterling. In Sorrento in southern Italy, the typical cost of a three-course evening meal for a British family of four, including a bottle of wine and soft drinks, has effectively risen by 22% in a year, with the bill around \u00a386 this year compared with just under \u00a371 a year ago, based on recent exchange rates. Corfu in Greece has recorded a similar percentage rise \u2013 from around \u00a342 to \u00a352. Meanwhile, the typical cost of a glass of wine in a Sorrento bar has effectively leapt 53% in a year, from \u00a31.41 (\u20ac2) in August 2015 to \u00a32.16 (\u20ac2.50). These figures were provided by Post Office Travel Money, which publishes an annual family holiday report. It said bars and restaurants in several of the resorts surveyed had cut their prices to attract tourists. The staycation Are the British swapping the Balearic Islands for the Isle of Wight? According to tourist authorities on the Isle of Wight, there has been a \u201cvery significant leap\u201d in its website traffic, while Visit East Anglia said its enquiries had risen by a quarter. But talk of a staycation boom may be premature. Ryanair said that it carried a record number of British holidaymakers to Europe in July, the first full month after the referendum. \u201cYou are still getting a pint of lager for \u00a31 in parts of Spain and Portugal, while you\u2019ll struggle to find it anywhere under \u00a32.50 in Britain,\u201d said Jacobs at Ryanair. \u201cWhen people like Nigel Farage say that Brexit will encourage Brits to holiday at home, he\u2019s talking absolute nonsense. Since Brexit we\u2019ve not seen any drop-off in business. If money is tight next year, people won\u2019t stop going on holiday abroad \u2013 they will more likely drop down from a four-star hotel to a three-star.\u201d This may already be happening: the website TravelSupermarket said it was seeing a lot of interest in last-minute summer sun package holidays, particularly in the \u00a3300-\u00a3400 per person per week bracket. \u201cWe\u2019re currently seeing all-inclusive four-star holidays to Turkey in early September for as little as \u00a3230 per person,\u201d it added. Bureaux de change Researchers from currency specialist Caxton FX found that the Moneycorp exchange booth at Stansted airport was at one point offering just \u20ac0.9915 for each \u00a31 exchanged. The rate on offer at the ICE (International Currency Exchange) bureaux de change at Luton airport was even lower at \u20ac0.9900. One recent survey suggested that holidaymakers travelling to Europe can expect to be around 7% better-off if they sort out their euros in advance rather than buying them at the airport. But checks carried out by the Guardian suggest the figure could be double that in some cases. Northern Ireland Northern Ireland, which voted to stay in the EU, has at least benefited from the post-Brexit plunge in the pound. At the Quays shopping centre in Newry, just four miles from the border with the Republic, the fall in the pound is a huge relief following several tough years after the Irish economy tanked. This week, a sizeable proportion of the vehicles in its car park belonged to bargain-hunting shoppers up from the south. Cathal Austin, the manager at Quays, said: \u201cWe have seen an increase since the pound has fallen, and we are expecting a much bigger increase for Halloween and Christmas.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Post Office is facing potential strike action as unions try to fight privatisation and cuts to jobs and pension benefits. More than 80% of those who voted in a ballot by the Communication Workers Union this week backed strike action, but only 50.3% of the union\u2019s 3,500 members who work for the Post Office took part. The CWU is yet to set a timetable for any strikes, and is calling on the government to intervene because the service is on a \u201cpath to extinction\u201d. Unite, which represents Post Office supervisors and managers, will also ballot members on strike action on 5 September. It has also urged the government to investigate the service\u2019s financial difficulties. It remains publicly owned after the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail postal service in 2013. Dave Ward, the CWU\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThe government has to step in, convene a summit of key stakeholders and hammer out with us and the board a strategy that will give the Post Office a future. \u201cIt cannot wash its hands of this and simply stand by as a national institution goes under. Just as we have seen with Tata Steel, this is another clear example of the government having no plan whatsoever to stand up for British industry.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s government, however, appears unwilling to get involved. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cThis is an operational matter for Post Office Ltd. As its annual accounts show, there has been a continuing improvement in Post Office\u2019s financial performance, and a reduced reliance on taxpayer support. \u201cOur investment has led to the most stable network for decades, 200,000 extra opening hours a week and more than 3,500 branches open on Sundays.\u201d The Post Office said that only 41% of the CWU\u2019s membership had voted for strike action. It said it was happy to talk to the union but intended to continue its modernisation programme. A statement from the Post Office made clear that any industrial action would not involve people working in more than 97% of the its 11,600-plus branches, and that it already had contingency plans to minimise disruption to services. Kevin Gilliland, the Post Office\u2019s network and sales director said: \u201cWe must continue with our plans to modernise our network and make it better for customers. We are taking the right actions to ensure that Post Office branches thrive for future generations. \u201cWe halved our losses in 2015/16 and are making steady progress in ensuring our business is simpler to run, reducing costs to the taxpayer whilst at the same time modernising our network.\u201d The strike vote comes as about 3,500 workers face a cut in pension benefits as the Post Office tries to cut costs. About half of its 7,000-strong workforce is being forced to shift from a final salary pension scheme to a defined contribution scheme, a move that unions say could cut retirement benefits by 30% or even more in some cases. The planned pension cuts were announced just days after the Post Office said it would be looking to put 20 more Crown offices into private hands, taking the total this year to 85 in a process opposed by unions who see it as a form of backdoor privatisation. The Post Office was already facing criticism after it agreed to hand over up to 61 branches to WH Smith in April, including some of the 39 Crown offices flagged up to be put into private hands in January. Before that, 50 Crown offices, which the Post Office runs directly, had been franchised or otherwise offloaded since 2013. The Royal Mail is also facing a battle with its 140,000 workers after unions threatened a campaign of action against plans to cut pension benefits.",

It said it was happy to talk to the union but intended to continue its modernisation programme.</p> <p>A statement from the Post Office made clear that any industrial action would not involve people working in more than 97% of the its 11,600-plus branches, and that it already had contingency plans to minimise disruption to services.</p> <p>Kevin Gilliland, the Post Office\u2019s network and sales director said: \u201cWe must continue with our plans to modernise our network and make it better for customers. We are taking the right actions to ensure that Post Office branches thrive for future generations.</p> <p>\u201cWe halved our losses in 2015/16 and are making steady progress in ensuring our business is simpler to run, reducing costs to the taxpayer whilst at the same time modernising our network.\u201d</p> <p>The strike vote comes as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/post-office-pension-benefits-cut-defined-contribution\">about 3,500 workers face a cut in pension benefits</a> as the Post Office tries to cut costs.</p> <p>About half of its 7,000-strong workforce is being forced to shift from a final salary pension scheme to a defined contribution scheme, a move that unions say could cut retirement benefits by 30% or even more in some cases.</p> <p>The planned pension cuts were announced just days after the Post Office said it would be looking to <a href=\"http://corporate.postoffice.co.uk/our-media-centre#/pressreleases/update-on-post-office-plans-for-its-crown-branch-network-1467065\">put 20 more Crown offices into private hands</a>, taking the total this year to 85 in a process opposed by unions who see it as a form of backdoor privatisation. </p> <p>The Post Office was already facing criticism after it agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/post-office-to-move-up-to-61-branches-to-wh-smith\">hand over up to 61 branches to WH Smith in April</a>, including some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/post-office-jobs-under-threat-as-39-branches-set-for-privatisation\">39 Crown offices flagged up</a> to be put into private hands in January.

In a note to clients, Pensions and Investment Research Consultants (Pirc) said under Hellawell\u2019s leadership Sports Direct\u2019s board had \u201cconsistently failed to address the employment practices issues raised by some shareholders and trade unions that have also been criticised by a parliamentary select committee report\u201d. Sports Direct will hold its annual general meeting on 7 September at its headquarters at Shirebrook in Derbyshire. The complex also includes the giant warehouse where the Guardian exposed treatment of employees that MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee compared to conditions at a Victorian workhouse. Leading shareholders are considering voting against board members in an attempt to force change after long-running concerns about how the company is run. Under rules introduced last year, companies with a dominant shareholder such as Ashley, who owns 55% of Sports Direct, need the approval of independent shareholders in a separate vote at annual meetings. Pirc, which advises clients with assets of more than \u00a3200bn, said Hellawell had not shown leadership and that the board did not appear to function effectively. \u201cIt is important for the shareholders to be confident about the board\u2019s ability to represent its best interests. This is no longer the case with the existing chairman and an oppose vote is therefore recommended,\u201d Pirc said. If independent shareholders vote to oust Hellawell, Sports Direct can hold another vote of all shareholders between 90 and 120 days after the AGM. Pirc advised shareholders to vote against Ashley, who is executive deputy chairman, because of concerns about his influence on the board. It also cited the judgment of MPs that Ashley should be held accountable for working practices at Sports Direct. Shareholders should also oppose the company\u2019s annual report because of \u201csignificant and recurrent employment and governance concerns\u201d, Pirc said. It recommended voting for the pay report after Dave Forsey, the chief executive, waived a bonus worth up to \u00a34m. Pirc recommended support for the Unite union\u2019s resolution calling for an independent review of working practices, which is opposed by Sports Direct\u2019s board. On Thursday, Sports Direct said it would publish a report on working practices, compiled by its law firm RPC, before the AGM and conduct a review of its board of directors before next April. A shareholder in Sports Direct said the statement was unlikely to change the minds of unhappy investors. \u201cThey were clearly putting quite a lot of store by the announcement but I think it\u2019s landed quite flat with shareholders.\u201d Sports Direct did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "bodyText": "The government achieved a smaller than expected surplus on the public finances in July, leaving the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, with a tougher balancing act to buoy the post-referendum economy while also bringing down Britain\u2019s deficit. In the month following the Brexit vote, the government achieved a surplus of \u00a31bn as it earned more in tax income than it spent in a month that is typically lucrative for the public coffers because businesses settle their tax bills. That was lower than a \u00a31.2bn surplus in the same month last year and below economists\u2019 forecasts of\u00a31.6bn in a Reuters poll. Economists said the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics were disappointing, and warned the Brexit vote was likely to deal a bigger blow to public finances in the coming months and years. \u201cSlightly disappointing news for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as the public finances could only eke out a small surplus in July,\u201d said Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight. \u201cThe public finances look poised to take a serious hit from probable significantly weakened economic activity after the Brexit vote taking a toll on tax receipts in particular. It also seems probable that unemployment will rise while any slowdown in the housing market will hit stamp duty receipts.\u201d Samuel Tombs, of the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the \u201cunderwhelming surplus leaves the chancellor with little wiggle room\u201d. \u201cJuly\u2019s relatively small surplus means that the chancellor will be able to put together only a modest package of measures to support the economy in the autumn statement later this year,\u201d he said. But others noted the chancellor\u2019s recent indications that he will not be wedded to near-term targets to get the public finances into a surplus - where the government takes in more than it spends in a year - when the economy is likely to need extra help in the wake of the Brexit vote. As such, comparisons against earlier borrowing targets and previous forecasts from the fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, were of limited value, said economists Victoria Clarke and Chris Hare at the bank Investec. \u201cWe expect the autumn statement to move the Treasury on to a looser path to bringing the UK deficit back to surplus, with some action taken to provide a foot up to the economy post-EU vote, including some additional investment spending,\u201d they added. The July figures showed the surplus was driven by a rise in tax receipts, which were up 3.4% compared with a year earlier, at \u00a361.8bn. Corporation tax receipts rose 8.4% to \u00a37.5bn, while income tax payments rose by 1.9% to \u00a318.9bn. Central government spending rose by 1.4%, at \u00a358.4bn. In the current fiscal year starting in April, the government has borrowed \u00a323.7bn, \u00a33bn lower than at the same point last year. In the year ending March 2016, when George Osborne was chancellor, the deficit was \u00a375.3bn, \u00a316.5bn lower than the year before. David Gauke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cWith the public finances in surplus in July, our economy starts from a position of strength to face any economic turbulence following the vote to leave the EU. \u201cAs we keep working to cut the deficit, we are well-placed to handle any challenges and seize the opportunities as our economy adjusts.\u201d The ONS cautioned that the picture was not entirely clear because it was still collecting data for July. \u201cEstimates for the latest period always contain a substantial forecast element and so any post-referendum impact may not become clear for some time.\u201d The Office for Budget Responsibility \u2013 the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster \u2013 is likely to revise its forecasts for government borrowing at the time of the autumn statement later this year, taking into account the impact of the Brexit vote. At the time of the March budget, the OBR was forecasting a full-year deficit of \u00a355.5bn. Commenting on the July figures, the OBR noted there was still \u201clittle firm evidence\u201d on how the referendum result might affect the public finances this year. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, a business lobby group, said fixing the public finances by further reducing the deficit would be \u201can increasingly uphill task\u201d if economic growth slowed in the coming months.",

      "bodyText": "William Hill shares are in demand as investors bet that the bookmaker\u2019s future is bright following the collapse of a joint approach from Rank and 888, whether on its own or as a continuing takeover target. The Rank/888 consortium said on Thursday it would not make an offer following a rejection by William Hill\u2019s board, prompting the bookmaker to announce after the market closed that it expected full year profits to be at the top end of expectations. The news prompted postive comment from analysts, helping send William Hill shares 9.3p higher to 312.4p. Liberum said: As we and the market expected, 888/Rank has failed in its proposal to create a three-way merger with William Hill. However, the gaming industry is demonstrating through a whole series of M&amp;A transactions that smashing these businesses together can create major synergy benefits and generate value for shareholders. In light of this, the status quo at Hills is certainly under threat and in the short term, there could be a value opportunity given the depressed share price. Meanwhile we edge up our target price to 323p (was 319p) as William Hill guides towards the top end of the range for 2016 EBIT. In a buy note Deutsche Bank said: We had argued that either a bid would transpire or that William Hill was undervalued. Either way we saw attractive upside potential to William Hill shares: please see our note: William Hill: Betting in play. We now focus on the stand-alone William Hill. We see several areas of downside protection but attractive upside potential. Includes: 1) The pre-approach share price was around 315p, or around 265p prior to the departure of the former chief executive; 2) William Hill has strong valuation support with around 4% dividend yield and around 8% free cash flow yield; 3) the company has now re- confirmed that trading for the full year is expected to be at the top end of guidance \u00a3260-280m; 4) numbers should be further underpinned by newly identified cost synergies (not quantified); 5) the online gaming markets are consolidating so any missteps could revive M&amp;A discussion/action, in our view. To have rejected an offer around 40% higher than the current share price, we argue that William Hill must be comfortable with the underlying progress of the company. As we anticipated, William Hill has re-comforted the market on numbers, and online progress. The suspended share buyback programme (\u00a360m so far out of \u00a3200m target) may provide further support. We await news on a chief executive, with a suitable candidate possibly adding a further catalyst. At Stifel, analyst Jeffrey Harwood stuck with his hold recommendation: The decision by 888 and Rank not to proceed with a complex and unusual offer is not a surprise to us. Our view was a three-way transaction would be difficult to consummate for obvious reasons, particularly given the nature of the proposal and the lack of enthusiasm shown by William Hill for the transaction. Following its rejection of the approach from 888 and Rank and its underperformance in the last year, we look to William Hill to execute the turnaround at William Hill Online and to recruit a new chief executive. We believe the shares have recovery potential if the turnaround can be successfully executed. Our preference is for more focus on improving the existing operations as opposed to international expansion through acquisition. History shows that it is difficult for UK gaming companies to expand internationally and Hills\u2019 experience in Australia demonstrates this.",

    "webTitle": "Boom or gloom? The economic verdict on Brexit \u2026 so far", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There were warnings of recession before the EU referendum and more such gloomy forecasts have followed the vote to leave. But after a week of official economic data \u2013 including inflation and unemployment \u2013 gave a clearer impact of the immediate consequences of the poll, what do the numbers so far tell us? Employment is up, shoppers kept spending and a weaker pound has boosted UK tourism. At the same time, inflation has picked up, house prices have wobbled and businesses say they are nervous about hiring and investing. Here is what we have learned from the data: Monthly jobs data can be volatile, but fears that a Brexit vote would trigger widespread job losses were not realised in July. Official figures this week showed that the number of people claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance actually fell in the month following the referendum, the first such drop since February. The data also showed the employment rate was at a record high in the run-up to the vote, standing at 74.5% for the three months to June. Business surveys have suggested some firms are reluctant to hire new workers since the vote and some reports have pointed to jobs being cut. But if the last recession is anything to go by, employers will be reluctant to part with skilled workers before they have a clearer idea of the business climate. Still, the Bank of England is predicting 250,000 job losses and believes the unemployment rate will rise from 4.9% now to 5.6% in two years\u2019 time. Inflation rose to the highest level in 20 months in July but at 0.6% remained relatively low and well below the Bank of England target for 2%. Economists are warning of steeper prices rises in the coming months as the full impact of the weaker pound following the Brexit vote is felt. The drop in the UK currency makes imports more expensive and retailers and manufacturers will probably pass on those higher costs to end consumers. The Bank of England predicts inflation will stand at 2.4% in two years\u2019 time. Hot on the heels of the solid jobs numbers this week, came news of a bounce in high street sales. Warm weather trumped Brexit fears, it seemed, as shoppers splashed out on sandals and summer tops. Official figures showed retail sales volumes rose by 1.4% in July after a 0.9% drop in June. That was much stronger than the 0.2% increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll but echoed industry reports of solid growth in consumer spending last month. There was also a boost to sales from tourists coming over to snap up luxury goods such as watches, made cheaper by the weak pound. Some commentators warn that job cuts will start to bite later this year and spending will then fall. But for now, a relatively stable housing market, low inflation, low interest rates and low unemployment are keeping the tills ringing. Analysts had predicted a drop in house prices following the Brexit vote. So far the early signs have been mixed but nothing points to dramatic falls. Lender Halifax said house prices fell 1% in July. But on a less volatile three-month basis they continued to grow. Figures from its rival Nationwide showed prices rising 0.5% in July. But the building society warned that any impact from the vote might not be fully evident in July\u2019s figures. A survey of estate agents by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) suggested sales and demand from homebuyers dipped in July. But the group expected activity to settle in coming months and surveyors were feeling more positive about prices over coming months and the year ahead. That is reassuring news for homeowners, says Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at the bank Berenberg. \u201cTentatively, data on market expectations improved between June and July, suggesting that the Brexit bark might have been worse than the bite. There\u2019s little evidence yet that points to a Lehman re-run in the UK housing market.\u201d The British public\u2019s confidence in the economy recovered in August, according to a survey from data company Markit. The rebound in sentiment followed a slump in July as consumers fretted about the impact that leaving the EU would have on disposable incomes. Expectations for finances over the next 12 months picked up to 49.8 on the Markit household finances index in August, from 47.1 in July. Anything below 50 signals deterioration, so households believe the outlook is stable, though they are still feeling cautious. Other measures of consumer confidence also signalled a sharp initial drop in July. But data on consumer spending suggested people were still shopping, eating out and going to the cinema. The public finances were in surplus a month after the Brexit vote as the government earned more in tax income than it spent, but the performance was weaker than expected. Stronger corporation tax receipts contributed to a \u00a31bn surplus this July, according to the Office for National Statistics. But that was lower than a \u00a31.2bn surplus in the same month last year and below economists forecasts for \u00a31.6bn in a Reuters poll. Overall, as this chart shows, for the financial year so far the deficit is smaller than in the previous year. July is typically a strong month for the public finances, with companies settling their corporation tax bills and self-employed people paying their income tax. Economists said it was not yet clear what impact the Brexit vote would have on the public finances over the coming months and years. The ONS itself cautioned: \u201cEstimates for the latest period always contain a substantial forecast element and so any post-referendum impact may not become clear for some time.\u201d Sterling tumbled against the euro and the US dollar in the wake of the referendum result. That could make life easier for exporters, by making their goods cheaper to overseas buyers. However, it raises import costs. For UK holidaymakers, the weaker pound has added to the cost of their summer break and they are finding that \u00a31 buys less than a euro at some airports\u2019 bureaux de change. In the week that sterling slipped to a new three-year low against the euro following the Brexit vote, researchers found that bureaux de change at Stansted and Luton airports were offering just 99 cents for every pound exchanged. At one point on Tuesday, \u00a31 was worth just \u20ac1.1476, its lowest level since August 2013. Sterling has since rallied a little, with \u00a31 buying \u20ac1.1595 on Friday. That compares with \u20ac1.30 the day before the referendum in June, and \u20ac1.42 in August 2015. The FTSE 100 share index hit a 14-month peak of 6,941.19 earlier this week and is not far off setting a new all-time high. Action from the Bank of England to shore up the economy and its promise of more to come has helped. There has also been a boost from the weaker pound to those FTSE big hitters that earn a substantial amount of sales from overseas. The drop in sterling flatters the finances of companies that report profits in dollars and it helps exporters. It also makes the pound-denominated share index cheaper to buy into for foreign investors. We won\u2019t get the official take on post-referendum GDP growth until October. But early surveys of the construction, manufacturing and services sectors, point to the economy shrinking in the third quarter, say their compilers. There was a record fall in the all-sector purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) in July, which was published earlier in the month. Markit\u2019s chief economist Chris Williamson said that pointed to a 0.4% drop in GDP in the July-to-September quarter, a stark contrast to growth of 0.6% in the previous three months. Technically, a recession is two consecutive quarters of contraction. For now, the Bank of England is cautiously optimistic that will be avoided after it stepped in with more electronic money creation and a cut in interest rates to a record low. Signs since then that consumer spending, the main driver of UK growth, is holding up will bolster those tentative hopes.",

    "webTitle": "Frog Bikes bring manufacturing back home to beat the business cycle", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers were only just recovering from the last downturn when the Brexit vote dealt a fresh blow to confidence, and the early signs are that the mere prospect of leaving the EU has hit demand for goods rolling off British production lines. Brave timing then for anyone to open a new factory, but that is just what a small British bike manufacturer has done. From this month, brightly coloured children\u2019s Frog Bikes destined for stores around the UK and the rest of the world will be painstakingly assembled from 120 parts, packed up and shipped out from a brand new factory in Pontypool, south Wales. Until now, the bikes have been assembled in China using components from around the world. Now the company is \u201creshoring\u201d, following the lead of other manufacturers in moving the bulk of their production back to the UK to get better control over lead times and quality. The Pontypool factory will employ as many as 50 workers and can make 200 bikes a day at full tilt. Frog Bikes employs a further 25 at its head office near Windsor. Jerry Lawson, who started the business with his wife Shelley in 2013, says there were times last year when it could not keep up with demand and he hopes having production in the UK will address that. \u201cWhat we have found since we started is we are bad at forecasting and end up out of stock,\u201d he says, standing outside the new plant on a sprawling industrial estate set among gently rolling hills. \u201cThis will enable us to be more responsive to the market, have more control over quality, introduce innovations faster, reduce our environmental footprint and create jobs to benefit the local economy,\u201d he says. The couple, who both have corporate backgrounds, came up with the idea for lightweight children\u2019s bikes when teaching theirs to ride. They felt the bikes on the market were poorly designed for children and in some cases heavier than Jerry\u2019s adult bike. So they worked with Brunel University sports scientists and a Team GB Olympic bike designer to create lighter children\u2019s frames. The designs quickly proved popular with parents and are now sold in 900 independent bike stores in the UK and 30 countries overseas. Turnover has doubled every year and the business turned a profit from its second year. Britain\u2019s cycling success at the Olympic Games may provide a further fillip for the home market. One of the British cyclists to win gold in Rio was Joanna Rowsell-Shand, who is a brand ambassador for Frog Bikes. At the same time, the referendum result brings the risk of recession and a blow to sales. \u201cIn terms of Brexit we haven\u2019t seen a drop in consumer confidence yet,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cBut I think we will see a little bit of a softening in demand, if consumer confidence does dip. A kids bike, a good kids bike, is a luxury item for most households.\u201d The factory was planned long before the referendum was called and was supported by the Welsh government in return for plans to create new jobs. But now economists are predicting tough times ahead for manufacturers. \u201cI still do think it\u2019s the right thing to do from an operational and environmental point of view, but it will be a longer payback than we planned,\u201d says Shelley. Economists say the Brexit vote will tip the UK into recession at worst or, cause a protracted period of uncertainty and subdued spending at best. But experts also highlight a potential boost to manufacturing from the fall in the value of the pound since the vote, which has made UK goods cheaper in overseas markets. The change of government has also brought hope of a renewed focus on an industrial strategy for Britain. In the near term, signs of a blow to confidence and activity from the Brexit vote are worrying for a sector that has yet to fully recover from the last downturn. Manufacturing, which accounts for a tenth of the UK economy, had been picking up in the months before the referendum, but surveys since suggest demand is down and jobs are being cut. A weak pound has boosted exports, but at the same time it has raised costs for manufacturers that use imported materials. For Frog Bikes, it has raised costs because it buys most of its component parts, such as brakes and frames, in US dollars. \u201cThe dollar dropping 14% means everything goes up 14%,\u201d says Jerry. Lee Hopley, the chief economist at the manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF, says there is a clear \u201cbefore-and-after story\u201d for manufacturing. \u201cPre-referendum, our narrative was that we thought that manufacturing was turning a corner. Many of the drags from 2015 were beginning to ebb, especially the low oil price \u2026 there were signs of recovering demand in big European markets,\u201d she says. \u201cNow the outlook is just a lot more uncertain. What we know is that confidence has taken a hit. What is less clear is how persistent that will be.\u201d Hopley expects to see significant variation between sub-sectors of manufacturing, with the weaker sub-sectors forecast to overshadow pockets of strength. \u201cWe see modest growth across the sector as a whole this year but virtually all of that will have taken place in the first half. We had been expecting growth in 2017 and we are not at all confident about that now,\u201d she says. That gloomy outlook will put pressure on Theresa May\u2019s government to show it is serious about boosting manufacturing. After the former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s call for a \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d failed to get manufacturing back to its pre-crisis strength, May has sought to reassure business leaders her cabinet will do more. There was widespread support for the prime minister\u2019s move to merge the government\u2019s business and energy departments and add the phrase \u201cindustrial strategy\u201d to the title. The Lawsons are hoping for a change of direction. They were dismayed when Osborne scrapped the state-funded Business Growth Service in last November\u2019s spending review. Its advisors had helped the couple access finance to expand and apply for grants. Without the service, they would not have set up the Pontypool factory, they say. Frog Bikes now gets help from a mentor provided by the Welsh government, and Shelley would like to see something similar across the UK. \u201cIf you think of the number of jobs we have been able to create given the very modest investment that was required \u2026 it\u2019s an incredibly efficient way to kickstart the economy at the small-business level.\u201d The Welsh government will be hoping the new bike factory helps reinforce its post-referendum message that Wales is open for business. Wales depends on manufacturing for jobs more heavily than the UK as a whole. The sector accounts for 11.3% of jobs in Wales compared with 7.8% across the UK. The Welsh government has been working to increase jobs by attracting new investors. In February, it managed to beat off competition from around the world to secure a deal with Aston Martin for a new factory, creating 750 jobs. At Frog Bikes, one of the Welsh factory\u2019s newest employees, 26-year-old Neal Brookfield, is hopeful tthe plant and other moves to reshore manufacturing will create more secure work for his generation. \u201cIt\u2019s common knowledge that times are tough for finding jobs for young people, and more so in Wales,\u201d he says. Since he started at the bike factory in July, friends have been calling to ask if he can get them work there. \u201cThe difference with this job is it\u2019s permanent \u2026 the fact that they couldn\u2019t keep up with demand last year suggests there is a good future for the business.\u201d",

From this month, <a href=\"https://www.frogbikes.com/\">brightly coloured children\u2019s Frog Bikes</a> destined for stores around the UK and the rest of the world will be painstakingly assembled from 120 parts, packed up and shipped out from a brand new factory in Pontypool, south Wales. </p> <p>Until now, the bikes have been assembled in China using components from around the world. Now the company is \u201creshoring\u201d, following the lead of other manufacturers in moving the bulk of their production back to the UK to get better control over lead times and quality. </p> <p>The Pontypool factory will employ as many as 50 workers and can make 200 bikes a day at full tilt. Frog Bikes employs a further 25 at its head office near Windsor. </p> <p>Jerry Lawson, who started the business with his wife Shelley in 2013, says there were times last year when it could not keep up with demand and he hopes having production in the UK will address that.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10804c23d624fc577d4cf99bd1ea756f4fd1d1fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10804c23d624fc577d4cf99bd1ea756f4fd1d1fd/0_65_5259_3407/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker constucts a Frog Bike\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The factory was supported by the Welsh government in return for plans to create new jobs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat we have found since we started is we are bad at forecasting and end up out of stock,\u201d he says, standing outside the new plant on a sprawling industrial estate set among gently rolling hills.</p> <p>\u201cThis will enable us to be more responsive to the market, have more control over quality, introduce innovations faster, reduce our environmental footprint and create jobs to benefit the local economy,\u201d he says. </p> <p>The couple, who both have corporate backgrounds, came up with the idea for lightweight children\u2019s bikes when teaching theirs to ride. They felt the bikes on the market were poorly designed for children and in some cases heavier than Jerry\u2019s adult bike. So they worked with Brunel University sports scientists and a Team GB Olympic bike designer to create lighter children\u2019s frames.</p> <p>The designs quickly proved popular with parents and are now sold in 900 independent bike stores in the UK and 30 countries overseas. Turnover has doubled every year and the business turned a profit from its second year.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s cycling success at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games\">Olympic Games</a> may provide a further fillip for the home market. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/britain-women-gold-olympic-team-pursuit-rio-2016\">One of the British cyclists to win gold in Rio was Joanna Rowsell-Shand</a>, who is a brand ambassador for Frog Bikes.
