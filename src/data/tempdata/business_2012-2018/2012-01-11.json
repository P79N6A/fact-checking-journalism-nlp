The huge payday for the firm, which claims presidents and prime ministers among its advisers, comes as the private equity industry has fallen under intense scrutiny over the course of the race for the Republican nomination.

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury's, SuperGroup and Greggs emerged as the winners on Wednesday from a brutal Christmas holiday season for the retail industry. Britain's third largest grocer was the surprise victor in the supermarket wars: although its stores usually do well at Christmas, the national mood of belt-tightening was expected to hold it back. But Justin King, chief executive, said Sainsbury's had prospered, as shoppers apparently scrimped in October and November to fund a blowout in December: \"Customers took the opportunity to spend a little less, week in week out, so they could buy the best for special occasions.\" In a sign of the pressure on household budgets, Sainsbury's said shoppers cashed in a record \u00a3100m of its Nectar reward points to pay for extras such as champagne and cherry-filled Christmas puddings. Sales of its premium Taste the Difference range were up 10% but sales of its low-price Basics range also rose strongly, as did cooking ingredients, suggesting shoppers were making economies elsewhere \u2013 possibly even baking their own Christmas cakes, with sales of unsalted butter and dried fruit up 82% and 30% respectively. Like-for-like sales at Sainsbury's were up 1.2% excluding VAT in the 14 weeks to 7 January \u2013 better than the 0.7% rise from Morrisons and what is expected to be the worst Christmas performance from Tesco in decades when it updates the City on Thursday morning. December data from Kantar Worldpanel showed Sainsbury's market share at 16.7%, its highest since 2003. \"This provides further evidence that the winners this Christmas have been those brands with the ability to fulfil the UK's demand to treat itself on special occasions,\" said Oriel Securities analyst Jonathan Pritchard. The downturn has led to an enforced consumer austerity drive: Home shopping group N Brown, whose catalogues include Simply Be and Jacamo, worried investors on Thursday by warning profit margins had been squeezed by discounting and of a rise in the number of bad debtors, sending its shares down more than 5% to 229.8p. However, baker Greggs struck gold at Christmas as flagging shoppers ducked in to refuel on one of its 30p mince pies. The chain, which now has more British outlets than McDonald's, sold 7.7m mince pies over the festive season. \"Our great strength for value hit a chord again for consumers,\" said its chief executive Ken McMeikan. Like-for-like sales jumped from the 0.8% seen in the third quarter to 5.1% in the five weeks to 7 January, although McMeikan expects growth to be more subdued in 2012. SuperGroup, the company behind the Superdry fashion brand, also ended a difficult year on a high note with like-for-likes ahead more than 9% in December. Best known for its hoodies, logo T-shirts and neon-check shirts, Superdry issued a profit warning in October after an IT glitch at its warehouse affected stock deliveries to stores. Unlike many rivals, it did not cut its prices before Christmas and chief executive Julian Dunkerton said the strong performance should quiet doubters who have suggested Superdry is getting overexposed. \"This has put the nail in the brand conversation,\" he said.",

At an appearance before MPson Thursday, George Osborne said he would take a \"keen interest\" in RBS bonuses but made it clear that he could not prevent some of this year's payouts. \"I would certainly expect to have many conversations with the RBS management about the bonuses which they may or may not wish to pay,\" Osborne told the Treasury select committee of MPs. \"Of course, my hands are tied on the bonus arrangements agreed by the previous government but when it comes to the new bonus arrangements you can be sure that this chancellor will be taking a keen interest,\" he said.

The governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, said in December that banks should bolster their capital before paying out bonuses. \"That advice should be heeded,\" the chancellor said.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A looming hard landing in China will bring the financial and economic crisis of the past five years to a climax in 2012, one of the City of London's leading analysts has warned. Albert Edwards, head of strategy at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and one of the UK's leading \"bears\", said the next 12 months would be the \"final year of pain and disappointment\". Predicting a sharp slowdown in activity in the world's fastest-growing emerging economy, Edwards said: \"There is a likelihood of a China hard landing this year. It is hard to think 2013 and onwards will be any worse than this year if China hard-lands.\" Although China emerged rapidly from the downturn of 2008-09, Edwards said the recovery had been the result of a massive reflationary package by the Chinese government. Beijing, he added, could not afford another big stimulus to offset a weakening of the economy. Falling imports have led to a widening of China's trade surplus, but Edwards said exports were set to slow and a trade deficit was looming. He added that despite the recent run of more upbeat economic news from the United States, the risk of another recession in the world's biggest economy was \"very high\". Growth had slowed to an annual rate of 1.5% in the second and third quarters of 2011, below the \"stall speed\" that historically led to recession. It was unlikely that the economy would muddle through, Edwards said. China has grown by around 10% a year on average over the past two decades, making it the world's second-biggest economy, but the threat of a double-dip recession in the west, coupled with signs of over-heating in the Chinese property market, have caused some analysts to predict severe problems ahead. Edwards's view was supported by the historian Edward Chancellor, who said China's recent economic performance conformed to the pattern of previous manias and bubbles in history. These included an uncritically assumed growth story, easy money and credit expansion, investment booms and the misallocation of capital, and conspicuous consumption. The warning of fresh trouble ahead came as the World Economic Forum said rising youth unemployment, pressure on pensions and a growing gulf between rich and poor were sowing the \"seeds of dystopia\" that were putting at risk the gains from globalisation. In its annual assessment of the outlook for the global economy before its meeting in Davos later this month, the WEF expressed concern at the possibility of economic and social upheaval caused by the inability of the young to find work and the dependency of elderly people on states deeply in debt. \"For the first time in generations, many people no longer believe that their children will grow up to enjoy a higher standard of living than theirs,\" said Lee Howell, the WEF managing director responsible for the report. \"This new malaise is particularly acute in the industrialised countries that historically have been a source of great confidence and bold ideas.\" The survey of 469 global experts identified chronic problems with government finances and severe income inequality as the most prevalent risks over the next decade. \"These risks in tandem threaten global growth as they are drivers of nationalism, populism and protectionism at a time when the world remains vulnerable to systemic financial shocks, as well as possible food and water crises,\" the report said. The study said early hopes that closer global integration would inevitably lead to higher living standards for all were at risk of being dashed by trends that left large numbers of people fearful about the future. \"Individuals are increasingly being asked to bear risks previously assumed by governments and companies to obtain a secure retirement and access to quality healthcare. This report is a wake-up call to both the public and private sectors to come up with constructive ways to realign the expectations of an increasingly anxious global community,\" said John Drzik, chief executive of management consultants the Oliver Wyman Group . The study said the policies and institutions of the 20th century no longer offered protection in a more complex and integrated global economy. \"The weakness of existing safeguards is exposed by risks related to emerging technologies, financial interdependence, resource depletion and climate change, leaving society vulnerable.\" It also warned that there was a \"dark side of connectivity\", with societies vulnerable to \"malicious\" and \"devastating\" cyber attacks. \"The Arab spring demonstrated the power of interconnected communications services to drive personal freedom, yet the same technology facilitated riots in London. Governments, societies and businesses need to better understand the interconnectivity of risk in today's technologies if we are truly to reap the benefits they offer,\" said Steve Wilson, chief risk officer for general insurance at Zurich.",

      "bodyText": "China could be the next country to go bust, if its headlong rush to build ever-taller skyscrapers is a guide to its future economic health. According to a study by Barclays Capital, the mania for skyscrapers over the last 140 years is a sure indicator of an imminent crash. It points out that the construction boom that threw up New York's Chrysler and Empire State buildings preceded the New York crash of 1929 and Great Depression. More recently, Dubai built a forest of skyscraping offices, hotels and apartment buildings, including the world's tallest, the Burj Khalifa, before it got into terrible financial difficulties. In 2010 Dubai had to be bailed out by its neighbour, Abu Dhabi, to avoid going bankrupt. Bar Cap's report said: \"Thankfully for the world economy, there is not currently a skyscraper under construction that is planned to overtake the height of the Burj Khalifa.\" However, BarCap said the \"unhealthy correlation\" between construction of the world's tallest buildings and economic crashes was likely to ensnare China, which is home to half of the world's skyscrapers currently under construction. India, which has just two skyscrapers, sometimes defined as buildings over 240 metres (787ft) tall, is also on the radar after giving the go-ahead to its first skyscraper building boom, with 14 under way, including the world's second-tallest tower in the financial capital, Mumbai. Andrew Lawrence, director of property research at Barclays Capital in Hong Kong, said: \"Building booms are a sign of excess credit.\" Lawrence said that historically, skyscraper construction had been characterised by bursts of sporadic, but intense activity that coincided with easy credit, rising land prices and excessive optimism, but often by the time the buildings were finished, the economy had slipped into recession. China is already showing signs of fulfilling the prophecy. Its largest quarterly business survey showed that confidence among property developers had collapsed to a point where it was worse than the lowest point in the 2008 recession. More worringly, the same survey revealed that confidence among construction firms, while a little down on the previous quarter, remained bouyant. Capital Economics, the independent analysts, said Beijing's decision to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into construction projects, bypassing private developers, has prolonged the building boom and potentially stored up a bigger crash. Even funds pouring into residential schemes are at risk following years of high-rise developments near factories and businesses dependent on the west for trade. A recession in Europe that drags the rest of the world into a period of lower growth will hurt Chinese exporters, jobs and demand for property. BarCap said signs of trouble were escalating in China and India. China had the dubious distinction of being the world's \"biggest bubble builder,\" as it erected ever more and higher towers, it said. Home to 53% of the 124 skyscrapers now under construction globally, China is primed to increase its stock of them by 87%. About 80% of new buildings are going up in cities away from developed coastal areas of the Pearl river delta and Yangtze river delta, which Barclays called \"evidence of the expanding building bubble\". Lawrence, who was lead author of the report, said China's property market is already wobbling. The number of residential property sales had decreased by 40-50% in Beijing and Shanghai and developers had slashed prices by 5-20%, he said. India, which has just two skyscrapers but is building 14 more, takes top honours for hubris: The second tallest building in the world, the Tower of India, is now under construction in Mumbai. Nonperforming loans in India \u2014 a substantial number of them to real estate ventures \u2014 grew by nearly a third in the first half of this fiscal year, more than triple the average annual growth rate since 2006, according to the Reserve Bank of India. BarCap said: \"If history proves to be right, this building boom in India and China could simply be a reflection of a misallocation of capital, which may result in an economic correction for two of Asia's largest economies in the next five years.\" A branch of economics founded by followers of US economist Henry George has charted property collapses over the last 100 years and found that booms create the conditions for a downturn around every 18 years. Fred Harrison, a Georgist and research director of the Land Research Trust, wrote in his 1997 book The Chaos Makers that \"by 2007 Britain and most of the other industrially advanced economies will be in the throes of frenzied activity in the land market \u2026 Land prices will be near their 18-year peak \u2026 on the verge of the collapse that will presage the global depression of 2010.\"",

The Office for National Statistics said the UK's trade deficit widened \u00a30.7bn to \u00a38.6bn as exports to non-EU countries fell and imports from non-EU countries rose to a record high. The gap compared with economists' forecasts for \u00a38.3bn and with an upwardly revised \u00a37.9bn in October. Economists said that net trade did probably make a positive contribution to the UK economy in the final quarter of 2011 but would probably not be enough to avoid overall growth being virtually flat or even negative thanks in part to a slump in consumer spending. There were also warnings that the government's hopes of rebalancing the economy away from domestic demand towards manufacturing and foreign trade will be hard to realise this year. \"Exports appear to have regained a modest upward trend in recent months, which is likely to have persisted into December. Trade is nevertheless unlikely to contribute strongly to UK economic growth in 2012, which looks set to be a challenging year as signs of improved demand from countries such as the US and China are likely to be countered by weak demand in the eurozone,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. \"The longer term outlook is one where 2012 looks set to be a challenging year for UK exporters.\" The news of falling exports and official figures showing a dip in growth in Britain's key European trading partner Germany renewed calls for exporters to look further afield to emerging markets. \"The UK is pinning much of its hopes on exports to power the recovery, but with our main markets struggling it's imperative that exporters look to new, faster-growing, markets if they are to play their part,\" said Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club. \"The UK lags well behind other developed economies, such as Germany, in its penetration of emerging markets, but with our traditional markets facing a long, hard struggle, the time is right for UK exporters to make that move.\" In November, despite the ongoing eurozone crisis, there was a slight rise in exports from the UK to its most important trading area. Exports to the European Union edged up \u2013 albeit by less than \u00a30.1bn \u2013 while exports to non-EU countries fell \u00a30.4bn from October. Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics the rise in exports to EU countries was surprising but unlikely to be sustained. \"We doubt that the recent resilience will last as eurozone demand weakens. The recent rise in the pound to a 16 month high against the euro won't help either,\" she said. The ONS said the overall drop in exports was driven by lower exports of silver to non-EU countries, including India. At the same time, imports rose \u00a30.4bn, driven largely by goods coming in from EU countries and slightly higher imports from non-EU countries, which reached a record level. The overall rise in imports was driven by higher imports of chemicals largely from EU countries, including Ireland. The ONS said the trade deficit for goods and services taken together widened to \u00a32.6bn from \u00a31.9bn as the services surplus held steady.",

      "bodyText": "The government is pinning a lot of hope on the economy rebalancing. It wants manufacturing, inventions and exports to take the place of high street spending and government outlays. It wants brave new entrepreneurs creating jobs with brave new businesses. The obvious hurdle to all this is the crisis in the eurozone \u2013 currently the UK's most important trading area \u2013 which is rattling business confidence and hurting exports, as indicated in Wednesday's widening of the trade deficit. But another significant obstacle to the private sector picking up the slack from a shrinking public sector is a shaky housing market. It has long been the case that entrepreneurs take out loans against their homes to start a business or to expand or shore up one they have been running for a while. And given it's no secret that bank loans are harder to come by, we should expect this trend for entrepreneurs to use mortgages to have picked up. Indeed, new research from one lender suggests small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are now just as likely to apply for a secured loan as they would an unsecured loan or an overdraft to get access to funds. But with UK house prices facing a year of stagnation or even declines, according to most forecasters, that source of finance is not as safe as ministers may wish it to be if they want entrepreneurs to pop up everywhere. Lender Borro, which published the research into secured loan demand, forecasts a rise in SMEs lending against their personal assets in order to expand. It says that over the last year more than one in 10 small business owners in the UK have \"had to put their own homes on the line as a guarantee for a loan to continue doing business in 2011\". The survey of 300 owners and directors of small businesses also showed that a further third of small businesses would consider using their home as a guarantee if they could not get any other kind of finance to help with issues such as cash-flow problems, late payments from customers, tax bills and staff wages. The relationship between SME finance and the housing market is one that Paul Tucker, the Bank of England deputy governor, drew attention to in a speech last November. He noted that rebalancing was \"already impeded by tight credit conditions\" and that eurozone instability was being reflected in \"elevated funding costs\" that banks were passing on to customers. Tight credit conditions would likely \"impede the rebalancing of the economy's productive capacity\" but that was not the only headwind.

Bank loans are not flowing freely to businesses and we cannot look to secured loans made against choppy house prices to fill the gap. For entrepreneurs, it seems other ways of staking their possessions are coming into play. Borro, which offers customers short-term loans secured against assets such as fine art, antiques, luxury watches and fine wine, reports that a quarter of small businesses said they had used or would consider using their personal assets and possessions to secure a loan for their business.

      "bodyText": "Northern Rock has been sold. Sir John Vickers's commission has reported and the government has accepted its ring-fencing plans. And we're doomed to own our Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland shares for years to come. So what's the point of UK Financial Investments (UKFI), the body set up by Alistair Darling in 2010 to \"manage\" the government's holdings in banks? Surely management these day means hanging around until the two big banks' share prices more than double. Wednesday's management shuffle is certainly an admission by UKFI that there's less to do. The organisation is losing its chairman, Sir David Cooksey, while Keith Morgan, who was holding the Northern Rock baby, has already said he is departing soon. No fresh faces are entering the building. Instead, Robin Budenberg, the chief executive, will become executive chairman (temporarily) and his right-hand man, Jim O'Neil, will become chief executive. Why not go the whole hog and disband UKFI? It has only a dozen or so full-time employees. Couldn't a rump work happily within the Treasury? There is no convincing answer for why not. It's easy to agree that the Treasury should be able to call upon the services of officials with their eyes and ears permanently focused on what's going on RBS and Lloyds \u2013 we've invested \u00a360bn in the shares, don't forget. But it's far from clear that these people need to work separately from the Treasury. After all, the chancellor, George Osborne, seems happy to ignore his supposed arm's-length relationship with the banks \u2013 for example, when telling RBS to get smaller in investment banking. Nor is it clear why UKFI needs to be led by former investment bankers such as Budenberg and O'Neil. Their specialist field is choosing the right moment to sell the right number of shares, a skill not currently required. One of UKFI's other main tasks seems to be to act as a buffer and mediator in the annual punch-up over bonuses. Do we need investment bankers for that? The government, when it says it wants to clamp down on \"crony capitalism\", advocates greater diversity on pay committees. If it followed that logic, it would appoint non-bankers to talk bonuses with the boards of Lloyds and RBS. Still, at least UKFI's ex-investment bankers are fairly cheap. The organisation had a \u00a32.7m budget last year and, in the private sector, Budenberg could command a bigger salary than the \u00a3148,000 he received in 2010-11. If his presence, and that of O'Neil, ensures the Treasury spends less on investment banking advice, that may be one good reason for UKFI to survive. But it's hard to think of others.",

      "body": "<p>Northern Rock has been sold. Sir John Vickers's commission has reported and the government has accepted its ring-fencing plans. And we're doomed to own our Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland shares for years to come. So what's the point of UK Financial Investments (UKFI), the body set up by Alistair Darling in 2010 to \"manage\" the government's holdings in banks? Surely management these day means hanging around until the two big banks' share prices more than double.</p> <p>Wednesday's management shuffle is certainly an admission by UKFI that there's less to do. The organisation is losing its chairman, Sir David Cooksey, while Keith Morgan, who was holding the Northern Rock baby, has already said he is departing soon. No fresh faces are entering the building. Instead, Robin Budenberg, the chief executive, will become executive chairman (temporarily) and his right-hand man, Jim O'Neil, will become chief executive. Why not go the whole hog and disband UKFI? It has only a dozen or so full-time employees. Couldn't a rump work happily within the Treasury?</p> <p>There is no convincing answer for why not. It's easy to agree that the Treasury should be able to call upon the services of officials with their eyes and ears permanently focused on what's going on RBS and Lloyds \u2013 we've invested \u00a360bn in the shares, don't forget. But it's far from clear that these people need to work separately from the Treasury. After all, the chancellor, George Osborne, seems happy to ignore his supposed arm's-length relationship with the banks \u2013 for example, when telling RBS to get smaller in investment banking.</p> <p>Nor is it clear why UKFI needs to be led by former investment bankers such as Budenberg and O'Neil. Their specialist field is choosing the right moment to sell the right number of shares, a skill not currently required. One of UKFI's other main tasks seems to be to act as a buffer and mediator in the annual punch-up over bonuses. Do we need investment bankers for that? The government, when it says it wants to clamp down on \"crony capitalism\", advocates greater diversity on pay committees. If it followed that logic, it would appoint non-bankers to talk bonuses with the boards of Lloyds and RBS.</p> <p>Still, at least UKFI's ex-investment bankers are fairly cheap. The organisation had a \u00a32.7m budget last year and, in the private sector, Budenberg could command a bigger salary than the \u00a3148,000 he received in 2010-11. If his presence, and that of O'Neil, ensures the Treasury spends less on investment banking advice, that may be one good reason for UKFI to survive. But it's hard to think of others.</p>",

But it's always been an illusion that you can take the politics out of decisions about where and how to swing the axe. Monti brought that message loud and clear to Berlin on Wednesday, warning Angela Merkel that the Italian people will only put up with so much. \"I am demanding heavy sacrifices from Italians,\" Monti told Die Welt newspaper. \"I can only do this if concrete advantages become visible.\" If not, he said, \"a protest against Europe will develop in Italy, including against Germany, which is seen as the ringleader of EU intolerance, and against the European Central Bank.\" In other words, Monti is not just dealing in abstract calculations; his decisions will have a severe impact on the lives of ordinary Italians, and they're entitled to ask what it's all for \u2013 particularly when many analysts believe the end result will be a deeper recession and an even worse outlook for the public finances. That fear is reflected in the fact that Italy's bond yields remain above 7%, close to unsustainable levels, despite the latest austerity measures, which were meant to offer comfort to investors nervous about Italy's fiscal position. Instead, they have deepened concerns about a likely recession. It's worth remembering just how much pain is being inflicted on the Italians. Dario Perkins of Lombard Street Research points out in a new note that even under Berlusconi, spending cuts and tax rises worth 2% of GDP were already due to take effect in 2012. Monti has since announced an extra \u20ac20bn of additional austerity measures, or another 1.3% of GDP, for this year alone. That will squeeze economic demand severely, just as almost every other continental economy \u2013 as well as the US and the UK \u2013 launches its own austerity measures. The OECD estimates that the deflationary impact of fiscal tightening increases by almost a third when other countries are cutting back too. Growing hardship in Italy \u2013 and in Spain, where youth unemployment is already above 40%, and the new rightwing government has also joined the austerity bandwagon \u2013 is inevitable. Like the Greek politicians raising the spectre of state bankruptcy, Monti is trying to strengthen his own hand in tough negotiations. But he's quite right to warn of the heavy political risks of the course Europe's leaders have chosen. By signing up to the new \"fiscal compact\", they are locking austerity into the very DNA of the eurozone, even as the evidence mounts from Greece and Portugal that it inflicts unbearable social costs without delivering the promised dividend for the public finances.",

Lenovo plans to launch its first Intel-powered smartphone in the second quarter of 2012, while Motorola will test Intel's chips this summer as part of a multi-year, multi-device collaboration which also includes tablets. In a sell note analysts at Liberum said:</p> <blockquote> Arm currently has a 100% share in the smartphone market and these wins by Intel, particularly with Motorola, suggest that its monopoly on this segment is likely to crack. Intel pricing is expected to be competitive and the company is likely to gain further share with customers like Samsung in our opinion.

      "bodyText": "News that Intel has moved into the smartphone market dominated up until now by Arm has had a predictable effect on the UK company's share price. Arm is down 7.5p to 596.5p following Intel's announcement at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that Motorola Mobility and Lenovo would use its Medfield low-power chips in its new phones. Lenovo plans to launch its first Intel-powered smartphone in the second quarter of 2012, while Motorola will test Intel's chips this summer as part of a multi-year, multi-device collaboration which also includes tablets. In a sell note analysts at Liberum said: Arm currently has a 100% share in the smartphone market and these wins by Intel, particularly with Motorola, suggest that its monopoly on this segment is likely to crack. Intel pricing is expected to be competitive and the company is likely to gain further share with customers like Samsung in our opinion. We do not believe Arm's share price is factoring in any loss of share in smartphones while it is more than fully pricing in share gains in the PC space. We maintain our sell recommendation. Mike Jeremy at Daniel Stewart also thought Arm could come under pressure from growing competition: The announcement is seen as a potential blow to Arm , which hitherto has dominated the smartphone chip market with its low-power collaborative design chip solutions.",
