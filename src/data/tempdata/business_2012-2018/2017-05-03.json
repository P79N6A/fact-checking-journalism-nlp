      "bodyText": "Adam Crozier, it could be said, is leaving ITV at a good moment for him. The business has been reinvented from its basket-case status in 2010 but now faces a tougher advertising market and the march of Netflix, Amazon and whoever comes next. Up to a point, that\u2019s correct. ITV\u2019s advertising revenues fell last year for the first time since 2009 and the US arrivals have deep pockets and grand ambitions. But there\u2019s another way to view the screen: ITV has overcome bigger hurdles. Back in 2010, the company carried so much debt it couldn\u2019t afford to pay a dividend. It made few programmes that sold abroad and Sky and YouTube were the existential threats of the day. The City despaired. It thought a rescue rights issue was inevitable and analysts promoted the drastic remedy of ditching programme making and becoming a pure broadcaster that would buy in all its content. Crozier and former chairman Archie Norman rightly resisted quick cures. They thought a properly managed ITV could live without fresh capital and they have proved their point in spades: since 2011 ITV has paid a total of 55p per share in dividends, which equates to the share price when Crozier arrived. These days ITV is accused of having too little debt, not too much. Crozier has also been vindicated in his belief that making popular programmes is not as hard as old ITV, during the wilderness years under Lord Grade, made it seem. Spare cash has been spent on buying interesting production houses \u2013 a majority stake in World Productions, producer of Line of Duty, was acquired this week, for example. The net result is a business where advertising and non-advertising revenues are in balance, a transformation from a decade ago. Content is sold around the globe and a serious US production business created. In short, ITV has become the company it was meant to be after the merger of Carlton and Granada in 2004. The picture could change again, of course, or Liberty Media could decide this is the moment to make the much-rumoured bid. Yet more of the same is a perfectly credible script. ITV generates lots of cash and UK advertisers \u2013 even in the current weak market \u2013 can\u2019t ignore its virtual monopoly on commercial prime-time TV audiences. Meanwhile, Netflix et al are also buyers of content, including from ITV, as Crozier often points out. The process that led to his appointment seven years ago was tortuous \u2013 better drama than on the screen, it was said. This time new chairman Sir Peter Bazalgette can expect a stampede of credible applicants. Argos a bright spot for Sainsbury\u2019s Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, likes to take a long view. Two years ago, he said the UK market was \u201cchanging faster than at any time in the past 30 years\u201d. And now? The past year has been \u201cone of the most interesting and challenging and volatile years in my working lifetime\u201d. Translation: the retailing weather for supermarkets continues to be horrible. Even the purchase of Argos could not prevent Sainsbury\u2019s profits falling for a third year in a row, down 1% on an underlying basis to \u00a3581m. Coupe, to be fair, can also legitimately claim significant progress beneath the surface. The Argos deal now looks smart. The store-in-store formats are working and it is possible to believe that, over time, Sainsbury\u2019s could double or even triple Argos\u2019s contribution to profits. It\u2019s just that the entire grocery industry now knows its old profit margins aren\u2019t coming back. Sainsbury\u2019s, even with like-for-like sales down 0.6% in the supermarkets last year, just has to keep plugging away. It has a sensible dividend strategy that distributes half the earnings to investors every year. Life could be worse. Just ask Tesco shareholders. They survive on thinner dividends and a supposed recovery has seen Tesco shares fall 13% so far this year. Sainsbury\u2019s shares are at least marginally higher. McDonald leaps out of the saddle at Halfords Good luck to Jill McDonald, the latest person to try to invigorate Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s clothing and home business. The survival period for M&amp;S clothing bosses who fail to make their mark is about two years, so she\u2019s taking a career risk, even if the incentive package is juicy. But isn\u2019t there also something indecent about the haste with which she\u2019s pedalling out of Halfords? McDonald became chief executive at the bikes and car parts retailer two years ago and is only halfway through a three-year strategic plan. She\u2019s suffered bad luck, in the form of a sterling devaluation that is unhelpful if you buy most of your bicycles from the Far East, but is still abandoning a job half-done. That doesn\u2019t look good in the public company world. Halfords is holding her to her six-month notice period \u2013 so it should.",

      "bodyText": "London estate agents have begun to offer free cars worth \u00a318,000, stamp duty subsidies of \u00a3150,000, plus free iPads and Sonos sound systems to kickstart sales in the capital\u2019s increasingly moribund property market. The once super-hot central London market has turned into a \u201cburnt-out core\u201d according to buying agents Garrington Property Finders, prompting developers to offer ever greater incentives to lure buyers. At one development in Muswell Hill, a relatively affluent part of north London, sales agents said this week they would be giving away a Renault Zoe electric car (RRP \u00a318,045) to every house buyer. They would also pay stamp duty on the \u00a31.99m homes, at \u00a3153,000. Apart from the free prosecco and gourmet pizzas available to those viewing the properties, anyone willing to put down a \u00a32,500 deposit at the development\u2019s launch night this week will also walk away with a free iPad. The developer, Jamm, insists that sales are robust and that \u201cthis is absolutely not a sign of desperation\u201d. Director Tim Jackson said: \u201cThere is a lot of nervousness out there with the election and Brexit, and buyers are looking for excuses not to buy. We\u2019re giving them reasons to buy.\u201d Free furniture packages worth up to \u00a320,000, John Lewis vouchers, and free three-year travel passes have all been offered to potential buyers in other developments across the capital. Property agent Henry Pryor estimates that there is a pipeline of 59,000 high-end apartments under construction in London alone, yet annual sales of new-build flats in the city are only 6,000. \u201cDevelopers will sell their first-born to shift them. It\u2019s last-chance-saloon stuff. About the only incentive they have not tried is a bogof [buy one, get one free].\u201d The developer behind the giant Battersea Power Station development of 4,360 apartments in south London last week slashed its profit forecasts amid rising costs and wider economic uncertainty. House prices have begun to fall nationally \u2013 Nationwide said typical prices fell in both March and April \u2013 and the steepest drops have been seen in London. Land Registry figures show that in the heart of the city\u2019s financial district, average property prices plummeted from \u00a3861,000 at the time of the EU referendum to \u00a3773,000 in February, a decline of 15%, although in London\u2019s outer boroughs prices are still up over the year. Transactions \u2013 the lifeblood of estate agents, who rely on turnover rather than high prices to make money \u2013 have also fallen steeply. Garrington said the \u201chipster hotspot\u201d of Hackney saw sales collapse by more than a third in 2016, and there have been few signs of a recovery since. LCP, a property investment company, blamed big hikes in stamp duty for a collapse in sales. It said that in central London, sales of new flats were down 41.4% in the last three months of 2016 compared with the previous year, while average prices fell 8.7% over the same period to \u00a31.9m. Chinese buyers had melted away, Pryor said. \u201cThe Chinese are finding it more difficult to borrow from their own banks and the gloss has gone off the London market. Foreign buyers were a very significant part of the new-build market, but they can\u2019t get a yield, and they now can\u2019t flip them for capital gain.\u201d Pryor reckons it could be years before prices for new-build flats start rising again. \u201cIf you could short new-build property, then you would make a mint, but there\u2019s no market. In my 28 years in the property business, we have done this twice before, and each time it takes around five to seven years before things recover.\u201d But tenants are winners from the post-Brexit decline in the property market. Rents in London have fallen sharply, with new tenants in the capital typically paying almost \u00a3100 a month less than their counterparts a year ago. The average monthly rent in the capital dropped from \u00a31,297 a year ago to \u00a31,203 in March 2017, said Your Move, which publishes a regular buy-to-let index. In March alone, typical rents in the capital fell 6%, it added.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lidl is on track to overtake Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s seventh-biggest grocer as early as this summer as the discounters benefit from new store openings and shoppers search out bargains amid a return to food price inflation. Lidl and fellow German chain Aldi increased their pace of growth in the past three months to the extent that the former controls 5% of the \u00a3180bn UK grocery market, just 0.2 percentage points behind Waitrose. Britain\u2019s supermarkets enjoyed the fastest sales growth in three-and-a-half years over the past three months, boosted by a pickup in food inflation and strong sales of Easter eggs. The UK grocery market grew by 3.7% over the period, adding almost \u00a31bn in sales compared with a year earlier, according to consumer consultancy Kantar Worldpanel. But Aldi and Lidl continue to grow the fastest, 18.3% and 17.8% respectively, up from 14.3% and 15% reported last month. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said Lidl was likely to overtake Waitrose briefly this summer and consolidate its position next year at the current rate of growth. Aldi overtook Waitrose in 2015 and then, in February, it moved past the Co-op to become the UK\u2019s fifth-biggest grocer. McKevitt said the discounters would seek to cash in on shoppers\u2019 concerns about rising prices and economic difficulties, but the major supermarkets would be fighting back. \u201cAll 10 major retailers are in growth for the first time in three-and-a-half years, when we last saw like-for-like grocery inflation as high as it is now,\u201d he said. Lidl and Aldi were growing fast as a result of rapid store openings, and shoppers visiting them more often and buying more items on each visit. The discounters\u2019 performance was also lifted by price increases. Prices across the grocery market rose by 2.6% over the past quarter, up from 2.3% in the three months to the end of March. The cost of groceries began rising towards the end of 2016 after two years of falling prices. Butter, fish and fresh lamb are dearer, but crisps, bacon and fresh poultry are becoming cheaper. Shoppers splashed out \u00a3325m on Easter eggs, with almost three-quarters of the population buying at least one. Last year, \u00a3294m was spent on Easter eggs. Separate monthly figures from data company Nielsen painted a similar picture. Takings at supermarket tills rose by 8.6% in the four weeks to 22 April, while the volume of goods sold rose by 3.2%. \u201cImpulse purchases\u201d such as crisps and confectionery led sales growth, followed by drinks and fresh food. Mike Watkins, Nielsen\u2019s UK head of retailer and business insight, said: \u201cThis shows the underlying health of the supermarket industry is pretty good, even if we exclude the positive distortion caused by the late Easter. For example, when purely comparing Easter weeks this year and last year, sales were up 3.5%.\u201d Kantar said premium own-label products were popular among shoppers, for example \u201cThe Best\u201d line at Morrisons, which has pulled in more affluent customers since its launch last year, helping the Bradford-based grocer become the fastest-growing supermarket among the big four \u2013 including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda. Tesco returned to growth with sales up by 1.9%. Asda posted its first sales growth since October 2014, while Sainsbury\u2019s sales rise of 1.7% was the biggest since June 2014.",

      "bodyText": "Many financial experts are concluding that the Federal Reserve is getting ready to raise interest rates in June, given the language in today\u2019s statement. Here\u2019s Moody\u2019s: This is Bloomberg\u2019s take: Naeem Aslam of Think Markets writes: The FOMC statement was hawkish and the Fed has clearly given a message to the markets that they think the weakness in the economic data is only temporary. This means that the Fed is more than happy with their current strategy and more rate hikes are coming this year - at least for now. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital predicts that Fed official will start dropping hints of a June rate rise soon - if they\u2019re really getting ready, that is.... The Fed is in no rush to raise rates too quickly as it\u2019s fully aware that rising inflation is less of a threat than tightening too fast, noting that it will stabilise around its 2% target. On the whole, today\u2019s decision changes very little in the assessment for monetary policy. All eyes now on the minutes from the meeting and jawboning from officials in the coming weeks.\u201d And Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics points out that the US jobs data (starting on Friday) will be crucial... On balance, we still think that the Fed will hike again in June, although that assumes employment growth rebounds in April and May. The drop off in core inflation is a concern, but the global economic backdrop is much stronger than it was last year. Furthermore, although the Fed hiked rates twice since late last year, financial conditions have actually loosened, with the dollar and bond yields both falling, while stock markets have performed strongly. A late newsflash: America\u2019s central bank has left interest rates on hold. The Federal Reserve also predicted that the slowdown in the first quarter of 2017 was probably only temporary. That could be a sign that the Fed could raise interest rates in June. The Fed\u2019s statement looks quite hawkish, with US policymakers pointing out that the US jobs market looks solid, firms continue to invest, and inflation is close to its target. Here\u2019s the key section: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen even as growth in economic activity slowed. Job gains were solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate declined. Household spending rose only modestly, but the fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of consumption remained solid. Business fixed investment firmed. Inflation measured on a 12-month basis recently has been running close to the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer-run objective. Traders on Wall Street like the look of the statement, sending shares up: With better than expected eurozone GDP figures, markets managed to edge higher for the most part. Exceptions were France, ahead of the country\u2019s presidential debate later, and the UK, with investors unsettled by the increasing testy relations between the country and the European Union. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 15.52 points or 0.21% at 7234.53 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.16% to 12,527.84 France\u2019s Cac fell 0.06% to 5301.00 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.13% to 20,759.31 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.15% at 10,837.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 2% to 748.61 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 21 points or 0.1% lower. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Sterling has slipped back after Theresa May accused the EU of attempting to influence the outcome of the UK general election. The pound, which had earlier climbed as high as $1.2949 against the dollar, is currently down 0.26% at $1.2902. Jameel Ahmad, vice president at FXTM, said: While the British Pound has hardly tumbled as of writing, the comments from Theresa May on Wednesday afternoon do go some way towards disclosing how strained relations with the European Union have become after invoking Article 50, and the risk of them becoming worse are significant when you consider how tense the negotiations with the EU are likely to get over the next two years. Follow the latest political developments in our live blog here: US crude inventories dropped last week, but not as much as analysts had been forecasting. According to the Energy Information Administration, crude stocks fell by 930.000 barrels to 527.77m, but this was below forecasts of a 2.3m decline. But gasoline stocks rose by less than expected, up 191,000 barrels compared to an expected rise of 1.3m barrels. US crude prices have reversed earlier gains following the EIA update, and are now down 0.7% at a day\u2019s low of $47.32 a barrel, the lowest since the end of March. Here\u2019s what some of the respondents to the ISM report said: \u201cBusiness level increasing. More project inquiries are being received.\u201d (Construction) \u201cBeginning of Q2, business is profitable, maybe a bit slower than anticipated. Opportunity still positive.\u201d (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u201cStable activity. Waiting on health care reform and its impact on our organization.\u201d (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u201cOngoing rain in Northern California is degrading the quality and increasing the prices of some vegetables, such as iceberg lettuce, broccoli, napa cabbage, and some varieties of romaine.\u201d (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u201c[Overall] positive outlook for Q2, Q3, and Q4 [in] 2017.\u201d (Retail Trade) \u201cOptimistic business outlook, but cautious in light of [the] geopolitical instability with North Korea.\u201d (Management of Companies &amp; Support Services) \u201cFirst three months of 2017, sales have exceeded each of [the first] three months of 2016.\u201d (Wholesale Trade) And the second of the day\u2019s surveys of the US service sector shows a similar picture. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI rose from 55.2 in March to 57.5 in April, better than the expected 55.8. The new orders index jumped from 58.9 to 63.2, but the employment index was at its lowest level since August. The US service sector unexpectedly rose in April, according to the first of two sector surveys. The Markit services PMI came in at 53.1, compared to the initial reading of 52.5 and the final March figure of 52.8. The composite reading - manufacturing and services - rose from 53 in March to 53.2. US markets have fallen back in early trading, not helped by Apple\u2019s latest update showing a surprise drop in iPhone sales. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 35 points or 0.17% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.27% lower and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.34%. Apple itself is down around 1.6%, losing $12bn off its market capitalisation of $773bn. Meanwhile, the latest service sector surveys from both Markit and ISM are due shortly. Following the US private employment numbers, analysts are looking forward to the official non-farm payroll figures on Friday. And there could be a bounceback after last month\u2019s disappointment, some believe. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: ADP for April showed the US added 177,000 private payroll jobs, pretty much as expected. Last month the ADP number beat expectations by around 80,000 jobs. This led many analysts to upgrade their forecasts for the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Non-Farm Payrolls. But these missed even the unrevised predictions by over 70,000 raising concerns about the outlook for this Friday\u2019s number. The expectation is that last month\u2019s number was a seasonal aberration, so the hope is we get a strong bounce-back in the data in two days\u2019 time. The current forecast is for a gain of around 200,000 after the 98,000 recorded in March. Here\u2019s Danske Bank on the US jobs numbers: Newsflash: America\u2019s companies created 177,000 new jobs last month. That\u2019s down on the 255,000 created in March, and the lowest private sector job creation figure since October. The figures come from payroll firm ADP. This sets up Friday\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, the wider measure of the US labour market. Economists predict that around 200,000 new jobs were created overall, after March\u2019s disappointingly weak 98,000. European stock markets are still in the red, with the FTSE 100 down 22 points, or 0.3%, at 7227. Wall Street is expected to follow suit in 80 minutes time: Economists are predicting that the eurozone will have a decent 2017, following the news that GDP grew by a healthy 0.5% in the first three months of this year. Here\u2019s some reaction.... Shilen Shah, Bond Strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment. \u201cDespite the political headwinds facing the Eurozone in 2017, it produced a decent GDP print for the first quarter at 0.5%. In contrast to the more tepid performance in the UK and US, the Eurozone\u2019s performance does suggest that rest of the year is likely to be solid given the supportive PMI prints. Despite some tightness in the German labour market, the relatively high level of unemployment for the Eurozone as a whole would indicate that there remains a significant amount of spare capacity, suggesting a period of above trend growth is possible.\u201d ING Bank are also upbeat: And here\u2019s Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital..... One UK construction firm isn\u2019t doing too well today. Shares in Galliford Try have slumped by over 9% today, after the company revealed it\u2019s taking a one-off charge of around \u00a398m on two large building projects. CEO Peter Truscott says the loss is \u201cregrettable\u201d, adding that the company won\u2019t undertake large infrastructure jobs on fixed price contracts anymore. Lesson learned.... Over in Athens, a shot has been fired across the bows of the Greek government\u2019s optimism following yesterday\u2019s breakthrough agreement in talks with creditors. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports. While the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has called for a cabinet meeting on Thursday to discuss the government\u2019s next moves, criticism is already mounting in the ruling Syriza party. Senior leftists are emphasising that there is little to be joyful about following the leftist-led government\u2019s latest cave-in to creditors. Nikos Filis, the former education minister and highly regarded Syriza figure, has gone so far as to express doubt that \u201ccounter-measures\u201d struck by the government to offset losses that pension cuts and tax rises will inevitably engender, will work at all. \u201cThe preliminary agreement for the conclusion of the second review marks the country remaining in the suffocating memorandum,\u201d he wrote, referring to the onerous bailout programme Athens has signed with lenders. Describing the prospect of counter-measures being applied as \u201cdubiously positive,\u201d he said it was far from sure that poorer Greeks who will be most affected by pension reductions and bigger taxes would be relieved by any measures in the future. \u201cIt is not sure that they are enough to heal the pain that will continue to exist for the weakest social strata,\u201d he added in the article published in today\u2019s Syntaktwn newspaper. The government has said that by 2019, when pension cuts will be applied, a support programme will also be enforced for more vulnerable Greeks. The criticism was echoed late Tuesday by the Parliament Budget Office which warned that in the uncertainty of the long-stalled second review, it was now far from certain that Greece would achieve a projected growth rate of 2.7% this year. That would in turn expose the country to multiple risks, it said in its quarterly review. Following the concessions the government had been forced to make to close the review, the body quipped that Greece was in danger of falling into an \u201causterity trap\u201d in which constant tax increases and shrinking expenditure ultimately chip away at gross domestic product and increase the country\u2019s already massive debt load. Anyone getting over-excited about the eurozone\u2019s recovery should remember that it also started 2015 and 2016 strongly, but then faded over the summer. Economist Rupert Seggins has the details: Cathal Kennedy suspects that Germany outperformed the wider eurozone in the first quarter of 2017 (and also beat the UK). Here\u2019s his take on the GDP report: If the large euro area economies, only France and Spain publish growth estimates in advance of today\u2019s release. Taken alongside those, today\u2019s aggregate euro area number suggests that next week\u2019s German release will show expansion in the region of 0.7% q/q in Q1. Early survey data for Q2 is consistent with the current pace of growth continuing into the second quarter. The April \u2018flash\u2019 PMIs are up on their, already elevated, Q1 average while the Economic Sentiment Indicator also rose from its Q1 average of 107.9 to 109.6 last month. Disappointingly, we\u2019ll have to wait until 12 May to find out how Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest member, fared in Q1. But today\u2019s solid-looking growth figures do suggest that the eurozone recovery is on track, raising the changes that the European Central Bank rethinks its current ultra-loose monetary policy stance. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: Eurozone growth was a healthy 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2017, which matched the upwardly revised fourth-quarter 2016 performance. No component breakdown was provided of the first-quarter Eurozone GDP, but we expect the healthy growth was very much domestic-demand led, with consumer spending and business investment playing a key role.... the healthy first-quarter Eurozone growth performance reinforces belief that the ECB will likely drop the reference to lower interest rates in its forward guidance at its June meeting. Here\u2019s more reaction: Breaking: The eurozone recovery continues! GDP across the single currency grew by 0.5% in the first three months of 2017, new figures from Eurostat show. That\u2019s stronger than the UK, which only grew by 0.3%, and the US, which expanded by less than 0.2% in Q1. And in another boost, the eurozone\u2019s growth rate for the last three months of 2016 has also been revised up to 0.5%, from 0.4%. This surely reinforces hops that the European economy has entered a period of stronger growth, as fears of political instability and debt crises receded. I\u2019ll pull together some reaction now.... Experts are warning that British builders are worried about Brexit, even though construction output accelerated last month: Here\u2019s Max Jones, global corporates relationship director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking: \u201cAs these figures reflect, the sector is currently in relatively confident mood with the next few weeks of uncertainty leading up to the general election seen by many as a reasonable trade-off given it will result in a government in place until 2022. \u201cInstead, some of the nervousness is coming from contractors with a focus on infrastructure, where the pipeline remains strong. The success of Crossrail has shown that mega-projects can be delivered on time and on budget but there are concerns about how government decision-making on infrastructure may be affected given the focus on Brexit negotiations. \u201cA further worry is skills and the fears over future access to EU workers, on which the UK construction industry is so reliant. Here, firms are continuing to use joint ventures to spread risk, share labour resources and ensure the best possible teams are available for the job.\u201d And here\u2019s Paul Trigg, construction specialist and assistant head of risk underwriting at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes: \u201cDespite recent robust performance across construction, we expect the sector to see anaemic growth in the short to mid-term as concerns about falling inward investment levels, thinning long-term order books and access to skills grow. \u201cThe outcome of the Brexit negotiations will be particularly key for construction, given its reliance on migrant labour and raw materials from overseas. Further rises in input costs due to more expensive recruitment and import costs will squeeze margins that are already under pressure, pushing up the strain on prompt payments across the supply chain and potentially the number of business failures in the industry.\u201d The construction sector is looking resilient, says Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: \u201cWith the biggest rise in new orders since the beginning of the year, the sector is in a strong pre- election position buoyed up by a hardy UK economy and strong client confidence. The housing sector offered up the best news recovering from last month\u2019s minor blip and building on its strongest performance since the end of last year. \u201cEmployment growth rose to its highest since May 2016, though continued disquiet about the lack of highly-skilled labour availability persisted and which must be addressed if the future strength of the sector is to be assured. Combined with the vexatious conditions of rising commodity and labour costs, low stocks of essential materials and longer delivery times frustrated buyers and added drag to the completion of planned projects. UK builders are also pretty upbeat about their prospects over the next year, suggesting little concern over Brexit. Markit says: Around five times as many survey respondents (49%) expect a rise in construction output over the year ahead as those that forecast a fall (10%). The degree of confidence was down fractionally since March, but still well above the post- referendum low seen in July 2016. Breaking! Britain\u2019s building sector expanded at its fastest pace in four months in April, as the construction industry picks up steam. Markit\u2019s construction PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has jumped to 53.1 from 52.2 in March. That beats forecasts of a small fall to 52.0 (any reading over 50 shows growth). The pick-up was driven by \u201cfaster rises in civil engineering and residential building activity\u201d, says Markit. Builders reported that they took on more staff last month, as a \u201csustained improvement in client demand\u201d meant they had more work to deal with. Tim Moore, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, says construction growth picked up last month despite weaker demand for commercial construction. \u201cApril\u2019s survey reveals a positive start to the second quarter of 2017, with a robust upturn in civil engineering activity helping to boost the construction industry. There were also more encouraging signs from the house building sector, as growth recovered to its strongest so far this year. However, the performance of the commercial building sector remained subdued in the context of the past four years. \u201cUK construction companies noted that the resilient economic backdrop helped to drive up client spending in April. Greater workloads led to the fastest pace of job creation since May 2016 and a continued squeeze on sub-contractor availability Sterling has been rather volatile this morning, as the latest shots in the Brexit battle trouble traders. The pound lost half a cent in early trading, following a report in the Financial Times that Britain\u2019s bill for leaving the EU could be \u20ac100bn. It then recovered back over $1.29, after Brexit minister David Davis declared that \u201cwe\u2019ll not be paying 100 billion\u201d, and ruled out going into negotiations as a \u201csupplicant\u201d. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale warns: Renewed concerns about Brexit have put sterling on the back foot, at least for now. After hitting 20-month highs on Tuesday, European stock markets have dipped in early trading. Traders are holding fire until the eurozone growth figures flash up in an hour\u2019s time. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: That inertia is partly informed by investors waiting for the region\u2019s first quarter GDP reading \u2013 which is forecast to rise to 0.5% from Q4\u2019s 0.4% \u2013 before making any significant moves. Sainsbury\u2019s shares are also taking an early morning hit. They\u2019ve lost almost 3%, after the supermarket chain reported that profits fell to \u00a3503m in the last 12 months, down from \u00a3548m a year earlier. CEO Mike Coupe says it was a \u201cpivotal year\u201d, which included the takeover of catalogue chain Argos. That deal already seems to be paying off. Argos\u2019s like-for-like sales jumped by 4.1%, while Sainsbury\u2019s fell slightly. City analysts are worried that the core business looks sluggish John Ibbotson, director of the retail consultancy Retail Vision, says Argos is turning into a \u2018lifeboat\u2019 for the rest of the group: \u201cArgos has so far proved an effective \u2018get out of jail\u2019 card for Sainsbury\u2019s. But with inflation biting into consumer spending and the latest retail sales figures showing that the consumption boom is waning, Sainsbury\u2019s must get its core business in order before it comes off its catalogue crutches.\u201d In other surprise corporate news, Marks &amp; Spencer has snaffled Halford\u2019s chief executive to revitalise its struggling clothing operation. Jill McDonald will join M&amp;S in the autumn as managing director for clothing, home and beauty. It\u2019s the latest piece in CEO Steve Rowe\u2019s turnaround plan. Last year M&amp;S suffered its worst fall in clothing sales in a decade, so there\u2019s plenty for McDonald - who calls herself a longtime \u201cM&amp;S customer and professional fan\u201d - to sort out.... Halford\u2019s investors won\u2019t be happy, though - shares are down almost 4% in early trading. Big news in the City this morning: Adam Crozier, the boss of ITV, is leaving after a seven-year stint at the broadcaster. He\u2019s done a good job too, EBITA profits are up over 300% on his watch, and the shares have quadrupled thanks to the success of shows like Downton Abbey and X Factor. He also bought Mammoth Screen, which created the hit television series Poldark that was broadcast on BBC. Speculation has been swirling for some time that Crozier might be off; ITV reportedly hired headhunters in January to find a successor for the former head of the Football Association and Royal Mail. But ITV haven\u2019t yet announced his successor, and the company\u2019s shares have just dropped by 2.2% at the start of trading. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Crozier, who led a turnaround at ITV after the post-credit crunch recession and successfully reduced the broadcaster\u2019s reliance on advertising revenue by building up its production arm, said he planned to build a portfolio of roles in the next stage of his career. The company\u2019s finance director, Ian Griffiths, will step up to a new combined role of chief operating officer and finance chief and run the company for an interim period, while the chairman, Sir Peter Bazalgette, becomes executive chairman during that time. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After years of slow growth, austerity and bailout drama, is Europe\u2019s economy now rattling ahead? We find out at 10am BST when eurozone GDP figures for the first three months of this year are released. Economists predict that the euro economy grew by a punchy 0.5% in January to March, which would outpace Britain which only expanded by 0.3%. Last week we learned that France\u2019s economy only grew by 0.3%, while Spain managed a healthy 0.8%. Today\u2019s report should give a wider picture of the currency bloc Recent \u2018soft\u2019 data from the eurozone has been impressive, with factory growth at a six-year high. So this is the moment when we scrutinise the \u2018hard\u2019 data to see if the eurozone has really turned a corner. RBC Capital Markets explain: Euro area survey data has been universally strong since the turn of the year; the average composite PMI for Q1 was the highest in six years and is pointing to GDP growth of 0.5\u20130.6%. However, harder data has yet to reflect the improved sentiment; outside Germany, industrial production is likely to be a drag on growth despite stronger manufacturing PMIs. We also get another healthcheck on the UK building sector, at 9.30am. The City expects a small slowdown in growth, with the construction PMI tipped to fall to 52.0 from 52.2. We\u2019ll be looking for signs that builders are facing any impact from Brexit; perhaps through weaker demand, or a shortage of workers from overseas.... We\u2019ll also be monitoring any fallout from the latest Greek agreement. As we covered yesterday, Athens has accepted even more cuts in return for fresh loans - and the promise of debt relief..... European markets are expected to be subdued, after some solid gains in recent days. Later, US Federal Reserve announces its decision on monetary policy at 7pm BST. But no change is expected, and there is isn\u2019t a press conference scheduled. On the corporate front, we\u2019re getting results from supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s, pub chain JD Wetherspoon\u2019s, accountancy group Sage and insurance chain Direct Line.",

This led many analysts to upgrade their forecasts for the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Non-Farm Payrolls. But these missed even the unrevised predictions by over 70,000 raising concerns about the outlook for this Friday\u2019s number.</p> <p>The expectation is that last month\u2019s number was a seasonal aberration, so the hope is we get a strong bounce-back in the data in two days\u2019 time. The current forecast is for a gain of around 200,000 after the 98,000 recorded in March.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5909cdc8e4b05e7dcb97fde0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-03T12:32:21.402Z\">1.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s Danske Bank on the US jobs numbers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Danske_Research/status/859745768680435712\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/US?src=hash\">#US</a> labour market continued tightening in April, according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ADP?src=hash\">#ADP</a> jobs report <a href=\"https://t.co/4VBcO8cPZw\">pic.twitter.com/4VBcO8cPZw</a></p>&mdash; Danske Bank Research (@Danske_Research) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Danske_Research/status/859745768680435712\">May 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-05-03T12:43:37.361Z\">at 1.43pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5909cabde4b0336cfae756e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-03T12:28:20.443Z\">1.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US job creation hits six-month low</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash: America\u2019s companies created 177,000 new jobs last month.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s down on the 255,000 created in March, and the lowest private sector job creation figure since October.

      "bodyText": "Brexit would land the oil and gas industry with a half-billion-pound bill if EU exit talks end with the UK leaving on World Trade Organisation rules, Theresa May has been warned. The costs for trading \u00a373bn worth of oil and gas annually would jump from \u00a3600m a year now to \u00a31.1bn in a worst case WTO scenario, analysis for the industry trade body found. At best, if the UK could strike more favourable tariffs with non-EU countries, the cost of trade might fall to \u00a3500m, Oil and Gas UK said. The group wrote to the prime minister this week to say its members could ill afford further costs that might hamper the industry\u2019s fragile recovery after a two-year slump. \u201cWe are becoming a more globally competitive industry, but we continue to be very sensitive to any additional burdens either in relation to cost, or restrictions on the movement of key personnel required for critical operations,\u201d the body\u2019s chief executive, Deirdre Michie, wrote in a letter to May. On WTO rules, the EU would apply a 3% tariff rate on exported refined petroleum goods, with a range of tariff rates applied to other goods. The result would be an extra \u00a3260m trading cost imposed on exports, and \u00a3230m on imports. The analysis by EY for Oil and Gas UK notes that \u201cthis additional cost would be unwelcome\u201d, coming on top of the UK industry shedding more than 120,000 jobs between 2014 and 2016 as the price of oil slumped. The trade body also argued that post-Brexit freedom of movement should not be curtailed in a way that would put the industry at a \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d with other countries. About 10% of the UK oil and gas sector is from outside the country, slightly above the national average. The group urged the government to ensure that a post-Brexit immigration system would \u201censure that any added administrative burden for recruiting non-UK staff where necessary is kept to a minimum\u201d. Another post-EU issue identified as crucial by the industry body is whether the UK remains a member of the bloc\u2019s carbon trading scheme. Under the Emissions Trading System, oil refineries currently have to pay \u20ac4.45 (\u00a33.75) per tonne of carbon. Ministers have not given any signal yet of whether the UK will remain in the market. The UK oil industry has contributed \u00a3190bn to the Treasury since the 1960s, not adjusted for inflation, but prospects for the coming few years are uncertain, and oil majors have begun to sell North Sea assets to smaller, independent players. Falling production and tax relief for decommissioning old rigs caused a net drain on public finances last year, costing the exchequer \u00a3396m.",

About 10% of the UK oil and gas sector is from outside the country, slightly above the national average.</p> <p>The group urged the government to ensure that a post-Brexit immigration system would \u201censure that any added administrative burden for recruiting non-UK staff where necessary is kept to a minimum\u201d.</p> <p>Another post-EU issue identified as crucial by the industry body is whether the UK remains a member of the bloc\u2019s carbon trading scheme. Under the Emissions Trading System, oil refineries currently have to pay \u20ac4.45 (\u00a33.75) per tonne of carbon. Ministers have not given any signal yet of whether the UK will remain in the market.</p> <p>The UK oil industry has contributed \u00a3190bn to the Treasury since the 1960s, not adjusted for inflation, but prospects for the coming few years are uncertain, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/31/shell-sells-north-sea-oil-gas-fields-chrysaor-linda-cook\">oil majors have begun to sell North Sea assets to smaller, independent players</a>.</p> <p>Falling production and tax relief for decommissioning old rigs caused a net drain on public finances last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/04/north-sea-oil-and-gas-industry-cost-taxpayer-396m-in-2016\">costing the exchequer \u00a3396m</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Up to 1,000 bankers working for JP Morgan in the City of London are to be relocated to Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg as the US bank becomes the latest to set out Brexit plans. Revealing for the first time the locations that will benefit from the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, one of the US bank\u2019s most senior executives indicated that other roles would follow once the outcome of the Brexit negotiations was known. \u201cWe are going to use the three banks we already have in Europe as the anchors for our operations,\u201d Daniel Pinto, JP Morgan\u2019s head of investment banking, told Bloomberg. \u201cWe will have to move hundreds of people in the short term to be ready for day one, when negotiations finish, and then we will look at the longer-term numbers.\u201d His remarks came as Standard Chartered, which is listed in London but focuses on emerging markets, told shareholders at its annual meeting in the UK capital on Wednesday that it was in talks with regulators in Frankfurt about setting up a new subsidiary in Germany. Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, Standard Chartered\u2019s chairman, said the bank already had a branch in the German city. \u201cWe are looking at setting up a subsidiary in the EU to ensure we are prepared,\u201d he told the AGM. Standard Chartered, which is expecting to be only slightly impacted by Brexit, intends to hire a handful of staff locally in Frankfurt \u2013 where 90 are already employed \u2013 rather than move London staff to Germany. Now that article 50 \u2013 the formal process of leaving the EU \u2013 has been triggered, major City employers have also begun to outline their Brexit plans to ensure that they can keep operating in the remaining 27 EU nations. Last week, Richard Gnodde, the head of European operations at Goldman Sachs, said he would need more people in Madrid, Milan, Paris and other EU centres. Deutsche Bank has said up to 4,000 jobs from its UK workforce of 9,000 could be moved to Frankfurt and other locations in the EU because of uncertainty about Britain\u2019s relationship with the rest of the bloc. The exact scale of the JP Morgan moves has not yet been finalised, although it is thought that between 500 and 1,000 could be relocated. In the run-up to the EU referendum, JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, warned that up to 4,000 roles would be at risk in the event of a vote to leave. He has since said this figure could be higher or lower, depending on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. The bank employs about 16,000 people in the UK, with about 11,000 in the City, 4,000 in Bournemouth \u2013 it is the biggest private-sector employer in Dorset \u2013 and the remainder in Scotland. Pinto said the outcome of discussions over \u201cpassporting\u201d, under which banks can operate seamlessly across the EU, would be important. \u201cWe have to plan for a scenario where there is no UK-EU passporting deal, and we have to move a substantial portion of our business to continue serving our European clients \u2026 We\u2019ll have to wait to see what kind of deal can be achieved and see what we need to do from there,\u201d he said. In recent weeks, JP Morgan has also been linked to discussions about buying an office building in Dublin big enough to hold more than 1,000 workers, which had prompted speculation that it would be one of the locations to benefit from Brexit. However, Dublin also appears to have lost out, as Standard Chartered was linked with the Irish capital before the announcement that it was in talks about expanding in Germany. Ever since the vote for Brexit, European financial centres have been battling over the business that will need to be conducted outside the UK. While Frankfurt is often cited as the obvious location, insurance company Lloyds of London is setting up a subsidiary in Brussels, while HSBC plans to shift 1,000 roles to Paris.",

    "webTitle": "HMRC steps up inquiry into employment status of Hermes couriers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HM Revenue &amp; Customs has stepped up its investigation into the delivery company Hermes classifiying its couriers as self-employed, while the business has also been hit with an employment rights lawsuit from the GMB trade union. Drivers for Hermes were sent letters from HMRC over the weekend asking them to provide evidence as the tax authority looks into their employment status. In the letter, seen by the Guardian, HMRC requests that the drivers disclose information such as their written contract and payslips, and agree to a one-hour interview. \u201cThis will help us decide what your employment status is/was,\u201d it says. HMRC\u2019s investigation follows one by the Guardian that found some self-employed couriers were being paid less than the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, in an arrangement the company said had been approved by HMRC. Separately, GMB has filed a lawsuit challenging Hermes over employment conditions for its couriers, vowing to battle \u201cbogus self-employment and gig economy exploitation\u201d. Maria Ludkin, the GMB\u2019s legal director, said: \u201cUnder the false claims of \u2018flexibility\u2019, Hermes seems to think it\u2019s acceptable to wriggle out of treating its workers with respect. \u201cGuaranteed hours, sick pay, pension contributions \u2013 these aren\u2019t privileges to be bestowed when companies feel like it; they are the legal right of all UK workers. \u201cIt\u2019s good to hear that HMRC are finally taking their enforcement responsibilities seriously and are investigating Hermes.\u201d The union won a similar case against Uber last year, resulting in a ruling that the ride-hailing service should pay the minimum wage and grant drivers holiday pay and other benefits. Uber is contesting the ruling at the employment appeal tribunal. The case against Hermes, lodged with the employment tribunal by law firm Leigh Day, opens a new front in unions\u2019 efforts to address the precariousness of gig economy labour. Michael Newman of Leigh Day said: \u201cWe believe that Hermes are deliberately avoiding giving their couriers the rights to which they are entitled. They do so by labelling the couriers who work for them as self-employed, when the reality is different.\u201d Hermes had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. The growth of the gig economy has given rise to a series of legal disputes between workers and companies that seek to keep costs down by classifying them as something other than full employees. As well as Uber and Hermes, takeaway food delivery service Deliveroo has come under pressure from workers seeking improved conditions. The company was accused of \u201ccreating vocabulary\u201d last month, after issuing managers with a list of words to ensure it did not accidentally use terms that indicated its motorbike riders and cyclists were employees. Successive disputes over labour rights have also seen the work and pensions select committee launch an inquiry into the gig economy. The committee, led by Labour\u2019s Frank Field, has accused companies of writing contracts in \u201cgibberish\u201d, making it hard for workers, particularly those with limited English skills, to understand the terms on which they are signing up. On May Day, designated International Workers\u2019 Day in many countries, the committee called on the government to tighten up laws to prevent the exploitation of workers. GMB said it would continue looking into \u201ccontracts masquerading as bogus self-employment\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has poached the chief executive of Halfords in an attempt to revive its struggling clothing, beauty and home sections. Jill McDonald will have accountability for all aspects of M&amp;S\u2019s non-food business, from design and sourcing through to getting goods on the shelf, and will report directly to the chief executive, Steve Rowe. The appointment comes after a months-long search for somone to take charge of clothing and homeware after Rowe was promoted to the top job last year. M&amp;S had courted the former Next clothing chief Christos Angelides, but he signed up as head of fashion chain Reiss. The role is important for the future of M&amp;S, which has struggled to increase clothing sales in recent years amid tougher competition from high street rivals and difficulties with its online service. The chain has started switching space towards its more successful food business and away from fashion. McDonald\u2019s appointment is likely to disappoint the womenswear, lingerie and beauty head, Jo Jenkins, who will report to her. However, Jenkins\u2019 role has been expanded to all clothing including womenswear, menswear and childrenswear. McDonald will also work with Neal and Mark Lindsey, the multimillionaire veteran rag trade brothers, who have been tasked with sharpening up M&amp;S\u2019s buying over the past few years. She will join M&amp;S in autumn as managing director for clothing, home and beauty, after working out her notice period at Halfords, which ends in October. McDonald moves on from Halfords two years after joining from the fast food chain McDonald\u2019s, where she was in charge of the north-western Europe business. Rowe said M&amp;S was making progress with improving its clothing and home ranges, adding: \u201cThe time is now right for this appointment. Jill\u2019s first-class customer knowledge and great experience in running dynamic, high-achieving teams make her exactly the right person to lead this all-important part of our business.\u201d McDonald said she had long been an M&amp;S customer and a fan of the business, \u201cso working with the brand was a career opportunity that I just couldn\u2019t turn down\u201d. Rowe is thought to have been keen to hire a business heavyweight with strong leadership skills who would be able to pull together strategy for M&amp;S\u2019s clothing and home business and develop a strategy suited to the rapidly changing consumer environment. But industry watchers questioned the logic of hiring a clothing industry novice, whose career began at health and beauty group Colgate-Palmolive before she spent 16 years at British Airways and nearly a decade with McDonald\u2019s. One leading headhunter said McDonald was known as a good people manager, but suggested her lack of specialist knowledge of the fashion sector meant she was a high-risk choice for one of the UK\u2019s biggest clothing businesses. \u201cGenius or madness? Only time will tell,\u201d they said. David Jeary, a retail analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said: \u201cThis is an interesting appointment from an M&amp;S perspective, since Jill McDonald, whose prior roles include long stints at McDonald\u2019s and BA, cannot be seen as a clothing expert. What she does bring is considerable experience in marketing and customer relationship management, which have become even greater areas of focus under Steve Rowe\u2019s tenure.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has warned that a squeeze on real pay growth and lower consumer confidence is hitting non-food sales as it revealed a third consecutive year of falling profits. The supermarket chain\u2019s pre-tax profits slid by 8.2% to \u00a3503m in the year to 11 March despite a 12.7% rise in group sales to \u00a329.1bn, partly thanks to the acquisition of Argos last year. Analysts are expecting a further fall in profits for the year ahead. Shares in Sainsbury\u2019s dipped nearly 2% as the company missed the City\u2019s profit expectations by about 1%. The chief executive, Mike Coupe, said the past year had been \u201cone of the most interesting and challenging and volatile years in my working lifetime\u201d. After more than two years of deflation, food and fuel prices are starting to rise, driven by the devaluation of sterling and commodity price increases, and benefiting food retailers. But Sainsbury\u2019s warned this would have an impact on its newly enlarged non-food business. \u201cGeneral merchandise and clothing sales growth have been impacted by reduced consumer confidence and a marked slowdown in real pay growth. Economic commentators are divided on the implications for the UK economy, but there are fears that this slowdown in real income might drive a reduction in GDP growth, an increase in unemployment and a reduction in the rate of unsecured credit growth,\u201d the company said in a statement. Coupe defended his acquisition of the Argos chain, which has dramatically increased Sainsbury\u2019s footprint in general merchandise. He said that despite the difficult backdrop, Sainsbury\u2019s was \u201cwell set up\u201d and had increased its share of the non-food market in a challenging environment. He said the Argos acquisition would enable Sainsbury\u2019s to increase its market share in a \u201crelatively unconsolidated market where we have relatively small share in very large markets\u201d. Clothing sales rose by more than 4% over the year, for example, well ahead of the wider market. Coupe said the company had a three- to five-year plan to move towards \u201cstrong and steady\u201d profits growth. While sales fell by 2% in Sainsbury\u2019s core supermarkets amid heavy competition from the upstart discounters Aldi and Lidl and changing shopping habits, Coupe said the company was investing in growth areas including online groceries and convenience stores, where sales rose by more than 8% and 6% respectively over the year. The group is also accelerating plans to put Argos outlets in its big stores because they help attract more shoppers. It wants 250 Argos stores in its supermarkets by March 2019 \u2013 up from 59 at present \u2013 six months earlier than planned. Coupe said 13 of the 59 new Argos outlets had relocated from high streets, helping the business to save significant costs, but that pattern could not be taken as template for future openings. Sales at the Argos outlets within Sainsbury\u2019s stores open more than a year continue to grow by between 20% and 30%, helping lift grocery sales in their host supermarkets by 1% to 2%. Coupe said Argos\u2019s profits had been at the top end of expectations and he was \u201cpretty pleased with its performance\u201d as it had so far been able to mitigate against cost increases caused by the fall in the value of sterling. Things may get more tricky after June when Argos\u2019s pre-Brexit currency hedge runs out.",

    "webTitle": "Barclays chief clashes with private equity firm over family dispute", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays boss Jes Staley has incurred the wrath of one of the bank\u2019s most powerful clients, private equity giant KKR, after backing his brother-in-law in a legal dispute with the buyout house. KKR is no longer inviting Barclays to take part in potentially lucrative deals as a result and has not ruled out making a formal complaint to the bank\u2019s board, sources familiar with the matter told the Guardian. And the US buyout firm issued a thinly-veiled warning reminding Barclays of its \u201cresponsibilities\u201d to clients, in a row that threatens to expose Staley to renewed accusations of allowing personal relationships to affect the bank he runs. The chief executive apologised last month after admitting that he asked Barclays\u2019 internal security team to unmask a whistleblower, who had made accusations against an ex-colleague Staley recruited from his former employer JP Morgan. The latest dispute, revealed in the Wall Street Journal, relates to Aceco, a Brazilian technology company founded by the family of Staley\u2019s wife Debora Nitzan Staley. She and her brother Jorge Nitzan sold their stakes in Aceco to KKR in a 2014 deal that valued the company at $700m (\u00a3542m) and is said to have made the siblings $240m between them. The deal was KKR\u2019s maiden direct investment in Brazil but went sour in 2015 when the private equity giant fired Nitzan, then Aceco\u2019s chief executive, and wrote off its $475m investment, after an internal investigation into a whistleblower\u2019s allegations of fraud. KKR said the probe uncovered evidence that Aceco made payments to people involved in Brazil\u2019s gargantuan \u201cCar Wash\u201d bribery and corruption scandal, some linked to the 2014 World Cup. Nitzan denied any involvement in fraud, saying KKR simply regretted an ill-fated investment made just before Brazil plunged into a deep recession. While Barclays was not part of any deals involving Aceco, Staley became involved in the row in a personal capacity after a company owned by Nitzan bought a tranche of Aceco debt. The deal could have allowed Nitzan to regain control of the company he had sold to KKR, just a few years after the American private equity group had watched its investment dwindle to nothing. A legal dispute between Nitzan and KKR ensued and, according to reports, KKR asked Staley to listen to the findings of its investigation, in the hope he would convince Nitzan to settle. The Barclays chief executive refused to do so and subsequently introduced a friend, Timothy Collins of New York firm Ripplewood Advisors, to Nitzan as a potential investor. KKR later learned that Staley had also discussed the Aceco affair with two of KKR\u2019s co-investors in the company, the Texas Teacher Retirement System and Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund GIC, telling them he did not believe Nitzan would be involved in fraud. Alexander Navab, KKR\u2019s private equity chief for the Americas, is understood to have called Staley to ask why he was aiding Nitzan despite serious allegations of fraud that affected KKR. Staley argued that he was acting in a personal capacity and would continue to defend his brother-in-law. But KKR dismissed the idea that he was acting privately and has accused him of acting against the interests of a Barclays client. Sources familiar with the matter said the conversations between Staley and Navab were \u201cnot friendly\u201d. Barclays declined to comment. But KKR issued a statement saying it had a \u201cresponsibility to protect the interests of our investors who we believe were defrauded in the sale of Aceco\u201d. \u201cWe would also note that we have been a long-time client of Barclays, which comes with its own responsibilities for Barclays,\u201d a spokesperson added. KKR, which has paid Barclays $190m in fees since 2010 according to Dealogic, is understood to have barred Barclays from taking part in certain deals and will continue to do so until the dispute is resolved. The private equity group has also yet to rule out making a formal complaint about Staley to the Barclays board or its chairman John McFarlane. Staley is already facing a regulatory investigation, a pay cut and a potential investor revolt, after he admitted trying to unmask a whistleblower who made allegations about a long-term associate he had brought to the bank. The American twice attempted to use Barclay\u2019s internal security team to track down the authors of two anonymous letters, which he said were an effort to \u201cmaliciously smear\u201d Barclays executive Tim Main. The letters are understood to have contained allegations about the previous conduct of Main, who worked with Staley at US bank JP Morgan and was then recruited to Barclays in a senior role last June.",

admits he 'made a mistake' over whistleblowing case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The chief executive apologised last month after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/10/barclays-boss-jes-staley-may-lose-bonus-over-bid-to-expose-whistleblower\">admitting that he asked Barclays\u2019 internal security team</a> to unmask a whistleblower, who had made accusations against an ex-colleague Staley recruited from his former employer JP Morgan.</p> <p>The latest dispute, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-barclayss-jes-staley-went-to-bat-for-an-in-law-a-powerful-client-cried-foul-1493717418\">revealed in the Wall Street Journal</a>, relates to Aceco, a Brazilian technology company founded by the family of Staley\u2019s wife Debora Nitzan Staley.</p> <p>She and her brother Jorge Nitzan sold their stakes in Aceco to KKR in a 2014 deal that valued the company at $700m (\u00a3542m) and is said to have made the siblings $240m between them.</p> <p>The deal was KKR\u2019s maiden direct investment in Brazil but went sour in 2015 when the private equity giant fired Nitzan, then Aceco\u2019s chief executive, and wrote off its $475m investment, after an internal investigation into a whistleblower\u2019s allegations of fraud.</p> <p>KKR said the probe uncovered evidence that Aceco made payments to people involved in Brazil\u2019s gargantuan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/15/brazil-corruption-investigation-list-politicians-michel-temer\">\u201cCar Wash\u201d bribery and corruption scandal</a>, some linked to the 2014 World Cup.</p> <p>Nitzan denied any involvement in fraud, saying KKR simply regretted an ill-fated investment made just before Brazil plunged into a deep recession.</p> <p>While Barclays was not part of any deals involving Aceco, Staley became involved in the row in a personal capacity after a company owned by Nitzan bought a tranche of Aceco debt.</p> <p>The deal could have allowed Nitzan to regain control of the company he had sold to KKR, just a few years after the American private equity group had watched its investment dwindle to nothing.</p> <p>A legal dispute between Nitzan and KKR ensued and, according to reports, KKR asked Staley to listen to the findings of its investigation, in the hope he would convince Nitzan to settle.</p> <p>The Barclays chief executive refused to do so and subsequently introduced a friend, Timothy Collins of New York firm Ripplewood Advisors, to Nitzan as a potential investor.</p> <p>KKR later learned that Staley had also discussed the Aceco affair with two of KKR\u2019s co-investors in the company, the Texas Teacher Retirement System and Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund GIC, telling them he did not believe Nitzan would be involved in fraud.</p> <p>Alexander Navab, KKR\u2019s private equity chief for the Americas, is understood to have called Staley to ask why he was aiding Nitzan despite serious allegations of fraud that affected KKR.</p> <p>Staley argued that he was acting in a personal capacity and would continue to defend his brother-in-law.</p> <p>But KKR dismissed the idea that he was acting privately and has accused him of acting against the interests of a Barclays client.</p> <p>Sources familiar with the matter said the conversations between Staley and Navab were \u201cnot friendly\u201d. </p> <p>Barclays declined to comment.</p> <p>But KKR issued a statement saying it had a \u201cresponsibility to protect the interests of our investors who we believe were defrauded in the sale of Aceco\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe would also note that we have been a long-time client of Barclays, which comes with its own responsibilities for Barclays,\u201d a spokesperson added.</p> <p>KKR, which has paid Barclays $190m in fees since 2010 according to Dealogic, is understood to have barred Barclays from taking part in certain deals and will continue to do so until the dispute is resolved.</p> <p>The private equity group has also yet to rule out making a formal complaint about Staley to the Barclays board or its chairman John McFarlane.</p> <p>Staley is already facing a regulatory investigation, a pay cut and a potential investor revolt, after he admitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/apr/10/barclays-boss-investigated-over-attempts-to-unmask-whistleblower-live\">trying to unmask a whistleblower</a> who made allegations about a long-term associate he had brought to the bank.</p> <p>The American twice attempted to use Barclay\u2019s internal security team to track down the authors of two anonymous letters, which he said were an effort to \u201cmaliciously smear\u201d Barclays executive Tim Main.</p> <p>The letters are understood to have contained allegations about the previous conduct of Main, who worked with Staley at US bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jpmorgan\">JP Morgan</a> and was then recruited to Barclays in a senior role last June.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, ends up losing his job over the whistleblower affair, he\u2019ll deserve no sympathy. In the post-crisis era, attempting to unmask a whistleblower is a serious offence for a bank boss. It doesn\u2019t matter if Staley thought the informant was making an unfounded and malicious attack on Tim Main, a recent senior recruit to Barclays\u2019 investment bank. The critical thing is for the chief executive to respect the whistleblowing process by staying out of it. It is staggering that Staley, whether he was badly advised or not, could have made such a mistake. The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, is investigating and its judgment is keenly awaited. In the meantime, however, one can feel some sympathy for Staley in the unrelated matter of the complicated saga of Aceco, a Brazilian data-centre company that used to be part-owned by Staley\u2019s wife and her brother. On this one, Staley seems to done nothing of substance wrong. It looks like he\u2019s being unfairly kicked by KKR, a firm that ought to know better. The chronology is messy, naturally. Staley\u2019s wife banked $160m (\u00a3124m) when private equity giant KKR bought Aceco in a $700m deal in 2014. Aceco\u2019s value then quickly evaporated and KKR wrote the value of the business down to zero. From outside, it is impossible to know if the disaster for investors was caused by fraud within Aceco, as KKR alleges in a legal claim, or just a downturn in the Brazilian economy. Yet KKR\u2019s chief grumble with Staley relates to subsequent events \u2013 it seems to think he was somehow at fault in the attempt by his brother-in-law, Jorge Nitzan, to regain control of Aceco by buying slices of its debt. Yet this claim, on the evidence so far, boils down to very little. Staley spoke of Nitzan\u2019s good character to two of KKR\u2019s co-investors in the Aceco deal. So what? He\u2019s allowed to offer an opinion in a matter in which Barclays had no role. The other allegation is that Staley encouraged an old friend to invest in Aceco\u2019s debt alongside Nitzan. But the details of that supposed interference are sketchy and, in any case, the investment didn\u2019t happen. Staley should probably have kept out altogether, and not exposed himself to any appearance of taking sides in other people\u2019s commercial dispute. But one can\u2019t conclude that he\u2019s compromised his own position or that of Barclays. KKR, on the other hand, seems to think Staley owed it favour because it shovels work towards the bank he leads. Thus it issued a pompous statement reminding Barclays of its \u201cresponsibilities\u201d and threatening, but never quite saying, that it will withhold business. Sorry, chaps, but Staley was under no obligation to help KKR. The story, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, offers a fascinating glimpse into how the gloves come off when serious money goes down the drain. But the simple truth at the heart of the tale is surely that KKR should fight its own legal battles. Barclays\u2019 board, regardless of whether Staley survives the whistleblowing fallout, would be entitled to tell the private equity tycoons to take their business elsewhere if they feel differently. If Barclays\u2019 chief executive is to be ousted, let it be for the right reason. Standard Life and Aberdeen too eager with the golden handcuffs? It is easy to understand why Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management, when they merge, would need to shell out a few million quid to fund managers whose services will no longer required. One of the aims of the deal is to reduce costs by \u00a3200m, and, since fund managers are one of the biggest overheads, a few will have to go. That\u2019s what happens when investment departments combine and contractual obligations must be met. It\u2019s harder, however, to see why \u00a335m needs to be spent on retention payments, or persuading the remainers to remain. Those folk will still be doing their jobs, and in some cases could be given bigger roles, which would mean a pay rise. They are the gainers from the merger. What\u2019s more, if the trusted hands believe the arguments from the boardrooms that Standard and Aberdeen can achieve bigger and greater things in combination, they would presumably welcome the long-term career opportunities. The line from the merger partners is that the retention payments are really protection against opportunistic poaching by rivals. It would be bad for business if too many fund managers jumped ship in the middle of a drawn-out merger, thus \u00a335m is seen as a relatively cheap form of insurance in a \u00a312bn deal. Well, maybe, but there\u2019s more than a whiff of self-serving justification here. The best fund managers, we are often told, are never motivated solely by money and love the intellectual challenge of the investment game. Retention payments seem to have become the norm because shareholders are too timid to question them.",
