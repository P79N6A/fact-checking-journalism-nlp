      "bodyText": "Worldpay is the payments processor that escaped from the wreckage at Royal Bank of Scotland to become a member of the FTSE 100 index. Ignore the memory that RBS sold for \u00a32bn in 2010. Worldpay has enjoyed heavy investment since then and its marketplace has boomed. The real question is whether a \u00a39.3bn takeover by US firm Vantiv is another instance of unambitious British management selling out cheaply. The short answer is yes, it is, with a couple of qualifications. Worldpay is plainly correct to say that consolidation is happening at speed in its industry. Deals seem to arrive every week. Greater size, in theory, provides scope for savings ($200m, say the duo), and bigger investment budgets to ride the e-commerce wave. And Vantiv is a reasonable marriage partner. It is one of the big players in the US, where Worldpay\u2019s venture has spluttered. Thanks to the UK firm\u2019s presence in 140 countries, the combo will be a true global operator. Yet two big problems with this deal remain, and neither is wholly addressed by revisions to the sketchy structure presented a month ago. The first is price. Vantiv is offering 397p, comprising 55p in cash plus shares. The terms are unchanged but, thanks to a share buy-in by Vantiv in the interim, Worldpay shareholders will end up with 43% of the new company, up from 41%. Every percentage point counts, but it\u2019s hard to shake the sense that Worldpay could have negotiated harder. The City\u2019s original definition of a knockout price was close to 500p, not 400p. Vantiv will adopt a secondary listing in London, making it easier for true UK believers to stay invested, but that\u2019s a minor consolation for a miserly takeover premium of 22.7%. The second problem is that, by rights, one would like to see more Worldpay managers on the new board. Theirs is the business with greater momentum and superiority in online technology, as opposed to old-fashioned point-of-sale terminals. There is half a concession. Worldpay will get five out of 13 directors, instead of four, but there is still the cosmetic silliness of its boss, Philip Jansen, being a \u201cco-chief executive\u201d who reports to the real chief executive, Vantiv\u2019s Charles Drucker. The worry is that over time, Worldpay\u2019s UK identity will be eroded. Therein lies the real regret. If the deal had been done in early 2016, after the first discussions, Worldpay would have been the bigger partner. Sir Mike Rake, Worldpay\u2019s chairman, has said the post-Brexit plunge in the pound \u201ckilled\u201d the plan to be an industry predator. That\u2019s one way to view things, but it feels too timid. Alternatively, Worldpay\u2019s board could have reflected on the solidity of a 39% share of the UK payments market, and the enviable reach outside the US, and fought its way back to negotiating strength. This is not the worst deal in the world for Worldpay \u2013 but it could have been better. Lessons from L&amp;G By way of inspiration, Rake &amp; co could look at a different sector and the progress of Legal &amp; General. From a standing start a decade ago, the UK insurer has gathered $160bn of assets in the US, which is about 13% of the \u00a3950bn it now has under management. L&amp;G\u2019s share of individual US markets, everything from life insurance to pension transfers, is tiny by comparison with the UK. But that suggests that prospects for replicating the UK model in the US remain strong. Back in the UK, Brexit is panning out as chief executive Nigel Wilson predicted, with minimal effect on the business despite \u201csome structural weakness in the UK economy\u201d. Overall, operating profit improved 27% to \u00a3988m in the first half of 2017. In retrospect, the post-referendum panic in L&amp;G\u2019s shares was a wonderful opportunity to back a firm that preaches a long-termist gospel. The shares hit 171p then; now they\u2019re 272p. Conflicts officer Here\u2019s a thankless role for somebody at the Bank of England: conflict of interest officer. It\u2019s a bit like being the fire marshal, except you have to tick more boxes and don\u2019t get to wear a luminous jacket. After the rumpus over Charlotte Hogg\u2019s exit as deputy governor \u2013 she failed to tell the bosses about her brother\u2019s job at Barclays \u2013 the Bank had to come up with something. A new system in which potential conflicts are assessed centrally does indeed sound like an improvement. In the end, though, any system requires individuals to use common sense \u2013 reveal every personal relationship at the outset, even if it doesn\u2019t feel problematic. Hogg\u2019s downfall, one hopes, will have delivered that message more effectively than a conflict officer ever will.",

      "bodyText": "The latest housing finance figures reveal that the housing boom might be coming to an end as investors disappear from the market but it appears that the market will need to cool for a while longer before first-home buyers will be able to return in force. Figures released this week by the Bureau of Statistics reveal that, over the past six months, the growth of housing finance has stalled. The drop off in the growth of housing finance was rather sudden \u2013 after going backwards during 2015, housing finance grew strongly in 2016, reaching a peak monthly growth in October of 1.6%. But, in the first six months of this year, housing finance has never grown by more than 1% in any month: The main reason for the slowing has been the retreat of investors from the housing market. In December last year investors accounted for 49.3% of all housing finance \u2013 by June this had fallen to just 45.8%: In the first six months of this year the value of investor housing fell 6%. But the market hasn\u2019t fallen hard. The signs are there that the hoped for \u201csoft landing\u201d is occurring. While investor finance has fallen, the value of owner-occupier finance has continued to grow \u2013 up 7% in the first half of this year: The slowing of housing finance is a clear sign that the housing market itself should begin to cool. There is a quite solid link between the annual growth of finance and the growth of house prices in six months\u2019 time: These figures suggest the growth of house prices across Australia on average should continue to rise for another three to six months before slowing towards the end of the year. That\u2019s good news for those looking to get into the housing market, especially in Sydney. While in New South Wales the number of people taking out housing finance continues to grow, the value of that finance is not growing anywhere near the levels it was in 2015: As a general rule, the growth in the value of housing finance rises in line with the number of people taking out mortgages. In the past six months, however, the growth in value has actually been slightly lower than would be expected given the number of mortgages being entered into: The hope is that this will see first-home buyers able to return to the market. Since the end of 2011, when the RBA began cutting rates and set fire to the Sydney housing market, first-home buyers have been shut out. In January 2012, first-home buyers accounted for 19% of owner-occupiers taking out mortgages; now it is 8%. The drop in first-home buyers occurred across the nation \u2013 except for WA \u2013 where, due to the end of the mining boom, house prices have fallen by around 8% since the middle of 2014: The drop in the share of first-home buyers in NSW since 2012, however, is remarkable even compared to the second biggest market of Victoria. Since 2001 Victoria and NSW had had similar shared of first-home buyers but, in 2012, as the Sydney housing boom took off, the percentage of first-home buyers shrank in a manner not replicated in Victoria: While the hope for a soft landing, which does not see a collapse in the housing market (and with it a large section of our economy), the concern is that even a slowing of the market will do little to bring back first-home buyers. Interestingly, since the start of the housing boom, the size of the average mortgage of first-home buyers across all states except Tasmania has increased by less than has the size in the mortgages for non first-home buyers. A look at the average mortgage sizes in NSW shows that in 2013 the average non first-home buyer mortgage of $335,900 was just 4.5% bigger than the $321,500 average mortgage of a first-home buyer. Now, however, the average mortgage of a non first-home buyer in NSW is nearly 20% more than for a first-home buyer: But while the size of mortgages for first-home buyers has stayed steady around $367,000 since the start of 2016, the percentage of first-home buyers in the NSW market has fallen from 9% to 8%. This suggests that the problem is not so much that the prices of houses bought by first-home buyers has risen but that the number of houses first-home buyers can afford has shrunk. It would suggest that there is a ceiling that many first-home buyers hit of which there is not an equivalent for non-first home buyers. So while the market might be cooling, it would seem that first-home buyers \u2013 especially in Sydney \u2013 will be waiting some while before affordability is significantly improved.",

With the jobless rate at its lowest level since the mid-1970s, the regular report compiled by Threadneedle Street\u2019s regional agents found a slight edging up of pay awards. The agents \u2013 who visit businesses regularly and act as the eyes and ears of the Bank across the UK \u2013 said settlements were modest and tended to be in the region of 2-3%. After their last check, conducted in June, the agents said settlements were 2-2.5%. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics indicated annual average earnings growth running at just over 2%, below inflation of 2.6%. The Bank believes that record levels of employment and the decline in unemployment to 4.5% will give workers the bargaining power to push up pay at a time when their living standards are being eroded and has been surprised by the lack of wage inflation recently. In their report the agents said jobs were being created but not at a rapid rate. \u201cOverall employment intentions remained modest,\u201d the report said. \u201cService sector employment intentions reflected the slight pick-up in activity earlier in the year within professional business services. Growth in manufacturing intentions was stable and was dampened by a stronger focus on productivity improvements and automation over job creation. Recruitment difficulties had edged higher, and were gradually broadening across sectors and skill areas. \u201cDespite this, labour cost growth had been modest, with pay awards clustered around 2\u20133%.\u201d The outlook for wages has become central to the Bank\u2019s decision about whether official borrowing costs should be raised from their current record-low level of 0.25%. The August meeting of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) left interest rates unchanged but with two dissenting voices \u2013 Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders. One of the reasons the pair gave justifying a tightening of policy was the expectation that continued jobs growth would put upward pressure on wage inflation. The seven MPC members who supported no change said that, despite positive signs on wage growth, there was not yet enough evidence of a more sustained pick up than that contained in the Bank\u2019s central forecast, which is for average weekly earnings to grow by 2% in 2017, 3% in 2018 and 3.25% in 2019. The agents reported said that while the cost of retail goods rose further over the summer as increases in import costs caused by the pound\u2019s weakness fed through, feedback from some businesses suggested that inflation was reaching its peak. Consumer spending growth had slowed slightly further, the agents said. \u201cSome contacts ascribed this to increased caution among consumers and to consumers trading down to cheaper products or brands. Growth in value terms was supported by price inflation with growth weaker in volume terms.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A record number of payments took place by credit and debit cards in June, fuelled by the continued popularity of contactless transactions. UK Finance, the new trade body for the banking industry, said almost 1.4bn card payments were made during the month. The 12% increase was the biggest annual growth in the number of payments since June 2008. The data follows recent figures from the British Retail Consortium that found cards now make up more than half of all retail purchases. Contactless cards were introduced 10 years ago and their increasing usage appears to suggest customers have overcome their initial suspicion about tap-and-go payments. In June, a record 34% of card transactions were contactless compared with 33% the previous month. A year ago, UK Finance data showed contactless payments made up around 18% of card transactions. Richard Koch, head of cards at UK Finance, said: \u201cContactless payments accounted for a third of transactions in June with consumers continuing to use their cards for lower-value purchases. While spending recorded a relatively modest monthly growth, the number of transactions rose at a faster rate, with some 46 million card purchases made every day.\u201d Around \u00a357.1bn was spent via cards in June \u2013 up 0.3% on the previous month and 7.2% higher compared with a year earlier \u2013 with \u00a340.6bn via debit cards. But the average transaction value on all card payments fell 16p to \u00a341.36 in June, the lowest level since June 2000, as consumers become accustomed to using cards for smaller-value purchases. A year ago, the average value was \u00a343.53; it peaked at \u00a350.55 in July 2011. The amount of credit card spending was \u00a316.5bn \u2013 around the level it has been at for the past few months \u2013 out of the \u00a357.1bn total. Credit card lending is one part of the consumer credit market \u2013 which includes personal and car loans \u2013 that is being closely watched by regulators. The Bank of England\u2019s director for financial stability, Alex Brazier, recently warned lenders were \u201cdicing with a spiral of complacency\u201d and that lending standards \u201ccan go from responsible to reckless very quickly\u201d. Last month, Bank data showed that unsecured consumer lending, which includes credit cards, overdrafts and car loans, grew by 10% in the year to June. The figures showed the total had reached almost \u00a3201bn, topping \u00a3200bn for the first time since the global crisis in 2008.",

Morrisons announced its intention after a 70% of adults said in a survey by the company they objected to the use of fictitious farm brands and only wanted genuine place or farm names on packaging and branding. The Bradford-based grocer dropped a brand called Hemsley\u2019s \u2013 a play on the real North Yorkshire town of Helmsley \u2013 more than a year ago. The retailer is urging shoppers to visit stores to meet real farmers who will explain the benefits of UK-grown food. The Morrisons survey found 46% of respondents had never met a farmer, while 52% said they did not know how the food they buy was grown. According to the Office for National Statistics, 83% of the UK population live in urban areas. The NFU and the Soil Association have condemned fake farm brands as misleading for consumers and insulting to farmers. The most high-profile example was in March 2016 when Tesco, the UK\u2019s largest retailer, launched seven brands \u2013 including Woodside Farms and Boswell Farms \u2013 based on British-sounding but fictitious names. Some foods were imported from overseas but given British names to make them sound local. In April, Asda relaunched its value Smart Price food range as Farm Stores, reigniting the row.

Nervous trading marked the 10th anniversary of the start of the financial crisis on Wednesday, following Donald Trump\u2019s warning that North Korea faced \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d if it continued to make threats against the US.

The FTSE 100 ended 44.67 points lower at 7498.06. But the prospect of hefty losses on Wall Street stocks was averted when US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said there was \u201cno imminent threat of war\u201d and that Americans could \u201csleep well at night\u201d.... More here: After a tense, and sometimes sodden day, London\u2019s stock market has closed for the day. Fears over North Korea wiped 0.6% off the blue-chip FTSE 100, with banks and mining companies among the fallers. There were steeper losses in Europe, though, with the French CAC losing 1.3% and Germany\u2019 DAX down 1.1% Markets did recover from their lowest points, after US secretary of state Rex Tillerson told Americans they could sleep safely. But investors are still nervous, as Joshua Mahony of IG says: European stocks have stabilised after this morning\u2019s fear-fuelled deterioration in response to heightened fears of a US-North Korea conflict. Although the stock markets have regained some ground, concerns clearly remain over the potential of conflict, with US yields hitting a six-week low and gold and JPYUSD hitting near two-month highs. David Madden of CMC Markets reckons markets could remain edgy until the crisis is resolved. European stocks have suffered greatly today as traders were prompted to cut-and-run due to the escalating tensions between the US and North Korea. The stand-off between the two countries has encouraged dealers to dump stocks and seek safe haven investments like gold. While the two nations are at loggerheads, it is going to be difficult to imagine money flowing into stocks. Over in America, Wall Street is still in the red, with safe-haven stocks in demand. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently down 50 points, or 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has lost 0.5%. On that note, it\u2019s time for a break - but I\u2019ll be back if anything dramatic happens... GW There aren\u2019t many precedents, fortunately, for how the financial world reacts to the threat of nuclear destruction. The best example is 1962, and the Cuban missile crisis. Capital Economics have dug into the data, and report that the early selloff didn\u2019t last long: Although the S&amp;P 500 fell after US President Kennedy announced the discovery of missiles on Cuba, it had more or less recovered its losses before Soviet General Secretary Khrushchev announced six days later that the missiles would be removed from the island. And even the initial fall was very small compared to the declines in US equities earlier that year, which were not connected to the crisis There\u2019s relief in the City that Wall Street hasn\u2019t suffered chunkier losses so far today. European markets are recovering some of their earlier losses, on hopes that the North Korea - US standoff won\u2019t lead to real disaster. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: While the markets pulled back from their lunchtime losses, the US open couldn\u2019t convince investors to put their Trump/North Korea fears to one side. Though the Dow Jones largely managed to avoid the kind of drastic downturn seen by its European counterparts, it still fell 60 odd points after the bell, leaving the index just above the 22000 mark. For most of Trump\u2019s tenure the Dow has left the dollar to deal with the President\u2019s constant policy disappointments, so it will be interesting to see whether today\u2019s drop marks a change in direction for the record-breaking index, or if it is merely a knee-jerk blip exacerbated by an empty economic calendar. DING DING! The New York stock market has opened for the day with some losses, as investors follow Europe and Asia\u2019s lead. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 62 points, as the escalating tensions between America and North Korea loom over the trading floors. That\u2019s a drop of 0.3%, adding to yesterday\u2019s losses after Donald Trump warned North Korea to expect \u2018fire and fury\u2019 if it made any moves against the US. Goldman Sachs have suggested that investors are actually more worried than they\u2019re letting on..... Capital Economics have calculated that the global economy would take a significant hit if armed conflict broke out between the US and North Korea. In a research note published today, they say: The most important impact of a full-scale conflict on the Korean peninsula would be a massive loss of life. But there would also be significant economic consequences. Those consequences include major damage to South Korea\u2019s economy, and a knock-on impact to supply chains around the globe. The technology industry would be particularly hurt, they warn. The war in Syria has led to a 60% fall in the country\u2019s GDP. The most devastating military conflict since World War Two, however, has been the Korean War (1950-53), which led to 1.2m South Korean deaths, and saw the value of its GDP fall by over 80%. \uf0b7 South Korea accounts for around 2% of global economic output. A 50% fall in South Korean GDP would directly knock 1% off global GDP. But there would also be indirect effects to consider. The main one is the disruption it would cause to global supply chains, which have been made more vulnerable by the introduction of just-in-time delivery systems. Months after the Thai floods had receded in 2011 electronics and automotive factories across the world were still reporting shortages. The impact of a war in Korea would be much bigger. South Korea exports three times as many intermediate products as Thailand. In particular, South Korea is the biggest producer of liquid crystal displays in the world (40% of the global total) and the second biggest of semiconductors (17% market share). It is also a key automotive manufacturer and home to the world\u2019s three biggest shipbuilders. If South Korean production was badly damaged by a war there would be shortages across the world. The disruption would last for some time \u2013 it takes around two years to build a semi-conductor factory from scratch. The impact of the war on the US economy would likely be significant, Capital Economics adds: At its peak in 1952, the US government was spending the equivalent of 4.2% of its GDP fighting the Korean War. The total cost of the second Gulf War (2003) and its aftermath has been estimated at US$1trn (5% of one year\u2019s US GDP). A prolonged war in Korea would significantly push up US federal debt, which at 75% of GDP is already uncomfortably high. The losses in the European stock markets are intensifying, as traders brace for further developments. Here\u2019s the latest. Britain FTSE 100: down 62 points, or 0.8%, at 7480 points German DAX: down 182 points, or 1.5%, at 12,109 points French CAC: down 68 points, or 1.7%, at 4029 points Investors aren\u2019t sure if this is a knee-jerk reaction to last night\u2019s war of words between the US and North Korea, or the start of a serious selloff after a string of record highs. Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com says the next few hours could be critical. By the close of the bell tonight we should have a good feel for sentiment one way or another. But as things stand, risk is definitely off the menu and if you-know-what hits the fan then things could turn ugly really quick. This is especially the case given the extent of the recent rally, which means there will be lots of stops resting below market. So, the downward move could gather pace due to technical selling. Money is pouring into US government bonds as New York traders reach their desks and pile into safe-haven assets. This has driven the price of these Treasury bills up, sending the interest rate (or yield) on the bonds down to their lowest levels in six weeks. The US president has weighed in again.... A quick look at the best-performing shares in London shows that investors are preparing for a potential conflict in Korea. Gold producer Randgold and silver producer Fresnillo have both jumped by 3%, following the surge in precious metal prices today. Weapons producer BAE Systems has also rallied, on the prospect of increased military spending on munitions, armoured vehicles and the like. Kathleen Brooks of City Index explains: BAE Systems, the weapons and defence company, has managed to pick up off recent lows, and is 1.5% higher so far on Wednesday. We would expect US defence companies to also fair well on Wednesday with Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrup Gruman potential gainers from the escalating geopolitical situation with North Korea. Here\u2019s our latest explainer: European banks are bearing the brunt of today\u2019s selloff. The sector has fallen by 1.8% today, on track for its worst day in three months. Here\u2019s the answer to this morning\u2019s question about how Brexit is making it harder to regulate the City of London: The financial markets could suffer sharp losses if the US and North Korea don\u2019t calm the situation. So says Stuart Culverhouse, global head of macro &amp; fixed income research at investment bank Exotix Capital: \u201cThe North Korean threat has been present in one form or another for some time, and despite periods of nervousness, markets generally have not tended to focus on it too much. \u201cNow, with the tension between the US and DPRK reaching a level that appears somewhat unprecedented in the last decade, if not longer, the question is whether this time is different. \u201cTime will tell, but markets may look to safe haven assets if things escalate. The best hope is for all parties to return to the negotiating table. More from Rex Tillerson, who is trying to give US citizens some early morning reassurance (it\u2019s almost 7.30am on the East coast): Breaking: America\u2019s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has told Americans not to panic about an imminent attack from North Korea. Although European and Asian stock markets have been hit by North Korean fears today, the US stock market is expected to open fairly calmly. The futures market suggests the Dow will fall by 30 or 40 points, so only a small dip. However the \u2018fear\u2019 index, the VIX, has jumped to its highest level in a month - showing that investors are anxious. North Korea isn\u2019t the only thing worrying investors today Investors are also spooked by reports that a car has ploughed into a group of French soldiers in Paris this morning. Joshua Mahony of IG says geopolitical worries are driving the markets. European markets are trading in the red this morning, as the risk aversion caused by further confrontation between the US and North Korean was exacerbated heightened by another attack taking place in Paris.... A week of low volatility has been hit with an unexpected rush to safe havens as the US-North Korean feud has ratcheted up once more overnight. No sooner had Trump warned of \u2018fire and fury\u2019 in the event of further threats from North Korea, than the breakaway nation responded with exactly just such a threat, announcing plans for a potential attack on the US airbase in Guam. The unpredictable nature of North Korea means it is hard to gauge exactly how likely an attack is, yet given the military power of both nations, there is no surprise we are seeing markets shift out of risk assets and into havens such as the yen and gold. With the height of the 2007 crisis falling 10 years ago, the threat of a nuclear conflict represents the best chance we have of another market crash. Safe money havens such as the Swiss franc have received \u201ca booster shot\u201d from the US-North Korea crisis, says Arnaud Masset of Swissquote Bank. This chart shows how the \u2018Swissie\u2019 is the best-performing major currency against the US dollar today. The Bank of England has also announced it will appoint a \u2018conflicts of interest\u2019 officer. It follows deputy governor Charlotte Hogg\u2019s shock resignation from the BoE this year, after she failed to report that her brother worked for Barclays bank. British companies are finding it harder to recruit staff, according to the latest report from the Bank of England\u2019s agents across the UK. But despite being in shorter supply, workers aren\u2019t getting higher pay rises. That\u2019s disappointing, given the recent jump in inflation. The latest Agents\u2019 summary of business conditions, just released, says: Recruitment difficulties had edged higher, and were gradually broadening across sectors and skill areas. Despite this, labour cost growth had been modest, with pay awards clustered around 2%\u20133%. The BoE\u2019s agents also found that UK companies only have \u2018modest\u2019 hiring intentions right now. Manufacturers are more focused on improving productivity and automating tasks, rather than taking on more staff, they add. Just in: Greece\u2019s inflation rate remained at 1% last month, as the country continues to claw its way out of deflation. The selloff is gathering pace, as worries over potential military conflict between the US and North Korea grips the markets. Britain\u2019s FTS 100 is now down almost 60 points at 7481, a drop of 0.8%, extending its earlier losses. There are losses in France and Germany too, as traders fret that Donald Trump may mishandle the North Korea crisis, with potentially devastating consequences. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains why the City is worried by last night\u2019s comments from Trump and the North Korean side. Rising tensions on the Korean peninsula are nothing new, they have been a staple for investors for several years now, but this flare-up has the potential for a policy misstep, more so because of the inexperience of the person occupying the White House, and a tendency to conduct policy by way of tweet and press conference. This may explain why financial markets have adopted a safety first approach to events over the last twelve hours. Last night\u2019s comments from President Trump that North Korea would face \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d, if they continued to threaten the US along with their attempts to build a nuclear warhead, that could hit the western US, brought an entirely predictable counter response from Pyongyang. The response that the North Korean nation was considering a missile strike on the US base in Guam was the equivalent of a two fingered response to the US President, and there is a danger that this war of words between two leaders with large egos could get out of control. Hindsight\u2019s a wonderful thing, so where should you have put your money 10 years ago as the financial sector began implode? Deutsche Bank has the answers - the American stock market, and high-yielding US debt. You should have kept well away from the Greek stock market, European banks, and oil. Hope that helps... We won\u2019t see a rerun of the 2008 financial crisis according to Sir John Gieve, the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor for financial stability between 2006 and 2009. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see a repeat of what happened 10 years ago because banks have far more capital, there are far more regulations on their liquidity and funding which was a big issue then, and of course they have spent the last 10 years dealing with the problems raised ... so there isn\u2019t the exuberance that we certainly saw then.\u201d Gieve said that debt levels in the UK were more manageable now, but flagged up concerns about the situation in China: \u201cIn the UK and most of the west the debt levels are more manageable now. We\u2019ve yet to see how they will be affected by a return of positive interest rates, because we\u2019ve had 10 years of super expansionist monetary policy and we\u2019ve yet to see how we can get out of that. \u201cThe main debt which threatens a sudden break is probably in the far East and China which has been running a credit binge now for a decade and is showing signs of over extension.\u201d Here\u2019s a neat chart, showing how world stock markets have clawed back their financial crisis losses, but anyone holding bank shares is still nursing losses. Some banks are *still* dealing with the consequences of the crisis. Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, remains under taxpayer control and continues to negotiate with the US department of justice over misconduct in the run-up to 2007. Politicians have failed to obey Churchill\u2019s advice to \u201cNever let a good crisis go to waste\u201d, says Torsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation. Bell writes that there was a great opportunity to reform the economy in the 10 years since the credit crunch, but it has been missed. After the second world war the Attlee government didn\u2019t simply try to undo the damage of the war. From the NHS to our national parks, it used the energy from that cataclysm to build a better Britain. Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal wasn\u2019t simply a response to the Great Depression, but a set of interlocking reforms aiming to build a fairer country. The financial crisis highlighted the big challenge of our time: to ensure the economy delivers for working people. Looking back over the last decade, it\u2019s clear we have far from delivered. With Brexit looming, a lot\u2019s changed in our politics. But when it comes to our economy, things simply haven\u2019t changed anywhere near enough. Jack Lew, former US Treasury Secretary, has been reminiscing about the financial crisis to mark the 10th anniversary of the credit crunch. He told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that in 2008 he was was \u201cquietly advising\u201d future president Barack Obama on how to address the economic and financial crisis. \u201cI\u2019d never seen a situation where every single day numbers were so much different and worse than the day before that you literally had to come back and keep revisiting how much fiscal stimulus would the economy need in order to stimulate a recovery. Lew also warned that memories of the financial crisis may be starting to fade, and people may forget why some key reforms were pushed through. \u201cWe all know that crises will come in the future, what we don\u2019t know is when and how. What Wall Street reform did was for the first time since the Great Depression gave us the ability to have tools where we could deal with an evolving financial system to have the safeguards that we need. Even before this election you saw a great pushback amongst many, saying this has gone too far. I fear that as the memory of the Great Recession and the financial crisis start to dim, some of the simple nostrums about just clearing away regulation, start to take on salience as if the stakes were not so high in 2007/2008. Overnight, the Bank of England has warned that the task of regulating the City after Brexit will put a strain on its ability to police the financial sector. Like to know more? Let us know what you\u2019d like answered and we\u2019ll do the rest.... The rising US-North Korean nuclear tensions have dampened appetite for risky assets like equities and industrial commodities, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. Instead, safe assets like gold, silver, bonds, the Japanese Yen and the Swiss Franc are in demand, he adds. One City worker reports that senior investors are taking steps to protect themselves from the risks of conflict between the US and North Korea PMs are portfolio managers, or someone who manages other people\u2019s money European stock markets are a sea of red in early trading, with the main indices down around 0.5%. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: The geopolitical tensions have prompted a risk off trade amid investors. President Trump\u2019s comments about North Korea have created nervousness and the fear is if the president really means what he said \u201cfire and fury\u201d. The Japanese yen has hit an eight-week high against the dollar, as geopolitical worries hit the Asian markets. That\u2019s significant, as the yen is a classic safe-haven in turbulent times. Today\u2019s moves drove it up to \u00a5109.74, from \u00a5110.37 on Tuesday. Mitsuo Imaizumi, chief FX strategist at Daiwa Securities, says (via Reuters) that North Korea\u2019s threat to attack the island of Guam has spooked traders. \u201cThe market had been complacent for a while regarding headlines from North Korea. So it reacted when the North threatened Guam, \u201cFew participants, however, think that North Korea would actually strike Guam at this juncture. So the impact is likely to fade eventually.\u201d Trump\u2019s warning to North Korea also sparked a late sell-off on Wall Street last night. That meant the Dow Jones industrial average couldn\u2019t hit its 10th record high in a row. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s an old saying in the markets that you should \u201cbuy at the sound of cannons\u201d. Today\u2019s mantra, though, is that you should sell when the president of the United States and leader of North Korea threaten each other with military conflict. Asian shares have been rattled overnight by the news that Donald Trump had told journalists in New Jersey that: \u201cNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and the fury like the world has never seen.\u201d Trump was responding to reports that North Korea had produced a miniaturised nuclear weapon that can be carried on its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). This move raises fears that Pyongyang could launch a pre-emptive attack on the US. As we reported last night: \u201cI don\u2019t have the slightest doubt that the RVs on these missiles are working,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia nonproliferation programme at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. \u201cThat\u2019s done. We\u2019re there. North Korea can put a nuclear weapon on New York City.\u201d North Korea swiftly responded to Trump\u2019s comments, with reports that it was considering attacking the US Pacific territory of Guam, which is a significant US military base. This has a predictably bad effect on the markets, driving money into safe-haven assets such as US government bonds, and out of shares. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index tumbled by 1.5%, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi 200 index lost 1.25% as traders in Seoul watched events nervously. It\u2019s not a full-blown crash, of course, but investors do seem to be concerned by the escalating tensions \u201cMarkets have a mostly consistent risk-off tone overnight,\u201d says Adam Cole of RBC Capital Markets. We\u2019re also expecting losses in Europe today, with the FTSE 100 being called down 35 points. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says: North Korea has been a worry simmering in the background for a long time but with its more advanced weapons and Trump ready to act in the White House, it could bubble over anytime. The threat from North Korea seems to have jolted investors out of their summer slumber. This will also overshadow the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis, which is being marked today. August 9th 2007 was the \u201cday the world changed\u201d when central bankers began pumping money into the system, after French bank BNP Paribas barred investors from accessing money in funds exposed to subprime mortgages industry. That was the formal start of the credit crunch, which let to market mayhem, bank collapses, a global recession and the eurozone debt crisis. We\u2019ll be looking back at what we\u2019ve learned since.

A 50% fall in South Korean GDP would directly knock 1% off global GDP. But there would also be indirect effects to consider. The main one is the disruption it would cause to global supply chains, which have been made more vulnerable by the introduction of just-in-time delivery systems.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A slowdown in the growth in life expectancy for the UK population has increased profits at insurance and pensions firm Legal &amp; General, which said people were dying sooner than it had expected. The century-long improvements in UK life expectancy have stalled in recent years, with experts blaming a range of factors such as rising obesity, dementia, stress, a lack of exercise, alcohol intake, as well as government cuts to health and social spending. L&amp;G\u2019s chief executive, Nigel Wilson, said: \u201cPeople have been dying much quicker than anyone had expected which as a consequence ... gives us extra cash.\u201d The drop in life expectancy means life insurers need to set aside less cash for pension payments. As a result, L&amp;G, which manages pensions for 1.1 million people, was able to release \u00a3126m of reserves it had held back to pay customers. The company\u2019s profit before tax rose by 41% to \u00a31.2bn in the first half of 2017, beating City forecasts. The insurer will pay a half-year dividend of 4.3p a share, an increase of 7.5%. On the flipside, Wilson said, rising mortality rates mean the company has to pay out on life insurance policies earlier. He was not sure what the net effect on the industry would be, and described the slowdown in life expectancy improvements as \u201cmixed news\u201d. The picture is similar in the US. Alan Devlin, an analyst at Barclays, said: \u201cDeath and taxes are the only two things certain in life and the UK life insurance sector is benefiting from longevity trends not being as onerous as once expected.\u201d An L&amp;G spokeswoman said the company had changed its assumption for current mortality rates but had not made any changes to its \u201cimprover tables\u201d \u2013 its longevity assumptions for the future. \u201cIf we were to adjust them, we\u2019d have to have lots and lots of evidence that it is more than just a few blips,\u201d she said. If those long-term longevity assumptions were changed, Devlin said L&amp;G could benefit from further cash releases of \u00a3250m over the next year and a half. Steve Clayton of Hargreaves Lansdown said: \u201cL&amp;G says the situation is still under review, but there could be more to come if longevity assumptions really are too high. With over \u00a345bn of risk relating to longevity on the books, this could ultimately be very meaningful for L&amp;G.\u201d Life expectancy in the UK has been rising since the end of the first world war. Reasons included people stopping smoking and the emergence of cures or effective treatments for certain diseases. In 1919 men in the UK lived for an average of 52.5 years and women for 56.1 years. UK life expectancy then continued rising steadily to 78.7 for men and 82.6 for women in 2010. However, since then the rate of growth has slowed. In 2015, average life expectancy in Britain was 79.6 years for men and 83.1 years for women, according to the Office for National Statistics. Until 2010, life expectancy in the UK had increased by an extra year every five years for women and every three and a half years for men. However, since then the growth has slowed, taking insurers by surprise. Women now only gain an extra year after a decade while it takes men six years to achieve that gain. Sir Michael Marmot, a former government adviser, published a study of life expectancy last month that linked the slowdown to the austerity measures introduced by David Cameron\u2019s coalition government from 2010, reducing public sector spending. But the Department of Health played down Marmot\u2019s findings. A spokesman said: \u201cLife expectancy continues to increase, with cancer survival rates at a record high while smoking rates are at an all-time low. We continue to invest to ensure our ageing population is well cared for, with \u00a36bn extra going into the NHS [in England] over the last two years and an additional \u00a32bn for the social care system.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Worldpay, the UK\u2019s largest payment processing company, has agreed to a \u00a39.3bn takeover by US rival Vantiv after reassuring MPs that the deal did not amount to post-Brexit \u201ccheap pickings\u201d for a foreign buyer. A spokesman for the UK company said it had contacted senior politicians to explain the strategic rationale behind the deal, amid concerns that the fall in sterling since 2016 was turning prime British assets into bargains. Ron Kalifa, vice-chair of Worldpay, said the firm had sought to reassure UK politicians about the sale. \u201cWe have had several conversations with senior members of parliament to make sure they understand the strategic rationale,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not ready [to do the deal] last year when the pound was in a different position. Letting this opportunity pass by [now] would have been the worst decision for shareholders, customers and staff.\u201d When the takeover talks were first announced last month, Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats and former business secretary, said the transaction represented \u201ccheap pickings\u201d. Days later, Worldpay\u2019s chairman, Sir Mike Rake, said the pound\u2019s slump had \u201ckilled\u201d the company\u2019s hopes of leading consolidation in the sector. Other examples of UK companies bought by foreign firms in the wake of the Brexit vote include Cambridge-based Arm Holdings, which was purchased by Japan\u2019s SoftBank for \u00a324bn in July last year, and the engineering group WS Atkins, which was bought by Canada\u2019s SNC-Lavalin for \u00a32.1bn in April. The pound has fallen 12% against the dollar since the EU referendum and is trading at around $1.30. Worldpay said on Wednesday that it was recommending an offer by Vantiv of 397p a share \u2013 against a closing price of 388.65p \u2013 valuing the company at \u00a38bn. Vantiv will also pay \u00a31.3bn to cover debts. The combined group will be renamed Worldpay and headquartered in Cincinnati, where Vantiv is based. It will have a primary listing on the New York stock exchange and a secondary listing in London. The deal was announced on 5 July but it has taken a number of weeks for the two management teams to reach agreement on the details, including the guarantee of a London listing. The capital will become the international headquarters of the new group. Kalifa said negotiations took time because of the scale and complexity of the deal. \u201cIt will have a \u00a322bn enterprise value on a combined basis so there is a lot to work through.\u201d Worldpay said outside the US there was little overlap with Vantiv. It did not give formal guarantees that UK jobs would be protected, but Kalifa said the deal was about creating growth and not cutting costs. If job cuts did occur in Britain they would be \u201cnegligible\u201d, he added. The company has about 5,000 staff in London, Manchester, Cambridge and Gateshead. Worldpay handles 40% of card payments at tills in Britain and operates in a rapidly growing industry, as more people pay in shops and online by card. The rise of contactless cards has accelerated the trend, becoming a popular payment method for lower-value transactions that were traditionally dominated by cash. The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval and, if it goes ahead, Worldpay shareholders will own 43% of the new business; Vantiv investors will own the remaining 57%. The group expects to generate cost savings of about $200m (\u00a3154m) a year following completion of the deal, partly because of the overlap in the US. Vantiv will dominate the board with eight members, compared with five from Worldpay. The combined group will be led by Vantiv\u2019s Charles Drucker, who will take on the role of executive chair and co-chief executive. Worldpay\u2019s current boss, Philip Jansen, will be co-chief executive, reporting to Drucker. Sir Michael Rake, chairman of BT and former Barclays deputy chairman, will continue at the merged group in the role of lead director, the US equivalent of a senior independent director in the UK. Launched in 1989, Worldpay was previously owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, which sold the business in 2010 to private equity firms Advent and Bain Capital as part of the terms of the bank\u2019s 2008 taxpayer bailout. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2015. Kalifa said Vantiv was a natural partner for Worldpay. \u201cVantiv was owned by a bank, sold to private equity and then floated. Ultimately we\u2019ve come from the same kind of stable so this makes sense.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Alistair Darling has revealed his \u201cmost scary moment\u201d of the financial crisis, which began a decade ago. The former Labour chancellor of the exchequer said he received a shocking phone call from Royal Bank of Scotland in 2008, revealing a run on the bank. He told the BBC: \u201cI had to go to one of these meetings of European finance ministers, and I was asked to come out and take a call from the then chairman of RBS [Tom McKillop], who said the bank was haemorrhaging money. \u201cRemember this was not only the biggest in the world, it was about the same size as the entire UK economy. \u201cI said to him: \u2018How long can you last?\u2019 And what he said to me shook me to the core. He said: \u2018Well we\u2019re going to run out of money in the early afternoon.\u2019\u201d Lord Darling said there would have been \u201cblind panic\u201d had the government not intervened. RBS was bailed out by taxpayers later that year, and the government still owns a 71% stake in the bank. He added that the biggest danger regarding a future crisis was complacency. \u201cIn a few years\u2019 time, when institutional memories start to fade and the people around have all gone and retired, then that\u2019s where the risk occurs,\u201d he said. Wednesday marks the 10th anniversary of the decision by BNP Paribas to suspend three of its funds with major exposure to bonds backed by US sub-prime mortgages. The French bank said at the time it was unable to place a value on them because the market for these products, or \u201csecurities\u201d, had dried up. Jack Lew, the former US Treasury secretary and an adviser to Barack Obama during the financial crisis, recalled the intensity of the situation as it unfolded. \u201cI\u2019d never seen a situation where every single day numbers were so much different and worse than the day before that you had to come back and keep revisiting how much fiscal stimulus the economy would need in order to stimulate a recovery,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said there was a danger in the US of an emerging resistance against tougher banking regulations introduced in the aftermath of the crisis, as memories of the turmoil begin to dim. \u201cOne thing I worry about is that the memory of the financial crisis, as we approach the 10-year mark, is starting to fade a bit. \u201cWe all know that crises will come in the future, what we don\u2019t know is when and how. What Wall Street reform did was for the first time since the Great Depression gave us the ability to have tools where we could deal with an evolving financial system to have the safeguards that we need. Even before [the US presidential] election you saw a great pushback among many, saying this has gone too far.\u201d He said it would be difficult to predict how a future crisis might unfold. \u201cThe risks of the future are unlikely to come from the precise places that they\u2019ve come in the past. In a rapidly evolving financial system new risks can develop out of things that don\u2019t appear initially, that don\u2019t appear to contain that kind of possibility.\u201d Meanwhile, Sir John Gieve said there would be no rerun of the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor for financial stability between 2006 and 2009 told Today: \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see a repeat of what happened 10 years ago because banks have far more capital, there are far more regulations on their liquidity and funding which was a big issue then, and of course they have spent the last 10 years dealing with the problems raised ... so there isn\u2019t the exuberance that we certainly saw then.\u201d He said debt levels in the UK were more manageable than a decade ago, but flagged up concerns about China. \u201cIn the UK and most of the west the debt levels are more manageable now. We\u2019ve yet to see how they will be affected by a return of positive interest rates, because we\u2019ve had 10 years of super-expansionist monetary policy and we\u2019ve yet to see how we can get out of that. \u201cThe main debt which threatens a sudden break is probably in the far east and China which has been running a credit binge now for a decade and is showing signs of over-extension.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England deputy's Brexit warning is strong stuff | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sam Woods isn\u2019t beating about the bush. The deputy governor of the Bank of England and head of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) says practical complexities arising from Brexit pose \u201ca material risk to our objectives\u201d and \u201cwe may have to make some difficult prioritisation decisions\u201d. This is strong stuff. Central bankers tends to prefer qualification and nuance. Woods couldn\u2019t be clearer in describing why a transition period is needed to make the Brexit process orderly, at least in financial services. It would be wrong to dismiss the warning as special pleading for more money, or even as a \u201ctold you so\u201d whinge from Threadneedle Street about the dangers of the UK leaving the European Union. Woods was precise on details. First, there are there dangers for financial stability if services fragment and it becomes harder for banks and other firms to hedge risks. That would affect the other 27 EU countries, as well as the UK. A UK-specific risk would arise in the event of upsets to the economy. Banks would have to be strong enough to keep lending in an environment of \u201chigher loan impairments, increased risk of default and lower asset prices and collateral values\u201d. Second, cross-border insurers sound daunted by the scale of work needed to transfer contracts between entities. Third, the general restructuring of banks and insurers to comply with likely new rules adds scope for confusion. The Bank needs to ensure that its post-crisis supervisory regime isn\u2019t undone by a mass of inter-connected firms that span the UK and EU. Fourth, the Bank will have to authorise and supervise a new collection of firms. There are about 70 non-UK banks incorporated in the European Economic Area that are entitled to accept deposits through a branch in the UK. The checking process will not be a quick job, and does not take account of insurance companies. One can understand why this could be \u201ca material extra burden\u201d on resources. The only encouraging news here is that the Bank, despite the pressures, is not contemplating a huge increase in resources. The sum is about \u00a35.4m, or 2% of the PRA\u2019s budget. The sums will be much larger in other public institutions that are obliged to draw up contingency plans for Brexit. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee, has performed a useful service in extracting Woods\u2019s update on the Bank\u2019s preparations. Other committee chairs could do similarly in their areas \u2013 everything from the NHS to education to border forces is relevant. By the end of such a process, we may discover that the biggest upfront cost of Brexit probably won\u2019t be the divorce bill, which, even if it is \u20ac36bn, will inevitably be paid over a couple of decades. The immediate strain will be on public institutions that have to cover new risks and contemplate their own \u201cdifficult prioritisation decisions\u201d. No wonder chancellor Philip Hammond, already struggling to keep a cap on a public sector payroll where a 1% increase equals \u00a31.8bn, is so keen on a transition period. It won\u2019t just make the process smoother, it will make it cheaper. Indigestion over Standard Life and Aberdeen deal is wearing off It took ages, but shareholders in Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management have decided they like the \u00a312bn merger after all. Back in April, a month after the deal was announced, Standard Life\u2019s shares touched 350p; now they are 442p. Aberdeen\u2019s stock has marched in step, as you would expect in an all-share deal. Perhaps it was the thought of the ridiculous sums disappearing in advisory fees (\u00a397m) and retention payments for fund managers (\u00a335m) that caused the indigestion. In the end, the enthusiasm of the clients is what matters most. They are hard-wired to be suspicious of upheaval, fearing fund managers will take their eye off the ball as their bosses seek to cut \u00a3200m costs. Standard Life\u2019s last set of figures as a standalone company showed few signs of defections but, as chief executive Keith Skeoch conceded, it\u2019s early days. \u201cClients and consultants have taken a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach,\u201d he said. The defections number is one to watch. So \u2013 strange as it sounds \u2013 is the number of chief executives. Skeoch and Aberdeen\u2019s Martin Gilbert intend to perform a double act, an arrangement that is either brave or foolhardy. You won\u2019t find many old City hands who think both men will still be standing two years from now. Wait and see is the correct stance on that front too. Paddy Power Betfair chief is taking ill-advised punt with hasty exit Another day, another 4% off Paddy Power Betfair\u2019s share price. It\u2019s not surprising. First-half operating profits improved by a fifth to \u00a3180m but the rate of revenue growth halved to 9% from a year ago. It\u2019s a bad moment for lauded chief executive Breon Corcoran to decide he\u2019d prefer to do something more interesting. He led last year\u2019s \u00a35bn merger. Skipping off 18 months later is too hasty.",

      "body": "<p>Sam Woods isn\u2019t beating about the bush. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/09/bank-of-england-brexit-strain-regulatory-resources\">The deputy governor of the Bank of England and head of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) says practical complexities arising from Brexit</a> pose \u201ca material risk to our objectives\u201d and \u201cwe may have to make some difficult prioritisation decisions\u201d. </p> <p>This is strong stuff. Central bankers tends to prefer qualification and nuance. Woods couldn\u2019t be clearer in describing why a transition period is needed to make the Brexit process orderly, at least in financial services.</p> <p>It would be wrong to dismiss the warning as special pleading for more money, or even as a \u201ctold you so\u201d whinge from Threadneedle Street about the dangers of the UK leaving the European Union. Woods was precise on details.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/09/bank-of-england-brexit-strain-regulatory-resources\">Bank of England warns Brexit will put strain on regulatory resources</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, there are there dangers for financial stability if services fragment and it becomes harder for banks and other firms to hedge risks. That would affect the other 27 EU countries, as well as the UK. A UK-specific risk would arise in the event of upsets to the economy. Banks would have to be strong enough to keep lending in an environment of \u201chigher loan impairments, increased risk of default and lower asset prices and collateral values\u201d.</p> <p>Second, cross-border insurers sound daunted by the scale of work needed to transfer contracts between entities. Third, the general restructuring of banks and insurers to comply with likely new rules adds scope for confusion. The Bank needs to ensure that its post-crisis supervisory regime isn\u2019t undone by a mass of inter-connected firms that span the UK and EU.</p> <p>Fourth, the Bank will have to authorise and supervise a new collection of firms. There are about 70 non-UK banks incorporated in the European Economic Area that are entitled to accept deposits through a branch in the UK. The checking process will not be a quick job, and does not take account of insurance companies. One can understand why this could be \u201ca material extra burden\u201d on resources. </p> <p>The only encouraging news here is that the Bank, despite the pressures, is not contemplating a huge increase in resources. The sum is about \u00a35.4m, or 2% of the PRA\u2019s budget.</p> <p>The sums will be much larger in other public institutions that are obliged to draw up contingency plans for Brexit. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee, has performed a useful service in extracting Woods\u2019s update on the Bank\u2019s preparations. Other committee chairs could do similarly in their areas \u2013 everything from the NHS to education to border forces is relevant.</p> <p>By the end of such a process, we may discover that the biggest upfront cost of Brexit probably won\u2019t be the divorce bill, which, even if it is \u20ac36bn, will inevitably be paid over a couple of decades. The immediate strain will be on public institutions that have to cover new risks and contemplate their own \u201cdifficult prioritisation decisions\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/01/nicky-morgan-assessment-citys-readiness-hard-brexit\">Nicky Morgan requests assessment of City's readiness for hard Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No wonder chancellor Philip Hammond, already struggling to keep a cap on a public sector payroll where a 1% increase equals \u00a31.8bn, is so keen on a transition period. It won\u2019t just make the process smoother, it will make it cheaper.</p> <h2>Indigestion over Standard Life and Aberdeen deal is wearing off</h2> <p>It took ages, but shareholders in Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management have decided they like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/06/job-losses-likely-standard-life-aberdeen-asset-management-merger\">the \u00a312bn merger</a> after all. Back in April, a month after the deal was announced, Standard Life\u2019s shares touched 350p; now they are 442p. Aberdeen\u2019s stock has marched in step, as you would expect in an all-share deal. Perhaps it was the thought of the ridiculous sums disappearing in advisory fees (\u00a397m) and retention payments for fund managers (\u00a335m) that caused the indigestion.<br></p> <p>In the end, the enthusiasm of the clients is what matters most. They are hard-wired to be suspicious of upheaval, fearing fund managers will take their eye off the ball as their bosses seek to cut \u00a3200m costs. Standard Life\u2019s last set of figures as a standalone company showed few signs of defections but, as chief executive Keith Skeoch conceded, it\u2019s early days. \u201cClients and consultants have taken a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach,\u201d he said. The defections number is one to watch.</p> <p>So \u2013 strange as it sounds \u2013 is the number of chief executives. Skeoch and Aberdeen\u2019s Martin Gilbert intend to perform a double act, an arrangement that is either brave or foolhardy. You won\u2019t find many old City hands who think both men will still be standing two years from now. Wait and see is the correct stance on that front too.</p> <h2>Paddy Power Betfair chief is taking ill-advised punt with hasty exit</h2> <p>Another day, another 4% off Paddy Power Betfair\u2019s share price. It\u2019s not surprising. First-half operating profits improved by a fifth to \u00a3180m but the rate of revenue growth halved to 9% from a year ago. It\u2019s a bad moment for lauded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/07/house-price-slowdown-estate-agents-rises-uk-wages\">chief executive Breon Corcoran to decide he\u2019d prefer to do something more interesting</a>. He led last year\u2019s \u00a35bn merger. Skipping off 18 months later is too hasty.<br></p>",
