Penny stocks may produce profits, but not big ones. If Islam had started with around $15,000 and, in two years, made $200,000 on penny stocks, I could have believed it. Otherwise, he\u2019d have to have been in on \u201cpromotes\u201d \u2013 the penny-stock promoters that some exchanges <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-17/bugatti-driving-26-year-old-tied-to-penny-stock-website.html\">mark with a skull-and-crossbones for their potential illegal behavior</a>. </p> <p>Another problem with penny stocks: many of them took a huge hit during the financial crisis, and if you\u2019re going to make $72m, then every single investment needs to go up. Islam\u2019s insistence that he was in penny stocks would have required every single stock he invested in to rise 1,000% or more. To get a sense of the profitability of penny stocks, consider that if you bought 1 million shares of something trading at 30 cents, it\u2019d be $30k; if it doubled \u2013 an incredible outcome \u2013 it\u2019d only be $60k. That won\u2019t get you to $72m any time soon. </p> <p>And the final problem with penny stocks? They are a market regulators and banks watch closely because there\u2019s so much illegal activity in them. The high level of scrutiny on these trades means Islam would have had to fill out a constant stream of forms, a regulatory burden that wouldn\u2019t have left him a moment to brag. <br></p> <p><strong>Did he pay taxes?</strong> Islam\u2019s story implies he paid no taxes. These trades by definition can\u2019t be long term, so his trades were A) 364 days or under and thus B) were taxed at the much higher ordinary income level, implying that he and his pals really earned well north of $100 million plus--which should raise a red flag for anyone. At the very least, he would have paid taxes of $30m to $40m, which would have drawn the attention of anti-money-laundering units at the IRS and in banks and had regulators crawling all over Islam.</p> <p><strong>No volatility? That makes no sense.</strong> Ever trade an energy stock or a futures contract? Assets that go up in price also go down in price. Not for \u201cBig Mo\u201d Islam, though. Not ever. Generating that level of return would only be possible if what he bought never declined by closing time, if he never booked a meaningful loss to capital.</p> <p><strong>Who was his bank? </strong>Ambitious trading on this scale would require a prime broker \u2013a bank or agent that could extend loans, clear trades and cover losses throughout the day. According to the tale told by young trader, he was the perfect no-risk prime brokerage customer: to make $72m, he couldn\u2019t have lost money, couldn\u2019t have any cost to capital, could never need to put up cash in the middle of the day. But then, he does insist he was in all the right trades. </p> <p><strong>Traders get excited and are full of specifics. </strong>One former trader was surprised by how calm Islam was about his trades, as if they were all expected: \u201cyou don\u2019t just make $72m and keep on going to school.

And $1m would be a sign of genius. Which makes $72m Scrooge McDuck-level unbelievable. So are Islam\u2019s claims that \u201chedge fund guys\u201d wanted to give him $150m. We know a top hedge-fund trader with 15 years of solid experience who has been trying unsuccessfully to raise $75m to start a hedge fund.

      "bodyText": "The Black Friday promotional extravaganza meant Christmas came in November for John Lewis but, despite slower sales in recent days, store chiefs expect a bumper finish to December as shoppers get a second wind. John Lewis\u2019s retail director, Andrew Murphy, predicted that Saturday would kick off a \u201cpretty intense\u201d burst of trade in its stores as Britons packed their shopping into five frenetic days, including Christmas Eve. From sales trends the retailer could see that, as with last year, shoppers were leaving their gift-buying to the last minute, he said. John Lewis rang up sales of \u00a3150.7m in the week to Saturday, just ahead of last year but down nearly 6% on the previous week\u2019s takings. Murphy anticipated trading for this week would also be flattish, but added: \u201cFrom Saturday there will be a second wind and we are expecting it to be pretty intense through to the end of Christmas Eve.\u201d The Black Friday mania that swept the high street at the end of November resulted in John Lewis\u2019s best week of sales in its 150-year history. The retailer sold an unprecedented \u00a3179m worth of goods in the seven days to 29 November as Britons flocked to buy discounted televisions and computers. Murphy said that while the Black Friday week\u2019s haul would be hard to beat, daily records could still fall: \u201cOther than Black Friday, the biggest days are yet to come. With fewer than 10 days to go until Christmas, it\u2019s still all to play for.\u201d While some retailers, including Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer, and parcel carriers struggled to cope with the spike in demand created by Black Friday promotions, John Lewis said its systems and processes had stood up to the test, with click and collect orders up 31%. By comparison, M&amp;S has had to withdraw the option of next-day delivery to its stores and Yodel says their deliveries could be delayed by up to 48 hours. Analysts think Black Friday pulled some Christmas spending forward, and that was reflected in the performance of John Lewis\u2019s electricals department, where the latest figures show sales were down 4% on the previous week. According to the IMRG Capgemini e-Retail Sales Index, which tracks online spending, the promotional event pushed November internet retail sales 22% higher than in 2013, with sales on Black Friday alone surging 135%. \u201cThe mania around Black Friday has clearly driven profound sales results in November,\u201d said Adgild Hop, head of retail consulting at Capgemini. \u201cWe will need to await the December and January results to determine whether this has been truly incremental or merely earlier \u2013 and potentially lower margin \u2013 sales.\u201d Hop added\u201d \u201cIn light of the fulfilment challenges that the industry has suffered post-Black Friday, we will also be holding our breath as to whether retailers can indeed fulfil the increased home delivery and click-and-collect volumes for Christmas. Few things would be more damaging to loyalty than broken promises at this time of year.\u201d",

With fewer than 10 days to go until Christmas, it\u2019s still all to play for.\u201d</p> <p>While some retailers, including Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer, and parcel carriers struggled to cope with the spike in demand created by Black Friday promotions, John Lewis said its systems and processes had stood up to the test, with click and collect orders up 31%.</p> <p>By comparison, M&amp;S has had to withdraw the option of next-day delivery to its stores and Yodel says their deliveries could be delayed by up to 48 hours.</p> <p>Analysts think Black Friday pulled some Christmas spending forward, and that was reflected in the performance of John Lewis\u2019s electricals department, where the latest figures show sales were down 4% on the previous week. According to the IMRG Capgemini e-Retail Sales Index, which tracks online spending, the promotional event pushed November internet retail sales 22% higher than in 2013, with sales on Black Friday alone surging 135%.</p> <p>\u201cThe mania around Black Friday has clearly driven profound sales results in November,\u201d said Adgild Hop, head of retail consulting at Capgemini. \u201cWe will need to await the December and January results to determine whether this has been truly incremental or merely earlier \u2013 and potentially lower margin \u2013 sales.\u201d</p> <p>Hop added\u201d \u201cIn light of the fulfilment challenges that the industry has suffered post-Black Friday, we will also be holding our breath as to whether retailers can indeed fulfil the increased home delivery and click-and-collect volumes for Christmas. Few things would be more damaging to loyalty than broken promises at this time of year.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Plunging oil prices are starting to feed through to UK consumers\u2019 pockets after inflation fell to just 1% for the first time in 12 years last month. The consumer price index is now half the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, largely because the slide in the oil price is being reflected at the UK\u2019s petrol pumps. The last time annual inflation was as low as 1% was September 2002, and it is expected to fall further in the new year to below 1%. Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, described the fall in inflation as an \u201cearly Christmas present\u201d for millions of families. November\u2019s fall was bigger than the City expected, with economists forecasting a drop to 1.2% from 1.3% in October. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, said lower oil prices \u2013 down 40% since June \u2013 were largely positive for consumers and should support economic growth in the UK. He said: \u201cWe should be clear that the 40%-plus drop will flow quickly through to consumers and increase real disposable income and is a net positive for the UK economy.\u201d Average petrol prices were 3p a litre lower in November than in October, compared with a 1.7p fall over the same period last year. Diesel prices fell by 2.9p per litre over the month, following a 1.5p fall a year earlier. Lower air travel costs, food prices and second-hand car prices also contributed to slowing inflation last month, as well as falling prices of \u201crecreational and cultural\u201d goods such as printers, computer games and toys. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said inflation would fall further in the months ahead because of low oil prices, frozen energy bills and a weak inflationary backdrop. He said: \u201cWhile we think that outright deflation will be avoided, it is clear that inflation is set to fall significantly below 1% over the coming months.\u201d Carney narrowly avoided having to write a letter to the chancellor explaining why inflation was so low. The governor is required to write a letter of explanation when inflation is more than one percentage point adrift of the target. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) said in its November inflation report that rate was likely to fall below 1% in early 2015, prompting a letter. The drop in inflation signals some respite for UK households, which have suffered from falling real pay every year since 2008 as inflation outpaced wage growth. Policymakers are hoping that real wages will start to rise consistently in 2015 as inflation remains low and pay growth starts to pick up. In the latest official data for July to September, pay including bonuses grew 1% compared with a year earlier. Excluding bonuses the rate was 1.3%. Low inflation has been one of the factors supporting the Bank of England\u2019s decision to leave interest rates on hold at 0.5%. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said November\u2019s fall in inflation should \u201cput a decisive end to speculation about early interest rate rises\u201d. James Knightley, economist at ING, said: \u201cWe had been thinking that the Bank may hike soon after the general election in May but, given the lack of inflation pressures, a third-quarter move is more probable.\u201d The New Economics Foundation (NEF) thinktank said the sharp fall in inflation last month to 1% masked the differences across the income spectrum, with the poorest hit hardest by rising prices. The NEF said inflation for the poorest 10% of earners in October was 1.25%, while the top 50% enjoyed a lower rate of 0.98%. It said the bias happened because poorer households tended to spend a bigger proportion of their income on essentials such as heating and electricity and had missed out on the falling prices of non-essential items such as recreational goods. James Meadway, senior economist at the NEF, said: \u201cFor the poorest Britons, the standard of living crisis continues, as inflation \u2013 even at these low rates \u2013 is continuing to eat away at their earnings. And with the richer half of society seeing a return to higher income growth, it looks like inequality is once more on the increase.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tumbling oil prices could expose the financial markets to geopolitical risk, create problems in the junk bond market and cause deflation, the Bank of England has warned. In its half-yearly assessment of the dangers facing the financial system, Threadneedle Street said lower oil prices were largely positive for consumers and should support economic growth in the UK and worldwide. But it said there were potential risks to financial stability if the low oil price, down 40% since June, was sustained. Mark Carney, the governor, said: \u201cOverall this is a net positive. The risk around the oil prices only really starts to become material if they breed further contagion.\u201d He said a sustained low oil price could have an impact on US shale oil and gas exploration companies, which might find it more difficult to maintain repayments on their loans. These businesses have issued 13% of all outstanding junk bonds in the US and investors could race to sell off their holdings if they felt repayments were under threat. This could also have a knock-on effect on the wider junk bond \u2013 or high-yield \u2013 market. There are signs that the junk bond market is already being hit by the falling oil price, with measures of risk attached to loans rising last week. The fall in oil prices is in part due to increased shale production in the US, where companies have been funding their activities through issuing debt on the bond markets. Oil prices are at a five-year low following the decision by Opec, the oil producing cartel, not to cut output despite a plentiful supply. The fall in the price of oil is also having a serious impact on the Russian economy, where the rouble is in turmoil, hitting historic lows against the dollar. \u201cA sustained lower oil price also has the potential to reinforce certain geopolitical risks,\u201d the Bank of England said. With the risk of deflation stalking the eurozone, the fall in oil prices could cut expectations for future inflation. \u201cThis in turn could result in slower rates of growth of nominal incomes, increasing the burden of existing debts,\u201d the Bank of England said. But Carney said that the lower oil price was already feeding into lower prices in the UK and. He was speaking just as the ONS had released data showing inflation was at its lowest level for 12 years. The inflation rate was 1% in November after being 1.2% in October and below the 2% target rate for price rises. \u201cWe should be clear that the 40%-plus drop will flow quickly through to consumers and increase real disposable income and is a net positive for the UK economy,\u201d Carney said.",

      "bodyText": "Despite the rouble slumping - even though Russia hiked interest rates from 10.5% to 17% in a vain attempt to support the currency - global markets ended the day higher. In the UK, investors latched onto the low inflation figures, betting that they made an interest rate rate unlikely in the near future. Weak US manufacturing figures had a similar effect, while positive German confidence figures and reasonable PMI data helped support European markets. There was also some optimism after US secretary of state John Kerry said Russia had made some constructive moves towards possible reducing tensions in Ukraine, the situation which prompted Western sanctions on the country. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 149.11 points or 2.41% higher at 6331.83 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 2.46% to 9563.89 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.19% better at 4093.20 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 3.27% to 18,670.05 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.8% up at 10,081.9 Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s presidential poll, the Athens market edged 0.26% lower As for Russia, the rouble is currently at 70/$1, off its worse levels of more than 80/$1 but down on the day despite the rate rise. The dollar denominated RTS index has fallen 12.41%. Meanwhile the oil price - another one of the pressures on the Russian economy - continued to slide, with Brent crude down 1.7% at $60.01 as barrel after earlier falling close to $59. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 107 points or 0.63% higher. And on that note, it\u2019s time to close up after a particularly volatile day on the markets. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Russia faces severe problems whatever the effect of its actions to support the rouble, says Fatom Consulting: If the policy \u2018works\u2019, and the slide in the rouble comes to an end, then a real rate of interest close to 8%, coming on top of a substantial deterioration in Russia\u2019s terms of trade, is sufficient to push the economy into a recession deeper than that observed following the crisis of 1998. If the policy \u2018fails\u2019, and the ruble continues to fall, then the short- term consequences for the real economy are less severe. But another sovereign default becomes almost inevitable. It concludes: The [Russian Central Bank] is caught between a rock and a hard place. If it manages to stop the rot and put a floor under the rouble \u2013 and given the market reaction to last night\u2019s move, that may involve the policy rate of interest going a long way beyond 17% \u2013 then it will be left with a painfully tight monetary policy just as the combined effects of sanctions, and a dramatic fall in the value of its major export, begin to bite. If it fails, and rouble/dollar continues its march towards 100, then default becomes almost inevitable. Sovereign yields have moved sharply higher over the past few days, though at just over 16%, they are hardly priced for default. Equities would suffer in either of our two scenarios. In US dollar terms, the MICEX has fallen around 50% since the summer. That is quite a fall, but it is nothing compared to the declines witnessed back in 1998. The rouble has now recovered some ground, now standing at 69/$1. Not good, given the overnight hike in interest rates to 17%, but not as bad as the level of more than 80/$1 seen earlier. Amid much talk of capital controls in Russia, Reuters has some new snaps: 16-Dec-2014 16:07 - RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER DISCUSSED DIFFICULT SITUATION ON CURRENCY MARKET WITH TOP POLICY MAKERS - RIA NOVOSTI CITES ECONOMY MINISTER 16-Dec-2014 16:08 - CURRENT MARKET SITUATION CALLS FOR SUPPORTING RUSSIAN BANKING SECTOR TO ENSURE STABILITY - ULYUKAYEV 16-Dec-2014 16:09 - CAPITAL CONTROLS NOT DISCUSSED AT MEDVEDEV MEETING - ULYUKAYEV 16-Dec-2014 16:10 - RUSSIAN CENTRAL BANK OVERNIGHT DECISION TO RAISE RATES CAME LATE - ULYUKAYEV Meanwhile the US manufacturing sector grew in December but the growth rate hit an 11 month low. Markit\u2019s preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 53.7 from 54.8 in November, and lower than the 55.2 expected. Chris Williamson of Markit said: Softer output and employment numbers merely represent a cooling in the pace of expansion from unusually strong rates earlier in the year. [But the data] also send a warning light to policymakers that the fourth quarter is likely to see a weakening in the pace of economic growth. So Wall Street too is shrugging off the rouble\u2019s woes, with the data again suggesting the US Federal Reserve will continue to be cautious about any increase in borrowing costs. With the rouble crashing and Russia in crisis, other global markets must be tanking, surely? Actually, no. The FTSE 100 is up around 0.58%, thanks to weak UK inflation figures which hit their lowest level for 12 years and pushed any prospect of an interest rate rise even further into the distance. In Europe, the ZEW German confidence index showed its biggest monthly increase since January last year, while the latest snap purchasing managers indices seemed reasonably stable, given the recent turmoil in Greece and Russia. Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said: This morning\u2019s confidence indicators sent again mixed signals on the state of the Eurozone\u2019s biggest economy. On the positive side, the ZEW index just suggested a new party atmosphere amongst investors with the headline number staging the strongest monthly increase since January 2013. Over the last two months, the ZEW index has increased from a depressive -3.6 in October to 34.9 in December. At the same time, the current assessment component also increased, albeit at a slower pace, from 3.2 in October to 10 in December. Earlier today, however, the latest PMIs were less encouraging. While the sharp increase of the PMI manufacturing (from 49.5 to 51.2) indicated that lower oil prices have finally reached the industry, PMI services continued its downward trend since the summer. The PMI composite dropped slightly to 51.4, from 51.7 in November. Making sense of these diverging signals and indicators is not easy. While the stronger ZEW reading is probably the logical result of lower energy prices and the belief in the healing power of the ECB current measures and, of course, upcoming QE, understanding the PMI remains a mystery. Over recent months, the PMI has failed to show any reliable predictive power. We cannot simply ignore it but until Thursday\u2019s Ifo indicator release, we will store the PMI data in the file labelled \u201cnot important\u201d and go along with the ZEW\u2019s positive mood. So Germany\u2019s Dax is currently up 0.81% while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.28%. Moscow has announced that Dmitry Medvedev has met with a group of top officials, including central bank chief Elvira Nabiullina. Reuters has the details: Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev held a meeting on Tuesday with top central bank and government officials on the country\u2019s financial and economic situation, according to a press release published on the government\u2019s website. \u201cThe meeting was attended by First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, an aide to the President of Russia Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina and First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Government Maxim Akimov,\u201d the government said in the press release. It would not reveal any more details about the meeting. And here\u2019s the official line from Moscow, from Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin: \u201cIt is true that there is turbulence on the market, which can be largely explained by emotions and a speculative mood.\u201d Interfax has published more quotes from Russia\u2019s deputy central bank governor, Sergei Shvetsov. Shvetsov has described last night\u2019s shock interest rate hike, from 10.5% to 17%, as a choice between the \u201cvery, very bad\u201d and the merely \u201cvery bad\u201d. Shvetsov said: The situation is critical. What is happening now we could not have imagined in a nightmare a year ago. But unfortunately we cannot predict the short term perspectives of our financial markets. Many players are in a difficult position thanks to these events. Believe me, the choice that the Central Bank council made yesterday was a choice between the very bad and the very, very bad. What is happening today and in recent days will have various consequences. More here: \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043b \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435 Another newsflash from Moscow \u2013 Kremlin sources are saying the slump in the rouble today was \u201clargely caused by emotions\u201d and a \u201cspeculative mood\u201d. The FT\u2019s correspondent in Moscow, Jack Farchy, is watching the Russian cash machines, and reports that euros are in demand: Shares on Wall Street have dipped at the start of trading, as the Russian crisis and the ongoing oil price slide hits shares. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 75 point, a drop of 0.4%, to 17120. The slump in the rouble could trigger Russia\u2019s downgrade to junk status, warns Timothy Ash, analyst at Standard Bank. Ash says that if the rouble remains around 70/$1 in 2015, then Russia\u2019s GDP in dollar terms would collapse to $1.1trn, from $2.1bn last year. That would \u201cdouble the country\u2019s external debt/GDP ratio to 70%\u201d, he says. A recession, and the cost of recapitalising Russian banks, would also push the Russian budget into deficit. Ash also cites the damage to confidence in Russia\u2019s central bank, the possibility of capital controls, and the danger the geopolitical risks will hit Russia\u2019s \u201cability and willingness\u2019 to repay its debts. Russian bonds have already fallen sharply in recent weeks. so the market has already given its verdict. As Ash puts it: Now you could well argue that Russia is already trading as junk, so no big market impact. Indeed, Russia has enough problems to deal with anyway, and a rating downgrade would be the last of its worries at this stage. Currency exchange offices in Moscow have been left reeling by the dramatic changes in the rouble today. This office widened its buy-and-sell spreads dramatically, and must be relieved that the rouble is now \u2018only\u2019 at 90 to the \u20ac1, having hit 100 briefly: Another operation appears to have thrown in the towel: Russia is being dragged deeper into the mire by the oil price, which continues to fall today. Brent crude has lost another 3% today to $58.91 per barrel, a new five and a half-year low. Economists estimate that Russia needs the oil price to be around $100/barrel to break even. The lower it goes, the more damage is caused to Russia\u2019s finances. Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy reckons oil will destabilise President Putin: \u201cPutin rode the wave of higher oil prices in the years after he came to power, but there is no question that the economics will start to adversely impact the politics,\u201d \u201cThe pieces are falling into place to start to affect the political sustainability of this regime.\u201d Russia\u2019s largest bank, Sherbank, is being battered on the stock market. Shares in Sherbank have tumbled 23% today, as traders react to last night\u2019s massive interest rate hike, to 17%, and the slide in the rouble today. Russia\u2019s central bank will implement more measures to stabilise domestic markets following a rate hike, its First Deputy Governor Sergei Shvetsov said on Tuesday (via Reuters). Shvetsov also called the situation on the Russian foreign exchange and stock markets \u201ccritical.\u201d At pixel time, the rouble is currently hovering around 73 to the US dollar, a 10% slump today. And the main Moscow index, the RTS, is still deep in the red - down 12% today. Just seeing some news flashes from the Russian central bank, on the Reuters terminal: RUSSIAN CENTRAL BANK FIRST DEPUTY GOVERNOR SAYS CENTRAL BANK WILL TAKE MORE MEASURES AFTER RATE HIKE RUSSIAN CENTRAL BANK FIRST DEPUTY GOVERNOR SAYS SITUATION ON FOREX AND STOCK MARKETS CRITICAL There\u2019s no sign of panic on the streets of Moscow, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Jason Corcoran. The Interfax news agency is reporting that prime minister Dmitry Medvedev will hold a meeting on the \u201cfinancial situation\u201d today. Interfax says: Opening the meeting of the government commission on the development of the Far East, the Prime Minister said that after the meeting intends to discuss with colleagues the current situation in the financial markets. \u201cIn financial matters we still get together with colleagues today and talk\u201d, Medvedev said. (translation via Google) Heads-up! The rouble is now strengthening. Having lurched down to the 80/$1 mark, the Russian currency has now re-bounced back to the 72/$1 mark. That\u2019s still a massive decline on the day. It suggests that the Russian central bank may be intervening in the markets, selling dollars and buying roubles to give the battered currency some support. Political analyst Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group flags up that Russia\u2019s crisis cannot be dismissed as a little local difficulty: The cost of insuring Russian government debt against default has surged today to a new five and a half-year high. A five-year Russian credit default swap now costs 656 basis points, a jump of 109bp from yesterday. That means it would cost $656,000 per year to insure $10m of Russian debt. I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no relief for the rouble - the Russian currency just crashed through the 100 mark against the euro, and hit 80 to the dollar. The tumbling rouble puts more pressure on Moscow to impose capital controls, to prevent people withdrawing cash from the banks and taking it out of the country. Luis Costa, a senior analyst at Citi, says: \u201cWe think capital controls as a policy measure cannot be off the table now.\u201d The rouble has also been routed against the euro today, and is on the brink of breaching the 100 rouble to the \u20ac1 mark. Make that 77 roubles to the $1.... Moscow\u2019s stock market isn\u2019t a pretty picture today either. The RTS index of leading shares has slumped by 14% so far today, as the slumping rouble puts more pressure on companies who need to finance debts in foreign currencies. And some companies, such as oil firm Bashneft and airline Aeroflot, have seen more than a fifth wiped off their markets capitalisation. There\u2019s no respite for the rouble, it\u2019s now on the brink of hitting 75 to the $1. Some economists had hoped that last night\u2019s huge interest hike, from 10.5% to 17%, would give the rouble a much-needed boost. Instead, the markets are viewing the hike - which came at 1am Moscow time - as a sign of panic. Daniel Sugarman, market strategist at ETX Capital, says: The sudden shift by the RCB has certainly not done anything to dispel the sense of desperation emanating from Moscow as the Rouble continues its tumble. At 73 roubles to the US dollar, the Russian currency has shed more than 10% today alone. Three months ago, it was trading at below 40 roubles to the $1. Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst at Caxton FX, warns that: Elvira Naibullina and the Russian central bank feel that the rouble is undervalued, but with the price of oil falling and western sanctions continuing to take a toll on economic output, the rouble is in the middle of a currency crisis with no end in sight.\u201d Earlier today Russia\u2019s embattled central bank chief, Elvira Nabiullina, urged Russians to face reality: \u201cWe have to learn to live in a different zone, to orient ourselves more towards our own sources of financing, and to give a chance to import substitution\u201d Russians must get used to new way of life after rouble crash, says bank chief Sheesh, the rouble has now hit 73 to the US dollar. It\u2019s a fullblown rout. The Russian financial crisis is deepening by the minute, as the rouble ploughs into fresh record lows. The rouble has ploughed to a new all-time low of 69 to the US dollar in the last few minutes. Last night\u2019s huge shock rate hike from the Russian Central Bank has failed to shore up confidence in the Russian currency. A spectacular throw of the dice, but it\u2019s not worked... Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, warns that raising rates to 17% will cause fresh pain to the Russian economy. And the tumbling rouble will make it harder for Russian companies to repay foreign dents, Khalaf explains: \u2018The Russian central bank has moved to battle stations to defend its currency. So far the move has not stopped the slide, and it may yet have negative effects on the Russian economy. International investors will remember how the currency crisis of 1998 and subsequent default on sovereign bonds brought Wall Street to its knees, via the exposure of the giant hedge fund, Long Term Capital Management. While the currency has significantly weakened this year, default by the government looks unlikely this time around because Russia has relatively low levels of government debt compared to GDP. Despite this, the Russian economy and companies do face serious problems. Rising interest rates will take a toll on a country which is already on the brink of recession. If the price of oil remains around $60 in 2015, Russia could see economic growth contract by 4.5%, according to the Bank of Russia. Meanwhile some Russian companies will have debts denominated in foreign currencies, which will put them under further financial pressure. Reaction to today\u2019s UK bank stress test results has been flooding in. Here\u2019s a brief selection. Dan Taylor, partner at accountancy firm BDO, points out that the UK has been more stringent than the EU authorities, who tested banks in October. The relative severity of the Bank of England\u2019s latest stress tests are a sign of the new world in which we live. These results should give some assurance about the strength of the UK banking system \u2013 particularly when compared to other banks across Europe\u201d John Thanassoulis, Professor of Financial Economics at Warwick Business School, is concerned that everyone now knows that certain banks must now sell assets: For example the Co-operative bank has now been required to sell a large part of its mortgage book. A forced seller is one who will not receive a good price. \u201cThe second downside is that the reputational damage of doing things of which the Bank of England does not approve will make banks risk averse. Whether this is bad is a question of degree. But if lending costs rise for individuals and businesses in the medium term then the poorest consumers and the small entrepreneurs will be the ones who suffer first. And John Lunn, executive director at transformation consultancy Moorhouse, agrees with Mark Carney that the sector is in better shape than before 2008: \u201cHowever, as the sector continues to rebuild its underpinning foundations, the warning by the Bank of England that rebuilding confidence requires more than focussing on financial resilience is in our view the most important finding. As the industry grapples with Darwinian transformations to the standard operating models, UK banks that are better able to focus both on ensuring operational resilience and innovation through delivering a better customer experience will be the overall winners post the banking crisis. The Bank of England\u2019s press conference to discuss today\u2019s bank stress tests, and the latest financial stability report, is over. Not a humdinger, but there were some interesting lines. 1) Governor Mark Carney tried to calm concerns that the unfolding economic crisis in Russia could rock Britain. He insisted that the City is less exposed today than during the 1998 currency crisis, and argued that Moscow is suffering a unique situation due to Western sanctions. 2) He hailed the recent 40%-plus tumble in the oil price as an unambiguous good thing for the UK economy. 3) The UK inflation rate will fall further from this morning\u2019s 12-year low, Carney predicted. But it\u2019s not a threat to stability, and it won\u2019t force the Bank won\u2019t change its policy stance. 4) Carney said next year\u2019s stress tests will be widened to include more international factors such as emerging markets. Given the unfolding geopolitical and market tensions, it\u2019s a shame this year\u2019s tests weren\u2019t broader.... 5) And Carney said the board of Lloyds should be cautious about restarting paying dividends to shareholders, given its need to continue strengthening its capital reserves. The London stock market has risen since the UK inflation data hit the wires, as traders calculate that interest rates are going to stay low for longer. The FTSE 100 is up 40 points at 6222, up 0.6%. Other European markets are also higher, partly due to a better-than-expected measure of German investor confidence. Back to the surprise drop in UK inflation to a 12-year low of just 1.0%.... Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, says it\u2019s good news: Falling oil prices have helped push inflation to its lowest level since 2002. This is a welcome early Christmas present to millions of families across the country. And, as the Liberal Democrat Treasury Minister, I am determined that the continuing oil price falls will be passed on to consumers as quickly as possible and in full. What would you do about the UK government\u2019s stakes in RBS and Lloyds if you were chancellor of the exchequer in the next government, asks our City editor Jill Treanor. There\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be chancellor after the next election, Carney smiles. He points out that Lloyds is well through its turnaround plan, but doesn\u2019t offer any specific advice. Is the drop in inflation to a 12-year low of just 1.0% a worry, asks James Titcomb of the Telegraph. In terms of financial stability, no, Carney replies. We do expect inflation to fall below 1% in the coming months. I expect to write a letter to the chancellor [explaining why inflation has fallen far from its 2% target] , and our policy position will not change. What\u2019s the biggest threat to the stability of the UK economy? It\u2019s still the housing market, replies deputy governor Sir John Cunliffe. Back to the bank stress tests. Manus Cranny of Bloomberg asks whether the BoE would be happy if Lloyds started repaying dividends. Carney: We looked at each bank\u2019s dividend policy at the start of the stress tests..... Lloyds aren\u2019t paying dividends today, so we simply rolled that forwards when assessing their capital strength. Dividends are a matter for Lloyds\u2019 board... BUT, any decision must be consistent with their continual need to rebuild capital, and they\u2019d need the permission of the Prudential Regulatory Authority before they started paying dividends, Carney adds. As covered earlier this morning, Lloyds only narrowly passed the stress tests, having build up capital this year. Reminder, the press conference is being streamed here (the audio\u2019s been fixed too, thanks!) A question on the eurozone, and whether the European Central Bank should start buying government bonds through a new quantitative easing programme. Mark Carney offers his counterpart at the ECB, Mario Draghi, some support. The ECB is right to be planning to expand its balance sheet, he says. It\u2019s not up to the Bank of England to say how it does it. Europe is the UK\u2019s largest trading partner, so we would welcome measures that would accomplish moving the eurozone back towards its targets. Carney defends the Bank\u2019s decision to rein in the mortgage market this summer, by restricting lenders from making many loans at more than 4.5 times a borrowers\u2019 income. We don\u2019t want large swathes of the population to move to high loan-to-value ratio mortgages, at a time when rates are at record lows. That mistake has been made before.... Are there tensions between the Bank of England and the government over the housing market? The fundamental issue in the UK is a lack of supply, has been for decades, Mark Carney replies. The Bank can\u2019t fix that. The Bank has met its objective, which is to ensure that the banking system can keep lending even if the market crashes. It\u2019s the government\u2019s job to worry about supply, and we\u2019ll all try to deliver sustainable economic growth. Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott asks whether Mark Carney is right to say the UK\u2019s exposure to the Russian crisis is limited. That\u2019s what we thought before the 1998 Russian crisis.... Carney defends himself. In 1998, he argues, the City was more directly exposed to Russian assets -- there were many more assets on the balance sheets of the large interbroker dealers related to Russia. The core linkages in the financial system today are very different than 1998, he says. Carney does point out that the Bank\u2019s survey of risk managers found that geopolitical risk is their top threat. But, he argues we have built extra resilience into the system to cope. Crumbs. The UK inflation rate has fallen to just 1.0% in November, from 1.3% in October. That\u2019s the lowest rate since 2002, and a bigger fall than expected. Kamal Ahmed of the BBC asks how the falling oil price will affect inflation. Oil is still a net positive development, Carney replies. The 40% plus drop in the oil price will flow quite quickly to consumers, it will boost disposable income. And the exposure of the UK economy to the oil industry is managable. It is unambiguously net positive for the UK, he repeats. Onto questions. Sam Fleming of the FT asks: how will next year\u2019s stress tests will consider the growing risks from abroad, such as emerging markets. And what work are you doing about Russia? Carney: This year\u2019s test did consider the impact of a European recession, but no, it didn\u2019t look at emerging markets. Next year\u2019s stress tests will focus more global risks, including emerging markets [a big area for Standard Chartered and HSBC] We are focusing very closely on a range of emerging markets...and markets that appear to be liquid but turn out not to be. On Russia specifically....the UK\u2019s direct exposure to Russia is pretty modest, with a relatively limited direct effect, Carney says. The situation in Russia is somewhat unique -- other countries are hit by the oil price, but few are also facing sanctions, he adds. Since the crisis, authorities around the world have been working to make the financial system safer and better able to cope with shocks, Carney explains. In the UK, banks have raised capital. There is growing confidence in our system, and that appears to be merited. But then he turns to \u2018conduct issues\u2019 - a reference to the various financial scandals that have dogged the financial sector. Strong, effective and well-informed governance is essential, Carney warns. Carney says the stress test gives the Bank of England a better view of the Co-op Bank\u2019s capital needs. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised that it failed. Argh, the audio feed from the Bank of England\u2019s hastily relocated press conference is pretty bad -- reminiscent of the Moon Landing. Amid the squeaks, blips, and outages, Mark Carney is explaining that the main risks to the UK financial sector comes from overseas (a point I flagged up at 7.52am). The Bank of England (delayed) press conference starting now -- it\u2019s being streamed live here. The gloves are coming off in Russia as the rouble hits new lows, tweets our Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker. Oh dear. The Bank of England\u2019s press conference to discuss the bank stress test results, and its financial stability report, has been hit by a power cut. The press pack are being marched down the road to another room with press conference facilities, So it might be a few minutes later than planned (we were due to start at 9am). Back to the UK bank stress tests....and the financial markets appear to be taking them in their stride. Most bank shares are up this morning (Co-op, the only failure, aren\u2019t listed on the stock exchange): Eek. The rouble is now actually DOWN against the US dollar today, despite interest rates being raised to an eye-watering 17% overnight in an attempt to shore up the currency. As fastFT point out, the mood in the Central Bank must be pretty grim this morning. And the Russian stock index, the RTS, is being routed; down over 9.7%. Some market news briefly. Brent crude has fallen through the $60 per barrel mark for the first time since 2009, as the oil price continues to slide. And the Russian rouble has been swirling around on the foreign exchange markets after its central bank stunned the markets by hiking interest rates to 17% overnight. The rouble initially surged around 7%, but has since dropped back against the US dollar. Yesterday it plunged by over 10% before the bank acted. But maybe the hike isn\u2019t working..... Having failed the stress test, the Co-op Bank has agreed a new \u201crevised capital plan\u201d that will see it sell some of its risk-weighted assets. Co-op Bank also insisted that it is making progress to improve its capital position, and is \u201cmuch stronger\u201d than a year ago. Niall Booker, CEO, says: As the regulator notes today, we have achieved the target of building our capital base and the actions we have taken during the first year of our business plan have made the Bank more secure for the benefit of all stakeholders. Our key ratios around capital, liquidity and leverage at the present time are significantly strengthened, we\u2019re ahead of schedule in the disposal of Non-core assets and the stability of our core franchise is improving. However, given we are in the early stage of our plan, the original capital deficit and the nature of our assets, it is no surprise that we have not met the severe stress test hurdle today. But Co-op has also admitted that it will probably not be profitable in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and expects the Non-core division of the Bank to be significantly reduced in size by 2017. Previously, it had hoped that it might return to profitability in 2016. An important point -- the Bank of England said that while the banking system was stronger than the 2008 banking crisis there were still other concerns. \u201cRecent misconduct and other operational failings have highlighted that rebuilding confidence in the banking system requires ore than financial resilience. That, and changes to banks\u2019 business models in response to commercial and regulatory developments, make it important for banks to continue to enhance the effectiveness of their governance arrangements.\u201d Sandy Chen, banking analyst of Cenkos, says he doesn\u2019t see any alarm for Lloyds and RBS in today\u2019s results. He points out, though, that Lloyds hasn\u2019t made any comments about potentially resuming the dividend this morning.... Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, reckons that today\u2019s report should pave the way for Lloyds to resume dividend payments to shareholders next spring. That\u2019s around six years after it halted payments after being bailed out by the government. RBS shareholders will probably to wait until 2017, Greenwood adds. A virtual hat-tip to the Telegraph\u2019s James Titcomb for summing up today\u2019s results in three Emojis. Here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s news story on today\u2019s bank stress tests: Bank stress tests: Co-op fails as Lloyds and RBS scrape through A reminder, if you\u2019re just joining us, of the details of today\u2019s UK bank stress tests (highlights start here). Eight UK banks were probed to see how their capital reserves would cope in an adverse scenario, in which Britain suffered a steep recession, the pound slumped, inflation soared, interest rates were hiked, the jobless rate doubled and house prices crashed. The Bank of England concluded that Co-op\u2019s capital reserves would be wiped out. RBS and Lloyds were also found to be too weak at the end of 2013, but both banks showed that they have improved their capital positions this year. And these two charts, from the BoE\u2019s financial stability report, show how how global growth prospects have weakened since the spring... ..while fears of a financial crisis hitting the UK have risen a little The Bank of England has also declared that the outlook for the global economy has darkened in the last six months, as political tensions grow. The warning comes in its latest Financial Stability Report (pdf), released alongside today\u2019s stress tests. The BoE says: The global economic outlook has weakened since the June 2014 Report and market concerns over persistent weak nominal growth and geopolitical risk have increased. These developments could affect the outlook for financial stability in the United Kingdom if concerns about persistent low growth lead to a sudden reappraisal of underlying vulnerabilities in highly indebted economies, or if a shift in global risk appetite triggers sharp adjustments in financial markets and undermines business and household confidence. The recent sharp fall in the oil price should support global and UK growth, but it also entails some risk to financial stability. Adjustments will be more disruptive if investors\u2019 pricing of liquidity risk does not fully reflect structural changes in market liquidity. Such developments could lead to stress in funding markets for banks and corporates. In the Committee\u2019s view, these global risks to the outlook for financial stability have increased since June. The Bank also believes that the UK housing market does not pose a greater risk to stability than in June, but \u201cdebt levels in the UK household sector remain high relative to incomes and the insurance\u201d. The UK government argues that today\u2019s stress test should help build a \u201ca stronger and safer banking system\u201d. Andrea Leadsom, economic secretary to the Treasury, says: Ensuring banks\u2019 balance sheets are strong enough to weather future financial storms is a key part of this plan, which is why we welcome today\u2019s stress test results. These new, tougher tests are a central part of our radical banking reforms and show that the system we put in place is working.\u201d The Bank of England doesn\u2019t pull its punches over Lloyds and RBS \u2013 both banks, it says, are \u201csusceptible to a severe economic downturn\u201d. For RBS, it says: In particular, the analysis highlights the potential downside risk which may stem from the Group\u2019s retail and corporate lending portfolios and an exposure to misconduct risks. The message to Lloyds is subtly different, reflecting its greater focus on the UK property market: In particular, the analysis highlights the potential downside risk which may stem from the Group\u2019s retail and commercial lending portfolios and an exposure to misconduct risks faced by the firm. On the question of misconduct.... both banks have been penalised by regulators in recent years. For example, RBS was fined \u00a3390m for its role in the Libor scandal, while Lloyds was ordered to pay \u00a3218m. The purple bars in this chart show how Lloyds and RBS\u2019s capital ratios fell to just 5% and 4.6% respectively under the Bank\u2019s stress tests (before they improved their situation in 2014), while the Co-op was wiped out. While this chart shows how Co-op, Lloyds, Santander and Nationwide are all particularly exposed to the UK housing market. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, says the stress test should give us confidence in the strength of the UK banking sector: This was a demanding test. The results show that the core of the banking system is significantly more resilient, that it has the strength to continue to serve the real economy even in a severe stress, and that the growing confidence in the system is merited.\u201d This chart show how Co-op\u2019s capital reserves would be wiped out in the adverse scenario used by the BoE, to minus 2.6% of assets. The second and third columns show how Lloyds and RBS have already improved their capital positions since the end of 2013. Those \u2018strategic management actions\u2019 mean the two banks aren\u2019t being told to raise more capital. The stress test results are online here. Barclays, HSBC, Nationwide, Santander UK and Standard Chartered have all been given a clean bill of health. The Bank of England\u2019s stress tests are out. And the top line is that the Co-operative Bank, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland all fallen short of the stringent test. Lloyds and RBS have already strengthened themselves since the examination was conducted, so haven\u2019t technically failed. They\u2019ve only just scraped though. The Co-op\u2019s capital reserves would have been drained by the conditions in the stress tests (a sharp recession, sharply higher inflation and unemployment), the BoE said. The Co-op was forced to resubmit its capital plan, as its capital buffer would be negative in the event of a major economic crisis. We\u2019re about to get a flurry of announcements. The Bank of England will release the results of the stress tests, and also unlock the doors to let out the journalists who\u2019ve been briefed on the details since 5am. And the banks should all issue their own statements..... The eight institutions being tested are Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander, Standard Chartered, Co-operative Bank and the Nationwide building society. The Co-op Bank has already laid the ground for failure, saying it would be \u201cno surprise\u201d if it didn\u2019t pass the BoE\u2019s test. That makes sense - the troubled lender it has already raised almost \u00a32bn to cover a black hole in its books. RBS will want to avoid a repeat of its embarrassment over the EU stress tests \u2013 it admitted messing up its numbers so it actually only narrowly passed. Lloyds shareholders should cross their fingers and hope it sails through; a weak results could make it harder to restart its dividend. And if Standard Chartered does poorly, investors may fret about its exposure to emerging markets in Asia.... Jill Treanor\u2019s preview piece from the Observer has more details.... Today\u2019s examination should be more rigorous than the Europe-wide stress tests announced back in October (which Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS passed). The Bank of England is using subjective measures of a bank\u2019s financial health, such as the type of capital that is being accumulated and the extent to which the lender has been able to anticipate risks. It is also tougher; the 35% fall in house prices is nearly twice as severe as the 20% in the EBA test. Good morning. We\u2019re about to learn which of Britain\u2019s banks are strong enough to survive a major economic turmoil, and which would be sunk. The Bank of England is releasing the details of its detailed stress tests into the UK banking sector, at 7am GMT. Seven banks, and the Nationwide building society, have been put through their paces by BoE officials to see if they would cope if Britain tumbled into a steep recession, the housing market turned sour, and inflation and joblessness rocketed. The test is based on the stuff of economic nightmares. It models the following: The economy shrinking by 3.5% in 2015 Interest rates soaring from 0.5% to 4%, Unemployment doubling to 12% House prices tumbling 35% Inflation hitting 6.5% And a 30% slump in the value of the pound Don\u2019t worry, the Bank doesn\u2019t think this is all going to happen (or if it does, it\u2019s keeping quiet about it). But it wants British bankers to be prepared for the worst. Banks who fail the test will be instructed to raise more capital, by selling assets or tapping shareholders. But a bank which passes could still be ordered to make changes, if BoE officials think it\u2019s being too risky. A group of journalists, including my colleague Jill Treanor, are currently locked in the bowels of the Bank, being briefed about the tests results. We\u2019ll get all the details from 7am, along with the Bank of England\u2019s latest Financial Stability Report. And there\u2019s a press conference scheduled for 9am, led by governor Mark Carney. But that\u2019s not all... Today\u2019s diary is packed with stuff. We also get the latest UK inflation data due at 9.30am; it may have slowed in November, from 1.3% in October. A flurry of manufacturing data is being released, from Asia to Europe to America. The early data from China isn\u2019t great - its factory sector contracted last month. The ZEW survey of German investor confidence being released at 10am GMT. And we\u2019ll have one eye on the Russian rouble, after interest rates were hiked to 17% (!!) last night, and the other eye on Greece as it prepares for a presidential vote which could prompt a snap general elections.",

In the UK, investors latched onto the low inflation figures, betting that they made an interest rate rate unlikely in the near future. Weak US manufacturing figures had a similar effect, while positive German confidence figures and reasonable PMI data helped support European markets. There was also some optimism after US secretary of state John Kerry said Russia had made some constructive moves towards possible reducing tensions in Ukraine, the situation which prompted Western sanctions on the country.

If it fails, and rouble/dollar continues its march towards 100, then default becomes almost inevitable. Sovereign yields have moved sharply higher over the past few days, though at just over 16%, they are hardly priced for default. Equities would suffer in either of our two scenarios.

While the stronger ZEW reading is probably the logical result of lower energy prices and the belief in the healing power of the ECB current measures and, of course, upcoming QE, understanding the PMI remains a mystery. Over recent months, the PMI has failed to show any reliable predictive power. We cannot simply ignore it but until Thursday\u2019s Ifo indicator release, we will store the PMI data in the file labelled \u201cnot important\u201d and go along with the ZEW\u2019s positive mood.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>So Germany\u2019s Dax is currently up 0.81% while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.28%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54904191e4b017bd53de1ac0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-16T15:22:16.903Z\">3.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bba40ae2b2144c55aedbcbcae9f07f01ed52b670\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418740112303/10d604c0-0be3-49d1-879d-c102ee892288-460x302.jpeg\" alt=\"Russia's prime minister Dmitry Medvedev looks on during a meeting of the Government Commission on the Socio-Economic Development of the Far East Federal District at Gorki residence.\" width=\"460\" height=\"302\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russia\u2019s prime minister Dmitry Medvedev today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shtukina Yekaterina/Shtukina Yekaterina/ITAR-TASS Photo/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Moscow has announced that Dmitry Medvedev has met with a group of top officials, including central bank chief Elvira Nabiullina</strong>.</p> <p>Reuters has the details: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev held a meeting on Tuesday with top central bank and government officials on the country\u2019s financial and economic situation, according to a press release published on the government\u2019s website.</p> <p>\u201cThe meeting was attended by First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, an aide to the President of Russia Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina and First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Government Maxim Akimov,\u201d the government said in the press release.</p> <p>It would not reveal any more details about the meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-549047a6e4b0f05d5cd39137\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-16T14:58:42.024Z\">2.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"60e35a95e216b20245e3adc4b97166a898711ea9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418741855130/df7272cd-5867-41de-bd83-9d2f30d6364c-460x290.jpeg\" alt=\"\"Kamaz\" trucks pass by the Kremlin, as they were presented to the UN World Food Program as a gift from Russia in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"290\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And here\u2019s the official line from Moscow, from Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt is true that there is turbulence on the market, which can be largely explained by emotions and a speculative mood.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5490450ce4b07a51e943a014\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-16T14:50:59.955Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Deputy governor: Rate hike was choice between &quot;very bad and very very bad&quot;</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Interfax has published more quotes from Russia\u2019s deputy central bank governor, Sergei Shvetsov.</strong></p> <p>Shvetsov has described last night\u2019s shock interest rate hike, from 10.5% to 17%, as a choice between the \u201cvery, very bad\u201d and the merely \u201cvery bad\u201d.</p> <p>Shvetsov said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The situation is critical.

While the currency has significantly weakened this year, default by the government looks unlikely this time around because Russia has relatively low levels of government debt compared to GDP.</p> <p>Despite this, the Russian economy and companies do face serious problems. Rising interest rates will take a toll on a country which is already on the brink of recession. If the price of oil remains around $60 in 2015, Russia could see economic growth contract by 4.5%, according to the Bank of Russia.

warning comes in its latest <strong>Financial Stability Report (<a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/fsr/2014/fsrfull1412.pdf\">pdf</a>)</strong>, released alongside today\u2019s stress tests.</p> <p>The BoE says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The global economic outlook has weakened since the June 2014 Report and market concerns over persistent weak nominal growth and geopolitical risk have increased. </p> <p>These developments could affect the outlook for financial stability in the United Kingdom if concerns about persistent low growth lead to a sudden reappraisal of underlying vulnerabilities in highly indebted economies, or if a shift in global risk appetite triggers sharp adjustments in financial markets and undermines business and household confidence. </p> <p>The recent sharp fall in the oil price should support global and UK growth, but it also entails some risk to financial stability. Adjustments will be more disruptive if investors\u2019 pricing of liquidity risk does not fully reflect structural changes in market liquidity. </p> <p>Such developments could lead to stress in funding markets for banks and corporates. In the Committee\u2019s view, these global risks to the outlook for financial stability have increased since June.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Bank also believes that the UK housing market does not pose a greater risk to stability than in June, but \u201cdebt levels in the UK household sector remain high relative to incomes and the insurance\u201d.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-548fe27be4b07a51e9439f3a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-16T07:46:26.755Z\">7.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ed3de330d2da7e1af33063ad334957c33bf5a015\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418715965053/1c33a6db-b16f-435d-97ef-0d6ef0fddb8d-460x335.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrea Leadsom.\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UK government argues that today\u2019s stress test should help build a \u201ca stronger and safer banking system\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Andrea Leadsom</strong>, economic secretary to the Treasury, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ensuring banks\u2019 balance sheets are strong enough to weather future financial storms is a key part of this plan, which is why we welcome today\u2019s stress test results.

But it wants British bankers to be prepared for the worst.</p> <p>Banks who fail the test will be instructed to raise more capital, by selling assets or tapping shareholders.

A megabank?

If interest rates go up in 2015, as some economists predict they will, this will be a boon for banks. That\u2019s particularly true of some of the biggest, who will benefit twice over: collecting more income on the spread between interest income and deposits and on <a href=\"http://247wallst.com/banking-finance/2014/12/04/deutsche-banks-top-large-cap-bank-stocks-for-2015/\">any uptick in fixed income trading</a>. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f973b1820ff746122b9ddd4ebceeb019c7f69265\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/15/1418683807613/d7e678b5-25e5-48ec-b544-cba3cf260319-460x325.jpeg\" alt=\"Warren\" width=\"460\" height=\"325\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Elizabeth Warren, right, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, and Rep.

Banks believe that regulators are preventing a permanent return to pre-crisis levels of profitability. (Cue a laugh from Warren\u2019s camp, which may wonder: what regulation?) <br></p> <p>Chris Lee, manager of Fidelity\u2019s Select Financial Services Portfolio, says banks are under-earning compared to their potential. <br></p> <p>A big reason for that is the controversy that still surrounds banks, he says, and the area where the controversy is the greatest is where the banks are biggest. <br></p> <p>\u201cWill the deluge of regulation ever let up? Will litigation risk ever subside?\u201d</p> <p>Some value investors have been willing to bet that it will. This year, Tony Coniaris, a portfolio manager at Oakmark Select, one of the best-performing mutual funds of 2014, noted that one of the areas in which the fund has recently found value is in some of the largest banks, including Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America. <br></p> <p>Their balance sheets are stronger, Coniaris pointed out, and the quality of their assets has improved. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe businesses are performing fine, and the question is when will the negative news drumbeat subside,\u201d he said. For some companies too, Coniaris said, the regulatory cloud has made it difficult for shareholders to understand just when some banks will be able to return excess capital to shareholders.</p> <p>Citigroup is probably the poster child for disillusioned and disenchanted megabank investors. It looked like it was really turning things around. <br></p> <p>Of the surviving banks, Citigroup came the closest to complete collapse, and it wasn\u2019t until last year that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2013/09/10/government-banks-15-billion-on-citigroup-bailout/\">sold the last chunk of its stake in Citi</a>, ending the five-year bailout. </p> <p>But early this year, Citigroup flunked the Fed\u2019s stress test, meaning that it wasn\u2019t allowed to follow through on its plans to buy back $6.4bn of stock or quintuple its minuscule 1 cent per share quarterly dividend. (JP Morgan Chase pays a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share.) </p> <p> Then last week came the announcement by Michael Corbat, Citigroup\u2019s CEO, that the bank will take a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/09/us-citigroup-charges-idUSKBN0JN1QV20141209\">$2.7bn charge against its fourth-quarter earnings</a> for litigation costs (as well as $800m for restructuring). <br></p> <p>Together they will pretty much wipe out the bank\u2019s expected earnings, analysts calculate. That\u2019s the second time in less than two months that the bank announced big legal charges. The government is also probing Citigroup in connection with manipulating foreign exchange markets and other offenses. </p> <p> Still, Citigroup ranks well below industry \u201cleader\u201d Bank of America in terms of either the number of suits it has settled so far, or the dollars it has had to fork out to resolve the litigation. <br></p> <p>According to Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Bank of America has paid nearly $58bn in a total of 24 settlements, with JP Morgan Chase coming second, with $31.6bn paid in 15 settlements. In contrast, Citigroup has forked over a relatively meager $12.9bn in 12 settlements. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8072049a5f961c3fd9313aacd490b1b29294d578\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/15/1418683897386/a796636e-0fc3-478f-85d6-9235f46538f0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Citi\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Citigroup has several lawsuits lodged against it, but investors don\u2019t seem to mind.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The litigation risk may finally be dwindling, as more banks reach settlements on the biggest legacy issues from the financial crisis: the question of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/21/everything-you-need-to-know-about-jpmorgans-13-billion-settlement/\">mortgage mis-selling and fraud</a>. In August, Bank of America reached a massive $16.65bn agreement, for instance. </p> <p> But litigation isn\u2019t the whole story. <br></p> <p>There is also the ongoing burden of regulation to consider: one study calculated the <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/30/the-cost-of-new-banking-regulation-70-2-billion/\">costs of complying with new banking regulations doubled</a> from 2007 to 2013 to hit $70.2bn for the six largest US banks, thanks to new rules aimed specifically at institutions with assets of more than $50bn. </p> <p>In a recent 2015 outlook for the sector, the analysts at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods warned that the largest banks might not see any relief in the new year, as regulators are likely to resume pushing for them to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-13/too-big-fail-banks-seen-facing-capital-gap-of-up-to-870-billion.html\">hold still more capital on their books</a> to guard against future crises. </p> <p>\u201cThe giant banks are being given huge incentives not to exist any longer,\u201d says Peters, at Clearbridge Advisors. <br></p> <p>Will investors want to own their shares? Regulators \u2013 and politicians like Senator Warren \u2013 clearly hope not, and that directors will get the message and act to break up the megabanks. <br></p> <p>But some are still attracted to the tremendous bargains on offer among the biggest banking stocks. Would they rather buy Bank of America at about 0.8 times book value? <br></p> <p>Then, too, there\u2019s the question of whether you really want to bet against the banks. Look at what Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, just managed to pull off, to the fury of Democrats: he convinced the Obama administration that it would be OK to once again allow banks to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/12/11/the-item-that-is-blowing-up-the-budget-deal/\">conduct some of their riskiest activities using their own balance sheets</a>. That\u2019s something that was banned as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, and the bankers just succeeded in getting it rolled back as part of the $1.1tn budget bill. The language in the bill was literally drafted by the good folks at Citigroup.</p> <p> That may not be great news if you are worried about the future of financial regulation. If, however, you are looking for a sign that the shares of the country\u2019s megabanks are great values rather than just value traps \u2013 well, you couldn\u2019t ask for anything better.</p>",

A megabank? Well, that\u2019s closer to 10 to 12 times earnings, he says. As an investor, Peters says, that means he is \u201cgetting paid to take regulatory risk\u201d. There is even a bonus. If interest rates go up in 2015, as some economists predict they will, this will be a boon for banks. That\u2019s particularly true of some of the biggest, who will benefit twice over: collecting more income on the spread between interest income and deposits and on any uptick in fixed income trading. True, sluggish trading revenues and lackluster loan growth have dented banking revenues and profits in recent years. Banks believe that regulators are preventing a permanent return to pre-crisis levels of profitability. (Cue a laugh from Warren\u2019s camp, which may wonder: what regulation?) Chris Lee, manager of Fidelity\u2019s Select Financial Services Portfolio, says banks are under-earning compared to their potential. A big reason for that is the controversy that still surrounds banks, he says, and the area where the controversy is the greatest is where the banks are biggest. \u201cWill the deluge of regulation ever let up? Will litigation risk ever subside?\u201d Some value investors have been willing to bet that it will. This year, Tony Coniaris, a portfolio manager at Oakmark Select, one of the best-performing mutual funds of 2014, noted that one of the areas in which the fund has recently found value is in some of the largest banks, including Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America. Their balance sheets are stronger, Coniaris pointed out, and the quality of their assets has improved. \u201cThe businesses are performing fine, and the question is when will the negative news drumbeat subside,\u201d he said. For some companies too, Coniaris said, the regulatory cloud has made it difficult for shareholders to understand just when some banks will be able to return excess capital to shareholders. Citigroup is probably the poster child for disillusioned and disenchanted megabank investors. It looked like it was really turning things around. Of the surviving banks, Citigroup came the closest to complete collapse, and it wasn\u2019t until last year that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation sold the last chunk of its stake in Citi, ending the five-year bailout. But early this year, Citigroup flunked the Fed\u2019s stress test, meaning that it wasn\u2019t allowed to follow through on its plans to buy back $6.4bn of stock or quintuple its minuscule 1 cent per share quarterly dividend. (JP Morgan Chase pays a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share.) Then last week came the announcement by Michael Corbat, Citigroup\u2019s CEO, that the bank will take a $2.7bn charge against its fourth-quarter earnings for litigation costs (as well as $800m for restructuring). Together they will pretty much wipe out the bank\u2019s expected earnings, analysts calculate. That\u2019s the second time in less than two months that the bank announced big legal charges. The government is also probing Citigroup in connection with manipulating foreign exchange markets and other offenses. Still, Citigroup ranks well below industry \u201cleader\u201d Bank of America in terms of either the number of suits it has settled so far, or the dollars it has had to fork out to resolve the litigation. According to Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Bank of America has paid nearly $58bn in a total of 24 settlements, with JP Morgan Chase coming second, with $31.6bn paid in 15 settlements. In contrast, Citigroup has forked over a relatively meager $12.9bn in 12 settlements. The litigation risk may finally be dwindling, as more banks reach settlements on the biggest legacy issues from the financial crisis: the question of mortgage mis-selling and fraud. In August, Bank of America reached a massive $16.65bn agreement, for instance. But litigation isn\u2019t the whole story. There is also the ongoing burden of regulation to consider: one study calculated the costs of complying with new banking regulations doubled from 2007 to 2013 to hit $70.2bn for the six largest US banks, thanks to new rules aimed specifically at institutions with assets of more than $50bn. In a recent 2015 outlook for the sector, the analysts at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods warned that the largest banks might not see any relief in the new year, as regulators are likely to resume pushing for them to hold still more capital on their books to guard against future crises. \u201cThe giant banks are being given huge incentives not to exist any longer,\u201d says Peters, at Clearbridge Advisors. Will investors want to own their shares? Regulators \u2013 and politicians like Senator Warren \u2013 clearly hope not, and that directors will get the message and act to break up the megabanks. But some are still attracted to the tremendous bargains on offer among the biggest banking stocks. Would they rather buy Bank of America at about 0.8 times book value? Then, too, there\u2019s the question of whether you really want to bet against the banks. Look at what Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, just managed to pull off, to the fury of Democrats: he convinced the Obama administration that it would be OK to once again allow banks to conduct some of their riskiest activities using their own balance sheets. That\u2019s something that was banned as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, and the bankers just succeeded in getting it rolled back as part of the $1.1tn budget bill. The language in the bill was literally drafted by the good folks at Citigroup. That may not be great news if you are worried about the future of financial regulation. If, however, you are looking for a sign that the shares of the country\u2019s megabanks are great values rather than just value traps \u2013 well, you couldn\u2019t ask for anything better.",

Such a severe downturn has \u201chappened only in a single episode over the past 150 years \u2013 and that was in the immediate aftermath of the first world war,\u201d the Bank said.

To test the mortgage books of the major UK lenders, the hypothetical scenario included interest rates spiralling from their record low of 0.5% to over 4% and an unprecedented 35% crash in house prices back to 2002 levels. Unemployment, meanwhile, would hit 12% \u2013 double its current level; sterling would fall 30% in the first year and inflation would peak at 6.5% in early 2015. These UK specific scenarios have been bolted on top of the one designed by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and imposed on 123 banks - 24 of which failed when the result was published at the end of October.

      "bodyText": "The mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) released yesterday was a case of the karma police arresting Joe Hockey and reading him his rights. The Myefo revealed a large write down in taxation revenue which saw the budget deficit for 2014-15 increase by $10.6bn \u2013 from $29.8bn to now, $40.3bn. Revenue problems were a habitual concern for Wayne Swan while treasurer. But during that time, Hockey never gave him any of the sympathy he now believes he is entitled. While this year sees a $10.6bn larger deficit, the following three years are just as bad. In 2015-16 the deficit is $14.16bn larger than forecast in the May budget, it\u2019s $10.3bn bigger in 2016-17, and $8.6bn greater in 2017-18. All up it comes to a total increase of $43.7bn in cumulative deficits over the next four years. Not only is it worse than was predicted in May, it is worse than was predicted in last year\u2019s Myefo \u2013 which saw Joe Hockey trying his very best to make the situation look as bad as possible in order to lay the blame of the deficits on the ALP: Most of the blowout in the surplus is due to \u201cparameter changes\u201d \u2013 essentially downgrades in economic forecasts such as level of employment growth and the drop in our terms of trade. In May, employment was forecast to grow by 1.5% this year, now it is expected to only increase by 1%; similarly the unemployment rate is now predicted to reach 6.5% by June next year, rather than 6.25%: The big difference is the terms of trade. In May it was expected to fall by 6.75% \u2013 already a significant drop \u2013 now, however, it is set to fall by 13.5%. Altogether these have led to taxation revenue for this year predicted to be 1.9% below what was anticipated in May and 2.3% below what was expected for 2015-16: The biggest falls are in individual income tax \u2013 down $2.7bn in both this year and the next \u2013 and company tax. Company tax falls $2.64bn this year, but next year is forecast to be 6.1% below what was expected in May \u2013 $4.6bn less than expected. Admittedly, such falls were largely unanticipated. Some may have thought the 6.25% drop in the terms of trade was too optimistic, but few people would have been predicting the iron ore price would now be half what it was a year ago. But while the terms of trade fall of 13.5% in this financial year is the biggest since records began being kept in 1959, in 2012-13 it fell then by a record 10% and, rather than acknowledge those difficulties, Joe Hockey was rather quick to blame the government. Before the 2013 budget, he and Tony Abbott issued a media release suggesting that they wanted \u201cto see credible and achievable forecasts. Australia can\u2019t afford another year of Labor \u2018cooking the books\u2019 and the inevitable blowout that follows\u201d. Yeah, blowouts are bad... They noted that instead of a promised surplus in 2012-13 \u201cthere was a $21bn blowout and in the year before there was a $7bn blowout\u201d. That made for $28bn in cumulative \u201cdeficit \u201cblowouts\u201d\u2013 only slightly worse than the predicted $25bn blowout expected over this year and the next. They also wheeled out their favourite line that \u201cLabor has a spending problem, not a revenue problem\u201d. To support this they noted that revenue was \u201cexpected to be over $70bn higher than at the end of the Howard government, and with budget data for the first seven months of this financial year showing revenues up by almost five per cent relative to the same period in the previous financial year\u201d. So it must be a shock for Hockey to find that not only is revenue this year expected to be $84bn \u201chigher than at the end of the Howard government\u201d and higher than Labor, it is also expected to grow over the next four years by an average of 6.3% each year. Of course nominal dollar terms can be misleading, but at no stage over the next four years is total government revenue ever expected to be lower than the 23.3% of GDP that was the high water mark under the Rudd and Gillard governments: Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey also noted that the ALP government was \u201cspending almost $100bn a year more than in the last year of the Howard government\u201d. So it must be embarrassing for them both to find that this year they will spend almost $145bn \u201ca year more than in the last year of the Howard government\u201d, and that this financial year sees expenditure a mere 0.1% of GDP below the 26% of GDP that occurred in 2009-10 when the Rudd government responded to the GFC with a massive stimulus: The Myefo does anticipate expenditure to grow at well below average levels over the next four years, but it also expects the budget to be back into surplus by 2019-20. Given in 2013\u201114 it was in deficit of 3.1% of GDP, that six-year turnaround would be an improvement in the budget position not seen since the last six years of the 1990s. That\u2019s a big ask given that from 1994-2000 Australia\u2019s economy grew by an average of 4.2% each year, compared to the average of 3.1% predicted for the next four years. Clearly comparing the budget revenue and expenditure as Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott did while they were in opposition is utterly moronic. Nominal figures ignore inflation and growth of the population and the economy itself. It is apt that their words should come back to haunt them. But it would be in all our interests, given the challenges that approach the government and our economy, from the ageing population to the end of the mining boom, if our treasurer would now adopt a more intelligent rhetoric. It would also be good if the current shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, did not ape Hockey\u2019s words.
