      "bodyText": "The number of cars built in the UK slumped again year-on-year last month, as global trade tensions and concerns over the shape of Brexit and the future of diesel vehicles took their toll. Car manufacturing fell 16.8% in September from a year ago to 127,051 vehicles, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). It is the fourth month in a row that output has fallen sharply compared to the same month in 2017, with June recording the steepest drop, of 47%. Some 25,610 fewer cars rolled off production lines than in September last year year, capping off a turbulent first nine months of 2018 for the UK car industry. The number of cars made between January and September dropped 6.6% compared with the same period in 2017, to 1.17m. Production for the UK market slumped by nearly a fifth, while output destined for overseas markets was down 3.3%. Apart from trade wars and growing fears of a no-deal Brexit, the trade body also blamed model changes and testing backlogs after tougher new emissions regulations came into effect on 1 September. All cars sold in the EU are now subject to the worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure, measuring all regulated emissions as well as CO2 and fuel economy. Last month also marked the worst September since 2008 for car sales. September is traditionally a bumper month as consumers rush to buy cars with new number plates. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cIt has been a turbulent year and the industry needs stability, something which appears elusive given the lack of resolution to Brexit negotiations. \u201cThe UK government has recognised the importance of a deal that maintains free and frictionless trade with the EU, but it is up to all sides to deliver this to safeguard the hundreds of thousands of jobs depending on the sector.\u201d A survey from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), Britain\u2019s leading employers\u2019 organisation, this week showed that confidence among manufacturers was falling at the fastest rate since the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum in June 2016. The CBI warned that the deadlocked Brexit talks had led to investment being scaled back and the sharpest fall in order books in three years. The SMMT figures show car production for the UK market fell by 19% year-on-year in September, while the number of vehicles made for export dropped 16.2%. Exports still account for eight out of every 10 cars produced. Stuart Apperley, head of UK automotive at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said businesses throughout the car supply chain had stepped up contingency plans \u201cfor the full range of possible Brexit outcomes\u201d in the past few weeks. Most of the cars made in Britain are exported \u2013 more than half of them to the EU \u2013 and most British buyers get their vehicles from overseas, with about 86% of new cars being imported and 69% of vehicles coming from the EU. Apperley also noted that demand from China had fallen, while consumers are unsure what the future will hold for diesel vehicles following Volkswagen\u2019s \u2018Dieselgate\u2019 emissions-rigging scandal in 2015. Apperley said: \u201cDiesel sales have all but collapsed in the wake of prolonged uncertainty as to whether governments across the world will take a punitive approach to them in future. Add to that recent changes to subsidies on hybrid and electric vehicles as well and consumers and businesses are all having to second-guess what will happen to the value of any new car they buy.\u201d The SMMT chief called on the chancellor to use his budget next Monday to stimulate the market, which would help bolster manufacturing output and the economy as a whole, as well as delivering environmental goals.",

    "webTitle": "Dow Jones falls 600 points as market volatility continues \u2013as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up: The US stock market has suffered another day of big losses, as investors worry about the state of the economy, trade wars, and possible interest rate rises. The Dow shed more than 600 points, wiping out all its gains for 2018, while the Nasdaq dropped into a correction. Analysts warned that further losses are possible, as fear grips the markets. Manufacturers warned that Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars are pushing up their costs. Tariffs are making raw materials and imports more expensive, eating into profits. However two companies - Boeing and Tesla - bucked the trend with forecast-beating results. European companies have suffered a worrying slowdown in growth this month. Trade wars may be to blame here too, with manufacturers suffering a drop in orders. Brexit angst is weighing on the pound. Sterling fell to a seven week low, below $1.29, as Theresa May struggles to reach an agreement on Britain\u2019s transition deal. Goodnight! Tesla has addressed a lot of criticism with its results tonight, says Alan Boyle of Geekwire. He writes: Tesla shares jumped more than 10 percent in after-hours trading today after the controversial electric-car company posted a surprisingly positive quarterly report, including a profit rather than a loss. Adjusted net income for the third quarter amounted to $312 million, which translated into earnings of $2.90 a share. Analysts had expected a loss of around 19 cents per share. Total revenue hit $6.8 billion, exceeding expectations of $6.3 billion. And Tesla\u2019s cash on hand increased by $731 million, even though Tesla repaid $82.5 million in bonds during the quarter. That cash position could take some of the pressure off Tesla, which had been burning through its reserves by the billions during what CEO Elon Musk called \u201cproduction hell\u201d for the company\u2019s Model 3 electric car. Analysts had worried that Tesla would have to borrow more money to stay afloat. But Tesla said \u201cour cash position should remain at least flat in spite of our plan to repay $230 million of convertible notes in cash\u201d during the current quarter. Shares in Tesla have surged 12% in after-hours trading. Investors are scrambling to grab a stake in the company following its surprise move to profitability. Amid the gloom tonight, electric car company Tesla has stunned the markets with much better results than expected. Elon Musk\u2019s company made a profit of $312m in the last quarter, surprising analysts who expected another loss. That\u2019s its first profit in two years. Revenues hit a record, at $6.82 billion, beating expectations of $6.33bn. After a long struggle to meet production targets for its Model 3, and Musk\u2019s well-known run-ins with regulators, has Tesla finally turned the corner? Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes it has. He writes: \u201cProduction numbers earlier this month meant we already knew Tesla could churn out the cars, the question was whether it could it do it profitably, and even more importantly, could Musk wean the company off a constant flow of cash from investors. To say Tesla\u2019s answer is emphatic is an understatement. Gross margins on the Model 3 are above even the company\u2019s own lofty expectations and its position as the 5th most popular car by volume in the US suggests it\u2019s drawing in a wide range of customers despite its comparatively high price point. Drivers will pay more for Musk it would seem. That\u2019s important because the premium end alone won\u2019t deliver the impressive growth Tesla needs in the coming years to justify its premium valuation. Normally we\u2019d tell investors to avoid reading too deeply into a single quarter\u2019s numbers, but this quarter really counted at Tesla. Reading deeply is something of pleasure today.\u201d There\u2019s a scent of fear in the air in the markets tonight, according to Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. Zaccarelli says (via Reuters) that there may be more turmoil ahead: \u201cAt this point it seems selling is begetting selling. The VIX [volatility index] has doubled in the last couple of weeks. There\u2019s a bit more fear in the air and you\u2019re seeing the acceleration of growth to value. \u201cIt looks like more panic and fear as the selling has continued to roll.\u201d Here\u2019s now Marketwatch sums up today\u2019s Wall Street wobble: Stocks ended sharply lower Wednesday, as losses accelerated into the close and put both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 into the red for the year, and the Nasdaq into correction territory. Upbeat results from Boeing Co. were credited with briefly pushing the Dow higher in early morning trading, before investors took an increasingly defensive stance, fleeing for the relative safety of utilities and consumer nondurable shares. Another day, another big loss on Wall Street! The Dow Jones industrial average managed to lose 608 points by the close, meaning it has lost all its gains for 2018. It closed 2.4% lower at 24,583. Technology shares, such as Microsoft (-5%) and Intel (-4.6%), fell sharply, while construction equipment group Caterpillar shed another 5.8%. In another blow, the Nasdaq index slumped by over 4%, putting it into correction territory (more than 10% off its recent high). Investors seem to again be gripped by worries about global trade, geopolitical tensions, and the state of the US economy -- with new home sales slowing, and manufacturers warning that cost pressure are going up. Donald Trump\u2019s row with the Federal Reserve over future interest rate rises, and the ongoing Brexit deadlock, can\u2019t have helped the mood either. Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies and solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York, explained: \u201cIt\u2019s a big global risk-off trade. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some headwinds, higher interest rates affecting housing, tariffs causing input costs for manufacturers to go up, which makes earnings look not as stellar ... but that doesn\u2019t mean the whole economy is rolling over,\u201d Those weak home sales figures haven\u2019t helped the mood in New York. The Dow is having another down day, currently off 221 points (-0.9%) at 24,969. Fiona Cincotta of City Index sees nervousness on the trading floors: Despite clawing back heavy losses on turnaround Tuesday, Wall Street has once again opened on the back foot. With a long list of risk factors, including Italy\u2019s growing tensions with Brussels, Saudi Arabia\u2019s increased isolation over Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s killing, global growth worries and some earnings disappointments investors are struggling to find reasons to buy in. The Federal Reserve may ignore Donald Trump\u2019s complaints, but they should heed the latest US housing data. New home sales fell to an annual rate of just 553,000 in September, 13.2% less than a year ago, and the weakest rate since December 2016. That could suggest the housing market is cooling - perhaps in response to recent Fed rate hikes which have made borrowing more expensive. A late sell-off has sent most European markets into the red tonight. At the close of trading, Germany\u2019s DAX was down 0.7% while the French CAC shed 0.3%. This morning\u2019s weaker than expected PMI reports rather dampened the mood (and the Euro!) Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB had yet another bad day, losing 1.7% as the clash with Brussels over its 2019 budget rages. Markets had been higher this morning, but it seems that investors didn\u2019t trust the recovery - especially with so many risks (Italy, Brexit, Saudi Arabia) to think about. In London, the FTSE 100 has closed 7 points higher, as the weaker pound propped up shares. Some snap reaction: The Bank of Canada has hiked borrowing costs, taking its benchmark interest rate up to 1.75%, from 1.5%. That\u2019s largely as expected, but shows that the Federal Reserve isn\u2019t the only central bank moving away from crisis-era policies. America\u2019s companies are still growing, but they\u2019re also facing tough price pressures. That\u2019s according to the latest healthcheck from data firm Markit, just released. It shows US output growth hitting a three-month high, encouraging firms to take on more staff. However, they\u2019re also having to pay more for raw materials, and imports, as Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars kick in. Chris Williamson of Markit explains: \u201cThe domestic economy remained the main driver of demand, with exports stagnating amid growing signs of trade being subdued by tariffs. Tariffs also drove a further marked rise in prices, exacerbating an upward trend in price pressures borne out of robust domestic demand. Just in: Europe\u2019s steel industry has been hit by a surge in imports from overseas. The steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump seem to have had a knock-on effect, with metals that was destined for America ending up in Europe instead. According to European steel association Euroferi, imports from Turkey have increased by 57% this year, while those from Russia are up 56%. Trump impose a 50% tariff on Turkish steel, as part of a diplomatic row with Ankara, making it very uncompetitive. That had a knock-on effect on Russia, which sells a chunk of its steel to Turkey (which is now swimming in the stuff). Ding ding goes the opening bell in New York....and the markets aren\u2019t doing very much. The Dow has risen by 0.3%, or 71 points, to 25,262 in early trading, with Boeing gaining 3%. European stock markets are pushing higher, as Boeing\u2019s decent results brings some cheer to the trading floors. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is up 80-odd points, recovering yesterday\u2019s losses, and the other indices are also looking healthier. By hiking its profit forecasts, Boeing has brought some confidence that corporate earnings - and economic growth - is holding up well. European multinational companies are also getting a currency boost. With the euro and pound dropping against the dollar today, their overseas earnings are more valuable. Abi Oladimeji, Chief Investment Officer at Thomas Miller Investment, thinks investors should be cautious, though: \u201cThe current double-digit pace of earnings growth (expected to be circa 20% in Q3) is clearly unsustainable and this will create a headwind in the months ahead. For this reason, as well as the ongoing elevated levels of political and policy uncertainty in key regions of the world, we retain a cautious outlook on equities for now and await better opportunities to add to holdings. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on Boeing\u2019s strong results today. Boeing topped analysts\u2019 forecasts for quarterly profit on Wednesday and raised its forecasts for annual profit as it continued to benefit from a boom in global air travel and demand for airplanes. Shares of the world\u2019s biggest planemaker were up 3.1 percent at $361 in premarket trading, helping brighten the mood on Wall Street after a handful of shaky results outlooks on Tuesday from U.S. manufacturers hurt by concerns over global trade. Soaring demand from commercial airlines has driven another surge in revenues for Boeing over the past year, pushing shares in the company up by roughly a third over the past 12 months. Those moves have been dented somewhat by a combination of the trade worries, this year\u2019s greater market volatility and a series of recurring charges for its KC-46 tanker program. More here. (Sonic) Boom! Aircraft maker Boeing has posted strong results and raised its forecast for earnings this year. In a boost to morale on Wall Street, Boeing posted earnings of $3.58 per share, beating forecasts of $3.47 per share. With plane sales looking robust, the company now expects to make $14.90-$15.10 per share this financial year, up from $14.30-$14.50 per share. This optimism has sent Boeing shares up by 4% in pre-market trading. That might be enough to push the Dow higher at the open, in an hour\u2019s time. The pound\u2019s weakness today is partly because the dollar is strengthening against a basket of currencies. The dollar index has hit a nine-week high today, as the greenback rallied across the board. I can\u2019t spot a particular reason why. But it may suggest investors expect the Federal Reserve will ignore Trump\u2019s latest attack on Jay Powell, and raise interest rates in December. Newsflash: The pound has hit a new six-week low, as Brexit anxiety swirls to new heights. Sterling has fallen by three quarters of a cent today to $1.291, its weakest point since 10th September. The sell-off comes as Theresa May struggles to reach an agreement on Britain\u2019s transition deal. Yesterday, she couldn\u2019t get the whole cabinet onside, making traders wonder how she will get an agreement through parliament. My colleague Dan Sabbagh explains: No 10 sources conceded that the discussion, which came a day before the prime minister was due to plead for support from Tory MPs at a meeting of the party\u2019s 1922 Committee, was \u201cimpassioned\u201d. Others characterised it as a row. A group of ministers, including Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary; Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury; and Michael Gove, the agriculture secretary, were among half a dozen who emphasised their concern over imposing a time limit on any backstop, which is designed to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. Later today, the PM will meet with Conservative MPs to plead for their support. That could be another stormy session, after some anonymous MPs unpleasantly told the Sunday papers that she should \u201cbring her own noose\u201d to the 1922 committee meeting. Britain\u2019s National Audit Office (the government watchdog) has piled more pressure on, saying a no-deal Brexit could undermine security at the UK border and increase delays. Donald Trump\u2019s latest attack on Fed chair Jerome Powell hasn\u2019t cheered Wall Street. The New York stock exchange is expected to open lower in a few hours, with the Dow called down 0.8%. European stock markets are actually up this morning, with the FTSE 100 gaining 50 points or 0.7%. Craig Erlam of foreign exchange firm OANDA says there is \u201ca huge amount of anxiety in the markets\u201d today, partly due to anxiety over US interest rate hikes. The US has been late to the game when it comes to the stock market sell-off, having been sheltered by last year\u2019s tax cuts but they\u2019re wasting no time in playing catch-up, with the S&amp;P and Dow both fast closing in on 10% declines from the peak in a matter of weeks, while the Nasdaq has already ticked that box. Trump has been quick to point the finger of blame at the Fed, with the President desperately not wanting to be associated with a stock market sell-off in the run up to the mid-term elections. Especially when he\u2019s spent the last two years taking credit for the colossal gains. Rising interest rates has clearly been a factor in the loss of confidence in the stock market in recent weeks, with trade wars, Brexit, Italy\u2019s budget issues and the Khashoggi murder also being important contributing factors. Some good jobs news amid the gloom: car rental chain Enterprise are taking on 800 new graduate trainees. The roles are scattered across Enterprise\u2019s 470 branches across the UK. Do well, and you could be assistant manager within a year, they say. More details here. Back in the UK, new mortgage approvals have fallen to a six-month low. Industry figures show that 38,505 home loans were approved in September, down from 39,241 in August, and 6.7% less than a year ago. This may show that the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate rise, in August, has chilled the housing market. UK Finance\u2019s managing director of personal finance, Eric Leenders, suggests people raced to get new mortgages before the BoE rate hike: \u201cThe mortgage market softened slightly in September, following strong remortgaging activity in the months preceding the recent base rate rise.\u201d Brexit uncertainty may be another factor, of course. As Stephen Pegge, UK Finance\u2019s managing director for commercial finance, puts it: \u201cEconomic uncertainty continues to impact on businesses\u2019 appetite for finance as overall lending remains slightly below the same period last year. This morning\u2019s weak eurozone PMI report has hurt the euro. The euro has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.141, as investors fear that the eurozone is weakening. If so, it could make it harder for the European Central Bank to normalise monetary policy and raise interest rates above their record low of zero (a level Donald Trump can only dream of....) Mike Dolan of Reuters shows how German firms are particularly downbeat, according to today\u2019s PMI report. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics says European carmakers are struggling to meet new tougher emissions rules (which has also hurt car sales recently). Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson fears the eurozone economy could be heading for choppier waters: Newsflash: Eurozone corporate growth is stumbling this month, as tariffs and trade wars hit economic demand. Data firm Markit reports that business growth is the slowest for over two years, while optimism has hit a four-year low in October. Firms reported a slowdown in exports, particularly in manufacturing, where new export orders for goods decreased for the first time since June 2013. This has pulled Markit\u2019s Flash Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index down to 52.7, a 25 month low, down from 54.1 in September. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, was hit particularly hard. Factory output rose by the smallest in almost four years, while service sector growth was the slowest since May. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the eurozone appears to be slowing as the economic outlook darkens. \u201cThe pace of Eurozone economic growth slipped markedly lower in October, with the PMI setting the scene for a disappointing end to the year. The survey is indicative of GDP growth waning to 0.3% in the fourth quarter, and forward-looking indicators, such as measures of future expectations and new business inflows, suggest further momentum could be lost in coming months. The slowdown is being led by a drop in exports, linked in turn by many survey respondents to trade wars and tariffs, which appears to have darkened the global economic environment and led to increased risk aversion. It is therefore not surprising to see the slowdown broadening out across the economy, hitting the service sector. Paul Donovan of UBS isn\u2019t impressed by this latest attack on the Federal Reserve. He told clients that the real risk comes from trade wars or excessive tax cuts, not monetary policy. US President Trump has suggested the Fed is the greatest threat to the US economy. An economist would suggest recessions arise from overheating (caused by deficit financed tax cuts, perhaps), or policy error (disrupting supply chains on which an economy depends, perhaps). Zero real rates with full employment are probably not a (restrictive) policy error. The big question is whether Donald Trump could reprise his days on The Apprentice, and tell Jerome Powell that \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d. And the answer? Probably not. The Federal Reserve Act only permits the President to remove a Governor \u201cfor cause\u201d, and no chairman has ever been fired. But we live in interesting times. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada says you can hardly sack a Fed chair for raising borrowing costs. Overnight Trump stepped up criticism of Powell, saying \u201cevery time we do something great, he raises the interest rates\u201d and that it is the \u201cbiggest risk\u201d to the US economy, despite this being the slowest ever Fed tightening cycle. He didn\u2019t answer what would make him try and replace the Fed chair. By law he can only fire governors \u201cfor cause\u201d and raising interest rates can hardly be considered a cause \u2013 whether Congress would stop him perhaps depends on whether Democrats manage to take the house. David Madden of CMC Markets points out that Donald Trump\u2019s recent tax cuts are also putting pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates: President Trump attacked Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, for hiking interest rates. Mr Trump is ignoring the fact that his tax cuts helped spur on US economic growth, which warrant higher rates. I fear Donald Trump is on shaky ground when he complains that the Fed blessed president Obama with record low interest rates, but hiked on his watch. When Obama took office, America had fallen into a deep recession as the financial crisis raged. This forced the Fed to slash borrowing costs to stimulate growth. Today, the US economy is running at its fastest pace since 2014 - something Trump isn\u2019t bashful about taking credit for. US inflation hit 2.7% in August, over the Fed\u2019s target, and policymakers fear that rising prices could get out of hand, unless borrowing costs rise. As CNN puts it: Obama took office after the Great Recession began in December 2007. The Federal Reserve at that time put historically low interest rates in place, and took other measures besides, in an effort to inject money into the faltering economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump may want to Make America Great Again, but he\u2019s also showing a talent for making the markets nervous. Overnight, the president has launched a new barrage at America\u2019s central bank, accusing it of being too trigger-happy when raising US interest rates. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump intensified his criticism of the Federal Reserve and its chairman Jerome Powell, for hiking borrowing costs. It\u2019s all terribly unfair, the president griped, saying: I\u2019m just saying this: I\u2019m very unhappy with the Fed because Obama had zero interest rates. Every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates.\u201d In another jibe, the president added that Powell \u201calmost looks like he\u2019s happy raising interest rates\u201d, even though it could threaten EU economic growth. And when asked if he regretted making Powell America\u2019s top central banker last year, Trump replied: Too early to tell, but maybe.\u201d These comments are totally at odds with the principle of central bank independence. The Fed is meant to be free to change monetary policy to manage inflation and employment without worrying about a blast from the White House. So far this year the Fed has raised interest rates three times; Trump\u2019s attacks sound like an attempt to ward off a fourth hike in December. Reaction to follow... Also coming up today Stocks may be volatile again today, as October continues to be a testing time for investors. Asia-Pacific markets have risen today after Tuesday\u2019s sell-off, and we\u2019re expecting Europe to open higher - after the FTSE 100 hit a seven-month low last night. Italy will be in focus, after being given three weeks to resubmit its 2019 budget for EU approval. Rome insists there is no Plan B, though, so further clashes seem inevitable.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New York is suing the oil giant ExxonMobil in a lawsuit that claims the company engaged in a \u201clongstanding fraudulent scheme\u201d to downplay the risks posed to its business by climate change regulations. The legal action, launched by New York state attorney general Barbara Underwood, alleges that ExxonMobil deceived its investors by hiding the true extent of its financial exposure to laws aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Exxon provided \u201cfalse and misleading assurances\u201d to shareholders that it had factored in climate regulations and that its vast reserves of oil and gas weren\u2019t at major risk of being left as stranded assets, New York\u2019s lawsuit claims. Senior executives, including former chief executive Rex Tillerson, who was briefly US secretary of state in the Trump administration before being abruptly fired earlier this year, took part in this facade, the lawsuit states. The suit, lodged in the New York supreme court, comes after three years of investigation into Exxon by attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts. Exxon has previously attempted to block an investigation into its practices, claiming its first amendment rights were being violated. Underwood said: \u201cInvestors put their money and their trust in Exxon \u2013 which assured them of the long-term value of their shares, as the company claimed to be factoring the risk of increasing climate change regulation into its business decisions. Yet as our investigation found, Exxon often did no such thing. \u201cInstead, Exxon built a facade to deceive investors into believing that the company was managing the risks of climate change regulation to its business when, in fact, it was intentionally and systematically underestimating or ignoring them, contrary to its public representations.\u201d New York\u2019s lawsuit paints a picture of corporate malfeasance whereby Exxon told investors it was applying a \u201cproxy cost\u201d to its extraction of fossil fuels to account for the risk of governmental action to address climate change. In practice, the lawsuit alleges, Exxon applied much lower proxy costs than it initially stated, essentially assuming that existing climate regulations would remain in place, unchanged. This led to inaccurate information about investments in major projects, such as Exxon\u2019s oil sands operations in Alberta, Canada, the lawsuit states. Canada has recently outlined a national plan to put a price on carbon dioxide pollution in a bid to reduce emissions. Exxon\u2019s role in covering up the impact of climate change has come to light in the recent years, with the company aware for decades about the consequences of burning fossil fuels only to downplay this in public. The company now says it accepts climate change is real and a threat, even pledging $1m toward a campaign to put a price on carbon. This support comes with the caveat that mounting lawsuits aimed at making Exxon pay for damage wrought by climate change are dismissed. In July, a federal judge kicked out a lawsuit lodged by New York City that took aim at the five major oil producers, including Exxon. The New York state lawsuit does not concern the impact of climate change, but rather Exxon\u2019s role in communicating the risk of climate regulation to investors. \u201cBig oil may finally face some consequences for its role in wrecking the climate,\u201d said Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate campaign group 350.org. \u201cThe New York attorney general is standing up for investors who may have been swindled, and indirectly for the seven billion of us who will suffer from Exxon\u2019s lies.\u201d Exxon was contacted for comment. Attorneys general in California and Illinois, asked if they would join the New York suit, said they planned to take a \u201cclose look\u201d at the securities fraud law the state is suing under. The case, \u201chas been a topic of mutual conversation among various state AGs, and we are all going to take a close look at the filing,\u201d California attorney general Xavier Becerra said. California would need to consider how its own laws apply, Becerra said. In Illinois, the power to join this type of case lies with the secretary of state, attorney general Lisa Madigan explained. She said: \u201cThe overall message here is that Exxon and others that were really at the forefront of causing climate change conditions in our country and around the world long knew that this was taking place and withheld that information to the detriment of not just their investors but ultimately all of us around the country.\u201d",

Yet as our investigation found, Exxon often did no such thing.</p> <p>\u201cInstead, Exxon built a facade to deceive investors into believing that the company was managing the risks of climate change regulation to its business when, in fact, it was intentionally and systematically underestimating or ignoring them, contrary to its public representations.\u201d</p> <p>New York\u2019s lawsuit paints a picture of corporate malfeasance whereby Exxon told investors it was applying a \u201cproxy cost\u201d to its extraction of fossil fuels to account for the risk of governmental action to address climate change. In practice, the lawsuit alleges, Exxon applied much lower proxy costs than it initially stated, essentially assuming that existing climate regulations would remain in place, unchanged.</p> <p>This led to inaccurate information about investments in major projects, such as Exxon\u2019s oil sands operations in Alberta, Canada, the lawsuit states. Canada has recently outlined a national plan to put a price on carbon dioxide pollution in a bid to reduce emissions.</p> <p>Exxon\u2019s role in covering up the impact of climate change has come to light in the recent years, with the company aware for decades about the consequences of burning fossil fuels only to downplay this in public.</p> <p>The company now says it accepts climate change is real and a threat, even pledging $1m toward a campaign to put a price on carbon.</p> <p>This support comes with the caveat that mounting lawsuits aimed at making Exxon pay for damage wrought by climate change are dismissed.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has pledged to give tenants access to the government\u2019s new rogue landlord database after a Guardian and ITV News investigation revealed that not a single name had been entered into the system in more than six months since its launch \u2013 and that even when landlords\u2019 names were listed, the public would not be allowed to see them. In a swift U-turn, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said on Wednesday: \u201cOur rogue landlord database has only been in place since April and has been warmly welcomed by councils as an important enforcement tool. \u201cAs we have said, only offences committed from April this year can be included, and it can take several months to secure convictions. We are clear that we expect to see entries in the database from the new year. We also intend to make information in the database available to prospective and existing tenants.\u201d The government estimated before the launch of the database that there were 10,500 rogue landlords operating in England, and said it expected more than 600 of the worst offenders to be entered into the system. Before the change in policy, the contents of the database had been planned to be kept secret from the public. The government said it was \u201cnot in the public interest\u201d to explain why that decision had been made. The secrecy and sparsity of the central government rogue landlord database had contrasted sharply with a separate project run by the mayor of London\u2019s office. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the capital\u2019s online \u201crogue landlord checker\u201d was available to all Londoners and had received more than 1,000 entries from local authorities, although only around 300 are currently viewable as entries expire after a year. He said: \u201cMillions of renters have to put up with totally unacceptable conditions and the government is failing to do what\u2019s necessary to overhaul the outdated system. The government must step up to help renters.\u201d The central government system also possesses much tougher rules for local authorities to enter records of rogue landlords, and some housing experts wonder how many names will eventually make it into the system. John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said: \u201cIt beggars belief \u2013 six months after its launch \u2013 that none of the more than 10,000 rogue landlords ministers said should be named and shamed have yet been put on their database. \u201cIt\u2019s not just renters who lose out when the minister lets landlords off the hook. Taxpayers pay the price too, when millions are being spent on housing benefit to bad landlords letting dangerous accommodation.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s announcement, which did not give a time frame for the move, came as the government\u2019s efforts to police rogue landlords were branded weak following further revelations that found convicted landlords were continuing to operate by exploiting loopholes in the law, which is supposed to protect the most vulnerable tenants. The Guardian and ITV News revealed on Tuesday that rogue landlords were collecting rent, often funded by taxpayers via housing benefit, despite convictions for housing offences and failing to pass the \u201cfit and proper\u201d person tests required by housing legislation in England and Wales. Because of the way the law is written, this is usually perfectly legal. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, said: \u201cIt is clear from this investigation that this legislation is too weak and is not being properly enforced. There\u2019s no justification for treating rogue landlords more lightly than other people who break the law.\u201d Housing experts have joined the politicians by also calling for a review of the legislation designed to police the private rented sector. Julie Rugg, a senior research fellow at the University of York\u2019s Centre for Housing Policy, has suggested that the government should rewrite housing legislation from scratch, while a landlord trade body called on Wednesday for a thorough overhaul of the current system. The Residential Landlords Association said councils should use existing powers to ask tenants in rented homes to identify their landlord on their council tax returns, to help prevent rogue landlords from evading scrutiny. The trade body also said that a new housing court should be established to more quickly and effectively deal with cases. While there are numerous pieces of legislation that could be used against rogue landlords, critics say the law contains loopholes and that councils do not always have the resources to effectively enforce. According to the tax and spending thinktank IFS, overall local authority housing budgets are down 53% in real terms between 2009-10 to 2017-18, having dropped from \u00a33.2 billion to \u00a31.5 billion in 2017-18 prices.",

      "bodyText": "The convicted former UBS trader Kweku Adoboli faces imminent deportation to Ghana after a judge rejected his latest appeal to remain in the UK. Adoboli sought permission in the immigration court to judicially review the refusal of his latest application to remain in the UK. But judge Mark Ockelton rejected his claim in the strongest possible terms. The 38-year-old was jailed for seven years in 2012 after being found guilty of fraud that cost UBS $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn). He was released after serving half his sentence. Although he was born in Ghana, he left when he was four and has lived in the UK since he was 12. Adoboli\u2019s legal team argued that after he served his sentence for banking fraud he had dedicated himself to public speaking and hosting workshops about improving probity in the finance sector and warning people against making the kind of errors he made while working for UBS. He has been working with the Forward Institute, which promotes responsible leadership in business and society and evidence of this work was submitted to the court. But Ockelton rejected these arguments and said Adoboli had been \u201ctalking up\u201d his contribution to improving ethical behaviour in the business world. \u201cAlthough assertions are made about his value there is nothing in this material which shows a unique or weighty contribution in the public interest,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no empirical statement of what difference his absence would actually make.\u201d He said that if Adoboli wanted to continue giving talks he could do so via video-link from Ghana. As well as rejecting the judicial review application the judge also refused his legal team permission to appeal against his decision in the court of appeal and ordered that he paid almost \u00a32,000 costs incurred by the Home Office for participating in the case. Adoboli and his supporters appeared distraught after the hearing. Adoboli said: \u201cToday\u2019s hearing felt like a second [criminal] trial. I have worked really hard for the last seven years, firstly to right my wrongs and also to help people learn why these things happen. None of this has been done to absolve myself of what I did. This judgment casts aspersions about my character which I completely disagree with. This is incredibly distressing. I have lived here for 26 years. My identity is British.\u201d He added that he was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d that the judge had found against him on every single point. He vowed to fight on to remain in the UK. Adoboli has the support of his girlfriend, Alice Gray, and a large group of friends and colleagues who have been campaigning for his right to remain in the UK. More than 130 cross-party MPs and MSPs signed a letter to the home secretary calling on him to allow Adoboli to remain in the UK. \u201cWe are fighting for life, love and family,\u201d he said. His legal team is considering next steps in his case. As a foreign national given a jail sentence of more than four years, Adoboli is subject to automatic deportation under UK immigration laws unless \u201ccompelling\u201d circumstances can be argued to prevent such a removal. In his recent report (pdf) into immigration detention, the former prisons ombudsman Stephen Shaw described the Home Office policy to deport people who had committed crimes but had grown up in the UK as \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and called for the practice to end. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are pleased that the court ruled in our favour and has upheld our decision in this case.\u201d",

He has been working with the <a href=\"mailto:https://www.forward.institute\">Forward Institute</a>, which promotes responsible leadership in business and society and evidence of this work was submitted to the court.</p> <p>But Ockelton rejected these arguments and said Adoboli had been \u201ctalking up\u201d his contribution to improving ethical behaviour in the business world.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough assertions are made about his value there is nothing in this material which shows a unique or weighty contribution in the public interest,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no empirical statement of what difference his absence would actually make.\u201d</p> <p>He said that if Adoboli wanted to continue giving talks he could do so via video-link from Ghana.</p> <p>As well as rejecting the judicial review application the judge also refused his legal team permission to appeal against his decision in the court of appeal and ordered that he paid almost \u00a32,000 costs incurred by the Home Office for participating in the case.</p> <p>Adoboli and his supporters appeared distraught after the hearing.</p> <p>Adoboli said: \u201cToday\u2019s hearing felt like a second [criminal] trial. I have worked really hard for the last seven years, firstly to right my wrongs and also to help people learn why these things happen. None of this has been done to absolve myself of what I did. This judgment casts aspersions about my character which I completely disagree with. This is incredibly distressing. I have lived here for 26 years. My identity is British.\u201d</p> <p>He added that he was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d that the judge had found against him on every single point.</p> <p>He vowed to fight on to remain in the UK. Adoboli has the support of his girlfriend, Alice Gray, and a large group of friends and colleagues who have been campaigning for his right to remain in the UK. More than 130 cross-party MPs and MSPs signed a letter to the home secretary calling on him to allow Adoboli to remain in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cWe are fighting for life, love and family,\u201d he said.</p> <p>His legal team is considering next steps in his case. As a foreign national given a jail sentence of more than four years, Adoboli is subject to automatic deportation under UK immigration laws unless \u201ccompelling\u201d circumstances can be argued to prevent such a removal.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/728376/Shaw_report_2018_Final_web_accessible.pdf\">recent report (pdf)</a> into immigration detention, the former prisons ombudsman Stephen Shaw described the Home Office policy to deport people who had committed crimes but had grown up in the UK as \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and called for the practice to end.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are pleased that the court ruled in our favour and has upheld our decision in this case.\u201d&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p>",

      "bodyText": "Activist shareholders in Australia\u2019s largest independent coalminer are expected to vote in record numbers on Thursday to demand Whitehaven Coal aligns its long-term company strategy with the Paris climate agreement. Guardian Australia understands the group Market Forces has secured support from some superannuation funds and large overseas investors in Whitehaven for three resolutions that will be put to the company\u2019s annual general meeting in Sydney. Will van der Pol, a legal researcher and campaigner at Market Forces, said investors had been \u201creceptive\u201d in recent discussions. One non-binding advisory resolution calls on the company to disclose climate change-related risks to shareholders, in line with recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures. Another proposal says that shareholders call on the board to make strategy and capital expenditure decisions \u201cconsistent with the climate goals of the Paris agreement\u201d in order to safeguard the longer-term success of the company and respond to risks and opportunities posed by climate change. \u201cWe move this resolution in order to ensure our company is protected from stranded asset risks, and poised to take advantage of regulatory and market changes as international action is taken to satisfy the goals established by the Paris climate change agreement,\u201d a supporting statement says. \u201cGiven the higher stranding risk of coal assets over oil and gas, coal producers should be acting more urgently than other fossil fuel producers. \u201cPresently, Whitehaven Coal does not appear to have its strategy aligned with a scenario consistent with holding global warming below 2C. We consider this dangerous, given it amounts to second-guessing the ambition of 197 nations that signed the Paris agreement.\u201d Any substantial level of support would be significant, considering Whitehaven is a pure-play coalminer. The company released a statement to the ASX on 5 October that indicated it would consider climate risk reporting in 2019, a move interpreted as a concession to activist shareholders. It followed an Australian Securities and Investments Commission report last month critical of the level of climate risk disclosures by companies. \u201cWhitehaven is committed to playing a role in reducing carbon emissions ... by promoting increased use of Whitehaven\u2019s high-quality, low-emissions coal,\u201d the company said in its statement to the ASX. Whitehaven\u2019s future planning is based on the \u201cNew Policies Scenario\u201d of the International Energy Agency, under which coal demand to Asia would double by 2040. Under that scenario, global warming would increase to about 2.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Under a Paris baseline scenario modelled by the IEA, international demand for thermal coal would halve by 2040. Van de Pol said the resolutions at Thursday\u2019s Whitehaven AGM were \u201can opportunity for investors to make their mark and say this is exactly what we expect companies to be doing\u201d. \u201cThese sorts of resolutions are about the long-term sustainability of these companies,\u201d he said. Climate activists have increasingly switched from the coalface to the boardroom in recent years, where campaigns for large investors to divest from fossil fuels have gathered pace. At last week\u2019s AGM for the Queensland-based freight rail company Aurizon, investor proxies asked repeated questions about the company\u2019s role in hauling coal and its potential to support operations in the Galilee Basin. The Aurizon chairman, Tim Poole, told the meeting the company\u2019s coal freight rail network had a higher risk profile than other utilities and that the company was concerned about \u201cstranded asset risk\u201d. \u201cAt some point in the next 50 years, renewable energy might be such that we might not be hauling as much thermal coal as we are today ... part of our system might not be required,\u201d Poole said.",

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday Scott Morrison announced he was going to get tough on electricity prices. And while the policy may have an impact on prices, as ever under this current government, it remains completely ignorant of the urgent need to do something to reduce emissions. It was a big policy moment for the prime minister as he boldly stated that he had taken on board the recommendations from the ACCC\u2019s inquiry into retail electricity affordability and was going to finally do something to bring down power prices. The big ticket item was a default price. Essentially this would see power companies replace their \u201cstanding offer\u201d against which most of their discount rates are compared with a \u201cdefault price\u201d that would be set by the regulator. The problem as the ACCC noted is that \u201cthe market has evolved in such a way that standing offers, which were originally intended as a default protection for consumers who were not engaged in the market, have been used by retailers as a high-priced benchmark from which their advertised market offers are derived\u201d. And so prime minister Morrison told the assembled media that \u201cwe\u2019re adopting the ACCC\u2019s proposal to establish a default market offer; a price expectation that will give consumers a clear picture of how much they should be paying for their electricity.\u201d He continued saying, \u201cby setting a default market offer from which all discounts must be calculated, consumers will be able easily to compare offers from different companies and recognise when they\u2019re being ripped off or when they\u2019re getting a fair deal. They\u2019ll also be able to take up a default offer safe in the knowledge that they are not being gouged\u201d. Oh wait. Sorry, that was not prime minister Scott Morrison, it was prime minister Malcolm Turnbull on 20 August when he announced he was dumping the national energy guarantee and was introducing new measures to bring down power prices. Four days later he was no longer prime minister. On Tuesday prime minister Morrison, who on 20 August was standing next to Turnbull, announced that the government would be introducing a \u201cprice safety net\u201d (ie default) which \u201cwill stop big power companies ripping off loyal customers who don\u2019t have time to shop around for a better deal\u201d. The government is charging the Australian Energy Regulator to come up with this default price by the end of April next year, and it will come into effect from 1 July 2019. In the meantime (because there will be an election between now and then) the government will write to energy companies \u201cto take action to lower prices, specifically their standing offers by January 1\u201d. If at this point you are still wondering why Turnbull is no longer prime minister, given the energy policy announced this week was pretty much a reheat of the one Turnbull announced, and which apparently was the tipping point that saw him lose his job, take a number. It\u2019s obvious why electricity prices are such a big deal. In Sydney over the past two years only tobacco has gone up by more than electricity prices: But the problem is not just the past two years. Electricity prices once rose along with inflation, but since 2007, they have bounded ahead: In the past 10 years, average rental prices in Sydney have risen by 47%, while electricity prices have gone up 127%: In the same time private sector wages in NSW have risen by just 31%. So will this new policy work? And will it work as well as Morrison hopes? One difference between Turnbull and Morrison is that Turnbull was rather more circumspect about how much this could reduce prices. Turnbull told the media that \u201cthe ACCC estimates that for average customers\u201d the savings from moving to a default market offer \u201ccould range between $183 and $416\u201d. Morrison instead cited figures by the Australian Energy Market Commission \u201cthat customers on standing offers could be paying up to $832 per year more than the cheapest market offer in some regions.\u201d That is a big difference, and in his press conference he gave a few more details when he noted that \u201cthe savings for residential consumers range from $273 in the ACT, through to $832 in savings in South Australia.\u201d But even here we need a fair bit of caution. While those are the numbers provided by the AEMC, they apply to those who are on the median standard offer and who switch to the cheapest available option. Most people however are not on the standard offer. The ACCC found that in Victoria only 6% of customers were on the standard offer, 15% in NSW, 16% in South Australia and 12% in south east Queensland. So those hoping for a $800 reduction in electricity prices are most likely going to be sadly disappointed. That doesn\u2019t mean it is a bad policy; just that in these matters it is better to under-promise and over-deliver (especially when there is no hope of delivering anything before the next election). The policy may have problems for smaller energy companies who may struggle to operate with a higher default price, and thus it may lead to the further entrenchment of the big players such as AGL and Origin. What it won\u2019t do is help reduce emissions. Morrison and energy minister Angus Taylor ensured the climate-change-policy ignorance remains the standard for the Liberal party by suggesting it could indemnify new coal fired power generators against a future carbon price. Not content with trashing our emissions policies under their own government, they seem desperate to ensure the stench of their ignorance remains long after their time in power is over. And this is a big issue because as the OECD noted in a report released last month, Australia is doing worse than all but one nation in the OECD when it comes to properly factoring in a price on carbon: The report found that \u201cgovernments need to raise carbon prices much faster if they are to meet their commitments on cutting emissions and slowing the pace of climate change under the Paris Agreement.\u201d Astonishingly it found that across the OECD at the current pace, \u201ccarbon prices will only meet real costs in 2095\u201d. But don\u2019t worry, under this government of climate change denial the only talk is of \u201cfair dinkum\u201d power \u201cthat works when the sun doesn\u2019t shine and the wind doesn\u2019t blow\u201d, and remains in utter ignorance that the industry has moved past them with a number of battery projects such as the Tesla battery in South Australia which offer dispatchable power. The government\u2019s big energy plan is really a relic of the past \u2013 in some ways a past of just two months ago, but in the broader context, one much older, and which in a world of rising emissions and a shift to renewals is completely past its use by date. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

In Sydney over the past two years only tobacco has gone up by more than electricity prices:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Selected large price increases in Sydney, past 2 years\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/K5APQ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the problem is not just the past two years. Electricity prices once rose along with inflation, but since 2007, they have bounded ahead:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Index of electricity prices &amp; CPI in Sydney, Melbourne &amp; Adelaide\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iaDDv/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the past 10 years, average rental prices in Sydney have risen by 47%, while electricity prices have gone up 127%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Index of electricity prices &amp; rents in Sydney\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BRyuz/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the same time private sector wages in NSW have risen by just 31%.</p> <p>So will this new policy work? And will it work as well as Morrison hopes? </p> <p>One difference between Turnbull and Morrison is that Turnbull was rather more circumspect about how much this could reduce prices.</p> <p>Turnbull told the media that \u201cthe ACCC estimates that for average customers\u201d the savings from moving to a default market offer \u201ccould range between $183 and $416\u201d.</p> <p>Morrison instead <a href=\"https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22media/summary/summary.w3p;query=Source%3A%22PRIME%20MINISTER%22\">cited</a> figures by the Australian Energy Market Commission \u201cthat customers on standing offers could be paying up to $832 per year more than the cheapest market offer in some regions.\u201d</p> <p>That is a big difference, and in <a href=\"https://www.pm.gov.au/media/press-conference-minister-energy\">his press conference</a> he gave a few more details when he noted that \u201cthe savings for residential consumers range from $273 in the ACT, through to $832 in savings in South Australia.\u201d</p> <p>But even here we need a fair bit of caution. While those are the numbers<a href=\"https://2018.aemc.gov.au/competition-review/\"> provided by the AEMC</a>, they apply to those who are on the median standard offer and who switch to the cheapest available option. </p> <p>Most people however are not on the standard offer. The ACCC found that in Victoria only 6% of customers were on the standard offer, 15% in NSW, 16% in South Australia and 12% in south east Queensland.</p> <p>So those hoping for a $800 reduction in electricity prices are most likely going to be sadly disappointed. That doesn\u2019t mean it is a bad policy; just that in these matters it is better to under-promise and over-deliver (especially when there is no hope of delivering anything before the next election).</p> <p>The policy may have problems for smaller energy companies who may struggle to operate with a higher default price, and thus it may lead to the further entrenchment of the big players such as AGL and Origin. </p> <p>What it won\u2019t do is help reduce emissions. </p> <p>Morrison and energy minister Angus Taylor ensured the climate-change-policy ignorance remains the standard for the Liberal party by suggesting it could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/24/coalition-could-indemnify-new-coal-projects-against-potential-carbon-price\">indemnify new coal fired power generators</a> against a future carbon price. Not content with trashing our emissions policies under their own government, they seem desperate to ensure the stench of their ignorance remains long after their time in power is over.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/22/coalition-asks-regulator-to-intervene-on-electricity-prices\">Coalition asks regulator to intervene on electricity prices</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And this is a big issue because as the OECD noted in a report released <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/few-countries-are-pricing-carbon-high-enough-to-meet-climate-targets.htm\">last month</a>, Australia is doing worse than all but one nation in the OECD when it comes to properly factoring in a price on carbon:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Carbon pricing gap for OECD nations (2015)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OpKMj/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The report found that \u201cgovernments need to raise carbon prices much faster if they are to meet their commitments on cutting emissions and slowing the pace of climate change under the Paris Agreement.\u201d Astonishingly it found that across the OECD at the current pace, \u201ccarbon prices will only meet real costs in 2095\u201d.</p> <p>But don\u2019t worry, under this government of climate change denial the only talk is of \u201cfair dinkum\u201d power \u201cthat works when the sun doesn\u2019t shine and the wind doesn\u2019t blow\u201d, and remains in utter ignorance that the industry has moved past them with a <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-05/port-augusta-becomes-australian-renewable-energy-hub/10338812\">number</a> of <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/watershed-moment-victoria-launches-first-grid-scale-battery-20181024-p50bjd.html\">battery</a> projects such as the Tesla battery in South Australia which offer <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-02/tesla-battery-proves-a-leading-source-of-dispatchable-power/10326420\">dispatchable power</a>. &#xa0;</p> <p>The government\u2019s big energy plan is really a relic of the past \u2013 in some ways a past of just two months ago, but in the broader context, one much older, and which in a world of rising emissions and a shift to renewals is completely past its use by date<a href=\"xhttp://www.theguardian.com\">.</a></p> <p>\u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shareholder activists have asked Qantas to review its policy of facilitating forced deportations, saying it could harm the airline\u2019s reputation and share values. On Friday, Qantas shareholders will vote on a motion that asks the company to review its policy of transporting asylum seekers and refugees who have been forcibly deported by the Australian government. Currently, the airline transports people if requested by the Department of Home Affairs but critics say many refused refugees have not been properly assessed, in what could be a violation of international law. The motion comes after multiple protests against the airline\u2019s role including one during an award sponsored by the airline. Ahead of the vote, two proxy adviser groups, and one investor, have said Qantas should review its policies. Proxy advisers give recommendations to shareholders about whether to vote for certain resolutions, based on how they will affect share prices and other factors. One group, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, which invests the cash from retirement funds, is advising its shareholders to support the motion in its entirety, even though the Qantas board opposes it. Two of the proxy advisers have recommended the motion should be opposed, but still asked for a review. CGI Glass Lewis told shareholders to vote against the motion but warned that Qantas is \u201cexposed to certain human rights-related risks\u201d. \u201cAllegations of human rights abuses can inflict, at a minimum, reputational damage and may dramatically affect shareholder value \u2026 We believe that a thorough review of how this issue is being handled would be in the best interests of shareholders.\u201d Another adviser, Regnan, also backed a review in principle. \u201cWe are broadly supportive of calls for the company to review its policies and processes associated with this issue,\u201d it said. But it found other parts of the motion \u2013 which called for the report to be given to shareholders \u2013 went too far, and advised a no vote. Qantas has consistently stated it would not refuse deportations because government and courts were better placed to decide on immigration matters. But Regnan\u2019s advice was critical of the company line, saying it was a risk to portray Qantas as \u201ccaptive\u201d to the government. \u201cWe are concerned about Qantas\u2019 statement that declining to provide service would amount to \u2018undermining the Australian government\u2019 \u2026 We do not see it as consistent with investor interests for commercial decisions to be, or to be presented as, captive to priorities set by government(s).\u201d A Qantas spokesperson told Guardian Australia: \u201cQantas shareholders will have their say on the matter at our annual general meeting this week. We expect these groups to respect the outcome of the vote. \u201cThese are very complex and emotive matters but it\u2019s not for airlines to adjudicate on who should and shouldn\u2019t get to stay in Australia after the government and courts have made their decisions.\u201d The resolution is being proposed by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility and its director, Brynn O\u2019Brien welcomed the advice of the proxy advisors. \u201cIt simply makes no business sense that an insignificant part of Qantas\u2019s business is exposing them to the real risk of involvement in human rights abuses, and very significant brand damage. The best way for Qantas to manage this risk is simply to stop doing removals work on behalf of the Australian government.\u201d Sarah Dale, the principal solicitor for the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, also called on Qantas to halt its role in the deportations. \u201cWhile the airline participates in involuntary transportation of vulnerable people, it is likely complicit in the violation of international standards,\u201d she said. \u201cContrary to what Qantas says, the human rights of refugees and people seeking asylum are no longer adequately protected by Australian law or the government \u2026 Over the last 12 months we have seen an increase in returns of people in circumstances where international legal standards have not been followed.\u201d Internationally, other airlines have refused to deport refugees or immigrants on government orders. In the UK, Virgin Atlantic has refused to deport immigrants after a spate of wrongful removals known as the Windrush scandal. In the US, United and American airlines have refused to carry immigrant children separated from their parents under new government policies. In Germany, pilots for Lufthansa have also refused to deport unwilling asylum seekers due to a range of reasons, with government figures claiming 222 deportations failed last year due to pilots refusing to take off. In Australia, Virgin Australia also facilitates forced deportations.",

The picture that he has painted (Are dark kitchens the satanic mills of our era?, 9 October) is not something I, nor my team, recognise. The kitchens we work together with Deliveroo to create are chef-led, high-quality, open and optimised for delivery as our chefs work alongside Deliveroo\u2019s teams to ensure that every health and safety regulation is met and comfort levels are taken into account. It\u2019s such a luxury to be able to have kitchens where our teams can focus on building great products specifically for the delivery market. Creating these kitchens has allowed us to expand rapidly into areas previously impossible for a small, growing business with no institutional investment. By opening these dedicated delivery units across London, we have been able to: circumvent extortionate premiums (costs paid to existing leaseholders to take over a property), which have been driven into the hundreds of thousands of pounds by the many fast casual chains across the city; ameliorate the incredible expense of building and fitting out our own kitchens; and outsource the operational headache of managing a fleet of delivery drivers, while expanding our reach and delivering the best possible fried chicken we can across as much of London as possible. It is a shame that we couldn\u2019t open several 3,000 sq ft, open-kitchen dining rooms with purpose-built delivery stations across central London in a single calendar year, but such is the nature of cashflow and consequently the incredible opportunity in delivery. Blaming the product of a system that requires a low-overhead model is no way to open a discourse. Rents in central London are staggeringly high, business rates are continuing to rise, the cost of goods are rising above the rate of inflation, interest rates are going up, making financing a less viable option, the impending doom and uncertainty of Brexit has created an unfavourable investment economy, and it\u2019s more difficult than ever to recruit great team members. Delivery kitchens are just one response to these barriers; they are a great way to grow our business and expand our product offering without consolidating too much risk into a single location. Yes, the way people eat is changing. The ways people do a lot of things are changing. That\u2019s not something to panic about, it\u2019s something to embrace and accept. It brings with it new challenges and new opportunities that we are excited to chase and which allow us to keep serving Londoners the best fried chicken we can across the city.

Rents in central London are staggeringly high, business rates are continuing to rise, the cost of goods are rising above the rate of inflation, interest rates are going up, making financing a less viable option, the impending doom and uncertainty of Brexit has created an unfavourable investment economy, and it\u2019s more difficult than ever to recruit great team members. Delivery kitchens are just one response to these barriers; they are a great way to grow our business and expand our product offering without consolidating too much risk into a single location.</p> <p>Yes, the way people eat is changing. The ways people do a lot of things are changing. That\u2019s not something to panic about, it\u2019s something to embrace and accept. It brings with it new challenges and new opportunities that we are excited to chase and which allow us to keep serving Londoners the best fried chicken we can across the city.<br><strong>Brittney Bean</strong><br><em>Co-founder of Mother Clucker </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here to upload it</em></strong></a><strong><em> and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Mill View tower is a grey, postwar, former council-owned block of flats which rises above Toxteth to the south of Liverpool city centre. At first sight it is unremarkable by the standards of many British cities. The 16-storey building, containing 64 flats, is of a model that 1960s planners replicated across UK inner cities. But this tower has one big claim to notoriety: it was the most prosecuted building on Housing Act charges last year. Look a little deeper and Mill View tells another story too. It illustrates how housing once owned and managed by local councils to accommodate vulnerable and low-income tenants has become an international asset class attracting overseas investors seeking big returns. Conditions in the block were poor in 2016 according to Liverpool city council, with temperatures inside judged to potentially be a risk to tenants\u2019 health. Local managing agent Elite Property Management and Lettings Ltd was prosecuted on 13 separate licensing charges last year. Elite pleaded guilty, and the case left Mill View with more Housing Act prosecutions than any other building in England and Wales during 2017, according to data collected via freedom of information requests submitted by the Guardian and ITV News. But separately the tower block is also a bizarre tale of international property investment. Years before the city\u2019s environmental health officers discovered the heating was so bad the flats could be a threat to health, Mill View was owned by Liverpool city council. In 2012, as austerity measures bit, the local authority sold the block to developers, who refurbished it and sold the flats on to a string of international investors the following year. The process resulted in overseas speculators from countries including Russia, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Kenya owning around 80% of the block. When the council\u2019s inspectors called in 2016 only 12 flats were owned in the UK. Of the 13 Mill View flats that were the focus of the licensing prosecutions against Elite, only two were owned by UK-based investors (in London and Wolverhampton) at the start of the investigation. The remaining 11 were all held offshore, in jurisdictions ranging from the Isle of Man to Russia, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Dubai. The rent on all of the flats in the prosecutions came from housing benefit, which was being paid directly to Elite. The agent would take its cut before passing on the rent to its investor clients. One of the owners did not even bother to collect the rent. According to court documents, Elite\u2019s owner, Darren Sharkey, claimed: \u201cI believe [the previous agents] are still holding rent for all [of one landlord\u2019s] properties since he purchased them \u2026 He obviously has bigger fish to fry.\u201d It seems unlikely that many of the Mill View investors will have ever seen their assets \u2013 at least in any other way than via a line on a spreadsheet. Having paid around \u00a360,000 for a two-bedroom flat, each investor would have made a yield of roughly 8% a year from the housing benefit-funded rent. In around 13 years, therefore, the rent received would cover the purchase price of each apartment. Such calculations make it easier to understand how international property players could view housing benefit tenants as an investment asset class. These rough figures do not take into account management fees and also assume no maintenance spending on the properties \u2013 and there has been some investment since the prosecutions. Most of the apartments have been renovated since the environmental health officers intervened. More modern heaters have been installed to spare tenants from \u201chazards of excess cold\u201d. But not all the flats have been updated. Speaking to a Guardian journalist who was being shown around a revamped Saudi-owned apartment while posing as a prospective new tenant, more than a year after his firm\u2019s licensing conviction in June, Sharkey admitted: \u201cSome of the flats haven\u2019t got [the new heaters] yet because some of the owners haven\u2019t paid to have them done, because they are quite a cost \u2013 three and a half thousand pounds for those. Some of them have just got the old electric heaters, which are rubbish.\u201d The Saudi-owned flat did not form part of the licensing conviction. Elite has now applied for \u2013 and been granted \u2013 licences to manage 41 Mill View flats on behalf of its clients. Meanwhile, several flats in the block have been purchased by more local investors over the past couple of years, including Sharkey himself. He says he has been trying for years to improve conditions in the block, that already had a separate historical reputation for some criminality on the part of tenants. In 2013 police officers discovered a single floor where three out of the four flats were housing a cannabis farm. In one flat there was said to be product worth around six times the value of a single Mill View apartment. Sharkey said: \u201cWe have worked tirelessly to improve the condition of the flats when they became available and have worked on a scope of works to install heating recommended by council. \u201cOut of the 41 we currently manage there are approximately 12 that still require the heating upgrade, all of which I believe will be completed by early next year. There has been a delay to progress we made this year on installations due to original heaters being discontinued and a new range of heaters needing to be sourced. \u201cDuring the heating upgrade we faced significant challenges with access, as many of the tenants did not or would not allow us access.\u201d He suggested that costs such as the ground rents paid by the landlords meant that owning a Mill View flat was not as profitable as it appeared.",

      "bodyText": "A Liverpool tower block that had more housing prosecutions in 2017 than any other building was 80% owned by international investors, some of whom were banking publicly funded rents while subjecting tenants to potential danger from hazardously low temperatures. Mill View tower, a 16-storey former council-owned high rise in Toxteth, attracted 13 prosecutions last year for Elite Property Management and Lettings Ltd, a local firm that was managing 13 of the flats. The flats had cost around \u00a360,000 each in 2013 and were all rented to residents claiming housing benefit. The company was prosecuted for licensing offences. The discovery of the building\u2019s story \u2013 described as \u201cshocking\u201d by two local MPs \u2013 has prompted calls for some landlords to have their properties seized and housing benefit rental payments withheld. When environmental health officers inspected the block in April 2016, 11 out of the 13 flats that were later the focus of the prosecutions were owned by overseas investors \u2013 based as far away as Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Malaysia. In total, about 80% of the block was owned by international investors, with only 12 of the tower\u2019s 64 flats UK-owned, when the inspectors called. The investments were generating around 8% gross annual return, before service fees and upkeep, much of that provided by housing benefit payments. While much of the Mill View block has now been renovated, around one-fifth of the flats have still to have their heating upgraded, as tenants prepare to face the third winter since the issue was discovered. The investigations by the council discovered \u201chazards of excess cold\u201d, and showed that Elite had failed to obtain licences on the properties it was letting on behalf of its international clients. Elite was prosecuted 13 times for the licensing offences, giving the tower the most convictions under the Housing Act of any building in England and Wales last year, according to freedom of information requests made by the Guardian and ITV News. Frank Field, the independent MP for nearby Birkenhead and chairman of the work and pensions committee, said: \u201cIt is deeply shocking and depressing isn\u2019t it? I think it is another example of the weak underbelly of globalisation, where the government is defenceless in trying to defend tenants.\u201d Field said some landlords should have their property confiscated: \u201cThis is not just an isolated case. We have therefore got to build up an armoury to protect tenants in the weakest position. That includes withholding housing benefit from landlords and withdrawing their right to own and manage the property. Is it so shocking that these people should lose control over their property?\u201d Dame Louise Ellman, the Labour MP who represents the constituency in which Mill View is located, said: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking. It needs some kind of national legislation to stop this taking place.\u201d Joe Beswick, head of housing at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, described the fact that housing benefit has become an international investment opportunity, offering guaranteed returns, as absurd. \u201cThe offshoring of the private rented sector is just another layer of absurdity,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a relatively stable housing system where the government provided homes for people that couldn\u2019t access them through the market \u2026 we\u2019ve now gone to an unregulated system where rents are much higher because UK property has become such an attractive asset to international investors.\u201d Beswick added: \u201cA lot of those rents are finding their way into offshore accounts with, presumably, a higher level of tax avoided on taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d Mill View, he said, proved that the involvement of international investors in the UK property market \u2013 and the problems it had caused \u2013 were not confined to London. \u201cThe worst thing about it is that while the money is being ploughed in, it is not in any way productive. Investors\u2019 money is not being used to build more affordable homes, it is just being used to buy existing assets. It just increases the competition for homes and increases the cost of homes, with the people of the UK ending up with more expensive houses and no increase in the supply of houses.\u201d Darren Sharkey, the director of Elite, claimed that he did not feel he needed a licence and that the licensing system penalised good landlords but had been unsuccessful in removing \u201cvery many rogue landlords\u201d. He said: \u201cThe licence fine had nothing to do with [the] heating upgrade. There have been lots of other poor conditions in the building and there still needs to be further improvements, but again we have worked tirelessly to improve these issues, which has been borne out by the vast improvements in [the] condition of flats. Myself and many owners are now seeking to take over the management of the communal areas \u2026 as this is now where we feel the building needs greater levels of work.\u201d He claimed that costs such as the ground rents paid by the landlords meant that owning a Mill View flat was not as profitable as it appeared. Councillor Lynnie Hinnigan, a deputy mayor of Liverpool, said: \u201cWe were informed that none of the [Mill View] flats had a landlord licence. This was a foot in the door for us and we carried out inspections, which revealed tenants were living in cold conditions and spending a fortune trying to keep their flats warm due to inadequate and inefficient heating systems. \u201cWe served improvement notices and as a direct result many have had work carried out \u2013 and we will continue to enforce the notices to make sure the remainder are done. This is exactly why we introduced landlord licensing\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The most comprehensive ever survey of convicted landlords in England and Wales, carried out by the Guardian and ITV News, reveals that 502 landlords committed 752 housing offences in 2017. They were fined a total of \u00a32.7m \u2013 less than \u00a33,600 per offence. Many of the landlords were repeat offenders, with 123 convicted of multiple housing offences in the same year. The survey is based on FoI responses from more than three-quarters of councils in England and Wales with responsibility for the private rented sector. Highest fines in 2017 A letting agent who is claimed to have terrorised migrants living above a dangerous former pub owned by a property tycoon received the highest total amount of fines for housing offences last year, according to freedom of information requests made by the Guardian and ITV News. Jose Marcos Bispo Rodrigues and his company were fined a total of \u00a3190,500 in April 2017, our survey found. Rodrigues was subletting 15 small, sometimes windowless, rooms to at least 20 migrant workers and students above the former Castle pub in Plaistow, east London, according to court documents. The court heard that tenants lived in fear of Rodrigues because he had ripped off the door to one of the bedrooms to confront a man who could not afford an increase in the rent. The former pub, owned by luxury property developer Michael Docker\u2019s firm Castle Estates Limited, had no working fire alarm nor a fire door to prevent fire spreading from the kitchen. Docker was receiving \u00a33,800 a month in rent. Rodrigues and his firm, which is still trading, were convicted of 22 offences including failing to protect occupiers and failing to provide a safe means of escape. Newham council housing officer Paul Oatt, who inspected the property, said the pub was a \u201cdeath trap\u201d as tenants at the top of the building would have struggled to get out alive in the event of a fire. Rodrigues told the Guardian he knew nothing about the fine or breaking down a door. \u201cI do not know anything about a fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of anything. I\u2019m going to find out.\u201d Rodrigues did not respond to subsequent efforts to contact him. Rodrigues and his firm ML Arndt Rodrigues Ltd have not paid any of the record fine, which was imposed six months ago. The Ministry of Justice said the matter had been passed to bailiffs. Docker, who let the former pub to Rodrigues after he struggled to get planning permission, was fined \u00a33,825 for breaching the building\u2019s single-family licence and failing to produce a gas safety certificate. District judge Timothy Rose said Docker did not properly inspect his property. \u201cHe was the licensee; whether he \u2018likes it or not\u2019 he had the responsibility to ensure that he was complying with licence requirements and he cannot avoid that by stating that he left it all to others on his behalf,\u201d he wrote in his judgment. Docker also owns the Gracewood Group, which has built about 40 luxury residential schemes across east London worth more than \u00a3300m. The property developer claimed he ran his business in accordance with all residential statutory and regulatory requirements. \u201cThis was the only occasion that I have been prosecuted for a breach of a statutory requirement and I am saddened that this occurred due to a combination of tenant obstruction and administrative error,\u201d he said. The biggest single fine was imposed on Bewel Property Ltd, which was ordered to pay \u00a3150,000 in 2017 after a judge said live wiring and a rotten balcony in a Bayswater flat the company was renting out was endangering the lives of six \u201cyoung professionals\u201d, according to responses to the FoI requests made by the Guardian and ITV News. They were each paying around \u00a31,000 a month in rent. The sole director of Bewel, which owned the lease on the property at the time the offences were committed, was Jeffery Hu, who was fined \u00a35,000. He told the Guardian the fines were \u201cridiculous\u201d and denied the tenants lives had been put at risk. \u201cThat wire was not dangerous \u2013 it was dead. The leak from the roof \u2013 I could not do nothing about that. It was leaking a long time and it affected the damp in the living room.\u201d Hu insisted he could not be held responsible for the condition of the properties: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to fix everything on behalf of the landlord. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d That, however, was not Bewel\u2019s only offence. The firm was also fined \u00a350,000 in the same year for letting a dangerous three-storey property without a safe means of escape in Kensington and Chelsea. Hu was fined \u00a32,000 for not submitting gas certificates. Both Hu and Bewel are still operating in the central London rental market. Hu holds two licences for house shares in Westminster, while Bewel holds another. Most convictions Absentee landlord Mustafa Taghdi had the most convictions for both licensing and non-licensing offences in 2017. He pleaded guilty to renting out 16 unlicensed flats and houses in Liverpool and breaching two emergency prohibition orders \u2013 which are used by councils to prevent serious harm to tenants. Council officers ordered Taghdi, who lives in Libya but also resides in Portsmouth, to evacuate a three-storey house with multiple tenants that was without fire alarms and had a locked fire escape, but he ignored their warnings and left the building in a dangerous condition. Taghdi did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s efforts to contact him.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than one in seven councils in England and Wales have failed to prosecute a single bad landlord over the past three years, despite some having very high numbers of homes classed as \u201cnon-decent\u201d, the Guardian has found. Freedom of information responses show that 53 of the 349 local authorities with responsibility for the private rented sector did not convict any landlords for breaching property standards in 2015, 2016 or 2017. Some of these councils have thousands of private homes in poor states of disrepair and hundreds of illegal bedsit-style homes, which typically have the worst overcrowding and living conditions. The housing campaign group Advice4Renters estimates that only 0.1% of landlords letting non-decent homes are prosecuted each year. Merton in south London has an estimated 24,100 non-decent private rented and owner-occupied homes and 143 unlicensed large bedsits. However, the council did not prosecute any landlords between 2015 and 2017. Enfield in north London has 19,669 non-decent private-sector homes and 853 unlicensed large bedsits. It also failed to prosecute any landlords for renting out substandard property over the same period. Jill Harrison, the chief executive of Enfield Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB), said rogue landlords had little to fear in Enfield because the council did not have the resources to deal with the number of complaints from local renters, which has risen to around 1,000 a year. \u201cThere is a serious problem with disrepair in the borough. But there is very little disincentive for rogue landlords behaving in this way,\u201d she said. Harrison added that Enfield had the worst rate in London of tenants being threatened with eviction. Housing cases form 16% of her bureau\u2019s workload \u2013 double the norm for CABs across the country. \u201cThere are endemic disrepair issues in this borough: mould, damp, infestations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also have large houses being converted into bedsits. Lots of people are being charged through the nose for tiny rooms in poor states of repair because landlords make money by packing in as many people as possible.\u201d Harrison said Enfield was only able to deal with the worst examples of disrepair. \u201cThis means that an awful lot of people will continue to live in misery because the council does not enforce the less dreadful problems,\u201d she said. \u201cThey end up coming to us for help out of desperation because they can\u2019t get help from the council.\u201d The Mitcham and Morden MP Siobhain McDonagh, whose constituency includes parts of the borough of Merton, accused the council of ignoring non-decent housing. \u201cCouncils like Merton are looking the other way because they don\u2019t know what to do if they find these places. They don\u2019t have the environmental health officers or the capital funds to do works in default,\u201d she said. The number of officers enforcing rental property standards has fallen from from 10 to six since 2010. She said the lack of prosecutions was giving a green light to rogue landlords. \u201cIf people feel they won\u2019t be caught out for bad behaviour, it happens,\u201d she said. McDonagh acknowledged Merton had \u201cfinancial difficulties\u201d, but said \u201chousing has to be a priority because housing is a fundamental building block for adults\u2019 and children\u2019s lives\u201d. Other councils with no landlord convictions for three years included Tameside in Greater Manchester, where nearly 45% of private housing stock is classed as non-decent, and North Somerset, where the corresponding figure is close to 30%. The worst conditions in North Somerset are concentrated in the deprived parts of Weston-super-Mare. Enfield council said it had served an unprecedented number of notices on landlords since 2015 and that \u201ccompliance is achieved sometimes through advice, warnings and by co-operation\u201d. The council also said it had prosecuted three landlords this year. A Merton council spokesperson said: \u201cWe take our regulatory role \u2026 very seriously and work closely with private-sector landlords to improve conditions in the private rented sector in in our borough.\u201d Tameside council said most complaints were dealt with informally and that \u201cthe majority of landlords resolve the issues we identify during our inspections without the need to take enforcement action\u201d. North Somerset council said it was acting to improve poor quality private rented housing and that council intervention over the past year \u201cresulted in 80 homes in the private rented sector being improved through a combination of formal and informal action\u201d. Some of the councils without any landlord convictions for three years stressed they had relatively small private rented sectors with few problems. Others pointed to different types of enforcement action, such as issuing notices, or insisted that working with landlords achieved better results. North Somerset: \u2018I have to wash in cold water. I feel like a homeless man\u2019 Kevin Roberts has visual impairment and learning difficulties. He has to walk up three flights of unlit stairs to reach his top-floor rented flat in the centre of Weston-super-Mare and rarely leaves because he fears the climb back up. \u201cI\u2019m scared to go out. I just stay in here,\u201d he said. His brother John, who cares for him, worries he might fall. \u201cAs he\u2019s got older his eyesight has got worse but there\u2019s no lights all the way up the stairs. I\u2019m worried that he will fall down and break his neck.\u201d The rear door to the building cannot be locked. \u201cAnybody can just walk in,\u201d claimed John. \u201cI\u2019ve seen all sorts of people coming out. They looked like they had been drinking or taking drugs.\u201d Despite Kevin paying thousands of pounds in rent over the 30 years he has been there, John claims very little has been spent on the flat. According to John, the carpets have never been changed and there has been no hot water for years. \u201cI have to wash in cold water,\u201d said Kevin. \u201cI feel like a homeless man.\u201d John claims he complained to the council about his brother\u2019s living conditions about four years ago but no action was taken against the landlord. He contacted the council again this month and a housing officer found a litany of problems in the building, including a broken fire alarm, missing handrails and the unlockable entrance door. But the council decided to write to the landlord, informally, asking him to do the work by 20 November rather than take immediate enforcement action. \u201cWe got someone from the council to look at the place. But still nothing has happened. I feel disgusted,\u201d said John. North Somerset council said informal action produced quicker results than formal notices. \u201cIn this instance the landlord agreed to undertake the work and we understand they have engaged contractors and we will continue to monitor progress,\u201d it said. Kevin\u2019s landlord is John Woolls. His son Martin Woolls said in a statement on behalf of his father that the \u201cminor issues\u201d in Kevin\u2019s flat, including the unlit stairs, were in the process of being addressed. \u201cSince this complaint was raised by Kevin\u2019s brother my father has been corresponding with the council and I understand that workmen are currently working through the various minor issues,\u201d he stated. Woolls said Roberts had not looked after the property. \u201cIt is not unreasonable for landlords to expect that a tenant will at least take basic care of the properties that they rent. In Kevin\u2019s case this obviously does not happen,\u201d he claimed. Woolls said that the \u201cbad carpets\u201d in the flat belonged to Roberts as it was let unfurnished. He said the back door had been broken into many times and his father had repaired it on each occasion. Woolls said problems with the water heater should have been reported to his father as \u201cit would have been dealt with as soon as he knew about it\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Sterling remains flat as Brexit deal still not reached The pound held steady on the foreign exchanges over the past month amid a lack of progress in the Brexit talks, which hold the key to either a rally in the value of sterling or a further depreciation. Jon Cunliffe, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, warned of a \u201cbig fall\u201d in the pound should Britain fail to agree a deal with Brussels before formally leaving the EU on 29 March. Sterling has dropped by about a cent against the dollar in the past month to stand at $1.30. It remains more than 10% below the levels seen before the EU referendum in 2016. FTSE 100 hit by US interest rate fears Global markets plunged in the past month, fuelled by rising concern over the impact of the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates, which could trigger a slowdown in the world economy. The rapid buildup in debt since the last financial crisis has made the world more vulnerable to higher borrowing costs, which could trigger companies and nations defaulting on their debts as the Fed raises rates. Fears over a slowdown in the Chinese economy and the impact over the US-China trade war also had an impact. The FTSE 100, which includes many international companies, has lost 10% since its peak in May \u2013 the definition of a market correction. Better than forecast Falling food prices fuel inflation slowdown UK inflation dropped further than expected in September, as the falling price of meat and chocolate cut cash-strapped households some slack. The Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index (CPI) dropped to 2.4% last month from 2.7% in August, confounding economists\u2019 expectations for a modest reduction to 2.6%. The reading is likely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates, as it suggests inflation is gradually falling back towards its target of 2% set by the Treasury, without the need for higher borrowing costs. Worse than forecast Trade deficit widens as imports surge Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened more than expected with an increase in imports in August, outstripping the total value of UK goods sold to foreign buyers. The global goods trade deficit was \u00a311.2bn, having increased from \u00a310.4bn in July, which was worse than the \u00a310.9bn forecast by analysts. Despite a worse than expected month for British trade, the trade deficit for the year to August has narrowed by \u00a313.5bn. The goods deficit narrowed by \u00a35bn, while the UK\u2019s trade in services surplus widened by \u00a38.6bn. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics do not augur well for the health of UK trade after Brexit, with the data showing the EU contributed most to the narrowing of the trade in goods deficit. Better than forecast Business activity points towards resilient growth There were positive readings for the British economy from surveys of business activity, despite a slight drop in economic output for the country\u2019s dominant services sector. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index showed the services sector \u2013 which includes retail, hotels and transport and makes up 80% of the economy \u2013 dropped from 54.3 to 53.9 on a scale where anything above 50 indicates expansion. Economists said the slight loss of output meant the UK was still in line for GDP growth of about 0.4% in the third quarter, which was the same level as recorded in the second quarter. Better than forecast Pay growth hits highest levels since 2009 The lowest levels of official unemployment since the mid-70s finally appear to be handing British workers the bargaining power required to increase their wages, as the latest set of figures for the labour market showed regular pay growth \u2013 which excludes bonuses \u2013 hit 3.1% in the three months to August compared with a year ago \u2013 the strongest rise in almost a decade. Real average weekly earnings, accounting for inflation, still however lag the peak recorded before the financial crisis. Worse than forecast Abrupt slowdown in consumer spending A strong summer for Britain\u2019s retailers came to an abrupt end in September as weak demand for food hit supermarkets and dragged down spending overall. The volume of sales dropped by 0.8% in a month, which was twice the fall forecast by economists ahead of the figures being published. Retailers had a bumper few months, boosted by the warm weather and the World Cup; however, supermarkets recorded a 1.5% drop in food sales in September. Consumers have come under pressure from high levels of inflation since the EU referendum outcome triggered a drop in the value of the pound, pushing up the cost of imports to Britain. Better than forecast Public finances give Hammond budget boost Philip Hammond was handed a boost from the public finances ahead of the autumn budget, with a smaller than expected deficit in September. The difference between tax income and public spending narrowed to \u00a34.1bn compared with \u00a35bn in the same month a year ago. City economists in a Reuters poll had forecast a deficit of about \u00a34.5bn. So far this financial year, the deficit totals \u00a319.9bn, down 35% from April-September 2017 and the smallest total at this stage of the year since 2002. With the deficit falling further than expected, Hammond could be granted more wiggle room to increase public spending at the budget. Worse than forecast House price outlook worst since Brexit vote House price growth slowed across the country as British surveyors were shown to be the gloomiest about the outlook for property prices since the Brexit vote two years ago. The latest snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its headline house price balance fell to a four-month low of -2 in September, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll. Uncertainty relating to Britain leaving the EU in less than six months and a warning from Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, to Theresa May\u2019s cabinet that house prices could crash in the event of no-deal both had an impact. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 Will the Conservatives really end austerity? Theresa May raised some eyebrows when she promised to end austerity in her speech to the Conservative party conference, almost a decade after her party started the deep cuts to public services. Without tax rises or stronger economic growth \u2013 both of which are unlikely given Brexit \u2013 the pledge is unlikely to be compatible with the Tories\u2019 aim of generating a budget surplus by the mid 2020s. Austerity is currently set to continue for the UK\u2019s poorest households, who have been hit hardest by the policy, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. The average poor family with children will lose about \u00a3200 from the government\u2019s planned benefit freeze next year.",

Jon Cunliffe, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, warned of a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-17/boe-s-cunliffe-warns-of-big-fall-in-pound-on-bad-brexit-outcome\">\u201cbig fall\u201d</a> in the pound should Britain fail to agree a deal with Brussels before formally leaving the EU on 29 March. Sterling has dropped by about a cent against the dollar in the past month to stand at $1.30.

The rapid buildup in debt since the last financial crisis has made the world more vulnerable to higher borrowing costs, which could trigger companies and nations defaulting on their debts as the Fed raises rates. Fears over a slowdown in the Chinese economy and the impact over the US-China trade war also had an impact. The FTSE 100, which includes many international companies, has lost 10% since its peak in May \u2013 the definition of a market correction.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Falling food prices fuel inflation slowdown</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"cpi\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;cpi&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>UK inflation dropped further than expected in September, as the falling price of meat and chocolate cut cash-strapped households some slack. The Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index (CPI) dropped to 2.4% last month from 2.7% in August, confounding economists\u2019 expectations for a modest reduction to 2.6%. The reading is likely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates, as it suggests inflation is gradually falling back towards its target of 2% set by the Treasury, without the need for higher borrowing costs.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Trade deficit widens as imports surge</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"trade\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;trade&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened more than expected with an increase in imports in August, outstripping the total value of UK goods sold to foreign buyers. The global goods trade deficit was \u00a311.2bn, having increased from \u00a310.4bn in July, which was worse than the \u00a310.9bn forecast by analysts. Despite a worse than expected month for British trade, the trade deficit for the year to August has narrowed by \u00a313.5bn. The goods deficit narrowed by \u00a35bn, while the UK\u2019s trade in services surplus widened by \u00a38.6bn. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics do not augur well for the health of UK trade after Brexit, with the data showing the EU contributed most to the narrowing of the trade in goods deficit.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Business activity points towards resilient growth</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"pmi\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;pmi&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There were positive readings for the British economy from surveys of business activity, despite a slight drop in economic output for the country\u2019s dominant services sector.

Retailers had a bumper few months, boosted by the warm weather and the World Cup; however, supermarkets recorded a 1.5% drop in food sales in September. Consumers have come under pressure from high levels of inflation since the EU referendum outcome triggered a drop in the value of the pound, pushing up the cost of imports to Britain.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Public finances give Hammond budget boost</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"borrowing\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;borrowing&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Philip Hammond was handed a boost from the public finances ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/budget-2018\">autumn budget</a>, with a smaller than expected deficit in September.

City economists in a Reuters poll had forecast a deficit of about \u00a34.5bn. So far this financial year, the deficit totals \u00a319.9bn, down 35% from April-September 2017 and the smallest total at this stage of the year since 2002.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the accountancy group PwC and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), 2006-2011 Once again, we have passed through a month in which there has been a mix of economic news. On the positive side, GDP rose by 0.7% in the three months to August, compared with the previous month. Wage growth has picked up to over 3% while inflation dropped back to 2.4% in September. Unemployment has fallen further and the official jobless rate remains at its lowest level for 43 years. Even though retail sales dropped back in September, this appears to reflect monthly volatility. Over the past three months there has been healthy growth in the volume of spending in the retail sector. Looking ahead, however, there are some more worrying indicators. The latest CBI industrial trends survey shows that manufacturers are now expecting orders and output to decline over the next few months \u2013 the weakest responses recorded since 2011. Optimism about export prospects is now at its lowest for six years. Investment intentions are now the weakest we have seen since the depths of the financial crisis nearly 10 years ago. At the same time, industrialists appear to be struggling to find the skilled workers they need to fill vacancies. Skilled labour shortages are the highest recorded by the CBI since 1974. Manufacturing industry is a key bellwether of the global economy \u2013 and is also one of the areas of the economy most likely to be affected by Brexit. The CBI industrial survey, which has been running for over 60 years now, has often proved an early warning indicator of more difficult economic times to come. The UK stock market has also had a bad month. Uncertainty about the global economy, rising political risk at home and abroad, plus increased Brexit uncertainty, have hit UK equity prices hard. So despite some positive economic news over the summer, we may well see some harsher economic conditions as we move through the autumn and winter and into 2019. The chancellor has a challenging job trying to lift the spirits of the business community next week. He will need to take some bold and imaginative moves which show he understands current business concerns and uncertainties, many of which are related to Brexit. David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US and member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from 2006 to 2009 Plunging stock markets around the world was the biggest news of the month as investors became spooked over the impact from the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates. The FTSE 100 dropped by more than 470 points, or by around 6.5%, on the month and is down more than 11% since May. My concern is that rising interest rates are going to cause a global slowdown. That is how most recoveries end. UK investor morale has hit its lowest level in at least 23 years, including at the start of the great recession in 2008, according to financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown. Its investor confidence index fell to 53 this month, from 58 in October \u2013 its lowest level since it began in 1993. It has averaged 92 over the last decade, but just 69 over the last 12 months. Brexit is the top issue worrying investors. The CBI industrial trends report this week found that new orders at UK factories fell at the fastest pace in three years in the last quarter. Firms are more pessimistic about business prospects, particularly about their chances of selling goods abroad. Car company CEOs also continue to warn of the harsh consequences of Brexit for their businesses if a suitable Brexit deal isn\u2019t negotiated. In September, retail sales fell 0.8% as weak demand for food hit supermarkets and dragged down spending overall. Inflation dropped further than expected in September. The consumer price index dropped to 2.4% last month from 2.7% in August. Unemployment rose and employment fell slightly on the month. Wage growth remained broadly flat. Real earnings in August 2018, as measured by average weekly earnings including bonuses at constant 2015 prices, were \u00a3492 \u2013 up \u00a31 from two years earlier in August 2016 and down 6% since the start of recession. The times, they are a-changin\u2019 \u2013 but not for the better.

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond is coming under increasing pressure to raise public spending in the budget on Monday to protect the British economy against Brexit, against a backdrop of mixed economic developments over the past month. Ahead of what will probably be the last UK budget in more than 40 years of EU membership, stock markets have plunged in the face of a cocktail of geopolitical risks, raising the spectre of Britain going it alone just as the world economy enters a tougher period. The latest snapshot from the Guardian\u2019s Brexit dashboard does, however, show British workers benefiting from the strongest pay growth in almost a decade, unemployment at the lowest level in 40 years, and inflation dropping by more than expected. Despite handing a reprieve to cash-strapped families, economists have warned that the storm clouds connected to Brexit are gathering for the UK economy. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the interest rate-setting monetary policy committee at the Bank of England, urged the chancellor to take decisive action to maintain business confidence. \u201cDespite some positive economic news over the summer, we may well see some harsher economic conditions as we move through the autumn and winter and into 2019,\u201d he said. To gauge the impact of the EU referendum outcome on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in four cases the outcome was better than expected. In the latest figures, surveys of business activity showed that British firms remained resilient in September, despite a slight growth slowdown for the UK\u2019s dominant services sector. Economists said the readings suggest the UK economy had continued to expand at a rate of about 0.4% in the third quarter, which is the same as the level recorded in the second quarter. However, failure by Theresa May to agree a deal with Brussels before Britain\u2019s formal departure date on 29 March could trigger a sharp drop in the value of the pound and other wide-ranging negative economic consequences, according to analysis published this month by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s tax and spending watchdog. The UK\u2019s trading position with the rest of the world deteriorated in August, according to the latest figures, with the prospects for global trade damaged by US import tariffs on China and the EU, with potential to trigger a broad slowdown in economic growth just as Britain leaves the EU \u2013 its largest trading partner. The latest dashboard points to potential signs of weakness for the months ahead. An abrupt slowdown in consumer spending in September suggests that the resilience built up in the UK economy over the summer \u2013 when warm weather and the World Cup gave Britain a shot in the arm \u2013 has begun to fade. The volume of retail sales dropped by 0.8% in a month, which was twice the fall forecast by economists. The figures may point towards continuing weakness after official growth figures revealed that the British economy ground to a standstill in August. The EY Item Club forecasting group said the economy would struggle to recover in the final months of the year, with Britain on track for the worst year for economic growth in almost a decade as a consequence of Brexit concerns among businesses and consumers. Hammond is under increasing pressure to ditch austerity after May claimed that the Tories would end the deep cuts to public spending at the Conservative party conference. Economists are doubtful, as this would require either stronger economic growth, higher taxes or higher borrowing in the years ahead, with an estimate from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that Hammond needs \u00a319bn to end austerity and boost NHS spending. The chancellor may, however, have little choice but to lift spending should the British economy deteriorate further. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, another former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC, said the conditions were \u201cchanging, but not for the better\u201d. \u201cThis looks like a really good time for [the chancellor] to end the failed austerity that has caused so much unnecessary pain and hardship,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "English winemakers are raising a glass to a bumper harvest on course to be the best in history in terms of both quality and quantity, after a long, hot summer provided unparalleled conditions for viticulture. The wine and spirits trade body said, however, that any celebrations could be short-lived, cut short by rises in duty expected in next week\u2019s budget. Kent-based Chapel Down, the largest English winemaker by volume, said it had more than doubled its grape yield, thanks in part to the addition of new acreage but also to favourable weather. \u201cThis year\u2019s harvest has been exceptional,\u201d the firm\u2019s chief executive, Frazer Thompson, said. \u201cIt is without peer in the history of the industry and gives us a real opportunity to not only sell more still wines next year, but also put sparkling base wines aside for future growth.\u201d Thompson said English winemakers had enjoyed \u201call the right weather and in the right order\u201d, with a long hot summer followed by mild conditions during the harvest season. He said Chapel Down, which harvested 125% more grapes than its previous record year, had been \u201cdelighted with not only the quantity of fruit but also the quality, especially in Kent.\u201d The Wine and Spirits Trade Association (WSTA) said that although the harvest was still not finished for many winemakers, it was on course to break records, with Chapel Down\u2019s bumper crop replicated across the burgeoning English wine industry. \u201cThe knock-on effect of near perfect growing conditions in the UK has led to generous grape bunches and many vineyards are expecting an early harvest,\u201d said the WSTA\u2019s chief executive, Miles Beale. He cautioned though that merriment among vintners could be overshadowed by an expected 3.4% duty rise on wine in line with retail price inflation in the chancellor\u2019s budget next week. The WSTA urged Philip Hammond and the environment secretary, Michael Gove, to ease the tax burden on wine in a letter signed by 14 English winemakers earlier this month. Wine duty has risen by 28% since 2010, adding 48p to a bottle of still wine, according to the WSTA, with the average price of a bottle now at an all-time high of \u00a35.68, more than half of which is made up of tax. \u201cBy freezing duty next week the chancellor has the opportunity to put the brakes on further price rises,\u201d the WSTA said. It pointed to the impact of a freeze in wine and spirit duty in the November budget last year, which it said led to an increase in wine duty income of \u00a339m between February and August 2018, up 2% on the same time last year. Wine importers, bottling plants, distributors, retailers and logistics companies across the UK employ around 170,000 people, according to the WSTA, and in 2017 paid almost \u00a34.7bn in duty to the Treasury, more than it collected from any other type of alcoholic drink. Despite the WSTA\u2019s complaints about the duty burden, the English wine industry has enjoyed huge growth in recent years, with 3.86m bottles released onto to the market in 2017, up 64% on the previous year and nearly three times the 1.34m recorded in 2000. A million vines were planted in both 2016 and 2017 as winemakers sought to capitalise on the growth in the industry, doubling the amount of English countryside devoted to winemaking over the past 10 years. The quality of English wines has also been recognised internationally, with Norfolk\u2019s Winbirri Vineyards named the surprise winner of the world\u2019s best value single-variety still white wine in the prestigious Decanter World Wine awards last year. English sparkling wine has proved particularly successful, thanks to similarities between the geography and topography of parts of southern England and the Champagne region of France.",

      "bodyText": "Gourmet Burger Kitchen is to close 17 of its 85 restaurants with the potential loss of 250 jobs in the latest sign of tough trading conditions on Britain\u2019s high streets. The upmarket burger chain has asked landlords and other creditors to support a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) restructuring plan as it admitted it was struggling in a \u201cchallenging UK casual dining environment\u201d and said its rental payments were too high. Derrian Nadauld, the firm\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cWe are having to take tough but necessary actions to reduce our fixed-cost base and restore long-term profitability.\u201d The chain is owned by South Africa\u2019s Famous Brands, which also owns the Wimpy franchise in the UK. It is the latest in a series of casual dining restaurant groups to close outlets through a CVA as consumer spending slows and the cost of wages and business rates rise. Overexpansion by formulaic groups backed by private equity has also increased competition just as diners have reined in spending. The rival chain Byron closed 20 of its 67 sites through a CVA while Jamie\u2019s Italian, Carluccio\u2019s and Cau, part of the Gaucho group, have all used the process to shut outlets and cut hundreds of jobs this year. Matthew Richards, a director at Grant Thornton, which is advising on the Gourmet Burger Kitchen CVA, said: \u201cThe casual dining trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging, driven by a change in dining behaviour, long-term consumer trends and increased competition. \u201cIt is important to stress that no restaurants will close immediately and employees and suppliers will continue to be paid on time and in full.\u201d The chain said it had already taken significant steps toward restructuring the way the business operated, including reducing head office costs, the refurbishment of 30 restaurants and updating its branding. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 October 2018 because Famous Brands does not own Wimpy and Paul, as an earlier version said.

      "bodyText": "The owner of Patisserie Valerie has fought off a winding-up petition against its principal trading subsidiary as the cake shop and cafe group continues to battle for survival. Separately, Patisserie Holdings, which has more than 200 cafes and nearly 3,000 staff, said it was investigating share bonuses that were cashed in this year by both its chief executive and its finance director. The company\u2019s statement did not suggest that any share options had been wrongly allocated or exercised, only that it was \u201cseeking to understand\u201d why the grant of options relating to 2015 and 2016 had not been \u201cappropriately disclosed and accounted for\u201d. The Aim-listed company called in forensic accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers to trawl through its accounts after saying that \u201cfraudulent activity\u201d was uncovered that left the business close to collapse earlier this month. Chris Marsh, the group\u2019s finance director and company secretary, who joined the company in 2006, has since been arrested and bailed. Hertfordshire police, who declined to name the individual, said a 44-year-old man from St Albans, where Marsh lives, had been arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation. The Serious Fraud Office has confirmed that it has opened a criminal investigation into an individual but has not given further information. The group\u2019s multi-millionaire chairman, Luke Johnson, was forced to use \u00a320m of his own money to keep Patisserie Holdings in business after finding that it was nearly \u00a310m in debt instead of having \u00a328m in the bank, as it had last reported. Directors have said they were unaware until 10 October that Patisserie Holdings\u2019 main trading subsidiary, Stonebeach, faced a winding-up petition from HMRC over a \u00a31m unpaid tax bill. Only Marsh and Patisserie Holdings\u2019 chief executive, Paul May, were on the board of Stonebeach until 11 October, when documents filed at Companies House this week show that Luke Johnson joined. The winding up petition was filed on 14 September but the directors said they were unaware of its existence until earlier this month. The case was due to be heard on 31 October, but on Wednesday morning, Patisserie Holdings told the stock market that the winding-up petition had been dismissed in the high court. In a separate statement, the company said Marsh had been granted 666,666 bonus shares in 2014, 2015 and 2016. May was granted 1m shares in each of those years. Shares granted in the first two years have been exercised and sold this year. The company\u2019s latest annual report gives the correct information relating to share options granted in 2014, but says only 320,000 share options were granted to executives in both 2015 and 2016. Over the period, Marsh made a profit of nearly \u00a32m from the share sales, while May made more than \u00a32.6m.",

Big British lenders approved 37,352 mortgages for house purchases last month, down from 42,581 in August, according to figures from UK Finance, the banking trade body. It was the lowest level since February this year and a 10% fall compared with September 2017. Gross mortgage lending was \u00a33bn lower than August at \u00a321.5bn, the weakest since April this year. The Bank of England raised interest rates in August for only the second time in a decade, from 0.5% to 0.75%. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, said: \u201cThe housing market is struggling for traction in the face of still-limited consumer purchasing power, fragile consumer confidence and wariness over higher interest rates. Brexit uncertainty may also be having some dampening impact on activity.\u201d The housing market has slowed in the two years since the vote to leave the EU, with properties in London a particular weak spot, with falling prices. UK house prices grew at the slowest rate in five years in the year to August, according to figures published earlier this month by the Office for National Statistics. London was the only region where prices fell on an annual basis, down 0.2%. Economists and industry practitioners have warned that the prospects for increased mortgage lending in the coming months are limited by persistent concerns over affordability, as well as the uncertainty over the impact Brexit will have on the economy. UK Finance\u2019s figures for September showed the number of people looking to remortgage properties also fell, to a six-month low of 27,676. Remortgaging had hit its highest level since November 2017 in August, as homeowners rushed to lock in lower interest rates before the rate rise. UK Finance also published figures on British households\u2019 non-mortgage borrowing, which showed annual growth of 4% in consumer credit such as personal loans and credit cards. That represented a second consecutive monthly acceleration after consumer credit growth hit its slowest rate since late 2014 in July.",

      "bodyText": "Barcelona city council has said it will report the \u201cunacceptable\u201d racial abuse of a black woman on a Ryanair flight from the city as a possible hate crime. Delsie Gayle, 77, said she had felt stunned and depressed after a man shouted at her to move seats while they boarded a plane from Barcelona to Stansted last Friday. In the footage shared on social media, the man appeared to call Gayle an \u201cugly black bastard\u201d and shouted: \u201cDon\u2019t speak to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow.\u201d Gayle\u2019s daughter tried to stand up to the man and told him her mother was disabled. The man said he did not care \u201cwhether she\u2019s fucking disabled or not. If I tell her to get out, she gets out\u201d. Ryanair apparently did not remove the man from the flight, but instead moved Gayle from her seat. Essex police said they had identified both parties in the incident and passed the information to Spanish authorities, who were investigating. Barcelona\u2019s deputy mayor, Jaume Asens, said the matter would be reported to the public prosecutor to see whether a hate crime had been committed. \u201cBarcelona is a welcoming and anti-racist city,\u201d Asens wrote on Twitter. \u201cAll support to the victim.\u201d Asens said Ryanair\u2019s response to the behaviour in the video was unacceptable. \u201cBarcelona city hall will report it. We\u2019re looking for the video-maker and witnesses,\u201d he said. A spokesman for the Civil Guard, which polices Spain\u2019s border and airports, said the criminal investigation was a matter for British police because the plane had been bound for the UK. Spain\u2019s Aviation Safety and Security Agency said it was looking into the incident to see whether it had constituted a safety risk. \u201cWe think what happened, and the racist comments made, were terrible,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cBut our responsibility is aircraft safety and we\u2019re looking into whether or not this comes under our responsibility.\u201d Ryanair tweeted on Sunday that it could not comment further because the incident was now a police matter.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Barclays said the bank is \u201c100% prepared\u201d for a hard Brexit, expanding its Irish subsidiary to become its main European hub outside London. Barclays, which employs almost 50,000 staff in the UK, has increased its operations in Dublin by 150-200 jobs to make Ireland its base for continuing to trade within the European Union. \u201cAt Barclays we are well on our way to being prepared for a hard Brexit,\u201d said Jes Staley, speaking to Bloomberg TV as the bank reported third-quarter results on Wednesday. \u201cWe have increased the size of the bank\u2019s subsidiary in Ireland. We have filed all the necessary applications to relicence our branches. We are fully prepared to be 100% operational in case of a hard Brexit.\u201d Staley said that Dublin was a \u201clogical location\u201d for its EU base because the licences and ownership of its banks across the continent could be moved to the existing subsidiary, Bank Ireland. He added that the headcount increase in Dublin would be a combination of new hires and those from the UK business interested in relocating to Ireland. The bank said it has allocated a proportion of its \u00a313.9bn annual expenses budget to run the expanded Irish business but would not give a specific figure for the cost of Brexit to Barclays. Staley, who earlier this year was ordered to hand over more than \u00a31.1m out of his own pocket for attempting to unmask a whistleblower, said that while hard-Brexit contingency plans are ready to be triggered, the bank would like to see the UK government negotiate a deal with Europe. \u201cWe have been prudent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are pretty well positioned for a hard Brexit. However, like everyone else we would like to see a negotiated Brexit that will not harm the economy in the UK.\u201d Without a free trade deal between the UK and EU to preserve mutual market access for financial services, banks will lose their \u201cpassport\u201d that gives them the right to trade securities across Europe from London. Staley\u2019s comments came as the banking group reported pre-tax profits of \u00a31.5bn in the third quarter, down from \u00a31.9bn in the second quarter. However, profits were up on the \u00a31.1bn reported in the third quarter in 2017. Barclays UK made a \u00a3740m pre-tax profit, up from \u00a3656m in the previous quarter and \u00a3661m in the same period last year. However, the banking group reported a slide in pre-tax profits to \u00a33.1bn for the nine months to the end of September. The bank, which reported a \u00a33.4bn profit in the same quarter last year, blamed litigation and conduct charges related to a \u00a31.4bn settlement with the US Department of Justice over mis-selling financial products before 2008 in the run-up to the financial crisis. It also reported a \u00a3400m additional charge for payment protection insurance claims in the first quarter. The banking group said that stripping out one-off charges, pre-tax profits increased by 23% to \u00a35.3bn for the first nine months of the year. \u201cIn spite of macroeconomic uncertainty and particularly concerns over Brexit, which weigh heavily on market sentiment, 2018 is proving to be a year of delivery on our strategy at Barclays,\u201d Staley said. \u201cWe remain focused on generating improved returns and on distributing a greater proportion of excess capital to shareholders over time.\u201d Staley also said that he will soon meet the corporate raider Ed Bramson, who has taken a more than 5% cent stake in Barclays and is pushing for changes, including influence over the appointment of the bank\u2019s next chairman. \u201cI have only met once with Ed Bramson after our first-quarter earnings call,\u201d Staley said. \u201cWe are going to meet with him again in a few weeks. He has not yet articulated to the bank what his strategy is \u2013 we read the papers and engage with shareholders \u2013 but there has been no real exchange between he and us in terms of strategy.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s leading employers\u2019 organisation has urged the government to end Brexit uncertainty after warning that the deadlocked talks have already led to plunging investment, waning business confidence and the sharpest fall in order books in three years. In its latest quarterly health check, the CBI said the impasse in the talks between London and Brussels would bring growth in manufacturing output to a standstill over the coming month. The CBI has been at the forefront of business demands for a speedy resolution to the Brexit negotiations and a deal that ensures future access to the UK\u2019s main export market, the EU. Its industrial trends survey showed that output had held up well over the past three months but was now expected to falter as order books dried up. The CBI said its measure of business optimism had fallen from -3 to -16 in the past three months, the fastest rate of decline since the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum in June 2016. Concerns that political and economic conditions were likely to limit export orders over the next three months were also at their highest since the survey was conducted in July 2016, an indication that firms are worried about future trade barriers. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThis is a sobering set of figures demanding immediate action at home and abroad. \u201cPlanned investment is being scaled back in the face of deepening Brexit uncertainty, so it\u2019s vital that the chancellor incentivises manufacturers to spend in areas that will help them become more productive. Using the upcoming budget to increase the annual investment allowance, alongside a wider review, could help the UK become more competitive with its global peers.\u201d The survey showed that investment intentions for the year ahead have deteriorated sharply in the past three months, with firms expecting to cut back spending on buildings, training and innovation. Capital expenditure on plant and machinery is set to be reduced at the fastest pace since July 2009. The CBI said firms were also worried that a lack of skilled labour would affect their future plans. Concerns that access to skilled labour would limit output over the quarter ahead rose to the highest in more than 40 years. Newton-Smith said: \u201cAside from much-need progress on domestic policy, the government\u2019s number one priority on Brexit must be securing the withdrawal agreement, ushering in a much-needed transition period that will give businesses the breathing space they need. Protecting jobs and people\u2019s livelihoods from a lost generation of investment remains urgent.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Wall Street and European stock markets followed Asian shares lower on Tuesday, as investors around the world took fright at the increasingly fractious global geopolitical outlook. Investors are growing increasingly worried about a cocktail of risks that could act as a significant drag on the world economy. Potential headwinds include the trade dispute between the US and China, rising US interest rates, the fallout from the death of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the budget dispute between the EU and Italy. Oliver Jones, a markets economist at the research firm Capital Economics, said: \u201cWorries about problems in the US, and to some extent in the past few days China, have proved contagious.\u201d The Dow Jones Industrial Average of leading US companies dropped by more than 500 points in early New York trading on Tuesday, as the global sell-off that began earlier this month gathered pace. The Dow later recovered but was still about 250 points, or 1%, down by 1900 BST. European stock markets also fell sharply, with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 sliding more than 90 points to close below 7,000, ending the day at a seven-month low after another jittery trading session. The leading German stock index dropped by more than 2% and the biggest French companies shed almost 1.7% of their value. Despite the selloff in the US and Europe, markets in Asia were mostly in positive territory on Wednesday morning. The FTSE 100 has dropped 7% since the end of September, setting the index of UK blue-chip companies on course for the worst month since May 2012. It is down more than 10% since its May peak, which is the definition of a market correction, with more turbulence predicted as Britain leaves the EU. UK investor morale has hit its lowest level in at least 23 years, according to the financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown. Its investor confidence index has fallen to 53 this month from 58 in September, its lowest level since it began in 1993. It has averaged 92 over the last decade, but only 69 over the last 12 months. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the constant drip-feed of Brexit news has had a negative effect on investor confidence. \u201cInvestors are in grim mood, as time is running out on Brexit negotiations with little progress on show. Sentiment was dented by the financial crisis, but not to the extent we are seeing today,\u201d he said. Stephen Innes, the head of Asia-Pacific trading for the foreign exchange firm Oanda, said stock markets \u201cremain shrouded in a thick blanket of risk\u201d triggered by negative news from around the world. Caterpillar, the US construction equipment company seen as a bellwether for the US economy disappointed investors when it reported third-quarter earnings on Tuesday with a warning that raw material costs had risen since Donald Trump\u2019s introduction of import tariffs on steel. It said tariffs will cost it about $40m (\u00a331m) in the latest quarter, with an impact this year at the lower end of a range between $100m and $200m. To offset rising costs the company said it would increase the prices of the machines and engines it sells around the world by as much as 4% from January. The company\u2019s stock tumbled by about 7%, helping to drag down the Dow Jones index and other industrial companies that have come under pressure from the rising cost of materials and fears over slowing economic growth. Harley-Davidson warned that tit-for-tat tariffs between the US, EU and China would cost the company about $40m and make US-made motorbikes less competitive on the international market. Trump criticised the company earlier this year after it said the imposition of trade tariffs would force it to shift production overseas. European markets suffered after the EU commission rejected a draft budget proposal submitted by the Italian government, in a move designed to force the populist administration in Rome to rein in its spending. Although the move was widely expected, investors are growing increasingly anxious that the standoff between the commission and the third-largest eurozone economy has the potential to drag on for much longer than previously thought.",
