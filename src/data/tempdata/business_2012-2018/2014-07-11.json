      "bodyText": "British drug firm Shire Pharmaceuticals has confirmed it has held talks with US rival AbbVie after the American firm proposed combining the two drug makers in a \u00a330bn ($51.34bn) deal. Amid pressure from shareholders, Shire confirmed that talks had taken place in New York but were at an early stage. In a press release Shire said: \"There can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any firm offer might be made.\" It \"strongly advised\" shareholders not to take any action in relation to AbbVie's proposal. As part of the deal, North Chicago, Illinois-based AbbVie would move its legal address to the UK, a move that would cut its corporate tax rate from 22% to 13%. The difference in tax rates was also one of the driving factors behind US drug fim Pfizer's ultimately unsuccessful $118bn bid for the UK's AstraZeneca and has triggered a political backlash in the US. AbbVie began its pursuit of Shire in May. The latest talks come as some Shire shareholders have been pushing for the company to finalise a deal with US rival. AbbVie made a fourth offer for Shire on 8 July, valuing the Dublin-based company's shares at \u00a351.15 each, or about \u00a330.1bn in total. Shire's shares rose 5.9% to close at \u00a348.70 in London on Friday, valuing the company at \u00a328.7bn. AbbVie's closed at $54.95 (down 0.76%). Shire was founded in Britain and is listed in London but is today managed out of Boston, headquartered in Dublin and generates most of its sales in the United States. Since the raised offer, Shire has been hearing from top shareholders pushing the company to come to the table and work out a deal in letters, telephone calls and meetings with Shire's chairman Susan Kilsby. Richard Gonzalez, chief executive and chairman of AbbVie, was reported on Tuesday to have said he had spoken to key Shire investors and they were \"generally supportive\" of his company's \u00a330bn offer. But AbbVie issued a formal statement on Wednesday in which it rowed back on a boast which appeared to have been made in contravention of Takeover Panel regulations. \"AbbVie confirms that it has not received any written commitments of support and accordingly retracts the statements. It acknowledges that in the absence of written statements of support from shareholders it is not in a position to make any statement of shareholder support which accords with the provisions of Rule 19.3.\" Under the UK takeover rules AbbVie has until 18 July to make a firm offer for Shire or must withdraw its interest for as long as six months. The drawn-out takeover battle comes amid a wave of similar deal in the pharmaceutical industry as it struggles with rising pressure on health-care spending and a patent expirations for best-selling drugs that threaten future revenue growth. Shire's products include treatments and drugs for rare and life-threatening disease like Hunter syndrome or Fabry disease and a medicine for a attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and ulcerative colitis. A deal would broaden AbbVie's products portfolio. Currently more than half the company's sales come from the rheumatoid arthritis injection Humira. AbbVie may face competition from Allergan, maker of Botox which is battling a $53bn hostile bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals. This week David Pyott, Allergan's chairman and chief executive, told the Financial Times that shareholders had been \"fairly clear that if we have a deal that we can do, we should do it soon\". An AbbVie/Shire deal is certain to reopen the heated political debate in the US over \"inversion\" \u2013 the trend for US companies to takeover foreign rivals and move their headquarters to the new country in order to cut tax rates. In May as the AstraZeneca bid imploded 14 US Senators introduced a new bill, the Stop Corporate Inversions Act, which would essentially ban inversions for two years while Congress attempts to rewrite the US tax code in order to stem the trend. Under current law US companies can move their headquarters overseas if foreign shareholders own at least 20% of their stock. The bill would raise that threshold to 50% for two years. The US Treasury has also proposed upping the percentage of foreign ownership needed for a US company to shift its HQ. Introducing the bill in May senator Carl Levin said: \"You've got to stop the bleeding. Any company that seeks to invert from this point on is taking the risk that a bill that is passed would prevent them from benefiting.\" A recent report by the Congressional Research Service identified 47 inversions in the last decade, involving US pharmaceutical, financial services, manufacturing industries, and others moving their headquarters to Canada, Ireland, Switzerland, and other countries with lower corporate tax rates. US pharmacy chain Walgreens is considering an inversion, moving its headquarters to Switzerland, following its planned acquisition of European drug retailer Alliance Boots Holdings. Canada's Valeant has cited tax savings in its proposed takeover of Allergan.",

      "bodyText": "The main City regulators have warned former managers of HBOS that they faced possible fines and being banned from the Square Mile after they broadened their investigation into one of Britain's most infamous bank failures. The Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority said a review of staff conduct before the \u00a347bn of losses that came to light in 2008 would go beyond the top bosses identified in a previous inquiry. Setting out the detailed terms of reference for the investigation, they said officials would look into \"whether the regulators should consider afresh whether any other former members of HBOS's senior management should be subject to investigation with a view to prohibition proceedings\". The much-delayed attempt by regulators to review what was arguably Britain's most reckless bank before the financial crisis has frustrated MPs and the public. Last year the parliamentary commission on banking standards published an official report that was deeply critical of the chairman Lord Stevenson, chief executive Andy Hornby and his predecessor James Crosby, saying their \"toxic\" mistakes had led to the \"colossal failure\" of the bank. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chaired the commission, suggested that further sanctions could be needed, saying: \"Those responsible for bank failures should be held more directly accountable for their actions and face sanction.\" So far the regulator has only fined and banned Peter Cummings, the former head of its commercial property arm which ran up debts of more than \u00a320bn. Cummings fought the regulator, saying that he conducted his business in good faith and never foresaw the credit crunch, but he was fined \u00a3500,000 and banned for life from working in the City. Stevenson, Hornby and Crosby have all faced parliamentary humiliation under questioning by MPs. Crosby was stripped of his knighthood and resigned as a regulator, Hornby handed back some of his income and Stevenson left the City. In the aftermath of the report, the business secretary, Vince Cable, threatened to review their conduct with a view to possibly banning them as company directors. However, they have never faced sanction by regulators and any further action was delayed after the government announced that the Financial Services Authority, which started the inquiry, would close and hand over to its two successors. Crosby, who sold two-thirds of his shares just before the banking crisis hit and the bottom fell out of their value, has continued to receive a pension, expected to be almost \u00a3700,000. Hornby continues to play a part in business life and enjoys a \u00a3240,000 HBOS pension.

    "webTitle": "Burberry - a public company with rather private pay deals", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The adoration of Christopher Bailey has limits, it seems. About 53% of Burberry's shareholders voted against the company's pay report, another embarrassment on the remuneration front for the chairman, Sir John Peace, fresh from a 41% revolt at Standard Chartered where he does the same job. There is a theme here: the refusal to make a case, in advance, for giving executives huge pay packets. Too late in the day, Peace on Friday attempted to explain why Bailey is worth it. The chief creative officer, now doubling up as chief executive, was handed 1m shares, worth about \u00a315m, last summer because there were \"competing job offers for Christopher which were much more than his existing package\". The top end of the fashion industry, he said, is full of such mega-deals \u2013 we just don't see them because most of Burberry's rivals are not public companies. It's an argument, but it breezily ignores the fact that Burberry is a public company and thus is obliged to be up-front on boardroom pay and provide clear justifications. The remuneration report failed that test. The \u00a315m share award (making \u00a320m once a 2010 award is included) was noted in half a sentence at the end as something that happened in Bailey's \"previous role\". Having persuaded him to stay, Burberry then handed Bailey a \u00a37.5m golden hello a few months later when promoting him to chief executive; \u00a322.5m in a single year deserved a full explanation. In similar style, Burberry insists on saying Bailey has a \u00a3440,000 \"allowance\" on top of his \u00a31.1m salary. It's not an allowance \u2013 it's a second, non-pensionable, salary. The verbal gymnastics are silly. Peace says he was \"disappointed\" by the vote and will consult shareholders again. If he had done so properly in the first place, he might have been able to scrape a narrow majority. A few waverers might have been won over if Peace had been able to demonstrate that Bailey is paid in line with peers; merely asserting the fact, when the proxy votes are already cast, looks arrogant. Bailey himself is said to be a model of politeness, so he may be too shy to say so: the board did him no favours by allowing the shareholder revolt to grow. It was obvious there would be a stink. No performance conditions are attached to the \u00a320m freebie shares \u2013 Bailey is just required to stay \"over three, four and five years from the date of grant\" \u2013 and retention bungs always go down badly. Burberry claimed a few weeks ago that shareholders were supportive and that it was only the Guardian making a fuss. Yeah, right. The board won the forward-looking binding vote on pay \u2013 the 53% thumbs-down was on the advisory vote on the remuneration report itself \u2013 so Burberry can dig in its heels in theory. That would be a mistake. Peace should invite Bailey to accept some performance conditions. After that, Peace, with 12 years on the clock as chairman, might ask himself whether it's time to let somebody else have a go. Burberry's shares have performed wonders in that time, but this row could have been avoided. Maybe Bailey is worth the money \u2013 fashion is a specialised gig and former colleagues and rivals agree he is a design genius \u2013 but it is a bad error for the chairman of a FTSE 100 company to take shareholders for granted. Big reaction, small problem? A canary in the eurozone debt-mine? Or just an everyday tale of a local crisis at a family-dominated group with too many cross-shareholdings? On the face of it, the numbers in the Espirito Santo affair in Portugal look too small to indicate deeper problems. Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo (BES), the bank exposed to troubles within a family group of companies, did its best to quell the panic. Portugal's third largest bank put its exposure at \u20ac1.18bn (\u00a3938m) and said it had a more than adequate capital cushion of \u20ac2.1bn at the end of March, a figure that excludes \u20ac1bn subsequently raised via a rights issue. If that level of exposures stands the test of time, or even the next fortnight, the saga may be forgotten quickly. That, of course, assumes BES has no horrors to unveil from its Angolan operation. All the same, the big reaction in markets on Thursday to seemingly small news is intriguing. Why the worry? Two reasons. First, Portugal has just emerged from a three-year bailout programme. Investors assumed that included a get-tough approach to bad debts on the part of regulators. Yet the concerns about Esp\u00edrito Santo Financial Group and Luxembourg-based Esp\u00edrito Santo International, have been allowed to bubble away for months. Where was the urgency? Second, the strong suspicion remains that eurozone banks are still woefully under-capitalised and tethered to their sovereign states. As Gary Jenkins of LNG Capital says: \"European politicians who so famously said that they would break the link between banks and sovereigns have failed to do so.\" The BES troubles may pass, but the real moral of this week's tale is that confidence in the eurozone banking system looks dangerously weak. Wealth warning Cigarettes kill but investing in tobacco companies is good for your long-term wealth. Imperial Tobacco's shares have travelled from 400p to \u00a327.40 since the turn of the century with barely a cough along the way. The financial appeal is obvious. Cash flows are still excellent in the western world, where smoking is in retreat, and the share price can be made to sing if you fund the business with heavy helpings of debt. And in the developing world, where they still love their gaspers, the game is about weaning punters off the counterfeits. Now comes another opportunity for Imperial \u2013 a chance to pick up a few stubs from the planned $56bn (\u00a333bn) Reynolds/Lorillard merger in the US. Competition regulators will insist a few brands are sold because the new combo would have a local market share of about 40%, almost as much as Altria, the Marlboro folk. Imperial has a US market share of 3%, but it's the only obvious buyer and might grab a bargain. Price is everything, of course, yet Imperial's apparent enthusiasm to become a national player in the US looks odd. Yes, the US is a big place but even an overnight 10% share wouldn't alter the fact that Imperial would be up against a virtual duopoly. That rarely offers a comfortable life. Cable in a tangle Given the furore over the under-pricing of Royal Mail at privatisation, it was probably wise for Vince Cable to recruit Paul Myners this week to tell him how to do better next time \u2013 or \"help me assess whether changes are needed to the current system,\" as the official statement had it. But the business secretary's pickle could get worse. The government has been free since mid-April to sell its remaining 30% stake in Royal Mail. For most of time since then, the share price has been above 500p - indeed it was as high as 570p in mid-May. Now it has drifted down to 477p. Having appointed Lord Myners to conduct a review, it would be strange not to wait for his conclusions. So one assumes sales are off the agenda for the time being. But who knows where Royal Mail will be trading when the recommendations arrive. Cable, having sold 60% too cheaply, may also have missed the chance to sell at the top.",

The chief creative officer, now doubling up as chief executive, was handed 1m shares, worth about \u00a315m, last summer because there were \"competing job offers for Christopher which were much more than his existing package\".</p> <p>The top end of the fashion industry, he said, is full of such mega-deals \u2013 we just don't see them because most of Burberry's rivals are not public companies.</p> <p>It's an argument, but it breezily ignores the fact that Burberry is a public company and thus is obliged to be up-front on boardroom pay and provide clear justifications. The remuneration report failed that test. The \u00a315m share award (making \u00a320m once a 2010 award is included) was noted in half a sentence at the end as something that happened in Bailey's \"previous role\". Having persuaded him to stay, Burberry then handed Bailey a \u00a37.5m golden hello a few months later when promoting him to chief executive; \u00a322.5m in a single year deserved a full explanation.</p> <p>In similar style, Burberry insists on saying Bailey has a \u00a3440,000 \"allowance\" on top of his \u00a31.1m salary. It's not an allowance \u2013 it's a second, non-pensionable, salary. The verbal gymnastics are silly.</p> <p>Peace says he was \"disappointed\" by the vote and will consult shareholders again. If he had done so properly in the first place, he might have been able to scrape a narrow majority. A few waverers might have been won over if Peace had been able to demonstrate that Bailey is paid in line with peers; merely asserting the fact, when the proxy votes are already cast, looks arrogant.</p> <p>Bailey himself is said to be a model of politeness, so he may be too shy to say so: the board did him no favours by allowing the shareholder revolt to grow. It was obvious there would be a stink. No performance conditions are attached to the \u00a320m freebie shares \u2013 Bailey is just required to stay \"over three, four and five years from the date of grant\" \u2013 and retention bungs always go down badly. Burberry claimed a few weeks ago that shareholders were supportive and that it was only the Guardian making a fuss. Yeah, right.</p> <p>The board won the forward-looking binding vote on pay \u2013 the 53% thumbs-down was on the advisory vote on the remuneration report itself \u2013 so Burberry can dig in its heels in theory. That would be a mistake. Peace should invite Bailey to accept some performance conditions.</p> <p>After that, Peace, with 12 years on the clock as chairman, might ask himself whether it's time to let somebody else have a go. Burberry's shares have performed wonders in that time, but this row could have been avoided. Maybe Bailey is worth the money \u2013 fashion is a specialised gig and former colleagues and rivals agree he is a design genius \u2013 but it is a bad error for the chairman of a FTSE 100 company to take shareholders for granted.</p> <h2>Big reaction, small problem?</h2> <p>A canary in the eurozone debt-mine? Or just an everyday tale of a local crisis at a family-dominated group with too many cross-shareholdings?</p> <p>On the face of it, the numbers in the Espirito Santo affair in Portugal look too small to indicate deeper problems. Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo (BES), the bank exposed to troubles within a family group of companies, did its best to quell the panic. Portugal's third largest bank put its exposure at \u20ac1.18bn (\u00a3938m) and said it had a more than adequate capital cushion of \u20ac2.1bn at the end of March, a figure that excludes \u20ac1bn subsequently raised via a rights issue.</p> <p>If that level of exposures stands the test of time, or even the next fortnight, the saga may be forgotten quickly. That, of course, assumes BES has no horrors to unveil from its Angolan operation. All the same, the big reaction in markets on Thursday to seemingly small news is intriguing.</p> <p>Why the worry? Two reasons. First, Portugal has just emerged from a three-year bailout programme. Investors assumed that included a get-tough approach to bad debts on the part of regulators. Yet the concerns about Esp\u00edrito Santo Financial Group and Luxembourg-based Esp\u00edrito Santo International, have been allowed to bubble away for months. Where was the urgency?</p> <p>Second, the strong suspicion remains that eurozone banks are still woefully under-capitalised and tethered to their sovereign states. As Gary Jenkins of LNG Capital says: \"European politicians who so famously said that they would break the link between banks and sovereigns have failed to do so.\" The BES troubles may pass, but the real moral of this week's tale is that confidence in the eurozone banking system looks dangerously weak.</p> <h2>Wealth warning<br></h2> <p>Cigarettes kill but investing in tobacco companies is good for your long-term wealth. Imperial Tobacco's shares have travelled from 400p to \u00a327.40 since the turn of the century with barely a cough along the way. The financial appeal is obvious. Cash flows are still excellent in the western world, where smoking is in retreat, and the share price can be made to sing if you fund the business with heavy helpings of debt. And in the developing world, where they still love their gaspers, the game is about weaning punters off the counterfeits.</p> <p>Now comes another opportunity for Imperial \u2013 a chance to pick up a few stubs from the planned $56bn (\u00a333bn) Reynolds/Lorillard merger in the US. Competition regulators will insist a few brands are sold because the new combo would have a local market share of about 40%, almost as much as Altria, the Marlboro folk. Imperial has a US market share of 3%, but it's the only obvious buyer and might grab a bargain.</p> <p>Price is everything, of course, yet Imperial's apparent enthusiasm to become a national player in the US looks odd. Yes, the US is a big place but even an overnight 10% share wouldn't alter the fact that Imperial would be up against a virtual duopoly. That rarely offers a comfortable life.</p> <h2>Cable in a tangle<br></h2> <p>Given the furore over the under-pricing of Royal Mail at privatisation, it was probably wise for Vince Cable to recruit Paul Myners this week to tell him how to do better next time \u2013 or \"help me assess whether changes are needed to the current system,\" as the official statement had it. But the business secretary's pickle could get worse. The government has been free since mid-April to sell its remaining 30% stake in Royal Mail. For most of time since then, the share price has been above 500p - indeed it was as high as 570p in mid-May. Now it has drifted down to 477p. Having appointed Lord Myners to conduct a review, it would be strange not to wait for his conclusions. So one assumes sales are off the agenda for the time being. But who knows where Royal Mail will be trading when the recommendations arrive. Cable, having sold 60% too cheaply, may also have missed the chance to sell at the top.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A slowdown in the construction sector has fanned fears that the UK recovery has lost momentum in recent months. Official figures showed the industry suffered its sharpest slowdown for more than a year during the three months to May, with output falling 0.8% from the previous three months. The more volatile monthly figures showed that construction output dropped 1.1% from April to May as private housebuilding stagnated \u2013 the latest sign that the property market may be coming off the boil. The figures capped off a week of disappointing data including a surprise slump in factory output and an unexpectedly wide trade deficit in May. That raised concerns over the impact a stronger pound is having on exporters after the currency strengthened markedly over the last year. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the latest construction numbers were \"another blow to second quarter growth hopes\". \"Until recently, it had looked highly likely that GDP growth in the second quarter at least matched the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter expansion achieved in the first quarter, but this is now looking increasingly questionable,\" said Archer. Other economists have pointed to business surveys that tell a more upbeat tale with order books, hiring and output rising. The Office for National Statistics said that in annual terms, construction output in May was up 3.5%, the slowest pace of growth for six months. The slowdown came as a 19.4% annual rise in housebuilding was offset by year-on-year falls in output for infrastructure work and private commercial projects. But the latest official numbers contrasted with a poll of businesses published last week that suggested construction activity surged in June. Housebuilding was the main driver as the Markit/CIPS construction PMI rose to a four-month high of 62.6 in June from 60 in May. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit, which compiled the survey, said the latest official numbers should be interpreted with caution. \"The data leave us scratching our heads, as surveys and anecdotal evidence from the sector point to booming business conditions. There's a strong likelihood that either these latest numbers will get revised higher or that June will see a strong rebound,\" he said. \"Even with this disappointing construction number, the official data available so far and the PMI surveys indicate that the UK economy enjoyed another robust economic expansion in the second quarter, at least matching the 0.8% growth seen in the first quarter. Once the volatility in the official data is accounted for, there's also little sign of momentum waning as we move into the second half of the year.\" Construction, which accounts for about 6% of the economy, was hit hard by the recession and still remains around 10% below its pre-crisis peak. Policymakers have warned that despite a pick-up in housebuilding, the supply of homes still lags behind what is needed to meet demand in Britain. That mismatch has resulted in average house prices gaining about 10% over the last year. But there have been signs in recent weeks that property price inflation is starting to moderate. House prices defied City economists' forecasts for another monthly rise and slipped 0.6% in June, according to mortgage lender Halifax. A report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggested tough talk from the Bank of England over the threat of a housing bubble and the tightening of lending rules dampened the housing market last month. Esp\u00edrito Santo Financial markets regained some poise on Friday as fears abated about the potential spread of problems at one of Portugal's biggest banks. The suspension of shares in Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo on Thursday had sparked panic selling on both sides of the Atlantic amid concerns that it would lead to a wider run on the eurozone's debt-ridden banking sector. Some of those losses were recouped on the FTSE 100 yesterday and the main indices in Portugal, Spain and Italy all rebounded. However, analysts warned that some fundamental problems in the single currency bloc remained unresolved. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: \"Events in Portugal are a wake-up call to complacent investors who believed that Europe was starting to address its peripheral banking problems, and while on their own events surrounding Espirito Santo could well be contained, the fact that these problems surrounding the solvency of peripheral banks have come at a time when the recovery in Europe shows signs of stalling is particularly concerning,\" said Hewson. \"Debt-to-GDP ratios are already eye-wateringly high, and this week's stunning capitulation in May industrial production data from Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands has raised fears that the so-called eurozone recovery has become stuck in quicksand, and without growth to erode the debt levels, the money that has flowed into Europe could well come flooding back out.\"",

      "bodyText": "Financial regulators on Friday suspended trading in Cynk, the social networking company with no assets, no revenues and one employee, whose value on the stock market had mysteriously soared to $6bn in a matter of weeks. Fuelling talk of another dotcom bubble, shares in the until now unknown Belize-based tech firm soared as much as 25,000% from the middle of June before being suspended Friday morning, before trading began. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority halted trading in the company, citing an \"extraordinary event.\u201d In a statement, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) statement said the suspension had been made \u201cbecause of concerns regarding the accuracy and adequacy of information in the marketplace, and potentially manipulative transactions in Cynk's common stock.\" The stock\u2019s runaway rise had made the profitless company more valuable than Domino\u2019s Pizza, JetBlue or Spotify \u2013 even as a chorus of critics cited mounting evidence that there was little substance behind Cynk. Valued at 6\u00a2 a share back in June, Cynk finished trading on Thursday valued at $14 and had reached as high as $21. The rise has made a paper billionaire of Marlon Luis Sanchez, the chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, secretary, treasurer and director. Sanchez, a partner in Sanchez Medical Services, a company that \u201cprovides comprehensive medical services to the southern California market\u201d, is also the primary spokesperson for the Medical Tourism Industry counsel in Tijuana, Mexico. Calls to the office of Sanchez Medical Services went unanswered. Cynk\u2019s main business is a website called introbiz.com, which markets itself as somewhere to \u201cbuy and sell the ability to socially connect to individuals such as celebrities, business owners, and talented IT professionals\u201d. The front page features a host of stars, including Angelina Jolie, Channing Tatum, Johnny Depp, Benedict Cumberbatch and Peter Dinklage, although there is no evidence the stars have any ties to the business. There seems to be very little activity on the site. According to a regulatory filing made last November, Cynk has yet to officially launch, and plans to introduce a new model for social networks \"that we believe will require some acceptance\". The plan seems to involve being paid for making meetings happen. \u201cCynk Technology Corp believes its planned social network may disrupt an inefficient model of meeting people that is currently based on vague notions of social capital by making it clear \u2018I want to meet this person, and I will make it worth your while\u2019,\u201d the company said in its filing with the SEC. \u201cWe believe that people will pay for introductions that are meaningful, since it can save or create significant value to someone's life such as to find the right executive, nanny, software developer \u2013 or even the right squash player. Instead of paying for a lunch that neither party wants to eat, parties can get down to business knowing that their time has been valued,\u201d the company said. Some companies, Cynk concedes, may be unhappy with their employees taking money for paid introductions. In those cases, money could be given to a charity. Cynk is also likely to \u201cfly under the radar\u201d for some time, according to the filing. Cynk concedes that there are plenty of other social networks out there, not least LinkedIn which has emerged as the major business-focussed social network. \u201cHowever, Cynk Technology Corp believes a social network that generates revenue is a compelling reason to get people to join,\u201d the company said. So far Cynk and its one employee have not made any money, at least not from their primary business. Sanchez was awarded 210m shares \u201cfor acceptance of position and responsibilities\u201d on 17 April 2013. The shares were valued at $.0068 each, or $1,428,000 (\u00a3834,000) at the time. Assuming he still holds those shares, and that he would have been allowed to sell them and able to find a buyer, on Thursday they were worth an astounding $2.9bn (\u00a31.69bn). Cynk\u2019s extraordinary rise started about three weeks ago with a barrage of Twitter accounts tweeting about a massive surge in the stock\u2019s price. The volatile penny-stock market is notorious for sudden share price rises and falls that leave the owners who bought in high holding the bag and facing large losses. Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, a global brokerage company based in New York, said: \u201cAfter the 1990s tech bubble, the 2000s housing bubble, and the financial crisis, you\u2019d think that investors would be keenly aware of excessive risk taking. Turns out you\u2019d be wrong, at least in several areas.\u201d",

The plan seems to involve being paid for making meetings happen.</p> <p>\u201cCynk Technology Corp believes its planned social network may disrupt an inefficient model of meeting people that is currently based on vague notions of social capital by making it clear \u2018I want to meet this person, and I will make it worth your while\u2019,\u201d the company said in its filing with the SEC.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that people will pay for introductions that are meaningful, since it can save or create significant value to someone's life such as to find the right executive, nanny, software developer \u2013 or even the right squash player. Instead of paying for a lunch that neither party wants to eat, parties can get down to business knowing that their time has been valued,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>Some companies, Cynk concedes, may be unhappy with their employees taking money for paid introductions. In those cases, money could be given to a charity. Cynk is also likely to \u201cfly under the radar\u201d for some time, according to the filing. Cynk concedes that there are plenty of other social networks out there, not least LinkedIn which has emerged as the major business-focussed social network.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, Cynk Technology Corp believes a social network that generates revenue is a compelling reason to get people to join,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>So far Cynk and its one employee have not made any money, at least not from their primary business. Sanchez was awarded 210m shares \u201cfor acceptance of position and responsibilities\u201d on 17 April 2013. The shares were valued at $.0068 each, or $1,428,000 (\u00a3834,000) at the time. Assuming he still holds those shares, and that he would have been allowed to sell them and able to find a buyer, on Thursday they were worth an astounding $2.9bn (\u00a31.69bn).</p> <p>Cynk\u2019s extraordinary rise started about three weeks ago with a barrage of Twitter accounts tweeting about a massive surge in the stock\u2019s price. The volatile penny-stock market is notorious for sudden share price rises and falls that leave the owners who bought in high holding the bag and facing large losses.</p> <p>Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, a global brokerage company based in New York, said: \u201cAfter the 1990s tech bubble, the 2000s housing bubble, and the financial crisis, you\u2019d think that investors would be keenly aware of excessive risk taking. Turns out you\u2019d be wrong, at least in several areas.\u201d</p>",

Here is a round-up of reactions I have seen so far<br></p> <p><b>Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight,</b> thinks the outlook for construction remains encouraging, although today's \"disappointing\" result will weigh on second quarter GDP figures.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While May\u2019s construction output data are very disappointing and there has clearly been a recent loss of momentum in the sector, there is hope for the future as latest survey evidence is very healthy overall. Specifically, the purchasing managers\u2019 survey indicates that construction output rose at the fastest rate for four months in June and for a 14<sup>th</sup> consecutive month...<br></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What is particularly encouraging is that the purchasing managers survey indicates that the strength in activity is widespread across sectors. Housebuilding activity is leading the way with activity picking up markedly in June to almost match January\u2019s 10-year high. Meanwhile, commercial activity was at its second highest level (after January) since August 2007. Commercial activity is also relatively elevated despite easing back to a nine-month low in June; this was reported to be partly due to the ending of some work related to repairing February\u2019s flood damage.. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prospects still look largely decent across most sectors. Extended improved economic activity and increased business confidence should underpin commercial construction activity and civil engineering.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Chris Williamson at financial data provider Markit </b> thinks the numbers will breed caution on interest rates. <i>It is worth pointing out that Markit, a financial data provider, is a competitor of the ONS.</i><br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The construction industry moved into reverse in May, according to official data. The weakness of these data alongside disappointing manufacturing output data for May suggest that policymakers will be encouraged to err on the side of caution about hiking interest rates too early in what looks to be a still-fragile recovery... </p> <p>Even with this disappointing construction number, the official data available so far and the PMI surveys indicate that the UK economy enjoyed another robust economic expansion in the second quarter, at least matching the 0.8% growth seen in the first quarter. Once the volatility in the official data is accounted for, there\u2019s also little sign of momentum waning as we move into the second half of the year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-07-11T09:35:35.043Z\">at 10.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53bfa5f5e4b0fc0143df5b2b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-11T08:59:59.756Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Bank of England has warned British banks that they may need to set aside more capital under new global rules to prevent a rerun of the financial crisis.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2014/099.aspx\">consultation paper launched today</a> the Bank said lenders may need to set aside additional funds on top of the 3% of capital currently required. </p> <p>Here are the details from Reuters.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \"There may be a case to introduce a supplementary leverage ratio component to a subset of firms (e.g. ring-fenced banks and/or systemically important institutions) whose failure would be most destabilising for the financial system,\" the BoE said in a consultation paper.</p> <p>Such a supplement would effectively cover the bulk of Britain's banks.

But yesterday's panic sell-off is an unpleasant reminder for European leaders about how much work needs to do to repair the financial system.</p> <p>Here are some of the most interesting comments I've seen this morning.<br></p> <p><b>Gary Jenkins at LNG Capital</b> thinks a major overhaul of the financial system is still required.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It shows what a crazy financial system we have created when one small financial institution can cause such shockwaves around the world. It also demonstrates that European politicians who so famously said that they would break the link between banks and sovereigns have singularly failed to do so. <br></p> <p>That is not a surprise because under our current financial system it is impossible to break that link. What we need is not minor tinkering with the regulations but a complete overhaul of the banking system. <br></p> <p>It is also a good reminder that whilst you can analyse a corporate with some element of certainty as looking at the balance sheet, cash flow statement, profit and loss gives you some idea of the financial strength of the company it is almost impossible to analyse a modern bank with the same degree of confidence. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><b>Nicholas Spiro at Spiro Sovereign Strategy</b> looks at the good, the bad and the ugly.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> <b>The good: </b>This is not the eurozone financial crisis flaring up again. Just a cursory glance at the government bond yields of Spain and Italy - the most accurate gauge of sentiment towards the bloc's periphery - shows that today's events are a world apart from the panic that engulfed Europe's single currency area in 2011 and 2012. Even after a 40 basis point rise this week, Portugal's 5-year bond yield is still just a tad higher than its US equivalent. Spanish and Italian 10-year yields remain under 3% and are only slightly above their UK equivalent...<br></p> <p><b>The bad: </b>It's not Esp\u00edrito Santo that's the problem. It's the bleak fundamentals of the eurozone periphery which have become worryingly detached from the region's buoyant financial markets. The rally in peripheral debt has looked overdone for quite some time. The tug-of-war between central bank largesse and economic, financial and political vulnerabilities in the eurozone has been dominated by the latter, fuelling an increasingly indiscriminate \"grab for yield\". The question is whether Esp\u00edrito Santo jolts investors out of their complacency about the risks in the eurozone.</p> <p><b>The ugly: </b>Esp\u00edrito Santo's problems are significant only in the sense that they're a symptom of deeper structural problems in the eurozone... Europe's banking union is an extremely weak construct mainly because it lacks a credible backstop. The financial fragmentation of the eurozone persists given the lack of support for a proper political and economic union. If Esp\u00edrito Santo turns out to be the trigger for a sharp and sustained deterioration in sentiment towards the eurozone - which at this stage appears very unlikely - these governance problems will come to the fore. <b> <br></b> </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53bf93dfe4b03d295c8d06c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-11T07:54:22.371Z\">8.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Vince Cable has taken to the airwaves this morning to defend the government's handling of the sale of Royal Mail, after a committee of MPs concluded that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/11/royal-mail-sale-lost-1bn-says-select-committee\"> the taxpayer had lost out on \u00a31bn</a>.</p> <p>Speaking on <b>BBC Radio 4 Today's programme </b>the business secretary said the committee had the benefit of hindsight.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We sold at a price that was regarded as the best that could be achieved in the context in which we sold it. <br></p> <p>The point we have stressed, and I've stressed over and again, that the price of shares is very, very volatile - these things go up and down and we've seen in the last few weeks the price of Royal Mail shares actually falling like a stone. </p> </blockquote> <p><b>Adrian Bailey, the chair of the Business Select Committee</b>, said the government had been badly advised.

The FTSE 100 is flat; Portugal is in recovery, while leading indices in Spain, France and Germany have barely advanced on market opening. Today's drama came from the corporate world, where trenchcoat maker Burberry suffered one of the FTSE's largest-ever corporate revolts, with 52% investors declining to back its pay report in what the Institute of Directors described as a warning shot. UK construction data fell in May, raising expectations that interest rates will remain on hold. And we found out that UK government spending on science, engineering and technology fell in 2012, contining its downward trajectory since 2009. That's all for today. Thank you for following and all your comments. Portugal's share index has risen 1.42%, meaning it has not made up yesterday's loss of 4.2%. Shares in the troubled Espirito Santo International group, which includes the bank, as well as the hotel and healthcare businesses have been all over the place and by lunchtime were up 0.8% - after a dramatic fall of 17% yesterday. In another bad sign, Portugal's prime minister told investors to stay calm. It is important that Portuguese and foreign investors... remain calm about the bank and our financial and banking system. \ufeff The government may have cut spending across most of the public sector, but science and research was protected - right? As chancellor George Osborne said on 25 April 2014 A key part of our economic plan is our long term plan for science Not so fast. The Office for National Statistics reported today that UK government spending on science, engineering and technology has fallen since 2009. In 2012, \u00a31o bn was spent on Science, Engineering and Technology by the government - a 1% decrease compared with 2011, continuing the downward trend in SET expenditure since 2009, according to the ONS. Between 2001 and 2012, defence expenditure on SET decreased by \u00a31.2 bn in constant prices. This was offset by an increase in Research Councils\u2019 expenditure on SET of almost \u00a31.0 bn in the same period. The Institute of Directors has described today's revolt at the Burberry AGM as a warning shot to the company, who must \"urgently engage with shareholders\". Dr Roger Barker, Director of Corporate Governance at the Institute of Directors [Burberry shareholders] are clearly not convinced that executive pay at the company has been transparently linked to tough performance targets. The onus in now on the board to urgently engage with shareholders to convince them they are responding to their understandable concerns. Investors are generally happy to approve significant pay awards for high-achieving chief executives, but this must be based on proven performance. As undoubtedly successful as Christopher Bailey has been as the creative force behind Burberry\u2019s recent success, he is unproven as a CEO. And yet, his pay will put him amongst the highest paid FTSE chiefs. This is the first year that investors have had a binding vote on future pay policy, in addition to the advisory vote on this year\u2019s actual pay. In this case they have chosen to express displeasure using the advisory vote. However, if the board does not react in a constructive way to investor concerns, there is a real risk that shareholders will feel compelled to use their new binding powers at next year\u2019s annual general meeting. Here is the Guardian's fully story on Burberry Burberry shareholders revolt over Christopher Bailey's pay package Sir John Peace, Burberry's chairman, is also chairman of Standard Chartered, which had its own big pay rebellion at its AGM in May. Some investors are already uneasy about Peace chairing two FTSE 100 companies (he chairs Experian as well but is standing down next week). It's unlikely the debacle at Burberry will endear him to shareholders. Burberry's chairman, Sir John Peace, has got some work to do to smooth things over with shareholders after the vote against the company's pay policy. Even when companies suffer a smaller but sizable rebellion, say 20% or more, investors expect them to come back and make changes. It's highly unlikely that after a defeat, albeit non-binding, shareholders will allow the pay deal to stay intact. Our correspondent Zoe Wood's report, hitting your screen soon, suggests Peace knows this isn't the end of it. Here's the key bit: Speaking afterwards Burberry chairman Sir John Peace said the vote against was \"very disappointing\". \"What we have to do is reflect on that and talk to shareholders.\" Kathryn Hopkins at the Times reports that Burberry is attempting to smooth over the revolt. Sir John Peace has been trying to play down the fact that the remuneration report was voted down by 52 per cent of shareholders, stressing that 99 per cent voted for Christopher Bailey's re-election. Christopher Bailey said he didn't hold Burberry to ransom over his pay. He wouldn't confirm that one of the offers he had from other companies was from Louis Vuitton. Burberry shareholders have shown their anger at the \u00a320m pay deal for Christopher Bailey, with some 52% voting against the remuneration report, which includes Bailey's share offer. So how does the Burberry revolt compare with other shareholder rebellions? Insurer Aviva suffered a 60% vote against its pay (including abstentions) in 2012 to protest a \u00a32.2m golden hello for its incoming head of UK operations. In 2013, nearly 40% of investors failed to support a $4m (\u00a32.5m) share award for the chief executive of mining company Randgold Resources. And in 2012, nearly one third of shareholders declined to back Barclay's pay policy, including a \u00a317m deal for its controversial chairman Bob Diamond. And there are plenty more.... further reading here. The vote on Burberry's remuneration, covering Christopher Bailey's share award, appears to be non-binding. Back to Burberry... and we could see a big revolt on Bailey's pay. To be confirmed. And the winner of the World Cup is.... the bookies. William Hill has just revealed that it took more than \u00a3200m in bets during the World Cup, more than double what the bookmaker generated during the previous tournament in 2010. England's group game with Uruguay last month was the biggest match for William Hill, with more than \u00a35.5 million pounds wagered. Unfortunately, most gamblers backed England to win. The national team lost 2-1 before an ignominious exit from the tournament. Here is more from Reuters: Bookmakers had seen the World Cup as an opportunity to build market share ahead of new taxes due to be introduced over the next year that will cost the industry around \u00a3400m. Television viewers have been bombarded by adverts from betting companies in breaks during matches. William Hill did not give any indication of how profitable the World Cup had been, saving that detail for its next results statement due on Aug. 1. And in an interesting detail Bookies said on Wednesday four gamblers were counting their winnings after putting money on Germany to beat Brazil by the outlandish 7-1 scoreline in the semi-final... Back to the Burberry AGM. Sir John Peace has said Christopher Bailey was very nervous about speaking before shareholders. Plenty of business leaders and pop stars have been exposed for using alleged tax-avoidance schemes. Now a government adviser charged with ensuring taxpayers get value for money from public investments has been caught up in the controversial schemes, according to City AM. The paper reports that Anthony Odgers, deputy chief executive of the Shareholder Executive, a part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), used alleged avoidance schemes in the past. From City AM's story: Odgers was a member of the Ingenious Media investment portfolio when he was appointed by ministers in 2010. He has since left the controversial scheme. HMRC is pursuing all 1,300 members of the investment plan, past and present, for unpaid tax bills that could run to millions of pounds \u2013 demanding the cash up front even when cases are being taken to tribunal. The clawback has been heavily criticised, with City MP Mark Field calling it \u201cwholly wrong\u201d. Other investors include Dame Clara Furse of the Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee, and Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica. A BIS spokesperson said last night: \u201cAnthony Odgers is no longer a partner. His investment pre-dated him joining government in 2010 from Deutsche Bank and was fully disclosed to the tax authorities from the outset.\u201dAs deputy chief exec Odgers is tasked with providing \u201chigh level strategic direction\u201d to the Shareholder Executive. And the Burberry AGM is underway. Here are some of the opening highlights via Twitter. And one shareholder agrees The word on Twitter is that troubled Portuguese bank Espirito Santo will shortly resume trading. Shareholders are gathering in London for Burberry' annual general meeting, due to kick off shortly. The FTSE100 company has raised shareholders' ire with the \u00a320m pay package for chief executive Christopher Bailey. As the Guardian revealed in May, Bailey has been handed a golden hello in shares worth up to \u00a37.6m and an annual pay package worth up to \u00a38.1m a year, including a \u00a3440,000 cash allowance to cover clothing and other items. This has proved to be as popular as a pair of crimplene slacks and a kipper tie at London fashion week. Investor groups Pirc and the Investment Management Association (IMA) have flagged their concerns, with proxy voting firm Manifest giving the company's pay policy and report a \"D\". The Guardian's retail correspondent Zoe Wood is in place and we will be following the action as it unfolds... Italian bond yields, a crucial measure of investor confidence in a country, have fallen to record lows. The Italian treasury has sold \u20ac7.5bn of bonds, the top of its target range, after selling 3-yr, 7-yr and 15-yr bonds. Portugal's banks may be in a class of their own. Economists were surprised by official data showing a 1.1% fall in construction output in May. Here is a round-up of reactions I have seen so far Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight, thinks the outlook for construction remains encouraging, although today's \"disappointing\" result will weigh on second quarter GDP figures. While May\u2019s construction output data are very disappointing and there has clearly been a recent loss of momentum in the sector, there is hope for the future as latest survey evidence is very healthy overall. Specifically, the purchasing managers\u2019 survey indicates that construction output rose at the fastest rate for four months in June and for a 14th consecutive month... What is particularly encouraging is that the purchasing managers survey indicates that the strength in activity is widespread across sectors. Housebuilding activity is leading the way with activity picking up markedly in June to almost match January\u2019s 10-year high. Meanwhile, commercial activity was at its second highest level (after January) since August 2007. Commercial activity is also relatively elevated despite easing back to a nine-month low in June; this was reported to be partly due to the ending of some work related to repairing February\u2019s flood damage.. The prospects still look largely decent across most sectors. Extended improved economic activity and increased business confidence should underpin commercial construction activity and civil engineering. Chris Williamson at financial data provider Markit thinks the numbers will breed caution on interest rates. It is worth pointing out that Markit, a financial data provider, is a competitor of the ONS. The construction industry moved into reverse in May, according to official data. The weakness of these data alongside disappointing manufacturing output data for May suggest that policymakers will be encouraged to err on the side of caution about hiking interest rates too early in what looks to be a still-fragile recovery... Even with this disappointing construction number, the official data available so far and the PMI surveys indicate that the UK economy enjoyed another robust economic expansion in the second quarter, at least matching the 0.8% growth seen in the first quarter. Once the volatility in the official data is accounted for, there\u2019s also little sign of momentum waning as we move into the second half of the year. The Bank of England has warned British banks that they may need to set aside more capital under new global rules to prevent a rerun of the financial crisis. In a consultation paper launched today the Bank said lenders may need to set aside additional funds on top of the 3% of capital currently required. Here are the details from Reuters. \"There may be a case to introduce a supplementary leverage ratio component to a subset of firms (e.g. ring-fenced banks and/or systemically important institutions) whose failure would be most destabilising for the financial system,\" the BoE said in a consultation paper. Such a supplement would effectively cover the bulk of Britain's banks. British lawmakers want a leverage ratio of 4 % or above, higher than the proposed global rule for 3 %, saying tougher measures are needed to ensure taxpayers are not asked to bail out banks as they were in the financial crisis.British banks have been required to meet the 3 % target by Jan. 1, 2014, forcing some to raise more capital. BoE Governor Mark Carney has previously said that 3 percent might not be high enough.The U.S. Federal Reserve has insisted on a leverage ratio of 5 percent and above for U.S. banks. The outcome of the BoE review will be published in November. Building sites were less busy in May, raising concerns that this important sector of the UK economy, which has helped drive forward the recovery, is stalling. The ONS reported a 1.1% fall in May on the previous month, driven mainly by a fall in private commercial work down 3.6%, and repair &amp; maintenance, down 1.1%. But there was a chink of good news as public housing continued to grow. The ONS measure of new housing output, which includes both public and private housing, increased for the third consecutive month, grew by 1.1% in May. The ONS thinks that developers are responding to the shortage of housing by building more homes. The recent increase in housing construction output is likely to reflect recent changes in house prices, which have given developers an incentive to supply more new homes. Breaking news: UK construction output fell 1.1% in May compared to the previous month, the biggest fall since February according to data just released by the Office for National Statistics. Output was up 3.5% in May 2014 on the previous year. A few recent headlines, courtesy of Zerohedge, which has compiled a handy list of upbeat statements from European leaders about Portugal. Here is a flavour: May 4 IMF'S LAGARDE: PORTUGAL IN `STRONG POSITION' TO DEEPEN REFORMS PORTUGAL BAILOUT EXIT IS IMPRESSIVE, GERMANY'S SCHAEUBLE SAYS April 23: PORTUGAL IS NOW ABLE TO FINANCE ITSELF IN THE MARKET: COELHO Complacency? What complacency. Is the Eurozone crisis back? We are far away from panic levels of 2011-12, when markets pushed southern European bonds to eye-watering levels and governments wobbled. But yesterday's panic sell-off is an unpleasant reminder for European leaders about how much work needs to do to repair the financial system. Here are some of the most interesting comments I've seen this morning. Gary Jenkins at LNG Capital thinks a major overhaul of the financial system is still required. It shows what a crazy financial system we have created when one small financial institution can cause such shockwaves around the world. It also demonstrates that European politicians who so famously said that they would break the link between banks and sovereigns have singularly failed to do so. That is not a surprise because under our current financial system it is impossible to break that link. What we need is not minor tinkering with the regulations but a complete overhaul of the banking system. It is also a good reminder that whilst you can analyse a corporate with some element of certainty as looking at the balance sheet, cash flow statement, profit and loss gives you some idea of the financial strength of the company it is almost impossible to analyse a modern bank with the same degree of confidence. Nicholas Spiro at Spiro Sovereign Strategy looks at the good, the bad and the ugly. The good: This is not the eurozone financial crisis flaring up again. Just a cursory glance at the government bond yields of Spain and Italy - the most accurate gauge of sentiment towards the bloc's periphery - shows that today's events are a world apart from the panic that engulfed Europe's single currency area in 2011 and 2012. Even after a 40 basis point rise this week, Portugal's 5-year bond yield is still just a tad higher than its US equivalent. Spanish and Italian 10-year yields remain under 3% and are only slightly above their UK equivalent... The bad: It's not Esp\u00edrito Santo that's the problem. It's the bleak fundamentals of the eurozone periphery which have become worryingly detached from the region's buoyant financial markets. The rally in peripheral debt has looked overdone for quite some time. The tug-of-war between central bank largesse and economic, financial and political vulnerabilities in the eurozone has been dominated by the latter, fuelling an increasingly indiscriminate \"grab for yield\". The question is whether Esp\u00edrito Santo jolts investors out of their complacency about the risks in the eurozone. The ugly: Esp\u00edrito Santo's problems are significant only in the sense that they're a symptom of deeper structural problems in the eurozone... Europe's banking union is an extremely weak construct mainly because it lacks a credible backstop. The financial fragmentation of the eurozone persists given the lack of support for a proper political and economic union. If Esp\u00edrito Santo turns out to be the trigger for a sharp and sustained deterioration in sentiment towards the eurozone - which at this stage appears very unlikely - these governance problems will come to the fore. Vince Cable has taken to the airwaves this morning to defend the government's handling of the sale of Royal Mail, after a committee of MPs concluded that the taxpayer had lost out on \u00a31bn. Speaking on BBC Radio 4 Today's programme the business secretary said the committee had the benefit of hindsight. We sold at a price that was regarded as the best that could be achieved in the context in which we sold it. The point we have stressed, and I've stressed over and again, that the price of shares is very, very volatile - these things go up and down and we've seen in the last few weeks the price of Royal Mail shares actually falling like a stone. Adrian Bailey, the chair of the Business Select Committee, said the government had been badly advised. The government had taken advice from firms, who were also preferred investors, an arrangement defended by the companies because \"Chinese walls\" separate their different arms. Mr Bailey was not impressed. It's not uncommon but that doesn't mean to say that it's right. It's very important that the Government, above all, when it does sell off a public asset does so through a process which quite clearly demonstrates that nobody advising has a conflict of interest. But ultimately the committee pointed the finger at the government. Ultimately the blame lies with the Government, the buck stops with the Government, but it's quite clear they were very badly advised. Quotes from the PA The Portuguese bank at the centre of the sell-off storm has issued a statement saying that it has enough capital to meet its regulatory requirements. Issued late last night after its shares were suspended from Portugal's stock exchange, Banco Espirito Santo said it had \u20ac2.1bn over and above regulatory requirements on 31 March. As Reuters points out, since then the bank has raised just over \u20ac1bn in a share sale that saw the Espirito Santo family lose control of the bank and prompted its patriarch, Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado, to step down as the bank's chief. The bank said: BES Executive Committee believes that the potential losses resulting from the exposure to Esp\u00edrito Santo Group do not compromise the compliance with the regulatory capital requirements. BES shares were suspended on Thursday after the bank revealed earlier in the week \"material difficulties\" at its largest shareholder, Esp\u00edrito Santo International (ESI). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. European markets have rallied after Thursday's sell-off, but investors are likely to remain wary amid renewed fears about the eurozone economy. The FTSE 100 has risen 0.3%, while France's CAC40 is up 0.2%. Markets in southern Europe, hardest hit by yesterday's sell-off, have also risen. Spain's IBEX is up 0.2%, Italy's FTSE MIB 0.3%. In Portugal - the scene of the drama - the PSI20 is flat - perhaps the best to be expected after Thursday's 4.2% fall. In Asia, stocks have had a mixed day. Shares in South Korea and Japan have fallen, but the markets in Hong Kong and Australia were up. And as traders return to the fray amid the resugence of eurozone banking troubles, hard questions are being asked about investors' short memories. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets thinks that the sell-off is a wake-up call for \u201ccomplacent\u201d investors who have been lulled into a false sense of security. None of the underlying problems that served to create the [eurozone] crisis have been dealt with, namely the sovereign debt feedback loop between banks and the governments they fund. The crisis in Portugal is a direct consequence of this failure, along with an almost shocking complacency on the part of investors who have driven bond yields in countries like Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy to, in some cases, record lows. In fact at one point this year Spanish yields were lower than US 10 year bond yields, implying that Spain was considered potentially more creditworthy than the US, This incessant search for yield has driven investors into assets that in normal circumstances they wouldn\u2019t have touched with a barge pole, this year\u2019s successful auction of 5 year Greek bonds, two years after defaulting on its debt, is just such a case in point, and going to show what short memories investors have. Also in our sights is the Burberry annual general meeting, where shareholders are expected to protest against a \u00a320m pay package for new and untested chief executive Christopher Bailey. And we are expecting a batch of data from the Office for National Statistics: construction output and quarterly national accounts, among other statistical treats.",

      "bodyText": "In the vacant parking lot of an estate agency in downtown Austin, Texas, a British man in a white flannel shirt is setting out a row of paper plates along the top of a brick wall. Each plate is piled high with Korean-Mexican fusion food that he has bought from Chi'Lantro, one of hundreds of food trucks that dot the city's side streets and laybys. As the heat of the Texan evening subsides from unbearable to merely stifling, a young woman in towering heels strolls past with a piglet on a leash. Nobody bats an eyelid. After all, she's adhering to the instruction plastered on bumper stickers everywhere to \"Keep Austin Weird\". \"Right, tuck in,\" the British man tells the small group of people with him. He takes a forkful of kimchi fries: a plate of chips slathered in grilled onions, Monterey Jack cheese, Korean barbecue meat, Sriracha dressing, a secret \"magic sauce\", sesame seeds and caramelised kimchi (fermented cabbage). \"You don't get it at first,\" he says, \"but then the heat builds on you. These are really good.\" \"It's a moreish combination,\" his friend adds. \"It ticks all the boxes in terms of flavour.\" They move down the wall, repeating the ritual with the Seoul burrito, the Korean burger and the bulgogi taco. These are not hungry tourists exploring Austin's culinary underbelly. The Brit in the flannel shirt is Steve Rowe, the man who runs Marks &amp; Spencer's food division; he is more or less the man who decides what middle England eats. Rowe and his three colleagues \u2013 a chef, a buyer and the chain's director of product direction and innovation \u2013 are on a trend-hunting trip to find products that they can adapt and sell, and they've invited me to join them. The retailer's food may end up in the fridges of Tunbridge Wells, but its journey starts in places such as this, the car park of Metro Realty. Austin is home to 1,000 food trucks. \"Our role is to pick up on the food trends that people see subliminally,\" Rowe explains in his London accent. \"The British public travels more than ever. What we want to be is one step ahead of them.\" Rowe should know what customers want: he has worked at M&amp;S for 25 years, and his father, Joe, also ran the chain's food division, making them the only father-son team outside of the founding families to have held the same board position; his mother, aunt, maternal grandmother and wife also worked there. Between them, the extended Rowes have clocked up more than 100 years' service. Young Rowe was surrounded by M&amp;S food at home. He recalls eating \"steak after steak after steak\" when his father was experimenting with new packaging techniques in the 1980s. No family restaurant meal could start before a \"forensic discussion about the cut of meat\" had taken place. His father, now 67, still offers advice. When Rowe told him he'd got the food job in 2012, his dad congratulated him before telling him the store was cutting its calves' livers wrong. While eating from roadside shacks might strike some people as an extreme form of market research for one of Britain's more buttoned-up institutions, M&amp;S is playing into a growing trend. \"Food today is all about exploration and innovation,\" says Martin Raymond, co-founder of research body The Future Laboratory. With household budgets under pressure, Brits are spending more on eating in and less on going out. In other words, if a supermarket can sate the public's desire for exotic food they can eat at home, it has cracked a lucrative nut. M&amp;S has some form here: it was the first retailer to sell grapefruits to UK households in the 1930s, and introduced the chicken kiev to the UK in 1979; more recently, a trip to Chicago a few years ago resulted in the \"posh dog\", a smoky, hot dog-style sausage. Nearly a million units were sold last year. Outside a Cajun food truck on the University of Texas campus half an hour later, Rowe is perusing the menu. \"Can I taste your gumbo?\" he asks the shack owner. \"I want to try the alligator, but we might have a sourcing issue.\" Would M&amp;S shoppers really throw crawfish boil into their basket along with their bread, milk and bananas? Absolutely, he claims. About 20% of the store's 6,000-plus products are new every year. This summer, for example, it is selling everything from chocolate-covered wasabi peas to chicken wings coated in tequila and sansho pepper. \"We should sell something for everyone,\" he says. \"Too many people in the UK are blinkered about food. There is always something new you can learn.\" According to Damian Dixon, the buyer on the trip, the retailer has already taken inspiration from Austin. It is testing a fleet of 14 branded food trucks in the Milton Keynes area, selling lunchtime sandwiches to workers in business parks away from the high street. But how do you take a product from obscurity into the mainstream? A few years ago, kale, quinoa and rice cakes could be found only in healthfood stores; now you can buy them in some petrol stations. According to food experts, turning an obscure foodstuff into a pantry staple requires \u2013 above all else \u2013 a total conviction that the product will be a hit with customers, even if those customers don't know it yet. Julian Metcalfe, co-founder of Pret a Manger and founder of the Asian-inspired Itsu chain, says you have to be brave. \"It's a question of having the guts to bring the product over. To import it, to pack it and to push it, rather than play safe. Take rice cakes with chocolate on them \u2013 we now sell 55,000 a week. No one had ever heard of them a few years ago.\" So where does the inspiration come from? \"A love and respect of food, and quite a lot of travelling,\" Metcalfe says. \"Look at coconut water. I sat with people in Brazil day after day at lunch and all they drank was coconut water, whereas in Thailand I believe they used to throw it away. I'd never seen it before. That was eight years ago.\" Henry Dimbleby, co-founder of the Leon chain of \"healthy fast food\" outlets, agrees that conviction is required to back an obscure foodstuff. A process of gradual osmosis can then turn it from tryout to trend. \"The way these things happen is that an individual or company believes that something's absolutely delicious and they put it in a context where people in the mainstream begin to understand it and get over their fears. Then other people do it, the papers write about it and it becomes a thing.\" Dimbleby says foodies such as himself are permanent magpies who are \"constantly travelling, eating, finding kernels of ideas and morphing them\". Dimbleby cites Leon's quinoa-heavy superfood salad as a dish that came from somewhere niche: \"When I was growing up, my mum [food writer Josceline Dimbleby] used to make salads that were quite substantial. They had vegetables in them, and were often dressed with bits of flavour running through them. Mum used to call them sumptuous salads. John [Vincent, Leon co-founder] came up with the name superfood salad in 2004, we Googled it and it didn't exist. We played with recipes. Our version had peas and greens and broccoli and sprouts, and it was delicious. The whole package added up to something that people understood. And it took off.\" Google \"superfood salad\" today and you'll get more than two million results. This is how all big consumer trends start, be they about music, books, fashion or food. Someone with foresight, money and enthusiasm co-opts something obscure and makes it part of life's fabric. It's why in hipster-land you can't move for kale. It's why Nick Clegg owns a onesie. According to Metcalfe, there is one golden rule worth remembering when trend-hunting: strange is a relative term. \"The thing is not weird in the place where you find it,\" he says. \"What's weird here is not weird there.\" For M&amp;S, the trick when introducing a new foodstuff is not to scare its customers. Rowe says the retailer's role is not to try to educate them, either. Rather, it must gently encourage them to try new things. When M&amp;S started selling sushi in the 1980s, it bombed. Customers weren't ready for another 20 years. Rowe's key lieutenant on this trip is Cathy Chapman, who is in charge of innovation. Softly-spoken Chapman, an M&amp;S old-timer, is a reluctant legend in food circles. It was she who ushered in Britain's ready-meal revolution in the 1970s, as an M&amp;S technologist. She also oversaw the introduction of mass-produced chicken kievs. Awaiting a plate of fried lobster at a pavement table as the first tendrils of a summer tornado whip the street \u2013 a tornado that just one hour later will prise roofs from buildings \u2013 Chapman explains how she persuades their customers to try something new. \"It can take quite a long time to take off because you've got to almost take the customer away from what she's been buying for a few years, like Indian or Chinese,\" she says. \"People might want tikka masala on a Friday night. You won't get them off that because it's been their ritual for several years. We can introduce them to smaller pieces [of new food] and sharing plate sizes. It's not such a risk and they can buy them on top of what they love, and gradually you can take them with you.\" Dishes from this trip will be presented and rigorously debated back at the London HQ. James Newton-Brown, the brand's chef and a veteran of most of London's high-end hotel kitchens, will work out if the flavours and cooking processes can be replicated, whether it's possible to make them at a good price, and also consider what he calls \"the practicality of eat\". \"It may taste and look good, but if people work in the City and have ties on, is it practical?\" he says of the sauce-heavy kimchi fries. Test versions will be made and products could hit the shelves by next summer. Whatever street food comes from this trip, it could be subject to certain limitations, commentators say. Due to the scale of what they do, big chains can struggle to recreate the intricacies of a dish. Kevin Gould, Guardian food and travel writer and now a branding expert, says food that is \"shot through with nuance and wit and subtlety\" cannot easily translate into \"mass-manufactured, factory-made food\". There is a profit motive to some of these trends. The nation's obsession with trendy kale is a godsend for chains such as M&amp;S, Gould says. \"Kale is cheap \u2013 it's basically slutty cabbage \u2013 so it's the best thing that could ever happen to them,\" he says. \"Stick a bit of kale in a juice, and you can sell it for \u00a32.50 as opposed to \u00a31.99.\" The last food trucks of the tour provide the lightbulb moments for the trend-hunters. At Turf N' Surf Po'Boy \u2013 an operation run by the bear-like Ralph Gilmore \u2013 a taco containing pulled pork and \"mango tango\" dressing proves a hit. Gilmore, who started opening trucks because they were cheaper than opening restaurants in \"fancy buildings\", is a leading light on the Austin food scene, with a weekly turnover of more than $50,000 (\u00a329,000). But it is a plate of his avocado deep-fried in sesame seeds, almonds, chilli flakes and cornflakes from a van called The Mighty Cone that gets the team most excited. \"Oh my God, it's fantastic,\" Chapman says. \"It's one of those things you'll remember all your life.\" Rowe takes a bite and almost leaps from the rickety picnic table with excitement: \"That is on my list of the best. To do that in the UK would be an absolute game-changer.\" There follows a detailed discussion about how they could get unfrozen avocado through the flash-frying process needed to create such a dish without damaging the produce. \"You have to apply technical cooking abilities that would stretch everyone,\" Rowe says. They all nod eagerly. They may be 5,000 miles from Tunbridge Wells, but here under the Texan sun they think they've struck gold. From avocado to kimchi: a short history of fashionable food Avocado When small green fruits called avocado pears first appeared on supermarket shelves in the 1960s, no one quite knew what to do with them \u2013 in Manchester one woman stewed them and served them with custard. Her letter of complaint to M&amp;S saw the retailer rebrand them and start selling them with an explanatory leaflet. Fast-forward 40 years and you can't move for guacamole and avocado smoothies. Sushi M&amp;S's attempts to sell it in the 1980s fell flat as consumers balked at the idea of eating raw fish. It took off in the 1990s thanks to the expansion of the Yo! Sushi chain and the opening of Nobu in London. Brits now spend about \u00a340m on the stuff every year. Popcorn Available in Britain for almost 100 years, but recently given a makeover. No hip party is now complete without a stall festooned with bunting and faux-Victorian signage offering popcorn in flavours such as cheese and tomato, wasabi, sea salt and olive oil, and even gin and tonic. Gourmet popcorn is so hot right now that the fact that many of these products taste like a wedge of cardboard that has absorbed the moisture at the bottom of the fridge is moot. Coconut water No longer the bit you throw away. This milky-coloured drink is high in potassium and is a big hit with gym bunnies and models, but it has now reached corner stores and kids' lunchboxes: 39 varieties are now sold in the UK, and sales are predicted to rise to \u00a3250m by 2017. Kale Kale \u2013 chewy and bland, but high in fibre and iron \u2013 is nothing new: it featured prominently in the Dig For Victory campaign during the second world war, but fell from favour soon after. Partly thanks to Oberon Sinclair, a canny British PR working for the American Kale Association, it has become the modern superfood of choice. Peak kale arrived when Beyonc\u00e9 put a picture of herself on Tumblr wearing a \"Kale\" sweatshirt with 'Kale' written on it. Kimchi This Korean fermented cabbage is part of the vogue for \"partially decayed\" foods that includes pickles and kombucha, a slightly fizzy fermented tea drink that is never far from Gwyneth Paltrow's fridge.",

      "body": "<p>In the vacant parking lot of an estate agency in downtown Austin, Texas, a British man in a white flannel shirt is setting out a row of paper plates along the top of a brick wall. Each plate is piled high with Korean-Mexican fusion food that he has bought from <a href=\"http://www.chilantrobbq.com\" title=\"\">Chi'Lantro</a>, one of hundreds of food trucks that dot the city's side streets and laybys.</p> <p>As the heat of the Texan evening subsides from unbearable to merely stifling, a young woman in towering heels strolls past with a piglet on a leash. Nobody bats an eyelid. After all, she's adhering to the instruction plastered on bumper stickers everywhere to \"Keep Austin Weird\".</p> <p>\"Right, tuck in,\" the British man tells the small group of people with him. He takes a forkful of kimchi fries: a plate of chips slathered in grilled onions, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Jack\" title=\"\">Monterey Jack cheese</a>, Korean barbecue meat, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sriracha_sauce\" title=\"\">Sriracha</a> dressing, a secret \"magic sauce\", sesame seeds and caramelised kimchi (fermented&#xa0;cabbage).</p> <p>\"You don't get it at first,\" he says, \"but then the heat builds on you. These are really good.\" \"It's a moreish combination,\" his friend adds. \"It ticks all the boxes in terms of flavour.\" They move down the wall, repeating the ritual with the Seoul burrito, the Korean burger and the bulgogi taco.</p> <p>These are not hungry tourists exploring Austin's culinary underbelly. The Brit in the flannel shirt is Steve Rowe, the man who runs Marks &amp; Spencer's food division; he is more or less the man who decides what middle England eats. Rowe and his three colleagues \u2013 a chef, a buyer and the chain's director of product direction and innovation \u2013 are on a trend-hunting trip to find products that they can adapt and sell, and they've invited me to join them. The retailer's food may end up in the fridges of Tunbridge Wells, but its journey starts in places such as this, the car park of Metro Realty. Austin is home to 1,000 food trucks.</p> <p>\"Our role is to pick up on the food trends that people see subliminally,\" Rowe explains in his London accent. \"The British public travels more than ever. What we want to be is one step ahead of them.\"</p> <p>Rowe should know what customers want: he has worked at M&amp;S for 25&#xa0;years, and his father, Joe, also ran the chain's food division, making them the only father-son team outside of the founding families to have held the same board position; his mother, aunt, maternal grandmother and wife also worked there. Between them, the extended Rowes have clocked up more than 100 years' service.</p> <p>Young Rowe was surrounded by M&amp;S food at home. He recalls eating \"steak after steak after steak\" when his father was experimenting with new packaging techniques in the 1980s. No family restaurant meal could start before a \"forensic discussion about the cut of meat\" had taken place. His father, now 67, still offers advice. When Rowe told him he'd got the food job in 2012, his dad congratulated him before telling him the store was cutting its calves' livers wrong.</p> <p>While eating from roadside shacks might strike some people as an extreme form of market research for one of Britain's more buttoned-up institutions, M&amp;S is playing into a growing trend. \"Food today is all about exploration and innovation,\" says Martin Raymond, co-founder of&#xa0;research body <a href=\"http://thefuturelaboratory.com/uk/\" title=\"\">The Future Laboratory</a>. With household budgets under pressure, Brits are spending more on eating in and less on going out.&#xa0;In other words, if a supermarket can sate the&#xa0;public's desire for exotic food they can eat at home, it has cracked a lucrative nut. M&amp;S has some form here: it was the first retailer to sell grapefruits to UK households in the 1930s, and introduced the chicken kiev to the UK in 1979; more recently, a trip to Chicago a few years ago resulted in the \"posh dog\", a smoky, hot dog-style sausage. Nearly a million units were sold last&#xa0;year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-441902044\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/9/1404900616833/Kimchi-fries-009.jpg\" alt=\"Kimchi fries\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kimchi fries: 'You don\u2019t get it at first, but then the heat builds on you. These are really good.' Photograph: Sandy Carson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Outside a Cajun food truck on the University of Texas campus half an hour later, Rowe is perusing the menu. \"Can I taste your gumbo?\" he asks the shack owner. \"I want to try the alligator, but we might have a sourcing issue.\" Would M&amp;S shoppers really throw crawfish boil into their basket along with their bread, milk and bananas? Absolutely, he claims. About 20% of the store's 6,000-plus products are new every year. This summer, for example, it is selling everything from chocolate-covered wasabi peas to chicken wings coated in tequila and sansho pepper. \"We should sell something for everyone,\" he says. \"Too many people in the UK are blinkered about food. There is always something new you can learn.\"</p> <p>According to Damian Dixon, the buyer on the trip, the retailer has already taken inspiration from Austin. It is testing a fleet of 14 branded food trucks in the Milton Keynes area, selling lunchtime sandwiches to workers in business parks away from the high street.</p> <p>But how do you take a product from obscurity into the mainstream? A few years ago, kale, quinoa and rice cakes could be found only in healthfood stores; now you can buy them in some petrol stations. According to food experts, turning an obscure foodstuff into a pantry staple requires \u2013 above all else \u2013 a total conviction that the product will be a hit with customers, even if those customers don't know it yet.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.julianmetcalfe.com\" title=\"\">Julian Metcalfe</a>, co-founder of Pret a Manger and founder of the Asian-inspired Itsu chain, says&#xa0;you have to be brave. \"It's a question of having the guts to bring the product over. To&#xa0;import it, to pack it and to push it, rather than play safe. Take rice cakes with chocolate on them \u2013 we now sell 55,000 a week. No one had ever heard of them a few years ago.\"</p> <p>So where does the inspiration come from? \"A love and respect of food, and quite a lot of travelling,\" Metcalfe says. \"Look at coconut water. I sat with people in Brazil day after day at lunch and all they drank was coconut water, whereas in Thailand I believe they used to throw it away. I'd never seen it before. That was eight years ago.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/henry-dimbleby\" title=\"\">Henry Dimbleby</a>, co-founder of <a href=\"http://leonrestaurants.co.uk\" title=\"\">the Leon chain of \"healthy fast food\"</a> outlets, agrees that conviction is required to back an obscure foodstuff. A process of gradual osmosis can then turn it from tryout to trend. \"The way these things happen is that an individual or company believes that something's absolutely delicious and they put it in a context where people in the mainstream begin to understand it and get over their fears. Then other people do it, the papers write about it and it becomes a thing.\"</p> <p>Dimbleby says foodies such as himself are permanent magpies who are \"constantly travelling, eating, finding kernels of ideas and morphing them\".</p> <p>Dimbleby cites Leon's quinoa-heavy superfood salad as a dish that came from somewhere niche: \"When I was growing up, my mum [food writer Josceline Dimbleby] used to make salads that were quite substantial. They had vegetables in them, and were often dressed with bits of flavour running through them. Mum used to call them sumptuous salads. John [Vincent, Leon co-founder] came up with the name superfood salad in 2004, we Googled it and it didn't exist. We played with recipes. Our version had peas and greens and broccoli and sprouts, and it was delicious. The whole package added up to something that people understood. And it took off.\" Google \"superfood salad\" today and you'll get more than two million&#xa0;results.</p> <p>This is how all big consumer trends start, be they about music, books, fashion or food. Someone with foresight, money and enthusiasm co-opts something obscure and makes it part of life's fabric. It's why in hipster-land you can't move for kale. It's why Nick Clegg owns a onesie. According to Metcalfe, there is one golden rule worth remembering when trend-hunting: strange is a relative term. \"The thing is not weird in the place where you find it,\" he says. \"What's weird here is not weird there.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-441902045\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/9/1404901028254/Food-Tasting-in-Austin-Te-009.jpg\" alt=\"Food Tasting in Austin Texas\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We have to look at the practicality of eat. It may taste and look good \u2013 but if people have ties on,\u00a0is it practical?\u2019 Photograph: Sandy Carson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For M&amp;S, the trick when introducing a new foodstuff is not to scare its customers. Rowe says the retailer's role is not to try to educate them, either. Rather, it must gently encourage them to&#xa0;try new things. When M&amp;S started selling sushi in the 1980s, it bombed. Customers weren't ready for another 20 years. Rowe's key lieutenant on this trip is Cathy Chapman, who is in charge of innovation. Softly-spoken Chapman, an M&amp;S old-timer, is a&#xa0;reluctant legend in food circles. It was she who ushered in Britain's ready-meal revolution in the 1970s, as an M&amp;S technologist. She also oversaw the introduction of mass-produced chicken kievs.</p> <p>Awaiting a plate of fried lobster at a pavement table as the first tendrils of a summer tornado whip the street \u2013 a tornado that just one hour later will prise roofs from buildings \u2013 Chapman explains how she persuades their customers to try something new. \"It can take quite a long time to take off because you've got to almost take the customer away from what she's been buying for a few years, like Indian or Chinese,\" she says. \"People might want tikka masala on a Friday night. You won't get them off that because it's been their ritual for several years. We&#xa0;can introduce them to smaller pieces [of new food] and sharing plate sizes. It's not such a risk and they can buy them on top of what they love, and gradually you can take them with you.\"</p> <p>Dishes from this trip will be presented and rigorously debated back at the London HQ. James Newton-Brown, the brand's chef and&#xa0;a&#xa0;veteran of most of London's high-end hotel kitchens, will work out&#xa0;if the flavours and cooking processes can be replicated, whether it's possible to make them at a good price, and also consider what he calls \"the practicality of eat\". \"It may taste and look good, but if people work in the City and have ties on, is it practical?\" he says of the sauce-heavy kimchi fries. Test versions will be made and products could hit the shelves by next summer.&#xa0;</p> <p>Whatever street food comes from this trip, it could be subject to certain limitations, commentators say.

    "webTitle": "Burberry shareholders revolt over Christopher Bailey's pay package", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry has faced a huge revolt over pay with 52.7% of investors voting against the company's remuneration report after it handed the new chief executive Christopher Bailey a one-off award of shares worth nearly \u00a315m last year. Speaking afterwards, the Burberry chairman, Sir John Peace, said the vote against was \"very disappointing\". \"What we have to do is reflect on that and talk to shareholders,\" he said. The vote on the remuneration report is non-binding but just over 16% of investors also voted against the company's remuneration policy at the company's annual general meeting in central London. Prior to the meeting a chorus of investor groups including Pirc and the Investment Management Association (IMA) flagged their concerns about the British fashion house's pay policies. The 52% no vote is one of the biggest-ever protests staged by shareholders against boardroom pay. Insurer Aviva suffered a 60% vote against its pay (including abstentions) in 2012 to protest against a \u00a32.2m golden hello for its incoming head of UK operations, resulting in the departure of its chief executive Andrew Moss. In 2013, nearly 40% of investors failed to support a $4m (\u00a32.5m) share award for the chief executive of mining company Randgold Resources. And in 2012, nearly one-third of shareholders declined to back Barclay's pay policy, including a \u00a317m deal for its controversial then chairman Bob Diamond. Bailey, who succeeded long-serving chief executive Angela Ahrendts in May, holds the title of chief creative and chief executive officer. The pay package for his enlarged role includes a \u00a31.1m salary, annual cash bonus of up to twice salary as well as share awards worth up to four times salary. His contract also includes a \u00a3440,000 cash allowance. In addition the company handed Bailey 1m free shares last summer. Pirc, which advised shareholders to vote against the company's remuneration policy, had cautioned that executive directors' incentive schemes were \"excessive\" as potential payouts could be as much as eight times base salary. The IMA, whose members manage \u00a34.5tn of assets, issued an \"amber top\" alert over pay \u2013 its second most serious level of rebuke on corporate governance. During the meeting, Peace explained that the share award was made to Bailey after a rival luxury goods company tried to poach him. \"We are acutely aware that Christopher could command a much higher package outside the UK.\" The company has a history of rewarding its executives handsomely. Bailey's predecessor Ahrendts, who left to join Apple in May, was one of the highest paid chief executives in the FTSE 100. Indeed, the American smashed through the glass ceiling to become the first female to top Britain's executive pay league after she earned \u00a316.9m in 2012. The near \u00a317m package included bonuses, benefits and proceeds from the sale of bonus shares. In her final year in charge, Ahrendts took home more than \u00a39m after being granted early access to share bonuses worth \u00a36.2m and a cash bonus worth \u00a32.1m. Investors have accepted the pay situation as the management team have been incredibly successful - Ahrendts and Bailey worked side by side for eight years. Last year adjusted pretax profits rose 8% to \u00a3461m while sales increased 17% to \u00a32.3bn. Burberry argues that Bailey, who joined as design director in 2001, is vital to its success and that his pay is in line with other global luxury-goods companies. For example, Prada's Miuccia Prada reportedly earned \u00a311.7m in 2013.",

      "body": "<p>Burberry has faced a huge revolt over pay with 52.7% of investors voting against the company's remuneration report after it handed the new chief executive Christopher Bailey a one-off award of shares worth nearly \u00a315m last year.</p> <p>Speaking afterwards, the Burberry chairman, Sir John Peace, said the vote against was \"very disappointing\".</p> <p>\"What we have to do is reflect on that and talk to shareholders,\" he said.</p> <p>The vote on the remuneration report is non-binding but just over 16% of investors also voted against the company's remuneration policy at the company's annual general meeting in central London. Prior to the meeting a chorus of investor groups including Pirc and the Investment Management Association (IMA) flagged their concerns about the British fashion house's pay policies.</p> <p>The 52% no vote is one of the biggest-ever protests staged by shareholders against boardroom pay. Insurer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/03/aviva-shareholder-rebellion-executive-pay\" title=\"\">Aviva suffered a 60% vote against its pay</a> (including abstentions) in 2012 to protest against a \u00a32.2m golden hello for its incoming head of UK operations, resulting in the departure of its chief executive Andrew Moss.</p> <p>In 2013, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/29/randgold-resources-biggest-shareholder-revolt\" title=\"\">nearly 40% of investors failed to support a $4m (\u00a32.5m) share award for the chief executive of mining company Randgold Resources</a>. And in 2012,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/27/barclays-agm-shareholder-anger?INTCMP=SRCH&amp;guni=Article:in%20body%20link\" title=\"\"> nearly one-third of shareholders declined to back Barclay's pay policy</a>, including a \u00a317m deal for its controversial then chairman Bob Diamond.</p> <p>Bailey, who succeeded long-serving chief executive Angela Ahrendts in May, holds the title of chief creative and chief executive officer. The pay package for his enlarged role includes a \u00a31.1m salary, annual cash bonus of up to twice salary as well as share awards worth up to four times salary. His contract also includes a \u00a3440,000 cash allowance. In addition the company handed Bailey 1m free shares last summer.</p> <p>Pirc, which advised shareholders to vote against the company's remuneration policy, had cautioned that executive directors' incentive schemes were \"excessive\" as potential payouts could be as much as eight times base salary. The IMA, whose members manage \u00a34.5tn of assets, issued an \"amber top\" alert over pay \u2013 its second most serious level of rebuke on corporate governance.</p> <p>During the meeting, Peace explained that the share award was made to Bailey after a rival luxury goods company tried to poach him. \"We are acutely aware that Christopher could command a much higher package outside the UK.\"</p> <p>The company has a history of rewarding its executives handsomely. Bailey's predecessor Ahrendts, who left to join Apple in May, was one of the highest paid chief executives in the FTSE 100. Indeed, the American smashed through the glass ceiling to become the first female to top Britain's executive pay league after she earned \u00a316.9m in 2012. The near \u00a317m package included bonuses, benefits and proceeds from the sale of bonus shares. In her final year in charge, Ahrendts took home more than \u00a39m after being granted early access to share bonuses worth \u00a36.2m and a cash bonus worth \u00a32.1m.</p> <p>Investors have accepted the pay situation as the management team have been incredibly successful - Ahrendts and Bailey worked side by side for eight years. Last year adjusted pretax profits rose 8% to \u00a3461m while sales increased 17% to \u00a32.3bn.</p> <p>Burberry argues that Bailey, who joined as design director in 2001, is vital to its success and that his pay is in line with other global luxury-goods companies. For example, Prada's Miuccia Prada reportedly earned \u00a311.7m in 2013.</p>",

The financial policy committee, an arm of the Bank of England, said a leverage ratio could be needed in addition to a risk weighted ratio to make sure banks keep enough capital aside during boom years in case of a financial credit crunch. In a consultation document, the FPC said building societies, which have stayed outside the casino-style international markets, would be caught by the new rules and may be forced to either diversify or charge their customers higher mortgage rates to raise the necessary capital. Most major countries with large financial centres are redesigning their regulation of banks to make them more secure. The FPC wants to include a leverage ratio to force banks that underestimate the risks they take to also hold capital based on the size of their loan book. Many building societies already have higher capital ratios than the major banks, but some could be caught by the new rules depending on the level eventually set by the regulator. It is expected that whatever rules and leverage ratios are agreed will take effect in 2019. The chancellor asked the FPC last year to examine all the ways financial institutions could be made to protect against a sudden financial collapse. The Basel committee, which oversees international banking regulation, has established a basic framework for capital ratios. The UK imposed a temporary leverage ratio on the largest systemically risky banks following the financial crisis. But Basel is not expected to begin discussion of leverage ratios until 2017.",

The US companies are in advanced talks about a deal that would combine the second and third biggest US cigarette makers. Imperial is in line to buy up brands they could be made to sell by the US competition authorities \u2013 a deal that would accelerate its desired expansion in the US. The news sent Imperial's shares up 3.9% to \u00a327.63, making the company the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 index. The UK company, whose brands include Gauloises, JPS and USA Gold, said: \"Imperial confirms it is in discussions with Reynolds and Lorillard to evaluate a possible acquisition of certain assets and brands owned by Reynolds and Lorillard. \"The USA remains one of the world's largest and most profitable cigarette markets. Imperial would proceed with an acquisition only if its terms met strict transaction criteria.\" Reynolds' brands include Camel and Pall Mall while Lorillard's include Newport and Kent. A spokesman for Imperial declined to discuss which brands the company might acquire. Reports have said the Bristol-based company could spend up to $7bn (\u00a34bn) to buy surplus assets from the merger that could include Reynolds' Kool and Salem. Reynolds and Lorillard have been in talks for months over a deal complicated by competition concerns and British American Tobacco's 42% stake in Reynolds. The deal, and the sale of assets to Imperial, would leave Imperial as one of three big players in the $90bn US tobacco market. Alison Cooper, Imperial's boss and one of the few FTSE 100 female chief executives, has been looking for ways to accelerate the company's growth. Buying brands from the US companies would give Imperial extra scale in the US, which remains the third biggest consumer of cigarettes in the world despite years of decline. About half the US market is controlled by Altria, which makes Marlboro. Imperial entered the US in 2007 by buying Commonwealth Brands, which was then the fourth biggest American tobacco company. The UK company said in May that its flagship USA Gold brand had gained market share in target states and that growth in the US was one of its main goals.",

      "bodyText": "The Church of England has finally cut its financial links with Wonga, the controversial payday lender, it was announced on Thursday. The church commissioners for England said that their indirect exposure to Wonga in their investment portfolio had been removed. They \"no longer have any financial or any other interest in Wonga\" and said that the church had not made any profit from its stake in the lender. The archbishop of Canterbury attacked payday lenders in July 2013, claiming that they had destroyed lives and that he wanted to \"compete Wonga out of existence\". However, Justin Welby said he was very embarrassed when it was revealed less than 24 hours later that the church had an indirect investment in Wonga, despite having added payday lenders to its list of prohibited investments. The Church of England held a \u00a375,000 stake in the company through a complex series of venture capital funds. Critics of the \u00a32bn a year payday loan industry have accused it of preying on the financially vulnerable for whom small loans quickly spiral as fees and interest are added on. A statement from the church said that the commissioners had never invested directly in Wonga or in any other payday lender: \"The indirect exposure of the commissioners through pooled funds represented considerably less than 0.01% of the value of Wonga. The church commissioners estimate that if they had had to sell their entire venture capital holdings they might have lost \u00a33.9m to remove the exposure to Wonga, which was worth less than \u00a3100,000. The commissioners are pleased that another way forward has been agreed.\" The commissioners also said that they had tightened their restrictions on direct investments and would announce new controls on indirect investments later this year. A new position was being created in the investment team to ensure that its ethical policies were implemented, supporting the church's ethical investment advisory group. It emerged last year that the church's investment managers were aware of the Wonga investment but had not passed it on to the archbishop or the commissioners. Gavin Oldham, a member of the church's ethical advisory group, also said at the time that the revelation was very embarrassing, adding: \"The investment was very deep down in the fund, but a holding like that is very high profile and it is important to make people aware of it.\" Welby made the reference to Wonga in an interview in which he said he wanted to use the resources of the church to offer an alternative to payday lenders. The commissioners said they would continue to support the church's aim of promoting responsible credit and savings. Last year they gave \u00a3200,000 in start-up funding to the church's new credit union, the Churches' Mutual Credit Union. Wonga was not available for comment.",
