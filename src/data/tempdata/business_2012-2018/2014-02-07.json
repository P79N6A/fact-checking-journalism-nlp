      "bodyText": "The department that deals with US unemployment fuelled fears that the country's job market recovery could have stalled when it said the economy added only 113,000 new jobs in January. Economists had been expecting around 180,000 new jobs, and this was the second month of disappointing jobs news from the department of labour, which last month surprised economists by saying that the US had added just 74,000 jobs in December, well below the 200,000 some had expected. That has been revised up to 75,000. Last year the economy added an average of 194,000 jobs per month. Official figures show the number of unemployed was little changed in January, at 10.2m, with the unemployment rate down just 0.1% to 6.6%. The percentage of the population in or looking for work edged up to 63% from a three-decade low of 62.8% last month. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) fell by 232,000, but the figure was probably affected by the fact that a million Americans lost their extended federal unemployment benefits at the end of December. Even so, the figure remains high at 3.6m \u2013 making up 35.8% of the ranks of the unemployed. But stockmarkets on both sides of the Atlantic shrugged off the news to send share values up as analysts partly blamed the weather and traders focused on expectations of further economic strength. The FTSE 100 climbed 13 points to 6,571 while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 105 points to 15,733. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said: \"Cold and stormy winter weather continued to weigh on the job numbers. Underlying job growth, abstracting from the weather, remains sturdy. Gains are broad-based across industries and company sizes, the biggest exception being manufacturing, which shed jobs \u2013 but that is not expected to continue.\" The jobs news comes against a background of steady improvement in many other areas of the US economy, pushing the annual rate of growth in the last three months of 2013 to 3.2%. Britain's outlook also improved after figures showed the trade deficit narrowed sharply in December, helped by rising exports to countries beyond Europe. The boost to the UK's trade position exceeded economists' expectations and raised hopes that exports finally helped lift the overall economy at the end of last year after dragging on growth over the summer. But a rise in manufacturing output of 0.3% in December showed the sector failed to grow as fast as hoped. The UK still has some way to go to squeeze its deficit to the level of France's, which was \u20ac61bn in 2013, and both countries lie well behind Germany, which registered a \u20ac200bn surplus last year. Analysts said the UK's figures failed to support the government's push to rebalance the economy away from consumer spending towards more manufacturing and exports. The deficit on trade in goods and services fell to an estimated \u00a31bn in December, compared with a gap of \u00a33.6bn in November, giving an annual trade deficit of \u00a3108.3bn. A fall in the number of insolvencies to an eight-year low in 2013 also cheered investors, though experts warned that already high levels of indebtedness could rise \"in the not too distant future\". The Insolvency Service said 101,000 people had become insolvent during the year, a fall of 7.9% on 2012's figure.",

    "webTitle": "Barclays: where smaller pies mean bigger slices for staff", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u2022 Tell us it's not true, saintly Antony. Have you really increased bonuses at Barclays' investment bank while revenues and profits are falling and shareholders are still digesting autumn's thumping \u00a36bn rights issue? Are you already taking a detour from the \"multi-year path to reposition Barclays remuneration\", as last year's annual report piously put it? Barclays shareholders will learn on Tuesday with the full-year results that the reports are accurate. Chief executive Antony Jenkins and the board have indeed sanctioned an increase in bonuses at the investment bank in a year in which the unit's revenues fell. In other words, the pie has shrunk in size but the well-paid employees will receive a larger slice at the expense of investors. That is not what Barclays promised. \"I hope that 2012 will be seen as a turning point in the way Barclays approaches remuneration,\" Sir John Sunderland, chairman of the pay committee, wrote in last year's annual report. \"For 2012 and in future we are taking a different approach to the balance between directors' and employees' remuneration, and returns for shareholders.\" Jenkins may offer various explanations. The blasted EU bonus cap has sown confusion and Wall Street rivals are exploiting the situation by waving large carrots at Barclays' most prized staff. Thus the bank has had to respond in kind to remain competitive. This argument, as far as it goes, is coherent. It is true that the shareholders of JP Morgan et al are a feeble bunch and have been happy to let the bonus party roll on even as the bills for the last knees-up continue to pile up. Jamie Dimon's $20m (\u00a315m) pay packet after another year of litigation hell at JP Morgan is merely the most striking example. But Jenkins should talk straight to his shareholders. He is clearly sincere about his clean-up programme; and he himself is prepared to share the pain for \"legacy litigation and conduct issues\" by declining a bonus for 2013. But is he also saying that Barclays, on pay, is still a prisoner of the demands of the senior staff in its investment bank? If so, where is the long-term gain for shareholders? The unit occasionally, as in 2012, earns returns in excess of Barclays' cost of capital, the true measure of profitability. But if, in the \"down\" years, new-look Barclays still feels the need to play the greed game to retain a seat at the table, what is the point of staying in investment banking? \u2022 Cold logic says AO, an online retailer of fridges, freezers and microwaves coming to the stock market next month, would be absurdly over-priced at \u00a31bn. The company made top-line profits of only \u00a310.7m last year on sales of \u00a3275m and margins on electrical goods are notoriously thin for the retailer. Gut instinct, however, says this flotation will generate a stampede of investors. AO is clearly a high-quality outfit. John Roberts, founder and 40% owner, has got something right if he has travelled this far on only \u00a33m of investment and no bank borrowings. This does not seem to be a business that requires vast sums of capital to expand. The magic ingredients are claimed as smart logistics, proprietary IT and excellent customer service. All e-commerce companies make similar boasts, of course, but AO can at least point to proper profits, a rapid shift in its market towards online shopping and a route to expansion \u2013 Germany, in the first instance, plus the addition of TVs to the range. To justify a \u00a31bn price-tag, you have to believe that AO's profit margins can rise substantially from last year's 3.8% with the benefits of greater size and that German expedition can be executed without cock-ups. Both propositions are untested and Dixons remains a strong competitor in the UK. So, in a rational world, \u00a3300m-ish for AO would more fairly reflect the risks and potential rewards of investment. But, if the stock market is willing to value loss-making Ocado at \u00a33bn, there will be buyers for AO at \u00a31bn. \u2022 Stephen Billingham, chairman of pub landlord Punch Taverns, declared last month that it would be \"economically rational\" for all parties to agree the terms of his take-it-or-leave-it deal for bondholders to restructure \u00a32.3bn-worth of securitised debt.

      "body": "<p>\u2022 Tell us it's not true, saintly Antony. Have you really increased bonuses at Barclays' investment bank while revenues and profits are falling and shareholders are still digesting autumn's thumping \u00a36bn rights issue? Are you already taking a detour from the \"multi-year path to reposition Barclays remuneration\", as last year's annual report piously put it?</p> <p>Barclays shareholders will learn on Tuesday with the full-year results that the reports are accurate. Chief executive Antony Jenkins and the board have indeed sanctioned an increase in bonuses at the investment bank in a year in which the unit's revenues fell.</p> <p>In other words, the pie has shrunk in size but the well-paid employees will receive a larger slice at the expense of investors.</p> <p>That is not what Barclays promised. \"I hope that 2012 will be seen as a turning point in the way Barclays approaches remuneration,\" Sir John Sunderland, chairman of the pay committee, wrote in last year's annual report.</p> <p>\"For 2012 and in future we are taking a different approach to the balance between directors' and employees' remuneration, and returns for shareholders.\"</p> <p>Jenkins may offer various explanations. The blasted EU bonus cap has sown confusion and Wall Street rivals are exploiting the situation by waving large carrots at Barclays' most prized staff. Thus the bank has had to respond in kind to remain competitive.</p> <p>This argument, as far as it goes, is coherent. It is true that the shareholders of JP Morgan et al are a feeble bunch and have been happy to let the bonus party roll on even as the bills for the last knees-up continue to pile up. Jamie Dimon's $20m (\u00a315m) pay packet after another year of litigation hell at JP Morgan is merely the most striking example.</p> <p>But Jenkins should talk straight to his shareholders. He is clearly sincere about his clean-up programme; and he himself is prepared to share the pain for \"legacy litigation and conduct issues\" by declining a bonus for 2013. But is he also saying that Barclays, on pay, is still a prisoner of the demands of the senior staff in its investment bank? If so, where is the long-term gain for shareholders?</p> <p>The unit occasionally, as in 2012, earns returns in excess of Barclays' cost of capital, the true measure of profitability. But if, in the \"down\" years, new-look Barclays still feels the need to play the greed game to retain a seat at the table, what is the point of staying in investment banking?</p> <p>\u2022 Cold logic says AO, an online retailer of fridges, freezers and microwaves coming to the stock market next month, would be absurdly over-priced at \u00a31bn. The company made top-line profits of only \u00a310.7m last year on sales of \u00a3275m and margins on electrical goods are notoriously thin for the retailer.</p> <p>Gut instinct, however, says this flotation will generate a stampede of investors. AO is clearly a high-quality outfit. John Roberts, founder and 40% owner, has got something right if he has travelled this far on only \u00a33m of investment and no bank borrowings. This does not seem to be a business that requires vast sums of capital to expand.</p> <p>The magic ingredients are claimed as smart logistics, proprietary IT and excellent customer service. All e-commerce companies make similar boasts, of course, but AO can at least point to proper profits, a rapid shift in its market towards online shopping and a route to expansion \u2013 Germany, in the first instance, plus the addition of TVs to the range.</p> <p>To justify a \u00a31bn price-tag, you have to believe that AO's profit margins can rise substantially from last year's 3.8% with the benefits of greater size and that German expedition can be executed without cock-ups. Both propositions are untested and Dixons remains a strong competitor in the UK. So, in a rational world, \u00a3300m-ish for AO would more fairly reflect the risks and potential rewards of investment.</p> <p>But, if the stock market is willing to value loss-making Ocado at \u00a33bn, there will be buyers for AO at \u00a31bn.</p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Billingham, chairman of pub landlord Punch Taverns, declared last month that it would be \"economically rational\" for all parties to agree the terms of his take-it-or-leave-it deal for bondholders to restructure \u00a32.3bn-worth of securitised debt.</p> <p>It was quite a claim as there are 16 classes of bonds and agreement is needed from each. Unfortunately for Billingham, holders of too many of those bonds don't share his assessment of economic self-interest. One irate bondholder describes the terms as \"unacceptable\" and the documentation as \"unsignable\".</p> <p>The chance of an 11th-hour agreement is roughly zero and the proposals will almost certainly be voted down next Friday.</p> <p>Several wet towels are required to understand the technicalities of all the quarrels here.

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has confirmed plans to bid for the struggling Elverys sports chain in Ireland as its battle with Adidas over sales of replica sporting kit goes international. Dave Forsey, the chief executive of Sports Direct, said: \"Elverys would be an excellent strategic fit for Sports Direct in the Republic of Ireland, giving us essential access to the important rugby replica kit market.\" The British retailer, founded by the Newcastle United owner, Mike Ashley, already owns a 50% stake of the Heatons department store chain in Ireland. In a similar move to its restriction on supply of Adidas-sponsored Chelsea replica kit to Sports Direct and other stores in the UK, the German brand intends to limit supply of the locally important Munster rugby team kit to Heatons from this autumn. Heatons is already restricted from selling Leinster rugby kit sponsored by Canterbury, a brand owned by Pentland Group which is a major shareholder in rival JD Sports. Adidas announced plans to restrict sales of certain replica kit items from football and other sports across Europe last year. It said at the time: \"Like all manufacturers, we regularly review, season by season, where our products are distributed. We determine distribution channels for all products based on criteria such as in-store environment and customer service levels.\" Sports Direct is furious about the plan, which will also affect football World Cup team kits including Germany and Spain in the run-up to the competition this summer. Forsey said on Friday that the restrictions on Munster rugby kit would result in higher prices for shoppers in Ireland. \"The current Adidas segmentation policy is not in the interests of consumers,\" he said. Adidas said that only 17 out of 202 retailers in the UK and Ireland were affected by its new distribution policy and added: \"Heatons continues to be an important retailer for Adidas and their customers still have the opportunity to buy a great range of Adidas products in their stores.\" Sports Direct, which has been widely criticised in the UK over its use of zero-hours contracts for shopfloor staff, is flagging up the Adidas row as it attempts to win support for its Elverys bid after elbowing its way into takeover talks last weekend. Ireland's oldest sports chain with 55 stores, Elverys was to be sold to a management buyout team backed by the Irish financial firm Capnua. The deal was expected to be sewn up via a pre-pack administration, but this week the matter went into an open court process after Ashley flew to Dublin to personally intervene. Ireland's high court appointed an interim examiner to Staunton Sports, the owner of Elverys, this week. Once that role is confirmed, interested parties including Sports Direct will be asked to submit investment proposals to ensure the survival of the business. Ashley has already offered to pay \u20ac2.5m (\u00a32.1m) more than the \u20ac10m offered by the Elverys management. Elverys has been on the market for some months as part of efforts by its owners, John and James Staunton, to settle debts with Ireland's National Asset Management Agency, the \"bad bank\" that took on property development loans in the wake of the financial crash. Buying Elverys would consolidate Sports Direct's position in Ireland where it has 26 of its own-branded stores, has recently launched online and owns a 50% stake in Heatons, which has nearly 50 stores across Northern Ireland and the Republic.",

Helena Smith in Athens writes;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In what is bound to be another headache for Greece\u2019s shaky two-party government, the nation\u2019s Supreme Court, or Areo Pagos, judged that an emergency property tax, levied through electricity bills, was not only unfair but - by being unconstitutional- illegal to boot. With a ruling of three to two, Supreme Court judges argued that the tax, known commonly as the \u201charatsi,\u201d was wrong because it was calculated on the size of a property and not the economic means of tax payers already hit by an array of tax hikes, wage and pension cuts since the country descended into economic crisis.</p> <p>The verdict, which has yet to be rubberstamped, ruled that the relentless fiscal obligations imposed on citizens was an affront to their right to live with dignity and equality.</p> <p>Initially imposed as a temporary \u201cemergency\u201d tax in 2011, the levy has helped plug fiscal holes but is indisputably the most unpopular measure taken since the debt crisis began. From pensioners downwards, Greeks have seen their tax obligations increase seven-fold since 2010, prompting parliament\u2019s independent budgetary office last week to also announce that the imposition of so many taxes had not only exhausted Greeks but had become counter-productive in that it was now fuelling tax evasion.</p> <p>The ruling follows a series of judgments by the Council of State, the highest legal body in the land, declaring that wage cuts and loss of benefits imposed on security forces, doctors and university professors also be reimbursed by the state. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1c252b88-e81a-45c3-b691-bac9a5f4cec3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/7/1391795405034/b0c84982-7012-49e4-abcf-9c1a238947b0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Protesters shout slogans outside the State of Coucil in central Athens.

Fitch believes that developments in Ukraine warrant such a deviation from the calendar and our rationale for this is laid out below.</p> </blockquote> <p>It added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Political instability has increased markedly since Fitch\u2019s last rating review on 8 November 2013, adding to pressure on the sovereign credit profile. Street protests initially triggered at the end of November by the government\u2019s decision to reject an Association Agreement with the EU increased in scale and violence in mid-January, claiming several lives. The government response to the protests has weakened its popular legitimacy and put diplomatic ties under strain. Mykola Azarov resigned as Prime Minister at the end of January along with the rest of the government.</p> <p>Sovereign access to external financing and the sovereign\u2019s ability to refinance a heavy external debt repayment schedule, have deteriorated. Russia lent Ukraine $3bn of a $15bn lending package agreed in December, but has put further disbursements on hold pending the formation of a new government. Fitch has previously warned that further Russian support is likely conditional on President Yanukovych\u2019s continued political survival. We no longer assume the Russian loan will be disbursed in full, while Ukraine has lost external market access.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full report is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/detail.cfm?pr_id=820020\"> Fitch Downgrades Ukraine to \u2018CCC\u2019</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-eb59a03e-fec2-403a-be3f-7d0d18ee79ac\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/7/1391792625114/aa4f3009-b371-49f4-85fc-051d0d74fb52-460x339.jpeg\" alt=\"An anti-government demonstrator walks past a currency exchange office in Kiev.

Atlanta Fed President Lockhart, the FOMC\u2019s median voice, said on Wednesday: \u201c<i>When we get close to or even beyond the 6.5%, I think it is reasonable to expect the Federal Open Market Committee will revise forward guidance, maybe even well before that, to help the markets and the public have an ability to gauge how the economy is performing relative to some sense of goal</i>.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, the second lackluster payroll gain in a row at least questions whether the Fed will continue to moderate its asset purchases at its upcoming meeting. Our baseline view is that the clear majority of FOMC members wants to go on with the tapering and that it needs a string of fundamentally weak numbers to halt the tapering train. While the payroll numbers for December and January, as well as some other economic numbers for this period, have indeed disappointed, one must not forget that a good part of the weakness was caused by unusually cold winter weather.</p> <p>Ahead of the mid-March FOMC meeting, we will get several other data releases, including the February employment report, which should paint a less biased picture of the economy. If numbers improve as we expect, given our underlying optimism on the economic outlook, the Fed will continue to reduce the pace of its asset purchases in March.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52f4f1d4e4b0642b51ef7f04\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-07T14:51:47.459Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US adds fewer jobs than expected in January but jobless rate improves</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>From New York, our Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe writes:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US economy added just 113,00 new jobs in January, according to figures released on Friday, as the winter weather appeared to be taking its toll on the jobs market.</p> <p>Economists had been expecting the economy to add around 180,000 jobs.

The European court is expected to rubber-stamp the policy.</p> <p>The policy, unveiled by ECB chief Mario Draghi in August 2012 allows the central bank to buy up unlimited amounts of the sovereign debt of crisis-ridden countries.</p> <p>While it has not so far been put into action, its mere existence has effectively defused fears of an imminent break-up of the eurozone, and as such has proved the most effective tool in calming the crisis.</p> <p>Eighteen months ago the German court backed two other key eurozone crisis tools - the \u20ac500m European Stability Mechanism bailout fund, and the European fiscal pact.</p> <p>Today\u2019s move by the German court was widely seen as a way to dodge a decision that had become highly charged over the last year.</p> <p>The constitutional court had agreed to rule on the OMT under pressure from eurosceptics, who want to impose a German veto on \u201cunder the counter\u201d ECB subsidies.</p> <p>Judges at the court, which is based in Karlsruhe, made an initial assessment backing the eurospecticsand finding the OMT programme to be illegal \u2013 saying there were \u201cimportant reasons to assume that it [the OMT programme] exceeds the ECB\u2019s monetary policy mandate and thus infringes the powers of the member states\u201d. </p> <p>However, the court has now said it was not completely convinced by its own assessment.

The western Ionian island has been rattled by a series of quakes (the latest last night) since being convulsed by two strong temblors, the first 12 days ago. With more than 3,000 buildings damaged (and over 700 now needing to be torn down) inhabitants have resorted to sleeping in their cars with seismologists not ruling out the area being hit again in the imminent future.</p> <p>Cephalonia \u2013 which shot to fame internationally as the setting of Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin - has also suffered heavy damage to its infrastructure with its road network, schools and a local port being especially hard hit. For islanders already finding it hard to keep up with spiralling taxes and relentless budget cuts, the crisis could not come at a worse time. The disaster has highlighted the dangers near bankrupt Greece now faces in dealing with anything that, officials say, has not been factored in monetarily. </p> <p>\u201cIf there was ever a natural disaster the country in this state would never be able to cope,\u201d the IMF\u2019s former resident mission chief Bob Traa had told me early on in Greece\u2019s debt crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s our worst nightmare.\u201d </p> <p>Athens may have made fiscal progress in the meantime (last night the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras told an audience of businessmen in Frankfurt that, like the country\u2019s primary budget surplus, the recession rate in 2013 was likely to be much better than anticipated), but budgets are still especially tight. </p> <p>Deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos requested the aid during talks with Regional Policy Commissioner Johannes Hahn as he attended a conference in Athens (given in Greece\u2019s capacity as EU president), on strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian areas. Venizelos is believed to have conveyed the government\u2019s concerns that if allowed to go unchecked the natural disaster will effect tourism, the island\u2019s mainstay. Islanders have already been offered relief in the form of government grants to help cover damage and a reprieve from paying property taxes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fbe9a8ff-1bf1-484a-9b9c-0d1c791e6fea\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/7/1391776914269/44738c47-3c22-4f47-a9b9-eb267bd3724d-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Destroyed house in the village Livadia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A destroyed house in the village of Livadia.

Manufacturing has continued its strong growth and goods exports have hit a record high. But the job is not yet done, and as the IFS said only this week \u2018the largest challenge for the chancellor remains having to contend with the consequences of the Great Recession for the public finances and household incomes\u2019. That is why it\u2019s so important that we continue to work through the long-term plan that is delivering economic security for Britain\u2019s hardworking people.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But <b>Martin Beck</b>, UK economist at Capital Economics says today\u2019s data point to some rebalancing but it is by no means plain sailing from here.</p> <p>He comments:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cDecember\u2019s figures on industrial production and trade offer some mixed messages on whether the economy is achieving better balanced growth. On the one hand, momentum in industry may be easing. Given flat output in November, December\u2019s monthly rise of 0.3% in manufacturing output was fairly muted. And 0.4% growth in overall industrial production that month fell short of the 0.6% pencilled in by the ONS in its preliminary estimate of Q4 GDP growth. However, on its own, this is not enough to push down the estimated 0.7% rise in GDP in Q4.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, the trade data for December showed the UK\u2019s overall deficit in goods and services falling to an unexpectedly small \u00a31bn in December from \u00a33.6bn in the previous month. This was the biggest monthly narrowing since records began in 1998. Exports rose by 1.9% m/m while imports dropped by 4.7%. Note though that the latter was partly down to erratic factors, particularly a drop in imports of planes and ships. So the deficit is likely to widen again next month. Nonetheless, it looks like net trade will have added to growth in the final three months of 2014, following Q3\u2019s hefty drag. </p> </blockquote> <p>And <b>Lee Hopley,</b> chief economist at manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cManufacturers had a strong finish to 2013, but more encouraging, are the indicators we\u2019ve seen since the start of the year which suggest that positive trend has rolled into the early part of 2014.

In short, the Court gives a long explanation why it thinks that the OMT programme is illegal.</p> <p>However, there is one passage in the press statement which indicates that the Court is not totally convinced by its own assessment. According to the Court, OMT would be legal if it would not undermine the conditionality of the EFSF and ESM bailout programmes. This, however, in the eyes of the Court would require that the haircut option, which is part of the ESM treaty, should be excluded and that bond purchases are not unlimited. Particularly the issue of conditionality has frequently been emphasised by the ECB.</p> <p>It does not happen a lot that the German Constitutional Court passes sensitive decisions on to the European level. Today\u2019s announcement therefore could either be a sign that the Court has reached its legal limits on European issues or that the issue is so tricky and touchy that it is better to pass it on. As regards the short-term outlook, the announcement should clearly reduce the Karlsruhe fear factor for the ECB. But not entirely. It is not a given that the European Court of Justice will only rubber-stamp the OMT programme. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52f4b1d0e4b0c7b401a6b50c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-07T10:20:05.748Z\">10.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Turning to the UK briefly, we\u2019ve had mixed economic data this morning</b>. </p> <p>Official figures show Britain\u2019s trade deficit narrowed sharply at the end of last year but manufacturing failed to grow as strongly as hoped,<i> reports my colleague <b>Katie Allen</b>:</i></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/uktrade/uk-trade/december-2013/stb-uk-trade-december-2013.html\">The Office for National Statistics said </a>a rise in exports and a fall in imports helped the UK\u2019s deficit on trade in goods and services fall to an estimated \u00a31bn in December, compared with a deficit of \u00a33.6bn in November. <br><br>Trade data are erratic but it is good news for the government as it continues to push for rebalancing of the UK economy towards more external demand.</p> <p>The goods deficit \u2013 easier to assess than trade in services \u2013 was \u00a37.7bn, down from \u00a39.8bn in November.

      "bodyText": "In Greece, the country\u2019s Supreme Court has just declared an emergency property tax slapped on home owners via electricty bills to be unconstitutional. Helena Smith in Athens writes; In what is bound to be another headache for Greece\u2019s shaky two-party government, the nation\u2019s Supreme Court, or Areo Pagos, judged that an emergency property tax, levied through electricity bills, was not only unfair but - by being unconstitutional- illegal to boot. With a ruling of three to two, Supreme Court judges argued that the tax, known commonly as the \u201charatsi,\u201d was wrong because it was calculated on the size of a property and not the economic means of tax payers already hit by an array of tax hikes, wage and pension cuts since the country descended into economic crisis. The verdict, which has yet to be rubberstamped, ruled that the relentless fiscal obligations imposed on citizens was an affront to their right to live with dignity and equality. Initially imposed as a temporary \u201cemergency\u201d tax in 2011, the levy has helped plug fiscal holes but is indisputably the most unpopular measure taken since the debt crisis began. From pensioners downwards, Greeks have seen their tax obligations increase seven-fold since 2010, prompting parliament\u2019s independent budgetary office last week to also announce that the imposition of so many taxes had not only exhausted Greeks but had become counter-productive in that it was now fuelling tax evasion. The ruling follows a series of judgments by the Council of State, the highest legal body in the land, declaring that wage cuts and loss of benefits imposed on security forces, doctors and university professors also be reimbursed by the state. And on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again on Monday morning. Still with ratings, Standard and Poor\u2019s has moved the outlook for Turkey from stable to negative. Its rating is still BB+. Despite a rather mixed picture from the US non-farm payrolls reports, and weak Chinese services PMI data, the rally which began on Thursday has not run out of steam. The final scores were: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 13.40 points or 0.2% higher at 6571.68 \u2022 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.49% to 9301.92 \u2022 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.96% higher at 4228.18 \u2022 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB ended 0.96% better at 19,692.08 \u2022 Spain\u2019s Ibex rose 1.08% to 10,072.4 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 84 points or 0.54% higher. Perhaps not the biggest surprise in the world, but ratings agency Fitch has downgraded Ukraine. The move, from B- to CCC, comes ahead of the next timetabled rating review by Fitch, due on 28 February. But given the political and debt problems facing the country Fitch said: Fitch interprets [EU regulations] as allowing us to publish a rating review in situations where there is a material change in the creditworthiness of the issuer that we believe makes it inappropriate for us to wait until the next scheduled review... Fitch believes that developments in Ukraine warrant such a deviation from the calendar and our rationale for this is laid out below. It added: Political instability has increased markedly since Fitch\u2019s last rating review on 8 November 2013, adding to pressure on the sovereign credit profile. Street protests initially triggered at the end of November by the government\u2019s decision to reject an Association Agreement with the EU increased in scale and violence in mid-January, claiming several lives. The government response to the protests has weakened its popular legitimacy and put diplomatic ties under strain. Mykola Azarov resigned as Prime Minister at the end of January along with the rest of the government. Sovereign access to external financing and the sovereign\u2019s ability to refinance a heavy external debt repayment schedule, have deteriorated. Russia lent Ukraine $3bn of a $15bn lending package agreed in December, but has put further disbursements on hold pending the formation of a new government. Fitch has previously warned that further Russian support is likely conditional on President Yanukovych\u2019s continued political survival. We no longer assume the Russian loan will be disbursed in full, while Ukraine has lost external market access.

Commenting on Yahoo\u2019s switch, the Taoiseach said: \u201cThis is a commercial decision by Yahoo. It is not a directed decision from anybody.\u201d But Kenny also defended Ireland\u2019s low 12.5% corporation tax regime: \u201cWe have all of these companies in Ireland and the cluster impact creates its own energy and its own dynamism and it\u2019s own structure. Ireland has been very forthright and very upfront about our corporate tax position.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s central bank has imposed capital controls to bolster its currency as the country\u2019s political and debt crisis continues. The controls include a limit on private transfers abroad of around $5,700 a month or 50,000 hryvnia and bans on purchases of foreign currency for overseas investment or early repayment of loans. The full story is here (via Reuters): Ukraine imposes currency controls amid political crisis More from the Anglo Irish trial continuing in Dublin. Henry McDonald writes: Ireland\u2019s one time richest man Sean Quinn admitted to Ireland\u2019s financial regulator that he needed to be \u201creigned in\u201d over his build up of investments in the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank, the trial of three top Irish bankers was told today. Ahead of Quinn\u2019s own appearance in the witness box at Dublin\u2019s Central Criminal Court today, the 15 strong jury heard that Quinn himself said he had \u201cbeen greedy\u201d in his acquisition of shares in the bank that eventually almost bankrupted Ireland. The former billionaire who lost his fortune by borrowings billions from the Anglo Irish Bank is expected to give evidence shortly against three ex-bankers - Sean Fitzpatrick, Patrick Whelan and William McAteer. The trio are standing trial for unlawfully providing finance for 16 individuals including Sean Quinn in 2008. All three Anglo Irish Bank executives pleaded not guilty to the charges on day one of the court case on Wednesday. On the third day of what is expected to be one of the complex financial crime trials, the court heard that Quinn made his comments to the Republic\u2019s Financial Regulator Pat Neary during a meeting with him in February 2008 just months before the bank\u2019s collapse. His former chief executive of the Quinn Group, whose business ranged from concrete to insurance, Liam McCaffrey, revealed to the court that the regulator had fined his boss a record \u20ac3.5m for the way the tycoon was managing inter-company loans in order to keep a 24% stake in Anglo Irish Bank. The case earlier heard that Quinn was \u201ceternally optimistic\u201d about the shares in Anglo Irish Bank despite them plummeting in the year of the financial crash. The jobless data present a quandary for the US Federal Reserve, according to Unicredit Research chief US economist Dr Harm Bandholz: Today\u2019s report aggravates the problem for the Fed that we highlighted after the December employment report: On the one hand, the ongoing decline in the unemployment rate \u2013 which is now only 0.1 percentage point above the threshold in the forward guidance \u2013 means that an adjustment of the forward guidance is becoming more urgent. Atlanta Fed President Lockhart, the FOMC\u2019s median voice, said on Wednesday: \u201cWhen we get close to or even beyond the 6.5%, I think it is reasonable to expect the Federal Open Market Committee will revise forward guidance, maybe even well before that, to help the markets and the public have an ability to gauge how the economy is performing relative to some sense of goal.\u201d On the other hand, the second lackluster payroll gain in a row at least questions whether the Fed will continue to moderate its asset purchases at its upcoming meeting. Our baseline view is that the clear majority of FOMC members wants to go on with the tapering and that it needs a string of fundamentally weak numbers to halt the tapering train. While the payroll numbers for December and January, as well as some other economic numbers for this period, have indeed disappointed, one must not forget that a good part of the weakness was caused by unusually cold winter weather. Ahead of the mid-March FOMC meeting, we will get several other data releases, including the February employment report, which should paint a less biased picture of the economy. If numbers improve as we expect, given our underlying optimism on the economic outlook, the Fed will continue to reduce the pace of its asset purchases in March. From New York, our Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe writes: The US economy added just 113,00 new jobs in January, according to figures released on Friday, as the winter weather appeared to be taking its toll on the jobs market. Economists had been expecting the economy to add around 180,000 jobs. This is the second month of disappointing jobs news from the US Department of Labor, which last month surprised economists by saying that the US had added just 74,000 jobs in December, well below the 200,000 some had been expecting. That number has been revised up marginally to 75,000. Last year the economy added an average of 194,000 jobs per month. Both the number of unemployed persons, at 10.2m, and the unemployment rate, down 0.1% to 6.6%, changed little in January. The percentage of the population in or looking for work edged up to 63% from a three-decade low of 62.8% last month. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) fell by 232,000 but remains high at 3.6 million. These individuals accounted for 35.8% of the unemployed. The news comes after a last-ditch effort to extend an emergency program for the long-term unemployed failed to pass in the Senate on Thursday. More here: US adds just 113,000 January jobs as unemployment rate dips to 6.6% And with that, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. DING DING DING. Shares are rising in New York as the chimes of the Wall Street opening bell fade away. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen 50 points, or 0.3%, in early trades, as traders take the jobs report in their stride. European markets are also broadly higher too, with the FTSE 100 up 24 points now. Paul Ashwort, chief US economist at Capital Economics, also reckons the Fed will continue to slow the pace of its bond-buying programme: So payroll growth appears to have slowed but, given the strength of economic growth in the second half of last year, we expect to see a rebound in the monthly gains over the next few months. Moreover, with the unemployment rate down to only 6.6%, the Fed should continue to wind down its asset purchases. Rob Carnell of ING argues that the underlying picture in the US jobs market is stronger than today\u2019s report shows, saying: Bad weather in parts of the US that normally don\u2019t experience it at this time of the year probably mean that the number is better than appears in this release. And annual benchmark revisions also muddy the picture, although the news here is actually quite positive \u2013 with about half a million more people in work than had previously been calculated. He reckons the Fed will not be swayed from cutting its bond-programme again. So whilst markets will doubtless move first on the weak headline payrolls figure, we believe that the labour market release as a whole is not too bad, and expect market reactions to be short-lived. There is little question of the taper being reduced in response to this data. Ashraf Laidi, chief global strategist of cityindex.co.uk, comments: Net-net, the jobs figures are considered sufficiently positive for the US economy, but are at risk of re-activating the paradigm of \u201cgood news are bad for the market\u201d if they embolden Fed Chairwoman Yellen to make a hawkish testimony at her appearance to Congress next week, arguing for further tapering in monthly asset purchases and potentially jeopardising a fragile US recovery at a time when China, the world\u2019s 2nd largest economy is revealing continued signs of weakness in manufacturing and services. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about how the US labour market has suffered from inclement weather conditions in December and January, when heavy snow and ice storms struck the country. However, the breakdown in today\u2019s report shows that 48,000 new jobs were created in the US construction sector -- an industry exposed to the weather. There were also 21,000 new manufacturing jobs created, and 66 in the \u201cservice-providing\u201d sectors. But retailers laid off almost 13,000 workers. Markets were uncertain how to react to the worse than expected non-farm payrolls, given the headline figure of 113,000 was lower than forecast but the jobless rate at 6.6% was slightly better than the predicted 6.7%, our market reporter Nick Fletcher writes. Initially the FTSE 100, up 16 points before the data was released, fell back to show a 10 point loss, but this was soon reversed and the index is currently virtually unchanged. Dow futures, up around 52 points ahead of the jobs report, are now down 42 points. The US dollar initially slipped back against the yen and the pound. One important point - the Bureau of Labor Statistics has also published annual revisions to its data, showing that US employment was higher in 2013 than it thought. The total nonfarm employment level for March 2013 was revised upward by 369,000, it said, adding: After accounting for the annual adjustment to the population controls, the civilian labor force rose by 499,000 in January, and the labor force participation rate edged up to 63.0 percent. Total employment, as measured by the household survey, increased by 616,000 over the month, and the employment-population ratio increased by 0.2 percentage point to 58.8 percent. The US unemployment rate has fallen to a new five-year low of 6.6%. That\u2019s the lowest level since the collapse of Lehman Brothers sparked the biggest financial crisis in generations. And the Labour Force Participation (measuring the percentage of the population either employed or looking for a job) inched a little higher to 63.0%, from 62.8%. November\u2019s jobs report has been revised up, though -- to show a healthier reading of 274,000 new positions being created, up from 241,000 previously. In another surprise, there\u2019s no real change to December\u2019s weak non-farm payroll -- it\u2019s only been revised a little higher to 75,000 new jobs, from 74,000. So, for the second month running, the US jobs report has missed expectations -- remember, Wall Street was expecting an average of 180,000 new jobs. Breaking: Just 113,000 new jobs were created in the US economy in December, the Bureau of Labour Statistics reports. Bloomberg tracks all the various forecasts, predictions and guesses for the jobs report -- and it looks like the consensus has slipped to around 150,000 new jobs.... Right, nearly time for the main economic news of the day -- America\u2019s employment report. January\u2019s Non-farm payroll, which will be released at 1.30pm sharp, will show how many new jobs were created across the world\u2019s largest economy last month. On average, economists predict that 180,000 workers were hired (excluding the volatile agriculture sector) last month. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 6.7%. It\u2019s also possible that December NFP will be revised higher -- last month, the Labour ministry stunned the markets by saying a meagre 74,000 new jobs were created. Other important readings include the labour force participation rate, which measures the percentage of eligible adults actually in work or looking for it. The figures could also be hit by the expiration of emergency jobless welfare payments at the end of last year. Here\u2019s economics correspondent Phillip Inman on today\u2019s German court decision (full coverage starts at 9am GMT) A threat by Germany to outlaw the European Central Bank\u2019s most effective financial backstop for crisis-hit eurozone countries has been suspended after judges referred the dispute to Europe\u2019s highest court. The German Constitutional Court said doubts about the ultimate effects of the policy had persuaded it to set aside fears that the ECB\u2019s plan went beyond its remit and could result in taxpayers in richer countries subsiding poorer states. Passing the decision to the European Court of Justice, the German judges said it may be possible for the ECB to give countries on the edge of bankruptcy funds through its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) policy without breaching its rules. The European court is expected to rubber-stamp the policy. The policy, unveiled by ECB chief Mario Draghi in August 2012 allows the central bank to buy up unlimited amounts of the sovereign debt of crisis-ridden countries. While it has not so far been put into action, its mere existence has effectively defused fears of an imminent break-up of the eurozone, and as such has proved the most effective tool in calming the crisis. Eighteen months ago the German court backed two other key eurozone crisis tools - the \u20ac500m European Stability Mechanism bailout fund, and the European fiscal pact. Today\u2019s move by the German court was widely seen as a way to dodge a decision that had become highly charged over the last year. The constitutional court had agreed to rule on the OMT under pressure from eurosceptics, who want to impose a German veto on \u201cunder the counter\u201d ECB subsidies. Judges at the court, which is based in Karlsruhe, made an initial assessment backing the eurospecticsand finding the OMT programme to be illegal \u2013 saying there were \u201cimportant reasons to assume that it [the OMT programme] exceeds the ECB\u2019s monetary policy mandate and thus infringes the powers of the member states\u201d. However, the court has now said it was not completely convinced by its own assessment. It said the ECB could impose stringent requirements that offset the huge subsidies that flow from rescuing a member state from financial collapse. Carsten Brzeski, a eurozone analyst at Dutch bank ING, said: \u201cThe announcement could either be a sign that the court has reached its legal limits on European issues or that the issue is so tricky and touchy that it is better to pass it on.\u201d In the short term, he said the announcement \u201cshould clearly reduce the Karlsruhe fear factor for the ECB\u201d. The German constitutional court said it would issue its final ruling on the \u20ac500m ESM on March 18. But it also decided to consult the European Court of Justice with regard to the OMT because the ECB as a European body comes under the jurisdiction of the Luxembourg-based court. It would be the first time that the constitutional court has passed on a case to the European court. Over to Greece, the government is hoping for help from the European Union in dealing with its quake-rattled island of Cephalonia, now being described as a natural disaster zone. As Helena Smith reports from Athens, the appeal was made last night: After rushing in the army, dispatching tents and declaring a state of emergency, Athens\u2019 coalition government has now appealed to the European Solidarity Fund for help to cope with the natural disaster that has unfolded on Cephalonia. The western Ionian island has been rattled by a series of quakes (the latest last night) since being convulsed by two strong temblors, the first 12 days ago. With more than 3,000 buildings damaged (and over 700 now needing to be torn down) inhabitants have resorted to sleeping in their cars with seismologists not ruling out the area being hit again in the imminent future. Cephalonia \u2013 which shot to fame internationally as the setting of Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin - has also suffered heavy damage to its infrastructure with its road network, schools and a local port being especially hard hit. For islanders already finding it hard to keep up with spiralling taxes and relentless budget cuts, the crisis could not come at a worse time. The disaster has highlighted the dangers near bankrupt Greece now faces in dealing with anything that, officials say, has not been factored in monetarily. \u201cIf there was ever a natural disaster the country in this state would never be able to cope,\u201d the IMF\u2019s former resident mission chief Bob Traa had told me early on in Greece\u2019s debt crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s our worst nightmare.\u201d Athens may have made fiscal progress in the meantime (last night the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras told an audience of businessmen in Frankfurt that, like the country\u2019s primary budget surplus, the recession rate in 2013 was likely to be much better than anticipated), but budgets are still especially tight. Deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos requested the aid during talks with Regional Policy Commissioner Johannes Hahn as he attended a conference in Athens (given in Greece\u2019s capacity as EU president), on strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian areas. Venizelos is believed to have conveyed the government\u2019s concerns that if allowed to go unchecked the natural disaster will effect tourism, the island\u2019s mainstay. Islanders have already been offered relief in the form of government grants to help cover damage and a reprieve from paying property taxes. Interesting take (as ever) from FT Alphaville-- arguing the GCC have missed the whole point of OMT. I flagged up earlier that the court reckoned it could be legal if it wasn\u2019t unlimited and didn\u2019t distort the markets. This, Alphaville explains, gets Mario Draghi\u2019s objectives and the OMT\u2019s technical features backwards: That the OMT would be pari passu with ordinary bondholders \u2014 in other words, that the ECB would observe the ordinary terms of the assets it was buying and not cheat by seeking special treatment \u2014 was very important for markets. One reason the SMP could never have supported Spain and Italy was that size meant more subordination for private creditors precisely when the risk of sovereign default was high: the SMP was senior. That the OMT would be ex ante unlimited, meanwhile, was the whole point of its magic: it is a very difficult commitment for the market to test, ex ante, by the same token. This is why the OMT has worked without ever, actually, being activated. More here: The OMT \u2014 um, what does this thing do again? A Bundesverfassungsgericht guide The German constitutional court\u2019s decision to chuck the OMT hot potato into the hands of the European Court of Justice has just been welcomed by the European Commission. Spokesman Simon O\u2019Connor said: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that the (German) court has taken such a decision. We welcome the fact that the court has referred this question to the European Court of Justice.\u201d On that point, Christian Odendahl of Roubini Global Economics argues that Germany\u2019s constitutional court in Karlsruhe has slightly dented its own authority: Although one astute fund manager in London points to Germany\u2019s maturity over the issue: Open Europe have now published their \u2018flash analysis\u2019 of the German constitutional court (GCC) ruling. They warn that the OMT is now \u2018in limbo\u2019 while the European Court of Justice examines the Outright Monetary Transactions programme, and also point out that the GCC will eventually give its own view. Will the GCC still provide its own ruling? Yes, but likely only after the ECJ has ruled. The GCC seems to be stuck. It has serious concerns over the OMT and its compatibility with the EU treaties and German law. However, it feels it cannot rule on issues of German law until the questions over EU law have been settled \u2013 which are outside of its jurisdiction. Once the ECJ has ruled, the GCC will likely re-examine how the OMT fits with German law, however, it will be constrained by the ECJ\u2019s ruling and interpretation of EU law. Open Europe also warns that the ongoing uncertainty over OMT could cause \u201cjitters\u201d in the eurozone. For all the talk or institutional and structural change as well as national governments pushing reform, the OMT has been the key factor in easing the crisis. It certainly throws a new bout of uncertainty into the very fragile economic recovery in the eurozone. Here\u2019s the full note: I\u2019m the German Constitutional Court, get me out of here! Court sees ECB bond buying as illegal but refers questions to ECJ Katie Allen has looked into the Treasury\u2019s bullish claim at 11.06am that UK exports are at a record high... Yes, they were for 2013 as a whole. But so too were imports. The ONS says: \u201cIn 2013, the deficit on trade in goods narrowed by \u00a30.4 billion to \u00a3108.3 billion (annually). The level of exports increased to a record \u00a3304.3 billion in 2013, up 1.3% from \u00a3300.5 billion in 2012. However, the rise in exports was accompanied by an increase in imports to a record \u00a3412.6 billion in 2013, up 0.8% from \u00a3409.2 billion in 2012. Despite these record levels of exports and imports, annual growth in the value of trade in goods has slowed considerably since 2010 and 2011.\u201d In London, the UK Treasury has argued that today\u2019s trade data (a smaller than expected deficit) shows the recovery continues. A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cToday\u2019s trade and manufacturing figures provide further evidence that the government\u2019s long-term economic plan is working. Manufacturing has continued its strong growth and goods exports have hit a record high. But the job is not yet done, and as the IFS said only this week \u2018the largest challenge for the chancellor remains having to contend with the consequences of the Great Recession for the public finances and household incomes\u2019. That is why it\u2019s so important that we continue to work through the long-term plan that is delivering economic security for Britain\u2019s hardworking people.\u201d But Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics says today\u2019s data point to some rebalancing but it is by no means plain sailing from here. He comments: \u201cDecember\u2019s figures on industrial production and trade offer some mixed messages on whether the economy is achieving better balanced growth. On the one hand, momentum in industry may be easing. Given flat output in November, December\u2019s monthly rise of 0.3% in manufacturing output was fairly muted. And 0.4% growth in overall industrial production that month fell short of the 0.6% pencilled in by the ONS in its preliminary estimate of Q4 GDP growth. However, on its own, this is not enough to push down the estimated 0.7% rise in GDP in Q4. \u201cHowever, the trade data for December showed the UK\u2019s overall deficit in goods and services falling to an unexpectedly small \u00a31bn in December from \u00a33.6bn in the previous month. This was the biggest monthly narrowing since records began in 1998. Exports rose by 1.9% m/m while imports dropped by 4.7%. Note though that the latter was partly down to erratic factors, particularly a drop in imports of planes and ships. So the deficit is likely to widen again next month. Nonetheless, it looks like net trade will have added to growth in the final three months of 2014, following Q3\u2019s hefty drag. And Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF says: \u201cManufacturers had a strong finish to 2013, but more encouraging, are the indicators we\u2019ve seen since the start of the year which suggest that positive trend has rolled into the early part of 2014. Our expectation is that we see another quarter of 0.6% expansion in the three months to March, with a pretty even picture across sectors.\u201d Over in the FT, Richard Barwell, senior European economist at RBS, is also predicting that the European Court of Justice will, in time, rule in Mario Draghi\u2019s favour: He said: \u201cThe European Court was always the ultimate judge and jury of whether OMT is treaty compliant, so it makes sense for Karlsruhe to pass the buck for once, but I expect the ECJ to sing from the ECB\u2019s hymn sheet.\u201d So, it might be case of victory, deferred, for the European Central Bank. University of London European law expert Gunnar Beck reckons that the European Court of Justice is highly likely to rule in the European Central Bank\u2019s favour. He doesn\u2019t think it will share Germany\u2019s concern that the OMT bond-buying programme would effectively be monetising eurozone debts. Beck told Reuters that the ECJ will act in the best interest of the EU, rather than taking a strict legal view (!) \u201cPractically speaking, the Court of Justice is not an independent organization but is pre-disposed to interpret legal questions in the interest of the European Union. The court of justice doesn\u2019t take account of national sensibilities ... there is no doubt of the outcome now.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s why the Karlsruhe court decided to give the ECJ a bit of advice today, by declaring the bond-buying programme probably illegal unless it is only implemented in a restricted way (see here for details) Back to the German constitutional court\u2019s decision to ask the European Court of Justice to examine the ECB\u2019s OMT programme (see 9am onwards for full coverage). ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski argues that the news removes one short-term threat to the ECB, but adds that the ECJ may have its own concerns about the plan: The Court just said that there were \u201cimportant reasons to assume that it [the OMT programme] exceeds the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy mandate and thus infringes the powers of the Member States\u201d. In short, the Court gives a long explanation why it thinks that the OMT programme is illegal. However, there is one passage in the press statement which indicates that the Court is not totally convinced by its own assessment. According to the Court, OMT would be legal if it would not undermine the conditionality of the EFSF and ESM bailout programmes. This, however, in the eyes of the Court would require that the haircut option, which is part of the ESM treaty, should be excluded and that bond purchases are not unlimited. Particularly the issue of conditionality has frequently been emphasised by the ECB. It does not happen a lot that the German Constitutional Court passes sensitive decisions on to the European level. Today\u2019s announcement therefore could either be a sign that the Court has reached its legal limits on European issues or that the issue is so tricky and touchy that it is better to pass it on. As regards the short-term outlook, the announcement should clearly reduce the Karlsruhe fear factor for the ECB. But not entirely. It is not a given that the European Court of Justice will only rubber-stamp the OMT programme. Turning to the UK briefly, we\u2019ve had mixed economic data this morning. Official figures show Britain\u2019s trade deficit narrowed sharply at the end of last year but manufacturing failed to grow as strongly as hoped, reports my colleague Katie Allen: The Office for National Statistics said a rise in exports and a fall in imports helped the UK\u2019s deficit on trade in goods and services fall to an estimated \u00a31bn in December, compared with a deficit of \u00a33.6bn in November. Trade data are erratic but it is good news for the government as it continues to push for rebalancing of the UK economy towards more external demand. The goods deficit \u2013 easier to assess than trade in services \u2013 was \u00a37.7bn, down from \u00a39.8bn in November. That was well below a consensus forecast for a \u00a39.3bn gap in a Reuters poll of economists. The news on manufacturing, around a tenth of the UK economy, was less upbeat. The ONS said manufacturing production rose 0.3% on the month in December, half as fast as forecast. The wider industrial sector, which also includes mining and utilities, saw output rise 0.4%, below forecasts for 0.6% growth. Over the fourth quarter of 2013 both manufacturing and industrial production were weaker than the ONS had estimated when it came up with last month\u2019s growth figure for the economy as a whole of 0.7%. But it said the impact on that estimate was less than 0.05%. Megan Greene, chief economist at Maverick Intelligence, also reckons that the ECB won\u2019t be able to pull the trigger on OMT until the European judges have had their say: Mats Persson of Open Europe reckons the German court have kicked the OMT issue into the long grass, by referring it to the European Court of Justice. Sony Kapoor of the ReDefine think tank argues that today\u2019s ruling will make it harder for the ECB to activate the OMT bond-buying programme in the short term. But does that matter? The borrowing costs of Spain and Italy - two potential candidates for OMT help - have fallen sharply over the last 18 months since Mario Draghi announced the plan. They remain calm today -- Italy can borrow at around 3.7% per annum for 10 years, while Spain\u2019s 10-year bonds are trading at 3.6%. During the crisis, these bonds were trading at alarming yields of 7% or more. The FT\u2019s Brussels expert, Peter Spiegel, and ING\u2019s economist Carsten Brzeski, are both surprised that the German constitutional court could declare OMT probably illegal but refer the issue to the European court of justice: The German judges are also unimpressed by Mario Draghi\u2019s argument that the OMT bond-buying programme will address unwarranted fears that the eurozone might break up. They say it\u2019s a de facto economic policy (not allowed in the rules): The classification of the OMT Decision as an act of economic policy is supported by its immediate objective, which is to neutralise spreads on government bonds of selected Member States of the euro currency area. According to the European Central Bank, these spreads are partly based on fear of investors of a reversibility of the euro; however, according to the Bundesbank, such interest rate spreads only reflect the scepticism of market participants that individual Member States will show sufficient budgetary discipline to stay permanently solvent. Some eurocrisis experts point out that the European Court of Justice is unlikely to make an early ruling on the legality of the OMT programme - suggesting we might not get a ruling until 2016. The European Central Bank has swiftly declared that its OMT programme does not breach European rules, whatever those German judges say. Skimming today\u2019s statement from Germany, the constitutional court judges voted 6-2 that there are \u201cimportant reasons\u201d to assume that the OMT bond-buying programme would effectively be monetary financing -- in other words, one member state\u2019s budgets being financed by another. The Maastricht Treaty strictly forbids monetary financing. The judges say: In the view of the Senate, there are important reasons to assume that it exceeds the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy mandate and thus infringes the powers of the Member States, and that it violates the prohibition of monetary financing of the budget. adding: The violation would be manifest because primary law stipulates an explicit prohibition of monetary financing of the budget and thus unequivocally excludes such powers of the European Central Bank. However, they also suggest that OMT could still be legal if there is no reduction in a country\u2019s national debt, and if the ECB does not buy \u201cunlimited amounts\u201d, and if it doesn\u2019t unduly affect the financial markets. In the view of the Federal Constitutional Court, the OMT Decision might not be objectionable... [if] the acceptance of a debt cut must be excluded, that government bonds of selected Member States are not purchased up to unlimited amounts, and that interferences with price formation on the market are to be avoided where possible. This is the first time that Germany\u2019s constitutional court has referred a case to the European Court of Justice, flags up Nina Schick of Open Europe. There\u2019s no immediate panic in the markets. The euro only fell slightly - down around 0.2% against the US dollar. The statement from the German constitutional court, referring the ECB\u2019s OMT bond-buying programme to the European Court of Justice, is online here. Some important news out of Germany -- its constitutional court has declared that the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying programme may exceed its mandate, and referred it to European Court of Justice. Germany\u2019s highest court warned that the ECB\u2019s Outright Monetary Transaction programme could infringe the central bank\u2019s mandate -- although it might be acceptable if implemented in a limited way. Reuters has the quotes: The court said it sees \u201cimportant reasons to assume that it exceeds the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy mandate and thus infringes the powers of the member states, and that it violates the prohibition of monetary financing of the budget\u201d. However, the court said in a statement that it \u201calso considers it possible that if the OMT Decision were interpreted restrictively\u201d it could conform with law. Judges in Karlsruhe have been deliberating for months over OMT, with some analysts warning that it could jam a hefty spoke into the wheels of Mario Draghi\u2019s crisis-calming measures. Although OMT has never been activated, the pledge to buy unlimited quantities of eurozone government bonds if a country suffered borrowing problems helped calm the crisis 18 months ago. Only yesterday, Mario Draghi told reporters that the ECB had the power to buy government bonds in the so-called secondary debt market. More to follow.... London\u2019s property market remains pretty hot, according to Shaftesbury, the owner of property in London\u2018s Soho and other West End districts The company told the City this morning that demand was strong across properties in Carnaby Street, Chinatown, Charlotte Street and other West End \u201cvillages\u201d in the four months to 6 February. Existing sites are virtually fully let and businesses are snapping up refurbished properties as they come on the market. More here: London West End property owner says business remains strong An unexpected drop in exports has helped to trim Germany\u2019s trade surplus. The Federal Statistics Office reports that German exports fell 0.9% month-on-month in December, from \u20ac93.3bn to \u20ac92.5bn. Imports dipped 0.6%, from \u20ac74.4bn to \u20ac74bn. This meant the December trade balance came in at +\u20ac18.5bn, down from November\u2019s \u20ac18.9bn - but still rather higher than the \u20ac16.9bn recorded a year earlier. Not a great morning for pharmaceuticals firm Shire, though -- it\u2019s leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 1.6%, after telling shareholders last night its Vyvanse drug had failed two late-stage clinical trials to see if it worked as an anti-depression treatment (updated). European markets are also up in early trading -- adding to some strong gains yesterday. Nothing spectacular ; the Russian MICEX is the best performer, up 0.5%. Here\u2019s the details of the Asian rally overnight, led by Japan -- with the Nikkei up 2.1% rise and the broader Topix gaining 2.3%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the main events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The big event in the markets today is the US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, the monthly measure of employment in the world\u2019s largest economy, released at 1.30pm GMT. After December\u2019s surprisingly poor report (just 74,000 new jobs were created), economists are looking for a stronger reading today -- and some reckon last month\u2019s report could also be revised higher. It could also show the US jobless rate falling from last month\u2019s 6.7% -- though that can be a mixed blessing if it\u2019s simply due to workers quitting the labour force altogether. The NFP has global implication. A strong report will vindicate the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to reduce (or taper) its bond-buying stimulus programme -- sending spillover effects rippling through emerging markets). Another poor report could give Janet Yellen and the rest of the Fed something to ponder. Wall Street, and most European stock markets, rallied yesterday afternoon on hopes that today\u2019s reading will show the US economy healing -- and Asia has followed suit overnight. Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumped over 2%, while the Chinese Shanghai index rose a gentle 0.6% on the first day of trading after the Lunar New Year break. The consensus estimate is that NFP will how around 180,000 new jobs created in the US last month, although estimates do vary considerably (economists are struggling to work out how much disruption was caused by recent wintery weather) . While Stan Shamu of IG reckons the big question is how emerging markets respond to the data: Given tapering now seems to be on a set course, it is important to see US jobs stabilising to help underpin confidence. Eight out of the last nine payrolls releases have seen US equities gain ground and if that counts for anything we could be in for an extension of gains. It\u2019ll be important to watch emerging markets closely and how they react to the jobs numbers. In the meantime, the latest UK trade data (at 9.30am GMT) will show how Britain\u2019s economy performed in December. We\u2019ve already seen a surprise drop in German exports this morning (more in a moment). We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day as usual.",

      "bodyText": "For a while this week it looked as if February would follow January as a month to forget for the markets. Continuing concerns about problems in emerging markets, as the US Federal Reserve continued to trim its bond buying programme, sent leading shares lower again at the start of the week.

At the end of last month the commerce department announced that the US economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.2% in the last three months of 2013. Consumers and businesses appear to have largely ignored the government shutdown and fight over the debt ceiling last year that many economists worried would harm the economy. \u201cPayroll growth appears to have slowed but, given the strength of economic growth in the second half of last year, we expect to see a rebound in the monthly gains over the next few months,\u201d says Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.",

      "bodyText": "A threat by Germany to outlaw the European Central Bank's most effective financial backstop for crisis-hit eurozone countries has been suspended after judges referred the dispute to Europe's highest court. The German constitutional court said doubts about the ultimate effects of the policy had persuaded it to set aside fears that the ECB's plan went beyond its remit and could result in taxpayers in richer countries subsidising poorer states. Passing the decision to the European court of justice, the German judges said it may be possible for the ECB to give countries on the edge of bankruptcy funds through its outright monetary transactions (OMT) policy without breaching its rules. The European court is expected to rubber-stamp the policy. The policy, announced by ECB chief Mario Draghi in August 2012, allows the central bank to buy up unlimited amounts of the sovereign debt of crisis-ridden countries. While it has not so far been put into action, its mere existence has defused fears of an imminent break-up of the eurozone, and as such has proved the most effective tool in calming the crisis. Eighteen months ago the German court backed two other eurozone crisis tools \u2013 the \u20ac500m (\u00a3415m) European stability mechanism bailout fund and the European fiscal pact. Friday's move by the German court was widely seen as a way to dodge a decision that had become highly charged over the last year. The constitutional court had agreed to rule on the OMT under pressure from eurosceptics, who want to impose a German veto on \"under the counter\" ECB subsidies. Judges at the court, which is based in Karlsruhe, made an initial assessment backing the eurospectics and finding the OMT programme to be illegal \u2013 saying there were \"important reasons to assume that it [the OMT programme] exceeds the ECB's monetary policy mandate and thus infringes the powers of the member states\". However, the court has now said it was not completely convinced by its own assessment. It said the ECB could impose stringent requirements that offset the huge subsidies that flow from rescuing a member state from financial collapse. Carsten Brzeski, a eurozone analyst at Dutch bank ING, said: \"The announcement could either be a sign that the court has reached its legal limits on European issues or that the issue is so tricky and touchy that it is better to pass it on.\" In the short term, he said the announcement \"should clearly reduce the Karlsruhe fear factor for the ECB\". The German constitutional court said it would issue its final ruling on the \u20ac500m ESM on 18 March. But it also decided to consult the European court of justice with regard to the OMT because the ECB, as a European body, comes under the jurisdiction of the Luxembourg-based court. It would be the first time that the constitutional court has passed a case on to the European court.",

The improvement in the UK's trade position in December exceeded economists' expectations and raised hopes that exports finally helped boost the overall economy at the end of last year after dragging on growth over the summer.

Vince Cable previously dismissed these claims as 'froth' but now it is clear to see the government's priorities lie in topping up investors' profits at the expense of consumers and taxpayers.\" On Wednesday, Cameron refused to say the government got the best deal for the taxpayer. \"The government did a good job to get private sector capital into Royal Mail. Frankly, that is something that has evaded Governments of all colours and all persuasions for decades,\" he said during prime minister's questions in the Commons. The lowest valuation received by the government said Royal Mail could be worth between \u00a32.8bn and \u00a33.2bn. The highest attached a value of between \u00a36.9bn and \u00a38.7bn. JP Morgan told MPs in October that its early stage valuation was between \u00a36.8bn and \u00a38.5bn.",

    "webTitle": "Bombardier UK wins \u00a31bn Crossrail contract", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bombardier UK has fought off competition from foreign bidders to win the \u00a31bn contract to build trains for London's Crossrail project. Britain's only train builder, based in Derby, beat Japan's Hitachi and CAF of Spain to supply 65 trains for the line. Bombardier \u2013 the British arm of the Canadian aerospace and transport manufacturer \u2013 had warned that missing out on the contract could cause the factory, which employs 1,500 workers, to close. A second rail-related boost to the economy will get under way on Friday with the formal launch of a series of major rail upgrades radiating out from Manchester to cut journey times across the north. The \u00a3600m rail investment programme, billed as the Northern Hub, will see improvements including electrified track and new stretches of railway allowing faster connections between stations from Chester and Liverpool to Bradford and Leeds, cutting out some of the gridlock around Manchester Piccadilly. The chancellor, George Osborne, launched the construction project at Manchester airport station \u2013 one project in the five-year programme that the government claims will create up to 20,000 jobs. Network Rail estimates the wider economic benefit to the region will be worth \u00a34bn, as well as increasing railway capacity \u2013 potentially allowing 700 more trains daily, and cutting journey times. Osborne said: \"Because of the tough decisions we've taken on day-to-day spending, we're able to invest in key infrastructure projects like the Northern Hub, which will create billions for the region. \"This investment will ensure growth is not concentrated in any one place by keeping Britain connected and creating thousands of local jobs, delivering a brighter economic future for the whole country.\" The deal, which also includes building a new depot, will support 760 UK manufacturing jobs and 80 apprenticeships. It will keep an estimated 74% of the contract spend in the UK. Transport for London (TfL) and the Department for Transport announced the politically charged decision on Thursday morning. Bombardier missed out on the UK's last big train contract to build rolling stock for the upgrade to London's Thameslink network. The \u00a31.6bn commission went to Germany's Siemens in 2011, prompting Bombardier to cut 1,200 jobs at its plant. Following the uproar over the Thameslink contract, the government pledged to put British manufacturers on an \"equal footing\" with overseas competition but ministers remained constrained by European Union rules. Andrew Wolstenholme, chief executive of Crossrail, said: \"Crossrail will transform rail services in London and the south-east. Procurement of the rolling stock and depot is just one more step in delivering this new railway and making it a reality for millions of passengers. \"Crossrail Limited has conducted this procurement in a fair, objective and transparent manner and in full compliance with the regulatory framework.\" If the contract had gone to a foreign bidder it would have proved a severe embarrassment to the government and its efforts to encourage manufacturing. George Osborne declared a \"march of the makers\" in 2011 that was undermined by Siemens winning the Thameslink contract. The \u00a315bn Crossrail project will connect London's suburbs to the east and west, running through the centre of the city to increase rail capacity by 10%. London's already overcrowded transport system is set to face further demands as the population grows by an expected 1.6 million to 10 million over the next 15 years. Bombardier has promised that at least 25% of the value of the contract will go to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Business secretary Vince Cable has consistently called for more support for SMEs, which make up more than half the UK economy. TfL will start running the new trains from May 2017 on the existing rail network ahead of services starting on Crossrail's central section in December 2018. Cable said: \"As well as providing a great boost to Bombardier and the Midlands this decision represents a real vote of confidence in British manufacturing. The government has been working hard with industry to support the UK rail supply chain to maximise growth opportunities through contracts like this. Our industrial strategy is giving business the confidence to invest \u2013 securing high-skilled jobs and a stronger economy.\"",

Network Rail estimates the wider economic benefit to the region will be worth \u00a34bn, as well as increasing railway capacity \u2013 potentially allowing 700 more trains daily, and cutting journey times.</p> <p>Osborne said: \"Because of the tough decisions we've taken on day-to-day spending, we're able to invest in key infrastructure projects like the Northern Hub, which will create billions for the region.</p> <p>\"This investment will ensure growth is not concentrated in any one place by keeping Britain connected and creating thousands of local jobs, delivering a brighter economic future for the whole country.\"</p> <p>The deal, which also includes building a new depot, will support 760 UK manufacturing jobs and 80 apprenticeships. It will keep an estimated 74% of the contract spend in the UK.</p> <p>Transport for London (TfL) and the Department for Transport announced the politically charged decision on Thursday morning.</p> <p>Bombardier missed out on the UK's last big train contract to build rolling stock for the upgrade to London's Thameslink network. The \u00a31.6bn commission went to Germany's Siemens in 2011, prompting Bombardier to cut 1,200 jobs at its plant.</p> <p>Following the uproar over the Thameslink contract, the government pledged to put British manufacturers on an \"equal footing\" with overseas competition but ministers remained constrained by European Union rules.</p> <p>Andrew Wolstenholme, chief executive of Crossrail, said: \"Crossrail will transform rail services in London and the south-east. Procurement of the rolling stock and depot is just one more step in delivering this new railway and making it a reality for millions of passengers.</p> <p>\"Crossrail Limited has conducted this procurement in a fair, objective and transparent manner and in full compliance with the regulatory framework.\"</p> <p>If the contract had gone to a foreign bidder it would have proved a severe embarrassment to the government and its efforts to encourage manufacturing. George Osborne declared a \"march of the makers\" in 2011 that was undermined by Siemens winning the Thameslink contract.</p> <p>The \u00a315bn Crossrail project will connect London's suburbs to the east and west, running through the centre of the city to increase rail capacity by 10%. London's already overcrowded transport system is set to face further demands as the population grows by an expected 1.6 million to 10 million over the next 15 years.</p> <p>Bombardier has promised that at least 25% of the value of the contract will go to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Business secretary Vince Cable has consistently called for more support for SMEs, which make up more than half the UK economy.</p> <p>TfL will start running the new trains from May 2017 on the existing rail network ahead of services starting on Crossrail's central section in December 2018.</p> <p>Cable said: \"As well as providing a great boost to Bombardier and the Midlands this decision represents a real vote of confidence in British manufacturing. The government has been working hard with industry to support the UK rail supply chain to maximise growth opportunities through contracts like this. Our industrial strategy is giving business the confidence to invest \u2013 securing high-skilled jobs and a stronger economy.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britons will have to wait six more years before their inflation-adjusted wages are back at pre-crisis levels and it \"feels\" like recovery, a leading thinktank has warned. Average real wages are still at 2004 levels and it will take until 2020 before they return to their 2009 peak, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). \"It's a long way off,\" said Simon Kirby, principal research fellow at the thinktank. \"It will take a number of years before people actually start to feel the recovery.\" The gradual rise in wages could take even longer if Britain's productivity performance, which has been \"abysmal\" in recent years, did not improve, he said. NIESR's stark reminder of the continued squeeze in UK living standards came despite it upgrading its forecasts for growth in the broader economy. It said in its quarterly review that recovery appeared to be \"entrenched\" following annual growth of 1.9% in 2013. It is now expecting growth to accelerate to 2.5% in 2014, significantly higher than its November prediction for this year of 2%. The revised figure would put growth in Britain ahead of the average for the major developed nations among the members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. UK GDP is expected to return to its pre-crisis peak in the third quarter of this year, and NIESR forecasts growth of 2.1% in both 2015 and 2016. The main driver of the upwardly revised forecast is consumer spending, which is expected to rise by 3.4% this year \u2013 the biggest jump since 2003. NIESR put this down to an \"even more buoyant\" housing market than it had been predicting three months ago, propped up by government schemes such as Help to Buy.

NIESR said the domestically driven recovery would also be helped by business investment, which is expected to jump 9.6% this year as the rise in consumer spending makes companies more confident about the prospects for future demand. Exports are not expected to contribute to overall growth until 2016 as domestic demand for UK and imported goods outweighs foreign demand for UK goods. \"The hoped-for balanced recovery has yet to appear,\" Kirby said. \"In the near term, we expect the deficit on the UK's external trade balance to widen.\" NIESR said that the faster-than-expected fall in unemployment in Britain had been \"a welcome surprise\", but criticised the Bank of England's confusing message over forward guidance, under which the Bank said it would not consider raising interest rates until the unemployment rate has fallen to 7%.
