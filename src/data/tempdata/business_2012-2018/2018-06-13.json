      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve raised US interest rates again on Wednesday, the seventh increase since 2015 when the central bank resumed raising rates after the last recession. The Fed move came after a two-day meeting where its members discussed the robust state of the US economy and the potential impact of a trade war amid rising tension between the US and its largest trading partners. Announcing the decision to increase its target for the fed-funds rate to a range of 1.75% to 2%, the Fed described the US jobs market as \u201cstrong\u201d and said economic activity had been rising at \u201ca solid rate\u201d. At a press conference the Fed chair, Jay Powell, said that concerns over deteriorating trade relations were mounting among US executives but added: \u201cRight now we really don\u2019t see that in the numbers at all.\u201d US unemployment dropped to 3.8% in May, its lowest level since April 2000 and one of the lowest levels since the second world war. More increases are expected this year but the Fed noted \u201creadings on financial and international developments\u201d would factor into its decisions on future increases. The US has now added jobs every month for 92 consecutive months and wages, which have stagnated since the recession, have begun to rise moderately. At the same time stock markets remain close to record highs and inflation has accelerated. The labor department reported on Tuesday, just as the Fed was meeting, that the consumer price index had risen by 2.8% from a year earlier, the biggest annual gain since February 2012. The Fed\u2019s twin mandate is to bolster employment while controlling inflation, and in the current environment more rate rises appear inevitable. The Fed has indicated that it is likely to raise rates three or four more times this year. Against this background, however, Fed officials are closely watching the escalating tensions between the US, Canada, China, the EU and Mexico over trade. So far stock markets have shrugged off strong rhetoric from both sides about threats of retaliatory action following the Trump administration\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium. Last week\u2019s G7 summit of world leaders in Canada ended in acrimony after Trump officials said Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had \u201cstabbed us in the back\u201d after he told a press conference Canada would \u201cmove forward with retaliatory measures\u201d in response to the Trump administration\u2019s move to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel. As early as this week the Trump administration is expected to unveil $50bn worth of tariffs on Chinese goods \u2013 a move that Beijing has also warned will be met with retaliatory action.",

      "bodyText": "By WPP\u2019s standards, a 29.5% vote against the remuneration report almost counts as a decent result for the board. Back in 2012, the figure was 60%. In 2016, when the former chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell scooped his \u00a370m, it was 34%. This time the issue was how on earth Sorrell could be entitled to up to \u00a320m-worth of share awards after departing in circumstances WPP refuses to explain, citing legal restrictions. So, yes, the chairman, Roberto Quarta, will be relieved. A 30%-ish protest, on a resolution that would have obliged WPP to do nothing formally anyway, is not so bad for him. Quarta did, though, offer a glimpse into life inside the boardroom in recent years. It almost sounded as if the directors have done little else but dance around Sorrell\u2019s sensitivities over pay and perks. Pay, said Quarta after Wednesday\u2019s shareholder meeting, was \u201cthe most important thing on the agenda from shareholders\u201d when he became chairman in 2015. There had already been one downwards adjustment to Sorrell\u2019s rewards and the \u201cspousal travel allowance\u201d had been cut. Quarta was now expected to deliver another reduction in rewards while \u201cwanting to ensure Martin did not throw his toys out of the pram\u201d, as he put it. The task is semi-achieved but the effort seems to have exhausted the board. As Quarta admitted, WPP never got round to asking Sorrell to sign a conventional employment contract in place of the unorthodox \u201cat will\u201d arrangement that had somehow survived from 2008. Critically, the absence of a non-compete clause has allowed the founder to found a rival startup within two months of departing \u2013 something that may or may not become a medium-term headache for WPP. The company can insist Sorrell respects confidentiality clauses, but obviously cannot control clients\u2019 choice of agency. The contract was \u201csomething we were working on\u201d, said Quarta, weakly. Working on \u2013 or trying to summon the courage? Questions remain for FRC The Financial Reporting Council, the audit watchdog, has seemingly awoken from its slumbers. This month it gave itself new powers to increase penalties against big auditing firms, and now it has used them. PricewaterhouseCoopers has been hit for a record \u00a36.5m for its work on the accounts of BHS and Taveta Group, and Steve Denison, the relevant PwC partner, is facing a 15-year ban from the audit industry. Everybody happy? Of course not. The need for the \u201croot and branch\u201d review of the FRC that is currently being conducted by Sir John Kingman, the chair of the insurer Legal &amp; General, looks as clear as ever \u2013 and not just to address the suspicion that the FRC is too close to the firms it regulates. The PwC-BHS case does not answer the separate criticism about the speed at which the FRC works. The BHS accounts under the microscope were for 2014 and FRC took two years to get from opening its investigation to concluding it, despite PwC making a \u201cvery early admission\u201d of serious shortcomings. Nor has the watchdog explained how it reached its decision. Nor do we know if the FRC\u2019s idea of a big fine is sufficient to serve as real encouragement to better standards. The effective ban on Denison carrying out audit work will sting the individual, but the \u00a36.5m penalty on PwC is equivalent to a mere 0.8% of its UK profits last year of \u00a3822m. PwC notes that the audit failings did not contribute to BHS\u2019s collapse a year later. On the other hand, it confesses its audit methodology \u201csimply was not followed\u201d and it is being told by the FRC to do what sounds like basic stuff: ensure that the checking process for \u201chigh-risk or high-profile\u201d private businesses matches the one that applies to listed companies. Why didn\u2019t the FRC insist on such a process previously? There remains much for Kingman to chew on. Soames does his sums Rule one for bosses appearing in front of select committees is to be prepared to be asked about your pay packet. It\u2019s amazing how many arrive unprepared and thus look evasive. The rule applies doubly when the committee is the public accounts committee, which is usually dealing with matters relating to public money, in this case the government\u2019s approach to outsourcing. Rupert Soames, the chief executive of Serco, showed how to do it on Wednesday. He flourished his P60 and read the figures: \u201cLast year I was paid \u00a32,312,174 on which I paid tax of \u00a31,037,851.\u201d Chief executives take note: candour is not hard and the effect was disarming.",

    "webTitle": "WPP chairman defends handling of Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s departure", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chair of WPP has defended the handling of Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s exit and insisted the world\u2019s largest advertising group was powerless to stop its founder from walking away with share bonuses worth up to \u00a320m. Roberto Quarta told shareholders at the group\u2019s annual general meeting on Wednesday there was \u201cno basis\u201d to cancel Sorrell\u2019s share awards because the company had no proof of misconduct \u2013 despite a series of allegations against the former chief executive. He said: \u201cThe contract ... required Martin to be treated as having retired unless a definition of gross misconduct would be satisfied, which it could not, and on which the board had clear legal advice.\u201d However, investors registered their discontent as nearly 30% of them refused to support the company\u2019s remuneration report. While Quarta brushed off a modest vote against his own reappointment, several shareholders criticised incentive plans that allow Sorrell to keep earning even after a departure that took place against a backdrop of lurid allegations. Sorrell resigned in April, in the wake of a company probe into his conduct and alleged misuse of company funds, which has not been established. However, claims over the background to the probe emerged this week, with claims that he bullied staff and was seen by two employees entering a sex worker\u2019s premises in a London red light district. He strenuously denies the allegations. The 73-year-old advertising tycoon, who has picked up \u00a3200m in pay and bonuses over five years, could still receive a further \u00a320m in awards, leading one investor at the AGM to demand that his replacement is not handed \u201cobscene\u201d levels of remuneration. Quarta also defended the company\u2019s failure to redraw Sorrell\u2019s contract, signed in 2008, that contained an \u201cat-will\u201d clause allowing him to leave at any time and still pick up a retirement payoff. The contract also did not include a \u201cnon-compete\u201d clause, an omission that has cleared the way for Sorrell to set up a new venture, called S4, which some shareholders said they feared would now compete with WPP. Speaking on the sidelines of the meeting, Quarta said his priority after arriving in 2015 had been to reduce Sorrell\u2019s vast pay package, which reached \u00a370m in 2016. \u201cThe sensitivity I was hearing from shareholders was wanting to address the issue of pay, but at the same time wanting to ensure that Martin did not throw his toys out of the pram, so to speak,\u201d said Quarta. He said he had hoped to renegotiate the contract but had not got round to raising the matter with Sorrell by the time whistleblowers had triggered an internal conduct investigation, carried out by the US law firm WilmerHale. Quarta added that he was confident that Sorrell, who has said his new venture is a \u201cpeanut\u201d compared to WPP, would not seek to compete with the business he built. \u201cWe\u2019re watching to see what Martin will do,\u201d said Quarta. \u201cWe are entitled to challenge any individual who may breach his or her confidentiality. Martin I don\u2019t think needs to be reminded of his responsibilities and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll act appropriately.\u201d Mark Read, the joint chief operating officer tipped as a potential successor to Sorrell, launched a review of company rules on conduct earlier this week, after allegations emerged that Sorrell created a \u201cfear culture\u201d by bullying staff. \u201cMartin was a hard-working and hard-driving chief executive. I don\u2019t recognise ... the bullying nature of some of the allegations,\u201d Read said after the meeting. Quarta is understood to have started an investigation into how information about allegations against Sorrell has leaked into the media. Read and Quarta both insisted that the \u00a315.4bn company, which is the subject of break-up speculation, could continue in its current form regardless of Sorrell\u2019s departure. WPP houses several leading advertising agencies including Ogilvy &amp; Mather and JWT as well as the media-buying business GroupM. \u201cIn spite of all the credit one needs to give to Martin [...], no one man is the company,\u201d said Quarta. \u201cIt\u2019s been much publicised that this company without Martin won\u2019t survive but if you look at the history that\u2019s not the case.\u201d He said the company was moving quickly to find a new boss but was unlikely to appoint anyone before the end of the month. Read, believed to be leading internal candidate, indicated that company\u2019s next chief executive would have to adopt a more co-operative style. \u201cCan one man run the company? Nobody can run it like he did,\u201d he said. Earlier in the meeting, the board fielded a succession of questions from investors, particularly about future pay arrangements. Quarta said the new chief executive\u2019s bonuses would be capped at eight times basic salary, indicating a total annual package worth a maximum of around \u00a310m, based on current remuneration arrangements. One investor shouted that this was \u201ctoo high\u201d, although the last time Sorrell was paid that little was in 2009.",

      "bodyText": "The latest housing finance figures from the Bureau of Statistics released on Tuesday show that investors continue to flee the housing market, but owner-occupiers are also taking out fewer mortgages than they were a year ago. Even with interest rates at, or near, record lows, right now the decision to buy or invest in property is being put off. Real estate, perhaps more than any other industry, is subject to peaks and troughs. And right now it is in a trough. In April, for a record 15th month straight, the value of mortgages taken out by investors fell in trend terms. The 2% fall in April was the biggest monthly fall in that period, suggesting that there is still some ways to go before the bottom is reached. Combined with a 0.2% fall in the value of owner-occupier mortgages (excluding re-financing) it adds up to a 1% fall in total housing finance \u2013 the ninth consecutive fall, the longest run since the global financial crisis. Total housing finance in April was 5% below what it was a year ago \u2013 led by a 13% fall in investor financing, while the 2.1% growth in owner occupier finance was the weakest since 2016: In short, people are staying out of the housing market \u2013 and mostly this is coming from investors. The sharp drop in investor finance is most obvious when you look at the total value of mortgages taken out each month. In 2015, the level of investment finance actually surprised that of owner occupiers. And even though it dipped once macroprudential rules were put in place to limit banks\u2019 exposure to such speculative lending, by the end of 2016, investor and owner-occupier lending was almost equal. Since then the level of investor finance has fallen by 16% while the value of owner occupier lending has grown by 8%: Essentially, investing in housing isn\u2019t seen as that great of an investment at the moment. But while investment property has been the big story, it would be wrong to think that owner-occupiers are now rushing into the market. While the value of mortgages taken out by owner-occupiers grew over the past year, the number of such mortgages has actually fallen: The number of people taking out mortgages to buy a home has now been falling for eight months in trend terms. And the pace of the drop has been quite fast \u2013 down 8% in that time. The fall is pretty uniform across the nation as well. In all states the annual growth in the number of owner-occupier mortgages being taken out is lower than it was in September last year: One area however where things appear to be improving is for first-home buyers. In April, 17.6% of owner-occupiers taking out a mortgage were first-home buyers \u2013 down slightly on the month, but still well above where it was a year ago: But here, however, a bit of care needs to be taken before cracking open the champagne and declaring the problems of housing affordability for young buyers is over. Overwhelmingly, the increase in first-home buyers comes from Victoria and New South Wales, where last year the respective state governments brought in policies to encourage first-home buyers such as cutting stamp duty and, in Victoria, doubling the first-home buyers grant for homes in regional areas: But while the figures appear to show a strong surge, in reality the surge was a very quick one in the month the new policies came into effect, and since then it has tapered off quite dramatically: It would seem that, even with the incentive, getting into the housing market for first home buyers remains tough. After all, despite the slowing of the housing market, the average mortgage size has continued to grow: Even in Sydney, where the market has come off the biggest peak, the average mortgage size in April was 7% higher than it was a year ago. Even using the less volatile rolling 12-month average, the average mortgage is still 3.8% higher than it was a year ago: So while housing affordability is perhaps not decreasing as quickly as it was two years ago, it remains a tough market to get into. The housing data suggests that for many investors, the difficulty is not worth the risk given the prospect of poor returns owing to low rental price growth and the already high house prices. And for those looking to a buy a home for themselves, it appears many are holding off, perhaps in the expectation that this slowing of the market will lead to a fall in house prices, or perhaps because while prices might be cooling now, after nearly five years of running hot while wages growth has been falling, the damage has already been done.

      "bodyText": "MPs have called on the accountancy regulator to consider investigating PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 auditing of Sir Philip Green\u2019s wider retail empire, after the firm was hit with a record fine over the handling of BHS under his ownership. The Financial Reporting Council confirmed late on Tuesday that PwC had been handed a record \u00a36.5m fine, reduced from \u00a310m after it agreed to settle and admitted misconduct. Steve Denison, one of the firm\u2019s senior accountants who audited BHS\u2019s accounts ahead of its sale for \u00a31 a year before the department store chain collapsed, is separately facing a 15-year ban and record personal fine of \u00a3325,000 from the industry watchdog. The fine was reduced from \u00a3500,000 after Denison admitted misconduct. The Commons work and pensions committee, which carried out an investigation into the demise of the department store in 2016, is pressing the FRC on whether further investigation and wider sanctions are called for. It has asked whether the FRC will investigate PwC\u2019s audit of the accounts of Taveta, the Sir Philip Green-led former parent company of BHS that sold the department store to the former bankrupt Dominic Chappell in 2015. Taveta controls Arcadia Group, which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton. Frank Field MP, the chair of the committee, said of the FRC\u2019s sanctions of PwC and Denison: \u201cThis is undoubtedly a good first move. It reopens the key question of whether BHS was in fact a \u2018going concern\u2019 when it was jettisoned for \u00a31. For that, the company directors as well as the auditors are on the hook.\u201d The committee has also asked for further details of the misconduct of PwC and Denison that earned them the fines, and of whether there was a conflict of interest in the advisory firm auditing the accounts of BHS and the parent company that was trying to offload it. The regulator said that in addition to the financial sanctions and a \u201csevere reprimand\u201d it has asked PwC to monitor its Leeds-based audit practice and provide detailed reports to the FRC for the next three years, while ensuring that all audits of high-risk non-listed companies or high-profile companies are reviewed for quality.",

The Irish airline expects to carry around a million passengers a year from the Essex airport, largely to Spain and Italy.

O\u2019Brien said disruption from European air traffic control strikes, primarily in France, could be the \u201cworst ever\u201d for airlines, which cancelled 1,100 flights in May. \u201cYour tourist going from Britain down to Spain is screwed by a couple of hundred French air traffic controllers,\u201d he said.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A branch of GCHQ, Britain\u2019s intelligence and security service, is investigating one of the UK\u2019s biggest data breaches at a single firm, involving unauthorised access to 5.9 million Dixons Carphone customers\u2019 cards. The National Cyber Security Centre said it was working alongside the retailer and other agencies after the attack, which also involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records of Dixons Carphone customers. \u201cAnyone concerned about fraud or lost data should contact Action Fraud and we recommend that people are vigilant against any suspicious activity on their bank accounts,\u201d the NCSC said. Dixons Carphone said it had identified the massive data breach while it was reviewing its systems and data. The consumer electronics firm said there was an attempt to compromise the cards in a processing system at Currys PC World and Dixons Travel, but said there was no evidence of fraud as a result of the incident. In a second breach, personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses have been accessed. Again, Dixons said there was no evidence that it had resulted in fraud. Alex Baldock, its chief executive, apologised for the data breach and admitted the company had failed its customers. \u201cWe are extremely disappointed and sorry for any upset this may cause. The protection of our data has to be at the heart of our business and we\u2019ve fallen short here. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken action to close off this unauthorised access and though we have currently no evidence of fraud as a result of these incidents, we are taking this extremely seriously.\u201d Baldock said the company had engaged cybersecurity experts to handle the matter and had added extra security measures to its systems. The retailer will be writing over the coming days to those customers whose personal data was breached, \u201cto inform them, to apologise, and to give them advice on any protective steps they should take\u201d. Of the 5.9m cards that were accessed illegally, 5.8m were chip and pin protected, and no pin codes, card verification values (CVV) or authentication data were accessed, meaning purchases could not be made. However, about 105,000 payment cards from outside the EU and without chip and pin protection were accessed. The retailer said it had notified the banks concerned and they had not detected any fraudulent purchases on customer accounts. Shares in Dixons Carphone fell as much as 6% at one point on Wednesday after the data breach was announced, as investors factored in a potentially steep fine for the company, as well as potential damage to the firm\u2019s reputation. The retailer said that while the data breach was only discovered over the past week, it occurred within the last year, before 25 May when the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules came into force. Under the previous Data Protection Act rules, the maximum fine imposed would be \u00a3500,000. Under the GDPR rules, firms could face a maximum of \u20ac20m (\u00a317.6m) or 4% of global turnover, whichever is the greater. The independent regulator, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, said it was investigating the breach alongside the NCSC and the Financial Conduct Authority. A spokesman for the ICO said the investigation was at an early stage. He added: \u201cWe will look at when the incident happened and when it was discovered as part of our work, and this will inform whether it is dealt with under the 1998 or 2018 Data Protection Acts.\u201d Alex Neill, a managing director at the consumer group Which?, said the security breach was a major concern. \u201cThis massive breach will cause real worry to millions of customers and raises serious questions about how Dixons Carphone has been looking after customers\u2019 data. It is critical the company moves quickly to ensure those affected get clear information about what has happened and what steps they should take to protect themselves. \u201cAnyone concerned they could be at risk of fraud should consider changing their online passwords, monitor bank and other online accounts and be wary of emails regarding the breach as scammers may try and take advantage of it.\u201d Dixons Carphone said its investigation into the cyber-attack had yet to identify the culprit or culprits. The retailer has informed the police and other relevant authorities.",

    "webTitle": "WPP shareholders revolt over pay following Sir Martin Sorrell's departure - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap, as shareholders stream home: Advertising giant WPP has faced irate investors at its AGM, two months after CEO Sir Martin Sorrell suddenly quit amid allegations of improper conduct. Nearly 30% of investors failed to back WPP\u2019s remuneration report -- a tried and trusted method for City bigwigs to chastise errant company boards. There was also a smaller protest at chairman Roberto Quarta, with 17% of investors declining to approve his re-election to the board. WPP may judge that this could have been worse; the company is no stranger to pay revolts, thanks to the whopping awards handed to Sorrell in former years. Sorrell\u2019s shock departure, and subsequent allegations of paying sex workers in petty cash and bullying junior WPP staff, loomed over the AGM at London\u2019s South Bank. Quarta defended WPP\u2019s handling of the issue, saying Sorrell was treated like any other colleague when allegations were first made. Quarta insisted that data protection rules simply prevented WPP saying any more about the issue. In an attempt to shut discussions down, Quarta declared: I know that questions remain, but there is really and simply nothing further we can legally disclose.\u201d He also defended WPP\u2019s decision to allow Sorrell to leave with stock options worth around \u00a320m. The company\u2019s legal advice was that Sorrell could only lose the awards if he was guilty of \u2018gross misconduct\u2019. Quarta also suggested that WPP understands it has a problem; the company has now launched a review of its policies. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect, he declared -- which really ought to go without saying... Shareholders at the packed AGM appeared split. One suggested that Sorrell deserved to lose the money because he was setting up a potential rival to WPP (S4). But another small investor claimed that the allegations facing Sorrell (which he denies!)were \u201centirely immaterial\u201d [reminder, the FT claims he was spotted visiting a Mayfair brothel, and gave some junior staff a thoroughly miserable time]. Shareholders also challenged WPP over its pay scheme -- there was anger that the next CEO\u2019s bonus could be eight times their basic pay. The company was also criticised for launching a share buyback scheme, as the share prices has fallen sharply in the last year. CO-COO Mark Read also looked to the future, saying WPP could survive without its founder, and needed a new \u2018beating heart\u201d. Chief transformation officer Lindsay Pattison says there are plenty of suitable internal candidates: Here\u2019s our news story on the AGM: That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW WPP shareholders have had their say, so we\u2019re onto voting on this year\u2019s resolutions. Of course, we already know that nearly 30% investors have rebelled over the pay report - as WPP released the \u2018proxy\u2019 votes at the start of the AGM. The final voting numbers could be slightly different, and will be released this afternoon. That\u2019s the end of the AGM. Shareholders are heading for refreshments, and reporters are trying to grab a word with the WPP top brass.... Another WPP investor asks an excellent question about WPP\u2019s share buyback scheme Q: How much cheaper would it be to have bought last year\u2019s shares this year? Finance director Paul Richardson says WPP could have saved $150m, or \u00a3100m! That\u2019s because it paid between \u00a315 and \u00a316 per share. Today, shares are only worth \u00a312.60. Another shareholder has spotted that WPP\u2019s annual report mentions a cyber attack. What happened, and what was the damage? COO Mark Read says WPP fell victim to a cyber attack in June 2017, which initiated in Ukraine. Read says WPP acted quickly by shutting down computer systems to prevent the virus infecting the whole company. WPP was unable to quantify the impact, but reckons it lose between \u00a3100m and \u00a3150m of revenue (although some may have been clawed back in subsequent months). Read says it was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for WPP, and argues that the company did \u201cremarkable well\u201d under the circumstances. I think this is the \u2018Petya\u2019 ransomware attack, which hit companies across the world last summer. Another shareholder asks about the pay on offer to WPP\u2019s next CEO under its new share incentive scheme. Apparently s/he can earn up to eight times basic pay, if all performance targets are hit. Shareholders aren\u2019t happy! One shouts out that this is excessive. Quarta has defended his position as chairman of two FTSE 100 companies (he also chairs medical group Smith &amp; Nephew). Quarta says he can definitely act as non-executive chairman of both (he\u2019s currently filling an executive role at WPP) Q: Do you accept that succession planning at WPP was inadequate? Chairman Quarta says the company had made some preparations for life after Sorrell, but it simply didn\u2019t have \u201cvisibility\u201d on when its founder and CEO might step down. Obviously it didn\u2019t expect the events of recent weeks. But once Sorrell quit, WPP moved from \u201cdesktop planning to a pro-active period\u201d. [WPP executives Mark Read and Andrew Scott are currently sharing the COO role]. Q: Are the obscene remunerations paid by WPP in previous years now a thing of the past? Quarta says WPP recently approved a new remuneration policy, which will determine what the next CEO is paid [back in 2016, Sorrell picked up \u00a370m] Q: Would Sorrell still have been granted \u2018good leaver status\u2019, if the board had been aware of the revelations about his (alleged) use of company money? Chair Roberto Quarta says he isn\u2019t in a position to comment. Q: How will WPP cope without Sorrell? COO Mark Read says Sorrell did a great job turning WPP into an advertising giant, but he thinks the business can succeed without him. Read says WPP needs a new beating heart, who can make the company a place where men and women across the world want to work at [another hint that the company\u2019s culture must change] One private shareholder criticises Roberto Quatra for not opening the AGM with a tribute to Sir Martin Sorrell. He\u2019s disappointed that Sorrell has quit over \u201chighly immaterial issues\u201d (!!), and is happy that he has held onto his LTPI share awards. He hopes that the former CEO enjoys a happy retirement, rather than turning his new company into a large peanut and fires it into \u201cthe rump of the WPP elephant\u201d. A few shareholders applaud in support. After a brief discussion about advertising strategy, another shareholder brings the AGM back to the issue of its former CEO: Q: Surely it is gross misconduct for Sorrell to launch a competitor? Can\u2019t we pull the plug on his stock options now? Chairman Roberto Quarta thinks not. He says Sorrell has described his new venture, S4, as a \u2018peanut\u2019, that couldn\u2019t compete against a giant like WPP. Quarta adds that WPP has \u201cconfidentiality clauses\u201d, and he\u2019s sure that Sorrell wouldn\u2019t want to jeopardise his share options by breaching them. The pay revolt at WPP is big, but it could have been bigger... Here\u2019s some instant reaction: Onto shareholder questions. The first comes from Hermes Equity Ownership Services, who say WPP\u2019s board has become \u201cmore effective\u201d since Roberto Quarta became chairman in 2015. But Hermes are still unhappy about the lack of transparency around WPP\u2019s pay arrangements (which resulted in Sorrell leaving with \u00a320m of options) Q: What will be the priorities for the new CEO? Quarta says Sorrell\u2019s successor must provide strong leadership, a good grasp of technology, and have great client skills. Boom! Nearly 30% of WPP shareholders have failed to approve this year\u2019s pay report. That\u2019s a bloody nose for the advertising giant, as investors show their displeasure over the \u00a319m of share options which Sir Martin Sorrell left with. Including abstentions, just 70.5% of investors voted to approve the remuneration report, with 29.5% failing to back it. There\u2019s also a smaller rebellion against the chairman, with only 83% of investors voting in favour of Roberto Quarta\u2019s re-election. WPP COO Mark Read is now speaking about the business now, saying the company hopes to do well at the Cannes Lions festival next week. Read also touches on the challenges facing the group, with data and technology are increasingly part of the future. Read also touches on the cultural issues at WPP, saying: We need an inclusive culture for our people. That is what is most critical to us. Chairman Quarta tries to direct shareholders\u2019 attention to the future, saying that the process of appointing a new CEO is well advanced. Chairman Roberto Quarta now turns to the allegations of workplace bullying published by the FT this week. Everyone is entitled to be \u201ctreated with respect\u201d, Quarta says. Everyone at WPP should feel able to raise concerns and to have them listened and acted upon. We take this very seriously, and have asked the new management team to review how policies are put into practice, and to identify where improvements are needed. Quarta now turns to the \u00a319m of stock options which Sir Martin Sorrell left with in April. WPP received \u201cvery clear\u201d legal advice that there was no basis to cancelling Sorrell\u2019s entitlement to shares which were due to vest in the next five years, Quarta says. He accepts that some shareholders find the share award scheme unsatisfactory. The only way Sorrell could have lost the awards were if \u201cgross misconduct\u201d could be established, Quarta continues, and the board had received very clear legal advice that it could not. Quarta turns to the resignation of Sir Martin Sorrell, following an allegation of personal misconduct. He says WPP took a \u201crobust\u201d approach to the allegations, treating him \u201cjust like any other employee would have been treated\u201d. We confirmed that the matter was wholly financially immaterial to WPP, says Quarta. We understand that some people would like more details, but data protection law prohibits us from releasing more information, he insists. Quarta continues: We take this responsibility very very seriously indeed... There is really and simply nothing we can legally disclose. WPP chairman Roberto Quarta is opening the AGM now, introducing the board. Quarta says the clients he has met in recent weeks \u201crecognise the quality of the talent that WPP have across the globe.\u201d I want to take this opportunity to thank the many thousands of talented people who make up WPP and drive its success, Quarta adds. The AGM is getting underway now. No sign of the WPP\u2019s most famous shareholder yet, though.... WPP have just released a trading statement to the City, ahead of the AGM. It shows that revenues are down in the first few months of this year, although they\u2019re actually up if you strip out currency moves. Reported revenue for first four months down 3.4% at \u00a34.822 billion, currency headwinds of 6.1% resulting in constant currency revenue up 2.7% at $6.633 billion, like-for-like revenue up 1.4% Reported revenue less pass-through costs down 5.0% at \u00a33.969 billion, currency headwinds of 6.1% resulting in constant currency up 1.1%, like-for-like revenue less pass-through costs up marginally Constant currency net debt at 30 April 2018 up \u00a366 million on same date in 2017, down significantly compared with the first quarter, with average net debt in first four months of 2018 up by \u00a3360 million over same period in 2017, similar to first quarter The Financial Times piled fresh pressure on Martin Sorrell and WPP earlier this week, when it published an investigation into his departure. The FT alleged that: Two employees saw him entering a premises in London\u2019s Shepherd Market, Mayfair, that is occupied by sex workers for the purposes of their trade. That WPP staff were concerned he may have used company funds to pay for the alleged visit, after previously having concerns about his use of expenses. Sorrell had a reputation for bullying his executive assistants and had created a fear culture at the company\u2019s headquarters. Staff feared he was misusing company resources for himself and his wife Cristiana. He sacked his long-serving chauffeur on the spot after the driver refused to start work at 7am, five hours after driving Cristiana home. Sir Martin\u2019s representatives have strenuously denied allegations of misconduct, saying that the non-disclosure agreement which Sorrell signed prevents him from saying more. WPP shareholders will push the board about the allegations of workplace bullying levelled against Sorrell in recent days. Is there a cultural problem at the heart of the ad giant? They will also want to know why the ex-CEO is still getting share awards worth millions, and why WPP has botched the succession plan so badly. The failure to tie Sorrell down with a non-compete clause looks like another blunder --- allowing him to launch a new company that could compete with WPP. WPP shareholders are massing at London\u2019s Southbank, for today\u2019s annual general meeting. As explained earlier, the world\u2019s largest advertising company faces heavy criticism from investors over the recent shock exit of founder Sir Martin Sorrell, and the cloak of secrecy which the firm has tried to throw over the issue. Some shareholders are certain to vote against WPP\u2019s pay policy, in protest at the decision to allow Sorrell to leave with future share awards worth up to \u00a320m. Chairman Roberto Quarta is also in the firing line over his handling of the crisis. My colleague Rob Davies predicts a \u201cchastening showdown with investors\u201d. WPP has been embarrassed by a string of allegations \u2013 strenuously denied by Sorrell \u2013 that have leaked into the public domain about the advertising and marketing guru\u2019s behaviour. Claims have emerged that WPP staff said they witnessed the 73-year-old entering a premises used by sex workers, leading to concerns that the alleged visit was paid for with company money. Rob is outside the AGM now, and reports that security guards are preventing photographers from snapping away: The AGM is due to start at noon. Gig economy news: A heating engineer has won his claim against Pimlico Plumbers, establishing that he was a worker and not self-employed. It\u2019s an important ruling by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court, which establishes that Gary Smith is entitled to various benefits including holiday pay. Pimlico Plumbers had argued (unsuccessfully) that Smith was self-employed - even though he was wearing their uniform, drove around in a van with \u201cPimlico Plumbers\u201d on the side, and had a contract saying he could be \u2018dismissed\u2019. The ruling could encourage more of Britain\u2019s gig economy workers to challenge their employers. Peter Dowd MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, points out that inflation is still running over the government\u2019s target - and eating into pay packets. Dowd is calling for more help for workers, especially those earning the minimum wage: \u201cThis is the sixteenth consecutive month in which inflation remains higher than the Bank of England\u2019s target, and working people are still struggling with real earnings continuing to be lower than in 2010, following eight years of Tory economic failure. Yet the Government refuses to act in any meaningful way. \u201cThe next Labour government will introduce a \u00a310 per hour Real Living Wage to tackle the squeeze on wages, and build a high wage, high skill economy for the many, not the few.\u201d We have fresh evidence that London\u2019s housing market is cooling. Private rental costs in the capital have fallen over the last year, by 0.2%. That\u2019s the first annual decline since September 2010, after Britain plunged into recession. Across the country as a whole, rents rose by 1% in the last year -- lagging behind pay rises and the wider inflation rate. But in the East Midlands, tenants are being charged 2.9% more than a year ago, followed by the South West and the East of England (both 2.0%). The jump in transport costs is a blow to anyone planning a trip abroad. Martin Lane, Managing Editor of money.co.uk, explains: \u201cThe rising cost of fuel prices has really taken its toll on our finances and had one of the biggest impacts on keeping inflation put. The cost of air and sea fares being on the rise month on month \u2013 not great for those looking to book a last minute summer holiday. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), predicts that inflation could rise in the coming months - but probably not for long. \u201cIt is possible that inflation may start to drift upwards in the coming months as the recent spike in oil prices filters through supply chains and into higher consumer prices. However, any pick-up in inflation would be relatively short-lived, with price growth likely to resume its downward path later in the year as the pressure from oil prices eases. UK households should be relieved that inflation isn\u2019t higher. City economists had expected CPI to rise to 2.5% last month, meaning inflation would be taking an even bigger chunk of our pay packets (reminder, basic pay grew by 2.8% over the last year). Weaker inflation also gives the Bank of England less reason to raise interest rates. Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, thinks the BoE has missed the opportunity to raise interest rates this year. With UK CPI stuck at 2.4% despite rising petrol prices and higher airfares, the release confirms the underlying weakness of the UK economy. Today\u2019s data follows yesterday\u2019s lower than expected wage growth and Monday\u2019s weak manufacturing data. Computer game prices fell in May, helping to keep inflation down. The ONS explains: Prices for these games are heavily dependent on the composition of bestseller charts, often resulting in large overall price changes from month to month. The ONS adds that \u201csugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery\u201d prices also dropped during the month. Vegetable prices rose, though. Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation, says fuel prices are the main driver of inflation right now: Mel Stride MP, financial secretary to the Treasury, has responded to the inflation data: \u201cSince last year inflation has fallen from its 3.1% peak but we recognise the cost of living is still a challenge for some families. \u201cThat is why we are freezing fuel duty at the pumps, cutting income taxes for 31 million people and increasing the National Living Wage.\u201d Today\u2019s inflation report also shows that Britain\u2019s drivers are suffering higher prices at the pumps. Petrol prices hit a three and a half-year high last month, as motorists faced the impact of higher crude oil. The Office for National Statistics says: Petrol prices rose by 4.6 pence per litre between April and May 2018 to stand at 125.3 pence per litre in May, the highest average price since October 2014. This compares with a 1.0 pence per litre fall between the same two months of 2017 to stand at 116.4 pence per litre in May 2017. Similarly, diesel prices rose by 4.7 pence per litre between April and May 2018 compared with a 1.6 pence per litre fall between the same two months a year ago. These recent rises reflect increases in the price of crude oil. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s inflation rate was unchanged at a one-year low last month, despite the pressure from higher energy prices. The Consumer Prices Index rose by 2.4% in May, matching April\u2019s rate. Inflation hasn\u2019t been lower since March 2017. The ONS says: Rising motor fuel prices produced the largest upward contribution There were also large upward effects from air and sea fares, which rose between April and May this year but fell between the same two months a year ago, influenced by the timing of Easter. Partially offsetting downward effects came from price changes for games, domestic electricity, food and non-alcoholic beverages, and furniture and furnishings. More to follow.... As a WPP shareholder himself, Sir Martin Sorrell could attend today\u2019s AGM and ask a few searching questions. That\u2019s unlikely, though, as Sorrell signed a non-disclosure agreement when he left WPP in April. That NDA has prevented Sorrell responding in detail to the allegations aired in the papers in recent days. However, he has denied the Financial Times\u2019s claim that he was spotted entering a Mayfair brothel a year ago. As Sorrell\u2019s spokesman said earlier this week: Sir Martin signed a non-disclosure agreement when he stepped down which precludes him from discussing any of the circumstances surrounding his departure. He has rigidly adhered to this obligation and will continue to do so.\u201d Most WPP shareholders have already cast their votes ahead of today\u2019s AGM. Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman has heard that one in four are opposing the pay report -- presumably due to concern that Sorrell walked away with bonuses worth up to \u00a319m. Shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis is also lining up against Roberto Quarta, by advising investors to vote against the chairman\u2019s re-election. Glass Lewis said it also has \u201csevere reservations about supporting the remuneration report at this time.\u201d America\u2019s second-largest public pension fund will vote against the re-election of Roberto Quarta at WPP\u2019s annual meeting today. California-based Calstrs said it would vote against Mr Quarta\u2019s re-election, as well as the re-election of non-executive director Hugo Shong. The FT has more details. That\u2019s a blow to Quarta, who is already under pressure over his handling of Sorrell\u2019s exit (particularly his \u00a319bn bonus package). The Times also predicts a lively shareholder meeting: My colleague Rob Davies has pulled together a list of questions which WPP should answer at today\u2019s AGM regarding Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s shock departure earlier this year: Why did the company sign a non-disclosure agreement with Sorrell that prevents shareholders from understanding the reasons for his departure? Given the lack of transparency around the misconduct allegations, why is Sorrell classed as a \u201cgood leaver\u201d, granting him access to up to \u00a320m in future payments? What steps has the company taken to verify claims by company employees that they saw Sorrell entering a premises used by sex workers? Were board members aware of allegations that he misused company resources by making expense claims for personal costs, and if so, what did they do about them? Did board members know about allegations that Sorrell bullied his executive assistants, and if so, what did they do about them? Did board members offer sufficient challenge to Sorrell\u2019s reign over the company, or did they fall into line? Why was there no succession plan in place in case of Sorrell leaving the company suddenly, and what progress has been made in finding a successor? Were details of the investigation into Sorrell\u2019s conduct leaked by another board member, and if so, can investors have confidence in the board\u2019s functionality? Will there be cultural and strategic change at WPP, and if so, what would that entail? Are directors concerned Sorrell will lure clients to his new venture S4 Capital, and why does he not have a non-compete clause preventing him from setting up a rival firm? Does Roberto Quarta have enough time to serve as executive chairman of WPP, given that he is also chairman of Smith &amp; Nephew, another FTSE 100 company? The BBC predicts that around 25% of WPP shareholders will oppose the decision to hand Sorrell up to \u00a319m in bonuses over the next four years. Those payments are due because the company agreed to treat their departing CEO as a \u201cgood leaver\u201d, despite the investigation into his conduct. The front-runner to succeed Martin Sorrell at WPP has launched a review of the company\u2019s codes of conduct. Mark Read, chief executive of WPP\u2019s digital marketing agency Wunderman, wrote to all staff yesterday to remind staff of the company\u2019s \u201cvalues\u201d. Read highlighted some of the bullying allegations against Sorrell (he\u2019s accused of swearing at underlings and calling them useless). Read says: \u201cWhen I come to work I expect to be treated with respect by my colleagues, and every one of you reading this has the right to expect the same.\u201d \u201cYou will no doubt have read the press coverage this week about WPP and Martin Sorrell, including allegations about his behaviour towards people at the parent company. \u201cAlthough we can\u2019t comment on specific allegations, I feel we should remind ourselves of and reinforce the kind of values we want and need to have within every part of our business: values of fairness, tolerance, kindness and \u2013 again \u2013 respect. \u201cIt should hardly need saying that all WPP working environments must be places where people feel safe and supported. They must also be places where people are able to raise concerns if they want to, and where those concerns are dealt with when they need to be.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze is in the spotlight this morning, as we get new inflation figures showing how price changed in May. City economists predict that the Consumer Prices Index rose to around 2.5% last month, up from 2.4% in April, squeezing household budgets. That would be a blow to consumers, especially as we learned yesterday that basic wage growth slowed to 2.8% in the last quarter, Royal Bank of Canada predicts that CPI could even have hit 2.6%, which would almost wipe out real wage growth. They point out that petrol prices have risen steeply in recent weeks, as higher oil prices feed through to the pumps. On the other hand, Marc Br\u00fctsch of Swiss Life thinks inflation might be unchanged. So the pound could be volatile when the data is released, as inflation is a key factor determining whether the Bank of England raises interest rates soon. Advertising giant WPP will also dominate the headlines today, as it faces irate shareholders at its AGM. Investors are furious that former CEO Sir Martin Sorrell was allowed to quit the company in April with millions of pounds worth of share awards, despite facing allegations of personal misconduct. We\u2019ve subsequently learned that those allegations centred on claims of workplace bullying and paying for a sex worker using funds from WPP. Sorrell turned WPP from a small wire basket maker into the world\u2019s largest advertising company. He would have featured highly on a list of Britain\u2019s most respected executives - before recent events unfolded. Shareholders will demand answers about Sorrell\u2019s departure, and succession planning (or the lack of it) at WPP. Some will vote against WPP\u2019s pay policy, which is set to hand Sorrell future share awards worth up to \u00a320m, despite a lack of information about the reasons for his departure. Investors are also unhappy that Sorrell wasn\u2019t bound by a non-compete clause, allowing him to set up a new technology and content company called S4. There could also be a revolt against chairman Roberto Quarta. Tin hats could be needed....

      "bodyText": "A Dubai hotel has terminated its contract with the Michelin-starred chef Atul Kochhar after he tweeted that followers of Islam had \u201cterrorised\u201d Hindus for 2,000 years. The London-based chef, who is associated with the Rang Mahal restaurant in Dubai as well as five others in the UK and Spain, had been reacting to an episode of the US TV programme Quantico. A recent episode of the action series, which stars the Indian actor Priyanka Chopra, depicted a terrorist plot hatched by a group of Hindu nationalists. It provoked outrage among some Indians and Chopra apologised for the storyline at the weekend. Kochhar tweeted on Sunday: \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see that you [Chopra] have not respected the sentiments of Hindus who have been terrorized by Islam over 2000 years. Shame on You.\u201d He deleted the tweet the following day and apologised. \u201cThere is no justification for my tweet, a major error made in the heat of the moment on Sunday,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI fully recognise my inaccuracies that Islam was founded around 1,400 years ago and I sincerely apologise. I am not Islamophobic, I deeply regret my comments that have offended many.\u201d Kochhar was the second Indian chef to receive a Michelin star, awarded to his Benares restaurant in London in 2007. He apologised again on Wednesday after a flood of outraged on social media including threats to boycott his Dubai restaurant and the JW Marriott Marquis hotel that houses it. But the hotel announced on Wednesday afternoon it was terminating its relationship with the Indian-born chef, who has appeared in MasterChef in the UK and India. \u201cFollowing the recent comments made by chef Atul Kochhar, we have taken the decision to end our agreement with him for Rang Mahal,\u201d said a spokeswoman. \u201cAt the JW Marriott Marquis hotel Dubai we pride ourselves on creating a culture of diversity and inclusion for our guests and associates across the hotel and our restaurants.\u201d Kochhar said in a statement: \u201cThe decision by JW Marriott Marquis Dubai is deeply upsetting, however I fully accept the great pain I have caused and the difficult position the hotel has been put in. \u201cI have great respect for JW Marriott and in particular their staff in Dubai and wish the hotel well for the future. I hope my friends and well-wishers in Dubai will forgive me and continue to support me in the future.\u201d Islamic empires have claimed parts of the Indian subcontinent for more than 1,000 years and much of what is modern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh was ruled by the Muslim Mughals from the 16th century until they were displaced by the British. The Mughals integrated and became an Indian dynasty; about 172 million Muslims live in India today, one of the largest Islamic populations in the world. Hindu nationalists view the Mughal and earlier eras as a period of foreign rule when their traditions and culture were diluted. This nationalist or Hindutva vision was once fringe but has increasingly become mainstream in the past three decades. Soon after he was elected prime minister in 2014, Narendra Modi, a staunch Hindu nationalist, told parliament the country needed to throw off its \u201cslave mentality of 1,200 years\u201d \u2013 seen as a reference to the period of Islamic and British rule. ABC studios, which produces Quantico, apologised for the storyline on Sunday and defended Chopra, who they said \u201cdidn\u2019t create the show, nor ... write or direct it\u201d. It added: \u201cThe show has featured antagonists of many different ethnicities and backgrounds, but in this case we inadvertently and regrettably stepped into a complex political issue. It was certainly not our intention to offend anyone.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK inflation unexpectedly stayed at a one-year low last month, despite average petrol prices rising to the highest level for almost four years. The consumer prices index (CPI) remained at 2.4% in May for the second month running, according to the Office for National Statistics, confounding economists\u2019 expectations for the rate to increase to 2.6% amid rising global oil prices. Statisticians said the falling cost of computer games, sweets and chocolate helped to offset the rising price of petrol, as British motorists came under growing financial pressure. The ONS said the average price of petrol rose by 4.6 pence a litre between April and May to 125.3 pence last month \u2013 the highest level since October 2014. Crude oil prices on global markets are now more than 40% higher than a year earlier. Having a knock-on effect for petrol prices, the RAC said some retailers have raised their prices every day since mid April. The ONS also recorded the first annual fall in private rental prices in London since September 2010, which were down 0.2% in the 12 months to May. Average house price growth across the UK also slowed, falling to a rate of 3.9% in the year to April, down from 4.2% in March. While the surprise inflation reading may comfort hard-pressed consumers, hit by a sharp increase in living costs since the EU referendum, the latest snapshot from the ONS could add to pressure on the Bank of England to delay raising interest rates as the UK economy falters. Weak economic growth deterred the central bank from raising the cost of borrowing last month. Threadneedle Street said at the time it expected inflation to rise over the coming months owing to higher global oil prices and energy bills, before resuming a downward trend. Inflation has gradually been fading from a five-year high of 3.1% in November, as the effects of the sudden fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote begin to fade. The inflation data followed news on Tuesday of an unexpected slowdown in wage growth, which could also deter the Bank from raising the cost of borrowing. Pay rises are only just outstripping the rate of inflation, with average earnings growth excluding bonuses growing at an annual rate of 2.5%. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cThe case for higher interest rates is falling further away. Instead of an autumn rate rise, we will need an autumn boost in the budget to get the economy moving and wages rising faster.\u201d However, some economists believe the high prices for petrol and diesel could mean inflation sticking close to 2.5% over the course of the summer, which may spur the Bank to raise the cost of borrowing. Threadneedle Street has a target rate of 2% set by the government. Coming at a time of weak economic data, with Britain close to the bottom of the G7 growth league, Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC and former member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting committee, said the UK seemed to be in a period of stagflation \u2013 a term used by economists to describe low levels of growth coupled with high inflation. Inflation sticking stubbornly above target could push Threadneedle Street to raise the cost of borrowing, he said, adding: \u201cThe combination of Brexit and the Bank\u2019s reluctance to raise interest rates is creating a very uncomfortable position for the UK economy.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Gig economy: heating engineer wins claim against Pimlico Plumbers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Employment rights of workers in the gig economy have been boosted after a heating engineer won his claim against Pimlico Plumbers at the supreme court, establishing that he was a worker and not self-employed. The supreme court\u2019s unanimous judgment is likely to set a significant precedent for a series of protracted legal battles, such as those involving the cab firms Uber and Addison Lee, which are in dispute with their drivers over their employment status. Pimlico Plumbers, which lost at every stage of the dispute, had appealed to the UK\u2019s highest court, arguing that those it sent out to repair leaking pipes and malfunctioning dishwashers were self-employed and not \u201cworkers\u201d. Workers do not enjoy the full range of employment protection rights given to full-time staff but are entitled to many elements such as holiday pay. The claim was brought by Gary Smith, from Kent, who worked for Pimlico Plumbers as a plumber and heating engineer for six years until 2011, when he suffered a heart attack. He claimed his subsequent request for a three-day week was rejected, the Pimlico Plumbers van he rented was taken away, and he was dismissed. The firm disputed Smith\u2019s assertion that he was sacked because he wanted to work fewer days. Delivering judgment, on Wednesday, Lord Wilson said: \u201cAlthough the contract did provide him with elements of operational and financial independence, Mr Smith\u2019s services to the company\u2019s customers were marketed through the company. \u201cMore importantly, its term enabled the company to exercise tight administrative control over him during his periods of work for it; to impose fierce conditions on when and how much it paid to him, which were described at one point as his wages; and to restrict his ability to compete with it for plumbing work following any termination of their relationship. \u201cWe hold that the [employment] tribunal was entitled to conclude that the company cannot be regarded as a client or customer of Mr Smith.\u201d Smith\u2019s application for compensation will be reconsidered by the lower court. Some aspects of Smith\u2019s conditions resembled self-employment, such as the entitlement to refuse work, the judgment said, but others \u201cbetrayed a grip on his economy inconsistent with his being a truly independent contractor\u201d. These included the fact that he wore a branded uniform, had a tracker in his branded van and carried an identity card. Outside the court, Charlie Mullins, the founder of Pimlico Plumbers, said he was considering taking an appeal against the decision to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet,\u201d Mullins said. \u201cWe are going to take it to the next stage if we can and prove this chap was self-employed. At the worst, we will go back to the tribunal and fight it. Around 4.8 million subcontractors in the UK will be affected by this decision. The government needs to step in and provide clarity to the employment laws.\u201d Smith said he was pleased with the outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s a great weight off my shoulders. It\u2019s been like carrying around a giant rucksack\u201d he said. \u201cI will celebrate with a stiff drink. It feels good. It\u2019s been an arduous seven-year battle. I\u2019m now a properly self-employed plumber.\u201d The Equality and Human Rights Commission has funded Smith\u2019s case since 2015. Its chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, said: \u201cIf you wear the uniform, if you drive the branded vehicle, if you only work for one business, you are employed. That means you are entitled to the appropriate protections and adjustments which go with the job, to enable you to work safely and productively. Thousands of workers like Gary Smith could now find themselves with the added security of benefits like sick pay and holiday pay.\u201d Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), said: \u201cThe problem of employment rights in the so-called gig-economy is not confusion in the law but rather companies who think the law need not be obeyed. Pimlico Plumbers lost its argument over worker status four times in a row. We now need the government to start actively enforcing the law rather than playing the role of useless bystander.\u201d The TUC\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThis case has exposed how widely sham self-employment has spread. Bad employers are using every trick in the book to deny staff basic rights. It\u2019s time to end the Wild West in the gig economy. The government must get tough on rogue bosses and give unions the right to organise in more workplaces.\u201d The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: \u201cThis is a landmark victory for workers who have had enough of precarious conditions. Pimlico Plumbers and companies like it must put an immediate end to exploitative practices and ensure that their workers have full access to their legal rights, such as the minimum wage and sick pay.\u201d But Susannah Kintish, an employment specialist at the law firm Mishcon de Reya, who represented Mullins, said: \u201cAll eyes will be on the government as businesses await legislation on how to categorise their workforce \u2013 something which could still be a matter of years away. The supreme court justices have made it clear that this judgment is very specific to the unique facts of the case.\u201d",

These included the fact that he wore a branded uniform, had a tracker in his branded van and carried an identity card.<br></p> <p>Outside the court, Charlie Mullins, the founder of Pimlico Plumbers, said he was considering taking an appeal against the decision to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet,\u201d Mullins said. \u201cWe are going to take it to the next stage if we can and prove this chap was self-employed. At the worst, we will go back to the tribunal and fight it. Around 4.8 million subcontractors in the UK will be affected by this decision. The government needs to step in and provide clarity to the employment laws.\u201d</p> <p>Smith said he was pleased with the outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s a great weight off my shoulders. It\u2019s been like carrying around a giant rucksack\u201d he said. \u201cI will celebrate with a stiff drink. It feels good. It\u2019s been an arduous seven-year battle. I\u2019m now a properly self-employed plumber.\u201d </p> <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission has funded Smith\u2019s case since 2015. Its chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, said: \u201cIf you wear the uniform, if you drive the branded vehicle, if you only work for one business, you are employed. That means you are entitled to the appropriate protections and adjustments which go with the job, to enable you to work safely and productively. Thousands of workers like Gary Smith could now find themselves with the added security of benefits like sick pay and holiday pay.\u201d </p> <p>Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), said: \u201cThe problem of employment rights in the so-called gig-economy is not confusion in the law but rather companies who think the law need not be obeyed. Pimlico Plumbers lost its argument over worker status four times in a row. We now need the government to start actively enforcing the law rather than playing the role of useless bystander.\u201d</p> <p>The TUC\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThis case has exposed how widely sham self-employment has spread. Bad employers are using every trick in the book to deny staff basic rights. It\u2019s time to end the Wild West in the gig economy. The government must get tough on rogue bosses and give unions the right to organise in more workplaces.\u201d</p> <p>The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: \u201cThis is a landmark victory for workers who have had enough of precarious conditions. Pimlico Plumbers and companies like it must put an immediate end to exploitative practices and ensure that their workers have full access to their legal rights, such as the minimum wage and sick pay.\u201d </p> <p>But Susannah Kintish, an employment specialist at the law firm Mishcon de Reya, who represented Mullins, said: \u201cAll eyes will be on the government as businesses await legislation on how to categorise their workforce \u2013 something which could still be a matter of years away. The supreme court justices have made it clear that this judgment is very specific to the unique facts of the case.\u201d</p> <p></p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia could become mired in a low-wage, low-inflation environment if incomes keep growing at near record-low levels, the Reserve Bank governor has warned. In a speech that will dampen expectations of strong wages growth in coming years, RBA governor Philip Lowe said he was still trying to figure out why countries such as Australia were not experiencing the traditional increase in wages growth in response to tightening labour markets. He said he still believed wages could eventually start growing at an annual rate of 3% again, rather than the current low of 2%, but it will be a process that could take years. \u201cWe are still trying to understand fully why things look different in so many countries and how persistent it will be,\u201d he told the Australian Industry Group on Wednesday. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon \u201cPart of the story is likely to be changes in the bargaining power of workers and an increase in the supply of workers as the global economy becomes more integrated. \u201cBut another important part of the story lies in the nature of recent technological progress \u2026 the benefits of new technologies are accruing unevenly across the community.\u201d In April, Lowe had told a business audience in Western Australia that the economy\u2019s painful run of record low wages growth may have finally troughed, and that wages could be expected to grow more quickly from this point. But on Wednesday he cautioned that the process could take time. He said persistently slow wages growth was contributing to persistently weak inflation, and if wages growth remained near its current rate for an \u201cextended period\u201d, the rate of inflation could fail to average at the midpoint of the RBA\u2019s target in coming year. \u201cWages growth of 2% and reasonable labour productivity growth are unlikely to make for 2.5% inflation on a sustained basis,\u201d he said. \u201cSome pick-up in wages growth would be a welcome development. It would help deliver a rate of inflation consistent with the target, it would help with the debt situation and it would add to our sense of shared prosperity. \u201c[But] this pick-up is expected to be only gradual given both the spare capacity that still exists in our labour market and the structural factors at work,\u201d he said. Given the difficult task of fully understanding current wage dynamics, Lowe said Australia needed to focus on lifting education and research levels, and improving worker-related training, because that was historically a way to boost productivity. \u201cUltimately, the basis for sustained growth in real wages is that we become more productive as a nation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe recent productivity data are difficult to interpret. Despite a positive outcome in the most recent quarter, there has been no net increase in measured labour productivity over the past two years.\u201d Lowe said the design of the tax system, the provision and pricing of infrastructure, and Australian business culture around innovation were also important elements in the productivity debate. \u201cWe need to keep all these areas on the radars of both government and business if we are to build on the current prosperity that we currently enjoy,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "MPs have called on Britain\u2019s banks and other financial firms to tackle their \u201calpha male culture\u201d, in a parliamentary report that recommends measures to close the City\u2019s gender pay gap including clearer criteria for awarding bonuses and senior male executives taking up flexible working. The Treasury committee\u2019s report follows its investigation into women in finance, and found the alpha male culture was the main reason women gave for not wanting to work in senior management at City firms. This culture was particularly evident in bonus negotiations, in which men can receive bigger rewards by arguing more forcefully, the report said. The report cited a \u201cpyramid\u201d model at financial firms, where the proportion of women to men dwindles at the upper levels of management. It comes two months after the deadline for all UK companies with more than 250 employees to report their gender pay gap. This revealed banks are among companies with the biggest pay gaps in the UK, with Barclays\u2019 investment banking arm reporting a 43.5% median gap in favour of men and a 73% gap for bonuses. The national average median pay gap is 18.4%. The Women in Finance report found that the median bonus pay gap is 49% in favour of men at UK banks, and 38% at building societies. The bonus gap is 43.5% overall, meaning that for every \u00a3100,000 of bonuses handed out to men, women are only getting \u00a356,500. The gender pay gap per hour in finance is 28%. \u201cThe benefits of gender diversity are highlighted in the report, including better financial performance, reduced groupthink and more open discussions,\u201d said Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP and Treasury select committee chair. \u201cThe next step must be for firms to set out how they will abolish their gender pay gap and support the progression of women. Firms should focus on changing the culture in financial services firms, which remains a deterrent for women, especially the bonus culture.\u201d The 51-page report \u2013 which includes insight from senior industry figures including Anne Richards, chief executive of fund manager M&amp;G Investments, and Virgin Money chief Jayne-Anne Gadhia \u2013 also calls on senior men to tackle the stigma associated with flexible working, which is perceived as a \u201cfemale\u201d approach and can knock career progression. Senior men are being urged to \u201clead by example\u201d by working flexibly themselves, helping displace a culture of presenteeism where staff work unnecessarily long hours in the office. Other recommendations include: Encouraging firms to publish strategies for closing gender pay gaps Partners and subsidiary companies should not be exempt from gender pay gap reporting Firms should re-examine recruitment and promotion policies to eliminate unconscious bias Richards said: \u201cIf you do not have objective criteria, women tend to be paid disproportionately less than men. The more objective you make the criteria, the more balance you get into it. That is about societal conditioning.\u201d Gadhia, who led the Treasury review of women in finance in 2016, said she had seen \u201calpha-male-ness\u201d in her colleagues\u2019 behaviour and \u201ca very male culture\u201d in some organisations in which she had worked. The committee said partners of law and accounting firms and company subsidiaries that have fewer than 250 employees should not be exempt from gender pay gap reporting. It also said that regulators such as the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority, whose gender pay gaps show similar trends to the financial services sector, needed to act as a role model in appointing more women to senior roles.",

      "bodyText": "The Indian mining company Adani has sought federal approval to expand a dam by 450% and build a pipeline for its Carmichael coalmine, without an assessment under national environment laws. In an application to the environment and energy department, Adani said it did not believe an environmental impact statement was needed because assessments had been done under previous applications for other parts of the mining project. The project, which it calls the north Galilee water scheme, would increase an existing 2.2bn-litre dam to 10bn litres and build associated infrastructure, including 110km of pipeline, in three sections, to transport water from the Suttor river and Burdekin basin. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The company has argued its proposal did not require review under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act for impacts on threatened species, or under the water trigger, a component of the act that mandates coalmining and coal seam gas projects that have significant impacts on water resources must undergo national environmental assessment. In its application, Adani said the water trigger applied only to projects associated with extraction. It said the pipeline was a piece of associated infrastructure and a separate project that therefore did not trigger assessment for impacts on water. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly narrow reading of the EPBC act,\u201d said Christian Slattery, an Australian Conservation Foundation Stop Adani campaigner. \u201cClearly it\u2019s a project connected with coalmining. \u201cIf this interpretation is accepted by the minister it further demonstrates the weaknesses of the EPBC act and the need for a new generation of environmental laws.\u201d In its application, Adani said there was also potential for its dam and pipeline to supply water for other coalmining projects in the Galilee basin, such as the China Stone coal project. A spokeswoman for the environment and energy department said the proposal was open to public comment until 25 June, after which a decision would be made \u201con whether the proposal requires further detailed assessment under national environment law\u201d. An Adani spokeswoman said the company already had approvals from the Queensland government for its water licence, water storage and a portion of the water pipeline. \u201cAdani Australia has now submitted a referral for the construction of a 61km water supply pipeline for the Carmichael mine,\u201d she said. \u201cThis referral relates only to how we protect the environment during construction of the pipeline, in consideration of approvals already received.\u201d Labor\u2019s environment spokesman, Tony Burke, said the government should ensure a thorough and rigorous environmental assessment was conducted. \u201cIs Adani arguing that the use of this water is completely unrelated to the fact that they want to dig a mine, or that this particular mine is not large?\u201d he said. \u201cOr are they claiming that they are now engaged in a completely different business? \u201cAdani cannot evade the scrutiny of the expert independent scientific committee, and the minister for the environment should not be facilitating an opportunity for Adani to avoid scientific scrutiny on its use of water.\u201d",
