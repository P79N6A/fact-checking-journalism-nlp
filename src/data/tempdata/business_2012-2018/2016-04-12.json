That, at least, seems to be the government\u2019s position after another day in which the business secretary, Sajid Javid, used the term \u201cco-investment\u201d imprecisely but deliberately. \u201cThe key point is that any co-investment would have to be on commercial terms,\u201d Javid told the Commons. \u201cInvestment can take a variety of forms; for example, it could be debt. It\u2019s a demonstration of all the options the government is looking at.\u201d The natural way to interpret that statement is that investment could be in the form of equity or debt, or both. Javid\u2019s specific mention of debt probably indicates his preference, but he plainly did not rule out the government taking a minority stake as an equity owner. As for the \u201ccommercial terms\u201d condition, that is loose: any turnaround plan has to be coherent but viability, in part, is in the eye of the beholder. Part-nationalisation would represent a huge ideological leap for the government but, once the idea has been floated, it is hard to make it disappear. Imagine you are an interested would-be purchaser on the other side of the negotiating table. Would you rather buy Port Talbot outright and be relatively free of government meddling in day-to-day affairs? Or would you prefer to have a co-investor that has substantial powers to tilt the commercial playing field in your favour on energy subsidies, emissions regulations and business rates? Some would-be owners, it is true, might not want politicians in their hair. But the overwhelming majority, one suspects, would opt for a co-owner with law-making clout and a need to show taxpayers\u2019 money is being deployed profitably.

He is 56, is seen to have had a good innings \u2013 first as Whitbread\u2019s finance director, then as managing director of Costa \u2013 so can expect to receive an offer or two to be a big boss elsewhere. The other moral to draw is that Alison Brittain, new-ish Whitbread chief, has heard the City\u2019s lobbying for Costa to be spun off as an independent company and decided to ignore it. If it were otherwise, Rogers would presumably hang around to lead the liberation. If demerger is off the agenda, Brittain has done the right thing. The investment bankers\u2019 theory that Costa is somehow an under-valued or hidden jewel within Whitbread has always seemed half-baked. The idea rests on little more than the observation that Starbucks is a highly valued stock. But Starbucks has already done its international expansion, whereas Costa\u2019s earnings are still dominated by the UK and its Chinese adventure is only just approaching break-even level. They are very different businesses. Nor is Whitbread a complicated conglomerate. It has only two major moving parts \u2013 Costa and the Premier Inn hotel chain \u2013 so it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to value. Keep the coffee and only think about demerger in about a decade\u2019s time. Boardroom pay anomaly Take your pick: pay for chief executives of FTSE 100 companies is flatlining in an admirable display of boardroom restraint; or else the 20-year trend of rewards outstripping inflation continues unabated. The first view comes from consultants PwC, which reckons that total pay \u2013 salary, bonus, long-term incentives and pension payments \u2013 for chief executives rose 1% last year. The latter analysis comes from the High Pay Centre, which has added up the numbers to reach a figure of 6%. Why the discrepancy? It may be a simple case of different sample sizes. PwC says it looked at the first 47 remuneration reports of this year from FTSE 100 firms, but the High Pay Centre is further advanced and has studied the first 62 annual reports. On that basis, the 6% figure looks more solid. We should not be surprised. Of more concern is PwC\u2019s claim that \u201cexecutive pay is now harder to earn than in the past.\u201d Really? That\u2019s not the way it looks at, say, BP, where even some timorous fund managers are aghast that chief executive Bob Dudley could collect $19.6m (\u00a313.8m) in a loss-making year when thousands lost their jobs . A few fund managers may even vote against BP\u2019s pay report on Thursday \u2013 but, note, the poll is purely advisory. Come on, PwC, life hasn\u2019t changed terribly much.",

    "webTitle": "Executive pay up almost 6% according to thinktank analysis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s top bosses have continued to enjoy generous pay rises despite greater scrutiny of executive rewards, according to the latest data from the High Pay Centre. FTSE 100 companies that have reported pay deals so far this year have given their chief executives an aggregate 6% rise, figures from the thinktank showed. The average package was worth \u00a35.6m. The calculation was based on the so-called \u201csingle figure\u201d pay disclosure of 62 top flight companies that have published their pay reports for the 2015 financial year. The figure includes salary, bonus, long term incentives and pensions. Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, said: \u201cThe evidence, which is coming directly from companies\u2019 own annual reports, is that the 20-year rising trend in top company pay continues unabated. \u201cThe UK\u2019s new disclosure rules now allow investors to observe this as it happens, but the latent power possessed by investors to call a halt to these excessive rewards remains largely unexercised.\u201d Since 2013 shareholders have had the power to reject company pay plans. However, in a separate report that focused on salary alone, consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) suggested the UK\u2019s top companies were showing \u201crestraint\u201d when awarding increases to bosses. In an analysis of pay reports from 47 FTSE 100 companies for 2016, the accountancy firm found that chief executives and chief financial officers received a median salary increase of 2%. When stripping out the 42% of chief executives whose pay was frozen, median salaries increased by 3%, with a median base salary for chief executives of \u00a3941,000, according to PwC. Fiona Camenzuli, reward and employment partner at PwC, said that while salaries were frozen for only a minority of bosses, it was a high proportion compared with the longer term trend. She said: \u201cRemuneration committees are continuing to make tougher judgments on pay outcomes and coupled with greater scrutiny of performance targets, requirements to hold shares for longer and malus and clawback provisions, mean executive pay is now harder to earn than in the past. \u201cShareholders expect total payouts for the year to be a fair reflection of overall performance and greater transparency. The improvement in the quality of bonus target disclosure has been a triumph of collective shareholder action \u2013 the result is a definitive move to a market norm of full retrospective target disclosure to enable investors to assess the toughness of targets.\u201d The High Pay Centre said however that the idea the UK\u2019s top companies were showing restraint in top executives\u2019 pay levels was \u201ctroubling\u201d. Camenzuli accepted that in the context of the general public, executive pay was still high. \u201cThis whole concept of fairness is at the centre of boardroom debate. It\u2019s a very live issue,\u201d she said. PwC added in its report: \u201cWith inequality being the issue du jour, we shouldn\u2019t expect the attention to move away from executive pay anytime soon.\u201d The average UK worker suffered from six years of falling wages in real terms from 2008 as inflation outpaced pay growth. Pay growth has since picked up, but is still below pre-crisis levels and has remained sluggish despite other signs of improvement in the UK jobs market, where employment is at a record high of 31.4 million. In the latest available official data, average weekly earnings for employees rose 2.1% in the three months to January compared with a year earlier. The TUC has warned that a full recovery in the value of wages is still years away, with average weekly earnings still worth \u00a340 a week less than before the financial crash. It comes as companies face the prospect of shareholder anger over executive pay at their annual meetings over the next two months. A group representing individual shareholders has advised BP investors to vote against chief exexcutive Bob Dudley\u2019s $20m (\u00a314m) pay. ShareSoc said Dudley\u2019s pay was too high for a company that suffered a record loss last year. Housebuilder Persimmon is also facing a potential shareholder revolt over executive pay at its annual meeting on Thursday. PwC is planning to publish its full executive pay survey of FTSE 100 companies in June, giving a more comprehensive picture.",

The average package was worth \u00a35.6m.</p> <p>The calculation was based on the so-called \u201csingle figure\u201d pay disclosure of 62 top flight companies that have published their pay reports for the 2015 financial year. The figure includes salary, bonus, long term incentives and pensions.</p> <p>Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, said: \u201cThe evidence, which is coming directly from companies\u2019 own annual reports, is that the 20-year rising trend in top company pay continues unabated. </p> <p>\u201cThe UK\u2019s new disclosure rules now allow investors to observe this as it happens, but the latent power possessed by investors to call a halt to these excessive rewards remains largely unexercised.\u201d</p> <p>Since 2013 shareholders have had the power to reject company pay plans.</p> <p>However, in a separate report that focused on salary alone, consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) suggested the UK\u2019s top companies were showing \u201crestraint\u201d when awarding increases to bosses.</p> <p>In an analysis of pay reports from 47 FTSE 100 companies for 2016, the accountancy firm found that chief executives and chief financial officers received a median salary increase of 2%. </p> <p>When stripping out the 42% of chief executives whose pay was frozen, median salaries increased by 3%, with a median base salary for chief executives of \u00a3941,000, according to PwC.</p> <p>Fiona Camenzuli, reward and employment partner at PwC, said that while salaries were frozen for only a minority of bosses, it was a high proportion compared with the longer term trend.<br></p> <p>She said: \u201cRemuneration committees are continuing to make tougher judgments on pay outcomes and coupled with greater scrutiny of performance targets, requirements to hold shares for longer and malus and clawback provisions, mean executive pay is now harder to earn than in the past.</p> <p>\u201cShareholders expect total payouts for the year to be a fair reflection of overall performance and greater transparency. The improvement in the quality of bonus target disclosure has been a triumph of collective shareholder action \u2013 the result is a definitive move to a market norm of full retrospective target disclosure to enable investors to assess the toughness of targets.\u201d </p> <p>The High Pay Centre said however that the idea the UK\u2019s top companies were showing restraint in top executives\u2019 pay levels was \u201ctroubling\u201d.</p> <p>Camenzuli accepted that in the context of the general public, executive pay was still high.</p> <p>\u201cThis whole concept of fairness is at the centre of boardroom debate. It\u2019s a very live issue,\u201d she said.</p> <p>PwC added in its report: \u201cWith inequality being the issue du jour, we shouldn\u2019t expect the attention to move away from executive pay anytime soon.\u201d</p> <p>The average UK worker suffered from six years of falling wages in real terms from 2008 as inflation outpaced pay growth.</p> <p>Pay growth has since picked up, but is still below pre-crisis levels and has remained sluggish despite other signs of improvement in the UK jobs market, where employment is at a record high of 31.4 million.</p> <p>In the latest available official data, average weekly earnings for employees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/16/uk-unemployment-10-year-low-wage-growth-edges-up\">rose 2.1% in the three months to January</a> compared with a year earlier.</p> <p>The TUC has warned that a full recovery in the value of wages is still years away, with average weekly earnings still worth \u00a340 a week less than before the financial crash.</p> <p>It comes as companies face the prospect of shareholder anger over executive pay at their annual meetings over the next two months. </p> <p>A group representing individual shareholders has advised BP investors to vote against chief exexcutive Bob Dudley\u2019s $20m (\u00a314m) pay. ShareSoc said Dudley\u2019s pay was too high for a company that suffered a record loss last year.</p> <p>Housebuilder Persimmon is also facing a potential shareholder revolt over executive pay at its annual meeting on Thursday.<br></p> <p>PwC is planning to publish its full executive pay survey of FTSE 100 companies in June, giving a more comprehensive picture.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "B&amp;Q is offering workers two years\u2019 compensation and further negotiations over their pay packages after nearly 136,000 people signed a petition against the retailer\u2019s planned cuts to employee benefits. The DIY chain announced in February that it would be cutting Sunday pay and reducing bank holiday pay and bonuses for some staff. B&amp;Q raised basic pay to a minimum rate of \u00a37.66 an hour from 1 April \u2013 46p more than the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which came into force this month. Previously, some staff were on the minimum wage of \u00a36.70. On Tuesday, the company said it had extended compensation so that no staff members would lose out over the next two years. \u201cOver the next two years, we will continue to work with our colleagues to look at ways we can enhance our overall reward package to ensure we remain one of the best and most attractive employers in retail,\u201d a B&amp;Q spokesperson said. The retailer said all staff, not just those aged over 25, receive the basic hourly wage of \u00a37.66 an hour and that it paid a bonus of up to 10% of salary. Staff also get a paid half-hour break for every four-hour shift, as well as pension benefits. The offer of further compensation for shop workers comes after the Guardian revealed that B&amp;Q had withdrawn an advertisement for jobs at its Swindon warehouse that required jobseekers to work a three day \u201cinduction\u201d for free and pay for a drugs test. The DIY chain is one of a string of businesses to cut back on perks and benefits for staff as it tries to fund an increase in basic pay rates as a result of the national living wage of \u00a37.20 an hour for over-25s, which came into force this month. On Tuesday, it emerged that sandwich chain Eat had stopped paying staff for their half-hour breaks in return for a pay rise. The company said no employees had lost out, as it had raised average staff pay to \u00a37.60 an hour after stopping payment for breaks in February and giving everyone a free lunch. Last week, coffee chain Caffe Nero admitted that it had stopped providing free food. Instead, staff are offered a discount on food and drink and all workers, regardless of age, will earn at least the national living wage. Tesco and cut-price chain Wilko announced changes to holiday pay in February, while Morrisons said it would cut Sunday pay and paid breaks last September. The makers of Ginsters pasties, Samworth Brothers, which employs 8,500 people, has also cut Sunday and bank holiday pay and removed paid tea breaks. It admits that even after the wage increase, some workers\u2019 pay will fall by \u00a35 a week.",

      "bodyText": "Labour has warned there are just 16 weeks to save Tata Steel\u2019s UK plants, despite the business secretary, Sajid Javid, claiming he has persuaded the company to keep them open until a buyer is found. Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said Labour has learned that Tata wishes to exit the UK in four months, with just eight weeks for potential buyers to submit an expression of interest and another eight for due diligence. However, Javid insisted he has secured a \u201creprieve\u201d until a sale has happened, even though Tata initially wanted to shut its UK plants down completely. Javid made the claim that he saved the plants from immediate closure after receiving fierce criticism for flying to Australia for a trade trip and short holiday at the time Tata announced it was planning to pull out of the UK. Anna Soubry, the business minister, defended her boss in a session of the Commons Welsh affairs committee on Tuesday, saying he \u201cwould not have gone to Australia if he thought they were going to close the ruddy works\u201d. She said Javid was aware of the risk of imminent closure and persuaded them to think again, freeing him up to proceed with the trade trip. \u201cWe thought everything was sorted out,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mistake we made I think was when we got the message that there wasn\u2019t going to be the period of time we wanted. We wanted to absolutely firm that up with Tata. To be fair it took very little time to achieve that.\u201d Soubry said work had begun on trying to save Tata\u2019s UK steel plants as long ago as October and that when she took the ministerial job, David Cameron had warned her: \u201cAnna, we have real problems in our steel industry.\u201d She then launched into a tirade against the steel industry for being too demanding of the government. \u201cWe achieve what we are asked to achieve,\u201d she told MPs. \u201cYou guys [industry] move the goalposts. You say take action on tariffs and dumping. We take action. \u2018Oh that\u2019s not good enough, let\u2019s find something else we can make an ask of.\u2019 We take action on energy costs. \u2018Oh, let\u2019s find something else.\u2019 Every time. \u201cThe only thing we haven\u2019t delivered on of asks that where made of us at the steel summit in September is rates. And plants and machinery. That is because it would have cost \u00a32bn to deliver \u00a340m of benefits to the steel industry.\u201d However, Labour MPs laid into Javid and Soubry for failing to act on their longstanding concerns, accusing them of a laissez-faire attitude to the steel industry. Javid revealed on Monday that the UK government could \u201cco-invest\u201d with a new buyer of the Port Talbot plant and other assets. But both he and his minister refused to elaborate on what that could mean beyond confirming it would be on commercial terms and could mean offering a loan. Soubry also revealed she had expressed \u201cvery serious expressions of interest\u201d in buying Tata\u2019s steel assets by email and text message. However, Labour believed the government was not acting quickly enough. During an emergency three-hour Commons debate, Eagle said: \u201cIt took nine months for the Scunthorpe deal to be developed, yet Tata has indicated that it wishes to exit the UK in four months. \u201cWhat is the business secretary doing to reassure the existing customer base that their current and future contracts will be fulfilled during this period of uncertainty? The plants cannot be saved if their order books disappear.\u201d Other MPs cast doubt on Javid\u2019s claims that he had saved the UK plants from closure. Iain Wright, the Labour chair of the Commons business committee, said: \u201cIf he was fully aware of the enormity of the crisis and he still flew to Australia rather than Mumbai, the evidence has to suggest he was left blindsided by Tata\u2019s decision.\u201d Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, added: \u201cIf the secretary of state really knew what was coming, then why on earth was he on the other side of the world when the board meeting took place? \u201cIf the secretary of state was really as in the know as he claimed to be, why did he have to rush back to the UK in a mad panic?\u201d Javid has also been criticised for opposing changes to EU trade rules that could help the steel industry. In the Commons, Javid argued that the UK opposed scrapping the lesser duty rule as it would have \u201ccost British shoppers dear\u201d, including an extra \u00a3130m a year on the price of footwear \u2013 the equivalent of about \u00a34.80 for each household. A number of EU countries have been trying to get the rule lifted, as it would allow higher tariffs to be imposed on cut-price Chinese steel being dumped on the world market. The industry, Labour MPs and unions have blamed Chinese dumping for the crisis facing the steel industry, which has led Tata to announce it is withdrawing from the UK, risking tens of thousands of jobs. Meanwhile, Tata has indicated it is not prepared to hand over a dowry to any buyer of its UK business, despite the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales needing hundreds of millions of pounds in new investment to survive. Financial sweeteners from Tata could help attract a saviour for its UK business, which is losing at least \u00a31m a day and has just weeks to secure its future. However, Koushik Chatterjee, the group executive director of Tata Steel, said the Indian company did not provide a dowry as part of the deal to sell its Scunthorpe steelworks to Greybull, and is selling the rest of the business because it cannot afford the running costs.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair is overhauling its complicated and expensive baggage charging policy in one of the biggest changes at the airline since it started handing out seat numbers. The initiative is part of the Irish airline\u2019s rehabilitation, which began in 2013 when, in the face of falling profits, its outspoken chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, announced that the airline would stop trying to \u201cunnecessarily piss people off\u201d. Ryanair hopes that its image will be further enhanced by the introduction of new-look cabins with bigger windows and an extra inch of legroom, courtesy of the new Boeing 737-800s joining its fleet. The neutral colour scheme dispenses with the trademark bright yellow overhead lockers and bulkheads of old, and adds less harsh LED lighting. O\u2019Leary conceded that the airline had placed \u201coverzealous\u201d restrictions on baggage in the past and that offering the cheapest fares was no longer enough in a competitive market. \u201cMy approach was, you\u2019re getting the lowest fare, an on-time flight, we won\u2019t cancel and we won\u2019t lose your bags. Now shut up, sit down and don\u2019t complain,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been transformed.\u201d Ryanair is making its baggage policy simpler by cutting the number of payment options from 108 to six, although some people will end up paying more. The no-frills airline currently charges different fees for each checked-in bag depending on whether it weighs up to 15kg or 20kg, whether it is the passenger\u2019s first or second bag, and whether the flight is in high or low season. This year, it will launch a \u201crate my flight\u201d function on its mobile app, where customers can leave instant feedback on their flight experience, and an Amazon-style one tap payment for its phone app, enabling customers to pay for services such as express security checks and upgrades. Ebullient from Saturday\u2019s Grand National win with Rule The World, O\u2019Leary said he he\u2019d been swallowing \u201cbig doses of humility\u201d since the business embarked on the \u201calways getting better\u201d plan two years ago. At that time, with customers defecting to rival carriers Aer Lingus and easyJet, it introduced allocated seating for the first time and ended the tyranny of limiting passengers to one carry-on bag. \u201cWe had locked ourselves into a position of \u2018We\u2019re cheaper, nastier and we don\u2019t care\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there were millions of passengers saying \u2018I don\u2019t care how cheap you are\u2019.\u201d The airline\u2019s new approach to customer service seems to be paying off: at its half year results, Ryanair said pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September rose by 37% to \u20ac1.09bn (\u00a3870m). Its share price has increased to more than \u20ac13 from \u20ac6.50 in late 2014. The airline\u2019s existing baggage policy had been described as \u201canti-family\u201d due to the escalating cost of stowing luggage in the hold. But O\u2019Leary denied that this was the case. \u201cThe purpose of the bag fee was never to penalise people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was to incentivise people to travel with less checked bags.\u201d The majority of passengers checking in bags do so in high season, meaning that they will pay a lower price under the changes, Ryanair said. Passengers will still have to pay more on longer routes, such as London to the Canary Islands. O\u2019Leary said the airline was considering introducing a flat fee of \u201cprobably\u201d \u00a330, with the company expected to spell out the details next month.",

    "webTitle": "Blairs add Manchester flats to property empire before stamp duty deadline", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Cherie Blair and her eldest son, Euan, appear to have added recently to the family\u2019s property empire, with files for their company showing they took out a mortgage on four flats in the north-west shortly before a new tax for landlords and second homebuyers came into force. Records for Oldbury Residential show that it registered a charge with Companies House, related to four properties in the Whalley Range area of Manchester, a suburb a couple of miles from the city centre popular with young professionals. The flats are each likely to bring in around \u00a3500 a month in rent, a total of \u00a324,000 a year before tax. The charge on the property is dated 22 March 2016 \u2013 nine days before a new stamp duty surcharge came into effect. Purpose-built flats on the same street as those bought by the Blairs have recently been marketed at \u00a375,000 to \u00a395,000 for a one-bedroom apartment. Before 1 April a purchase this size would not attract any tax, but since the stamp duty change it would mean an upfront tax charge of \u00a32,250 to \u00a32,850. The Blair family now own at least 31 flats and 10 houses in a property portfolio put together since Tony Blair left 10 Downing Street. Mark Stock, branch manager of the Bridgfords estate agents in Chorlton, said flats on the street were currently letting quickly. \u201cWe\u2019ve just let two of the properties that we had sold there within 24 hours,\u201d he said. \u201cA one-bedroom flat is letting for \u00a3500 a calendar month, which is a good return if you are paying \u00a385,000 to \u00a390,000.\u201d Stock said that buy-to-let investors were interested in the market. \u201cThe price is quite attractive \u2013 we\u2019ve had a lot of professional people buying to rent out, and a few overseas people who have been looking for a bolthole near the city.\u201d Tenants tend to be people working in the hospital nearby, he said, or those commuting into central Manchester. The latest properties to appear on Oldbury\u2019s filings are owned alongside 27 flats in Manchester and Stockport, bought for a total of just under \u00a32.2m and likely to be bringing in around \u00a313,500 a month in rent. Cherie and Euan each own half of the shares in the firm. The stamp duty surcharge was announced in November\u2019s autumn statement and came into effect on 1 April. It adds three percentage points to the tax paid by anyone buying a property as an investment or holiday home, and means anyone paying between \u00a340,000 and \u00a3125,000 for an investment property faces an upfront tax bill for the first time.

There\u2019s no shower or Austin Powers-style gyrating bed but you and 59 of your best mates can swap the overpriced paninis, Pringles and soft drinks of cattle class to party on your personal Ryanair plane. For a price the budget airline will even lay on \u201cfine dining\u201d, which for its first outing was a smorgasbord of fruit salad \u2013 complete with 1970s-style melon balls \u2013 smoked salmon and pastries and copious amounts of fizz, albeit prosecco rather than champagne.

But if you want to get a feel for what it\u2019s like to be Posh and Becks, wafting through international airports without ever being asked to join a queue or take off your shoes, this service probably isn\u2019t it. Departure gate 14 at Gatwick looked suspiciously like the one Ryanair flights normally depart from and ground staff seemed to have missed the memo explaining we were all VIPS. Ryanair believes the service will be popular with groups of friends travelling to sports events as well as schools and stag and hen parties. Pampered executives, used to gilded business class services, might not be tempted to trade down as there is still a budget feel to proceedings due to the disposable cutlery and plastic glasses. The toilet cubicle is decked out with a posy of flowers but the effect is spoiled somewhat by the company issue Ryanair handwash, which triples as a moisturiser and air freshener.

    "webTitle": "Tata Steel rules out any dowry to attract potential buyer", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tata has indicated it is not prepared to hand over a dowry to any buyer of its UK business, despite the Port Talbot steelworks needing hundreds of millions of pounds in new investment to survive. Financial sweeteners from Tata could help attract a saviour for its UK business, which is losing at least \u00a31m a day and has just weeks to secure its future. However, Koushik Chatterjee, group executive director of Tata Steel, said the Indian company did not provide a dowry as part of the deal to sell its Scunthorpe steelworks to Greybull, and is selling the rest of the business because it cannot afford the running costs. It is far from unusual for a seller to pay funds to buyers of a struggling business. BMW left a \u00a3500m dowry to the Phoenix Four when they bought MG Rover in 2000, mostly through an interest free loan, while the new owners of Comet were left with a \u00a350m sum in 2012. Chatterjee said Tata has offered \u201cfinancing lines\u201d to Greybull, the investment firm, such as the working capital already in the business. However, when asked about a dowry, he said: \u201cI think the whole idea is if there was a huge amount of financial appetite for us we would have not taken this strategic decision [to sell the UK business], so that is important to state. \u201cThe fact is that with the kind of losses and the capital commitments that are required, we have said in our releases on 29 March that the capital commitments for the near term and the long term are not something that the Tata board is able to afford to support, so I think that is important.\u201d Nonetheless, Tata is selling the Scunthorpe steelworks for a nominal fee \u2013 likely to be \u00a31 \u2013 and it has not put a price on the rest of the UK business in sales documents sent to buyers. \u201cIt depends on what offers come in,\u201d Chatterjee said. \u201cToday is the start of the process. If you really look at it, any asset or any business when it is sold, there is a consideration that is expected. That depends on what kind of offers we receive and the shape of the offers that we receive.\u201d Around 40,000 steelmaking and supply chain jobs are at risk after Tata announced last month that it plans to sell its UK operations, which include the Port Talbot steelworks, the biggest in the country. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has said the government could co-invest with a potential buyer, raising the prospect of the steel business being part-nationalised. Chatterjee said Tata decided to sell the business amid the steel industry\u2019s biggest crisis in 50 years. He said: \u201cToday I believe the steel industry globally is facing one of its worst existential crises in the last 50 years maybe, or at least the last 20, 25 years. That has created huge headwinds in our industry and that is something that cannot get sorted only by companies and corporations. \u201cYou need the environment to continue, you need the environment to support, because steel is so very important, basic and possibly a foundation industry for any economy. \u201cIt is important to understand that when these externalities become so much more high in terms of influence, companies have to take a strategic view on assets and investments. It is those things that have driven us to that decision.\u201d The Tata boss refused to criticise the UK government\u2019s handling of the crisis and said it was up to any buyer of its steel business to reach an agreement over state aid. \u201cWe hope the government supports the business in whatever form that the new buyer actually asks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to define what the government can do, it\u2019s between the government and the new buyer.\u201d The Tata steel business has pension liabilities of almost \u00a315bn, but Chatterjee said the scheme is \u201cwell-funded\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "IMF cuts global forecasts; oil jumps on deal report \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A jump in the oil price has fuelled a rise in European markets, which had previously been looking rather uncertain. Hopes of an agreement at the imminent meeting of oil producers in Doha, specifically suggestions that Russia and Saudi Arabia had agreed a freeze, sent crude prices to new highs for the year. Brent is currently 3.7% higher at $44.43 a barrel, having touched $44.73, while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is up 3.1% at $41.61. Oil has also been lifted by the weakness in the dollar, as investors bet there would not be an imminent rise in US interest rates. Meanwhile, optimism that the Chinese economy may be stabilising helped other commodities and pushed mining shares higher. The gloomy news from the International Monetary Fund, which cut its global growth forecasts, was pushed to one side. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 42.27 points or 0.68% at 6242.39 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.81% to 9761.47 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.77% to 4345.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.57% higher at 8546.3 But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB bucked the trend, falling 1.57% to 17,444.80 as the country\u2019s banks slipped back after recent gains on confirmation of a plan to restructure bad loans In Greece, the Athens market dipped 1.34% to 553.43 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 157 points or 0.9% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The IMF\u2019s growth forecasts still look too optimistic even though they have been downgraded, says Capital Economics: Despite being revised down yet again, we think the IMF\u2019s latest projections for global growth are still too high. This is partly because the IMF appears to be constrained by the official, government forecasts for China and India, but its projections for the US and the euro-zone also look too optimistic. Among advanced economies, the key differences [between the IMF and our forecasts] are that we are less optimistic about both the US and the euro-zone. With first-quarter growth in the US now likely to be only around 1.0%, the risks to our US forecast are to the downside. And for the euro-zone, the generally disappointing first-quarter data have supported our view that activity is likely to slow this year. Among emerging economies, we think growth in China will be around 5.5%. Note that although this is lower than official and IMF estimates, it would be an improvement compared to last year. For India, too, the difference between our projections and those of the IMF is partly due to uncertainty surrounding the official national accounts data. Finally, although Brazil and Russia\u2019s recessions both look set to continue this year, we expect them to be slightly less severe than is projected by the IMF. (A reminder that there were hopes of an agreement over the weekend.) More on the Greek situation: Oil prices were always going to be influenced by reports ahead of the producers\u2019 meeting, said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, but in practice, any output freeze at January levels may not bring the benefits expected. He said: Rumours of a deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia for a production freeze provided further gains for crude today amid a four-month high for Brent. This week was always likely to see market positioning in advance of the meeting, which has driven substantial gains across the energy sector. However, given that many of the world producers are pumping less than they did in January, a freeze could even increase the amount of crude being produced. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has said that two bills on pensions and taxes - sticking points in the discussions with the country\u2019s creditors - will be presented to parliament next week, Reuters in reporting. And - something to look forward to - he has also suggested there may be an extra Eurogroup meeting on 25 or 26 April. Earlier senior German government officials told Reuters that there could be no decision on any debt measures for Greece until the bailout review has been completed. The oil price increase is giving some support to stock markets, with the FTSE 100, Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac all climbing around 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 110 points or 0.6%. The positive moves come despite the gloomy noises coming from the International Monetary Fund which has cut its global growth forecasts again. Oil continues to strengthen, now helped by another report that key producers might agree a deal to tackle the supply glut, this time from news agency Interfax: Here\u2019s Reuters on the IMF\u2019s latest comments on Greece: The International Monetary Fund\u2019s chief economist said on Tuesday that Europe will need to show some flexibility towards Greece as it deals with a refugee crisis and negotiates a new bailout package. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly going to be a need for more flexibility to tackle the refugee crisis and some support from the broader European community,\u201d IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said in a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s a European problem, it\u2019s actually a global problem.\u201d He said the IMF has during its negotiations with Athens called for some debt relief, coupled with fiscal adjustments by the Greek government that would put the country on a path towards debt sustainability. The talks are on hold for the IMF-World Bank spring meetings this week in Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking a stand on each particular component. But we need a program that adds up,\u201d Obstfeld said. Here\u2019s a list of the recent Brexit polls: After its earlier strength on the back of higher than expected UK inflation figures, sterling has now fallen back as a new survey shows the campaign for Britain to leave the EU is in the lead. The pound is down almost half a cent to $1.431 as an ICM poll put leave on 45% and remain on 42%. The European Commission has now unveiled its tax proposals for large corporations. Jennifer Rankin writes: Multinational companies will be forced to disclose profits earned and taxes paid in Europe and the world\u2019s shadiest fiscal havens, under proposals announced on Tuesday by EU regulators. The European commission wants all large companies to publish a country-by-country breakdown of profits, taxes, employees and turnover in all 28 member states of the EU, as well as some of the most problematic tax havens. American and Chinese companies with a subsidiary in Europe would also be subject to the transparency drive, as the rules would hit all global corporations with a large presence in Europe. If agreed, the new disclosure requirements would shine a spotlight on some of the world\u2019s most powerful companies, including Apple, Google and Starbucks, which have been caught up in a public furore over their tax bills. Lord Hill, the European commissioner for financial services, said the new rules would give the public \u201ca clear idea of whether a large multinational is paying tax where they make their profits\u201d. The proposals would be good for competition, he said, by levelling the playing field between large corporations and smaller firms. \u201cBy using complicated tax arrangements, some multinationals can pay nearly a third less tax than companies that only operate in one country.\u201d The full story is here: The US should wait until inflation is stronger before raising rates, according to Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Patrick Harker. And negative interest rates, although legally and technically difficult, should not be taken off the table, he said, echoing comments earlier this year from Fed chair Janet Yellen. Harker told a local business group: Although I remain confident that inflation will return to the Committee\u2019s 2 percent target, my outlook sees it doing so only gradually... global headwinds point to some downside risks to my economic outlook. These considerations make me a bit more conservative in my approach to policy, at least in the very near term. Although I cannot give you a definitive path for how policy will evolve, it might prove prudent to wait until the inflation data are stronger before we undertake a second rate hike. So, I am approaching near-term policy more cautiously than I did a few months ago. That is part of being data dependent. And attentiveness to the data will be a key factor in all of my future policy recommendations as well. If financial headwinds dissipate quickly and inflation picks up a bit more aggressively, it will require a slightly more aggressive approach to policy. [But] it will take fewer rate hikes to attain neutrality in policy than it would have 15 years ago. By historical standards, that in itself implies a somewhat shallower path for interest rates than was typical of past recoveries. The IMF\u2019s economic counsellor Maurice Obstfeld has said there is a need for more flexibility between Europe and Greece to handle the refugee crisis and the debt situation. Bruce Springsteen, Paypal and now Deutsche Bank. The bank has added its name to the list of those protesting a controversial anti-LGBT law in North Carolina. It has frozen plans to create 250 new jobs at its Cary, North Carolina, operation after the state became the first in the US to enact legislation requiring people to use public bathrooms or locker rooms that match the gender on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. John Cryan, co-chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cWe take our commitment to building inclusive work environments seriously. We\u2019re proud of our operations and employees in Cary and regret that as a result of this legislation we are unwilling to include North Carolina in our US expansion plans for now. We very much hope that we can re-visit our plans to grow this location in the near future.\u201d The bank currently employs 900 people at Cary and said it was \u201ccommitted to sustaining that existing presence.\u201d Last week Springsteen cancelled a concert in North Carolina because of the new law, which critics say legalises discrimination. Bank of America and American Airlines, which are based in Charlotte, have condemned the law, while PayPal cancelled plans to open a new operation center in Charlotte. The IMF is worried about a new phase of the financial crisis, but its proposals to remedy the situation do not go far enough, writes Larry Elliott: The prospect of Brexit clearly scares the IMF. A vote to leave would, it says, have serious consequences not just for Britain and its EU partners but for the whole of the global economy. The Fund is twitchy. It can identify a number of different triggers that might possibly bring about a new, dangerous phase of the crisis \u2013 such as a sharper than expected slowdown in China, a collapse in emerging markets or a pandemic. But with little more than two months to go before the referendum, Brexit is the most immediate threat. But if the Fund is right in its assessment, something will trigger the crisis sooner or later even if Britain decides to remain a member of the EU. The IMF says global growth has been too slow for too long, and proposes a mix of expansionary monetary policy (low interest rates and quantitative easing), higher spending on infrastructure and research and development, and structural reforms to boost productivity. This, though, seems a bit timid if the Fund is right in its analysis that globalisation benefits the few not the many and that a rising tide no longer lifts all boats. In that case, the remedy would not be more R&amp;D spending but checks on financial speculation and more aggressive redistribution. Global growth has indeed been too slow for too long. The Fund\u2019s remedy is too little too late. His full analysis is here: Ahead of its spring meeting the International Monetary Fund has, as expected, cut its forecasts for global growth, at the same time as warning on the risks of Britain leaving the European Union. Katie Allen and Anushka Asthana write: A British vote to leave the EU risks causing severe economic and political damage to Europe that will spill over into an already febrile world economy, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Cutting its forecasts for global growth and for the UK and other advanced economies, the IMF listed a potential Brexit vote in June\u2019s EU referendum as a key risk in its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO)... The IMF now predicts global GDP growth will edge up only slightly this year, to 3.2%, from growth of 3.1% in 2015. That compared with a 2016 forecast of 3.4% in a January update and of 3.6% in the last WEO in October. The 2017 forecast was cut to 3.5% from, 3.6% in January... The IMF cut its forecast for UK GDP growth this year. After growing 2.2% in 2015, the economy was now expected to expand 1.9% in 2016, down from a forecast of 2.2% made by the Fund in January. That compares with 2.0% growth predicted for 2016 by the government\u2019s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility. The IMF left its forecast for 2017 growth unchanged at 2.2%. The full story is here: US import prices rose in March by 0.2% after a revised 0.4% drop in the previous month. The increase came following a rise in the cost of petroleum products, but it was less than the 1% expected by analysts. Brent crude has climbed above $43 a barrel on hopes that next week\u2019s meeting of oil producers can agree to freeze output to tackle the current supply glut. Iraqi oil official Falah Alamri said he was confident that the meeting with Opec and other producers in Doha would reach an agreement. Oil is also being supported by hopes that the Chinese economy is stabilising after a rise in vehicle sales. On top of that, the weak dollar is helping commodities. The gap between UK inflation and average earnings is narrowing: MPs are about to start an emergency debate on the crisis in the UK steel industry. My colleague Andrew Sparrow will be following proceedings in the politics live blog: The dollar has fallen to an eight month low against a basket of currencies as investors continue to bet that the Federal Reserve is in no hurry to raise US interest rates. Meanwhile sterling has climbed to its highest level in more than a week after the higher than expected UK inflation figures. The pound is up around half a percent at $1.4313 after the data, which suggested that UK rates could rise more quickly than people had been expecting. Greece\u2019s inability to wrap up negotiations with creditors last night has fuelled fears that the talks could drag on until the early summer, potentially coinciding with Britain\u2019s referendum on EU membership. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, reports: Another deadline marked; another deadline missed. Tortuous talks to complete the first review under debt-stricken Greece\u2019s third international bailout are beginning to resemble the momentum that triggered crunch time in 2015. Despite the positive face put on by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who emerged in the early hours to say that progress had been made, there is no hiding the divide that still exists between Athens and the foreign lenders keeping the country afloat. As the straight-talking Oxford-educated finance minister himself admitted: \u201cbecause there are many other small [issues] we did not have the time to discuss it became obvious to all of us that it was not possible to have a staff level agreement by day break today.\u201d Disagreement over non performing loans and pension reforms still linger but beyond discord over Athens\u2019 ability to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % by 2018, it is the much bigger disagreement over debt relief that has come to cloud the talks. The inability of Berlin and the International Monetary Fund to see eye-to-eye on the matter is unlikely to be resolved soon. Even if Greek officials manage to put the final touches to a deal that would effectively conclude the process later this week at the IMF\u2019s spring meetings in Washington DC, in Athens almost no one believes in a similar breakthrough on the crucial issue of debt relief. Without debt forgiveness, few have faith in the shattered Greek economy ever recovering. While the IMF continues to advocate a debt haircut, EU member states led by Berlin have hinted that, at most, a reduction would come in the form of longer maturities and grace periods. In private, leading members of the leftist led government are holding out the hope that Europe\u2019s refugee emergency \u2013 and Greece\u2019s frontline role \u2013 will help cut it some slack. \u201cBut that line of thought could backfire in so many ways,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at the University of Athens. \u201cFirst of all from the far right that will exploit anti-immigrant sentiment while the trade off of less reforms for more refugees will, quite rightly, never be accepted by the IMF.\u201d If the talks aren\u2019t concluded by May, Greece, will, once again, face a ferocious liquidity problem just when it confronts \u20ac5bn worth of debt repayments in June and July (money it does not have) and the UK is gearing up for its in-out EU referendum. Newsflash: Saudi Arabia\u2019s credit rating has just been cut by one notch, to AA-, by Fitch. Fitch also left Saudi Arabia with a negative outlook, meaning further cuts are possible. It cited the \u201cnegative implications\u201d of cheaper oil on the country\u2019s fiscal stability, and also pointed to rising tensions with Iran. Has peace broken out at the European Central Bank, between president Mario Draghi and his more hawkish colleague Jens Weidmann? Weidmann, who heads up Germany\u2019s central bank, has leapt to Draghi\u2019s defence against critics - including many Germans \u2013 who oppose his monetary easing and record low interest rates. Speaking to the Financial Times, Weidmann argues (persuasively) that it\u2019s too simplistic to just talk about \u2018savers\u2019 suffering from low borrowing costs. Employees, taxpayers, and anyone with debts are benefitting from the current situation. Weidmann is understood to have opposed some of Draghi\u2019s attempts to stimulate growth and inflation in the euro area. But he\u2019s adamant that politicians should keep their noses out: \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for politicians to have opinions on monetary policy, but we are independent,\u201d \u201cThe ECB has to deliver on its price stability mandate and thus an expansionary monetary policy stance is appropriate at this juncture regardless of different views about specific measures.\u201d More here: Bundesbank\u2019s Weidmann rebukes Draghi critics in Berlin This might ruffle some feathers in Berlin. Last Friday, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble blamed Draghi for the rise of the eurosceptic AfD party, and declared that central banks should raise interest rates..... British house continue to outpace both the headline inflation rate and average earnings. New figures show that UK house prices increased by 7.6% in the year to February 2016. That\u2019s down from 7.9% in the year to January 2016: Once again, strong demand in London (+9.7%) and the South East (+11.4%) drove the market, while other regions were more subdued. House price annual inflation was 8.2% in England, 2.8% in Wales, -0.8% in Scotland and 2.4% in Northern Ireland. Here\u2019s our news story about the rise in UK inflation in March: The recent weakness in the pound, which has fallen 6% since last October, has also pushed inflation higher (by driving up the cost of imports). Dimitris Hiotis, partner at pricing experts Simon-Kucher &amp; Partner, reckons this trend could continue ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. With the judgement day on Brexit looming, the sterling has continued to depreciate in recent months, which has increased the cost of imports to the country. As we move closer to the referendum on June 23rd, and with the latest polls showing it to be a close run race, we expect sterling to depreciate further and therefore cause additional inflationary pressures in the coming months. The Institute of Directors (whose members largely oppose Brexit) agrees. IoD chief economist Michael Martins argues: \u201cThe slight rise in inflation is likely connected to depreciation of the pound as uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum increases and international investors begin to sell off sterling. This is not a one-month phenomenon \u2013 core inflation, which strips out volatile factors like energy and food, increased to 1.5% in March, after averaging 1.1% over the last 8 months. \u201cWhile the Bank of England has been keen to see prices rising as a spur to economic growth, if pay rises do not shadow increased inflation, real wages will decline, putting pressure on people\u2019s wallets and holding back increases in productivity. Real wage increases are now under 2% (1.9%), running just ahead of core inflation. This rise in inflation doesn\u2019t mean that the UK economy is healed, argues TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady: \u201cDespite a small rise, the overall picture is still of very low inflation. It indicates that the economy is still not at full strength, with too much underemployment and too little wage growth. \u201cWith the global economy slowing down, the government cannot just sit by. We need investment in skills, infrastructure and public services to promote growth for the long term.\u201d Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), has urged the Bank of England to resist any temptation to raise interest rates at this week\u2019s meeting. He reckons his members have enough on their collective plates: \u201cSmall firms are currently dealing with a raft of challenges, including the National Living Wage which came into effect this month, driving up costs and driving down modest profit. A recent FSB survey showed small business confidence hovering at its lowest level since 2013. Despite inflation edging up last month, our members welcome this ongoing period of low inflation which has helped to keep other operating costs manageable. Economists are split over when the Bank of England might take the plunge and raise interest rates, now that inflation is creeping towards its 2% target. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, reckons the BoE is \u201cmiles away from raising rates\u201d, given the state of the UK economy. Stewart argues: The Bank\u2019s big problem is sustaining growth and getting inflation up. \u201cInflation may have bottomed, but the mounting risks in the global economy, and the continued risk of deflation, means that interest rates are likely to stay on hold until next year.\u201d But Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg reckons the first hike could come in November - unless Britain votes to leave the EU, of course. Looking ahead, we expect the headline rate to increase to 1.6% by the final quarter of the year. Beyond the modest dent to GDP growth in the first half of this year as a result of the financial market rout and Brexit uncertainty, underlying fundamentals point to robust growth at around trend (0.5% qoq) in the second half of the year driven by strong consumer spending and recovering business investment. The on-going acceleration in inflation, alongside consumer credit growth at a decade high, household saving at a historic low and the labour market at full employment begs the question if near-zero rates are still appropriate. Indeed, data for household spending, borrowing and saving point to some overheating in the domestic economy. Therefore, as long as the UK votes to stay in the EU we expect the Bank of England to hike rates by 25 bps in November. We see a 35% chance of a Brexit. Confused about how inflation is calculated? Or wondering why some economists have been fretting about deflation? Our video explainer has the answers... You can see the inflation report here, on the Office for National Statistics website. Today\u2019s rise in inflation may undermine the notion that UK interest rates could stay on hold until 2020. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics certainly thinks so, saying: Inflation pressures are continuing to build, challenging the consensus view in the markets that the MPC will leave interest rates on hold until the end of the decade. The rise in the headline rate entirely reflected an increase in core inflation to 1.5%, from 1.2% in February. About half this increase came from airfares, the rest from stronger inflation in the clothing and restaurant sectors. Airfares were reportedly boosted by Easter in late March, but we have our doubts that all of their rise is temporary. Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, also believes the Bank of England will sit tight at this week\u2019s monetary policy meeting. Naturally policymakers will need to remain mindful of the risk that inflation overshoots at some point. However, the UK economy is battling a number of significant headwinds at present. Consumer spending, aided by low inflation, low unemployment and rising wages, has been the engine of economic growth lately. But recent surveys suggest consumers reined in their spending in March - perhaps the first sign of nerves ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. All in all, the economic picture remains highly uncertain and I expect no action from Threadneedle Street for some time yet. Britain\u2019s inflation rate is still far too low to prompt an interest rate rise, says Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International: Today\u2019s increase is unlikely to spur the Bank of England into considering raising interest rates on Thursday with widespread consensus that this week will see the 85th consecutive month that the bank keeps interest rates on hold at their emergency level of 0.50%. Bloomberg columnist Mark Gilbert is struck by the surge in air fares last month. Here\u2019s some details from today\u2019s UK inflation report: Transport: prices, overall, rose by 1.7% between February and March this year compared with a rise of 0.7% between the same 2 months a year ago. By far the largest upward effect came from air transport where the timing of Easter contributed to fares rising by 22.9% between February and March 2016. Fares rose by 2.7% between the same 2 months in 2015. There was also a smaller upward effect from rail passenger transport with fares rising this year but falling a year ago. These upward effects were partially offset by a downward contribution from motor fuels with petrol prices rising by 0.9 pence per litre this year compared with a larger rise of 3.8 pence per litre a year ago. Clothing and footwear: prices, overall, rose by 1.0% between February and March this year compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Last year was the first time that prices had fallen between February and March since the CPI started in 1996. Normally they rise as they continue to recover following the January sales period. The upward contribution this year came from price movements across a range of women\u2019s outerwear. Restaurants and hotels: prices, overall, rose by 0.5% between February and March 2016 compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward effect came principally from restaurant and caf\u00e9 prices rising by more than a year ago. After falling into negative territory last year, Britain\u2019s inflation rate has now moved towards the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target: And this chart confirms that higher air fares cancelled out the impact of cheaper fuel. The pound has jumped by over half a cent against the US dollar, to around $1.43. Traders are calculating that higher-than-expected inflation figures could mean UK interest rates rise earlier than expected. Britain\u2019s core inflation rate, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, has hit 1.5%. That\u2019s the highest rate since October 2014, indicating that inflationary pressures are building. The early Easter holiday has helped to push inflation up. Holiday air fares rose in March compared to 2015 (when Easter was later). This is the highest UK inflation rate since December 2014, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index anyway. Breaking: Britain\u2019s annual inflation rate has jumped to 0.5% for March, up from 0.3% in February. That beats forecasts of a smaller rise, to 0.4%. More to follow..... The IMF has already cut its forecasts for growth this year several times, as RBS\u2019s economist team point out. Today\u2019s World Economic Outlook, due at 2pm BST, may include further gloom. Hopes that Greece and its creditors could make a breakthrough have been dashed overnight, probably to no-one\u2019s great surprise. Talks between the two sides were adjourned early this morning, and will resume next week once the IMF\u2019s Spring Meeting has concluded. Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters that: \u201cThe Greek government and the four institutions agreed there was progress,\u201d But clearly not enough progress to allow the first review of Greece\u2019s bailout to be wrapped up. There are still significant differences between the two sides, on issues such as pension reform and how to tackle bad loans. Tsakalotos says they\u2019re hoping for a deal by April 22nd. Endless talks. Delays. Postponements. It\u2019s all sounding a bit 2015.... Tax avoidance by multinational corporations will be forced into the open under proposals to be unveiled by European regulators later today following the Panama Papers revelations. The European commission will put forward legislation requiring large multinationals operating in Europe to disclose where they make profits and where they pay tax on a country by country basis. Companies trading in Europe, including large subsidiaries of non-European businesses, would also have to publish how much tax they pay outside the EU with specific information about tax paid in problematic jurisdictions..... Here\u2019s the full story: Shares in luxury goods makers are sliding across Europe this morning, following disappointing results from France\u2019s LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE. Last night, LVMH warned that last November\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris had hit sales in the last quarter. It reported a 4% rise in sales to \u20ac8.62bn; analysts had expected \u20ac8.73bn. LVMH, which owns champagne house Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon and cognac label Hennessy, as well as Louis Vuitton, told shareholders: \u201cThe U.S. market is strong and Europe remains well oriented except for France which is affected by a fall in tourism.\u201d LVMH\u2019s shares have fallen by 3.5% this morning, while Hermes has lost 1.5% and Burberry has shed 1.7%. Troubled UK supermarket chain Tesco has cut back one of its overseas ventures, as it looks to bolster its position back home. Tesco has sold an 8.6% stake in southeast Asian online retailer Lazada to China\u2019s Alibaba Group, raising just over \u00a390m (and giving Alibaba a controlling stake). That could give CEO Dave Lewis a little more firepower for price cuts, in his battle against discount supermarkets. The City isn\u2019t too impressed, though - Tesco\u2019s shares are down 1.6%. London\u2019s stock market has opened cautiously, with the FTSE 100 index dropping by 8 points in early trading. Mining shares are up, partly helped by the weaker dollar. But retailers are falling after a new survey showed that sales fell last month, as wet weather put shoppers off. Jack Lew, the US treasury secretary, has turned the tables on the International Monetary Fund by arguing that it must do more to help the global economy recover. Lew called out the IMF in a speech last night, saying it must be \u2018modernised\u2019. He urged it to: ...intensify scrutiny of critical issues like exchange rates, current account imbalances, and shortfalls in global aggregate demand In other words, he wants the Fund to criticise countries who fuel currency wars or destabilise the global economy by running large trade deficits [such as Britain] or surpluses [Germany, perhaps]. Quite a challenge to the IMF, which likes to use its Spring Meetings to tell everyone else whet they\u2019re doing wrong. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has poured cold water on hopes that a global tax authority could be introduced, to combat tax evasion. Speaking in Washington overnight, she warned that the idea of an intergovernmental UN tax body \u2013 promoted by Oxfam \u2013 faced major obstacles from governments. Lagarde argues: \u201cWe need to be aware of the massive hurdles and obstacles along the way because taxation for the last century or so has been defined, conceptualised, designed, implemented on a purely territorial sovereign basis. And if anything, levying taxation is considered as an attribute of sovereignty, and anything that takes away from that is going to be very strongly opposed by many countries in the world, many forces.\u201d Having said that, Lagarde concedes that the current situation really won\u2019t do. \u201cI think it\u2019s an area where we all have to think outside the box because there are too many boxes in that tax field and thinking outside the box might be of great interest.\u201d More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s an important week for the global economy, as policymakers head to Washington for the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The IMF will be setting the scene today, with its latest World Economic Outlook (at 2pm London time) \u2013 and it\u2019s likely to warn that economic conditions have weakened again. Economists expect the Fund to downgrade its growth forecasts, along with another warning that governments must do more to improve economic conditions. We also get the latest UK inflation figures at 9.30am BST. Inflation remains a rare and illusive beast in advanced economies, but analysts reckon the UK consumer prices index could rise to 0.4%, from 0.3%. A stronger reading might give the pound a lift. We\u2019ll also be watching Italy, where the government has just hammered out a \u20ac5bn fund to support its weaker banks. It also committed to improving bankruptcy rules, to make it quicker and easier to resolve a failing business. Officials are hoping that the plan will ease concerns over the stability of the Italian banking sector, following sharp declines in bank shares recently. And tax is also on the agenda. The European Commission is expected to announce plans to force multinational companies in Europe to reveal all their profits, and tax bills, filed in offshore havens. The plan, which has been in the works for months, has been given renewed impetus by the recent Panama Papers revelations. Here\u2019s a preview:",

A vote to leave would, it says, have serious consequences not just for Britain and its EU partners but for the whole of the global economy. The Fund is twitchy. It can identify a number of different triggers that might possibly bring about a new, dangerous phase of the crisis \u2013 such as a sharper than expected slowdown in China, a collapse in emerging markets or a pandemic. But with little more than two months to go before the referendum, Brexit is the most immediate threat.</p> <p>But if the Fund is right in its assessment, something will trigger the crisis sooner or later even if Britain decides to remain a member of the EU. The IMF says global growth has been too slow for too long, and proposes a mix of expansionary monetary policy (low interest rates and quantitative easing), higher spending on infrastructure and research and development, and structural reforms to boost productivity.</p> <p>This, though, seems a bit timid if the Fund is right in its analysis that globalisation benefits the few not the many and that a rising tide no longer lifts all boats. In that case, the remedy would not be more R&amp;D spending but checks on financial speculation and more aggressive redistribution. Global growth has indeed been too slow for too long.

Tortuous talks to complete the first review under debt-stricken Greece\u2019s third international bailout are beginning to resemble the momentum that triggered crunch time in 2015. Despite the positive face put on by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who emerged in the early hours to say that progress had been made, there is no hiding the divide that still exists between Athens and the foreign lenders keeping the country afloat.</p> <p>As the straight-talking Oxford-educated finance minister himself admitted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cbecause there are many other small [issues] we did not have the time to discuss it became obvious to all of us that it was not possible to have a staff level agreement by day break today.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Disagreement over non performing loans and pension reforms still linger but beyond discord over Athens\u2019 ability to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % by 2018, it is the much bigger disagreement over debt relief that has come to cloud the talks. The inability of Berlin and the International Monetary Fund to see eye-to-eye on the matter is unlikely to be resolved soon.</p> <p>Even if Greek officials manage to put the final touches to a deal that would effectively conclude the process later this week at the IMF\u2019s spring meetings in Washington DC, in Athens almost no one believes in a similar breakthrough on the crucial issue of debt relief. Without debt forgiveness, few have faith in the shattered Greek economy ever recovering. While the IMF continues to advocate a debt haircut, EU member states led by Berlin have hinted that, at most, a reduction would come in the form of longer maturities and grace periods.</p> <p>In private, leading members of the leftist led government are holding out the hope that Europe\u2019s refugee emergency \u2013 and Greece\u2019s frontline role \u2013 will help cut it some slack.</p> <p>\u201cBut that line of thought could backfire in so many ways,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at the University of Athens.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFirst of all from the far right that will exploit anti-immigrant sentiment while the trade off of less reforms for more refugees will, quite rightly, never be accepted by the IMF.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>If the talks aren\u2019t concluded by May, Greece, will, once again, face a ferocious liquidity problem just when it confronts \u20ac5bn worth of debt repayments in June and July (money it does not have) and the UK is gearing up for its in-out EU referendum. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisMouzakis/status/719840789648375809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a>&#39;s 2016 debt obligations <a href=\"https://t.co/uqXMoeoCr4\">pic.twitter.com/uqXMoeoCr4</a></p>&mdash; Yiannis Mouzakis (@YiannisMouzakis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisMouzakis/status/719840789648375809\">April 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T11:33:00.264Z\">at 12.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-570cd444e4b00591e8dc8a62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T10:58:16.399Z\">11.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash: Saudi Arabia\u2019s credit rating has just been cut by one notch, to AA-, by Fitch.</strong></p> <p>Fitch also left Saudi Arabia with a negative outlook, meaning further cuts are possible.</p> <p>It cited the \u201cnegative implications\u201d of cheaper oil on the country\u2019s fiscal stability, and also pointed to rising tensions with Iran.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/719840841905369089\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Saudi Arabia ratings cut by Fitch, which says outlook remains negative <a href=\"https://t.co/wx9kCQwAFW\">https://t.co/wx9kCQwAFW</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hdRW81pEih\">pic.twitter.com/hdRW81pEih</a></p>&mdash; Bloomberg (@business) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/719840841905369089\">April 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-570cd146e4b00591e8dc8a58\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-12T10:53:32.955Z\">11.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB's Weidmann defends Draghi</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"07d0814dc6fa3858edb9825faaa43df5d379043c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d0814dc6fa3858edb9825faaa43df5d379043c/0_0_3500_1730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The President of the Deutsche Bundesbank (German Central Bank) Jens Weidmann.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"494\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Has peace broken out at the European Central Bank, between president Mario Draghi and his more hawkish colleague Jens Weidmann?</strong></p> <p>Weidmann, who heads up Germany\u2019s central bank, has leapt to Draghi\u2019s defence against critics - including many Germans \u2013 who oppose his monetary easing and record low interest rates.</p> <p>Speaking to the Financial Times, Weidmann argues (persuasively) that it\u2019s too simplistic to just talk about \u2018savers\u2019 suffering from low borrowing costs.

However, the UK economy is battling a number of significant headwinds at present. Consumer spending, aided by low inflation, low unemployment and rising wages, has been the engine of economic growth lately.

Fares rose by 2.7% between the same 2 months in 2015.</p> <p>There was also a smaller upward effect from rail passenger transport with fares rising this year but falling a year ago. These upward effects were partially offset by a downward contribution from motor fuels with petrol prices rising by 0.9 pence per litre this year compared with a larger rise of 3.8 pence per litre a year ago.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Clothing and footwear: </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>prices, overall, rose by 1.0% between February and March this year compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Last year was the first time that prices had fallen between February and March since the CPI started in 1996. Normally they rise as they continue to recover following the January sales period. The upward contribution this year came from price movements across a range of women\u2019s outerwear.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Restaurants and hotels: </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>prices, overall, rose by 0.5% between February and March 2016 compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago.

to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s an important week for the global economy, as policymakers head to Washington for the Spring meetings of the <strong>International Monetary Fund</strong> and the <strong>World Bank</strong>.</p> <p>The IMF will be setting the scene today, with its latest World Economic Outlook (<em>at 2pm London time</em>) \u2013 and it\u2019s likely to warn that economic conditions have weakened again. </p> <p>Economists expect the Fund to downgrade its growth forecasts, along with another warning that governments must do more to improve economic conditions.</p> <p><strong>We also get the latest UK inflation figures at 9.30am BST. </strong></p> <p><strong>Inflation </strong>remains a rare and illusive beast in advanced economies, but analysts reckon the UK consumer prices index could rise to 0.4%, from 0.3%. A stronger reading might give the pound a lift.</p> <p>We\u2019ll also be watching <strong>Italy</strong>, where the government has just hammered out a \u20ac5bn fund to support its weaker banks. It also committed to improving bankruptcy rules, to make it quicker and easier to resolve a failing business.</p> <p>Officials are hoping that the plan will ease concerns over the stability of the Italian banking sector, following sharp declines in bank shares recently.</p> <p>And <strong>tax</strong> is also on the agenda. The European Commission is expected to announce plans to force multinational companies in Europe to reveal all their profits, and tax bills, filed in offshore havens.</p> <p>The plan, which has been in the works for months, has been given renewed impetus by the recent Panama Papers revelations.

      "bodyText": "Public confidence in governments\u2019 ability to make sure big business contributes its fair share in corporate income tax has been blown to smithereens in recent years. One of the most persuasive solutions on the table is enforced transparency. In a week in which David Cameron has published details of his tax records, why shouldn\u2019t public companies with a chequered track record \u2013 Google, Starbucks, Vodafone and others \u2013 be made to disclose more too? A seemingly constant stream of tax scandals involving these and many other of the world\u2019s best-known multinational corporations has exposed the way big business has become increasingly aggressive in its international tax planning. The LuxLeaks revelations two years ago further demonstrated how, in equally aggressive fashion, it is possible for European member states \u2013 not just offshore tax havens \u2013 to tailor their tax policies to court multinationals hungry for tax favours. The result is a betrayal of the trust between countries that are meant to underpin international trade. Pliant states have struck private deals with powerful multinationals, creating colossal artificial flows of income across borders and eroding the tax take of their neighbours. It is a scandal costing the world economy hundreds of billions of dollars a year. According to the most conservative estimates from the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), between 4% and 10% of global corporate income tax revenues are being lost to tax avoidance. The EU alone says its member states lose each year between \u20ac50bn and \u20ac70bn (\u00a339.9bn and \u00a355.8bn) to those avoiding corporation tax. It estimates that multinationals can pay up to 30% less than rival companies which do not operate across borders. In October last year, world leaders representing 90% of the world\u2019s economy agreed to a raft of measures, thrashed out through an OECD tax reform programme, designed to stamp out the most egregious tax avoidance practices among multinationals. Top of the list was a requirement for big businesses to produce so-called country-by-country reports. These reports \u2013 to be shared only with tax inspectors \u2013 provide a schedule of business and tax information, itemised by jurisdiction. Many tax campaigners believe country-by-country reports will become the most powerful tool for exposing the mismatch between where big businesses are most commercially active and where their income is taxed. Finding and defeating this artifice is at the heart of the battle against avoidance. On Tuesday, the European commission revealed a new proposal it said goes further than the OECD reforms. As revealed in the Guardian in February, the commission is promising to make all large corporations active in the EU publish some data from their country-by-country reports in the public domain. That means fresh tax data on most of the world\u2019s largest multinationals will be publicly available, broken down by each member state. While the proposal stops short of demanding data for non-EU jurisdictions \u2013 much to the frustration of those campaigning for tax justice in the developing world \u2013 it will extend to recognised tax havens, a list of which has yet to be thrashed out. The new reporting rules will apply to multinationals with a turnover of more than \u20ac750m \u2013 estimated to be at least 6,000 multinationals, two-thirds of which are thought to be headquartered outside the EU. Unveiling the new measures, Valdis Dombrovskis, commissioner for social dialogue said: \u201cClose cooperation between tax authorities must go hand in hand with public transparency.\u201d Jonathan Hill, the European commissioner for financial stability, added: \u201cOur proposal to increase transparency will help make companies more accountable.\u201d However, the proposal comes amid fierce lobbying from business interest groups, particularly in the US, where the National Association of Manufacturers has led calls for Washington to resist disclosures of what it called \u201csensitive, proprietary business information\u201d. NAM members include many US multinationals. On Tuesday, Dorothy Coleman, NAM spokeswoman on tax, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to conclude this is part of a move by Europe towards more aggressive tax audits, going beyond internationally accepted tax norms. And it is US companies that are very much in the crosshairs.\u201d She added: \u201cThe public is not well placed to analyse this kind of information and we are concerned it will be misused or misunderstood.\u201d The European commission insists it has listened to business groups and has carefully crafted the public reporting standards so as not to impinge on competitiveness. Officials in Brussels point out, for example, that publicly available information will be far less than the full data set that multinationals must provide to the tax authorities. Indeed, the commission concedes the new public report will do little more than provide in a single document information that is already largely available on company registers in each member state. That raises the question whether this is all more for political effect than substantive reform. Certainly, in the UK, George Osborne appeared to have discovered an enthusiasm for public country-by-country reporting only belatedly \u2013 and after a furore around HMRC\u2019s controversial tax settlement with Google led to a barrage of criticism. Ultimately, as with all complex international tax reforms, the true test will be whether the commission\u2019s latest proposals will end the toxic tax behaviour now so deeply ingrained in the business models of most of the world\u2019s largest corporations.",

The mutual has appointed the investment bank Rothschild to find prospective buyers for the shops, which equate to nearly 10% of its estate, as it tries to keep a lid on debt and expand and modernise its successful convenience store business. Last week the Co-op revealed that sales at established convenience stores had increased by 3.8% in the year to 2 January, more than double the pace of the Co-op food business as a whole.

      "bodyText": "The UK blocked tougher EU trade rules to help the steel industry partly because it could have raised the price of shoes for British shoppers, Sajid Javid has said. The business secretary argued the UK opposed scrapping the so-called lesser duty rule as it would have \u201ccost British shoppers dear\u201d, including an extra \u00a3130m a year on the price of footwear \u2013 the equivalent of about \u00a34.80 for each household. A number of EU countries have been trying to get the rule lifted, as it would allow higher tariffs to be imposed on cut-price Chinese steel being dumped on the world market. The industry, Labour MPs and unions have blamed Chinese dumping for the crisis facing the steel industry, which has led Tata to announce it is withdrawing from the UK, risking tens of thousands of jobs. During an emergency debate in the House of Commons, Javid said the UK would consider supporting higher tariffs on steel at an EU level and would keep the evidence under constant review. But he defended the UK\u2019s commitment to the lesser duty rule \u2013 a principle whereby tariffs on all industries are imposed at the lowest level possible to deter dumping in trade disputes. A BIS source said Javid had been using shoes as an example of \u201chow the lesser duty rule can help \u2013 there were tariffs in place on shoes in 2007 until 2011\u201d, adding that the lesser duty has also saved UK consumers money on everything from solar panels, to candles, ironing boards and petrol. Labour has said scrapping the lesser duty rule in Brussels could allow duties on steel to be lifted much higher. Javid said: \u201cI hear a lot in this House about ideology but I am interested in one thing and that\u2019s what actually works. Where the evidence shows that tariffs against unfair trade will make a difference without harming British businesses and British consumers, I will always support them. \u201cThe opposition has repeatedly raised the lesser duty rule but it is something that they had no problem with for many years while they were in government. Scrapping the rule would cost British shoppers dear. It would be raising prices on everyday items we rely on. On footwear, the rule saved British shoppers \u00a3130m in one year alone. However, I am more than happy to look at ways of specifically helping the steel industry.\u201d During the debate, Javid was accused by Labour of an excessively laissez-faire approach to the steel industry. He defended the government\u2019s actions and hinted that moves to procure more British steel for defence projects could be announced in the coming days. On Monday, he raised the prospect of a \u201cco-investment\u201d with a commercial buyer in Tata Steel\u2019s largest plant in Port Talbot, south Wales. Asked to clarify what this meant, he did not rule out an equity investment, which would amount to part-nationalisation. \u201cThe key point is that any co-investment would have to be on commercial terms, investment can take a variety of forms, for example it could be debt,\u201d he said. \u201cBut again it\u2019s a demonstration of all the options the government is looking at.\u201d Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cCall it what you like, co-investing, part-nationalisation, temporary public stewardship or sheltering the assets, it\u2019s clear that the circumstances may require the government to do this. They should spare their ideological blushes and just get on with it.\u201d Asked by Geraint Davies, Labour MP for Swansea West, whether the government would \u201csocialise\u201d Tata\u2019s pension fund, Javid said: \u201cWe are looking at all possible solutions.\u201d Javid has come under particular criticism during the crisis for going to Australia for a trade trip and short holiday at the time of a board meeting to decide Tata\u2019s future in the UK. He has since been to India to discuss options for the sale of Tata\u2019s UK assets with the company. On Tuesday, Prince William also raised the plight of the British steel industry during lunch with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.",

    "webTitle": "Europe pressures multinationals to declare taxes and profits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Multinational companies will be forced to disclose profits earned and taxes paid in Europe and the world\u2019s shadiest fiscal havens, under proposals announced by EU regulators. The European commission said on Tuesday it wanted all large companies to publish a country-by-country breakdown of profits, taxes, employees and turnover in all 28 member states of the EU, as well as some of the most problematic tax havens. American and Chinese companies with subsidiaries in Europe would also be subject to the transparency drive, as the rules would apply to all global corporations with a large presence in Europe. If agreed, the new disclosure requirements would shine a spotlight on some of the world\u2019s most powerful companies, including Apple, Google and Starbucks, which have been caught up in a public furore over their tax bills. Jonathan Hill, the European commissioner for financial services, said the rules would give the public \u201ca clear idea of whether a large multinational is paying tax where they make their profits\u201d. The proposals would be good for competition by levelling the playing field between large corporations and smaller firms, Lord Hill said. \u201cBy using complicated tax arrangements, some multinationals can pay nearly a third less tax than companies that only operate in one country. It\u2019s not right that smaller companies should be at a competitive disadvantage to multinationals.\u201d George Osborne, who published his tax return on Monday after mounting public pressure, welcomed the proposals as a step in the right direction. \u201cOur view is simple \u2013 the UK will have among the most competitive business taxes in the world, but these taxes must be paid,\u201d the chancellor said. The creation of an EU blacklist of tax havens could be a sensitive issue for the British government. Last year the Treasury criticised the commission\u2019s first attempt at drawing up a list of \u201cnon-co-operative tax jurisdictions\u201d as \u201cmisleading and deeply unhelpful\u201d. The list included several British overseas territories, including Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. The legislation was first drawn up amid growing evidence that large corporations, from Amazon to Vodafone, were paying little tax despite earning healthy profits. Governments in the EU lose up to \u20ac70bn (\u00a356bn) a year through corporate tax avoidance, according to the European parliament. But as the Guardian reported on Friday, the proposals were hastily rewritten to target fiscal havens, as a result of the the leak from Panama of 11.5m files exposing the tax secrets of the global elite. \u201cThe Panama papers have not changed our agenda,\u201d Hill said, \u201cbut they have strengthened our determination to ensure that taxes are paid where profits are generated.\u201d Under the plans all multinationals with a turnover greater than \u20ac750m would be obliged to meet tougher standards on public disclosure. Around 6,500 companies would be affected, including around 4,000 subsidiaries of global corporations headquartered outside the EU. The proposals can still be amended as they go through the EU\u2019s lengthy legislative process; the final law will have to be agreed by a qualified majority of EU ministers and the European parliament. Under the fastest possible scenario, the rules will not come into force until 2018, meaning the first company reports would be published in 2019 after the end of the tax year. One obstacle is that the EU does not have an official list of tax havens, although commission officials have promised that one will be ready within six months. A list of 30 \u201cnon-co-operative tax jurisdictions\u201d, which included Panama and the British Virgin Islands, was published by the commission last year, but later withdrawn after it was derided by some member states. The British government does not have a list of tax havens and criticised the list as unhelpful. Officials in Brussels are counting on public outrage generated by the Panama Papers to help them reach a speedy agreement on both the proposals and the blacklist. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner in charge of tax policy, said: \u201cAfter the Panama Papers, there must not be a single hesitation from anybody that we need country-by-country reporting.\u201d Transparency campaigners said, however, that the proposals did not go far enough. A group of NGOs, including Oxfam and Action Aid, said the changes \u201cmake it impossible to effectively combat tax havens that have been at the centre of scandals\u201d. \u201cThe European commission\u2019s piecemeal proposals are not enough to end tax dodging that robs the world\u2019s poorest people of billions in lost revenue each year,\u201d said the Oxfam GB chief executive, Mark Goldring. \u201cThe new plans only require big companies to report on their activities in the EU and a yet-to-be-decided list of tax havens that is likely to be arbitrary and limited. Unless these proposals are extended to cover all countries there\u2019s a risk they could be close to pointless, as businesses will still be able to dodge taxes by diverting money to territories not included on the list.\u201d Toby Quantrill, a tax justice expert at Christian Aid, said: \u201cThe commission plans will allow multinationals to hide large parts of their global affairs from public scrutiny, which is a recipe for dodgy business as usual. \u201cUnless companies have to report on their activities in all the countries where they operate, they could continue to dodge tax on a massive scale, using the places still hidden from view.\u201d He added: \u201cThe Panama Papers are a graphic reminder of what happens when the powerful can hide: people and companies do things they would never have done in public.\u201d EU authorities have been striving to assert themselves on tax, ever since the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was exposed by the Luxembourg files during his first weeks in Brussels. The Luxleaks documents showed that tax authorities in Luxembourg had been rubber-stamping sweetheart deals on a grand scale at a time when Juncker led the country. Business groups, meanwhile, are unhappy with the commission\u2019s plans. Business Europe, the pan-European employers\u2019 association, said it was opposed to public country-by-country reporting. The director general, Markus Beyrer, said the group was ready to disclose such data to tax inspectors, but rejected wider scrutiny. \u201cThe idea to introduce public pressure on this issue is simply the wrong one,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will undermine the role of the tax authorities who should deal with this issue.\u201d Hill, appointed by David Cameron as the UK\u2019s European commissioner, rejected arguments that his proposals were anti-competitive and bad for business. \u201cPeople will need to be prepared to explain or justify the arrangements they have made and I think that is helpful,\u201d he said in an interview with the Guardian and two other European papers. \u201cYou are better off with a simpler system that people can understand. More complex systems lead to a greater amount of arbitrage. [Transparency] helps you identify where there might be questions and open up that debate.\u201d Since December 2015, most banks operating in the EU have been obliged to disclose profits and taxes, under separate rules. The first tranche of data analysed by Reuters, showed that five of the world\u2019s largest investment banks, including Bank of America and Deutsche Bank, paid no corporation tax in the UK in 2014.",

It\u2019s not right that smaller companies should be at a competitive disadvantage to multinationals.\u201d</p> <p>George Osborne, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/11/george-osborne-tax-return-reveals-198000-income\">who published his tax return on Monday</a> after mounting public pressure, welcomed the proposals as a step in the right direction.</p> <p> \u201cOur view is simple \u2013 the UK will have among the most competitive business taxes in the world, but these taxes must be paid,\u201d the chancellor said.</p> <p>The creation of an EU blacklist of tax havens could be a sensitive issue for the British government. Last year the Treasury criticised the commission\u2019s first attempt at drawing up a list of \u201cnon-co-operative tax jurisdictions\u201d as \u201cmisleading and deeply unhelpful\u201d. The list included several British overseas territories, including Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands.</p> <p>The legislation was first drawn up amid growing evidence that large corporations, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/24/amazons-uk-business-paid-119m-tax-last-year\">Amazon</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/07/vodafone-zero-corporation-tax-britain\">Vodafone</a>, were paying little tax despite earning healthy profits. Governments in the EU lose up to \u20ac70bn (\u00a356bn) a year through corporate tax avoidance, according to the European parliament.</p> <p>But as the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/eu-will-toughen-plans-to-make-firms-disclose-offshore-tax-bills\">reported on Friday</a>, the proposals were hastily rewritten to target fiscal havens, as a result of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/08/the-guardian-view-on-the-panama-papers-five-days-that-shook-the-world\">the leak from Panama of 11.5m files exposing the tax secrets of the global elite</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe Panama papers have not changed our agenda,\u201d Hill said, \u201cbut they have strengthened our determination to ensure that taxes are paid where profits are generated.\u201d</p> <p>Under the plans all multinationals with a turnover greater than \u20ac750m would be obliged to meet tougher standards on public disclosure. Around 6,500 companies would be affected, including around 4,000 subsidiaries of global corporations headquartered outside the EU.<br></p> <p>The proposals can still be amended as they go through the EU\u2019s lengthy legislative process; the final law will have to be agreed by a qualified majority of EU ministers and the European parliament. Under the fastest possible scenario, the rules will not come into force until 2018, meaning the first company reports would be published in 2019 after the end of the tax year.</p> <p>One obstacle is that the EU does not have an official list of tax havens, although commission officials have promised that one will be ready within six months. A list of 30 \u201cnon-co-operative tax jurisdictions\u201d, which included Panama and the British Virgin Islands, was published by the commission last year, but later withdrawn after it was derided by some member states. The British government does not have a list of tax havens and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/06/britain-under-pressure-opposition-tax-haven-blacklist\">criticised the list as unhelpful</a>.<br></p> <p>Officials in Brussels are counting on public outrage generated by the Panama Papers to help them reach a speedy agreement on both the proposals and the blacklist. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner in charge of tax policy, said: \u201cAfter the Panama Papers, there must not be a single hesitation from anybody that we need country-by-country reporting.\u201d<br></p> <p>Transparency campaigners said, however, that the proposals did not go far enough.</p> <p>A group of NGOs, including Oxfam and Action Aid, said the changes \u201cmake it impossible to effectively combat tax havens that have been at the centre of scandals\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe European commission\u2019s piecemeal proposals are not enough to end tax dodging that robs the world\u2019s poorest people of billions in lost revenue each year,\u201d said the Oxfam GB chief executive, Mark Goldring. </p> <p>\u201cThe new plans only require big companies to report on their activities in the EU and a yet-to-be-decided list of tax havens that is likely to be arbitrary and limited. Unless these proposals are extended to cover all countries there\u2019s a risk they could be close to pointless, as businesses will still be able to dodge taxes by diverting money to territories not included on the list.\u201d</p> <p>Toby Quantrill, a tax justice expert at Christian Aid, said: \u201cThe commission plans will allow multinationals to hide large parts of their global affairs from public scrutiny, which is a recipe for dodgy business as usual.</p> <p>\u201cUnless companies have to report on their activities in all the countries where they operate, they could continue to dodge tax on a massive scale, using the places still hidden from view.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cThe Panama Papers are a graphic reminder of what happens when the powerful can hide: people and companies do things they would never have done in public.\u201d</p> <p>EU authorities have been striving to assert themselves on tax, ever since the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was exposed by the Luxembourg files during his first weeks in Brussels. The Luxleaks documents showed that tax authorities in Luxembourg had been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/luxembourg-tax-files-juncker-weakened-scandal\">rubber-stamping sweetheart deals on a grand scale</a> at a time when Juncker led the country.<br></p> <p> </p> <p>Business groups, meanwhile, are unhappy with the commission\u2019s plans.</p> <p>Business Europe, the pan-European employers\u2019 association, said it was opposed to public country-by-country reporting. The director general, Markus Beyrer, said the group was ready to disclose such data to tax inspectors, but rejected wider scrutiny. \u201cThe idea to introduce public pressure on this issue is simply the wrong one,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will undermine the role of the tax authorities who should deal with this issue.\u201d</p> <p>Hill, appointed by David Cameron as the UK\u2019s European commissioner, rejected arguments that his proposals were anti-competitive and bad for business.</p> <p>\u201cPeople will need to be prepared to explain or justify the arrangements they have made and I think that is helpful,\u201d he said in an interview with the Guardian and two other European papers. \u201cYou are better off with a simpler system that people can understand. More complex systems lead to a greater amount of arbitrage. [Transparency] helps you identify where there might be questions and open up that debate.\u201d</p> <p>Since December 2015, most banks operating in the EU have been obliged to disclose profits and taxes, under separate rules. The first tranche of data <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-banks-tax-exclusive-idUKKBN0U51XH20151222\">analysed by Reuters</a>, showed that five of the world\u2019s largest investment banks, including Bank of America and Deutsche Bank, paid no corporation tax in the UK in 2014.<br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A British vote to leave the EU risks causing severe economic and political damage to Europe and will spill over into to weaken an already febrile world economy, according to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF listed a potential Brexit vote in June\u2019s EU referendum as a key risk in its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) triggering an immediate political reaction in the UK with Brexit campaigners accused the international institution of talking Britain down. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, said a decision to quit the EU was a \u201cvery real\u201d possibility and would affect economic growth even if an exit was managed smoothly. The body also cut its forecasts for global growth - and for the UK and other advanced economies. \u201cIn the United Kingdom, the planned June referendum on European Union membership has already created uncertainty for investors; a Brexit could do severe regional and global damage by disrupting established trading relationships,\u201d he said. David Cameron tweeted in support of the IMF\u2019s verdict: \u201cThe IMF is right - leaving the EU would pose major risks for the UK economy. We are strong, safer and better off in the European Union.\u201d George Osborne said it was as the \u201cclearest independent warning of the taste of bad things to come\u201d. The chancellor added: \u201cToday we have a stark warning from the IMF. For the first time they\u2019re saying that the threat of Britain leaving EU is having an impact on our economy and they cut our growth forecast as a result. \u201cThey say were we actually to leave the EU there would be a short-term impact on stability and a long-term cost to the economy.\u201d He argued that if the British economy is \u201chit by the mere risk of leaving the EU\u201d then the impact on people\u2019s incomes and jobs would be much worse if Brexit actually happened. The IMF said that after growing 2.2% in 2015, the UK economy is now expected to expand by only 1.9% in 2016, down from a forecast of 2.2% made by the Fund in January. That compares with 2.0% growth predicted for 2016 by the government\u2019s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility. A leading campaign group for Brexit accused Osborne of asking the IMF to step in and hurt the British economy. Vote Leave said there was no substantive evidence that the referendum had created uncertainty, pointing out that David Cameron had himself insisted the vote itself would not unsettle the economy. They also argued that IMF forecasts showed UK growth to be robust, and better than the rest of the Eurozone this year. \u201cThe IMF has talked down the British economy in the past and now it is doing it again at the request of our own chancellor. It was wrong then and it is wrong now. The irony is that if we Vote Remain our voice at the IMF will be silenced as the EU wants to take our seat at the top table in return for the \u00a3350m we hand to Brussels every week,\u201d said Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott. \u201cThe biggest risk to the UK\u2019s economy and security is remaining in an unreformed EU which is institutionally incapable of dealing with the challenges it faces, such as the euro and migration crises.\u201d The Washington-based Fund said economic growth was also threatened by a host of other factors, including \u201cthe tragedy of large-scale refugee inflows\u201d to Europe, a potential reappearance of financial market turmoil, China\u2019s difficult economic rebalancing and growing income inequality. It had already warned about the economic impact of uncertainty around June\u2019s referendum but this WEO goes further: \u201cNegotiations on post-exit arrangements would likely be protracted, resulting in an extended period of heightened uncertainty that could weigh heavily on confidence and investment, all the while increasing financial market volatility.\u201d The CBI, the business lobby group, said that without full access to the EU\u2019s single market the UK would struggle to maintain and build on the \u00a3377bn worth of investment from the Netherlands, Germany, France and Spain. Speaking ahead of a meeting of European business leaders and the prime minister at Downing street, Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, said: \u201cThere are many reasons why foreign firms choose to put their money into the UK - our time zone, talent and language - but there\u2019s no doubt, being in the EU with full access to the single market is a large part of the UK\u2019s appeal.\u201d With polls remaining tight in the high-stakes EU referendum, Cameron appears to be increasing the intensity of his campaigning, with a 16 page government leaflet costing \u00a39.3m arriving on doorsteps this week. On the other side, Vote Leave, highlighted the fact that IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, is facing criminal allegations over a payment to a French businessman. UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who is a spokesman for another group Grassroots Out, sought to undermine the warning by claiming it was an example of the establishment protecting its own interest. \u201cThe IMF has been hijacked by the architects of the failing EU project, so of course they want the UK to remain,\u201d he said. Sources in government said that these attacks were a sign that Brexit campaigners were worried about the impact of the international warning. The IMF used its half-yearly update on the health of the world economy to warn that the global recovery was too slow and increasingly fragile. The Fund was again forced to concede its earlier forecasts had been too optimistic. The IMF now predicts global GDP growth will edge up only slightly this year, to 3.2%, from growth of 3.1% in 2015. That compared with a 2016 forecast of 3.4% in a January update and of 3.6% in the last WEO in October. The 2017 forecast was cut to 3.5% from, 3.6% in January. \u201cGlobal growth continues, but at an increasingly disappointing pace that leaves the world economy more exposed to negative risks. Growth has been too slow for too long,\u201d Obstfeld told a press briefing to unveil the latest forecasts. Since October\u2019s outlook, investors have been spooked by another bout of turmoil on financial markets and the IMF raised the prospect of such wild swings in stock prices and other assets returning, with potential knock-on effects for the broader economy. The co-founder of another major Brexit campaign group, Grassroots Out, attacked the \u201cscaremongering of establishment organisations\u201d. The Conservative MP Peter Bone said the IMF had got a number of forecasts wrong in the past. \u201cThe IMF supported the failed euro \u2013 and now supports the UK remaining in the EU at the request of the British government,\u201d Bone said. \u201cThe real risk to the UK economy is remaining in a failing EU club that will tax our financial services, depress wages via mass migration and continue to impose burdensome red tape on our small and medium-sized businesses.\u201d Buoyed by consumer spending, Britain was expected to be the second fastest growing economy in the G7 industrial nations this year behind the US. The IMF predicts US GDP will expand 2.4% this year and 2.5% next year, lower than January\u2019s forecasts by 0.2 percentage points and 0.1 percentage point, respectively. None of the other G7 countries \u2013 Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada \u2013 is predicted to post growth as high as 2% in either 2016 or 2017. Japan\u2019s economy, which has struggled with labour shortages and deflation, is forecast to contract in 2017, by 0.1%. \u201cGrowth in advanced economies is projected to remain modest, in line with 2015 outcomes. Unfavourable demographic trends, low productivity growth, and legacies from the global financial crisis continue to hamper a more robust pickup in activity,\u201d a summary of the IMF report said. China was the only big economy for which the IMF raised its growth forecast for this year. Chinese GDP is now seen rising 6.5% in 2016, up from a previous forecast of 6.3% as strong consumer demand and growth in the services sector offset weakness in manufacturing. But the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second biggest, remains on a slowing path. GDP growth exceeded 10% in 2010, was 6.9% in 2015 and is forecast at 6.2% in 2017. The IMF used the report to repeat calls on governments not to rely on low interest rates alone to drive the recovery and instead to do their share of the heavy lifting by pursuing more growth friendly policies.

The Fund was again forced to concede its earlier forecasts had been too optimistic.<br></p> <p>The IMF now predicts global GDP growth will edge up only slightly this year, to 3.2%, from growth of 3.1% in 2015. That compared with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/imf-cuts-global-growth-forecasts\">2016 forecast of 3.4% in a January update</a> and of 3.6% in the last WEO in October.

The Conservative MP Peter Bone said the IMF had got a number of forecasts wrong in the past. \u201cThe IMF supported the failed euro \u2013 and now supports the UK remaining in the EU at the request of the British government,\u201d Bone said.</p> <p>\u201cThe real risk to the UK economy is remaining in a failing EU club that will tax our financial services, depress wages via mass migration and continue to impose burdensome red tape on our small and medium-sized businesses.\u201d</p> <p>Buoyed by consumer spending, Britain was expected to be the second fastest growing economy in the G7 industrial nations this year behind the US. The IMF predicts US GDP will expand 2.4% this year and 2.5% next year, lower than January\u2019s forecasts by 0.2 percentage points and 0.1 percentage point, respectively.</p> <p>None of the other G7 countries \u2013 Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada \u2013 is predicted to post growth as high as 2% in either 2016 or 2017. Japan\u2019s economy, which has struggled with labour shortages and deflation, is forecast to contract in 2017, by 0.1%.<br></p> <p>\u201cGrowth in advanced economies is projected to remain modest, in line with 2015 outcomes. Unfavourable demographic trends, low productivity growth, and legacies from the global financial crisis continue to hamper a more robust pickup in activity,\u201d a summary of the IMF report said.<br></p> <p>China was the only big economy for which the IMF raised its growth forecast for this year. Chinese GDP is now seen rising 6.5% in 2016, up from a previous forecast of 6.3% as strong consumer demand and growth in the services sector offset weakness in manufacturing.<br></p> <p>But the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second biggest, remains on a slowing path. GDP growth exceeded 10% in 2010, was 6.9% in 2015 and is forecast at 6.2% in 2017.<br></p> <p>The IMF used the report to repeat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/24/imf-urges-uk-to-ease-austerity-should-economy-slow-further\">calls on governments not to rely on low interest rates alone to drive the recovery</a> and instead to do their share of the heavy lifting by pursuing more growth friendly policies. It further called on world leaders to come up with joint contingency plans for a downturn.</p> <p>The Fund also raised the prospect of secular stagnation, or a permanent downward shift in the potential growth rates of advanced economies.</p> <p>\u201cPersistent slow growth has scarring effects that themselves reduce potential output and with it, consumption and investment.

Other ads will focus on a farm producing free range eggs and fishermen that supply Waitrose fresh fish counters. The upmarket chain says the campaign is in response to demand from its shoppers for quality food and wanting reassurance about provenance. Waitrose says all the farms featured are genuine.

      "bodyText": "Cast your mind back 10 years. It is April 2006 and finance ministers from around the world are gathering in Washington for the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund. Gordon Brown is Britain\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer. Alan Greenspan has just retired as the chairman of the Federal Reserve and is considered to be the greatest central banker who ever lived. The blossom is out and the mood is upbeat. The global economy is having its fastest burst of prolonged growth since the early 1970s. A lot has changed since. The venue is the same. The occasion is the same. But the atmosphere is completely different. Back in 2006, the IMF saw no reason why the boom could not go on for ever. Its flagship half-yearly World Economic Outlook expected activity to keep humming along. It saw no sub-prime crisis, no collapse of Lehman Brothers, no Great Recession. Unbridled optimism has now been replaced by deep pessimism. The IMF has started to buy into the theory \u2013 espoused by Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary, and others \u2013 that the world is sinking into secular stagnation. That\u2019s a state of affairs where demand is not robust enough prompting permanently low growth and deflation. A real, if unspoken fear, is of a return to the inward-looking and nationalistic policies that marked the 1930s. Maurice Obstfeld, the Fund\u2019s economic counsellor, said stagnant pay and rising inequality had created a sense that the rewards from economic growth were being creamed off by \u201cmobile elites and owners of capital\u201d, leaving too many others behind. Is the Fund being too gloomy? Some might think so and could rightly point to the organisation\u2019s less than stellar forecasting record. The IMF tends to go with the flow: it is late to spot both downturns and recoveries. That said, the Fund\u2019s analysis has the ring of truth about it. By historic standards, global growth of just over 3% this year would be extremely modest, especially given that interest rates have been so low for so long. Rising inequality has been a factor in this underwhelming performance: households are not enjoying strong growth in wages and are reluctant to load up on debt, as they did in the bubble years. Anger is manifesting itself in a number of ways. It has surfaced in the US presidential race. It is apparent in Europe where, as Obstfeld notes, \u201cthe political consensus that once propelled the European project is fraying\u201d. And it is the reason the UK will be holding a referendum on EU membership on 23 June. The prospect of Brexit clearly scares the IMF. A vote to leave would, it says, have serious consequences not just for Britain and its EU partners but for the whole of the global economy. The Fund is twitchy. It can identify a number of different triggers that might possibly bring about a new, dangerous phase of the crisis \u2013 such as a sharper than expected slowdown in China, a collapse in emerging markets or a pandemic. But with little more than two months to go before the referendum, Brexit is the most immediate threat. But if the Fund is right in its assessment, something will trigger the crisis sooner or later even if Britain decides to remain an EU member. The IMF says global growth has been too slow for too long, and proposes a mix of expansionary monetary policy (low interest rates and quantitative easing), higher spending on infrastructure and research and development, and structural reforms to boost productivity. This, though, seems a bit timid if the Fund is right in its analysis that globalisation benefits the few not the many and that a rising tide no longer lifts all boats. In that case, the remedy would not be more R&amp;D spending but checks on financial speculation and more aggressive redistribution. Global growth has indeed been too slow for too long. The Fund\u2019s remedy is too little too late.",

      "body": "<p>Cast your mind back 10 years. It is April 2006 and finance ministers from around the world are gathering in Washington for the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund. Gordon Brown is Britain\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer. <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Krugman-Greenspan-Fed-economy/2015/05/06/id/642982/\">Alan Greenspan has just retired as the chairman of the Federal Reserve and is considered to be the greatest central banker who ever lived</a>. The blossom is out and the mood is upbeat. The global economy is having its fastest burst of prolonged growth since the early 1970s.</p> <p>A lot has changed since. The venue is the same. The occasion is the same. But the atmosphere is completely different. Back in 2006, the IMF saw no reason why the boom could not go on for ever. <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/pdf/weo0406.pdf\">Its flagship half-yearly World Economic Outlook expected activity to keep humming along.</a> It saw no sub-prime crisis, no collapse of Lehman Brothers, no Great Recession.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/12/imf-says-britain-leaving-the-eu-is-a-significant-risk\">IMF says Britain leaving the EU is a significant risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unbridled optimism has now been replaced by deep pessimism. The IMF has started to buy into <a href=\"http://larrysummers.com/2016/02/17/the-age-of-secular-stagnation/\">the theory \u2013 espoused by Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary, and others \u2013 that the world is sinking into secular stagnation</a>. That\u2019s a state of affairs where demand is not robust enough prompting permanently low growth and deflation.</p> <p>A real, if unspoken fear, is of a return to the inward-looking and nationalistic policies that marked the 1930s. Maurice Obstfeld, the Fund\u2019s economic counsellor, said stagnant pay and rising inequality had created a sense that the rewards from economic growth were being creamed off by \u201cmobile elites and owners of capital\u201d, leaving too many others behind.</p> <p>Is the Fund being too gloomy? Some might think so and could rightly point to the organisation\u2019s less than stellar forecasting record. The IMF tends to go with the flow: it is late to spot both downturns and recoveries.</p> <p>That said, the Fund\u2019s analysis has the ring of truth about it. By historic standards, global growth of just over 3% this year would be extremely modest, especially given that interest rates have been so low for so long. Rising inequality has been a factor in this underwhelming performance: households are not enjoying strong growth in wages and are reluctant to load up on debt, as they did in the bubble years.</p> <p>Anger is manifesting itself in a number of ways. It has surfaced in the US presidential race. It is apparent in Europe where, as Obstfeld notes, \u201cthe political consensus that once propelled the European project is fraying\u201d. And it is the reason the UK will be holding a referendum on EU membership on 23 June.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/24/brexit-referendum-destabilise-uk-economic-recovery-imf-lagarde\">The prospect of Brexit clearly scares the IMF</a>. A vote to leave would, it says, have serious consequences not just for Britain and its EU partners but for the whole of the global economy. The Fund is twitchy. It can identify a number of different triggers that might possibly bring about a new, dangerous phase of the crisis \u2013 such as a sharper than expected slowdown in China, a collapse in emerging markets or a pandemic. But with little more than two months to go before the referendum, Brexit is the most immediate threat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/04/imf_output_projections/giv-27167rMrQTo4I2ndG/\" data-alt=\"economic output projections\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/04/imf_output_projections/giv-27167rMrQTo4I2ndG/\">economic output projections</a> </figure>  <p>But if the Fund is right in its assessment, something will trigger the crisis sooner or later even if Britain decides to remain an EU member. The IMF says global growth has been too slow for too long, and proposes a mix of expansionary monetary policy (low interest rates and quantitative easing), higher spending on infrastructure and research and development, and structural reforms to boost productivity.</p> <p>This, though, seems a bit timid if the Fund is right in its analysis that globalisation benefits the few not the many and that a rising tide no longer lifts all boats. In that case, the remedy would not be more R&amp;D spending but checks on financial speculation and more aggressive redistribution. Global growth has indeed been too slow for too long. The Fund\u2019s remedy is too little too late.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has agreed to sell half its stake in Lazada, a south-east Asian online retailer, to China\u2019s Alibaba for about \u00a390m as the UK supermarket group concentrates on its home business. Tesco said it would sell 8.6% of Lazada to Alibaba, the world\u2019s largest retailer, for $129m (\u00a390.6m) in a deal valuing the business at $1.5bn. Alibaba will invest $500m in new Lazada shares as well as buying out Tesco and other investors in the Singapore-based retailer. Tesco will retain an 8.3% stake in Lazada after the transaction completes, including the issue of new shares, but Alibaba will have an option to buy out remaining investors within 12 to 18 months. The deal values Tesco\u2019s Lazada stake at significantly more than the \u00a3113m carrying value listed in its accounts last August. Tesco, which reports its annual results on Wednesday, classified Lazada as an asset available for sale for the financial year that ended in February. The former Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke bought 19.6% of Lazada in November 2013 as the grocer sought to improve its online capabilities in Asia. It has invested $124m in the business. Under new management after a series of profit warnings, Tesco has retrenched to overhaul its UK stores and has been selling international operations such as its business in South Korea. Alibaba, which sells almost 1bn consumer products, has overtaken Tesco and Walmart of the US to become the world\u2019s biggest retailer. It is expanding beyond China, where it makes about 90% of revenue, and wants to tap into fast-growing south-east Asian consumer markets such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Michael Evans, Alibaba\u2019s president, said: \u201cGlobalisation is a critical strategy for the growth of Alibaba today and well into the future. With the investment in Lazada, Alibaba gains access to a platform with a large and growing consumer base outside China, a proven management team and a solid foundation for future growth in one of the most promising regions for ecommerce globally.\u201d The deal will take Alibaba into a region where no single operator yet dominates. While south-east Asia\u2019s growing affluence is expected to fuel growth in online shopping, many countries in the region lack transport and payments systems required for online retailing to take off.

      "bodyText": "Asos plans to boost investment in its remaining overseas businesses after closing its China operations, the online fashion retailer said as it reported an 18% rise in half year profits. The company will incur closure costs of \u00a310m in China, but the \u00a32m it previously planned to spend in the country will be redeployed in other markets. Apart from the UK, Asos sees its main markets as France, Germany and the US. In the US it will receive a \u00a36m to \u00a38m boost in the second half from changes in import duty thresholds in March, and this will be invested in its American business. First half profits rose 18% to a slightly better than expected \u00a321.1m, despite increasing competition from the likes of Boohoo and improved online offerings from established store groups. UK sales rose by 25% and international revenues were up 18%, with investment in its technology and logistics helping to boost business. Chief executive Nick Beighton said: We are on track to achieve our previously stated sales and margin guidance for the full year. The news has pushed the company\u2019s shares more than 6% higher to \u00a336.22. Analysts at HSBC said: An increased focus on mobile is the key driver of top-line growth with mobile now accounting for over 60% of all Asos web traffic. Active customers were up 17% to 10.9m.

Costa\u2019s parent company, Whitbread, was one of the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest fallers after it announced that Christopher Rogers had decided to leave the group. Its shares fell 2.5% to \u00a337.42. Rogers will be replaced as Costa\u2019s managing director by Dominic Paul, a senior vice president at the cruise company Royal Caribbean International. Paul will start his new role on 6 June. Rogers has led Costa \u2013 now one of the most visible brands on Britain\u2019s high streets \u2013 since July 2012. Under his leadership, the number of Costa coffee shops has risen to more than 3,200 from fewer than 2,500. Rogers has been at Whitbread for 11 years. Before taking over at Costa, he was the group\u2019s finance director. He missed out on the group chief executive role when Alison Brittain took over at Whitbread in December 2015. Commenting on his departure, Rogers said: \u201cI have loved being part of Whitbread and Costa during what has been a period of enormous value creation and growth, and after 11 years, I have decided that now is the right time for change.\u201d Last month Whitbread blamed mild winter weather and lower footfall on the UK\u2019s high streets for slower sales growth at Costa. Like-for-like sales \u2013 which excludes sales from stores open for less than a year \u2013 grew by 0.5% in the 11 weeks to 11 February, down from 2.5% in the previous quarter. Mark Brumby, analyst at Langton Capital, said the change in leadership could fuel rumours that Whitbread will spin-off Costa as a standalone business. \u201cWhether this is more or less likely, however, is unclear,\u201d he added. Rogers will step down from the Whitbread board following the next meeting on 20 April. He will stay with the company until 1 July to allow a smooth handover to Paul, Whitbread said in a statement.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tax avoidance by multinational corporations will be forced into the open under proposals to be unveiled by European regulators on Tuesday following the Panama Papers revelations. The European commission will put forward legislation requiring large multinationals operating in Europe to disclose profits earned and taxes paid in each of the EU\u2019s 28 member states, as well as fiscal havens. All large companies trading in Europe, including subsidiaries of non-European businesses, would have to publish how much tax they pay outside the EU, including detailed country-by-country information on their finances in tax havens. The commission was already working on measures to force international companies to disclose their earnings and tax bills in the EU. Following the leak of 11.5m files exposing the tax secrets of the global elite, officials have toughened up their plans to include tax havens. Lord Hill, the European commissioner in charge of financial services, confirmed on Monday that the proposals were being extended to tax havens, in response to the public outcry over the revelations in the Panama papers. The massive data leak had \u201cshifted the public mood\u201d and it was sensible to reflect that in the proposals, he told the Guardian and two other European newspapers in an interview. Finding the right balance on draft legislation \u201cis to do with what is the political and public mood, how much appetite is there for people to be prepared to make changes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe revelations have shifted that bit of the balance.\u201d The original proposals were drawn up after public outcry over large corporations, such as Apple and Starbucks, paying little tax despite earning healthy profits. The EU loses up to \u20ac70bn (\u00a356bn) a year through corporate tax avoidance, according to the European parliament. Under the plans all multinational companies with a turnover greater than \u20ac750m would be obliged to meet tougher standards on public disclosure. Hill, who was appointed by David Cameron as the UK\u2019s EU commissioner, said that his proposals would help rebuild trust in business. \u201cThere is a sort of anti-business mood afoot, which I don\u2019t think is healthy because you need to have a strong business sector, which is creating jobs and playing for public services. If you get something like this right it should help in that process.\u201d He said it was hard to justify to small- and medium-sized companies \u201cwhy they should be paying at a higher effective tax rate\u201d. The proposals, which are expected to be published at 2pm BST, still have to be agreed by a qualified majority of EU finance ministers and the European parliament before they can enter into force. One pitfall is that the EU does not have an official list of tax havens, although commission officials have promised that one will be ready within six months. A list of 30 \u201cnon-co-operative tax jurisdictions\u201d that included Panama and the British Virgin Islands was published by the commission last year, but later withdrawn after it was rubbished by some member states. The British government does not have a list of tax havens and had criticised the list as unhelpful. Officials in Brussels are counting on public outrage generated by the Panama papers to help reach a speedy agreement on the proposals, as well as an EU blacklist of tax havens. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner in charge of tax policy, has insisted that no government can now waver on these measures. \u201cAfter the Panama Papers, there must not be a single hesitation from anybody, that we need country-by-country reporting,\u201d he said. Ahead of the release of the proposals, transparency campaigners warned they may not go far enough. \u201cAs long as the proposal doesn\u2019t cover all countries, multinational corporations will still have plenty of opportunities to hide their profits, said Tove Maria Ryding, tax justice coordinator at the European Network on Debt and Development. \u201cSo instead of solving the problem, this proposal would be moving the problem from one country to another, with multinationals still able to avoid taxes.\u201d Business groups are also unhappy with plans to compel companies to disclose their profits to the public and not just the tax authorities. Business Europe, the pan-European employers\u2019 association, \u201cis heavily opposed to [public] country by country reporting\u201d, its director general, Markus Beyrer, has said. The group is ready to disclose country-by-country data to tax inspectors, but rejects wider scrutiny. \u201cThe idea to introduce public pressure on this issue is simply the wrong one,\u201d Beyrer said. \u201cThis will undermine the role of the tax authorities who should deal with this issue.\u201d Hill rejected the arguments that his proposals were anti-competitive and bad for business. \u201cPeople will need to be prepared to explain or justify the arrangements they have made and I think that is helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are better off with a simpler system that people can understand. More complex systems lead to a greater amount of arbitrage. [Transparency] helps you identify where there might be questions and open up that debate.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inflation jumped to 0.5% in the year to March after a rise in the cost of air fares over Easter and more expensive spring and summer clothing ranges hitting stores. The higher cost of booking a hotel and restaurant table also pushed inflation beyond the 0.3% seen in February, according to official figures. The increase surprised most City analysts who expected inflation, which was negative in only October last year, to stay near zero or inch up to 0.4%. Some dismissed the significance of the rise, saying it was largely the result of an earlier Easter distorting the year-on-year comparison. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cMarch\u2019s rise in inflation was significantly due to the earlier Easter in 2016 compared to 2015. This caused air fares to rise 22.9% month-on-month this March compared to an increase of 2.7% in March 2015.\u201d Archer emphasised that British consumers were continuing to enjoy one of the longest periods of low inflation in a generation; this was likely to come to an end over the coming months as higher petrol prices, rising average wages and higher import prices from the low pound fed into the figures. \u201cWhile consumer price inflation may dip in April, it is expected to trend gradually upwards to reach 1.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2.0% in the latter months of 2017. Other analysts said the Easter air fare rise was more significant and would herald larger rises in inflation this year. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cAirfares were reportedly boosted by Easter in late March, but we have our doubts that all of their rise is temporary. \u2018Index Day\u2019, when the data are collected, is always either the second or third Tuesday of the month; the ONS does not say which immediately. It was either on March 8 or March 15 this year, at least nearly two full weeks before Easter.\u201d A collapse in the cost of food and petrol over the last year have been the main factors bringing down inflation and these are likely to stabilise or increase this year, he said, pushing up the average cost of goods and services in the inflation basket.",

The sports retailer has agreed to buy the freehold of Academy House on the corner of Oxford Street and Soho\u2019s Poland Street. It will open a flagship 20,000 sq ft Flannels store and use the floors above for its new London office. The deal was overseen by Michael Murray, the boyfriend of Ashley\u2019s eldest daughter, Anna. Murray was put in charge of the retailer\u2019s property empire last year and could potentially earn millions of pounds in bonuses. Murray\u2019s appointment raised questions about Ashley\u2019s dominance of the company because Murray had little experience of the commercial property world. Murray can earn up to 25% of the value his deals create \u2013 though Sports Direct has declined to clarify how the value is measured. The company sold its former London office in New Cavendish Street for \u00a344m to the University of Westminster last year before Murray\u2019s appointment. It has been looking for a high-profile London site since. A Sports Direct spokesman said Academy House met all Sports Direct\u2019s strategic requirements and the purchase repaid the faith the company had placed in Murray, who lives with Ashley\u2019s daughter, in a London house he bought for \u00a310.75m with a loan from Ashley. Academy House is on the tattier eastern side of Oxford Street with more prestigious Selfridges, John Lewis and Bond Street to the west. But the area to the east of Oxford Circus is being redeveloped along with the \u00a31bn rebuilding of Tottenham Court Road station for London\u2019s giant Crossrail transport project. Sports Direct bought a 51% stake in Flannels in 2012 to add to its non-sports \u201cpremium lifestyle\u201d division, which also includes the USC and Cruise chains. The company is expanding Flannels as trading at its core Sports Direct stores suffers. The chain, which sells brands such as Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Moschino, was founded by Neil Prosser in Knutsford, Cheshire, in 1976 and claims to have introduced major designers to the north west. Prosser retained a 49% stake in the business, which was loss-making at the time Sports Direct took control. Flannels\u2019 most recent accounts, for the year to April 2015, showed the business swinging to a \u00a31.7m pre-tax profit from a \u00a31.6m loss helped by increased revenue and cost savings from moving admin functions to Sports Direct\u2019s head office.",
