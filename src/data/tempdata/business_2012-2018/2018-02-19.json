      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s biggest electronics retailers is racing to find a buyer in an effort to save the business from administration. Maplin, which was founded in 1972 and has more than 200 stores nationwide, is in talks with several potential buyers and hopes to strike a deal this week. It is the latest high-street chain to face problems and comes weeks after a plan to save Toys R Us UK fell through, putting more than 3,000 jobs at risk. The electronics chain, which has been backed by the private equity house Rutland Partners since 2014, could be bought by Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which also owns Jaeger, Peacocks and Jane Norman, according to reports. A Maplin spokesman said: \u201cWe are in advanced talks with a number of parties and expect to be in a position to announce a solvent sale of the business within days. \u201cOnce secured, this will stabilise the business to the benefit of all stakeholders and provide Maplin with the financial firepower to deliver its 2020 multichannel strategy focused on smart tech.\u201d Maplin is said to be optimistic that the sale will be solvent rather than a pre-pack, which would be good news for the 2,500 people it employs. However a pre-pack sale \u2013 which allows the healthy part of a business that has gone into administration to be sold on quickly \u2013 will be considered if a deal for a solvent sale cannot be reached. According to accounts filed at Companies House in January, Maplin recorded a pre-tax loss of \u00a33.9m in 2016-17, which was up from \u00a32.1m in the year before. However, turnover rose to \u00a3235.8m from \u00a3234.6m the previous year. A statement to go alongside the accounts described 2016-17 as a \u201ctransformational and challenging year\u201d for the business and said progress had been made on the group\u2019s 2020 Vision strategy. The retailer hit rocky ground before Christmas when insurers withdrew credit cover having been spooked by falling profits. This resulted in stock shortages which contributed to disappointing sales in the crucial Christmas period. Oliver Meakin, who recently announced he was stepping down as chief executive of Maplin, told Retail Week in January that Brexit had had an impact on the business. He said: \u201cPretty much everything we buy is dollar denominated, so our costs have gone up by 15% ... When your costs go up by that margin, you cannot shoulder that as a retailer.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The fast food chain KFC has been forced to temporarily close most of its UK outlets after problems with a new delivery contract led to a chicken shortage. A total of 562 KFC outlets remained shut following a weekend of disruption that peaked on Sunday night at 646 closures. KFC published a list of only 338 of its 900 stores that were still open on Monday night. Many were offering a limited menu and restricted opening hours. The chicken delivery problem is so severe that the company cannot say when operations will be back to normal. But it said it was working \u201cflat out\u201d to resolve the crisis. Signs on many of the closed stores said: \u201cSorry, we\u2019re closed. We deliver our chickens fresh into our restaurants, but we\u2019ve had a few hiccups with the delivery today. We wouldn\u2019t want to be open without offering our full menu, but we\u2019ll be back at the fryers as soon as we can.\u201d KFC tried to make light of the problem, saying \u201cthe colonel is working on it\u201d - a reference to the chain\u2019s US founder, Colonel Sanders, whose image adorns the brand. In a statement it blamed the chicken shortage on a contract with delivery company DHL. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought a new delivery partner on board, but they\u2019ve had a couple of teething problems \u2013 getting fresh chicken out to 900 restaurants across the country is pretty complex,\u201d it said, adding: \u201cWe won\u2019t compromise on quality, so no deliveries has meant some of our restaurants are closed and others are operating a limited menu, or shortened hours.\u201d The US-owned company also apologised to customers who found UK stores closed since the end of last week. \u201cWe know that this might have inconvenienced some of you over the last few days, and disappointed you when you wanted your fried chicken fix \u2013 we\u2019re really sorry about that,\u201d the statement said. The problems came after KFC switched its deliveries from Bidvest Logistics to DHL in a deal struck last year. DHL said \u201coperational issues\u201d meant several KFC deliveries over recent days had been incomplete or delayed. It added: \u201cWe are working with KFC and our partners to rectify the situation as a priority and apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.\u201d DHL announced in November that it had been appointed alongside QSL to manage the supply and distribution of food products and packaging for more than 850 KFC outlets in the UK. DHL said it would manage the physical warehouse and distribution service. KFC added it had specifically chosen the pair for their reputation of \u201cinnovation in logistics\u201d across other industries. The KFC closures have led to complaints and ridicule from customers. YouTube user The BigPac recorded a video of his frustration after finding \u201cthree or four\u201d KFC closed in the Manchester. He said: \u201cI cannot believe KFC ... we\u2019re going to hit a MacDonald\u2019s up. That is shit mate. We like our chicken.\u201d He added: \u201cI am proper wounded that no KFC is open. Not one.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green has poured cold water on a report that he is in talks to sell his Arcadia retail empire, which includes Topshop and Miss Selfridge, to the Chinese firm Shandong Ruyi. Green issued the denial as the work and pensions select committee chair, Frank Field, wrote to him demanding assurances that Arcadia\u2019s pension schemes would not be \u201cdetached\u201d from the tycoon\u2019s family interests in the event of a sale. In a statement, Green and the Arcadia board said reports in a Sunday newspaper that they were plotting a sale to Shandong Ruyi were \u201ctotally false\u201d. \u201cNeither Sir Philip nor any of the directors of Arcadia have ever met or had any contact with Shandong Ruyi, and they have never been to the Arcadia offices as was suggested to look at the company\u2019s books,\u201d the statement said. Arcadia also denied that discussions about a deal had taken place with HSBC, adding that there was \u201cno truth\u201d in the suggestion that Green has been \u201cseeking a buyer for some time\u201d. \u201cThe 22,000 people that work at Arcadia should not be subjected to this type of malicious rumour-mongering,\u201d the company said. The denial came shortly after Field published a letter in which he called on Green to clarify the future of Arcadia\u2019s pension scheme, which has a \u00a3565m deficit, in the event of a sale. Field said pensioners should not be \u201chung out to dry\u201d, reminding Green of the fallout that followed his sale of the BHS chain for \u00a31 to the serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell. The subsequent collapse of BHS triggered a long-running saga that ended with Green paying \u00a3363m into a scheme with a deficit of \u00a3571m, after a settlement with the Pensions Regulator under which he avoided enforcement action. Field advised Green that he should seek approval from the regulator before seeking to sell Arcadia in order to \u201cspare you another moral hazard investigation\u201d. In its statement, Arcadia said it was not in any sale talks that could affect the scheme and also pointed to a commitment the company made last year to double pension contributions to \u00a350m in an effort to close its deficit within a decade.",

      "bodyText": "After a fairly uneventful morning, European markets took another turn lower as investors turned cautious once more. With no guidance from Wall Street, closed for the President\u2019s Day holiday, shares went into reverse as the day progressed. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It was hard to ascertain exactly what caused Monday\u2019s late reversal. For the FTSE a copper-led decline in its mining stocks \u2013 which have a busy week of reporting ahead of them \u2013 certainly contributed, as did Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s post-full year results 5.5% decline. The lack of news from the US likely didn\u2019t help, with investors seemingly craving reassurances that the Dow Jones is willing to continue last week\u2019s recovery before following suit. Regardless, the fact that the markets have turned negative on a day almost completely devoid of anything interesting news-wise perhaps gives an indication where sentiment currently lies. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The worry is that the US will follow this pattern when it reopens tomorrow, which would accord with the historical norm; another test of the lows, and a possible new low, before the \u2018ball held underwater\u2019 springs higher once again, catching everyone off guard. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 47.04 points or 0.64% at 7247.66 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.53% to 12,385.6 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.48% at 5256.18 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1% to 22,568.92 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.26% at 9806.2 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.38% to 846.07 On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. With Spain\u2019s Luis de Guindos set to become vice president of the European Central Bank, there is a suggestion this could clear the way for Germany\u2019s Jens Weidmann to take over as the head of the ECB. Reuters reports: Euro zone finance ministers on Monday chose Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos to succeed European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio in May, a move likely to boost the chances of a German becoming head of the ECB next year. The choice of a Southern European for vice president increases the likelihood that a northerner such as German Bundesbank governor Jens Weidmann could be elected to replace Mario Draghi as head of the ECB in 2019. This could influence the bank\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy. \u201cThe Eurogroup (of euro zone finance ministers) today gave its support to the candidacy of Luis de Guindos for the position of Vice President of the European Central Bank (ECB),\u201d an EU statement said after a brief discussion among finance ministers. De Guindos said he would resign as Economy Minister within days after being chosen as ECB Vice-President. Initially faced with two candidates -- de Guindos and Irish central bank governor Philip Lane -- the ministers had their choice made simple for them by Ireland\u2019s decision to withdraw Lane\u2019s name. Spain\u2019s Luis de Guindos is set to become vice president of the European Central Bank after the eurogroup backed his appointment. The move looked a done deal when potential rival Philip Lane, the Irish central bank governor, withdrew from the race in the interests of \u201cconsensus.\u201d Here is the eurogroup statement on de Guindos: The Eurogroup today gave its support to the candidacy of Luis de Guindos for the position of Vice President of the European Central Bank (ECB). The recommendation to the European Council, composed of the heads of state and government, should be formally adopted by the Council on 20 February. On this basis, the European Council will request opinions from both the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the ECB. It is then expected to adopt its final decision at its meeting of 22-23 March. The new Vice President will replace V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio as of 1 June 2018. He will serve a non-renewable 8-year term. Back in the UK, and a troubled meat supplier has gone into administration: More than 260 workers have lost their jobs at the meat supplier Russell Hume, which has collapsed into administration just weeks after production was suspended following a food standards scare. Administrators announced 266 redundancies on Monday from the 302 employees at the company, which has its headquarters in Derby and operates from six production sites in Liverpool, Birmingham, London, Boroughbridge in North Yorkshire, Exeter and Fife. It is expected that all the company\u2019s employees will eventually lose their jobs. Meat products were prevented from leaving the group\u2019s factories last month after Food Standards Agency (FSA) inspectors found \u201cserious non-compliance with food hygiene regulations\u201d during a surprise visit to the Birmingham premises. Jamie Oliver\u2019s Italian restaurant chain and Wetherspoon were among the major restaurants and pub groups that were customers of Russell Hume. . The company\u2019s demise comes after the pork company Fairfax Meadow voluntarily recalled meat products earlier this month after an unannounced inspection revealed issues with use-by date labelling. Meanwhile, in September, a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation into 2 Sisters Food Group resulted in the country\u2019s largest supplier of supermarket chicken suspending production at its West Bromwich plant for five weeks. The full story is here: More from the eurogroup: Eurozone officials appear to be dashing Greek hopes that fresh loans of up to \u20ac5.7bn will be disbursed at today\u2019s eurogroup meeting, writes Helena Smith in Athens: Before heading to Brussels for today\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers, Greek officials had expressed hopes that new loans amounting to \u20ac5.7bn would be greenlit for release. The country\u2019s latest market foray and credit upgrade had strengthened hopes with the finance ministry announcing at the weekend that both provided \u201cstrong proof of restoration of investor confidence\u201d in the country. But officials, citing the latest compliance report of Athens\u2019 reform progress, are leaking that at least two prominent \u201cprior actions,\u201d or reforms, have to be completed before more loans are drawn down from its final \u20ac86bn bailout programme. The measures singled out are electronic auctions of foreclosed property \u2013 set to begin May 1st \u2013 and privatisation of Athens\u2019 old international airport, a mega project currently held up by a court decision. Auditors, who begin returning to Athens tomorrow, are hoping that both will be resolved by February 26th. Oil prices have moved higher, boosted by growing signs of a strengthening global economy and amid tensions in the Middle East, in particular between Israel and Iran. But there were some negative factors for crude, with US producers increasing output even as Opec continues its measures to try and limit supply. Brent crude has risen 0.68% to $65.28 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is up 0.9% at $62.24. Britain\u2019s millennials are losing out dramatically in financial terms compared to previous generations, according to a new report: Britain\u2019s millennial generation, born since 1981, have suffered a bigger reversal in financial fortunes than their counterparts in most other developed countries except Greece, according to a study. The report by the Resolution Foundation paints a gloomy picture for all young adults across the developed world \u2013 apart from the Nordic countries. It highlights how incomes are depressed, jobs scarce and home ownership is slumping for the millennial generation compared with the baby boomers that preceded them. But it also reveals that on many measures \u2013 apart from unemployment \u2013 British millennials have suffered a more significant decline than those in other countries. The full story is here: UK household finances deteriorated at fastest pace for seven months, according to the latest survey by IHS Markit, and around 60% expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates within the next six months: The pound has edged lower against the dollar and there could be further declines ahead, says Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com: The GBP/USD has rallied to its pre-Brexit levels of above 1.40 in recent weeks as the dollar sold off. However, with the recent improvement in US macro pointers, there is a good chance that the greenback could bottom out soon. If this is the case, then the cable could head lower. Brexit uncertainty is likely to offset the support the pound is receiving from a hawkish Bank of England amid improving UK data and rising inflation. The potentially weaker exchange rate will be a welcome relief for export names in particular. However, if the relentless dollar selling continues then the cable could extend its gains further and this may be an additional factor weighing on the FTSE. In the more near-term outlook, the latest UK wages data on Wednesday and the second estimate for UK GDP a day later on Thursday should cause the pound \u2013 and therefore the FTSE \u2013 to move sharply. Sterling is currently down 0.24% at $1.4005. With US markets shut for President\u2019s Day and no major economic news, there is little impetus for European shares to show much movement, and so it has proved up until now. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Given all the drama February has brought with it, you can forgive investors for choosing to take a bit of a breather this President\u2019s Day. Without the US markets to provide any guidance this afternoon the European indices decided it was better to do nothing this Monday. The FTSE slipped by 0.1%, leaving it just below 7290; the DAX, meanwhile, gave up its 12500-crossing growth to sit flat around the 12460 mark, with the CAC trickling a couple of points lower. The forex markets were just as barren. Cable was broadly unchanged at $1.4025, recovering from some morning losses that briefly left it the wrong side of $1.40, while against the euro the pound nudged 0.1% higher to tease \u20ac1.13. In terms of earnings, Reckitt Benckiser kicked off a very busy week in pretty inauspicious fashion, contributing to the FTSE\u2019s sluggish start. Despite a Mead Johnson-boosted 21% rise in total revenue to \u00a311.5 billion and an 11% surge in pre-tax profit to \u00a32.5 billion, the consumer goods firm \u2013 which counts Nurofen and Durex among its stable of products \u2013 fell 5.5% as the day went on, with investors disappointed that full year like-for-like growth was flat. Newsflash: Another 152 workers at Carillion have been made redundant, following its collapse into liquidation last month. The Official Receiver, which took control of the outsourcing group, says this takes the total number of jobs lost to 1,141. In happier news, 942 jobs have been saved -- because Carillion contracts have been taken on by other suppliers. That takes the total number of jobs protected to 7,641. More than 10,000 Carillion workers still face uncertainty, though, as the company employed almost 20,000 in the UK. The Official Receiver says: \u201cDiscussions with potential purchasers continue and I expect that the number of jobs safeguarded through the liquidation will continue to rise. I am continuing to engage with staff, elected employee representatives and unions to keep them informed as these arrangements are confirmed.\u201d The news comes as MPs release evidence from several Carillion shareholders, which show that one - Edinburgh\u2019s Kiltearn - had considered suing the company. More here: The torpor in the City has been (briefly) broken by the news that European building firms boosted their output at the end of last year. Construction output across the EU rose by 0.6% month-on-month in December. Within the eurozone, it rose by a more modest 0.1%. The figures also show that, during 2017, construction output rose by a healthy 3.5% across the EU - and by 2.4% in the euro area. Another sign that Europe\u2019s economy strengthened last year. Greece\u2019s bailout is back on the agenda today. Eurozone finance ministers will discuss Athens\u2019 progress when they gather for a Eurogroup meeting in Brussels this afternoon. Greece\u2019s minister Euclid Tsakalotos will brief the room about the implementation of various \u2018prior actions\u2019 under its bailout review programme. Once they are all completed, the next tranche of the Greek bailout will be handed over. Greece got a boost on Friday night, when rating agency Fitch raised its credit rating from B- to B, with a positive outlook, saying: Fitch believes that general government debt sustainability will improve, underpinned by sustained GDP growth, reduced political risks, a record of general government primary surpluses and additional fiscal measures legislated to take effect through 2020. Greece\u2019s current bailout is due to end this summer. Athens hopes to then return to the financial markets. Today, it\u2019s 10-year bonds are trading at a yield of around 4.2%. That\u2019s much lower than the \u2018danger zone\u2019 of around 7%, but higher than other euro countries. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, sees a \u201cpositive\u201d sentiment in the stock markets today as the global rebound continues. Many investors who are selling government bonds are putting the money into shares instead, she explains: Not even the unexpected indictments from Special Counsel Robert Mueller could hold the rally back, as US markets closed higher for the sixth straight session on Friday, resulting in the best week for US equities in five years. The strength of the equity recovery has surprised some, but the weight of money coming out of bond markets is primarily finding its way into equities, which, for the moment at least, look far more attractive than other alternatives. Latvia has been rocked by the news that its top central banker has been arrested Ilmars Rimsevics was detained by his country\u2019s anti-graft bureau on Sunday, as part of an anti-corruption clampdown. The news is also a blow to the European Central Bank as Rimsevics serves on its governing council. Bloomberg has more details: The detention followed a search by authorities of Rimsevics\u2019s office and private property, state-owned LTV reported. His lawyer, Saulvedis Varpins, said the governor considered the move against him as \u201cclearly illegal. Rimsevics has served as the governor of the Bank of Latvia since 2001 Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola has urged Rimsevics to step down, telling reporters: \u201cEach day that Mr. Rimsevics remains in the central bank\u2019s leadership significantly worsens. \u201cI think that at this moment, it would be wise if Mr. Rimsevics would at least, during the course of the investigation, step down.\u201d In another development, the ECB has halted all payments by one of Latvia\u2019s largest lenders, ABLV, this morning. US authorities accuse ABLV of money laundering and breaching sanctions against North Korea. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is being dragged back by consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser. Reckitt slightly missed City forecasts this morning; it reported like-for-like sales growth of 2% in the last quarter, vs estimates of 2.1%. Only a small miss, but enough to wipe 3% off the Nurofen-to-Cillit Bang maker\u2019s share price this morning. The FTSE 100 itself is up just 4 points, or 0.06%. Europe\u2019s major stock markets have opened higher, with Germany\u2019s DAX up 0.35% and the French CAC gaining 0.27%. Traders have taken their cue from the gains in Asia overnight. They also seem to be unruffled by the latest political tensions in America over Russian meddling in the presidential election. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, explains: Investor sentiment has gradually improved after fears of rising inflation sent most global indices into correction territory. The Cboe\u2019s Volatility Index (VIX) ended Friday\u2019s session below 20, suggesting that indictments from Special Counsel Robert Mueller against 13 Russian nationals for alleged interference in the 2016 elections did little to impact investor decisions. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are starting the new week in confident mood, as investors put the recent bout of volatility behind them. Shares are rallying across Asia today, and we\u2019re expecting a positive start to trading in Europe too. The markets seem to have got over their worries over American interest rate hikes, and the threat of rising inflation. Traders have concluded that shares look attractive again, following the sharp losses earlier this month. David Madden of CMC Markets says confidence is back in the markets: Stock markets around the world rebounded last week as investors took at advantage of the relatively low prices of equities. Whenever there is a severe sell-off in the stock markets, traders spend a lot of time wondering is there another leg lower coming, or is it safe to get back in the water. The move higher last week saw some indices reach their highest levels in over a week. Market confidence often attracts even more market confidence, and that is what we are seeing at the moment. The cooling of the volatility index (VIX) has been given some dealers the green light to buy back into the stock market, and while the fear factor keeps sliding, it is likely equity benchmarks will continue to push higher. So, Japan\u2019s Nikkei is up 2%, Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 has gained 0.6%, and the South Korean market is up 0.7%. (other markets are closed for the Lunar New Year). We\u2019ll also be watching the restaurant industry, as a report warns that the number of insolvencies jumped by 20% last year. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver hasn\u2019t been immune to these problems, and there are fears that his Barbecoa chain of steak restaurants could be in trouble if a buyer can\u2019t be found. Otherwise, it\u2019s looking like a quiet day - especially as it\u2019s President\u2019s Day in America. The agenda 10am GMT: Eurozone construction output data for December 2pm GMT: Eurozone finance ministers hold a eurogroup meeting in Brussels 5.45pm GMT: Bank of England governor Mark Carney gives a speech on Leadership and Values.",

Ilmars Rimsevics, who represents Latvia on the ECB general council, was questioned on a charge of demanding a bribe from the country\u2019s third largest bank, ABLV, which is being investigated in a separate money-laundering inquiry. Jekabs Straume, the head of Latvia\u2019s anti-corruption authority, denied the two cases were linked, and said Rimsevic\u2019s arrest was about \u201cdemanding a bribe of no less than \u20ac100,000\u201d. The case against the ABLV stems from claims by the US authorities that the bank has became a haven for money launderers and funnelled funds to North Korea in breach of international sanctions. Rimsevics was held overnight on Saturday while officials raided his offices and home. According to local TV reports, he emerged from questioning on Sunday to deny the allegations, which his lawyer said were only put to him verbally. Dana Reizniece-Ozola, Latvia\u2019s finance minister, said Rimsevics \u201cshould resign from his post at least for the time of the investigation\u201d. M\u0101ris Ku\u010dinskis, the prime minister, said: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that a governor of the Bank of Latvia detained over such a serious accusation could work.\u201d Raimonds V\u0113jonis, the country\u2019s president, called for a meeting of the national security council to discuss the situation. Latvia joined the euro in 2014 and Rimsevics, who has presided as governor of the country\u2019s central bank since 2001, has sat on the ECB council ever since. The ECB, which said Rimsevics\u2019 detention was a matter for Latvian authorities, has a duty to monitor the financial activities of eurozone member states and individual central banks. ABLV was forced to seek emergency financial support on Monday as it came under wider scrutiny for allegedly being a conduit for illicit financial activities. It was ordered by the ECB to stop all payments after a run on its deposits. The run was sparked by a sharp deterioration in ABLV\u2019s liquidity position since the US Treasury accused it of allowing clients to conduct business with North Korea.

      "bodyText": "Whenever the governor of the Reserve Bank speaks, all ears are pricked for any signs that might indicate where interest rates are headed. On Friday, when Philip Lowe appeared before the House economics committee, he was very careful with his words. The markets barely moved, and yet amid his unsurprising talk on interest rates he made some interesting points about the level of household debt that suggest he desires some quite significant changes in our economy. Right now households hold a record level of debt \u2013 equal to 188.4% of annual household income. A vast majority of that is housing debt. In September the level of housing debt had reached 137.5% of disposable income \u2013 a new record: To be honest, saying it is a new record is not news. In 22 of the past 23 quarters, a new record level of housing debt has been set. And this growth of debt is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Lowe noted in his testimony to the committee that lower expectations of income growth due to low wages growth is affecting households\u2019 spending \u2013 \u201cespecially in an environment of high levels of household debt\u201d. Basically, households are getting worried about the amount of debt they have and so are limiting how much they spend elsewhere. And while the total level of debt is of concern, the big issue has been the pace of its growth over the past few years, which has been at levels not seen since the heady mining boom days of 2006: When we look at the value of housing assets to income we see a similar record level: And a similar spike in the growth of the asset to income ratio over the past three years: This is a worry because when the price of assets keeps outstripping income growth you start getting into bubble territory. Lowe isn\u2019t too concerned about that because, as he told the committee, \u201cin the property market, prices are no longer rising in Sydney and they have fallen for some higher priced houses. The Melbourne market has also cooled a little\u201d. There are a few reasons that the heat has come out of the market \u2013 among them reduced ability for investors to access financing and a drop in foreign investment. Lowe then said something that seemed quite innocuous but that has a quite significant impact on how our economy will run. He suggested that \u201cit would be a good outcome if we now experienced a run of years in which the rate of growth of housing costs and debt did not outstrip growth in income, as they have in recent years\u201d. It is not too odd that he would like debt levels to stabilise \u2013 arguing for more record levels of debt would be a strange thing to wish for. But what he leaves unsaid is that, essentially, he would like to see our economy grow in a way it hasn\u2019t really ever done. Our economic growth since the 1990s recession has been largely built on household debt. When the level of debt in relation to income has not grown, this has generally meant the economy is in a slump \u2013 such as occurred in the early 1990s, during the GFC, and 2010-2013. A stable debt to income ratio has not necessarily meant we\u2019re in a recession, but it generally has not been an arbiter of good things. Mostly this is because we have structured our economy to engender higher house prices. Lowe was explicit on this point, telling the committee that \u201cif you asked anyone how a country would deliver high housing prices, you\u2019d find we\u2019ve made all those choices: live in fantastic coastal cities, under-invest in transport, have a liberal financial system, and not want high density\u201d. He argued that while this has led to high levels of debt, it has also led to high levels of asset prices, and he said the current situation was \u201cperfectly sustainable\u201d. He argued that \u201cabsent some major shock, I don\u2019t have a particular worry about it\u201d. And yet history shows that absent some major shock, debt levels have kept rising. In the past few years, while house prices \u2013 and debt \u2013 have risen, the level of interest payments being made on that debt has fallen as interest rates have gone down: The current level of interest payments is the same as it was in 2004 \u2013 but whereas total housing debt back then was 100% of annual disposable income, now it is more than a third higher at 137.5%. That means increases in interest rates are going to have a bigger impact than they did in the past \u2013 so it is very unlikely interest rates will be able to go up like they did prior to the GFC; whereas a 7.25% cash rate in 2008 slowed the economy, now it would destroy it. And it means the RBA has to be more careful about raising interest rates than in the past. The governor of the Reserve Bank is not worried at the moment about our economy being destroyed, but he sees a path that would make a major change from what has occurred in the past 30 years of a solidly growing economy accompanied with rising levels of debt. The question is \u2013 can we achieve strong economic growth without also increasing debt? And if so, can we achieve that with our current housing policy?",

A vast majority of that is housing debt. In September the level of housing debt had reached 137.5% of disposable income \u2013 a new record:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Housing debt to income ratio\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uWsRQ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>To be honest, saying it is a new record is not news. In 22 of the past 23 quarters, a new record level of housing debt has been set. And this growth of debt is having an impact on other areas of the economy.</p> <p>Lowe noted in his testimony to the committee that lower expectations of income growth due to low wages growth is affecting households\u2019 spending \u2013 \u201cespecially in an environment of high levels of household debt\u201d. </p> <p>Basically, households are getting worried about the amount of debt they have and so are limiting how much they spend elsewhere. </p> <p>And while the total level of debt is of concern, the big issue has been the pace of its growth over the past few years, which has been at levels not seen since the heady mining boom days of 2006:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"3 year growth of debt to income ratios\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eQ2d7/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>When we look at the value of housing assets to income we see a similar record level:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Households assets to income ratio\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NWzZT/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And a similar spike in the growth of the asset to income ratio over the past three years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"3 year growth of households assets to income ratio\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0IN3H/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This is a worry because when the price of assets keeps outstripping income growth you start getting into bubble territory. </p> <p>Lowe isn\u2019t too concerned about that because, as he told the committee, \u201cin the property market, prices are no longer rising in Sydney and they have fallen for some higher priced houses. The Melbourne market has also cooled a little\u201d. There are a few reasons that the heat has come out of the market \u2013 among them reduced ability for investors to access financing and a drop in foreign investment.</p> <p>Lowe then said something that seemed quite innocuous but that has a quite significant impact on how our economy will run. He suggested that \u201cit would be a good outcome if we now experienced a run of years in which the rate of growth of housing costs and debt did not outstrip growth in income, as they have in recent years\u201d.</p> <p>It is not too odd that he would like debt levels to stabilise \u2013 arguing for more record levels of debt would be a strange thing to wish for.

      "bodyText": "More than 260 workers have lost their jobs at the meat supplier Russell Hume, which has collapsed into administration just weeks after production was suspended following a food standards scare. Administrators announced 266 redundancies on Monday from the 302 employees at the company, which has its headquarters in Derby and operates from six production sites in Liverpool, Birmingham, London, Boroughbridge in North Yorkshire, Exeter and Fife. It is expected that all the company\u2019s employees will eventually lose their jobs. Meat products were prevented from leaving the group\u2019s factories last month after Food Standards Agency (FSA) inspectors found \u201cserious non-compliance with food hygiene regulations\u201d during a surprise visit to the Birmingham premises. Jamie Oliver\u2019s Italian restaurant chain and Wetherspoon were among the major restaurants and pub groups that were customers of Russell Hume. The company\u2019s demise comes after the pork company Fairfax Meadow voluntarily recalled meat products earlier this month after an unannounced inspection revealed issues with use-by date labelling. Meanwhile, in September, a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation into 2 Sisters Food Group resulted in the country\u2019s largest supplier of supermarket chicken suspending production at its West Bromwich plant for five weeks. Chris Pole, a partner at KPMG and a Russell Hume administrator, said: \u201cThe recent product recall and halt in operations has caused significant customer attrition and trading difficulties, which in turn has led the directors to take the decision to place the company into administration. \u201cRegrettably, with little prospect of production restarting on site, a total of 266 people have been made redundant. Our priority over the coming days will be to work with all affected employees to provide the assistance they need in claiming monies owed from the redundancy payments office. \u201cWe will also be seeking buyers for the business and its assets.\u201d The Russell Hume directors said the firm had an unblemished record before the investigation and a number of businesses had experienced \u201cissues\u201d with FSA investigations. They claimed there was a lack of clarity throughout the industry concerning FSA guidelines. Earlier this month, the FSA said it was launching a nationwide review of all meat cutting plants in the wake of serious incidents at 2 Sisters and Russell Hume. The FSA was criticised by a committee of MPs for failing to take \u201cdefinite action\u201d to improve food standards after the Guardian and ITV investigation last year.",

      "bodyText": "Reckitt Benckiser, the owner of brands including Durex and Nurofen, missed its 2017 profit expectations and said tough trading in developed markets and rising commodity costs were set to continue. The consumer goods group reported higher sales in the last quarter on Monday, in line with expectations, and forecast an increase for this year as it looks to move on from a turbulent 2017. It pointed to an improved performance at its recently acquired Mead Johnson baby formula business, and raised its forecast for cost savings from that deal to about $300m (\u00a3215m), up from the $250m announced at the time of the acquisition. However, 2017 earnings at the company, which has struggled with the weakest performance in its history, missed expectations and its profit margins declined, hurt by a tougher pricing environment in developed markets and increased commodity costs. It forecast both of those issues to continue in the near term. It declined to give a margin target for 2018, but said the year would be affected by the restructuring of its business into two units, which it completed in January, and the integration of Mead Johnson. Reckitt\u2019s shares were down 6.6% at about 2pm UK time on Monday, the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Like-for-like sales rose 2% in the fourth quarter, helped by a \u201cstrong flu season\u201d. That was roughly in line with analysts\u2019 average estimate. But the growth was driven more by volume than pricing. Reckitt said pricing power tailed off over the past year, with large retail customers under pressure from online competitors. It said the pressure was worse in its hygiene business than in health. Adrian Hennah, its chief financial officer, said: \u201cWe absolutely do not see this as a long-term pressure, but we also do not see it going away in the very short term.\u201d Mead Johnson sales rose 3%, its second quarter of growth after nine of decline. Reckitt was also less affected by certain one-time items, such as a failed product launch and a safety scandal in South Korea, which hurt sales in earlier quarters. It was also hit by a cyber-attack last year. Like-for-like sales were flat for the full year, in line with the company\u2019s forecast. For 2018, the company forecast revenue up 13-14%, with like-for-like sales up 2-3%. It stood by its medium-term target for \u201cmoderate operating margin expansion\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "As cash becomes less prominent in the UK, a range of businesses, charities and cash-dependent social groups are figuring out ways to adapt. Ross Brown, owner of Browns of Brockley in south-east London, one of the capital\u2019s cash-free cafes I had been on holiday to Stockholm and Denmark with my girlfriend and our son and realised on returning to the UK that we just hadn\u2019t taken out any cash \u2013 which I thought was pretty cool considering we went to lots of little, independent coffee shops. I got to thinking what it would be like if we didn\u2019t use cash any more at work. We already had a relatively high number of card transactions, probably around 60-70% of all transactions. I also hate going to the bank and constantly counting coins and notes every day, and weekly cashing up and banking was at least half a day\u2019s work. There\u2019s also safety \u2013 I feel much more comfortable now that we don\u2019t have thousands of pounds stashed somewhere in the building. In terms of transaction fees, we don\u2019t really lose out because there is an associated cost in accepting cash. I also like the fact that by only accepting cards there is the underlying message to our customers that we declare everything we accept. I\u2019m not anti-tax: I\u2019m proud to employ people, pay them properly and contribute to the economy and society. Jennifer Smith, director of Ryedale Folk Museum, Hutton le Hole, North Yorkshire We are still frequently asked by visitors on arrival if we take cards. Perhaps this is more to do with the demographic of our visitors than anything else. Visitors are often relieved when they hear a yes \u2013 because often they are not carrying cash. It\u2019s worth saying that the closure of bank branches nearby has clearly had an effect on people carrying cash \u2013 and may be more likely to force more cashless transactions. Like the rest of the rural businesses I know, we take card transactions using a card machine with a landline. The connection is slow and we often joke with our customers about how things are a little slower out in the countryside. We are considering moving to a system that needs an internet connection for card payments. There are certainly cost savings with this sort of system. However, I am still reluctant, because of the speed and unreliability of the internet here. Dave Southern, puppeteer and street performer, Cheshire I\u2019ve been a street performer for 40 years and although our artistic community has been discussing the impact of the \u201ccashless society\u201d for the last five years, I\u2019ve yet to see any impact on my income: often, if people don\u2019t have any cash on them, they go to a cashpoint and take some out \u2013 then they come back and pay me. There are buskers who set up PayPal accounts and have QR codes (a contactless payment method scanned by smartphones using a downloadable app) but that\u2019s all a bit hi-tech for me. It also depends on where you\u2019re performing and how long you perform for: in London, where bases are very competitive, costly and you only get an hour to perform, it makes sense to get a QR code. But I\u2019d prefer to stay in Chester and perform in a relaxed way for three hours, and get the same amount in cash as I\u2019d get in a single, pressured hour in London. Having said that, contactless mobile units aren\u2019t ideal in London either because you have to get off your pitch on time and can\u2019t hang around fiddling with contactless payments. It\u2019s that interaction and relationship which is why cash survives in street performance: sticking a contactless payment device in people\u2019s faces isn\u2019t the same as the familiar hat. Deborah Myers, head of development, National Gallery I have seen a fluctuation in cash donations in recent years and so we have put in place arrangements to encourage people to make contactless donations. In October 2016, we installed contactless donation terminals in the gallery, which took a flat rate donation of \u00a35. It\u2019s been fairly successful: about 3-7% of our donations are now made by card. We\u2019re currently doing a more proactive trial where employees carrying mobile phone payment devices warmly welcome visitors and remind them that the gallery relies on donations. That\u2019s going very well \u2013 we\u2019ve definitely seen an increase in donations as a result of it. People donate more when they pay with a card compared to cash \u2013 the average cash donation is \u00a34 to \u00a35 but donations made by card are at the higher end of that and, sometimes, a bit more. Ilan Slazenger, manager of Clown Town soft play, Finchley, north London We\u2019ve been going for 21 years and have been cash-only for all that time. Sometimes it\u2019s a nuisance for customers who don\u2019t realise and we feel bad about having to ask them to go to a local cashpoint. We\u2019ve resisted moving to contactless pay because every time we looked into it, we were shocked by how much it cost. The transaction costs for credit cards are the worst: it\u2019s 2.5%, but even debit cards aren\u2019t free and would mean that we would lose all profit on some of the lower cost items in the cafe. We have lots of regular customers for whom a few extra pence on the entrance fee would really make a difference to them. In the last six months, however, we\u2019ve had a change of heart. This is obviously where things are going and the more we thought of the pros and cons, we decided that it would actually advantage us to allow ourselves to be dragged into the modern age. For a start, we won\u2019t have cash floating around the venue, or lose money through fraudulent notes, and also won\u2019t have to spend hours counting up the cash and taking it to the bank every week. Drug dealer People always go on about how the cashless society will spell the end of drug dealing but although I started selling for cash on the street, my trade has been entirely online for the last couple of years at least. There are different ways customers can pay for drugs on the darknet. They can use Bitcoins, localbitcoins, virtual private networks or [an operating system called] Tails. Buying on the darknet is more risky for dealers than customers. Compared to selling on the street, the darknet is easier and safer for me \u2013 and also more profitable because I sell in bulk rather than dealing with individual pills and small bags of weed. And because I\u2019m selling in bulk, my prices are lower than when I dealt on the street, so it\u2019s a win-win. I\u2019ve heard some people say the darknet is the next generation of drug dealing. But from where I\u2019m looking, it\u2019s this generation\u2019s way of buying drugs. Cash never comes anywhere near buyer or seller, so all the government\u2019s promises that the cashless society would outlaw drug dealing are a lie. Margaret Cave, vicar of Christ Church in East Dulwich, south London We were part of the church\u2019s recent six-month-long national card reader trial and although the trial is over, I\u2019m certainly not giving my card reader back! If I had my way, we\u2019d be a cash-free church. We use contactless payments for marriage banns money and wedding deposits, taking payments for the church weekend away, and one-off larger donations. And it\u2019s nice just to feel part of the 21st century. When a young couple come in to discuss their marriage banns, which cost \u00a343, I no longer have to send them over the road to the cashpoint. Also, if people are giving money by card, there\u2019s no question that any of it is going to go missing. It\u2019s more tax effective for them and also helps them donate in a planned way. John Montague, Big Issue managing director Sellers are increasingly saying to us that they want to go digital because potential customers are increasingly saying they can\u2019t buy the magazine because they\u2019re not carrying cash. This is happening in every major city in the UK where we sell the magazine. Enabling our vendors to move to a cashless payment system is our top priority for this year but we still don\u2019t know how we can get it done. We\u2019re in talks with MasterCard, Visa and the banks but the problem is finding a solution that works for all our vendors: a system that enables vendors to access their money immediately, so they can pay for a bed that night, rather than wait one to two business days for the money to land in their bank account. We also need to work out what to do for vendors who don\u2019t have bank accounts, and those who sell papers in areas with poor wifi connectivity. Rafe Jaffrey, Indian food stallholder at Bloomsbury market in London I started using cashless payments in October and it\u2019s been such a success that I don\u2019t know why I waited so long! I\u2019ve been watching increasing numbers of stallholders at Bloomsbury Market using contactless pay over the last few years but assumed it would be really complicated and expensive to set up. I eventually took the plunge because there were ever-increasing numbers of customers who asked me if I took cards \u2013 and increasing numbers of those asking where the nearest cashpoint was because they didn\u2019t have any cash on them. It turns out that it\u2019s not expensive or complicated at all \u2013 and I\u2019d say that it immediately increased my turnover by about one-sixth: people just don\u2019t carry cash on them nowadays. Even if they go out intending to go to a farmers\u2019 market, they won\u2019t carry enough cash on them to buy everything they end up wanting. The only potential problem with contactless payment is if I had my stall at a festival somewhere so obscure that there wasn\u2019t any phone cover. But that would have to be a pretty obscure festival \u2013 all the ones I know of have cover.",

I also like the fact that by only accepting cards there is the underlying message to our customers that we declare everything we accept. I\u2019m not anti-tax: I\u2019m proud to employ people, pay them properly and contribute to the economy and society.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/19/peak-cash-over-uk-rise-of-debit-cards-unbanked-contactless-payments\">Revealed: Cash eclipsed as Britain turns to digital payments</a> </p> </aside>  <p> </p> <h2>Jennifer Smith, director of Ryedale Folk Museum, Hutton le Hole, North Yorkshire</h2> <p>We are still frequently asked by visitors on arrival if we take cards. Perhaps this is more to do with the demographic of our visitors than anything else.</p> <p>Visitors are often relieved when they hear a yes \u2013 because often they are not carrying cash. It\u2019s worth saying that the closure of bank branches nearby has clearly had an effect on people carrying cash \u2013 and may be more likely to force more cashless transactions.</p> <p>Like the rest of the rural businesses I know, we take card transactions using a card machine with a landline. The connection is slow and we often joke with our customers about how things are a little slower out in the countryside. </p> <p>We are considering moving to a system that needs an internet connection for card payments. There are certainly cost savings with this sort of system. However, I am still reluctant, because of the speed and unreliability of the internet here.</p> <h2>Dave Southern, puppeteer and street performer, Cheshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d367bdedc3271188d4ab9618a0c28f118ad9855d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d367bdedc3271188d4ab9618a0c28f118ad9855d/0_38_3291_1975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dave Southern\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Puppeteer and street performer Dave Southern performing with Mr Peewee in Chester city centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been a street performer for 40 years and although our artistic community has been discussing the impact of the \u201ccashless society\u201d for the last five years, I\u2019ve yet to see any impact on my income: often, if people don\u2019t have any cash on them, they go to a cashpoint and take some out \u2013 then they come back and pay me. </p> <p>There are buskers who set up PayPal accounts and have QR codes (a contactless payment method scanned by smartphones using a downloadable app) but that\u2019s all a bit hi-tech for me. It also depends on where you\u2019re performing and how long you perform for: in London, where bases are very competitive, costly and you only get an hour to perform, it makes sense to get a QR code. But I\u2019d prefer to stay in Chester and perform in a relaxed way for three hours, and get the same amount in cash as I\u2019d get in a single, pressured hour in London. Having said that, contactless mobile units aren\u2019t ideal in London either because you have to get off your pitch on time and can\u2019t hang around fiddling with contactless payments.</p> <p>It\u2019s that interaction and relationship which is why cash survives in street performance: sticking a contactless payment device in people\u2019s faces isn\u2019t the same as the familiar hat. </p> <h2>Deborah Myers, head of development, National Gallery </h2> <p>I have seen a fluctuation in cash donations in recent years and so we have put in place arrangements to encourage people to make contactless donations. </p> <p>In October 2016, we installed contactless donation terminals in the gallery, which took a flat rate donation of \u00a35. It\u2019s been fairly successful: about 3-7% of our donations are now made by card. We\u2019re currently doing a more proactive trial where employees carrying mobile phone payment devices warmly welcome visitors and remind them that the gallery relies on donations. That\u2019s going very well \u2013 we\u2019ve definitely seen an increase in donations as a result of it. </p> <p>People donate more when they pay with a card compared to cash \u2013 the average cash donation is \u00a34 to \u00a35 but donations made by card are at the higher end of that and, sometimes, a bit more. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <h2>Ilan Slazenger, manager of Clown Town soft play, Finchley, north London </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a762ee25e584ea07f9c4653be803dbe8fb79208f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a762ee25e584ea07f9c4653be803dbe8fb79208f/311_193_3939_2364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ilan Slazenger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ilan Slazenger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019ve been going for 21 years and have been cash-only for all that time. Sometimes it\u2019s a nuisance for customers who don\u2019t realise and we feel bad about having to ask them to go to a local cashpoint. We\u2019ve resisted moving to contactless pay because every time we looked into it, we were shocked by how much it cost. The transaction costs for credit cards are the worst: it\u2019s 2.5%, but even debit cards aren\u2019t free and would mean that we would lose all profit on some of the lower cost items in the cafe. We have lots of regular customers for whom a few extra pence on the entrance fee would really make a difference to them. </p> <p>In the last six months, however, we\u2019ve had a change of heart. This is obviously where things are going and the more we thought of the pros and cons, we decided that it would actually advantage us to allow ourselves to be dragged into the modern age.</p> <p>For a start, we won\u2019t have cash floating around the venue, or lose money through fraudulent notes, and also won\u2019t have to spend hours counting up the cash and taking it to the bank every week. </p> <h2>Drug dealer</h2> <p>People always go on about how the cashless society will spell the end of drug dealing but although I started selling for cash on the street, my trade has been entirely online for the last couple of years at least. There are different ways customers can pay for drugs on the darknet. They can use Bitcoins, localbitcoins, virtual private networks or [an operating system called] Tails. Buying on the darknet is more risky for dealers than customers. </p> <p>Compared to selling on the street, the darknet is easier and safer for me \u2013 and also more profitable because I sell in bulk rather than dealing with individual pills and small bags of weed. And because I\u2019m selling in bulk, my prices are lower than when I dealt on the street, so it\u2019s a win-win.</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard some people say the darknet is the next generation of drug dealing. But from where I\u2019m looking, it\u2019s this generation\u2019s way of buying drugs. Cash never comes anywhere near buyer or seller, so all the government\u2019s promises that the cashless society would outlaw drug dealing are a lie.</p> <h2>Margaret Cave, vicar of Christ Church in East Dulwich, south London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae70cbe42e7ba57a3b1dad4232086698353f6767\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae70cbe42e7ba57a3b1dad4232086698353f6767/0_384_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Cave\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Cave.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We were part of the church\u2019s recent six-month-long national card reader trial and although the trial is over, I\u2019m certainly not giving my card reader back! If I had my way, we\u2019d be a cash-free church.</p> <p>We use contactless payments for marriage banns money and wedding deposits, taking payments for the church weekend away, and one-off larger donations. And it\u2019s nice just to feel part of the 21st century. When a young couple come in to discuss their marriage banns, which cost \u00a343, I no longer have to send them over the road to the cashpoint.</p> <p>Also, if people are giving money by card, there\u2019s no question that any of it is going to go missing. It\u2019s more tax effective for them and also helps them donate in a planned way. </p> <h2>John Montague, Big Issue managing director</h2> <p>Sellers are increasingly saying to us that they want to go digital because potential customers are increasingly saying they can\u2019t buy the magazine because they\u2019re not carrying cash. This is happening in every major city in the UK where we sell the magazine.</p> <p>Enabling our vendors to move to a cashless payment system is our top priority for this year but we still don\u2019t know how we can get it done. We\u2019re in talks with MasterCard, Visa and the banks but the problem is finding a solution that works for all our vendors: a system that enables vendors to access their money immediately, so they can pay for a bed that night, rather than wait one to two business days for the money to land in their bank account. </p> <p>We also need to work out what to do for vendors who don\u2019t have bank accounts, and those who sell papers in areas with poor wifi connectivity.</p> <h2>Rafe Jaffrey, Indian food stallholder at Bloomsbury market in London<strong></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d8d77597e5cafed901fb391915fdf40e1e21e85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d8d77597e5cafed901fb391915fdf40e1e21e85/1164_1089_4672_2802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafe Jaffrey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafe Jaffrey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I started using cashless payments in October and it\u2019s been such a success that I don\u2019t know why I waited so long! I\u2019ve been watching increasing numbers of stallholders at Bloomsbury Market using contactless pay over the last few years but assumed it would be really complicated and expensive to set up. I eventually took the plunge because there were ever-increasing numbers of customers who asked me if I took cards \u2013 and increasing numbers of those asking where the nearest cashpoint was because they didn\u2019t have any cash on them.</p> <p>It turns out that it\u2019s not expensive or complicated at all \u2013 and I\u2019d say that it immediately increased my turnover by about one-sixth: people just don\u2019t carry cash on them nowadays.

      "bodyText": "The number of UK restaurants going bust jumped by a fifth last year as major chains came under pressure from rising costs and competition amid a squeeze on consumer spending. There were nearly 1,000 insolvencies across the restaurant industry in 2017 compared with 825 the year before, according to law firm Moore Stephens. Casualties included the Handmade Burger Co chain and Liverpool-based Viva Brazil Steakhouse which was later bought out in a rescue deal. The pain has continued into 2018 with Jamie\u2019s Italian planning to close 12 of its 37 UK branches as part of a rescue package, while burger chain Byron is to close up to 20 restaurants \u2013 nearly a third of its outlets \u2013 in a similar deal. Earlier this month, specialist chain Square Pie closed off all five of its remaining sites after going into administration. \u201cPressure on the restaurant sector is now hitting even the biggest names on the high street,\u201d said Jeremy Willmont, head of restructuring at Moore Stephens. \u201cThe jump in insolvencies over the last year demonstrates just how tough the current economic conditions are for the restaurant trade.\u201d The rise in the legal minimum wage and low availability of staff prompted by fewer Europeans coming to the UK in the wake of the Brexit vote have increased the challenges. The fall in the value of the pound has made potential take-home pay less attractive for European workers and increased the price of food and other essentials for restaurateurs. \u201cRunning a restaurant business is becoming increasingly challenging. Employment costs are rising and the market in areas such as London is becoming ever more saturated,\u201d Willmont said. Fears are growing that Jamie Oliver\u2019s Barbecoa chain of steak restaurants could soon fall into administration. Oliver recently put both branches of the upmarket barbecue chain up for sale, but has yet to find a buyer. Des Gunewardena, co-owner of D&amp;D, the group behind about 30 high-end London restaurants including Le Pont de la Tour, Coq D\u2019Argent and Quaglino\u2019s, said trading was tough across the industry amid rising wage bills and other costs. He said D&amp;D\u2019s sales were rising by a few percent in London but increasing costs were impacting business. While the upper end of the market in London is facing less pressure than the chain-led casual dining sector where private equity fuelled a wave of expansion in recent years, Gunewardena said D&amp;D was now \u201crebalancing\u201d investment outside the capital. \u201cWe are hedging our bets. We have a lot of projects we\u2019ve been offered in London but we are also opening three of our biggest ventures elsewhere. \u201cIt could be that regional cities prosper more than London over the next 20 years. There is no evidence that London is not going to continue growing but we are in uncertain economic times when governments could change things fundamentally.\u201d The group, which launches its first Manchester outlet, 20 Stories, later this month, opened its first regional British outlets in 2013 \u2013 Angelica and Crafthouse in Leeds\u2019 Trinity shopping centre. D&amp;D is also opening a branch of its Bluebird restaurant in Time Warner Centre overlooking Central Park in New York this summer, and has announced plans for a restaurant at the Hudson Yards development which is expected to open next spring. The two openings will be the group\u2019s first in the US since founder Terence Conran opened Guastavino\u2019s in 2000, and the current owners\u2019 first new overseas venture for more than a decade.",

    "webTitle": "Carillion shareholders considered suing after profit warning", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A major investment firm that owned 10% of Carillion has told MPs it considered suing the the collapsed government contractor over suspicions that directors knew it was in difficulty earlier than they admitted in public. Kiltearn Partners says it \u201cconsidered participation in civil legal action against Carillion with a view to recovering a proportion of its clients\u2019 crystallised losses\u201d following its profits warning last summer. Kiltearn is one of a group of former shareholders who have submitted evidence to the parliamentary committees which are conducting an inquiry into Carillion\u2019s failure. This evidence was released on Monday, as MPs prepare to question the company\u2019s auditor KPMG at a hearing on Thursday. Two investment institutions said they believed managers had been underplaying the deterioration in Carillion\u2019s finances before it announced an \u00a3845m writedown of key contracts and issued a profit warning in July last year. Edinburgh-based Kiltearn added that it was monitoring an investigation by the accounting watchdog the Financial Reporting Council to see if KPMG, which took \u00a320m in fees from Carillion over 10 years, breached \u201cethical and technical standards\u201d. Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, said investors\u2019 evidence suggested a \u201cdisconnect\u201d with testimony given by directors, including the former chief executive Richard Howson, who told MPs that Carillion suffered a rapid downturn in key contracts in regions including Qatar in spring 2018. \u201cOn one hand the Carillion directors told us all was sunny until a bolt of Qatari lightning hit them out of the blue,\u201d Field said. \u201cTheir stewardship had, they proudly told us, been adjudged \u2018best in class\u2019 by their friends at KPMG. \u201cOn the other hand, investors were fleeing for the hills and it appears those who looked closest ran fastest.\u201d Rachel Reeves, chair of the Commons business committee, said: \u201cInvestors spotted that Carillion was heading for disaster and fled. KPMG will have to explain why they signed off on accounts which appeared to bear so little relation to reality.\u201d Reeves and Field last week accused accountants of \u201cfeasting\u201d on Carillion after they admitted accepting \u00a372m of fees over 10 years from the company. KPMG has defended its audit of the company\u2019s finances. In a lengthy submission ahead of the inquiry\u2019s second evidence session, Kiltearn said it decided to sell shares because it was \u201cnot clear what future cash flows would be as there was no concrete information on critical factors\u201d. The company added that even Carillion\u2019s annual reports could \u201cno longer be considered reliable\u201d and that the company had become \u201cimpossible to value\u201d. Kiltearn owned a 10th of Carillion\u2019s shares last summer, but began selling after the July 2017 profit warning.

The positive public signal from the Labor leader on the future of coal followed a warning last week by the CFMEU\u2019s national president, Tony Maher, that any move by Labor to block Adani\u2019s controversial Carmichael coalmine would expose Labor politically in Queensland, and open a divisive debate within the ALP about the future of coalmines in Australia. Maher told Guardian Australia last week that promising to block the Adani project would raise questions, like \u201cwhat do you do with the next [coalmine], and the next one, and the one after that?\u201d Shorten has sent a number of clear public signals since the end of January that Labor intends to toughen its position on the Adani project, and policy work has been under way internally since before Christmas. But despite all the signalling \u2013 which started just before the resignation of the Labor MP David Feeney, a development triggering a byelection in the inner-Melbourne electorate of Batman, where local anti-Adani sentiment is a significant issue \u2013 thus far the federal ALP has not revealed any detail about how it might move to stop the project. In Townsville on Monday, Shorten told local reporters there was a role for mining in Australia, and \u201cthere is a role for coal in Australia\u201d and he echoed Maher\u2019s description of Adani as just \u201canother project\u201d. Last week, Maher told Guardian Australia: \u201cI see no reason for Labor to toughen its position. Why win Batman and lose in central Queensland?\u201d \u201cThe environment groups have worked themselves up into a passion about [Adani]. I don\u2019t know why. Adani is just another project and it should be judged on its merits.\u201d In Adelaide the shadow infrastructure minister, Anthony Albanese, told 5AA that Labor had not taken any decision to oppose the mine. \u201cThat\u2019s not the decision that we have made,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cWe have certainly been very questioning about the project, about its financial viability, whether it will go ahead. \u201cWe\u2019ve been quite rightly questioning about the impact on water and some of the environmental consequences of the project,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Labor has to stand up for Labor values and one of the things about Labor values is about jobs and making sure the economy can function.\u201d Shorten said in Townsville, while unveiling an expansion of the local port, that Labor would stand up for \u201creal blue-collar jobs\u201d and the next \u201cpipeline of work\u201d. He said of the Adani project that it was highly unlikely to get finance, and the promised jobs associated with the project had not materialised. The Labor leader said his party\u2019s position on Adani was it \u201chas to stack up commercially and environmentally\u201d. There are a range of views within federal Labor about what to do about Adani. Labor sources have told Guardian Australia that internal consideration on legal mechanisms to potentially stop Adani remains ongoing, but the party is also focused on sending a clear message to Queensland that Labor will produce a regional industry policy that blue-collar workers can believe in. The ALP and the Greens will go head to head in Batman, and anti-Adani activist groups are already active in the contest. Melbourne voters go to the polls on 17 March.",

      "bodyText": "The average price of a UK property coming on to the market has risen by more than \u00a32,400 in a month to just over \u00a3300,000 amid evidence of \u201crecord\u201d levels of house-hunting activity, according to Rightmove. The website, which tracks 90% of the UK property market, said the national average asking price for a home had increased by 0.8% during the past month, following the 0.7% rise it reported in mid-January. However, some sellers may be over-pricing their properties: the average time to sell has risen once again and is now 72 days, compared with 67 days a month ago and 55 during the summer of 2017. In London, the average has climbed to 83 days. Rightmove said that while it was the norm for new sellers\u2019 asking prices to be buoyant at the start of a new year, \u201cthis first complete month in 2018 is seeing more pricing optimism than the comparable period in 2017\u201d. In general, however, sellers were not being over-ambitious or setting too high a price, it added. The website, which claims to display a stock of more than one million properties to buy or rent, said the average asking price now stood at \u00a3300,001, compared with \u00a3297,587 a month ago. It described January as its \u201cbusiest month ever\u201d, with a record 141m website visits. In all the UK regions it tracks, the typical price of a newly-marketed property rose during the past month, with the exception of south-west England, where the figure slipped back slightly. Scotland saw the biggest monthly increase, at 5.1%, while the north-east and Wales managed 3.6% and 3.5%. However, on a national basis, the annual rate of price growth \u201cremains subdued\u201d at 1.5%, said the website. Separate Rightmove data for London show that the city\u2019s 32 boroughs have enjoyed mixed fortunes. In Lambeth, asking prices have fallen by 1.4% during the past month, and are down 7.3% on 12 months ago. The average price there is \u00a3635,376. Other London boroughs where typical asking prices have fallen during the past four to five weeks include Tower Hamlets (down 1.2%), Hounslow (down 0.8%) and Brent (down 0.6%). The figures may also indicate that the areas of London that are home to the most expensive properties are bouncing back from some of their lows; or that some sellers are being greedy. In Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea \u2014 the two boroughs where the typical price tag is above \u00a31m \u2014 asking prices jumped 3.8% and 2.5% during the past month.",

In general, however, sellers were not being over-ambitious or setting too high a price, it added.<br></p> <p>The website, which claims to display a stock of more than one million properties to buy or rent, said the average asking price now stood at \u00a3300,001, compared with \u00a3297,587 a month ago. It described January as its \u201cbusiest month ever\u201d, with a record 141m website visits.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c7dec48d0f8376382c9d8279358c114d04ca9f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c7dec48d0f8376382c9d8279358c114d04ca9f7/0_0_660_369/500.png\" alt=\"Monthly asking prices\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In all the UK regions it tracks, the typical price of a newly-marketed property rose during the past month, with the exception of south-west England, where the figure slipped back slightly. Scotland saw the biggest monthly increase, at 5.1%, while the north-east and Wales managed 3.6% and 3.5%.<br></p> <p>However, on a national basis, the annual rate of price growth \u201cremains subdued\u201d at 1.5%, said the website.<br></p> <p>Separate Rightmove data for London show that the city\u2019s 32 boroughs have enjoyed mixed fortunes. In Lambeth, asking prices have fallen by 1.4% during the past month, and are down 7.3% on 12 months ago. The average price there is \u00a3635,376.</p> <p>Other London boroughs where typical asking prices have fallen during the past four to five weeks include Tower Hamlets (down 1.2%), Hounslow (down 0.8%) and Brent (down 0.6%).<br></p> <p> The figures may also indicate that the areas of London that are home to the most expensive properties are bouncing back from some of their lows; or that some sellers are being greedy. In Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea \u2014 the two boroughs where the typical price tag is above \u00a31m \u2014 asking prices jumped 3.8% and 2.5% during the past month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>",
