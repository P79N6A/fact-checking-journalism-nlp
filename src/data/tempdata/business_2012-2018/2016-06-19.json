      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson is stepping up his pro-EU efforts, launching a nationwide campaign to urge people to back remain and warning of the economic and political pitfalls of a Brexit vote. The billionaire founder of the Virgin empire \u2013 who does not have the right to vote in the UK \u2013 is launching the campaign on Monday. He lives in the British Virgin Islands but pointed out that the Virgin businesses, which span financial services and gyms, employ 50,000 people in the UK. Branson said: \u201cAs an entrepreneur I have been known for taking risks throughout my career, but leaving the European Union is not one of the risks I would want the UK to take \u2013 not as an investor, not as a father and not as a grandfather. I am deeply concerned about the impact of leaving.\u201d He has registered his campaign with the Electoral Commission, which suggests he intends to spend more than \u00a310,000 on his efforts to win support for the remain side. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve been living in the British Virgin Islands for some time now, I have never stopped caring passionately about the UK and its great people,\u201d Branson said. He also pointed to other benefits of the EU, saying: \u201cMy father Ted fought in North Africa, Italy and Germany during world war two. My grandfather survived the horrors of the trenches in world war one. I truly believe that one of the EU\u2019s greatest achievements is that it has kept its members out of conflict in Europe.\u201d The business community is not unanimous on remaining in the EU, however, with 37 pro-Brexit business leaders writing in the Sun on Sunday to say the country can survive outside the \u201cenergy-sapping\u201d European project. A Virgin spokesperson said: \u201cRichard has lived overseas for some years and so he\u2019s not on the electoral register.

The billionaire businessman \u2013 who last week appeared before MPs to be questioned on his role in the demise of BHS, which has put 11,000 jobs at risk \u2013 is apparently now the owner of an upgraded jet the manufacturer\u2019s website says comes with handcrafted seats and divans, widescreen TVs and porcelain dinnerware as standard. Photographs and reports shared online by aeroplane enthusiasts suggest the jet was delivered to the UK in early April, and that it has already been used for flights between London and Monaco, where Green\u2019s family is based. On Sunday, it flew from Luton to Nice. Described as Gulfstream\u2019s \u201choly grail of private jets\u201d, the original G650 was the largest and fastest of the firm\u2019s business jets. The ER is the updated version, and has a list price of $66.5m (\u00a346m). The new jet, which can fly non-stop from Hong Kong to New York, was delivered just weeks before the Green family\u2019s new superyacht \u2013 a four-storey 90-metre vessel built in Italy that is understood to have cost the billionaire \u00a3100m. They have arrived at a time when Green is facing questions about a \u00a3571m hole in the BHS pension fund following the sale of the department store business to Dominic Chappell for \u00a31 in March 2015. Green\u2019s family received hundreds of millions from BHS in dividends and rent. The department store collapsed into administration just 13 months later, and the staff now face losing their jobs and pension cuts. Green\u2019s jet purchase was reported in the Sun on Sunday, which quoted a source who said: \u201cIt\u2019s the most luxurious private jet on the planet, the fastest of its kind. Most employees at BHS will struggle to even pay for a budget flight to Spain this summer. So the idea he\u2019s splashing out on this will be hard to stomach.\u201d Green told the Guardian he was not talking to the media about the report. The Sun reported that Green\u2019s wife, Tina, was spending \u00a3300,000 on the interior. Passengers can to control the jet\u2019s temperature, lighting and window shades with their smartphones and tablets. The pensions regulator is investigating whether Green, who is still chairman of Topshop\u2019s owner, Arcadia Group, should be forced to make contributions to the scheme. The subject was on the agenda when he appeared at the select committee hearing for six hours on Wednesday, when he told MPs he was working on a solution that would involve BHS workers getting a better deal than in the pension protection fund, under which they would suffer a 10% cut to their benefits.",

    "webTitle": "Referendum jitters hit value of UK stock market flotations", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stock market flotations by British companies have slumped in 2016 because of fears about the outcome of the referendum on EU membership and the slowing economy. Funds raised by UK companies have fallen to $3.3bn (\u00a32.3bn) so far this year, down from more than $8bn in each of the preceding two half-year periods, Thomson Reuters figures show. The figure is the lowest since the second half of 2012, when companies raised $2.9bn, and the third lowest since the second half of 2008 when the financial crisis reached its peak. The value of UK flotations has almost halved so far in the current quarter to $1.14bn from $2.15bn in the first three months of 2016, as the EU referendum has drawn nearer. By contrast, the value of global IPOs has taken off, rising to $22.7bn so far in the current quarter from $8.9bn in a slow first three months of the year. Viv Maclachlan, a capital markets director at the accountancy firm PwC, said companies had delayed going to the market because they feared wary investors would push the price of new shares down with markets in turmoil ahead of the EU referendum vote. \u201cThe reason is absolutely the EU referendum and that has been pretty much the case since the beginning of April. People don\u2019t like uncertainty and I don\u2019t think investors, companies or any of us understand the ramifications of what it means if we leave,\u201d she said. \u201cInvestors don\u2019t want to pay for things while there is uncertainty and the danger is you might be forced to undervalue your company.\u201d The IPO slowdown is the latest sign of jitters in the financial world over the outcome of the referendum with polls suggesting a very close contest. The health of the market is a measure of wider business confidence. In the second half of 2008, when Lehman Brothers went bust, no UK companies floated on the stock market as investors were seized by fear of economic disaster. The FTSE 100 index sank to a four-month low last week before recovering slightly, and the pound has fallen heavily against the dollar. UK equity funds had their second largest withdrawals on record, the eighth straight week, as investors sold $1.1bn of shares in British companies. Merger and acquisition activity has also fallen to a three-year low and at 4% is the lowest proportion of worldwide takeovers on record, according to Thomson Reuters. William Charnley, a partner at the law firm King &amp; Spalding, said: \u201cIn the short term, Brexit would increase uncertainty and would continue to limit investor demand for risk assets and therefore continue to inhibit capital raising.\u201d He said the EU referendum was part of the reason for the fall in IPO activity, but that the slowing economy also played a role. UK growth slowed sharply in the first quarter of this year as weaker global trade, reflected in low oil prices, and turbulence in financial markets reduced economic activity. \u201cWe are in a low-growth environment in which capital spending is not the main focus, so there is less need to raise money,\u201d he said. \u201cSignificantly, there is less investment internationally in resources and energy. Also, the pace of development in the corporate sector is slow, which is due to the dynamics of the real economy.\u201d Companies that have floated so far this year include Hotel Chocolat, the clothing brand Joules and the listings and city guides publisher Time Out. All three achieved the valuations they were seeking, but others such as Metro Bank, CMC Markets and Countryside Properties had to sell shares at the low end of their mooted price range. After peaking in 2006, flotations slumped in the years after the financial crisis, but the market sprang back to life in 2013 as the economy picked up and the government sold 60% of Royal Mail. Activity reached record levels in the first half of 2014 as companies including AO World, Pets at Home and Poundland raised a total of $17.1bn.",

By contrast, the value of global IPOs has taken off, rising to $22.7bn so far in the current quarter from $8.9bn in a slow first three months of the year.<br></p> <p>Viv Maclachlan, a capital markets director at the accountancy firm PwC, said companies had delayed going to the market because they feared wary investors would push the price of new shares down with markets in turmoil ahead of the EU referendum vote.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason is absolutely the EU referendum and that has been pretty much the case since the beginning of April. People don\u2019t like uncertainty and I don\u2019t think investors, companies or any of us understand the ramifications of what it means if we leave,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cInvestors don\u2019t want to pay for things while there is uncertainty and the danger is you might be forced to undervalue your company.\u201d</p> <p>The IPO slowdown is the latest sign of jitters in the financial world over the outcome of the referendum with polls suggesting a very close contest. The health of the market is a measure of wider business confidence. In the second half of 2008, when Lehman Brothers went bust, no UK companies floated on the stock market as investors were seized by fear of economic disaster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a60af5c1f1acb2f85fff0448052114bb10dd82b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a60af5c1f1acb2f85fff0448052114bb10dd82b5/153_76_1787_1072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hotel Chocolat chocolates\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Companies that have floated so far this year include Hotel Chocolat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Bond/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The FTSE 100 index sank to a four-month low last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/17/stock-market-rebounds-from-four-month-low\">before recovering slightly</a>, and the pound has fallen heavily against the dollar. UK equity funds had their second largest withdrawals on record, the eighth straight week, as investors sold $1.1bn of shares in British companies. </p> <p>Merger and acquisition activity has also fallen to a three-year low and at 4% is the lowest proportion of worldwide takeovers on record, according to Thomson Reuters.</p> <p>William Charnley, a partner at the law firm King &amp; Spalding, said: \u201cIn the short term, Brexit would increase uncertainty and would continue to limit investor demand for risk assets and therefore continue to inhibit capital raising.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said the EU referendum was part of the reason for the fall in IPO activity, but that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/01/oecd-warning-global-economy-factories-brexit-live\">the slowing economy</a> also played a role. UK growth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/27/uk-gdp-growth-slows-to-04-amid-eu-referendum-uncertainty\">slowed sharply in the first quarter of this year</a> as weaker global trade, reflected in low oil prices, and turbulence in financial markets reduced economic activity.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in a low-growth environment in which capital spending is not the main focus, so there is less need to raise money,\u201d he said. \u201cSignificantly, there is less investment internationally in resources and energy.

All three achieved the valuations they were seeking, but others such as Metro Bank, CMC Markets and Countryside Properties had to sell shares at the low end of their mooted price range.</p> <p>After peaking in 2006, flotations slumped in the years after the financial crisis, but the market <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/13/royal-mail-sale-success-fuels-ipo-craze\">sprang back to life in 2013</a> as the economy picked up and the government sold 60% of Royal Mail. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/08/britain-flotation-fever-record-year-ipos\">Activity reached record levels in the first half of 2014</a> as companies including AO World, Pets at Home and Poundland raised a total of $17.1bn.</p> <p> </p>",

      "bodyText": "It is now nearly nine years since the problems of three hedge funds heralded the arrival of global financial and economic chaos. Britain\u2019s EU referendum this week is the latest manifestation of that crisis. That is not the way the debate in the UK has been framed. For one side, the decision is all about taking back control, especially over immigration. For the other, it is about the potential consequences for the economy in general and individuals in particular. This narrow focus reflects the fact that the referendum has been a contest between two wings of the Conservative party, neither of which has any great love for the EU. Few of the bigger themes have been drawn out by this blue-on-blue affair. There is, however, an obvious reason why immigration has proved an effective weapon for the leave side. Life is tougher for millions of Britons on modest incomes than it was a decade ago. Contrast the state of the UK when the accession to the EU of Poland and other former Soviet bloc countries led to strong net migration in 2004. At that time, average earnings were growing by 4-5% a year, the Labour government was investing heavily in schools and hospitals and the eurozone appeared to be over its initial problems. A second big increase in net migration has occurred since the great recession of 2008 and 2009, but the economic and political environment has changed. Real earnings have been squeezed, the expansion of the public sector has been halted and the eurozone has been in a state of permanent crisis. The British economy has become increasingly dominated by the fortunes of the financial sector, with the bankers responsible for the worst slump since the 1930s escaping pretty much scot free. London and the rest of the UK have become two countries, which explains why hostility to the EU increases with distance from the capital. Nor is this phenomenon confined to the UK. It has become commonplace to bracket growing support for leave in poorer parts of Britain with Donald Trump\u2019s emergence as the Republican candidate in this year\u2019s US presidential election, but populist and anti EU sentiment is on the rise across Europe. The US research company Pew conducted a survey earlier this year to test sentiment towards the EU. In Britain, 48% said they had an unfavourable view of the EU and 44% said they had a favourable view. In France, the anti-EU sentiment was much more pronounced at 61% and 38% in favour, while in Germany there had been an eight-point drop in support for the EU in the past year, leaving those in favour only narrowly ahead at 50% against 48% . The impact of the great recession in Europe has been exacerbated by monetary union, a policy blunder of catastrophic proportions. The euro has been responsible for the slow growth and high unemployment that has angered the French, and the high debts and that have alarmed the Germans. Stir in the unexpectedly large flows of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa, and you have a toxic mix. Last summer, when the Greek debt crisis was at its most intense, Europe\u2019s leaders came up with a plan. The \u201cfive presidents\u2019 report\u201d laid down a step-by-step approach to a United States of Europe, with banking union followed by a common budget and finally political union. Getting even the least controversial part of this agenda \u2013 banking union \u2013 past sceptical European electorates has proved impossible. Yet the alternative approach, breaking up the euro and giving countries more control over their own economic destiny, is seen as not just potentially dangerous but also a betrayal of the idea of ever-closer union. When Britain first sought to join the Common Market in the 1960s it did so for pragmatic, not ideological reasons. There was no great desire to pool sovereignty in pursuit of wider political goals, merely a feeling that Germany, France and the Netherlands were growing faster and had more modern economies. After Britain finally became a member of the European club in 1973, there was admiration for Germany\u2019s control of inflation. In the 1980s, the UK left wing changed sides because it saw Europe as a bulwark against Margaret Thatcher. European solidarity was advocated in the 1990s as the best defence against the forces of global capitalism unleashed by the end of the cold war, which is why many on the left wanted Britain to join the single currency. Times have changed. Even with a welcome pickup in activity in the past year, Europe\u2019s growth performance since the launch of the euro has been pitiful. Talk of protecting workers\u2019 rights is meaningless unless you have a job, and millions of Europe\u2019s citizens do not. The structural adjustment programmes forced on those countries that have required financial bailouts have involved savage attacks on workers\u2019 rights, including collective bargaining. The EU has not taken the fight to multinational capital. Rather, Brussels has become a honeypot for corporate lobbyists demanding deregulation and the transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP). One of the great ironies of the UK\u2019s referendum debate is that Europe, with its austerity programmes and its drift towards neoliberalism, has been moving in a direction that rightwing Conservatives would tend to support. Just as in the UK in the 1980s, unemployment has weakened the power of organised labour and the trend is for more competition and for free markets. There is a modern and progressive argument for leaving the EU, but it has struggled to be heard during this dispiriting campaign. It is that Europe is unable to deliver because it is wedded to backward-looking ideas. Or to adapt the words that David Cameron used on his first outing as Conservative leader to taunt Tony Blair, it was the future once. There is a leftwing case for staying in too. This accepts that the EU is far from perfect and must change, but says the answer is to work for a kinder, gentler, greener and more equal Europe from within. Exit, by contrast, would be the catalyst for a breakup of the EU that would give rise to aggressive nationalism and leave Britain at the mercy of rightwing Conservatives who would have the wherewithal to cause immense damage before there was a chance to get rid of them at an election. Yet, it is stretching a point to argue that the treatment of Greece has much to do with the theories of Maynard Keynes or that TTIP would sit comfortably with Fritz Schumacher\u2019s \u201csmall is beautiful\u201d vision. Europe has been going in an entirely different direction, which is why aggressive nationalism will continue to be a problem even if Britain votes to remain. That\u2019s because Europe\u2019s economic model isn\u2019t working and hasn\u2019t been working for a long time. Bad economics leads to bad politics. Always has, always will.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen, the naughty carmaker caught cheating on its emission tests last year, has a newfound humility. We know this because the company modestly told us so in December when it axed its old corporate slogan \u2013 Das Auto \u2013 because it was pretentious. It now simply uses the line \u201cVolkswagen\u201d under its famous badge. No doubt Volkswagen\u2019s boffins can categorically prove that this small cosmetic switch has consigned all the company\u2019s woes to history, simply by feeding marketing data into one of their clever machines that churns out the answers that the company\u2019s execs want to hear. Unusually, however, the company might have to deal with answers that have not been pre-approved this week, when the disgraced car group holds its annual general meeting. Shareholder groups are recommending votes against the company\u2019s bosses in the wake of the emissions scandal \u2013 with Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), plus rival advisory firm Pirc, both advising their clients to oppose Volkswagen\u2019s management board. It sets things up nicely for an entertaining meeting \u2013 with it appearing likely that there will be a fair amount of dissent, plus a chunk of shareholders voting against the carmaker\u2019s bosses. Still, what will the data show? Bruno\u2019s crystal ball fogged up by Tesco It is now around 18 months since one of the most memorable analyst notes of recent times: the cracking research on Tesco penned by Sanford C Bernstein analyst Bruno \u201cMystic\u201d Monteyne following months of the City beating up the grocer\u2019s shares. In November 2014, Monteyne courageously broke from consensus and wrote that there was little Tesco \u201ccan do wrong in the next two years that isn\u2019t in [the share] price\u201d, a point he reiterated to the Times the following month when he mused: \u201cThe discussion now is whether we\u2019ll merely see Tesco stabilise or whether this is the start of a major recovery\u201d. Sadly for Monteyne, those final thoughts were published on the same day that the supermarket chain unveiled another massive profits warning, and while the shares have since been higher, they are now about 16% cheaper than when Bruno spoke. Which brings us to the grocer reporting on trading this week, and Bruno\u2019s latest Tesco note \u2013 which understandably shies away from giving his views, but instead asks investors for theirs. The conclusion? There is \u201cnot even consensus on whether Tesco is winning or losing\u201d, Bruno says. Genius. Has Gormley opened a new bottle at Majestic? We\u2019ve all been there. The drink is flowing, we think we\u2019re tremendously clever and our jokes are utterly hilarious. Nothing can possibly change \u2013 only, then, it does. The booze stops, the jokes turn out to be at best predictable (and at worst seriously misjudged) and you\u2019ve got a stinking headache. That, essentially, was the story of Majestic Wine as a public company. The wine dealer\u2019s shares soared almost fivefold between 2009 and 2013, only to almost halve over the next 18 months. Steve Lewis, who had been at the firm for 29 years and six as chief executive, stepped down in February last year and the hangover was so big that the group spent \u00a370m buying online rival Naked Wines, in a deal that also acquired it a new chief executive in Rowan Gormley. Gormley, a former sidekick of Sir Richard Branson, looks to have pepped the company up again and will be unveiling full-year results this week. \u201cPrelims on 20 June should demonstrate an encouraging first year under new management,\u201d wrote analysts at Investec, as they gushed about the performance of Naked Wines while predicting improvements in Majestic\u2019s retail operations. The shares are up almost 45% this year. Is the party starting again?",

It now simply uses the line \u201cVolkswagen\u201d under its famous badge.</p> <p>No doubt Volkswagen\u2019s boffins can categorically prove that this small cosmetic switch has consigned all the company\u2019s woes to history, simply by feeding marketing data into one of their clever machines that churns out the answers that the company\u2019s execs want to hear.</p> <p>Unusually, however, the company might have to deal with answers that have not been pre-approved this week, when the disgraced car group holds its annual general meeting.</p> <p>Shareholder groups are recommending votes against the company\u2019s bosses in the wake of the emissions scandal \u2013 with Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), plus rival advisory firm Pirc, both advising their clients to oppose Volkswagen\u2019s management board.</p> <p>It sets things up nicely for an entertaining meeting \u2013 with it appearing likely that there will be a fair amount of dissent, plus a chunk of shareholders voting against the carmaker\u2019s bosses.</p> <p>Still, what will the data show?</p> <h2>Bruno\u2019s crystal ball fogged up by Tesco</h2> <p>It is now around 18 months since one of the most memorable analyst notes of recent times: the cracking research on Tesco penned by Sanford C Bernstein analyst Bruno \u201cMystic\u201d Monteyne following months of the City beating up the grocer\u2019s shares.</p> <p>In November 2014, Monteyne courageously broke from consensus and wrote that there was little Tesco \u201ccan do wrong in the next two years that isn\u2019t in [the share] price\u201d, a point he reiterated to the <em>Times</em> the following month when he mused: \u201cThe discussion now is whether we\u2019ll merely see Tesco stabilise or whether this is the start of a major recovery\u201d.</p> <p>Sadly for Monteyne, those final thoughts were published on the same day that the supermarket chain unveiled another massive profits warning, and while the shares have since been higher, they are now about 16% cheaper than when Bruno spoke.</p> <p>Which brings us to the grocer reporting on trading this week, and Bruno\u2019s latest Tesco note \u2013 which understandably shies away from giving his views, but instead asks investors for theirs. The conclusion? There is \u201cnot even consensus on whether Tesco is winning or losing\u201d, Bruno says. Genius.</p> <h2>Has Gormley opened a new bottle at Majestic?</h2> <p>We\u2019ve all been there. The drink is flowing, we think we\u2019re tremendously clever and our jokes are utterly hilarious. Nothing can possibly change \u2013 only, then, it does. The booze stops, the jokes turn out to be at best predictable (and at worst seriously misjudged) and you\u2019ve got a stinking headache.</p> <p>That, essentially, was the story of Majestic Wine as a public company. The wine dealer\u2019s shares soared almost fivefold between 2009 and 2013, only to almost halve over the next 18 months.</p> <p>Steve Lewis, who had been at the firm for 29 years and six as chief executive, stepped down in February last year and the hangover was so big that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/10/majestic-wine-to-buy-online-retailer-naked-wines-for-70m\" title=\"\">group spent \u00a370m buying online rival Naked Wines</a>, in a deal that also acquired it a new chief executive in Rowan Gormley.</p> <p>Gormley, a former sidekick of Sir Richard Branson, looks to have pepped the company up again and will be unveiling full-year results this week. \u201cPrelims on 20 June should demonstrate an encouraging first year under new management,\u201d wrote analysts at Investec, as they gushed about the performance of Naked Wines while predicting improvements in Majestic\u2019s retail operations.</p> <p>The shares are up almost 45% this year.

      "bodyText": "Had a Martian landed in London last Wednesday, they would have been flabbergasted watching Sir Philip Green clash with MPs over his role in the BHS collapse. Here was the retail chain\u2019s former owner, knighted for services to the industry, arguing about it with MPs. It is worth reading the transcript of the raucous six-hour hearing between the billionaire and the parliamentary committee. Green comes across even worse in print than he did in person. He was evasive, obtuse and arrogant. MPs were left without answers to key topics because Green bullied them off the subjects. \u201cSir, which bit of \u2018don\u2019t remember\u2019 is difficult for you to listen to,\u201d he told Richard Graham at one stage. Although Green started the hearing by apologising to BHS staff, the fact that 11,000 people are set to lose their jobs and part of their pensions appeared lost on him. \u201cI want to try to get back to work after this. I\u2019ve been out of work for four weeks,\u201d he said. Green was visibly frustrated when the discussion moved away from the agenda he was trying to set, or in an \u201cuncomfortable\u201d direction. The tycoon pleaded ignorance over some issues and constantly tried to second-guess the motives behind the questions being asked. Green appeared wary of being caught out by MPs and frequently insisted he did not tell lies. Perhaps his attitude was a result of the fact that \u201clife\u2019s moved on\u201d. Those were the words he used when asked if he would consider buying BHS back. When challenged by Frank Field, who said life had not moved on for the 11,000 losing their jobs, he replied: \u201cWith respect, hopefully, 7,000 or 8,000 people are part-time in the retail business. I am not \u2026 saying it\u2019s acceptable, but I think \u2013 hopefully \u2013 the part-time people will get a job.\u201d Only time will tell whether that is accurate, but it seemed a casual remark to make about people\u2019s livelihoods. Green clearly does care about the BHS situation \u2013 even if it is just because he fears for his knighthood. (Towards the end of the hearing, he gave MPs an unprompted description of his contributions to the Retail Trust charity and the Fashion Retail Academy, a shameless attempt to protect his reputation.) If he had made no commitment to sort out the pension situation, calls to strip him of the honour would have become deafening. As it is, we must wait to see what Green comes up with. Given that BHS collapsed nearly two months ago, and he sold the business a year ago, the lack of detail about his rescue plan suggests it has been rustled up quickly as criticism has mounted. But given Green\u2019s insistence on his truthfulness and that he will not run away from the BHS debacle, he should be given the chance to come up with something. Green\u2019s evidence raised further questions about BHS\u2019s demise and the role of advisers. Despite saying he did not want to shift blame for the collapse and the decision to sell it to Dominic Chappell, he has rightly dragged Chappell\u2019s advisers into the scandal. Olswang and Grant Thornton have made \u00a38m from acting for Chappell\u2019s consortium, RAL, according to Green, and should be forced to explain why they represented a man who has been made bankrupt three times. Green suggested the firms were employed \u201con contingency\u201d, meaning the size of their fees depended on RAL managing to buy BHS. As a result, he is implying, they had little incentive to stop the deal. The BHS saga has shone an unflattering light not just on Green, but also on the way business is run in Britain today. Why pile on the agony? Greece needs its debts written off now Greece finally gets its money this week. After the usual shilly-shallying, Athens will receive its latest \u20ac7.5bn loan tranche and thus be able to keep paying its bills. For once the old lie is true: the cheque really is in the post. But it would be a mistake to think the Greek crisis is over. Youth unemployment is above 50%, the banking system is shot and the chances of the Syriza-led government embarking on meaningful structural reform are slim. The 30% contraction of the economy in the past six years has saddled Greece with a colossal debt problem. The national debt as a share of GDP has risen from 100% in 2007 to 180% and according to the IMF will carry on rising to 250% by 2060. Eurozone finance ministers have agreed to measures designed to smooth Greece\u2019s debt payments over the coming years. They also dangled the possibility that Athens would be given more time to pay its creditors and have the interest rate on its debts reduced. The theory is that this package will gradually reduce Greece\u2019s debt burden provided the country keeps to its side of the bargain \u2013 namely to run budget surpluses, excluding interest payments, of 3.5% of GDP every year. Greece would also have to grow at the levels projected by the IMF, with nominal GDP growth \u2013 before inflation is taken into account \u2013 of 4% a year for the next four years and 3.2% a year thereafter. In reality, there seems little prospect of these forecasts being met. Against a backdrop of the refugee crisis and Britain\u2019s EU referendum, and with elections in Germany looming next year, the Greek problem has been parked for the time being. There will be a short-term reduction in debt payments but the long-term picture has not changed. The fact is that, bit by bit, Greece has turned into a third world country inside the EU. And as a third world country it needs a generous debt write-off, not in 20 years\u2019 time but right now. VW hopes electricity will power it back into pole position It is quite a bright move by VW, one of the world\u2019s top three carmakers, to try to reposition itself as a leader in \u201cgreen\u201d transport with a new 30-strong range of all-electric cars. Traditional car sales at VW have stalled recently, following revelations it had been cheating on diesel emission tests. So it needs a new start, and you cannot cheat on electric vehicle (EV) emissions because there aren\u2019t any. It is also wise for the German auto manufacturer to accelerate into the EV market because volumes are growing fast after a slow start. Around a quarter of all car sales in Norway are now either EV or hybrid models, which combine electric power with conventional fuel. VW says that it hopes that all-electric cars will account for between 20%-25% of its total annual sales within a decade. It will cost billions of euros of new investment: but it could just light up sales again.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Don\u2019t blame the EU for your troubles, blame Tory austerity. This is the message Labour voters should hear from Jeremy Corbyn. It is a message Ed Miliband could have made more forcefully during his term as Labour leader, when the conversation on the doorstep turned to immigration. Instead, he appeared to choke with embarrassment. Corbyn has a higher embarrassment threshold. He could look the immigration question in the eye and not blink. Unfortunately, the Islington North MP considers debating immigration off limits. So, last week, Corbyn tried to persuade voters that the EU is the workers\u2019 friend and a bulwark against a bonfire of employment protections. That\u2019s not an unreasonable position. Yet if immigration is the main source of anger outside the south-east, and if it is driving the Brexit campaign to a possible victory, the subject needs to be tackled head-on. If you think Britain is a great place to live that has been ruined by an alliance with other EU nations, you are mistaken and Labour needs to make that point. Here are five reasons that the former coalition government and the current Tory administration are to blame, and not Brussels. Jobs It is easy to walk around an engineering practice in London, a hospital in Leeds or a leek farm in Lincolnshire and conclude that foreigners are stealing \u201cour\u201d jobs. But, in the main, the roles would be unfilled if they were kept out. The work would probably go abroad. On one level, the fault lies with consumers and employers, large and small. Consumers would buy a foreign leek before one grown here picked by a Brit who was paid more and treated better. Employers are at fault for not training school leavers, older workers and job switchers because it\u2019s cheaper to hire foreigners. Profits are calculated on this basis. Moreover, without cheaper labour there would, in many cases, be no business. So foreigners allow employers to expand the number of jobs. That\u2019s what the figures tell us. Compared to this time last year, there are 461,000 more people in work. People from the rest of the EU grabbed a majority of the jobs, but the substitution effect with UK nationals was only at the margins. Overall, the number in work just keeps going up and the UK now has a record employment rate of 74.2%. Look a little closer and it is clear the government has played a big part by cutting skills and training budgets, laying waste to further education and demanding workers accept precarious employment, whether it be zero-hours contracts or self employment. Vacancies Job vacancies are running at a higher level than we have seen at any time this century. A small dip in recent months still leaves the number at 750,000. Most are for services jobs, as one might expect, with the largest number among retailers and wholesalers. Car repair firms reported a 143,000 shortage. The NHS and social work sector accounted for 119,000 of the total. Finding a mechanic, or hiring a nurse, is as much a problem in Leeds as in London. It\u2019s not just about a lack of skilled jobs being created in the north, but also a mismatch of people to jobs \u2013 not a problem invented in Brussels. Wages Adjusted for inflation, average wages have collapsed since the 2008 crash. Workers absorbed cuts in overtime and basic hours to keep their jobs. Since the recovery got into full swing in 2014, wages have nudged ahead of inflation, but not enough to fill the gap. Part of the reason is the lack of investment by employers who rely on cheap workers. But the UK, like all developed economies, is also suffering from the effects of globalisation, which allows multinationals to invest where subsidies are most generous. Ford has centred much of its European operations in Turkey for that reason. Without investment in skilled jobs there will be no increase in wages, but that is not on the Tory agenda. Housing If the worry is that housing is either poor quality or too costly, for yourself and your children, blame successive governments for failing to support good quality state-sponsored housing. The taxes from migrant workers could be used to fund it, but the current and previous governments have preferred to reduce the top rate of tax and protect pensioners\u2019 benefits. There is no evidence in the last 100 years that shows private builders can meet the nation\u2019s needs. This means housing associations have to find funds to build \u2013 but ministers are denying them access to finance, and councils can\u2019t offer builders land when they are forced to sell to the highest bidder. Health service If the queue at the hospital and GP is a problem, this is the result of austerity measures that cut spending growth from 4% a year in real terms to 1% since 2010. The NHS, coping with an ageing society, was supposed to implement reforms to fill the gap but, to no one\u2019s surprise, this project has so far failed. Worse, in his last budget, George Osborne slashed council spending on health by \u00a3800m. That\u2019s cash used for local mental health services and preventative policies, such as tackling obesity.

      "body": "<p>Don\u2019t blame the EU for your troubles, blame Tory austerity. This is the message Labour voters should hear from Jeremy Corbyn. It is a message Ed Miliband could have made more forcefully during his term as Labour leader, when the conversation on the doorstep turned to immigration. Instead, he appeared to choke with embarrassment.</p> <p>Corbyn has a higher embarrassment threshold. He could look the immigration question in the eye and not blink. Unfortunately, the Islington North MP considers debating immigration off limits.</p> <p>So, last week, Corbyn tried to persuade voters that the EU is the workers\u2019 friend and a bulwark against a bonfire of employment protections. That\u2019s not an unreasonable position. Yet if immigration is the main source of anger outside the south-east, and if it is driving the Brexit campaign to a possible victory, the subject needs to be tackled head-on. If you think Britain is a great place to live that has been ruined by an alliance with other EU nations, you are mistaken and Labour needs to make that point.</p> <p>Here are five reasons that the former coalition government and the current Tory administration are to blame, and not Brussels.</p> <h2><strong>Jobs</strong><br></h2> <p>It is easy to walk around an engineering practice in London, a hospital in Leeds or a leek farm in Lincolnshire and conclude that foreigners are stealing \u201cour\u201d jobs. But, in the main, the roles would be unfilled if they were kept out. The work would probably go abroad.</p> <p>On one level, the fault lies with consumers and employers, large and small. Consumers would buy a foreign leek before one grown here picked by a Brit who was paid more and treated better. Employers are at fault for not training school leavers, older workers and job switchers because it\u2019s cheaper to hire foreigners. Profits are calculated on this basis. Moreover, without cheaper labour there would, in many cases, be no business.</p> <p>So foreigners allow employers to expand the number of jobs. That\u2019s what the figures tell us. Compared to this time last year, there are 461,000 more people in work. People from the rest of the EU grabbed a majority of the jobs, but the substitution effect with UK nationals was only at the margins. Overall, the number in work just keeps going up and the UK now has a record employment rate of 74.2%.</p> <p>Look a little closer and it is clear the government has played a big part by cutting skills and training budgets, laying waste to further education and demanding workers accept precarious employment, whether it be zero-hours contracts or self employment.</p> <h2><strong>Vacancies</strong><br></h2> <p>Job vacancies are running at a higher level than we have seen at any time this century. A small dip in recent months still leaves the number at 750,000. Most are for services jobs, as one might expect, with the largest number among retailers and wholesalers. Car repair firms reported a 143,000 shortage. The NHS and social work sector accounted for 119,000 of the total.</p> <p>Finding a mechanic, or hiring a nurse, is as much a problem in Leeds as in London. It\u2019s not just about a lack of skilled jobs being created in the north, but also a mismatch of people to jobs \u2013 not a problem invented in Brussels.</p> <h2><strong>Wages</strong><br></h2> <p>Adjusted for inflation, average wages have collapsed since the 2008 crash. Workers absorbed cuts in overtime and basic hours to keep their jobs.</p> <p>Since the recovery got into full swing in 2014, wages have nudged ahead of inflation, but not enough to fill the gap. Part of the reason is the lack of investment by employers who rely on cheap workers.</p> <p>But the UK, like all developed economies, is also suffering from the effects of globalisation, which allows multinationals to invest where subsidies are most generous. Ford has centred much of its European operations in Turkey for that reason. Without investment in skilled jobs there will be no increase in wages, but that is not on the Tory agenda.</p> <h2><strong>Housing</strong><br></h2> <p>If the worry is that housing is either poor quality or too costly, for yourself and your children, blame successive governments for failing to support good quality state-sponsored housing.</p> <p>The taxes from migrant workers could be used to fund it, but the current and previous governments have preferred to reduce the top rate of tax and protect pensioners\u2019 benefits.</p> <p>There is no evidence in the last 100 years that shows private builders can meet the nation\u2019s needs. This means housing associations have to find funds to build \u2013 but ministers are denying them access to finance, and councils can\u2019t offer builders land when they are forced to sell to the highest bidder.</p> <h2><strong>Health service</strong><br></h2> <p>If the queue at the hospital and GP is a problem, this is the result of austerity measures that cut spending growth from 4% a year in real terms to 1% since 2010. The NHS, coping with an ageing society, was supposed to implement reforms to fill the gap but, to no one\u2019s surprise, this project has so far failed. Worse, in his last budget, George Osborne slashed council spending on health by \u00a3800m. That\u2019s cash used for local mental health services and preventative policies, such as tackling obesity. He told local authorities to put up council tax by 2% to fill the gap.</p> <p>It\u2019s cuts that lead to queues \u2013 in a race to the bottom that Osborne, despite his rhetoric, thinks is just fine.</p>",
