      "bodyText": "The New York attorney general has sued Barclays, accusing the British bank of misrepresenting the safety of its US-based alternative trading system, or \"dark pool\", to investors. Eric Schneiderman said on Wednesday that contrary to its own assurances the bank had operated its dark pool system to favor high-frequency traders \u2013 firms that use complex computer systems to buy and sell huge volumes of stocks in milliseconds to take advantage of often tiny movements in share prices. \u201cThe facts alleged in our complaint show that Barclays demonstrated a disturbing disregard for its investors in a systematic pattern of fraud and deceit,\u201d Schneiderman said. \u201cBarclays grew its dark pool by telling investors they were diving into safe waters. According to the lawsuit, Barclays\u2019 dark pool was full of predators \u2013 there at Barclays\u2019 invitation.\u201d Schneiderman is currently conducting a sweeping investigation into broker-run trading systems known as dark pools at a time when some experts calculate high-frequency trading accounts for the majority of US stock market trading. Scrutiny of the practice intensified following the March release of best-selling author Michael Lewis' book, Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt, which argues that high-frequency traders have rigged the stock market by taking advantage of systems unavailable to others. Barclays' dark pool, LX, was the second largest alternative trading system in the US for the week of 2 June, according to data from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, trading more than 282m shares during the period. Schneiderman alleges that Barclays made false claims about the extent and type of high-frequency trading in its dark pool. In one example he said the bank removed the name of a high-frequency trading firm, then the fund\u2019s largest participant, from its marketing material. The attorney general claims the bank knew the trader engaged in predatory behavior. In response to the change, Schneiderman said, one employee stated: \u201cI had always liked the idea that we were being transparent, but happy to take liberties if we can all agree.\u201d \u201cBarclays heavily promoted a service called Liquidity Profiling, which Barclays claimed was a \u2018surveillance\u2019 system that tracked every trade in Barclays\u2019 dark pool in order to identify predatory traders, rate them based on the objective characteristics of their trading behavior, and hold them accountable for engaging in predatory practices,\u201d Schneiderman\u2019s office said in a statement. Contrary to those promises, the attorney general alleges that: Barclays has never prohibited any trader from participating in its dark pool, regardless of how predatory its activity was determined to be. Barclays did not regularly update the ratings of high-frequency trading firms monitored by Liquidity Profiling. Barclays \u201coverrode\u201d certain Liquidity Profiling ratings \u2013 including for some of its own internal trading desks that engaged in high-frequency trading \u2013 by assigning safe ratings to traders that were otherwise determined to be toxic. Contrary to Barclays\u2019 claims that it protects clients from aggressive or predatory high-frequency trading in its dark pool, Schneiderman alleges that Barclays operates its dark pool to favor high-frequency traders and has given them systematic advantages over others trading in the pool in order to attract them. Schneiderman said the investigation was aided significantly by a number of former Barclays\u2019 employees. Barclays was not immediately available for comment.",

    "webTitle": "Furious investors attack WPP and RBS over excessive bonuses and pay", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Investors at two FTSE 100 companies have joined the chorus of protests against excessive executive pay, with nearly 30% of shareholders at the advertising group WPP refusing to endorse a plan that allowed founder Sir Martin Sorrell to receive a \u00a330m windfall last year. Meanwhile, the Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Sir Philip Hampton was forced to defend the bank's bonus schemes, admitting: \"Pay in the financial sector, particularly banks, got out of line with other sectors and more importantly the underlying performance of the business. \"Ultimately taxpayers picked up some of the bills for that.\" The rebellion at WPP's annual shareholder meeting suggests that departing chairman Philip Lader has yet to quell a rebellion that began in 2012. In arrangements described by the influential advisory group Pirc as excessive, Sorrell is expected to collect nearly \u00a3100m over the next three years in share awards from long term schemes that were halted in 2012 but have yet to expire. In addition, he will be entitled to earn a maximum of \u00a319.3m a year in 2014 and 2015, under a new scheme introduced last year. Votes cast before the meeting at London's Shard skyscraper showed over 28% of shareholders rejected or abstained from approving the 2013 pay plan, up from 26% the year before. In a separate poll on the three year pay policy introduced in 2013, the first binding vote under new city rules, 26% voted against or abstained. However, in order to pass a resolution, companies need a simple majority of votes cast, and WPP secured approval from nearly 82% of shareholders excluding abstentions for its pay policy. \"There have been some considerable concessions about executive remuneration at WPP over the last few years but the company still maintains a complex assortment of pay arrangements,\" said Pirc representative Andrew Whiley at the meeting. \"Will the board consider making all of the variable pay arrangements much more simple, transparent, and easier for shareholders to get a handle on?\" Because WPP has not cancelled legacy pay schemes, which will make up the bulk of Sorrell's earnings over the coming years, Pirc argues the company is running six separate plans, all of which have different rules. Awards under WPP's contentious leadership equity acquisition plan (Leap) will continue until 2016. This is because the scheme ran until 2012, but executives are not able to claim their shares for five years. By 2016, Sorrell is expected to receive 7.8m shares from Leap, worth \u00a397.5m at Wednesday's \u00a312.52 share price. Lader responded: \"We admit complexity but hope you see our commitment to transparency,\" adding that cancelling earlier plans would be unfair and could raise legal issues. Private shareholder Keith Jago took the floor at the meeting to say Sorrell's \u00a330m earnings last year were equivalent to \u00a324,000 for every working hour. He also questioned the chief executive's benefits, which included a \u00a3167,000 travel allowance for his wife Cristiana Sorrell, an organiser of the World Economic Forum at Davos. \"I wonder how anyone can be wroth \u00a330m when the UK is debating over minimum wage levels,\" said Jago. He also questioned the company's tax haven registration in Jersey. \"Personally I don't want to be part of a company that behaves like that. Are we of the same ilk as Amazon or Starbucks?\" WPP paid \u00a3240m around the world in corporation tax last year, according to finance director Paul Richardson, and over \u00a3150m in the UK in various taxes. Following the collapse of a merger between American rival Omnicom and France's Publicis, WPP remains by some margin the largest marketing group in the world, accounting for at least a quarter of global media spend. Sorrell pointed out that \u00a31,000 invested when the company was founded in 1985 would be wroth \u00a347,900 today. The same sum invested in the FTSE 250 over that period would be worth just \u00a34,250. He said WPP had enriched institutional investors and pension funds by \u00a318bn during its lifetime as a listed company. Scottish Widows, the third largest shareholder with 2.5% and a leading voice in previous revolts, is understood to have backed the board this year. Blackrock, the second-largest investor with 3.5%, and Legal &amp; General are understood to have supported the pay policy. The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, which represents 60 public sector retirement funds, advised its members to vote against. The forum's chair Kieran Quinn said: \"Overall, it is excessive and does not have our support \u2026 The Forum will continue to highlight examples of where senior leadership of large corporations seek complex salary and bonus packages that are not justified by performance and are out of step with shareholder and community expectations of reasonable reward for effort.\" At RBS's annual meeting at its Gogarburn headquarters on the outskirts of Edinburgh, all resolutions were overwhelmingly passed after the UK government voted its 63% stake in favour of the necessary resolutions. The Treasury had previously forced the state-owned bank to scrap plans to pay its bankers bonuses twice the size of their salaries, but nodded through plans to hand executives payouts of up to 100% of basic salary. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan is in line for \u00a31m a year in \"share allowances\". This prompted private shareholder Elaine McMillan to ask during the meeting: \"How do we get out of the spiral of all banks paying obscenely large bonuses and extremely large salaries?\" Sir Philip replied that RBS, which made an \u00a38.2bn loss last year, \"had done more than most\". He said overall bonuses had come down by 60% in the last four years, and by 75% in investment banking alone. \"I don't think it's 'job done' yet, but huge progress has been made.\" He also insisted: \"We have to have competitive pay structures.\" Hampton warned of further branch closures as the popularity of online and mobile banking grows. But he insisted that RBS, which has about 1,600 branches at present, would keep \"a very large branch network across the UK\" and have more branches than supermarket chains Asda and Sainsbury's combined (1,500). He later qualified his remarks, saying there is no floor. As in previous years, and somewhat surprisingly, RBS bosses were not asked any questions on Scottish independence, even though the referendum is less than three months away. In his opening remarks, Hampton refused to take sides but said RBS was considering the potential business implications of a Yes vote. He flagged up risks relating to the bank's credit rating, tax and regulation, but noted that it would take up to two years before Scotland actually became independent. During this transition period, the UK would remain the sovereign domicile for RBS. Investors backed the removal of the dividend access share, which gives the government priority over payouts. It will cost the bank about \u00a31.5bn to buy itself out of the scheme. Hampton also fielded questions from shareholders over the bank's lending to the coal industry, which Friends of the Earth Scotland said had increased since 2005, despite the bank's claims to the contrary. FoE Scotland says RBS is the third-biggest global investor in coal. Hampton said it's \"not a major part of our portfolio.\"",

He also questioned the chief executive's benefits, which included a \u00a3167,000 travel allowance for his wife Cristiana Sorrell, an organiser of the World Economic Forum at Davos.</p> <p>\"I wonder how anyone can be wroth \u00a330m when the UK is debating over minimum wage levels,\" said Jago. He also questioned the company's tax haven registration in Jersey. \"Personally I don't want to be part of a company that behaves like that. Are we of the same ilk as Amazon or Starbucks?\"</p> <p>WPP paid \u00a3240m around the world in corporation tax last year, according to finance director Paul Richardson, and over \u00a3150m in the UK in various taxes. Following the collapse of a merger between American rival Omnicom and France's Publicis, WPP remains by some margin the largest marketing group in the world, accounting for at least a quarter of global media spend.</p> <p>Sorrell pointed out that \u00a31,000 invested when the company was founded in 1985 would be wroth \u00a347,900 today. The same sum invested in the FTSE 250 over that period would be worth just \u00a34,250. He said WPP had enriched institutional investors and pension funds by \u00a318bn during its lifetime as a listed company.</p> <p>Scottish Widows, the third largest shareholder with 2.5% and a leading voice in previous revolts, is understood to have backed the board this year. Blackrock, the second-largest investor with 3.5%, and Legal &amp; General are understood to have supported the pay policy.</p> <p>The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, which represents 60 public sector retirement funds, advised its members to vote against. The forum's chair Kieran Quinn said: \"Overall, it is excessive and does not have our support \u2026 The Forum will continue to highlight examples of where senior leadership of large corporations seek complex salary and bonus packages that are not justified by performance and are out of step with shareholder and community expectations of reasonable reward for effort.\"</p> <p>At RBS's annual meeting at its Gogarburn headquarters on the outskirts of Edinburgh, all resolutions were overwhelmingly passed after the UK government voted its 63% stake in favour of the necessary resolutions. The Treasury had previously forced the state-owned bank to scrap plans to pay its bankers bonuses twice the size of their salaries, but nodded through plans to hand executives payouts of up to 100% of basic salary. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan is in line for \u00a31m a year in \"share allowances\".</p> <p>This prompted private shareholder Elaine McMillan to ask during the meeting: \"How do we get out of the spiral of all banks paying obscenely large bonuses and extremely large salaries?\"</p> <p>Sir Philip replied that RBS, which made an \u00a38.2bn loss last year, \"had done more than most\". He said overall bonuses had come down by 60% in the last four years, and by 75% in investment banking alone. \"I don't think it's 'job done' yet, but huge progress has been made.\" He also insisted: \"We have to have competitive pay structures.\"</p> <p>Hampton warned of further branch closures as the popularity of online and mobile banking grows. But he insisted that RBS, which has about 1,600 branches at present, would keep \"a very large branch network across the UK\" and have more branches than supermarket chains Asda and Sainsbury's combined (1,500). He later qualified his remarks, saying there is no floor.</p> <p>As in previous years, and somewhat surprisingly, RBS bosses were not asked any questions on Scottish independence, even though the referendum is less than three months away. In his opening remarks, Hampton refused to take sides but said RBS was considering the potential business implications of a Yes vote. He flagged up risks relating to the bank's credit rating, tax and regulation, but noted that it would take up to two years before Scotland actually became independent. During this transition period, the UK would remain the sovereign domicile for RBS.</p> <p>Investors backed the removal of the dividend access share, which gives the government priority over payouts. It will cost the bank about \u00a31.5bn to buy itself out of the scheme.</p> <p>Hampton also fielded questions from shareholders over the bank's lending to the coal industry, which Friends of the Earth Scotland said had increased since 2005, despite the bank's claims to the contrary. FoE Scotland says RBS is the third-biggest global investor in coal. Hampton said it's \"not a major part of our portfolio.\"</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government is weighing into the battle for compensation for victims of last year's Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh with a letter warning British retailers including Matalan to pay up. The cut-price clothing chain, based in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, has admitted that its clothes had been produced on the second floor of the factory building, where over 1,100 people died, but has refused to pay into a compensation fund backed by the International Labour Organisation. The company says it was not using Rana Plaza when the building collapsed and has insisted that it has already helped victims with a donation to a charity support programme to mothers involved in the disaster. Alan Duncan, the international development minister, said he is writing personally to a number of retailers, understood to include Matalan, as he was alarmed that a number had not made any contribution to the ILO fund. Workers' rights campaigners say the type of charity scheme Matalan has paid into does not provide full compensation for loss of earnings by injured workers and the families of those who died. They want Matalan to pay \u00a33m into the ILO fund that remains less than halfway to its $40m (\u00a324m) target more than a year after the disaster. Although Duncan refused to name the companies he has written to, his action marks the first time a government minister has put pressure on individual retailers over payments into the compensation fund. It comes after Frances O'Grady, the TUC general secretary, called on the government to pressure UK companies sourcing from Bangladesh to pay up. To date, $17.1m has been donated or pledged to the compensation fund. Victims have received a first tranche of cash, but there are fears that additional payments will be cut short if further donations by retailers are not forthcoming. \"We have to raise the pressure over a year after the event to make sure a complete compensation package is assembled,\" Duncan said. He added that retailers could not claim that they weren't aware of where their clothes were produced because production had been sub-contracted by their suppliers. Duncan's intervention comes after Jenny Willott, the consumer affairs minister, said retailers must have a policy on sourcing ethical products, because ignoring consumers' concerns about forced labour and dangerous working conditions could risk putting them out of business. In the wake of a Guardian investigation which found prawns sold in the UK were produced with the help of slave labour, she ordered the British Retail Consortium to produce new guidance urging its members to improve transparency about human rights abuses linked to food, drink, clothing and other products. Duncan's intervention also comes ahead of a high-level international meeting in Paris at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that will discuss global efforts to build more responsible supply chains in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster.",

      "standfirst": "After her former employer admits negligence, cancer patient Janice Allen explains how her perception of the firm is destroyed", 
      "body": "<p>Janice Allen sits in the conservatory in her cosy semi-detached house in Harrow, husband Stuart alongside her, explaining how their lives have been devastated after she was diagnosed with the deadly cancer mesothelioma, caused by being exposed to asbestos when she worked at Marks &amp; Spencer up to 36 years ago.</p> <p>Her lawyer, Harminder Bains of Leigh Day, who took on the legal claim in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/25/marks-and-spencer-employee-asbestos-cancer\" title=\"\">M&amp;S have admitted breaching their duty of care to Allen</a>, is warning that many more hard-working, as yet oblivious members of the public could comprise a \"third phase\" of people stricken by exposure to asbestos. Bains says that inadequate safety procedures, in breach of the strict law on asbestos-handing and removal, means the public must have been exposed. First of all, industrial and construction workers handled asbestos when it was considered an invaluable fire-proof material until its dangers were recognised in the 1970s, before maintenance workers were exposed in those buildings.</p> <p>\"Before this happened,\" Allen says, \"I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos. I never would have dreamed that I would be affected by it. It has been devastating.\"</p> <p>She and Stuart met when they both worked at M&amp;S; he was 18, she 19, his supervisor on the men's shirts section of the flagship Oxford Street store in London near Marble Arch. They recall working hard, being made to feel part of an M&amp;S family, that the company cared. Thursdays were late-night shopping and pay day, and they would often go to the pub, the Marlborough Head, after work. Janice, now 53, worked for nine years, 1988-87, at Marble Arch then M&amp;S in Uxbridge until they had their first child, Matthew, now 26, then their daughter, Louise, now 24. Stuart stayed at M&amp;S for 22 years, working his way up to becoming a business analyst, until he left in 2001.</p> <p>\"Marks &amp; Spencer engender this complete loyalty; they had welfare for staff, hairdressing, when they celebrated 100 years as a company [in 1984] we were all given books on the history,\" Janice says. \"Now I feel so angry and betrayed. To know that behind the scenes it is so cynical they did not even care for the health and safety of their own employees \u2013 it is beyond words. I was only 18 when I joined, I thought I had a secure job, and now every day I wish I could turn the clock back and had never, ever gone to work for them.\"</p> <p>After the children went to school, Janice herself worked in schools, latterly as a higher level teaching assistant for secondary school children with special educational needs, a job she loved. She and Stuart were looking forward to a little more comfort, and holidays, in the forthcoming years, but the end of their plans came after Janice woke up one morning in the summer of 2012 with agonising pain in her ribs. It was, she says, \"like a shard of glass going through my muscle\".</p> <p>The pain eased for several months, until in March 2013 the agony returned. She went through a series of tests and X-rays, until in April 2013 she was diagnosed with mesothelioma. It is a cancer in the outer lining of the lung, caused from cells forming around asbestos, possibly just a single deadly fibre, which can have been inhaled decades before.</p> <p>\"It has been devastating, the shock of the diagnosis,\" Janice says. \"It was disbelief, at how this could happen, and to realise it is not curable, although it is treatable \u2013 I am having to hang on to that. My first reactions were to go completely into depression and extreme anxiety. Without the help of Macmillan nurses and the hospital, I would be having terrible trouble functioning normally now.\"</p> <p>She did not think for some time about suing M&amp;S, but through her stepmother, she heard about Marks &amp; Spencer having been prosecuted, for illegally unsafe handling of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/26/marks-and-spencer-asbestos-fine\" title=\"\">asbestos at the Reading store</a>, for which the firm was fined \u00a31m in 2011, and sued by former employees, in cases which settled rather than reached a judgment.</p> <p>Bains, an asbestos specialist, applied for a court order that M&amp;S disclose documents relating to the Marble Arch and Uxbridge stores where Janice Allen worked, including surveys of the stores which would show the prevalence of asbestos. M&amp;S did not disclose the documents. But in April M&amp;S formally admitted in court that it: \"In breach of duty, exposed [Janice Allen] to asbestos fibres, during the course of her employment with them.\" The company declined to comment on its breach of duty to Allen, but stressed it took place in the 1970s and 80s.</p> <p>In a statement the company said: \"We are confident that we now have the most rigorous policy we can have in place and that M&amp;S stores are safe for our employees and our customers.\"</p> <p>That admission does raise the alarming possibility that in the past, many other people, in places as public as M&amp;S's large stores, may have contracted the deadly disease previously associated with unfortunate industrial and maintenance workers.</p> <p>\"I hope my case will bring some attention on to this,\" Allen says. \"When we understood how much asbestos there was, the degree of risk we were exposed to, we felt so angry.

Her lawyer, Harminder Bains of Leigh Day, who took on the legal claim in which M&amp;S have admitted breaching their duty of care to Allen, is warning that many more hard-working, as yet oblivious members of the public could comprise a \"third phase\" of people stricken by exposure to asbestos. Bains says that inadequate safety procedures, in breach of the strict law on asbestos-handing and removal, means the public must have been exposed. First of all, industrial and construction workers handled asbestos when it was considered an invaluable fire-proof material until its dangers were recognised in the 1970s, before maintenance workers were exposed in those buildings. \"Before this happened,\" Allen says, \"I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos. I never would have dreamed that I would be affected by it. It has been devastating.\" She and Stuart met when they both worked at M&amp;S; he was 18, she 19, his supervisor on the men's shirts section of the flagship Oxford Street store in London near Marble Arch. They recall working hard, being made to feel part of an M&amp;S family, that the company cared. Thursdays were late-night shopping and pay day, and they would often go to the pub, the Marlborough Head, after work. Janice, now 53, worked for nine years, 1988-87, at Marble Arch then M&amp;S in Uxbridge until they had their first child, Matthew, now 26, then their daughter, Louise, now 24. Stuart stayed at M&amp;S for 22 years, working his way up to becoming a business analyst, until he left in 2001. \"Marks &amp; Spencer engender this complete loyalty; they had welfare for staff, hairdressing, when they celebrated 100 years as a company [in 1984] we were all given books on the history,\" Janice says. \"Now I feel so angry and betrayed. To know that behind the scenes it is so cynical they did not even care for the health and safety of their own employees \u2013 it is beyond words. I was only 18 when I joined, I thought I had a secure job, and now every day I wish I could turn the clock back and had never, ever gone to work for them.\" After the children went to school, Janice herself worked in schools, latterly as a higher level teaching assistant for secondary school children with special educational needs, a job she loved. She and Stuart were looking forward to a little more comfort, and holidays, in the forthcoming years, but the end of their plans came after Janice woke up one morning in the summer of 2012 with agonising pain in her ribs. It was, she says, \"like a shard of glass going through my muscle\". The pain eased for several months, until in March 2013 the agony returned. She went through a series of tests and X-rays, until in April 2013 she was diagnosed with mesothelioma. It is a cancer in the outer lining of the lung, caused from cells forming around asbestos, possibly just a single deadly fibre, which can have been inhaled decades before. \"It has been devastating, the shock of the diagnosis,\" Janice says. \"It was disbelief, at how this could happen, and to realise it is not curable, although it is treatable \u2013 I am having to hang on to that. My first reactions were to go completely into depression and extreme anxiety. Without the help of Macmillan nurses and the hospital, I would be having terrible trouble functioning normally now.\" She did not think for some time about suing M&amp;S, but through her stepmother, she heard about Marks &amp; Spencer having been prosecuted, for illegally unsafe handling of asbestos at the Reading store, for which the firm was fined \u00a31m in 2011, and sued by former employees, in cases which settled rather than reached a judgment. Bains, an asbestos specialist, applied for a court order that M&amp;S disclose documents relating to the Marble Arch and Uxbridge stores where Janice Allen worked, including surveys of the stores which would show the prevalence of asbestos. M&amp;S did not disclose the documents. But in April M&amp;S formally admitted in court that it: \"In breach of duty, exposed [Janice Allen] to asbestos fibres, during the course of her employment with them.\" The company declined to comment on its breach of duty to Allen, but stressed it took place in the 1970s and 80s. In a statement the company said: \"We are confident that we now have the most rigorous policy we can have in place and that M&amp;S stores are safe for our employees and our customers.\" That admission does raise the alarming possibility that in the past, many other people, in places as public as M&amp;S's large stores, may have contracted the deadly disease previously associated with unfortunate industrial and maintenance workers. \"I hope my case will bring some attention on to this,\" Allen says. \"When we understood how much asbestos there was, the degree of risk we were exposed to, we felt so angry. Throughout our time, nobody ever said anything about it.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "WPP will probably regard a 28% rebellion over its pay report, including abstentions, as a half-decent result. There were a few more rebels than last year but a lot fewer than in 2012, when 60% refused to support the pay report and the advertising house was obliged to call a halt to Sir Martin Sorrell's super-charged co-investment scheme. WPP's attitude will be: a majority is a majority, what's the fuss? It is, of course, possible for a company's pay committee to operate this way and to congratulate itself on how its judgments have been \"corroborated by the support of a significant majority of share owners,\" as the current annual report described last year's outcome. Yet the members of the committee, and chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell, should ask themselves why WPP, even after \"substantial revisions\" to its pay policies, finds itself roughly as popular as Barclays on remuneration. The level of the protest at the bank was 34% this year, even after the decision to pay bigger bonuses to investment bankers in a year of sharply lower profits. WPP, with its vastly better financial performance and share price, only just did better. The explanation is twofold. First, Sorrell's reformed pay arrangements are still vastly over-the-top by the standards of FTSE 100 companies of similar size. The boss will get \u00a37.8m for \"on plan\" performance this year and can collect almost \u00a320m as a maximum reward. Carrots of that size only exist these days at firms that have decided to adopt a tin ear to the public debate over boardroom pay. The second explanation is that Sorrell gets the chance to earn such rewards while sitting on a mountain of payouts that are yet to vest under his \"Leap\" \u2013 leadership equity acquisition plan \u2013 co-investment scheme. When WPP was bounced by the 2012 rebels into stopping new grants under Leap, the company said it would honour all past awards. The relevant table in the annual report shows what Leap, which ran in five-year cycles, could be worth to Sorrell in the next three years. We're talking up to 7.8m shares, worth \u00a396m at current share prices. He is not lacking reasons to be motivated. There's one more cheery fact: a \u00a3167,000 allowance for \"spousal travel,\" a real novelty. In the circumstances, it's amazing that these things seem to annoy only one in four WPP shareholders.",

      "body": "<p>WPP will probably regard a 28% rebellion over its pay report, including abstentions, as a half-decent result. There were a few more rebels than last year but a lot fewer than in 2012, when 60% refused to support the pay report and the advertising house was obliged to call a halt to Sir Martin Sorrell's super-charged co-investment scheme. WPP's attitude will be: a majority is a majority, what's the fuss?</p> <p>It is, of course, possible for a company's pay committee to operate this way and to congratulate itself on how its judgments have been \"corroborated by the support of a significant majority of share owners,\" as the current annual report described last year's outcome.</p> <p>Yet the members of the committee, and chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell, should ask themselves why WPP, even after \"substantial revisions\" to its pay policies, finds itself roughly as popular as Barclays on remuneration. The level of the protest at the bank was 34% this year, even after the decision to pay bigger bonuses to investment bankers in a year of sharply lower profits. WPP, with its vastly better financial performance and share price, only just did better.</p> <p>The explanation is twofold. First, Sorrell's reformed pay arrangements are still vastly over-the-top by the standards of FTSE 100 companies of similar size. The boss will get \u00a37.8m for \"on plan\" performance this year and can collect almost \u00a320m as a maximum reward. Carrots of that size only exist these days at firms that have decided to adopt a tin ear to the public debate over boardroom pay.</p> <p>The second explanation is that Sorrell gets the chance to earn such rewards while sitting on a mountain of payouts that are yet to vest under his \"Leap\" \u2013 leadership equity acquisition plan \u2013 co-investment scheme. When WPP was bounced by the 2012 rebels into stopping new grants under Leap, the company said it would honour all past awards.</p> <p>The relevant table in the annual report shows what Leap, which ran in five-year cycles, could be worth to Sorrell in the next three years. We're talking up to 7.8m shares, worth \u00a396m at current share prices. He is not lacking reasons to be motivated.</p> <p>There's one more cheery fact: a \u00a3167,000 allowance for \"spousal travel,\" a real novelty.</p> <p>In the circumstances, it's amazing that these things seem to annoy only one in four WPP shareholders.</p>",

She thinks the economy's unexpectedly large contraction lies behind the steady-does-it stance of Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US economy didn\u2019t just grind to a halt in the first quarter - it hit reverse as the polar vortex took its toll. But we can\u2019t judge current growth by looking in the rear-view mirror, and we are unlikely to see investors react strongly to what is now quite a long way behind us. More recent data have pointed to the economy picking up speed. Manufacturing is at a four year high, while the housing market is looking positive once more. It\u2019s clear that growth has gone up through the gears in Q2, and we\u2019ll see this reflected in the next GDP reading. </p> <p>While the blip shouldn\u2019t be taken as an indication of underlying weakness in the economy, it has impacted monetary policy. Given the sheer scale of the weather-related slowdown, Yellen hasn\u2019t really had the option to change policy in recent months. In the context, any move away either away from tapering or towards tightening would have rung alarm bells for investors, and this won\u2019t change until data has been consistently on trend. We expect ongoing further forward guidance to prevent the eventual normalisation of interest rates from being a bombshell to investors, but a change in policy isn\u2019t likely in the short-term.\u201d <br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53aac865e4b061988273a138\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-25T13:05:40.575Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Royal Bank of Scotland</b>'s annual meeting has just started at the bank's giant Gogarburn HQ.</p> <p>My colleage Julia Kollewe is in Edinburgh and has filed this brief update on RBS and Scottish independence.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At Royal Bank of Scotland's annual meeting, bosses are likely to be quizzed about executive pay and Scottish independence. <br></p> <p>Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman, said the bank continued to maintain a \"neutral position\" on independence.

The UK government has indicated that it would take 18 months before Scotland became independent. <br>Hampton said: \"During this transition period, the Bank of England would be lender of last resort to the banking sector and the UK would be the sovereign domicile for RBS.\"<br> <br>There are fears for RBS's 3,000 jobs at its Gogarburn headquarters on the outskirts of Edinburgh, if the bank had to move to London.

It said it supported the re-election of directors and on bonuses it said: Following a process of thorough engagement with the RBS remuneration committee, UKFI believes the committee has exercised reasonable judgement in relation to their approach to directors\u2019 remuneration, particularly in the context of the challenging year RBS experienced in 2013 and the new strategy as outlined by Ross McEwan earlier this year. RBS continues to make use of share-based variable awards and applies stringent deferral conditions, which protect the interests of shareholders. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. The European Banking Authority - the pan regulator for the EU - has just published its outlook for the sector, 24 hours before the Bank of England puts out its assessment of the risks facing the financial system, writes Jill Treanor. The EBA's verdict can be found here. The verdict? Improvements to the strength of the banking industry have taken place but there is plenty to be worried about: \u2022 the future profitability of banks: In 2013, the total operating income declined by \u20ac10bn (after a decline of \u20ac39bn in 2012) and, in the last quarter of 2013, the annual flow of profits declined by 58 % (\u20ac54bn) \u2022 looming redress costs for past mistakes \u2022 a need to keep shrinking balance sheets to bolster capital ratios after a \u20ac3.4tn reduction since 2011 The EBA concludes that the business models of some banks will find it difficult to survive in the current environment, especially as many of the banks in its sample were providing their shareholders with a return on equity of less than 4%. Shareholders in banks were used to double digit returns on this measure before the crisis. More from the RBS meeting, courtesy Julia Kollewe: At the RBS AGM, Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman, says branch transactions have fallen 30% since 2011 and more closures are on the way. We still see a major role for branches as places where our customers can interact with our staff on the big life decisions such as taking out a mortgage, starting up their own business, generally planning for their futures and getting on top of their finances. We know the value of the High Street branch, and RBS will retain a very large branch network across the UK to fulfil that vision. Since 2011, we've invested \u00a3130m in refurbishing 680 branches, \u00a370m in the last 12 months alone. We will continue to have more branches than Asda and Sainsbury's stores combined. But with continued rapid change in the way people choose to bank, there will inevitably be further closures. Where we have to make the difficult decision to close a branch we will tell our staff and customers first and set out what the alternatives are, such as the post office network or mobile vans. Things don't seem that explosive in the hall so far. Julia Kollewe's progress reports come via Twitter: Here are some comments on the US GDP figures from Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. She thinks the economy's unexpectedly large contraction lies behind the steady-does-it stance of Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve: The US economy didn\u2019t just grind to a halt in the first quarter - it hit reverse as the polar vortex took its toll. But we can\u2019t judge current growth by looking in the rear-view mirror, and we are unlikely to see investors react strongly to what is now quite a long way behind us. More recent data have pointed to the economy picking up speed. Manufacturing is at a four year high, while the housing market is looking positive once more. It\u2019s clear that growth has gone up through the gears in Q2, and we\u2019ll see this reflected in the next GDP reading. While the blip shouldn\u2019t be taken as an indication of underlying weakness in the economy, it has impacted monetary policy. Given the sheer scale of the weather-related slowdown, Yellen hasn\u2019t really had the option to change policy in recent months. In the context, any move away either away from tapering or towards tightening would have rung alarm bells for investors, and this won\u2019t change until data has been consistently on trend. We expect ongoing further forward guidance to prevent the eventual normalisation of interest rates from being a bombshell to investors, but a change in policy isn\u2019t likely in the short-term.\u201d Royal Bank of Scotland's annual meeting has just started at the bank's giant Gogarburn HQ. My colleage Julia Kollewe is in Edinburgh and has filed this brief update on RBS and Scottish independence. At Royal Bank of Scotland's annual meeting, bosses are likely to be quizzed about executive pay and Scottish independence. Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman, said the bank continued to maintain a \"neutral position\" on independence. Scottish voters will decide on Scotland's future on 18 September. He added: \"There is a great deal of uncertainty and we have raised a number of issues in our full year risk disclosures which I am not going to repeat here in detail but cover areas such as our credit rating, tax and regulation.\" Hampton said there is no reason to panic even if there is a Yes vote because \"there would be a period of time between the referendum and Scotland actually becoming independent when the UK and Scottish governments would enter negotiations\". The UK government has indicated that it would take 18 months before Scotland became independent. Hampton said: \"During this transition period, the Bank of England would be lender of last resort to the banking sector and the UK would be the sovereign domicile for RBS.\" There are fears for RBS's 3,000 jobs at its Gogarburn headquarters on the outskirts of Edinburgh, if the bank had to move to London. Under EU rules, banks must be based in the same country as most of their business. In the case of RBS, this is England. RBS employs about 12,000 people in Scotland, out of 70,000 in the UK. US GDP contracted by an annual rate of 2.9% in the first quarter, official and final figures show. April's first estimate was for shrinkage of 0.1%, making this the biggest downward revision ever, according to Reuters. Economists had expected today's figure to come in at minus 1.7%. Here's part of Reuters' story: While the economy's woes have been largely blamed on an unusually cold winter, the magnitude of the revisions suggest other factors at play beyond the weather. Sharp revisions to GDP numbers are not unusual as the government does not have complete data when it makes its initial and preliminary estimates. The latest revisions reflect a weaker pace of healthcare spending than previously assumed, which caused a downgrading of the consumer spending estimate. Trade was also a bigger drag on the economy than previously thought. Data such as employment, manufacturing and services sectors point to a sharp acceleration in growth early in the second quarter. However, the pace of expansion could fall short of expectations, which range as high as a 3.6 percent rate. Economists estimate severe weather could have slashed as much as 1.5 percentage points from GDP growth in the first quarter. The government, however, gave no details on the impact of the weather. Here's are some tweets in response: Shareholders at the WPP AGM are asking questions about Sir Martin Sorrell's pay after a sizable rebellion against the company's remuneration report and policy: In case anyone's forgotten, the Church of England holds an indirect stake in Wonga, the payday lender revealed today to have masqueraded as bogus law firms to put pressure on late payers. The church still hold the stake even though Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has pledged to put payday lenders out of business by supporting credit unions. Jill Treanor has written a pithy blog post about the stake, which you can read here. Juliette Garside has tweeted a picture from WPP's AGM to keep us amused: Talk to fund managers and the message is that appetite for flotations is waning after the fervour of the first few months of the year gave way to greater scepticism about the claims of companies and their owners coming to market. But figures from Dealogic, courtesy of my colleague Jill Treanor, show that the second quarter of the year, which isn't quite over, was a record. Here are the details: \u00b7 UK IPO volume in 2Q 2014 so far stands at $13.9bn via 37 deals, the highest quarterly total on record. Volume is up 97% from 1Q 2014 ($7bn via 20 deals), and has surpassed the previous quarterly record of $9.0bn (50 deals) set in 4Q 2006 \u00b7 AA plc\u2019s IPO on June 23rd is the largest UK ECM deal to price so far this quarter, raising $2.4bn via Cenkos Securities plc. This is the largest UK Auto/Truck ECM deal on record, and the largest EMEA Auto/Truck IPO deal since Tognum AG\u2019s $2.7bn listing in June 2007 via Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs \u00b7 Finance issuers lead UK IPO volume in 2Q 2014 so far with a 21% market share ($2.9bn via nine deals), the highest quarterly volume for the sector since 4Q 2006 ($5.0bn via 19 deals). Retail follows with an 18.5% market share ($2.6bn via four deals), the second largest quarterly total on record for the sector behind $3.1bn via six deals in 1Q 2014 o Pricing on May 23rd, Saga plc\u2019s $928m IPO via Citigroup, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and UBS is the eighth largest UK Finance IPO on record \u00b7 Cenkos Securities plc leads the UK IPO bookrunner ranking in 2014 YTD with a 12.5% market share, followed by JPMorgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch with 9.8% and 8.2%, respectively AbbVie, the US drugmaker that is trying to buy London-listed Shire, has set out its case for the proposed \u00a327bn deal. AbbVie said its cash-and-shares offer represented \"compelling\" immediate value with significant future potential for gains from ownership in the enlarged group. It said the transaction, which includes rebasing AbbVie in the UK for tax purposes, was \"highly executable\". Shire has said there are risks attached to the so-called tax inversion ploy, which would help AbbVie avoid tax in the US. The proposed combination is strategically compelling to AbbVie and Shire and would create a larger and more diversified biopharmaceutical company with multiple leading franchises and significant financial capacity for future acquisitions, investment and enhanced shareholder distributions and value creation. The US company also sought to persuade Shire shareholders that the part of the proposed deal paid in AbbVie shares was a good deal. AstraZeneca of the UK was able to fend off a takeover approach from Pfizer partly because it convinced shareholders that Pfizer had few growth prospects on its own. AbbVie stock has meaningful upside independent of a transaction - AbbVie believes that irrespective of a combination with Shire, its stock has potential for meaningful appreciation, driven by strong fundamental performance, a robust pipeline, top-tier EPS growth and strong cash flows. More on the WPP result from our Juliette Garside here: The shareholder revolt at WPP's AGM has come in as expected. Nearly 30% of votes failed to back both the remuneration report and the future pay policy. Let's hope there are some good questions on the subject. WPP's annual meeting has kicked off at the Shard in London and the advertising company has published opening remarks by Phil Lader, its chairman. On a comparable basis, revenues were up 7.6% in the first five months of the year. This year is expected to be another strong one after a record 2014, he said. There's no reference to the pay of Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive, which is expected to trigger a shareholder rebellion when the votes are counted. Instead, Lader is fed up that his employees don't get the credit they deserve: I believe there are still businesses that still see creativity as little more than a cosmetic: a final touch of lipstick to make a product look more appealing. They are profoundly wrong: and the world is full of case studies to prove them wrong. Applied creativity can be as central, as integral and as functional as any operating system; and should be expected to be so. And secondly - and this is where my exasperation shows itself: to misrepresent commercial creativity as just a bit of fancy window-dressing is hugely to underrate the talents of those who create it. To make entrancing things within the unforgiving discipline of a marketing brief is a very, very difficult thing to do; and all the more so, since it's often made to look so easy. My colleague Juliette Garside is at the Shard and will report any major developments. The latest company to announce a flotation in the crowded market for initial public offerings (IPOs) is Spire, the private hospital group. The company, owned by Cinven, the private equity firm, wants to raise \u00a3315m to reduce its debt and fund expansion. It is aiming for a stock market valuation of about \u00a31bn, Reuters reported. The company will publish its prospectus on 7 July and squeeze its float in later next month before the City heads for the beach in August. The UK is heading for a record year for IPOs after the market spent years in the doldrums, but investors' enthusiasm for flotations is wearing thin after share falls by some high-profile IPO companies. Fund managers are particularly wary of businesses floated by private equity firms unloading companies they were forced to hang on to during the long aftermath of the financial crisis. Cinven will sell some of its existing shares to partly cash in on its investment but will keep a substantial stake in the business, Spire's chief executive Rob Roger told journalists. Let's see if that commitment is enough to entice investors to stump up the cash. Cinven created Spire when it bought Bupa's hospital business in 2007 for an enterprise value (which includes debt) of \u00a31.4bn. It hasn't taken any money out of the company since and hasn't revealed the equity value of Spire at the time of its investment, according to Reuters. The CBI has published a disappointing retail sales survey for June. The balance of retailers reporting rising or falling sales fell to +4 from May's +16 and was well short of the +24 expected in a Reuters poll. The CBI blamed weaker demand for food and clothing for slowing sales growth. Barry Williams of Asda, who chairs the CBI's survey panel, said: \"Slow wage growth continues to weigh on how much consumers are willing to go out and spend.\" Steve Collins at London &amp; Capital Asset Management points out that the survey has been unpredictable: The CBI says the forward-looking part of the survey was more optimistic: The pound has fallen slightly as investors continue to grapple with Mark Carney's testimony to the Treasury committee yesterday. Sterling was about 0.2% down against both the dollar and the euro. It fell to a one-week low against the dollar of $1.6952 and the euro rose to 80.315p, its highest in nearly two weeks. Reuters' headline, picking up on a comment from a currency trader, described Carney's shifting position as a \"flip-flap\". Here are some excerpts from Reuters' story: Sterling inched lower on Wednesday, adding to its biggest fall against the euro in more than a month after the latest salvo from Bank of England policymakers left investors increasingly confused over the outlook for interest rates. With Britain's economy steadily improving, the game on the pound for the past few months has been a to and fro on expectations for when the bank will deliver a first, potentially small and precautionary, rise in interest rates. Money markets suggest many investors expect that to be as early as November. However, a number of analysts and dealers say Governor Mark Carney has muddied the waters after two performances in a week that pushed market expectations on timing first one way then the other. On Tuesday Carney pushed back slightly against expectations the bank will raise rates before the end of this year, saying the economy still has slack to work through. \"Carney did himself no favours at all yesterday. People feel he is flipping and flapping over rates,\" said one London-based foreign exchange dealer. \"As a central banker you should seek to provide clear guidance and a consistent message. This guy is not giving that at the moment. The net effect today anyway is that people are less sure about a rate rise by the end of the year.\" Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou's initial public offering (IPO) of easyHotel appears to have run up against investor float fatigue. The \"super-budget\" chain has raised \u00a330m by listing on the junior Aim market in Haji-Ioannou's first flotation since easyJet in 2000. But the company only raised half the \u00a360m it was originally seeking. The 80p a share placing with investors values easyHotel at \u00a350m. Haji-Ioannou's easyGroup will own 55.7% and new shareholders will own 44.3 per cent of the business. Still, with investors increasingly wary of the flood of IPOs hitting the market, Haji-Ioannou has got the deal done. Here's what he said in the stock market announcement: I am delighted that with the backing of institutional investors easyHotel will be able to grow and prosper as an independent company. This is a great business model which will continue to prosper as it grows and meets the demand of budget conscious travellers around Europe and beyond. The transparency and scrutiny of the public markets will also allow me to step back from the company and enable me to focus on continuing my diversification strategy into other business and philanthropic activities. I anticipate I will remain a significant and supportive shareholder for a very long time. RBS and WPP bosses braced for shareholder anger at AGMs Wonga to repay customers \u00a32.6m after masquerading as law firm FTSE 100 falls on worries about effects of Iraq conflict US first-quarter GDP figures expected to show contraction In an extraordinary piece of news, the Financial Conduct Authority has fined Wonga, the payday lender, \u00a32.6m for ill treatment of customers. The stunning part is that Wonga wrote to customers in arrears using names of a fictitious law firm \u2013 the impressive sounding Chainey, D\u2019Amato &amp; Shannon \u2013 for two years to November 2010. It also wrote to customers under the banner of Barker and Lowe Legal Recoveries. Here's an excerpt from the FCA's statement: During this time, Wonga sent communications to customers in arrears under the names \u201cChainey, D\u2019Amato &amp; Shannon\u201d and \u201cBarker and Lowe Legal Recoveries\u201d, leading customers to believe that their outstanding debt had been passed to a law firm, or other third party. Further legal action was threatened if the debt was not repaid. In fact, neither Chainey D\u2019Amato &amp; Shannon nor Barker &amp; Lowe existed and Wonga was using this tactic to maximise collections by piling the pressure on customers. The FCA has just tweeted to say why there is no fine for Wonga: My colleague Jill Treanor is on to the story: More UK corporate news: Land Securities has won the tussle to buy a 30% stake in Bluewater, the shopping centre in Kent. Britain's biggest commercial property company will pay Australia's Lend Lease Corp \u00a3656m for the stake, which increases Land Securities' exposure to the south east of England. Land Securities' shares rose 0.6% but the FTSE's biggest gainers were British Land and Hammerson, both up more than 1%, which were in the running for the Bluewater stake but missed out. In UK corporate news, Shire has received a fillip as it tries to fend off a takeover approach from AbbVie of the US. The drug company said a US court had endorsed the company's patents on its top-selling hyperactivity drug Vyvanse. Shire is one of the FTSE 100's few gainers this morning, up 0.8%. Here's more detail courtesy of Reuters: The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey granted Shire's summary judgment motion in a lawsuit involving five generic drug producers, holding that patent claims protecting its medicine were both infringed and valid. The decision means generics companies Actavis, Amneal, Mylan, Roxane and Novartis's Sandoz unit cannot launch until Shire's patent cover ends in 2023, unless they win the case at appeal, the London-listed company said. There's some encouraging economic news coming from Germany. Consumer confidence in Europe's largest economy has strengthened with economic expectations at a three-year high, according to the GfK survey for June. Here's an extract from GfK's press release: The mood of consumers in Germany is more optimistic again. After remaining at around the same level for the past four months, the consumer climate in Germany improved once more in June. Following a revised value of 8.6 points in June, the overall indicator is forecasting 8.9 points for July. Economic expectations climbed to a three-year high and willingness to buy also recorded a slight increase. In contrast, there was little change in income expectations. The consumer climate is further boosted by the slump in propensity to save which was caused by the interest rate decision of the European Central Bank. The FTSE 100 index is down 41 points, or 0.6%, in line with falls in other European indices. The fall follows sell-offs in the US and Asia yesterday on worries about the conflict in Iraq. Here's Reuters' early take: European shares fell in early trade on Wednesday, mirroring a pull-back on Wall Street and in Asia as mounting worries over violence in Iraq prompted investors to book recent strong gains. At 0702 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.5 percent at 1,379.41 points. The biggest FTSE faller is Meggitt, which makes components for \"extreme environments\" in the aerospace, defence and energy industries. Its shares are down 2.7% with Tullow Oil the next biggest loser, down 2.5%. Today's main economic news comes from the US where the commerce department will release its final revision to annualised first quarter GDP. Analysts expect the figure, released at 1:30pm UK time, to swing from an earlier estimate of a 1% contraction to shrinkage of about 1.7%. There will also be data on new orders for US-made long-lasting goods and financial data firm Markit releases its \"flash\" gauge of services sector activity for June. In the UK, the CBI will release its survey findings for June retail sales, which are expected to show a pick-up in activity on the high street. With markets still digesting Bank of England governor Mark Carney's comments on monetary policy at the Treasury committee yesterday, the committee will question Anthony Habgood, the Treasury's choice to chair the Bank's court, or board. The session may not be as market sensitive as Carney's appearance but it's worth keeping an eye on. Questions have been raised about the Bank's handling of the foreign exchange-rigging scandal and whether the court is doing its oversight job properly. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, business and the eurozone. We've got two big and potentially entertaining UK annual general meetings (AGMs) today. WPP, the world's biggest advertising agency, holds its AGM at noon at the Shard in London. We report today that about 30% of shareholders are likely to withhold support from the company's pay plan which could pay Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive, \u00a3100m in shares over three years. The vote will be binding under rules brought in by Vince Cable, the business secretary, last year. My colleague Juliette Garside will be at the meeting. Royal Bank of Scotland's AGM follows at 2pm from its Gogarburn HQ on the outskirts of Edinburgh. As we report, the state-controlled bank is expected to face questions about executive pay and Scottish independence with the in/out referendum just three months away. It's the first AGM for newish chief executive Ross McEwan. Julia Kollewe will report the main action from Edinburgh.",

After having initially been reported as a 0.1% rise, then a 1% contraction, the third release shows that GDP growth is now reported as -2.9% quarter on quarter, annualised, which leaves annual growth at just 1.5% year on year. The consensus expectation was for a -1.8% reading.</p> <p>\"The damage was largely done through the private consumption component, which is now reported as rising just 1% versus 3.1% previously. Gross private investment remained an 11.7% contraction while government consumption was left at -0.8%.

      "bodyText": "The US economy shrank at an annual rate of 2.9% in the first three months of 2014 \u2013 its fastest fall since the depths of the recession five years ago, as the harsh winter took a far bigger toll on activity than previously estimated. James Knightley, economist at ING \"US first quarter GDP has been revised lower by far than expected. After having initially been reported as a 0.1% rise, then a 1% contraction, the third release shows that GDP growth is now reported as -2.9% quarter on quarter, annualised, which leaves annual growth at just 1.5% year on year. The consensus expectation was for a -1.8% reading. \"The damage was largely done through the private consumption component, which is now reported as rising just 1% versus 3.1% previously. Gross private investment remained an 11.7% contraction while government consumption was left at -0.8%. However, exports were revised down and imports revised up meaning that the contribution from net trade is to subtract 1.5% from GDP growth rather than 0.95% as previously announced. \"Nonetheless, reaction should be fairly muted given widespread expectations of a sharp bounceback in the second quarter of 2014 and the fact that the weather had such a damaging impact on first quarter activity.

      "bodyText": "The US economy has shrunk at its fastest rate since the depths of the recession five years ago as it emerged that the harsh winter took a far bigger toll on activity than previously estimated. Official data released in Washington showed that output as measured by gross domestic product fell at an annual rate of 2.9% in the first three months of 2014. But the much worse than expected performance was shrugged off by Wall Street, where shares were up in early trading amid confidence that the economy bounced back strongly once the weather improved in the spring. Optimism was boosted by the latest snapshot of the US service sector that showed the sharpest increase in activity since the survey began four and a half years ago. Earlier traders in New York had been taken unawares when the Department of Commerce published its third estimate of US first quarter growth. Originally, it was thought output had increased by 0.1% at an annual rate in the quarter ending March but this was adjusted to a 1% decline at the second reading. The gap between the second and the third estimates was the largest on record, with the consensus on Wall Street for growth to be revised down to a annualised fall of 1.7%. Officials at the commerce department said the downward revision to growth had been the result of lower consumer spending on health care and a weaker than previously estimated contribution from exports. Nancy Curtin, the chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management said: \"The US economy didn't just grind to a halt in the first quarter \u2013 it hit reverse as the polar vortex took its toll.

It's clear that growth has gone up through the gears in the second quarter, and we'll see this reflected in the next GDP reading.\" Gautam Batra, Investment Strategist at Signia Wealth, said: \"The bad weather will have played its part, but the figures also raise questions about the efficacy of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing programme in creating a sustained economic recovery. The Fed faces headwinds to its monetary policy strategy with a cocktail of growing inflationary pressure and weaker than expected economic traction.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sunny weather and the fanfare surrounding the World Cup failed to persuade shoppers to open their wallets in the month to June, with retail sales growth falling to its lowest level since January. According to the latest CBI barometer of retail sales, buoyant growth during spring and early summer has given way to a markedly less rosy picture as shoppers react to persistently low pay rises and the threat of higher mortgage rates later this year. After a recent improved run for the high street, a fall in clothing and food sales dragged down growth, the survey found. The results follow a pattern set by official figures for retail sales in May, which showed that shoppers were generally unwilling to spend after a spree in March and April. The CBI found that the balance of the number of retailers reporting that their sales were up year-on-year retreated markedly to a seven-month low of +4% in June from +16% in May and +30% in April. The Office for National Statistics found that the volume of retail sales fell 0.5% in May, compared with a 1% increase in April as consumers stocked up on goods for Easter. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said some correction in retails sales was always likely in May after they were lifted in April by the late Easter, but they had been expected to pick up in June with the help of the World Cup. \"Hopefully, this will turn out to be just a blip after sustained strong retail sales in recent months. Even so, the loss of momentum in retail sales does raise question marks as to how strong consumer spending can be until earnings growth picks up appreciably,\" he said. Wages only increased by 0.7% in May according to official figures, well below the rate of inflation, which in May fell to a five-year low of 1.5%. Consumers are also becoming increasingly wary of rising interest rates, despite conflicting messages from the Bank of England on when rates might start to go up. The latest Markit household finances survey showed a huge jump in expectations of an interest rate rise, with 60% of respondents preparing for a rise from the current 0.5% in the next six months, compared with only 30% the previous month. Archer said the falls should not be overplayed and that the latest hard data showed underlying strength in retail sales, while the CBI survey revealed retailers were relatively upbeat over sales prospects with a balance of +17% expecting their sales to be up year-on-year in July. Barry Williams, the chair of the CBI's survey panel and Asda's chief merchandising officer for food, said: \"While it seems that hopes retail spending would be boosted by a strong performance by England at the World Cup were as over-ambitious as aspirations for a good performance, I'm reassured that consumer confidence is still on the up, as household budgets are being bolstered by falling inflation. \"However, whie discretionary income is still on the rise, slow wage growth continues to weigh on how much consumers are willing to go out and spend.\"",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons began expanding its online grocery service to the whole of north London on Wednesday in the struggling supermarket's latest bid to grab a share of the fast-growing online grocery market. The service is part of the supermarket chain's plan to turn around falling sales and profits by tapping into home deliveries and convenience stores as well as cutting thousands of prices to make it more competitive with discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl. Morrisons finally launched its online grocery service, which operates via a partnership with specialist Ocado, in January 2014, more than a decade after most of its major rivals integrated e-commerce into their business. It now delivers to Warwickshire and Yorkshire and has been testing the London market in a 250 sq km area near Ruislip, in the north-west of the capital, since early May. Morrisons faces tough competition in its next phase as London is already well served by rivals. The UK's biggest online grocer Tesco operates a whole network of so-called dark store mini distribution centres which enable it to offer fast deliveries across the capital. But Morrisons aims to deliver across London as part of its bid to reach half of all British households by the end of this year. Simon Thompson, managing director for online food at Morrisons, said: \"We're aware that we're up against other more established services and the competition is fierce. However, our online distribution model is different to the other major supermarkets, and is already delivering an industry-leading service to customers.\" The company will be offering delivery slots from a cost of \u00a31 and claims 95% of its deliveries arrive on time.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to face shareholder attacks at its annual meeting on Wednesday after paying out \u00a33.4bn in bonuses in the past four years. Executive pay and Scottish independence will be centre stage at the loss-making bank's meeting at its Gogarburn headquarters on the outskirts of Edinburgh. RBS, which is 80% taxpayer-owned after receiving a \u00a345bn bailout during the financial crisis, doled out \u00a31.4bn in bonuses in 2010, with payouts falling to \u00a3576m last year, according to the Robin Hood tax campaign, which represents 115 UK organisations including Friends of the Earth and the TUC. It is the first annual meeting for chief executive Ross McEwan, who was promoted to the top job last October after Stephen Hester quit. David Hillman of the Robin Hood tax campaign said: \"When even a loss-making state-owned bank forks out billions in bonuses to its top brass it hammers home that bankers' pay is still out of touch with reality. Such vast sums could be put to better use tackling poverty and protecting public services. Unfortunately, the government often seems intent on defending the privileged elite in the City rather than ensuring they play a more productive role in society.\" After Treasury opposition, RBS had to ditch plans to pay its bankers bonuses twice the size of their salaries, but the government is not stopping the loss-making bank from handing executives payouts of up to 100% of pay. McEwan is in line for \u00a31m a year in \"share allowances\" that sidestep the EU bonus cap and are also used by other banks. Shareholder group Pirc has advised investors to vote against RBS's pay policy. From 2014, executives will get up to 400% of salary through the share allowance and long-term incentives. \"It is disappointing to see that the bank has found a way to circumvent the spirit\" of the new EU rules, Pirc said. McEwan and RBS's chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, are also likely to face questions from shareholders over whether the bailed-out bank would move to England if Scotland votes for independence in September. Business secretary Vince Cable and Bank of England governor Mark Carney have suggested that RBS would have to relocate to London, sparking fears about 3,000 jobs at its Edinburgh base. An EU rule states banks must be based in the same country as most of their business. In the case of RBS, which owns NatWest and a London-based investment bank, this is England. RBS has not commented on a possible move but highlighted the risks from a Yes vote in its annual report, saying there could be a \"material adverse effect\" on its business and prospects and it would also affect its credit ratings. Shareholders are also likely to quiz RBS's bosses about lending to small businesses. RBS investors will also vote on whether to remove the dividend access scheme, which gives the government priority over payouts and is seen as an obstacle to privatisation. It will cost the bank \u00a31.5bn to buy itself out of the scheme, but shareholders are likely to back the move. Analysts at Jefferies believe that RBS could reinstate dividends next year, with the float of its US business Citizens under way. A group of protesters plans to descend on the shareholder gathering to demand that RBS pull its money out of coal. Dressed as bankers, they will be handing out lumps of coal disguised as luxury chocolates (\"fossil rochers\") and holding placards reading \"RBS out of coal\". The World Development Movement claims RBS invests more in coal mining worldwide than any other UK bank.",
