      "bodyText": "Vince Cable bowed to political pressure on Friday to release details of the precise number of Royal Mail shares allocated to 16 priority investors in the flotation of the 500-year-old postal service. The investors were picked because they gave firm commitments to back the sell-off at an early stage. The business secretary revealed the number of shares sold to them following revelations that the investment arm of his advisers at City firm Lazard had made an \u00a38m profit selling shares in the first week. The list published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills showed that City fund manager Threadneedle received the highest allocation \u2013 about 19.5m, equivalent to a 2% stake \u2013 and Third Point, the US hedge fund led by activist investor Daniel Loeb, the smallest at 5m \u2013 0.5% of the company. It shows 46m of the 220m shares allocated to the 16 priority investors were to hedge funds, 51m to sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East and Asia and the remainder to big City investors. During questioning by MPs on the business select committee this week, Cable offered \"absolutely no apology\" for the pricing of the shares at 330p, despite their immediate 38% rise in value. He refused to publicly name the six \"priority investors\", who profited from selling their stakes almost immediately. When asked if some of the priority investors had sold shares quickly \"to make a quick buck\", he replied: \"Yes, that is what happened. It is how markets work.\" Cable originally said he would provide the MPs with a list of the 16 priority investors on the condition the names were kept confidential, but then reluctantly published them. Information previously published by the National Audit Office appeared to show that Third Point had sold its shares along with financier George Soros, but that more traditional investors such as Fidelity, Schroders and Standard Life had also sold part or all of their stakes. Most of the 16 firms contacted by the Guardian either declined to comment or failed to respond. However, investment firm Henderson said it still owned shares. Threadneedle said it was \"one of the Royal Mail's largest shareholders at 1.5% and is a committed investor in the company.\" Lansdowne said it had not sold shares. Cable wrote a letter to shadow business minister Chuka Umunna in which he revealed that two of the priority investors had received additional shares. \"For completeness, I should add that Capital Group and BlackRock had a number of other accounts that were allocated shares,\" he wrote. In reply, Umunna said he was \"demanding answers\" about which of the funds immediately sold their holdings and said he would ask further questions in parliament. Capital, which was allocated 17.5m as a priority investor, received another 5.1m shares allocated across two other accounts and BlackRock, which was allocated 19.2m as priority investor, another 2.35m shares across three other accounts. Martin Donnelly, permanent secretary for the business department, had said in his appearance before the public accounts committee: \"We were trying to build a stable investor base. We did not seek formal commitments from investors to stay investors because that would have come at a price, and we did not want put that price on the taxpayer.\"",

      "bodyText": "As he robustly and correctly rejected Pfizer's latest takeover pitch, Leif Johansson, chairman of AstraZeneca, could also have quoted these wise words: \"Call me old-fashioned, but I think you have to be something. I don't buy that you can be this mid-Atlantic floating entity with no allegiance to anybody except the lowest tax rate. You're British, you're Swiss, you're American or you're Japanese. Whatever you are, you're something. And this company is a British company. \"We have given a lot to Britain, but Britain has given a lot to this company. The company wouldn't exist without the work of British people, without the contribution of British universities, without the support of the British government.\" That was Sir Andrew Witty of GlaxoSmithKline \u2013 head of Britain's other big pharmaceutical firm. He was talking about his own company in an interview with the Observer in 2011 but his remarks could equally apply to AstraZeneca. Big pharmaceutical businesses do not exist in a vacuum. Glaxo and AstraZeneca are major players, in part, because the National Health Service has spent heavily on novel medicines and because scientific research in British universities is excellent. Yes, both firms have done international deals. And, yes, AstraZeneca might properly be described as an Anglo-Swedish firm with a French chief executive. But British identity is intact and has strengthened in recent years. Glaxo, after its merger in 2000, found that living in limbo-land between Philadelphia and London was not the best way to operate; the pull under Witty has been towards Britain. AstraZeneca has settled on Cambridge for its new \u00a3330m head office and research centre. The company already accounts for almost 9% of research and development spending in Britain and 2% of exports. Corporate identity matters in the pharmaceutical game; investment and jobs inevitably follow. David Cameron, George Osborne and science minister David Willetts are deceiving themselves and the public if they believe otherwise. Their attitude seems to be: \"We have no powers to block this deal, so we'd better cover our backs by extracting a few vague pledges.\" Thus Willetts boasts that Pfizer has \"moved a long way from where they were a week ago.\" This is feeble. The government is undermining AstraZeneca's defence strategy by feeding the sense that Pfizer will prevail. More importantly, ministers are ignoring the nature of the beast. Pfizer's short-term promises about investment in the UK don't matter a jot because the group lives in a perpetual state of reinvention. Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth have been thrown into the takeover mixer to overcome humps in earnings and the outcome is always the same: deeper cuts in research than elsewhere in Big Pharma land. One pledge to Cameron is to keep \"a minimum of 20% of the combined company's total R&amp;D workforce in the UK.\" This sounds solid but isn't. Until he alighted on AstraZeneca as a useful deposit for corporate cash held overseas, Pfizer chairman and chief executive Ian Read was tempting his shareholders with a strategy based on spin-offs and demergers. He may return to the theme. After another rotation of Pfizer's assets, it might be impossible to say what \"the combined company\" actually was or is. Note, too, that Read wrote himself a mighty get-out clause: \"We make these commitments for a minimum of five years, recognizing our ability, consistent with our fiduciary duties, to adjust these obligations should circumstances significantly change.\" A change in circumstances? That could mean anything. The character of Pfizer is most tellingly revealed by its ideas on tax. This deal stands or falls on Pfizer's ability to flip its tax domicile to Britain via a so-called \"inversion.\" The UK offers a lower rate of corporation tax \u2013 20% versus as much as 40% in the US \u2013 and just 10% on drugs within the new patent box. In other words, Pfizer wants to pay a little more tax in Britain but a lot less in the US. One can see the appeal for its shareholders, but this is corporate disloyalty at its purest. Pfizer has enjoyed rich pickings from a US healthcare system where patented drugs are the most expensive in the world yet it seeks cheaper rent in a country where it has no roots. Witty's striking description from 2011 \u2013 \"a mid-Atlantic floating entity with no allegiance to anybody except the lowest tax rate\" \u2013 describes today's Pfizer to a tee. The head office will stay in New York. Pfizer just wants to be a tax tourist. This is not the \"march of the makers,\" of which Osborne used to speak. It is the sweaty jog of accountants. In the City, the betting is that Pfizer will improve its offer from \u00a350-a-share to, say, \u00a355 and win because Johansson and chief executive Pascal Soriot will be bludgeoned by their shareholders to accept. AstraZeneca's shares were trading at \u00a336 at the start of the year and drug development is risky. Two cancer compounds in late-stage clinical trials hold promise but no guarantees. Most fund managers are hard-wired (and incentivised) to prefer jam today. Let's hope this plot turns out differently. Maybe Pfizer's plans for tax emigration will exhaust Washington's patience with \"inversions.\" Certainly, it is hard to understand why AstraZeneca's board could grant, with integrity, a recommendation if the bidder plans to pay mostly in its own shares and hasn't secured binding approval for a flip from the US tax authorities. Another way the takeover attempt could fail is if politicians and the public make a fuss. Nothing must imperil Britain's \"open doors\" policy on takeovers, comes the cry from the City. Rubbish. We're not talking about Curly Wurlys and Creme eggs, a la Cadbury in 2010. The future of life sciences in Britain matters more than the freedom of Pfizer's tax department to play clever games. If Lord Sainsbury, former science minister and serious philanthropist, feels a takeover would \"deal a devastating blow to our profile in the pharmaceutical area, which I think is going to be critical in the next 30 years,\" it is surely sensible to explore his fears. As for Ed Miliband, who usually has views on modern capitalism but has been inexplicably silent, this ought to be an open goal. If he makes a few calls, the Labour leader may even discover there are still old-fashioned types in Britain's boardrooms who think the tax-motivated bid stinks. Sing it out loud: Pfizz off, Pfizer, we don't trust you.",

    "webTitle": "New face of Ryanair hopes social media will help change of image take off", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There is a curious anticipation about meeting the heir to Michael O'Leary as the public face of Ryanair: like watching the Incredible Hulk in reverse, all raging monster before a glimpse of mild-mannered scientist Bruce Banner. But the appointment of Kenny Jacobs as chief marketing officer was enshrined as part of the Ryanair revolution when O'Leary, the chief executive, decided he himself was getting in the way of efforts to convince the public that the Irish airline's customer service had changed. O'Leary, who had only ever referred to social media with contempt, was suddenly on Twitter, enthusing about web engagement and customer relations management. Ryanair would be signing up customers and \"CRM-ing the hell out of them,\" he promised. Step forward digital evangelist Jacobs, 40, to present a smoother version of the Irish charm \u2013 even if he's reluctant to be designated the new face of the low-fare airline. \"He said that, I didn't say that \u2026 I was hired to be the person for customers at Ryanair. But I'll be talking for Ryanair quite a bit, because the big things I'm accountable for \u2013 the brand, customers, the websites \u2013 will be what we need to talk about.\" Jacobs, a native of Cork, hired from Moneysupermarket and formerly at Tesco, is suitably deferential to the boss. \"He gets great headlines, long may that continue. But we've got a broader mix, we're starting mainstream advertising, and using our own media \u2013 like airports, aircraft and websites \u2013 to do a lot more communication.\" The airline's customer service rebirth, announced as a decision to \"stop unnecessarily pissing people off\" last July, has included ditching a website that deterred casual visitors in favour of an all-embracing online strategy. Jacobs plans to forge a reviewing community and speaks the digital lingo: \"The most interesting thing is Ryanair facilitating user-to-user content \u2013 this is Kenny from Manchester who's gone on a golf tour in Poland with three mates, why here and not Spain, how was it? It's much more powerful than brand-created content \u2013 it lends authority, it's Ryanair for the people, by the people.\" The O'Leary of 2012 \u2013 dismissing the thousands of people on Facebook who supported a passenger complaining about being charged \u00a3236 to print four boarding passes \u2013 might have raised a disbelieving eyebrow, but Jacobs insists: \"It'll be you and me putting stuff on Google+, Facebook, Instagram. Content meets social meets mobile, that trinity is what it's going to be about.\" The relaunch hasn't been without hiccups \u2013 a botched revamp saw the website disappear from many Google flight searches \u2013 but Jacobs is confident the blip will not affect them, with the power of the Ryanair brand meaning only a fraction of potential passengers arrive online via generic searches. A website that works fully on mobile devices, along with a new app and electronic boarding passes, will arrive in late June. He is also excited about a new farefinder feature: \"I want to fly from Stansted this weekend, spend \u00a3100 max on the flight, where can I go to? It's like flight roulette.\" Starting to register its massive customer base \u2013 81 million passengers last year \u2013 will be \"the fulcrum on which the whole platform will turn. Tell us where you go, what do you like to do. It's what other businesses do, so it's not a Eureka moment.\" So why did it take Ryanair so long? \"There was a bit of 'if it isn't broke don't fix it'. But the competition changed and the customer changed. It's down to digital: there's full transparency of information, everyone's going mobile, and customers want you to make it easier for them. There was a big need to respond.\" His arrival has seen the airline's first TV advertising campaign in decades, three 20-second clips backed by an old Marvellettes track, which Jacobs claims to have had heard described with the unlikely Ryanair accolade \"classy\". Ryanair will significantly increase marketing spending, but the ads do not signal a wholesale loosening of the famously tight purse strings. \"There is relentless focus on low cost. We used our own staff in the ads, we shot them in Stansted and we did it in one day.\" Anyway, he insists: \"I'm a bigger believer in making the product itself better. That's more important than just doing ad campaigns saying we've fixed everything, please forgive us.\" A section of the flying public may still feel Ryanair has much to be forgiven for, but Jacobs says: \"The Ryanair's-not-nice story is one that's principally UK and Ireland \u2013 but the brand is perceived in different ways across the 30 European markets. Some of the national flag carriers are incredibly inefficient and unreliable, and consumers in those markets love Ryanair.\" Whether other Europeans like it or not, more changes will come, he says: interiors, inflight entertainment, food, the business product. The future of the infamous Ryanair landing bugle is in the balance. Further ahead, transatlantic flights \u2013 when the right planes are available \u2013 will demand new levels of service. The silver lining of insane London house prices could be a low-fares transatlantic service from Stansted, he says: \"As the centre of London becomes impossible to buy, more and more people get pushed out into the catchment of Stansted. It's going to grow significantly.\" Pay-to-pee plans, in this new world, are definitely out. Jacobs says, though: \"I might do something interesting in the loos. It's an interesting space \u2026 you could make them a brand experience.\" Hours after we meet, a new Ryanair headline appears: Crew \"encouraged passengers to play rowdy toilet roll throwing game to win free booze\" on a flight to Tenerife. Not, perhaps, the brand experience Jacobs had in mind; but while he cracks on with the digital makeover, he can rest assured the headlines can take care of themselves.

      "body": "<p>There is a curious anticipation about meeting the heir to Michael O'Leary as the public face of Ryanair: like watching the Incredible Hulk in reverse, all raging monster before a glimpse of mild-mannered scientist Bruce Banner.</p> <p>But the appointment of Kenny Jacobs as chief marketing officer was enshrined as part of the Ryanair revolution when O'Leary, the chief executive, decided he himself was getting in the way of efforts to convince the public that the Irish airline's customer service had changed.</p> <p>O'Leary, who had only ever referred to social media with contempt, was suddenly on Twitter, enthusing about web engagement and customer relations management. Ryanair would be signing up customers and \"CRM-ing the hell out of them,\" he promised.</p> <p>Step forward digital evangelist Jacobs, 40, to present a smoother version of the Irish charm \u2013 even if he's reluctant to be designated the new face of the low-fare airline.</p> <p>\"He said that, I didn't say that \u2026 I was hired to be the person for customers at Ryanair. But I'll be talking for Ryanair quite a bit, because the big things I'm accountable for \u2013 the brand, customers, the websites \u2013 will be what we need to talk about.\"</p> <p>Jacobs, a native of Cork, hired from Moneysupermarket and formerly at Tesco, is suitably deferential to the boss. \"He gets great headlines, long may that continue. But we've got a broader mix, we're starting mainstream advertising, and using our own media \u2013 like airports, aircraft and websites \u2013 to do a lot more communication.\"</p> <p>The airline's customer service rebirth, announced as a decision to \"stop unnecessarily pissing people off\" last July, has included ditching a website that deterred casual visitors in favour of an all-embracing online strategy. Jacobs plans to forge a reviewing community and speaks the digital lingo: \"The most interesting thing is Ryanair facilitating user-to-user content \u2013 this is Kenny from Manchester who's gone on a golf tour in Poland with three mates, why here and not Spain, how was it? It's much more powerful than brand-created content \u2013 it lends authority, it's Ryanair for the people, by the people.\"</p> <p>The O'Leary of 2012 \u2013 dismissing the thousands of people on Facebook who supported a passenger complaining about being charged \u00a3236 to print four boarding passes \u2013 might have raised a disbelieving eyebrow, but Jacobs insists: \"It'll be you and me putting stuff on Google+, Facebook, Instagram. Content meets social meets mobile, that trinity is what it's going to be about.\"</p> <p>The relaunch hasn't been without hiccups \u2013 a botched revamp saw the website disappear from many Google flight searches \u2013 but Jacobs is confident the blip will not affect them, with the power of the Ryanair brand meaning only a fraction of potential passengers arrive online via generic searches. A website that works fully on mobile devices, along with a new app and electronic boarding passes, will arrive in late June. He is also excited about a new farefinder feature: \"I want to fly from Stansted this weekend, spend \u00a3100 max on the flight, where can I go to? It's like flight roulette.\"</p> <p>Starting to register its massive customer base \u2013 81 million passengers last year \u2013 will be \"the fulcrum on which the whole platform will turn. Tell us where you go, what do you like to do. It's what other businesses do, so it's not a Eureka moment.\"</p> <p>So why did it take Ryanair so long? \"There was a bit of 'if it isn't broke don't fix it'. But the competition changed and the customer changed. It's down to digital: there's full transparency of information, everyone's going mobile, and customers want you to make it easier for them. There was a big need to respond.\"</p> <p>His arrival has seen the airline's first TV advertising campaign in decades, three 20-second clips backed by an old Marvellettes track, which Jacobs claims to have had heard described with the unlikely Ryanair accolade \"classy\". Ryanair will significantly increase marketing spending, but the ads do not signal a wholesale loosening of the famously tight purse strings. \"There is relentless focus on low cost. We used our own staff in the ads, we shot them in Stansted and we did it in one day.\"</p> <p>Anyway, he insists: \"I'm a bigger believer in making the product itself better. That's more important than just doing ad campaigns saying we've fixed everything, please forgive us.\"</p> <p>A section of the flying public may still feel Ryanair has much to be forgiven for, but Jacobs says: \"The Ryanair's-not-nice story is one that's principally UK and Ireland \u2013 but the brand is perceived in different ways across the 30 European markets. Some of the national flag carriers are incredibly inefficient and unreliable, and consumers in those markets love Ryanair.\"</p> <p>Whether other Europeans like it or not, more changes will come, he says: interiors, inflight entertainment, food, the business product. The future of the infamous Ryanair landing bugle is in the balance. Further ahead, transatlantic flights \u2013 when the right planes are available \u2013 will demand new levels of service. The silver lining of insane London house prices could be a low-fares transatlantic service from Stansted, he says: \"As the centre of London becomes impossible to buy, more and more people get pushed out into the catchment of Stansted. It's going to grow significantly.\"</p> <p>Pay-to-pee plans, in this new world, are definitely out. Jacobs says, though: \"I might do something interesting in the loos. It's an interesting space \u2026 you could make them a brand experience.\"</p> <p>Hours after we meet, a new Ryanair headline appears: Crew \"encouraged passengers to play rowdy toilet roll throwing game to win free booze\" on a flight to Tenerife. Not, perhaps, the brand experience Jacobs had in mind; but while he cracks on with the digital makeover, he can rest assured the headlines can take care of themselves.</p> <h2>Michael O'Leary in his own words</h2> <p><strong>On rivals</strong> \"Attacking BA is like kicking a dead sheep - there is not much point any more.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "AstraZeneca rebuffs second Pfizer bid", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pfizer has turned up the pressure on AstraZeneca's struggle to remain independent with a second bid that valued the British pharmaceutical group at \u00a363bn. The UK firm immediately rebuffed the approach, raising expectations that its American suitor will abandon its attempt to get a friendly deal and launch a hostile bid directly at AstraZeneca shareholders. On a day of high-level corporate and political manoeuvring, Pfizer sought to assuage concerns in Westminster over jobs and investment at Britain's second largest drugs maker with pledges to spare scientific research from post-deal cutbacks. In a letter to David Cameron from Pfizer's Scottish-born chief executive, Ian Read, the company promised to: complete a \"substantial\" Pfizer research &amp; development hub in Cambridge; employ at least 20% of the combined company's total R&amp;D workforce in the UK; and locate some manufacturing in Britain. David Cameron welcomed what he described as \"robust\" assurances from the maker of Viagra on UK jobs and investment, in a statement that reaffirmed the government's apparent neutrality over what would be the largest ever foreign takeover of a British company if Pfizer returns with a third, successful bid. \"We should be really proud of [AstraZeneca] but, of course, the decision on any merger is a decision for the two companies and their shareholders,\" he said. Launching its latest bid on Friday, Pfizer, the world's largest pharmaceutical group, stressed it wanted to \"pursue a friendly, negotiated transaction that can be recommended by both our boards\". However, AstraZeneca remained firmly in the rejectionist camp, referring to the small cash element in the bid and a \"tax-driven\" structure that would domicile the new business in the UK and shield its non-US earnings from the US tax authorities. AstraZeneca's chairman, Leif Johansson, who spoke to Cameron after issuing the rebuff, said: \"We are showing strong momentum as an independent company.\" Johansson referred to the firm's \"exciting, rapidly progressing pipeline\", which includes cancer drugs that fight tumours with the body's own immune system. Johansson's resistance was bolstered by interventions from both sides of the political spectrum. Tory peer Lord Heseltine warned that Britain has inadequate mechanisms for dealing with foreign takeovers, while the shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, told Radio 4's Today programme: \"Do we really want a jewel in the crown of British industry, our second biggest pharmaceutical firm, to basically be seen as an instrument in some tax-planning game?\" Senior government figures joined Downing Street in welcoming Pfizer's assurances, with the business secretary, Vince Cable, making the most notable contribution. Cable, who began the week calling for more protection of British businesses, told the BBC: \"We've now received some assurances from the company that they will strengthen the British science base, they will protect British manufacturing. We need to look at that in detail, we need to look at the small print, we need to establish that it is binding but as far as it goes, on the basis of what we've seen so far, it is welcome and encouraging.\" The science minister, David Willetts, said Pfizer had \"moved a long way from where they were a week ago\". Pfizer offered \u00a350 a share, including \u00a315.98 in cash \u2013 compared with an informal bid in January worth \u00a346.41 per share or \u00a358.8bn. The cash element of the new bid is about 32% of the price, only slightly higher than the previously offered 30%. City experts have said a bid of \u00a353-56 a share might tempt AstraZeneca shareholders. Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou said on Friday he expected the offer to be raised towards \u00a355. However, AstraZeneca shares finished the day up slightly, rising 7p to \u00a348.08p as some investors and others waited for a new bid. Edison analyst Mick Cooper said: \"The response from AstraZeneca is not unexpected given that they cannot look as though they are rolling over at the first hurdle. The board is replete with former senior investment bankers who know how to run a good defence strategy.\" The board includes former Barclays boss John Varley, ex-UBS banker baroness Shriti Vadera and Swedish banker Marcus Wallenberg. Analysts are predicting a drawn-out takeover battle. Rae Ellingham at Charles Stanley advised investors with large holdings to lock in profits, saying there is no certainty a deal will happen. In his letter to David Cameron, Read said that he viewed the company's \"partnership with the UK government as a critical part of this potential transaction\". \"We believe the industrial logic for a combination between Pfizer and AstraZeneca is compelling,\" he wrote. \"Establishing the world's largest research-based pharmaceutical company in the UK, together with the commitments made in this letter represent a strong indicator of the incentives that your government has created to attract successful business to the UK,\" Read wrote. However, Labour's Umunna pointed to the tens of thousands of jobs that Pfizer has cut after each of its main three acquisitions: Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth. The 2011 closure of the bulk of its Sandwich lab in Kent \u2013 which invented Viagra \u2013 with the loss of 1,500 jobs caused an outcry. AstraZeneca employs 6,700 people in the UK. Former Labour science minister Lord Sainsbury said any assurances would be \"frankly meaningless\" given Pfizer's history of asset-stripping.Allan Black, of the GMB union which represents workers at AstraZenea's Macclesfield factory, said of Pfizer's latest pledges: \"Similar undertakings were given by US multinationals before which have proved to be worthless.\" Pfizer would benefit from the UK's lower corporation tax rate of 21% versus 38% in the US, which could save it $1.4bn a year in tax. It is also attracted by the \"patent box\", a lucrative tax break for new products developed in the UK. By 2017, companies will pay 10% tax on profits derived from UK-held patents. Big buyer Pfizer is an arch-exponent of multi- billion-dollar mergers. Some of its other deals include: 2000: Pfizer paid $90bn for Warner-Lambert, the US maker of anti-cholesterol treatment Lipitor, which became the world's bestselling medicine. 2003: Bought Sweden's Pharmacia for $60bn along with its pain-killing treatments Celebrex and Bextra, which was later pulled from the market. 2007: It snapped up Coley Pharmaceutical of the US for a relatively modest $164m in order to boost Pfizer's threadbare pipeline of new drugs. 2009: Paid $68bn for Wyeth, the US maker of Effexor, an antidepressant, and Prevnar, a child meningitis vaccine. 2010: Bought US competitor King Pharmaceuticals Sean Farrell",

We need to look at that in detail, we need to look at the small print, we need to establish that it is binding but as far as it goes, on the basis of what we've seen so far, it is welcome and encouraging.\"</p> <p>The science minister, David Willetts, said Pfizer had \"moved a long way from where they were a week ago\".</p> <p>Pfizer offered \u00a350 a share, including \u00a315.98 in cash \u2013 compared with an informal bid in January worth \u00a346.41 per share or \u00a358.8bn. The cash element of the new bid is about 32% of the price, only slightly higher than the previously offered 30%.</p> <p>City experts have said a bid of \u00a353-56 a share might tempt AstraZeneca shareholders. Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou said on Friday he expected the offer to be raised towards \u00a355. However, AstraZeneca shares finished the day up slightly, rising 7p to \u00a348.08p as some investors and others waited for a new bid.</p> <p>Edison analyst Mick Cooper said: \"The response from AstraZeneca is not unexpected given that they cannot look as though they are rolling over at the first hurdle. The board is replete with former senior investment bankers who know how to run a good defence strategy.\" The board includes former Barclays boss John Varley, ex-UBS banker baroness Shriti Vadera and Swedish banker Marcus Wallenberg.</p> <p>Analysts are predicting a drawn-out takeover battle. Rae Ellingham at Charles Stanley advised investors with large holdings to lock in profits, saying there is no certainty a deal will happen.</p> <p>In his letter to David Cameron, Read said that he viewed the company's \"partnership with the UK government as a critical part of this potential transaction\". \"We believe the industrial logic for a combination between Pfizer and AstraZeneca is compelling,\" he wrote. \"Establishing the world's largest research-based pharmaceutical company in the UK, together with the commitments made in this letter represent a strong indicator of the incentives that your government has created to attract successful business to the UK,\" Read wrote.</p> <p>However, Labour's Umunna pointed to the tens of thousands of jobs that Pfizer has cut after each of its main three acquisitions: Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth. The 2011 closure of the bulk of its Sandwich lab in Kent \u2013 which invented Viagra \u2013 with the loss of 1,500 jobs caused an outcry.</p> <p>AstraZeneca employs 6,700 people in the UK. Former Labour science minister Lord Sainsbury said any assurances would be \"frankly meaningless\" given Pfizer's history of asset-stripping.Allan Black, of the GMB union which represents workers at AstraZenea's Macclesfield factory, said of Pfizer's latest pledges: \"Similar undertakings were given by US multinationals before which have proved to be worthless.\"</p> <p>Pfizer would benefit from the UK's lower corporation tax rate of 21% versus 38% in the US, which could save it $1.4bn a year in tax. It is also attracted by the \"patent box\", a lucrative tax break for new products developed in the UK. By 2017, companies will pay 10% tax on profits derived from UK-held patents.</p> <h2><strong>Big buyer</strong></h2> <p>Pfizer is an arch-exponent of multi- billion-dollar mergers. Some of its other deals include:</p> <p><strong>2000</strong>: Pfizer paid $90bn for Warner-Lambert, the US maker of anti-cholesterol treatment Lipitor, which became the world's bestselling medicine.</p> <p><strong>2003</strong>: Bought Sweden's Pharmacia for $60bn along with its pain-killing treatments Celebrex and Bextra, which was later pulled from the market.</p> <p><strong>2007:</strong> It snapped up Coley Pharmaceutical of the US for a relatively modest $164m in order to boost Pfizer's threadbare pipeline of new drugs.</p> <p><strong>2009:</strong> Paid $68bn for Wyeth, the US maker of Effexor, an antidepressant, and Prevnar, a child meningitis vaccine.</p> <p><strong>2010:</strong> Bought US competitor King Pharmaceuticals</p> <p><strong>Sean Farrell</strong></p>",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Thomas Piketty: the French economist bringing capitalism to book", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was around 7.50 on Thursday morning when it became clear that Thomas Piketty had gone viral. Forget topping the bestseller lists. Forget the praise heaped on him by Paul Krugman. Never mind the hundreds of thousands of times his name is Googled. When Piketty was namechecked on Thought for the Day, he stopped being a modest 42-year-old French economist and went mainstream. In case you haven't noticed, Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century is a publishing sensation. It has already sold 200,000 copies, making it the 50 Shades of Grey of economics books. It is being reviewed on the internet by supporters and critics who self-evidently have not read all of its 577 pages. And it has jolted the right, who are scrabbling around for an answer to its main message: rising inequality is killing capitalism. But there is more to Capital than that. It is a big book in every sense of the word, using empirical evidence from 30 countries to describe how capitalism has evolved over the past 300 years and is now reverting to what Piketty calls the Downton Abbey world of a century ago. Where much modern writing about economics is cloaked in impenetrable jargon, Piketty is not afraid to draw on literature and popular culture to make his points. Quentin Tarantino gets a mention, as does the film Titanic. He likes Balzac and Jane Austen, he knows his Elizabeth Bennet from his Lady Mary. That said, it is still a book about economics, and many readers will find it hard going when they get to the sections on the Cobb-Douglas production function and the marginal productivity of capital. Like Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations and Maynard Keynes's General Theory it is a tome that will be more quoted from than read right through. The gist of Piketty's book is simple. Returns to capital are rising faster than economies are growing. The wealthy are getting wealthier while everybody else is struggling. Inequality will widen to the point where it becomes unsustainable \u2013 both politically and economically \u2013 unless action is taken to redistribute income and wealth. Piketty favours a graduated wealth tax and 80% income tax for those on the highest salaries. Lord (Adair) Turner, the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, says Capital is \"a remarkable piece of work\". Turner, who has name-checked Piketty in his recent lectures, added: \"He is saying that we have a set of tendencies at work to which the offset has to be a degree of redistribution. I completely agree with him.\" Krugman, writing in the New York Review of Books, says Piketty's work will \"change both the way we think about society and the way we do economics\". The book has also created waves on the right. Allister Heath, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said the book was flawed but admitted that supporters of capitalism were being \"slaughtered on the intellectual battlefield\" and needed to get their act together fast. The problem for Heath is that Piketty's book seems to explain the brutal world of the Great Recession and its aftermath rather better than trickle-down economics. Capital speaks to the Occupy movement; it speaks to the under-25s in Britain whose real wages are 15% lower than at the end of the 1990s; it speaks to Generation Rent. Piketty finds the right's hostility strange. Despite the title's echo of Marx's magnum opus, he is a mainstream European social democrat rather than a Marxist. His argument is that the world is reverting to the Belle Epoque of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when conservatives such as Bismarck and liberals such as Lloyd George, Keynes and Roosevelt knew that change had to come. \"My object is to make people think,\" said Piketty. \"I am a defender of the free market and private property, but there are limits to what markets can do.\" Born in 1971, Piketty has a radical lineage. His parents were part of the generation of students that manned the Paris barricades in May 1968. As a young academic he spent some time in the US, but quickly returned. A rather shy man, he seems bemused by his rock star status. \"Economists are not highly regarded in France, so you have to be modest.\" He says that what is new about his book is that he has been able to collate data on such a scale. \"Until now there has been very little historical evidence.\" Piketty draws a number of conclusions from his meticulously compiled data: there is rising inequality in a number of countries; the world is moving in the wrong direction; something can and must be done. It is rare for economics books to fly off the shelves. Once in every generation, usually when the world has started to recover after a serious recession, there is a search for answers. Will Hutton's The State We're In was the must-buy book two decades ago just as Piketty's is today. Lord (Stewart) Wood, special adviser to Ed Miliband, says it is a \"really important book that has hit a nerve with its scale and scope\". Wood is impressed by the way it exposes sweeping historical trends and has shone a light on wealth as an issue. Admiring the analysis is one thing; accepting the policy prescriptions quite another. Labour will steer clear of some of Piketty's more radical suggestions, although the author of Capital can't see a problem. In Britain, the poorest half of the population owns just 3-4% of the wealth. It must be possible to do better than that, Piketty says, brushing aside suggestions that a wealth tax would destroy capitalism. \"You can't say that 1% off the wealth of the richest will kill the economy,\" he says.",

    "webTitle": "Network Rail to slash directors' bonuses from 160% to 20% of salary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Network Rail plans to rein in executive pay by slashing bonuses for directors, cutting the maximum award from 160% to 20% of annual salary. The reformed scheme would still potentially net the highest paid director up to an extra \u00a3135,000 a year, but will go a long way to defusing rows over bonuses that saw directors in line for seven-figure payouts from a state-funded company. Pressure has been heaped on Network Rail after inquiries into level-crossing safety. In 2012 directors waived all due bonuses after the company was found guilty of safety breaches that led to the death of two schoolgirls at an Essex level crossing in 2005. In a separate case in January this year, a court of appeal judgment again linked bonuses to railway safety, suggesting cutting bonus to \"incentivise the executive directors ... to pay the highest attention to protecting the lives of those who are at real risk from its activities.\" In March, the transport select committee also warned in a highly critical report on level-crossing safety that it would \"be very concerned if its remuneration committee awarded bonuses to executive directors this year\". Network Rail's mounting debts of around \u00a330bn will be added to the public balance sheet from September this year, shining a further light on its finances. Annual bonuses will be deferred for three years to allow the track operator's remuneration committee to satisfy itself that meeting performance targets \u2013 safety, train punctuality, cost-efficiency, investment delivery and passenger satisfaction \u2013 leads to a sustained improvement. No additional long-term awards will be made. Network Rail said directors' base salaries would not be altered to compensate for reduced bonuses. Richard Parry-Jones, Network Rail chairman, said: \"The potential to earn large bonuses is no longer sustainable in the environment in which this company operates. The executive directors and the board both recognise this and have responded by putting forward this radical new bonus proposal that sees directors bonuses massively reduced.\" He said while directors could earn more elsewhere, \"we are confident that the unique challenge of having the executive responsibility to decide how to most effectively run Britain's railway infrastructure is a huge motivation in itself for the kind of leaders that we need.\" Mark Carne, chief executive, said: \"No other company can offer its people the sense of satisfaction and pride that comes from delivering a public service, which is so critical to the country's infrastructure and economy. This is our unique selling point and why I'm confident that we will continue to retain and attract the best people. The bonus structure, for the five-year funding period starting April 2014, covers Carne, who earns \u00a3675,000, and group finance director Patrick Butcher (paid \u00a3391,000 in 2012-13, the last year of published salaries), network operations managing director Robin Gisby (\u00a3368,000) and route strategy director Paul Plummer (\u00a3346,000). However, these three directors more than doubled their base salary that year with bonuses, long-term bonuses and other benefits. Outgoing chief executive David Higgins was paid a total of \u00a3863,000 in 2012-13 and still anticipates a deferred bonus of \u00a3577,000 to be paid out in 2015. Labour's shadow transport secretary, Mary Creagh, said: \"We welcome the end of Network Rail's mega-bonuses. Most hardworking people struggling with the cost-of-living crisis receive no bonus for doing their jobs, let alone one that more than doubles their salaries. \"Commuter rail fares have risen 24% in four years. Labour would introduce a tough cap on rail fares.\" Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: \"We have been arguing the case against double-your-salary bonuses for 10 years and now, after taking \u00a310m in such unmerited bonuses, NR's top bosses have finally listened. \"Network Rail is a public company funded by the taxpayer to the tune of \u00a34bn a year. Safety should be its number-one priority, not imitating the 'get-rich-quick' mentality of wide boys in the City.\" The scheme will be voted on by members at Network Rail's AGM in July.",

This is our unique selling point and why I'm confident that we will continue to retain and attract the best people.</p> <p>The bonus structure, for the five-year funding period starting April 2014, covers Carne, who earns \u00a3675,000, and group finance director Patrick Butcher (paid \u00a3391,000 in 2012-13, the last year of published salaries), network operations managing director Robin Gisby (\u00a3368,000) and route strategy director Paul Plummer (\u00a3346,000).</p> <p>However, these three directors more than doubled their base salary that year with bonuses, long-term bonuses and other benefits.</p> <p>Outgoing chief executive David Higgins was paid a total of \u00a3863,000 in 2012-13 and still anticipates a deferred bonus of \u00a3577,000 to be paid out in 2015.</p> <p>Labour's shadow transport secretary, Mary Creagh, said: \"We welcome the end of Network Rail's mega-bonuses. Most hardworking people struggling with the cost-of-living crisis receive no bonus for doing their jobs, let alone one that more than doubles their salaries.</p> <p>\"Commuter rail fares have risen 24% in four years. Labour would introduce a tough cap on rail fares.\"</p> <p>Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: \"We have been arguing the case against double-your-salary bonuses for 10 years and now, after taking \u00a310m in such unmerited bonuses, NR's top bosses have finally listened.</p> <p>\"Network Rail is a public company funded by the taxpayer to the tune of \u00a34bn a year. Safety should be its number-one priority, not imitating the 'get-rich-quick' mentality of wide boys in the City.\"</p> <p>The scheme will be voted on by members at Network Rail's AGM in July.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 hit its highest level for nearly nine weeks, supported by a cocktail of takeovers, positive company updates and an improving global economy. Even the growing tensions in Ukraine, with continuing clashes between the country's troops and pro-Russian forces, failed to dampen investor enthusiasm too much. It was the healthcare sector which again dominated the bid news, with AstraZeneca in focus as predator Pfizer raised its initial offer from \u00a346.61 a share to \u00a350 but still found its advances rejected. AstraZeneca, which started the week at \u00a340.80, closed at \u00a348.08, down 7p on the day. Shire, which on Thursday reported a 40% rise in first quarter earnings, found itself the centre of a number of takeover tales. It was variously said to be a target for Botox maker Allergan - as a defence against an unwanted bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals - or AstraZeneca itself. Shire added 17p to \u00a334.67. In Europe, France's Alsthom was in the sights of both America's GE and Germany's Siemens. The latter meanwhile agreed to buy the energy business of Rolls-Royce, down 14p at \u00a310.26. Still with takeovers, Heritage Oil agreed to be taken over by a Qatari investment fund for \u00a3924m or 320p a share. Heritage, whose main oil production is in Nigeria, closed at 314.6p, down 0.4p. Overall, the FTSE 100 finished on Friday at 6822.42, up 13.55 points on the day and around 137 points on the week. This was its highest level since 4 March. On the economic front there were positive UK GDP figures showing growth of 0.8% in the first three months of the year, as well as a purchasing managers survey showing manufacturing at a five month high. In the US, the non-farm payroll figure came showed that 288,000 jobs were added in April, much better than expected. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said: As we go into the long weekend, most investors will be crossing their fingers and hoping that the Ukraine situation does not deteriorate, even as Russia seeks to call a meeting of the UN Security Council. [A] late bout of selling towards the closing bell is an indication that the market is still nervous trading at these levels. Among the companies reporting Royal Bank of Scotland rose 25.1p to 331.7p after first quarter profits rose to \u00a31.6bn from \u00a3826m a year ago. Lloyds Banking Group, up 0.12p at 79.62p, also pleased the City on Thursday with news that it planned to float its TSB business in eight weeks, as it reported a 22% rise in first quarter profits. InterContinental Hotels was 166p higher at \u00a321.90 following news of a $750m return to shareholders and a 6% rise in first quarter revenue per available room, a key indicator for the sector. It said current trading gave it confidence for the rest of the year. Analysts said it had another $1bn or so worth of property which could be sold and the proceeds returned to investors. Housebuilders, which have been in the doldrums recently, were supported by a positive note from Citigroup. The bank said: Valuation has become less stretched as share prices have fallen significantly over the last month and performed poorly YTD. Seasonally the sector typically runs out of steam into May and negative sentiment around higher UK interest rates may continue to weigh on sector share prices in the near term. However, looking out on a 12-18 month horizon and assuming that the macro backdrop remains favourable, we expect the sector to continue to deliver good growth in net assets and see more attractive valuations post the recent sell-off as offering opportunity. We believe investors with a more medium-term view should revisit the sector, which now offers, based on 2015 estimates, a number of stocks at a discount to long-run average valuation multiples despite the attractive recovery potential, strong balance sheets and prospect of capital returns. Barratt Developments was 6.6p better at 375p while Redrow rose 13.6p to 305p and Taylor Wimpey added 3.3p to 108.6p. But supermarkets fell back as Morrisons, down 1.3p to 196.2p, fired the first shots in a price war, cutting the cost of 1,200 products by an average 17%. J Sainsbury, which reports full year results on Wednesday, lost 3.8p to 321.3p while Tesco fell 1.05p to 285.5p. Finally troubled outsourcing group Serco had a tumultuous week as new chief executive Rupert Soames began work. It issued its second profit warning since January, announced the departure of finance director Andrew Jenner and unveiled a \u00a3160m placing at 320p a share to bolster its balance sheet. Its shares closed at 353.4p, up 13.4p on the day but down 50p on the week. Caroline de La Soujeole and Sam Thomas at Cantor Fitzgerald repeated their sell rating, saying: We believe that there is a significant amount of goodwill in the current share price. Mr Soames is clearly highly skilled and has a rock solid reputation but the turnaround of Serco carries significant execution risk, in our view. Staff morale is low, management attrition high, customer confidence needs repairing and the balance sheet remains weak. We caution that the new chief executive has barely got his feet under his desk and with the finance director stepping down there is a real possibility that we will see more \"kitchen sinking\" and possibly further cash calls.",

      "bodyText": "A quick afternoon summary: The latest US jobs report has beaten expectations, with 288,000 new jobs created last month and the unemployment rate hitting a five-and-a-half year low of just 6.3%. Economists say the latest non-farm payroll report shows that America's economy strengthened last month, after stalling over the winter. But there's also concern that more people left the labour force altogether, with the participation rate hitting its joint-lowest level since 1978. Average wages were also flat. With speculation swirling that Pfizer could go hostile in its bid for AstraZeneca, business secretary Vince Cable has welcomed the US company's pledges to support UK science. But Sir Richard Lambert, former head of the CBI, has issued a stern warning that Pfizer could break its pledges. Portugal's government has announced that it has completed the final stage of its bailout programme... ....but its lenders have cautioned that it must make a decisive break with the past, and implement sound economic policies. Our earlier summary covers the AstraZeneca/Pfizer deal in detail. We'll be back if anything dramatic happens - otherwise goodnight, have a good (long) weekend, and see you next week. GW Vince Cable, who started the week warning that governments need more powers over foreign takeovers, appears to have been swayed by Pfizer's latest pledges. The business secretary has told the BBC that: \"We've now received some assurances from the company that they will strengthen the British science base, they will protect British manufacturing. \"We need to look at that in detail, we need to look at the small print, we need to establish that it is binding, but as far as it goes, on the basis of what we've seen so far, it is welcome and encouraging.\" Back in America, the US stock market is climbing on the back of today's jobs report. The Dow Jones is up 32 points, or +0.2%, to 16594, above the record closing high hit on Wednesday. Portugal's Troika of lenders have just confirmed that the country is on track to exit its bailout this month, after the final review of its financial programme was concluded. But the ECB, the IMF and the EU also warned that the country faces tough challenges, even though its economic recovery is now broadening. Making Portugal dynamic, flexible and resilient is an ongoing challenge, they warned. In a statement, the Troika said: With the programme ending, it will be essential that Portugal commits to sound economic policies for the medium term. The currently favourable economic and financial conditions should not lead to complacency. Building on the social consensus and resilience demonstrated by the Portuguese people during the programme,, it would be appropriate that all actors in the society agree on the broad contours of a strategy to strengthen the economy\u2019s prospects for self-sustaining growth and prosperity. This will require a decisive break with the past and a commitment to profound and lasting change. Here's the full statement: Statement by the EC, ECB, and IMF on the Twelfth Review Mission to Portugal Portugal is on the brink of exiting its bailout, the country's government said today, after completing the final stage of its financial assistance programme. Ministers said they are ready for a smooth exit from its \u20ac78bn aid package, having passed the final review of its economy by its creditors. Deputy Prime Minister Paulo Portas told a press conference that: \"The conclusion (of the review) implies that the program is on a good path to its completion,\" Portas said the government will meet on Sunday to decide how to exit the bailout. It is expected to follow Ireland's lead and not sign up for a precautionary credit line. Our Wall Street correspondent, Dominic Rushe, flags up other points of concern in today's US jobs report: Problem areas remain. The unemployment rates for teenagers (19.1%), black people (11.6%) and Hispanics (7.3%), remain elevated but all dropped slightly last month. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) declined by 287,000 in April but still stood at 3.5m; these individuals accounted for 35.3% of the unemployed. The fall in the unemployment rate was also driven in part by a fall in the participation rate \u2013 the number of people in the workforce \u2013 which dropped to 62.8% from 63.2%. Here's Dominic's full story: US unemployment rate drops to lowest level in six years as 288,000 jobs added ING's Rob Carnell is also struck by the \"extraordinary weakness\" of US wage growth. This dipped back from 2.1%YoY in March to only 1.9% in April, with no increase in wages over the previous month, and no increase in average hours worked. There's plenty of concern over the drop in the US labour force participation rate last month, to just 62.8%, showing that more people dropped out of the labor market. That's the joint-lowest reading since 1978, as this chart cribbed from Business Insider shows: Rob Carnell of ING says: This fall reverses the recent trend of gaining labour participation as the labour market improves. Economist Justin Wolfers argues that today's report shows America's economy is getting back on track: Annalisa Piazza of Newedge Strategy says today's jobs report suggests US economy has 'gained some momentum' after its winter lull. She said the pick-up in the non-farm payroll, with 288,000 new jobs, is due to two main factors: The US economy seems to have emerged from the Q1 soft patch due to adverse weather conditions and positive effects emerged in the labour market. The late Easter is projected to have had a positive impact on the more seasonally-influenced factors (i.e retail and leisure and hospitality). This chart underlines how US workers aren't feeling the recovery in their pay packets, which will probably encourage the Federal Reserve not to react to the surprise drop in the unemployment rate. With thanks to Ben Eisen of Marketwatch: Here's Reuters early take on the US unemployment data: U.S. job growth increased at its fastest pace in more than two years in April and the unemployment rate dived to a 5-1/2 year low of 6.3 percent, suggesting a sharp rebound in economic activity early in the second quarter. Nonfarm payrolls surged 288,000 last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was the largest gain since January 2012 and beat Wall Street's expectations for only a 210,000 increase. The unemployment rate tumbled 0.4 percentage point, touching its lowest level since September 2008. The Labor Department attributed the decline to a drop in the number of unemployed people reentering the labor market as well as a fall in new entrants into the labor force.The economy stalled in the first quarter, weighed down by an unusually cold and disruptive winter. A slow pace of stock accumulation by businesses, while they work through a glut of goods amassed in the second half of 2013, also undercut growth. The employment report joins other upbeat data such as consumer spending and industrial production in suggesting the first quarter's 0.1 percent annual growth pace was an aberration and is not a reflection of the economy's otherwise sound fundamentals. No improvement in average hourly earnings in the private sector-- US private sector workers received an average of $24.31 per hour in April, which is the same as in March. And the average private sector working week was also unchanged, at 34.5 hours. It's not all good news - the Labour Force participation rate, which measures the proportion of people either working or looking for work, fell to 62.8% from 63.2% in March. That's one reason why the headline jobless rate has fallen so much. There's real shock that the US unemployment rate has dropped to 6.3% - economists had expected 6.6% America's economy also created more jobs earlier this year than we thought. March's non-farm payroll has been revised higher, to show 203,000 new jobs, from +192,000 before. And February's has been increased to 222,000, from 197,000. BREAKING: 288,000 new jobs were created across the US economy in April. That's the biggest rise since January 2012, and rather more more than economists had expected. And the US jobless rate has fallen to just 6.3% - the lowest since September 2008, the month in which Lehman Brothers collapsed. A senior UK business leader, Sir Richard Lambert, has gone public with his concerns over a Pfizer's takeover of Astra. ITV has the story: We've had lacklustre eurozone unemployment data already, but how many new jobs were created in America last month? We find out in a few minutes, when the April Non-Farm Payroll is released.... Time for a quick recap: AstraZeneca's board has rejected the second, improved, takeover offer from America's Pfizer. After a meeting this morning, chairman Leif Johansson declared that Pfizer's new offer, of over \u00a363bn, was inadequate. Johansson told shareholders: Pfizer's proposal would dramatically dilute AstraZeneca shareholders' exposure to our unique pipeline and would create risks around its delivery. As such, the Board has no hesitation in rejecting the Proposal.\" Early this morning, Pfizer hiked its offer to \u00a350 per share, up from \u00a346.61, in shares and cash. It told the City that there was \"a highly compelling strategic, business and financial rationale for combining our businesses\" City experts predict that Pfizer could now launch a hostile takeover bid for AstraZeneca. Savvas Neophytou of Panmure Gordon said Pfizer will probably raise its bid to \u00a355 per share. Pfizer also wrote to David Cameron, making a series of pledges - including keeping 20% of its R&amp;D workers in the UK. There is no promise not to cut jobs, though, fuelling fears of heavy layoffs if the deal goes through. The prime minister said he has \"sought and received\" robust assurances from Pfizer. But Labour have accused the government of undermining the Astra board by talking to Pfizer. In other news.... The UK construction sector has grown for 12 months in a row Eurozone factory activity has risen, but France slipped back towards stagnation The Euro-area unemployment rate remained at 11.8% in March From Westminster, my colleague Nick Watt reports that David Cameron spoke to AstraZeneca's chairman, Leif Johansson, this morning shortly after Pfizer's improved offer was rejected (details at 10.59am). The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe are in close contact with both Pfizer and AstraZeneca making the points around the importance of the R&amp;D and skills and jobs base here in the UK. We make no apology for taking a strong interest in terms of jobs, skills, the R&amp;D base, for example AstraZeneca\u2019s Cambridge research facilities under development. \u201cThe government\u2019s view is that we want to continue to expand and develop the UK\u2019s skills base and R&amp;D base as a whole. Life sciences is an important part of that and we will keep making those points. \u201cThis is the approach you would always expect the government would take given the direct link through to such an important sector. AstraZeneca is one of our leading firms \u2013 a really strong tradition in terms of R&amp;D and product development. It is part of a very important life sciences sector in the UK.\u201d The spokesman also reiterated that the future of AstraZeneca is a matter for its shareholders. Prime minister David Cameron has declared that the government has received \"\"robust\" assurances from Pfizer, and defended his approach to the AstraZeneca offer. He was speaking at a Tory election campaign event in north Staffordshire. Press Association has the details: After being asked what guarantees he could give that jobs and investment in the UK would be protected, Mr Cameron responded: \"My priority is absolutely clear - British jobs, British science, British inventiveness, British research and development. \"We are seeing a revival in those things and I want to see that go further. \"AstraZeneca has a fantastic role in the British economy. You see it in the jobs it's created, in the investments it's made and the medicines it has delivered. \"We should be really proud of it but, of course, the decision on any merger is a decision for the two companies and their shareholders. \"My job is to protect the United Kingdom's interests. I want to see great jobs in these industries here in Britain. \"That is why we have sought and received robust assurances from Pfizer were a deal to go ahead. \"But it is not for us to endorse any deal, it is for us - the British Government, the British Prime Minister - to fight hard for Britain's interests and deliver Britain's interests. \"That is exactly what I will do. \"I will not make the mistakes of some previous governments. \"Outright hostility, abject surrender - that's what you have seen in the past. What I am interested in is results for Britain and that's exactly what you will see from our stance over this issue.\" Heather Self, a tax expert at Pinsent Masons, has explained why Pfizer is keen to use its huge overseas cash pile to fund the AstraZeneca takeover, and shift its tax base to the UK. She told the BBC: \"Pfizer want[s] to put a UK company on top of the whole group which is taking the whole company outside the US tax system.\" Ms Self reckons that a significant tax gain for the UK would be unlikely. \"All it will mean is moving a few senior people here and having a few board meetings here. It doesn't mean anything for the UK tax industry,\" The UK corporate tax rate is 21%, compared to 35% in America - encouraging Pfizer to keep cash from its non-US operations offshore. Rae Ellingham, analyst at Charles Stanley, says there's no guarantee that AstraZeneca will fall into Pfizer's clutches. Shareholders might want to take profits now, she says* In a note to clients, she says: Recommendation. We have a Hold recommendation but, with AZN wholeheartedly rejecting Pfizer\u2019s proposals, no certainty that an offer will be made, limited further upside and, in the case of an offer going ahead, a lengthy transaction process likely, encourage investors with large holdings to lock in profits. * - Caveat venditor! The Institute of Directors doesn't like the sound of British politicians blocking takeovers 'in the national interest'... Pfizer and AstraZeneca will hunker down for a long tussle, predicts Mick Cooper, analyst at Edison Investment Research. Cooper explains why it was logical for Astra's board to slap down today's \u00a350 per share offer: The response from AZN is not unexpected given that they cannot look as though they are rolling over at the first hurdle. The board is replete with former senior investment bankers who know how to run a good defence strategy. The AZN board will inevitably, either through results or through any further announcement, emphasis its growth prospect as an independent company and all the inherent value still to be unlocked from [CEO Pascal] Soriot\u2019s strategy for growth. Astra's rejection of Pfizer's latest bid has had little impact on its share price - it's down just 0.3% today at \u00a347.99. Pfizer may now go hostile in its bid for AstraZeneca, after seeing its improved bid rejected, City experts say: BREAKING: AstraZeneca has rejected Pfizer's new bid as \"inadequate\", saying it substantially undervalues it. In a statement to the City, the UK pharma firm said its board had met to discuss this morning's proposal, and had no hesitation in turning it down. The financial and other terms described in the Proposal are inadequate, substantially undervalue AstraZeneca and are not a basis on which to engage with Pfizer, the company said. Astra is also still conerned about the \"tax-driven inversion structure\" at the heart of the deal, and the fact that most of the bid is in Pfizer shares (just 32% in cash). Leif Johansson, Chairman of AstraZeneca, warned that Astra's pipeline of new drugs could suffer if Pfizer took it over. \"AstraZeneca continues to invest significantly in research, development and manufacturing in the U.K., Sweden and the U.S. We are showing strong momentum as an independent company, in particular with our exciting, rapidly progressing pipeline, which the Board believes will deliver significant value for shareholders. Pfizer's proposal would dramatically dilute AstraZeneca shareholders' exposure to our unique pipeline and would create risks around its delivery. As such, the Board has no hesitation in rejecting the Proposal.\" Eurozone employers made little inroads into the region's jobless crisis in March, leaving its unemployment rate painfully high. Statistics body Eurostat report that the euro area unemployment total fell by just 22,000 in March, leaving 18.913m people out of work and meaning the jobless rate was unchanged at at 11.8%*. Over the last year, it added, unemployment has fallen by 316 000 in the euro area and 929,000 in the whole EU (where the jobless rate was flat at 10.5%). Despite the debt crisis having eased, Europe's labour market remains in a troubled state. Martin van Vliet of ING explains: At 11.8%, the Eurozone jobless rate has hardly fallen from its 12% peak. This is partly because unemployment is lagging economic developments: the economic recovery has yet to feed through decisively to the labour market. But it is also because growth, although rising, remains too slow to generate enough jobs to make a serious dent in unemployment. Indeed, the past falls in unemployment seen in some peripheral countries to an important extent reflect a shrinking labour force due to emigration. This view is supported by survey measures of hiring intentions, which have improved, but are not yet at levels consistent with decent jobs growth. So in short, the labour market situation in the Eurozone seems to be slowly improving, which is encouraging, but real recovery has yet to kick in. Europe's northern core continues to boast impressively low jobless rates, while the southern periphery one in four adults is out of work. The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Austria (4.9%), Germany (5.1%) and Luxembourg (6.1%), and the highest in Greece (26.7% in January 2014) and Spain (25.3%). * - Eurostat also revised down February's reading, from 11.9% AstraZeneca's board is meeting this morning to consider Pfizer's new bid, Reuters reports. On Monday, AZ said that Pfizer's initial offer (of \u00a346.61 per share) significantly undervalued it, and emphasised its has strong prospects as an independent firm. More reaction to Pfizer's new pledges to the UK government, which fall short of a promise not to cut any jobs if the Astra deal goes through: Back to Pfizer's bid for AstraZeneca, and this chart shows why people are worried that a takeover would lead to heavy job cuts in the UK: RBS's CEO has admitted he's worried that the bankers bonus cap will make it harder to hold onto key staff. Ross McEwan told reporters this morning that he \"not going to pretend\" that the government's refusal to approve bonuses over 100% of salary is ideal. \"Not having the flexibility does have an element of risk for us, which I as the chief executive am going to manage...We will have to make some changes to those people to hold on to them\". Royal Bank of Scotland fears losing staff over bonus block Britain's construction firms have posted their 12th consecutive month of growth, with housebuilders driving the sector. Builders said April was another busy month, as an 'accelerated rise' in new orders drove them to take on more staff. Markit's construction PMI, which tracks activity in the sector, came in at 60.8, down from March's 62.5. That's the weakest reading since October 2013, but still shows very solid growth. Markit said that residential construction was the best performing broad area of activity, expanding at a rate rarely seen in the last decade. Moreover, the current 15-month period of continuous house building growth is the longest since 2006/07. Commercial activity increased sharply in April, while growth of civil engineering activity eased markedly and was the slowest since September 2013. Some firms noted a moderation in the boost to civil engineering activity from work related to flood relief. Tim Moore of Markit predicted that UK construction will grow strongly this year: Better economic conditions, a surge in house building, improved access to finance and greater investment spending are all important tailwinds for UK construction growth this year. Moreover, the latest survey is another indication that current UK construction trends are healthier than the relatively meagre official growth estimates so far this year. Over to the Eurozone, and factories across the region have reported a pickup in activity last month. Most of the region, anyway. France remains a laggard. Markit's monthly PMI index of eurozone manufacturing activity rose to 53.4 in April, from 53.0 in March, which shows stronger growth. France's manufacturing PMI, though, slid back to 51.2 from 52.1 -- close to the 50-point mark that shows stagnation. Reuters has the full story. Pfizer's new bid: what the analysts say Savvas Neophytou of Panmure Gordon predicts that Pfizer will eventually raise its offer again, towards \u00a355 per AstraZeneca share. Today\u2019s events force AstraZeneca\u2019s board to open formal discussions with Pfizer. This is a significant new step along the way.... Neophytou also reckons Pfizer may need to act fast to switch its tax base to the UK: On Tax inversion, which seems to be a significant motive in Pfizer\u2019s bid, one of the key themes remains the rule necessitates overseas ownership of &gt;20% to allow transfer of incorporation (re-incorporation). It should be noted that Pfizer may be under some considerable time pressure to consummate this deal, as President Obama is proposing a big move against tax inversions. In his draft 2015 budget - unlikely to pass in its current form; remember last year? - contains a provision designed to prevent inversions from happening by requiring a company to have 50% ownership outside the US to change its incorporation Louise Cooper, City analyst and commentator, cautions that governments, and ultimately patients, risk losing out from this kind of deal deal: I would warn all governments to be wary of consolidation in this industry. Clearly drugs firms have seen some big patent expiries and the glory growth days of the past are somewhat over. This is the reason that this deal is being proposed. However consolidation in an industry will reduce competition which leads to higher prices. Just in the past week, NICE turned down an Roche breast cancer drug because it was too expensive. Highly indebted Western governments cannot afford expensive drugs. They should be wary therefore of too much consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry. Is \u00a350 the end? Possibly not. Berenberg suggest that Pfizer can financially justify a \u00a355 offer. The Wall Street Journal's Helen Thomas points out that Pfizer's bid is still mainly in its own shares - which has worried Astra's investors. AstraZeneca has urged its shareholders not to take any action following Pfizer's improved bid, and said its board will discuss the offer. It said: The Board of AstraZeneca PLC notes the announcement made by Pfizer Inc. earlier today and confirms that AstraZeneca has received an indicative non-binding proposal from Pfizer regarding a possible offer for AstraZeneca (the \"Proposal\"). The Board of AstraZeneca will meet to discuss the Proposal and a further announcement will be made when appropriate. There can be no certainty that any offer will be made or as to the terms of any offer. Shareholders are strongly advised to take no action. Lord Heseltine, the former Conservative minister, has warned that the British government doesn't have strong enough powers to protect domestic firms from foreign takeovers. He told the BBC that: \"Foreign takeovers can often be hugely helpful but every other advanced economy has mechanisms of some sort on a failsafe basis to scrutinise foreign takeovers. We are the only country that doesn't. I think that is a mistake.\" He said there were lots of questions surrounding the Pfizer/Astra deal that needed to be explored including the UK's science base, supply chains and employment prospects. Umunna also accused the UK government of acting 'in concert' with the Pfizer board over the deal, and \"undermining\" the board of AstraZeneca. It is \"unheard of\" for a national government to be haggling with a foreign company in this way, Umunna said. David Willetts denied it, saying the government is pushing Pfizer very hard over the potential deal, and making it clear that they must commit to protecting and supporting the UK pharma industry. Shadow business minister Chuka Umunna has warned there is serious concern in the business industry, and the pharmaceutical sector, about the Astra takeover. Speaking on the Today programme, Umunna says: I've not spoken to anyone in the sector who has anything but grave reservations... He says Pfizer has a history of asset stripping, after previous takeovers. He also warns that the deal appears to be driven by Pfizer's desire to redomicile its business in the UK for tax purposes, asking: Do we want the jewel in the crown of Britain's pharmaceutical industry to be used for tax planning? Asked about Pfizer's letter to the prime minister, David Willetts says the company has \"moved a long way from where they were a week ago\". Science minister David Willetts is on the Today programme now, discussing Pfizer's improved bid for AstraZeneca. Willetts says the UK government has made it \"absolutely clear\" to Pfizer that it attaches great importance to Britain's pharmaceuticals industry, and its research and development operations. Ultimately, though, it's a decision for AstraZeneca's shareholders, Willetts says. But what about the threat to jobs -- Pfizer cut thousands of jobs in Sandwich three years ago? Willetts says that site is now a \"very vibrant\" business park --it's not been abandoned. Royal Bank of Scotland's shares have surged by 10% as traders hail the news this morning that its profits rose strongly in the last quarter. The rise in earnings was due to a big drop in RBS's impairment charges (losses on bad loans) during the period, which fell to \u00a3362m from over one billion pounds a year ago. Chief executive Ross McEwan, who is holding a press conference now, said: Today's results show that in steady state, RBS will be a bank that does a great job for customers while delivering good returns for our shareholders. But there's plenty of work still to do, McEwan added. Here's our full news story on Pfizer sweetening its takeover offer for AstraZeneca: Pfizer writes to prime minister and raises bid for AstraZeneca AstraZeneca shares are inching higher in early trading, up around 0.3% to \u00a348.30, from \u00a348.15 last night. That's quite a muted reaction to Pfizer's new offer of \u00a350 per share. However, they did surge by over 3% at the end of yesterday's trading session, as rumours swirled that Pfizer was preparing a higher offer. The London stock market is open, with the FTSE 100 dipping by 5 points to 6803. In other City news this morning, Royal Bank of Scotland has posted a sharp rise in earnings. The bank, still 81% owned by the taxpayer, posted pre-tax profits of \u00a31.6bn in the first quarter of 2014, up from \u00a3826m a year earlier. This is only the sixth quarterly profit since RBS was bailed out in late 2008. Sir Nick Scheele, former chancellor of Warwick University and ex-president of Ford, has urged the UK government not to interfere in Pfizer's approach to AstraZeneca. He told the Today Programme that commercial pressure was driving consolidation in the drugs industry, with firms under pressure as the patents on many lucrative drugs expire. It is clear that pharmaceuticals is in the midst of great change. Pfizer has made a series of pledges to the UK government today, in a letter to David Cameron. They include a promise to stick with a new AstraZeneca Science campus in Cambridge, and to keep a fifth of the combined company's research scientists in Britain. Here's the list: Pfizer commits to establishing the combined company's corporate and tax residence in England. Pfizer commits to complete the construction of the currently planned AstraZeneca Cambridge campus, creating a substantial R&amp;D innovation hub in Cambridge and the wider scientific community, which will include core research units, laboratory based scientific support lines and European clinical development and regulatory functions. Pfizer will base key scientific leadership in the UK who will lead all European and certain global R&amp;D functions based in Cambridge. Pfizer commits to integrate the operations of the combined company so as to employ a minimum of 20% of the combined company's total R&amp;D workforce in the UK going forward. Pfizer will actively look to locate manufacturing operations of the combined company in the UK, subject to the timing of the UK Patent Box proposals, and will retain substantial commercial manufacturing facilities in Macclesfield. Pfizer commits to base the combined company's European business HQ in the UK. Pfizer commits to base the combined company's EU Regulatory HQ in the UK. Pfizer commits to invite at least two AstraZeneca Board Members to join the Board of the new company. Pfizer commits to hold, as appropriate, Board Meetings in the UK and participate meaningfully in the UK commercial, economic and social community. CEO Ian Read told the PM: We view our partnership with the UK Government as a critical part of this potential transaction. Last night, former science minister Lord Sainsbury warned that the proposed takeover was \"undesirable' and could cause long term damage to Britain, citing Pfizer's track record of cutting jobs. An AstraZeneca spokeswomen has declined to immediately comment on Pfizer's new offer. Good morning. Pfizer has dramatically raised the stakes in its bid to take control of Britain's AstraZeneca, hiking its bid to \u00a350 per share this morning. Pfizer told the City that it was now prepared to pay around \u00a364bn for AstraZeneca, an increase of over \u00a34bn on its initial proposal which was rebuffed by its UK rival. It said: Based on these terms, Pfizer and AstraZeneca shareholders would own approximately 73% and 27%, respectively, of the new parent company. Our revised proposal values AstraZeneca at approximately \u00a364bn. The US pharmaceutical giant also published a letter to the prime minister, in which it tries to calm fears that the merger would cause serious damage to the UK's science industry (more shortly). Pfizer hopes the increased offer will persuade AstraZeneca to formally discuss what would be the biggest takeover ever by a British company by a foreign rival. Its CEO, Ian Read, declared that Pfizer has seen \"significant positive market reaction\" to its approach to AstraZeneca, telling the City that: \"The consistent message we have heard reinforces our belief that there is a highly compelling strategic, business and financial rationale for combining our businesses, with significant benefits for shareholders and stakeholders of both companies. We believe our proposal is responsive to the views of AstraZeneca shareholders and provides a sound basis upon which to arrive at recommendable terms for the combination of our two companies.\" Here's the full details of the new offer: On the basis of Pfizer's closing share price of $31.15 on 1 May 2014 and an exchange rate of $1.00:\u00a30.5919 on 1 May 2014, the proposal represents a premium of approximately: 32% to the unaffected closing price of \u00a337.82 on 17 April 2014 (being the date before market speculation of a possible offer by Pfizer for AstraZeneca); 39% to the closing price of \u00a335.86 on 3 January 2014, being the trading day immediately prior to the date of Pfizer's January proposal; 7% to the indicative value of Pfizer's January proposal of \u00a346.61 per AstraZeneca share; and 22% to AstraZeneca's all time high closing price (prior to 17 April 2014) of \u00a341.03 since formation of the company in 1999. But will it be enough to lure the AstraZeneca board to the negotiating table?

While the global head office would be in New York and the new company would have a New York stock market listing, it would be incorporated in the UK. Pfizer pledged to complete the planned AstraZeneca scientific campus in Cambridge and to base European and some global research and development in the UK. It promised to employ at least 20% of the combined company's total R&amp;D workforce in the UK, and to locate some manufacturing in Britain, including AstraZeneca's commercial site in Macclesfield. It invited at least two AstraZeneca board members to join the board of the new company.</p> <p>Umunna accused Pfizer of asset-stripping and making cuts in research facilities after previous acquisitions. The company cuts tens of thousands of jobs after each of its main three acquisitions: Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth. The 2011 closure of the bulk of its Sandwich lab in Kent \u2013 which invented Viagra \u2013 with the loss of 1,500 jobs caused an outcry.</p> <p>AstraZeneca employs 6,700 people in the UK. Former Labour science minister Lord Sainsbury said any assurances would be \"frankly meaningless\" given Pfizer's history of asset-stripping.</p> <p>Allan Black, of the GMB union which represents workers at AstraZenea's Macclesfield factory, said of Pfizer's latest pledges: \"Similar undertakings were given by US multinationals before which have proved to be worthless.\"</p> <p>Pfizer would benefit from the UK's lower corporation tax rate (21%, or 20% from next year, versus 38% in the US), which could save it $1.4bn a year in tax. It is also attracted by the \"patent box\", a lucrative tax break for new products developed in the UK. By 2017, companies will pay 10% tax on profits derived from UK-held patents.</p> <p>Analysts and tax experts say Pfizer wants to avoid paying the high US rate of tax on billions of cash earned overseas. Tax specialist Heather Self of the law firm, Pinsent Masons, said: \"Once the cash is offshore, the potential tax cost of repatriating it to the US makes it much more attractive to find other homes for it such as making foreign acquisitions.\"</p> <p>Neophytou said Pfizer could be under time pressure to complete the deal, as Barack Obama has proposed a big move against tax inversions. At the moment, companies need to have more than 20% overseas ownership to be able to be incorporated elsewhere for tax purposes.

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca has wasted little time in rejecting a new takeover bid worth \u00a364bn from Pfizer, after its US rival took the battle straight to 10 Downing Street. David Cameron declared that the government had received \"robust\" assurances from Pfizer on UK jobs and investment. \"We should be really proud of [AstraZeneca] but, of course, the decision on any merger is a decision for the two companies and their shareholders,\" he said. He spoke to AstraZeneca's chairman, Leif Johansson, shortly after Pfizer's improved offer was rejected. The Anglo-Swedish company's swift rejection raised the possibility that Viagra maker Pfizer could go hostile and appeal directly to AstraZeneca's shareholders. Hours earlier, the world's largest pharmaceutical group stressed that it wanted to \"pursue a friendly, negotiated transaction that can be recommended by both our boards\". The science minister, David Willetts, said Pfizer had \"moved a long way from where they were a week ago\". Business secretary Vince Cable, who began the week calling for more protection of British businesses, told the BBC: \"We've now received some assurances from the company that they will strengthen the British science base, they will protect British manufacturing. \"We need to look at that in detail, we need to look at the small print, we need to establish that it is binding, but as far as it goes, on the basis of what we've seen so far, it is welcome and encouraging.\" However, Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: \"Do we really want a jewel in the crown of British industry, our second biggest pharmaceutical firm, to basically be seen as an instrument of tax planning?\" Johansson said the board had no hesitation in rejecting the proposal, a few hours after it was made. It believed the new offer, raised from January's \u00a358.8bn bid, was still too low. It noted that the large share element and the tax structure of the new company remain unchanged. Pfizer offered \u00a350 a share, including \u00a315.98 in cash. This is about 32% of the price, only slightly higher than the previously offered 30%. City analysts have said a bid of \u00a353-56 a share might tempt AstraZeneca shareholders. Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou said on Friday he expected the offer to be raised towards \u00a355. AstraZeneca shares were up 10p to \u00a348.27 in afternoon trading on Friday. Edison analyst Mick Cooper said: \"The response from AstraZeneca is not unexpected given that they cannot look as though they are rolling over at the first hurdle. The board is replete with former senior investment bankers who know how to run a good defence strategy.\" The board includes former Barclays boss John Varley, ex-UBS banker baroness Shriti Vadera and Swedish banker Marcus Wallenberg. Analysts are predicting a drawn-out takeover battle. Rae Ellingham at Charles Stanley advised investors with large holdings to lock in profits, saying there is no certainty a deal will happen. Willetts said on Friday that the government had been having \"very tough conversations\" with Pfizer and had \"made it clear to them that the British government attaches great importance to the R&amp;D activities here in Britain and to manufacturing\". \"We have made it absolutely clear to Pfizer that we have a life sciences strategy,\" he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"It's aimed at boosting investment in Britain. It's working\u2026 We think a smart company would want to invest [in Britain].\" Pfizer's Scottish-born boss, Ian Read, wrote in a letter to David Cameron that he viewed the company's \"partnership with the UK government as a critical part of this potential transaction\". \"We believe the industrial logic for a combination between Pfizer and AstraZeneca is compelling,\" he wrote. Read has just returned to the US after a two-day trip to London, where he met the chancellor, George Osborne, other government ministers and major AstraZeneca shareholders. \"Establishing the world's largest research-based pharmaceutical company in the UK, together with the commitments made in this letter represent a strong indicator of the incentives that your government has created to attract successful business to the UK,\" Read wrote. He sought to reassure the government of Pfizer's long-term commitment to the UK. While the global head office would be in New York and the new company would have a New York stock market listing, it would be incorporated in the UK. Pfizer pledged to complete the planned AstraZeneca scientific campus in Cambridge and to base European and some global research and development in the UK. It promised to employ at least 20% of the combined company's total R&amp;D workforce in the UK, and to locate some manufacturing in Britain, including AstraZeneca's commercial site in Macclesfield. It invited at least two AstraZeneca board members to join the board of the new company. Umunna accused Pfizer of asset-stripping and making cuts in research facilities after previous acquisitions. The company cuts tens of thousands of jobs after each of its main three acquisitions: Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth. The 2011 closure of the bulk of its Sandwich lab in Kent \u2013 which invented Viagra \u2013 with the loss of 1,500 jobs caused an outcry. AstraZeneca employs 6,700 people in the UK. Former Labour science minister Lord Sainsbury said any assurances would be \"frankly meaningless\" given Pfizer's history of asset-stripping. Allan Black, of the GMB union which represents workers at AstraZenea's Macclesfield factory, said of Pfizer's latest pledges: \"Similar undertakings were given by US multinationals before which have proved to be worthless.\" Pfizer would benefit from the UK's lower corporation tax rate (21%, or 20% from next year, versus 38% in the US), which could save it $1.4bn a year in tax. It is also attracted by the \"patent box\", a lucrative tax break for new products developed in the UK. By 2017, companies will pay 10% tax on profits derived from UK-held patents. Analysts and tax experts say Pfizer wants to avoid paying the high US rate of tax on billions of cash earned overseas. Tax specialist Heather Self of the law firm, Pinsent Masons, said: \"Once the cash is offshore, the potential tax cost of repatriating it to the US makes it much more attractive to find other homes for it such as making foreign acquisitions.\" Neophytou said Pfizer could be under time pressure to complete the deal, as Barack Obama has proposed a big move against tax inversions. At the moment, companies need to have more than 20% overseas ownership to be able to be incorporated elsewhere for tax purposes. This could rise to 50% under the US president's plans. Former Conservative deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine also weighed into the takeover battle, saying: \"Foreign takeovers can often be hugely helpful but every other advanced economy has mechanisms of some sort on a fail-safe basis to scrutinise foreign takeovers. We are the only country that doesn't. I think that is a mistake.\" He told the BBC there were lots of questions that needed to be explored, including about the UK's science base, supply chains and employment prospects. Pfizer and AstraZeneca investors would own approximately 73% and 27%, respectively, of the new parent company.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland has said the government's refusal to back its bonus plans may make it difficult for him to keep the top staff he needs to pull off his turnaround plan. Ross McEwan was speaking as the 81% taxpayer-owned bank reported a jump in first quarter profits to \u00a31.6bn from \u00a3826m a year ago, alongside a return to profit of its troubled Ulster Bank \u2013 into which it has poured at least \u00a314bn since the banking crisis \u2013 for the first time in five years. McEwan was giving his first comments on the decision by the government to block RBS proposals to pay bonuses twice the size of salaries this year, rather than equal to salaries, the level imposed by the EU bonus cap. \"We are not going to pretend it's ideal. Not having the flexibility does have an element of risk for us, which I as the chief executive am going to manage,\" he said. \"We will have to make some changes to those people to make sure we hold on to them.\" The rise in profitability prompted a 10% rise in the shares to 347p during the day and made RBS the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100, though they dropped slightly to end the day at 331p . The \u00a317m profits at Ulster Bank were caused by the transfer of its most troublesome assets into RBS's new mini bad bank. McEwan will announce his plans for the bad bank \u2013 possibly including a merger with a rival \u2013 in the summer. McEwan refused to disclose precisely how many of RBS's 116,000 staff fall under the scope of the EU bonus cap. He said the most vulnerable areas included the restructuring experts in the new mini bad bank and those in the US operation Citizens, which is being prepared for a stock market flotation in the fourth quarter of this year, as well as what remains of its slimmed down investment bank. \"I want to make sure I'm in a position to pay these people so I can retain them for the value of this business,\" said McEwan, who would not disclose if this approach involved rises in salaries as well as giving out bonuses. The bank has cut 6,300 jobs \u2013 about 2,400 of which are in high street operations \u2013 as it tries to cut costs in an attempt to return to profitability. While the first quarter results were free of charges for mis-selling payment protection insurance and regulatory fines that have had an impact on results in the past, the bank warned these risks could recur. McEwan said: \"Today's results show that in steady state, RBS will be a bank that does a great job for customers while delivering good returns for our shareholders. But we still have a lot of work to do and plenty of issues from the past to reckon with.\" RBS is facing legal action from major City investors over disclosures made at the time of a \u00a312bn cash call in 2008 \u2013 six months before the taxpayer bailout \u2013 and McEwan said the bank would fight the claims. McEwan, who took over from Stephen Hester on 1 October, is trying to focus RBS increasingly on the UK and on retail customers, following a three-year strategy he set out in February when the 81% taxpayer-owned bank reported it had slumped to losses of more than \u00a38bn in 2013. The bank has also taken efforts to avoid a repeat of the IT meltdown in 2012 when customers of RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank were locked out of their accounts. It is seeking to ensure a problem in one brand's systems will not effect the others. RBS added that its outgoing finance director, Nathan Bostock, is to be sent on three months' gardening leave before taking up the role of deputy chief executive of Santander's UK arm in mid-August.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's manufacturing recovery powered ahead in the second quarter of the year, with growth well ahead of expectations in April, pushing the pound to a near five-year high against the dollar. A strong rise in output, new orders and employment all painted an increasingly rosy picture of the sector, which accounts for about 10% of the UK economy. Firms are adding jobs at the rate of 10,000 a month. The Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers index jumped sharply to a five-month high of 57.3 in April, from 55.8 in March, where any reading above 50 signals expansion. Economists had expected 55.4. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \"UK manufacturing continued its surging start to 2014, with output growth accelerating in April to a level among the highest signalled over the past two decades. Supporting these efforts are a strong domestic market and improving global economic conditions.\" Dobson said a backdrop of subdued inflation was likely to encourage Bank of England policymakers to maintain their \"wait and see\" approach to the recovery. Mark Carney, the Bank's governor, and fellow members of the interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, have made it clear in recent months that they are in no rush to increase borrowing costs. The first rate rise is likely in spring 2015. Interest rates have been on hold at 0.5% since March 2009. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at German bank Berenberg, said the manufacturing PMI showed there was no sign of slowing growth in the UK. \"To the contrary, it is probably accelerating. Record low interest rates are increasingly unnecessary and difficult to justify. As the economy is growing strongly and the Bank of England is now getting behind the curve, we expect rates to rise faster than the market expects, hitting 2.5% by the end of 2016,\" he said. Economic growth accelerated in the first quarter of 2014, to 0.8% from 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Manufacturing output alone was up 1.3% during the first three months of the year. The PMI survey provides the earliest indication of how manufacturing, and the broader economy, is faring, and is closely watched by policymakers at the Bank and within the Treasury. Manufacturers appear to be benefiting from a rise in domestic demand and modest recovery in the eurozone, Britain's biggest trading partner. Manufacturing export orders rose at the fastest rate since January, according to the PMI. The pound jumped to $1.6921 \u2013 its highest level against the dollar in almost five years \u2013 when the survey was published. The news is a further boost for the chancellor, who targeted manufacturing and exports in his March budget designed for \"makers, doers and savers\", as part of a push to rebalance the economy away from spending and financial services. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the PMI provided \"further encouraging evidence of a favourable rebalancing of the UK's economic recovery\". Manufacturers taking part in the survey increased the rate at which they hired new workers for a 12th consecutive month, to increase capacity at factories and meet higher demand.",
